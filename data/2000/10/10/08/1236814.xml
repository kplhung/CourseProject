        <p>Even though the design world is having a modern moment, the dollhouse world has been generally slow to respond -- until now. The Kaleidoscope House, which is manufactured by Bozart Toys and was designed by Laurie Simmons, an artist, and Peter Wheelwright, an architect, is a place a 21st-century doll can call home. Even better, it's filled with the efforts of a who's who of contemporary designers and artists.</p>
        <p>Inside the white-framed house, with its red chimney, sweeping blue roof and sliding, multicolored transparent acrylic walls, there's an almost relentless amount of fabulousness for a structure so small. A chair by Ron Arad sits across the double-height living room from a sofa by Karim Rashid; both enjoy a view of a Laurie Simmons photograph. (Simmons also designed the rugs and wallpaper.) Nearby, tiny Jonathan Adler pots sit on a white table, and the walls are hung with miniature paintings by Peter Halley and Carroll Dunham, Simmons's husband. Dakota Jackson designed the dining table and chairs.</p>

        <p>Even though the design world is having a modern moment, the dollhouse world has been generally slow to respond -- until now. The Kaleidoscope House, which is manufactured by Bozart Toys and was designed by Laurie Simmons, an artist, and Peter Wheelwright, an architect, is a place a 21st-century doll can call home. Even better, it's filled with the efforts of a who's who of contemporary designers and artists.</p>
        <p>Inside the white-framed house, with its red chimney, sweeping blue roof and sliding, multicolored transparent acrylic walls, there's an almost relentless amount of fabulousness for a structure so small. A chair by Ron Arad sits across the double-height living room from a sofa by Karim Rashid; both enjoy a view of a Laurie Simmons photograph. (Simmons also designed the rugs and wallpaper.) Nearby, tiny Jonathan Adler pots sit on a white table, and the walls are hung with miniature paintings by Peter Halley and Carroll Dunham, Simmons's husband. Dakota Jackson designed the dining table and chairs.</p>
        <p>Upstairs, under a photograph by Cindy Sherman, a thumbnail-size book, ''The Big Idea,'' by the novelist A.M. Homes, sits on the bed linens designed by the R.W. Kitchen Studio. (The house and its miniature furnishings were produced with the help of Herbin Ng, a student of Wheelwright's from Singapore, who also has a degree in product design.) In a child's room, a painting by Mel Bochner hangs above the bed; Lynne Tillman's postage-stamp-scaled book, ''My Life as a Cat,'' lies on the floor. (Like A.M. Homes's, it's just pretend.)</p>
        <p>When he first approached Simmons, Larry Mangel, the founder and president of the four-year-old Bozart, wasn't thinking ''ordinary.'' A former private art dealer who decided that there were too many badly designed toys on the market -- and too many artists who would welcome the chance to do better -- Mangel just ''had a feeling'' that Simmons would be a perfect addition to his roster of artist toy designers, ''from the way she interacted with dolls.'' Mangel is referring to Simmons's numerous photographs of dolls in miniature suburban-house environments, images that evoke both nostalgia and disquiet.</p>
        <p>Interestingly enough, Simmons at first resisted the idea. ''I had no interest in designing a toy,'' she recalls, ''even though my work seems as if it has to do with childhood imagery.'' But then Simmons went (on assignment for Nest magazine) to the Museum of the City of New York to photograph the legendary Stettheimer dollhouse. It was designed in the 1920's by Carrie Stettheimer, a sister of the painter Florine Stettheimer. With their other sister, Ettie, they were known for their friendships in New York's art world. The house is filled with tiny artworks by artists like Marcel Duchamp and Gaston Lachaise, who are themselves represented by tiny dolls.</p>
        <p>That experience was not lost on Simmons, who would soon be calling on her own art-world peers for contributions. ''It all came together, and made me interested'' in doing a dollhouse, she says. But Simmons also knew she needed an architect. Wheelwright, who is the chairman of the architecture department at Parsons School of Design, had designed two residences for Simmons and Dunham. (He had also roomed in college with Dunham and Mel Kendrick, who made a sculpture for the dollhouse.)</p>
        <p>Wheelwright designs in a contemporary mode, so there was no question of getting what Simmons calls ''a heavy Victorian thing your grandmother made by hand,'' but, as the architect explains, ''it wasn't just the style that needed updating.'' Most dollhouses, Wheelwright says, are accessible from only one side. So he and Simmons addressed the problem by devising transparent sliding walls that are accessible from all sides. Wheelwright also took pains to make the house as architecturally ''real'' as possible, even down to its structure, which includes a molded one-piece floor, and which stood up to numerous stress tests. ''This isn't a 'toy' house,'' Wheelwright emphasizes.</p>
        <p>Nor does it have ''toy'' occupants. Mom is modeled after Simmons, Dad after Wheelwright and the boy and girl after his son and one of her daughters. At first, Simmons wanted to populate the house entirely with children, but a child psychologist whom she consulted told her that children playing with the house would create a nuclear family out of the child dolls anyway, so Simmons opted for a more conventional family group.</p>
        <p>Next year, the house's population will grow. The Kaleidoscope Kids, a multicultural group of child miniatures, will be modeled after real children Simmons and Wheelwright know, in the style of the action figures that their children collect.</p>
        <p>When the dollhouse was shown at the American International Toy Fair in New York earlier this year, Bozart's stand drew crowds, and the Museum of Modern Art has devoted an entire page of its fall catalog to it. The house itself costs around $200 -- comparable to traditional models -- and the complete sets of furniture, art and figures add about another hundred. Mangel is hoping that the dollhouse ''will bring design to a whole new group of people.'' He adds, ''It walks that line between toys and grown-up things.''</p>
