        <p>A. J. Croce is known for his piano playing and his ability to write distinctive, insightful blues and jazz songs. His work demonstrating those talents has filled three albums since he began a recording career in 1993.</p>
        <p>The first album was a result, in part, of his performance inducting his father, the singer-songwriter Jim Croce, into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame. The induction ceremony led to an invitation by B. B. King to tour, and A. J. Croce has been touring with his jazz, blues, and roots-based music ever since.</p>

        <p>A. J. Croce is known for his piano playing and his ability to write distinctive, insightful blues and jazz songs. His work demonstrating those talents has filled three albums since he began a recording career in 1993.</p>
        <p>The first album was a result, in part, of his performance inducting his father, the singer-songwriter Jim Croce, into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame. The induction ceremony led to an invitation by B. B. King to tour, and A. J. Croce has been touring with his jazz, blues, and roots-based music ever since.</p>
        <p>But his current work has been influenced as much by the Zombies and the power pop groups of the 1960's as it has by Mr. Croce's blues favorites.</p>
        <p>Now he has made a dramatic turn to playing guitar as well as piano on the 12 new songs released on his latest album, ''Transit,'' on the independent label, Higher Octave, which gives the work a different flavor from the blues-based sound of his first three albums.</p>
        <p>Mr. Croce, backed by his band, will play at The Saint in Asbury Park next Saturday. Tickets are available at Ticketmaster or at the door.</p>
