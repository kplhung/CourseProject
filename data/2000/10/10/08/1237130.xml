        <p>WHEN Nissan Pathfinders roll off the slow boat from Japan, New York welcomes them with a hug. The Pathfinder is the most popular imported sport utility in the region; there seem to be at least a couple of them in every horn-blaring knot of congestion.</p>
        <p>Nissan's midsize S.U.V. is so common that it blends into the cityscape, like construction scaffolds and pedestrians who chat with themselves. But anything so familiar can become invisible, and it was easy to overlook the Pathfinder in recent years.</p>
        <p>The design, fresh and rakish in 1986, had grown tired. While competing trucks bulked up into sand-kicking V-8 brutes, the Pathfinder was still the skinny guy on the beach, stuck with a meek 170-horsepower V-6.</p>
        <p>So the 2001 Pathfinder did not arouse high expectations. This is still a truckish truck, arriving amid a wave of car-based ''crossover'' S.U.V.'s. It still has a solid axle at the rear, rather than the carlike independent suspension of the Mercedes M-Class or the next-generation Ford Explorer. It still has a cost-saving combination of front-disk, rear-drum brakes; many midsize S.U.V.'s have switched to discs all around. And Nissan's four-wheel-drive system had always been a relatively unsophisticated part-time affair.</p>
        <p>Yet after cranking the key in the first of two Pathfinder test vehicles I drove this year, I was won over before I made it across the Hudson. While the design and technology do not break much new ground, the truck is nicely executed in ways that count.</p>
        <p>A nose job midway through the '99 model year still looks fresh. As of this fall, a full-time four-wheel-drive system -- you can set it and forget it -- comes on the top model, the LE, unless you opt for two-wheel drive.</p>
        <p>The biggest change is one that drivers will appreciate each time their soles nudge the accelerator. The '01 models -- which came out early in '00 -- have a new engine, a dual-cam, 24-valve V-6 that displaces 3.5 liters. Derived from the exceptionally smooth and gutsy 3-liter in the Nissan Maxima and Infiniti I30, it produces up to 47 percent more power than the old V-6 (250 horsepower with a five-speed manual gearbox, 240 with a four-speed automatic).</p>
        <p>Nissan has bolstered the engine's pulling power at low to moderate engine speeds, suiting the needs of adventurers who tow boats or, well, find paths. In practical terms, this means that the new Pathfinder steps out smartly, outperforming many of those hairy-chested S.U.V.'s with big V-8's. It zips right into fast-moving freeway traffic, passes confidently on two-lane highways and bounds up steep hills without the gear-searching kickdowns of its predecessor.</p>
        <p>And thanks partly to electronic control of the valve timing, it accomplishes all this smoothly and quietly. The mileage rating -- 15 in town, 19 on the highway, with four-wheel drive and the automatic transmission -- hasn't changed despite the extra power, though the engine now requires premium fuel. The exhaust even growls a bit.</p>
        <p>This is not the usual truck engine, and the Pathfinder does not wear the usual truck body. Unlike most serious sport utilities -- the Jeep Grand Cherokee is a notable exception -- Nissan welds the body panels into a unit structure that is taut and solid, rather than bolting bodies onto a separate frame.</p>
        <p>Granted, this is a sport utility, not a sports car, and the handling has the usual limitations of a vehicle that sits high and heavy. High-speed cornering is problematic, and really rough pavement makes the wheels hop. Still, the driving dynamics are very good by S.U.V. standards -- so good that I found myself comparing the Pathfinder's feel with that of the radically different and far more expensive BMW X5.</p>
        <p>The rack-and-pinion steering, for instance, is quick and sharp, requiring a bit more effort than Japanese vehicles often do and giving excellent road feedback. On the highway, the vehicle tracks straight and true without a trace of drift. The ride, firm and well-controlled, is never harsh.</p>
        <p>From the minute you step in -- a relatively easy move, given the low step-in height -- you are bombarded with messages that this is a serious truck that will probably live long after the warranty expires.</p>
        <p>Consider the buttons, switches and control stalks: each responds to your touch with a trace of resistance, giving you a bit of tactile feedback and letting you know that your request -- to signal a turn, open a window, lower the temperature -- is taken seriously. These tiny messages add up to a stream of reassurance that you made a wise decision when you signed the papers at the dealership. If you've spent much time in Detroit products whose controls wiggle, jiggle and wobble, you will appreciate the difference.</p>
        <p>Pathfinders are assembled in Kyushu, Japan, and the workmanship on the test vehicles was nearly impeccable. The plastics are of high quality; the seams between panels are uniform. If you look closely, you find fewer bits and pieces. By using one large panel instead of two or four or six, Nissan cuts the odds that the cabin will be a concert hall for squeaks and rattles when the odometer reaches 50,000 or 100,000.</p>
        <p>Three models are offered. The low-volume XE is $28,169 with rear-wheel drive and automatic transmission. A sporty version, the SE, comes with a stick shift for $27,869; a four-wheel-drive SE with the automatic is $30,869. The full-dress model, the LE, is $31,819 with four-wheel drive; it tops out at $37,365 with leather, a navigation system and a video player for the back seat.</p>
        <p>The models now look different, particularly up front. The SE has a mesh grille, tubular running boards and titanium-colored bumpers and fender flares. Inside, there are titanium gauges, audio controls on the wheel and a truly useful six-disk CD changer built into the dash. The front windows zip up or down at the touch of a button -- a small but much-appreciated feature.</p>
        <p>The LE has a bold grille with a thick horizontal crossbar capped by a big Nissan emblem; running boards that blend neatly into the lower body; 16-inch, 6-spoke alloy wheels; white-face gauges; and a power sunroof. Seat-mounted side air bags are included with the leather-seat package.</p>
        <p>The seats are well designed, but the narrow, compact cabin isn't friendly to the large-limbed. Front legroom is barely adequate -- this seems true, to varying degrees, of all Nissans -- and the seats sit so high that the headroom of 6-footers is compromised. Anyone with a long torso may find himself, or herself, staring at the sun visors.</p>
        <p>So even though I never got comfortable sitting in the Pathfinder, I found it among the more rewarding S.U.V.'s to drive. Indeed, a leased '01 model recently joined my household's fleet, adding to the local parade of Pathfinders.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers may be hard to please, but Nissan seems to have figured out what we want in our sport utilities.</p>
        <p>INSIDE TRACK: Great hardware, better software and a much faster operating system.</p>
