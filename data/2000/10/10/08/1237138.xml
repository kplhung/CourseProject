        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You say (Week in Review, Oct. 1) that to many current and retired military officers, the recent endorsement by our group, Veterans for Bush-Cheney, ''seemed to cross the apolitical line'' and ''is raising concerns inside and outside the Pentagon about the growing politicization of the ranks.''</p>
        <p>The American people understand that it is wrong to remain silent when one honestly believes in something. Our history is replete with examples of occasions when men and women should have spoken out but did not. From a military standpoint, two of those times can be found in the drawdown of our forces after World War II and Korea.</p>

        <p>You say (Week in Review, Oct. 1) that to many current and retired military officers, the recent endorsement by our group, Veterans for Bush-Cheney, ''seemed to cross the apolitical line'' and ''is raising concerns inside and outside the Pentagon about the growing politicization of the ranks.''</p>
        <p>The American people understand that it is wrong to remain silent when one honestly believes in something. Our history is replete with examples of occasions when men and women should have spoken out but did not. From a military standpoint, two of those times can be found in the drawdown of our forces after World War II and Korea.</p>
        <p>Our group's members have chosen to speak out after carefully evaluating each candidate's stance on national security matters. We did so based on our extensive experience and knowledge. For us not to speak out would be wrong. Unfortunately, there are those who question our decision to speak, but such people have existed throughout our history.  CHARLES C. KRULAK  G. V. MONTGOMERY  Wilmington, Del., Oct. 2, 2000</p>
        <p>The writers are, respectively, a retired Marine Corps commandant and a former member of Congress.</p>
