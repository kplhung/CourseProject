        <p>WOODBURY remains a drawing card not only as a fine antiques center but also for its Saturday-morning Parisian-style flea market. And now there is a 210-year-old bed and breakfast born again as an inn.</p>
        <p>All along Main Street (Route 6) are homes, barns and mills that house individual antiques shops.</p>
        <p>''What is commonly thought of as Woodbury, the strip along Route 6, was an ancient thoroughfare,'' said Richard W. Crane, First Selectman of the Town of Woodbury. ''It was originally an Indian path. Today it retains its old American character, a showcase and blend of 17th-, 18th- and 19th-century homes, many listed on the National Register of Historic Places.''</p>
        <p>''In the early 70's,'' Mr. Crane added, ''the Zoning Board decreed that you could have a business in your home if the building was kept 50 percent residential. The law was incentive. It spurred the restoration of the stately homes on Main Street.''</p>
        <p>A visit to Mill House Antiques (1068 Main Street North, 203-263-3446) is an adventure housed in eight buildings including a 17th-century grist mill. The proprietors, Leslie White and David Veselsky, have created a lush setting overlooking a waterfall on 190 acres. There is a pool and pool house, sculpture and gardens, a sunken garden covered with a trellis of wisteria and enclosed with statuary. (''I love looking down long avenues,'' Mr. White said.) He  and Mr. Veselsky maintain an eye-catching stock of English and Welsh antique dining tables, chairs, dressers, sideboards, chests and accessories.</p>
        <p>A wooden bridge leads to Wayne Pratt (346 Main Street South, 203-263-5676), where a major restoration and expansion of the circa-1751 clapboard Colonial house has just been completed. A great room with high ceilings and a diamond-patterned stenciled floor now provides needed space for museum-quality American case pieces like chests, highboys and secretaries. Visitors enter through what was a former tavern. Nine rooms in all are filled with 18th-century American formal and country furniture and accessories as well as bench reproductions.</p>
        <p>David A. Schorsch American Antiques, in the Lamson-Hitchock House (244 Main Street South, 203-263-3131), specializes in classic folk art like weathervanes, whirligigs and gameboards. ''People are collecting them for their graphic appeal,'' Mr. Schorsch said.</p>
        <p>A soothing Scandinavian environment has been fashioned at Eleish-Van Breems Antiques (487 Main Street South, 203-263-7030), in the circa-1760 Thompson house and garden. One of the partners, Rhonda Eleish, said they wanted ''to combine interior and exterior.''</p>
        <p>''In Sweden,'' she said, ''being close to nature, sunshine, light and airiness is desirable.''</p>
        <p>Five rooms are filled with reflective mirrors, copperware and country furniture antiqued white.</p>
        <p>Country Loft Antiques (557 Main Street South, 203-266-4500) is housed in the Samuel Bull Homestead (1706), a 19-acre compound of houses, barns and a silo, with a lake and waterfall in the back. Carole Winer, owner and interior designer, combs France and England for armoires, kitchen accessories and wine-making tools. Ms. Winer specializes in designing wine storage and wine-tasting environments.</p>
        <p>Another wonder can be found at the Greek Revival house of Monique Shay (920 Main Street South, 203-263-3186). The house and a series of six connected barns built in the early 19th century are a showcase of French Canadian antiques: large painted and natural-pine armoires, cupboards, tables and accessories including pottery and bird cages.</p>
        <p>The two oldest establishments -- Mill House, at the northern end of Main Street, and Monique Shay Antiques, at the southern end -- create the anchors and boundaries of the district. Most of the other antiques shops fall along the six-mile stretch in between.</p>
        <p>Flea Market Thrills</p>
        <p>In contrast to these lush environments of fine antiques is the Saturday-morning Woodbury Antiques and Flea Market (203-263-2841), at the intersection of Main Street South and Sherman Hill Road, where a sea of vivid plastic cloths can be seen spread over dirt floors, some overlaid with Oriental rugs, draperies or tablecloths. The 14-acre setting is bowl-shaped (a reclaimed gravel bank) and surrounded by hills. Vendors buy a space for $30 and drive in.</p>
        <p>''The thrill of the flea market is that it is a real serendipity experience,'' said Diane Heavens, who with her husband, Don Heavens, own the property and operate the Saturday flea market (during the week it's a driving range for golfers.)</p>
        <p>''Some people come just for fun, to see what they can find,'' Ms. Heavens said. ''Others focus on specifics: antique tools, Depression glass or old wristwatches. But most are open to whatever the day will bring.''</p>
        <p>The market carries about 35 percent new merchandise (spices, kitchen tools and toys, for example) and 65 percent collectibles or antiques.</p>
        <p>''One guy is called the 50-cent man,'' Ms. Heavens said. ''He arrives with a pickup truck full -- the contents of attics, basements and tag sale leftovers. It's as if a bell rings. People swarm over.''</p>
        <p>For those embellishing a home with antiques, however, there is an ever-changing selection of garden etageres, Victorian engravings and furniture with prices that can run to several hundred dollars. ''The field opens at 5:30 a.m. and starts to quiet down at 1 p.m. with most dealers gone by 2,'' Ms. Heavens said. ''It's very much a morning experience.''</p>
        <p>Staying the Night</p>
        <p>For those wishing overnight accommodations there is the 250-year-old Curtis House (506 Main Street South, 203-263-2101), the oldest inn in Connecticut. Rates for two people in a room with a private bath range from $68 to $124.</p>
        <p>The current buzz, however, is about the 210-year-old Merryvale Bed and Breakfast, which closed for a year and reopened in June -- after a major facelift -- as the Longwood Country Inn (1204 Main Street South, Woodbury, 203-266-0800). It is now a  luxury getaway with four guest rooms and two suites with Jacuzzis. Each is decorated by the owners, Pat Ubaldi, formerly a fashion designer and her husband, Gary Nurnberger, an architect.</p>
        <p>In late August they also opened an intimate restaurant aglow with yellow and kiwi green walls, yellow nosegays in silver flutes, mahogany Sheraton chairs and French doors leading to an all-white garden.</p>
        <p>The restaurant's chef is Chris Rydell, a Culinary Institute of America graduate. The chef, inspired by the fare of the 18th-century gentry, has created an updated menu of lighter, more modern cooking. All baking is done on the premises, and each day a different herbal bread, appetizer and platter of cookies and truffles are offered in addition to dinner. Full breakfast is included in the room rate (one or two people) of $115 to $250 (usually 20 percent lower during the week.)</p>
        <p>A Taste of Strudel</p>
        <p>Other places to eat include John's Cafe (693 Main Street South, 203-263-0188), where the dining room (French ladder back chairs, black and white striped curtains and charcoal ceilings) is overseen by the chef-owner Bill Okesson. Also a Culinary Institute of America graduate, he said his food is French influenced, but new American in style. A tasting dinner ($60 a person) with wines was memorable for a strudel stuffed with duck comfit and cherries, lovely salsas and presentations as well as multiple desserts.</p>
        <p>More informal restaurants with something special about them include Theo and Gretchen's (125 Main Street North, Northwood Village, 203-263-6767), a large airy dining room with green leather booths that used to be called Sam's Place. It's an inexpensive, neighborhood gathering place for breakfast or lunch. Breakfast (served all day) includes Green Mountain eggs Florentine with apple-cinnamon or banana-walnut pancakes.</p>
        <p>And there's Carole Peck's Good News Cafe (694 Main Street South, 203-266-4663). Ms. Peck, author of ''The Buffet Book'' (Viking, 1997) and sometimes referred to as ''the Alice Waters of the East Coast,'' is a chef who celebrates the state's farm-fresh organic food. ''The emphasis is on healthy food with a little bit of frivolity,'' she explained. Pecan-crusted oysters served in a tasty melange of corn, apples, jicama, peppers and dry cherries were irresistible.</p>
        <p>Along the Way</p>
        <p>Other worthy stops include Peklo Design and Joinery (29 Pomperaug Road, 203-263-4566), at the mill perched on the waterfall at the Pomperaug River; it is where Andrew Peklo III, architect and joiner, makes contemporary furniture using traditional methods.</p>
        <p>Flanders Nature Center and Land Trust (Church Hill and Flanders Road, 203-263-3711), a 200-acre nature preserve, offers marked trails for hiking past ponds, streams and meadows of wildflowers.</p>
        <p>Woodbury Pewter Factory Outlet (860 Main Street South, 800-648-2014) displays a large variety of pewter items from tankards to coffee sets to baby spoons and jewelry. A seven-minute video offers an overview on how pewter is made, a small museum features the company's memorabilia and the history of the craft, and a window overlooks the operations.</p>
        <p>The Glebe House Museum and the Gertrude Jekyll Garden (Hollow Road, 203-263-2855) are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  The house, noted as the birthplace of the Episcopal Church in the New World, is also graced by a garden designed by one of England's most venerated designers, Gertrude Jekyll.</p>
