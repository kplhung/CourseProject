        <p>HAVE you been hearing strange sounds at night? Does your dog or cat get excited for no apparent reason? And what exactly was that you saw out of the corner of your eye?</p>
        <p>It might have been a mouse. Or a raccoon or a squirrel.</p>
        <p>October marks the onset of the  peak rodent season. Rodents invade homes during the fall, not because of cooler weather but because the seeds and plants they feed on are gone, sending them elsewhere for food.</p>
        <p>Think you've got mice? Unexplained crumbs, smudge marks along walls and bits of insulation on the basement floor are their calling cards.</p>
        <p>Still in denial? Sprinkle talcum powder in suspected areas. The morning after, look for footprints.</p>
        <p>''We were sitting at night watching TV, and I heard crumpling in the kitchen,'' said Fred Meyer of North Bellmore, who called in John Skurski of TNT Pest Control in Bellmore.  Upon inspection, Mr. Skurski found mouse droppings, similar in appearance to black rice.</p>
        <p>''This is their highway,'' Mr. Skurski explained, pointing to the basement pipes overhead. He surveyed the exterior of the house and discovered a possible entry point, a small crack under the siding, and sealed it with expanding foam. Then he put traps under the kitchen sink and in the basement.</p>
        <p>''Mice and their parasites are capable of transmitting a multitude of diseases such as hantavirus, salmonella, tapeworms, meningitis and encephalitis,'' said Walter Schroeder, the executive director of the Long Island Pest Control Association. The danger doesn't stop at disease: some home fires have been traced to mice chewing on electrical wiring.</p>
        <p>The common house mouse weighs less than an ounce; its life span is  little more than a year. But mice are prolific breeders and start reproducing just five weeks after birth. A pair of mice and their progeny ''can generate 200 offspring a year,'' Mr. Schroeder said.</p>
        <p>Their survival skills are legendary. A live mouse flushed down a toilet may well persevere and resurface within minutes. Mice can scale walls, jump 12 inches straight up, survive a fall of 12 feet and fit through a hole smaller than a dime.</p>
        <p>Their cousin, the rat, is considerably bigger, weighing close to a pound. Even so, a rat can fit through a hole the size of a quarter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Skurski can identify a rodent simply by sniffing the air. ''Rat urine smells different than mouse urine,'' he said. Rookie pest detectives can tell by the droppings: a rat's are  shaped like a large capsule.</p>
        <p>Rodents are best controlled by a combination of good housekeeping, rodent-proofing and traps, Mr. Skurski said. Nonrefrigerated food should be stored in closed jars or sealed plastic storage bins. Canned foods are safe from tampering. Bags and boxes of cereal, cookies and crackers are not. Bowls of pet food should be emptied and cleaned immediately after dogs and cats have eaten.</p>
        <p>Exterior holes at all heights should be sealed. Tiny openings around pipes should be stuffed with steel wool (don't use a soap pad, because the soap could attract mice). Doors, including the garage door, should have thick rubber sweeps. Clear away debris from the house foundation; it can harbor rodents. A nearby stack of firewood or pile of leaves can be their welcome mat.</p>
        <p>When it comes to traps, professionals prefer peanut butter as bait, not cheese. Glue traps or glue boards should be placed parallel to the wall,  and snap traps should be placed perpendicular to the wall with the trigger end closest to the wall. Bait an unsprung trap for a few days to gain the critters' trust.</p>
        <p>If peanut butter doesn't work as bait, nesting material sometimes will. ''If they won't take the bait, tie a cotton ball to the trigger as a nesting-material bait,'' said Tamson Yeh of the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Nassau County.</p>
        <p>When asked about ultrasonic and electromagnetic repellers, Ms. Yeh said: ''They're not very effective.  Mice and rats are very adaptive -- it will simply become background noise.''</p>
        <p>Poison will work, but it poses some problems. Although tamper-resistant bait stations claim to keep the poison inside, many exterminators suggest a no-poison approach. ''Mice fill their jowls with food, then leave and spit it out elsewhere to eat,'' said Joe Kennedy, a vice president of Arrow Exterminating in Lynbrook.  If it's an area with children, pets or food, contamination can occur.''</p>
        <p>Another danger is that poisoned mice may die within the walls. Besides causing quite a stench, the carcasses can attract parasite pests, which can then invade the house.</p>
        <p>Unlike mice and rats, which come inside in the fall looking for food, raccoons and squirrels are looking for warmth.</p>
        <p>A Massapequa homeowner heard scratching in her attic and called in Jose Padilla of Arrow Exterminating. ''Did you hear it at night or during the day?'' Mr. Padilla asked. ''At night if you hear a sound like a child walking, that's a raccoon.''  Squirrels make scurrying and scratching noises, usually in the morning when they go out for food, he said.</p>
        <p>An attic vent is often the entry point. On the Massapequa call, Mr. Padilla thought the culprits were squirrels. ''There aren't any trees nearby so it's probably not raccoons,'' he said. ''They're lazy. But squirrels will scurry across utility lines.''</p>
        <p>The next day, he had his proof: two trapped squirrels.</p>
        <p>To keep out squirrels and raccoons, Mr. Padilla and other pest-control professionals suggest trimming tree limbs that are close to the house, screening off or otherwise protecting attic vents, sealing any holes, and installing chimney caps. Not every exterminator is trained to deal with nuisance wildlife, but those that are hold New York State licenses.</p>
        <p>Exterminators don't always rely on traps to remove the animals.  ''Raccoons hate noise,'' Mr. Padilla said. ''The easiest way to get rid of them is probably playing Howard Stern or the news real loud.'' At that, he laughed.</p>
        <p>He recalled a recent job when he peered down a chimney and saw two raccoons looking up. ''We left the radio on next to the fireplace,'' he said. After the raccoons climbed out, he installed a chimney cap.</p>
        <p>Homeowners who exterminate rats and mice without batting an eye are sometimes reluctant to kill animals like squirrels and raccoons.  But Kelly Stang, a wildlife biologist at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, had this warning: When it comes to nuisance wildlife, it may seem humane, but it is illegal to trap and transport these animals any farther than your own property. ''You're giving your problem to someone else,'' Mrs. Stang said, ''and you're possibly moving diseases around.''</p>
        <p>Harold Harlan, a staff entomologist at the National Pest Management Association, pointed out that because squirrels and raccoons are territorial and fight to defend their turf, ''the transported animal is probably doomed to a life of extreme stress and a rapid death.''</p>
        <p>Although homeowners may trap and release an animal on their own property, it is likely to return to the house if the entry point has not been sealed. The law also allows homeowners to destroy the animal.</p>
        <p>Despite the tribulations of their business, pest-control professionals seem to be unfazed. Some exterminators whip out pictures (with ''new father'' enthusiasm) of crowded glue boards or tell animated stories of decaying possums lodged in pipes.</p>
        <p>When asked about the benefits of his occupation, Mr. Skurski replied, ''Animals and insects will always survive -- I'll always make a living.''</p>
        <p>A comforting thought, perhaps, for exterminators, but not exactly verbal Valium for homeowners.</p>
