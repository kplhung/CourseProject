        <p>Bette Midler does not watch television. She has never seen ''E.R.,'' watched ''Seinfeld'' only after she appeared on it and did not tune in to see her own astonishing performance as Johnny Carson's last guest on ''The Tonight Show.'' ''I always said I'd never watch anything stupider than me,'' Midler explains, sitting on the set of ''Bette,'' her television show that will have its debut on CBS on Wednesday night. ''And a lot of TV is really stupid. But movies are over for me. There's nothing there for me. It was so hard to get a picture.

So rather than wait for the ax to fall completely, because I like to work and I think I have a lot to offer, I said, That's it. Let's try television.''</p>
        <p>Midler, who is 54, removes an invisible crumb from her pale violet sweater. She is a tiny, delicately boned woman, around 5-foot-2 in her high heels. Today she is wearing cream-colored leather pants, a tight V-neck pullover and cat's-eye sunglasses, tinted blue. Her blond hair is pulled back in a ponytail, her toes are painted metallic gray and she has a large watch that slides up and down her wrist. Midler's face is at once open and closed. Because of her height, she tends to look up at things, as if the world were composed of fascinating tall trees. When she tilts her head up that way -- raising her chin coquettishly -- Midler is irresistible.</p>
        <p>Yet she's always shifting -- it is one of the complexities of her personality. Even more than most performers, she has distinct personas: there is the onstage Bette (bawdy, outspoken, brash) and there is the offstage Bette (proper, serious, second-guessing). Her work mode is a hybrid: concentrated and brisk, with the occasional aside. When Midler focuses, she is serious. She laughs, she jokes, but her eye is always trained on the work.</p>
        <p>She is focused at this moment on the script for the third episode of ''Bette.'' It is 11:15 on a recent Monday morning, on Stage 6 at Sony Culver Studios. In a few minutes, the cast will read this week's script aloud and get notes from the network executives, and then the writers will scurry off to make changes and tweak jokes.</p>
        <p>''Will you get me an espresso?'' Midler asks her assistant, taking a chair in the middle of a long table. Surrounding her are the cast and production crew of ''Bette,'' who are munching on large muffins, and a large number of network and studio executives perched on high deck chairs placed around the table. Bonnie Bruckheimer, Midler's longtime producing partner, sits next to the star, and Jeffrey Lane, the creator of the show, is at one end of the table, chatting with Andrew D. Weyman, the director of the first ''Bette'' episodes. In just 48 hours, the crew will begin filming location shots for the episode, and on Friday, the remainder of the episode (most of it) will be performed in front of a live audience. ''It's very fast,'' Midler says. ''I had no idea. I called Candy Bergen and she said, 'It's a dream job, but you don't go to the bathroom for the first year.' The other day I said: 'I have no time. I can't go to the bathroom.' And they said, 'Well, you went yesterday.' ''</p>
        <p>Much of Midler's exhaustion can be traced, perhaps, to the very premise of the show: she plays herself. Or rather, a version of herself, a cross between her outrageous (but warm) onstage persona -- the Divine Miss M. character -- and her real-life homebody character. The show exists as an odd sort of parallel universe: just as Midler has a real-life non-show-biz husband (Martin von Haselberg, a former commodities broker who doubled as a performance artist); a real-life teenage daughter (Sophie, who is 13 and attends private school in New York); a real-life best friend-business partner (Bonnie Bruckheimer) and a real-life accompanist (Marc Shaiman), so does her TV counterpart. ''I even auditioned to play myself,'' says Shaiman, who co-wrote the ''Bette'' theme song with Midler. ''But they decided to go another way.''</p>
        <p>The set of the ''Bette'' show -- a bedroom, living room and kitchen -- was modeled on rooms in Midler's own home. The decorating scheme, the window treatments, the cozy touches like the hook rug in the shape of a mermaid and the brightly colored Fiestaware plates are lifted from Midler's house. ''They took Polaroids,'' she says. ''It's very odd. My husband thinks the set is not grand enough. He thinks people don't want to see what my life really looks like, that they want the dream of how a star lives. I say, if they're looking at the set, I'm in deep trouble.''</p>
        <p>But the set, and the setup, will be important to the success (or failure) of ''Bette.'' More than usual, this show is dependent on the charisma of its star. Interestingly, the TV Bette character, like real-life Bette, scorns television -- on the show, she is, presumably, still a movie star. ''I just don't know if I should do TV,'' TV Bette exclaims in the pilot episode. ''I'll have my own series and then I might as well kill myself.''</p>
        <p>Traditionally, shows about show business do not entice viewers. There have been a number of shows in which performers play some version of themselves: Jerry Seinfeld, most recently, but also George Burns and Jack Benny. But none of these shows detailed the intricacies and machinations of a performer's life; to be too inside is dangerous for commercial television. ''Bette'' flirts with the line. There are in-joke references to Midler's movies, and her daily humiliations include missed phone calls from the likes of Steven Spielberg. But ''Bette'' never strays too far or too long from the home, where Bette is always the wife, mother and friend -- one who happens, like Lucy Ricardo before her, to be involved with the world of entertainment. ''On the show Bette is always human,'' explains Leslie Moonves, the president and C.E.O. of CBS, who helped persuade Midler to star in her own show after years of pursuit. ''And that humanity is what will attract audiences to the show.''</p>
        <p>The Lucy model is crucial. Midler reveres Lucille Ball, and she has appropriated two elements from ''I Love Lucy'': TV Bette is prone to mishaps, which result in elaborate displays of physical comedy. And while TV Bette is clearly a star, she is never the biggest star, or so she worries. TV Bette has daily struggles, just like you and me (and Lucy). Or, at least, that's the premise.</p>
        <p>The script for Episode 3 this Monday morning begins with Midler and Kevin Dunn, who plays her husband, Roy, fighting over her level of fatigue. TV Bette, like TV Lucy, is stubborn and willful and she doesn't listen to Roy or Connie (rhymes with Bonnie, as in Bruckheimer, played by Joanna Gleason). As Bette begins to rehearse ''Happy Talk'' from ''South Pacific'' with her pianist, Oscar (a witty James Dreyfus), her voice gives out midway through the first verse. For the rest of the episode, she will not utter a peep.</p>
        <p>It's a good premise. It allows Midler to mime whole scenes; and when she finds herself, as she usually does, in an awkward position, TV Bette cannot talk. This episode -- and the whole series -- is not, like ''Frasier'' or ''Seinfeld, ''based on verbal repartee. It is, like ''I Love Lucy,'' a star vehicle: a chance for Midler to sing, dance, do pratfalls, do physical comedy -- to be moving and, most of all, be funny. On this episode, everyone looks away and smiles upon hearing that TV Bette will have to be mute and then, immediately, frowns in sympathy when turning to look at her.</p>
        <p>It's a little predictable, but through force of personality and talent, Midler makes these bits fly. On the show, she is the show. ''They didn't know what to do with Bette in movies,'' Shaiman says. ''She's one of the last real entertainers. For her, that's like breathing in and out, but movies want a certain type, doing certain types of roles. That's not Bette. Her talent is limitless, and that's why this show might be great.''</p>
        <p>The episode is to end back in the kitchen, with the all-too-common half-hour-comedy husband-and-wife embrace. Dunn, who co-starred in ''Dave,'' has a soothing voice and a gentle comic touch, but he is no match for Midler, no Desi. Which is by design: the characters, and for that matter the writing, do not compete with the star. ''Everyone wants me to have a Kramer,'' Midler says, referring to Seinfeld's next-door neighbor, who stole most of the scenes he was in. ''I say, 'I am Kramer.' I want to have only straight people around me.''</p>
        <p>Midler may be (half) joking, but she knows how much the show is riding on her. Part of her, the ambitious part, is up for that: having been relegated to the role of one-scene comic relief in movies like ''Get Shorty,'' Midler is hungry. But part of her is a little overwhelmed too. ''Making the pilot was so much fun,'' she recalls. ''I hadn't used all these skills in a while. But now that we're on the third show, I can see that it's almost too much. If the script is at 20 percent on Monday, by the time you get to Friday, you have to work 1,000 percent to get the show to work. That is brutal. I find that process really exciting. Up to a point.''</p>
        <p>The reading ends and the network and studio executives applaud enthusiastically. They have almost no notes for the ''Bette'' staff, and they are beaming as they head back to their offices. Overall, CBS is ecstatic about ''Bette.'' The network is scheduling ''Bette'' opposite ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ABC's monster hit. Midler, who has never seen what she calls ''The Millionaire Show,'' was so concerned about her time slot that she phoned Moonves to complain. ''I told her that we could not move 'Bette' to 10 p.m., as she requested,'' Moonves says, smiling. ''I explained that no comedy had ever worked at 10 o'clock. Bette had no idea. She said: 'What? Don't people want to laugh at 10 p.m.? We could be first!' That's her general philosophy: what I don't know can't stop me.''</p>
        <p>It's later the same Monday, around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and Midler is rehearsing a scene that will take place in TV Bette's psychiatrist's office. She is studying her script in a leather club chair on the set. Although she is engulfed by the chair, she is sitting very straight and is fluttering her arms, which are very graceful, all around her, quietly rehearsing an elaborate pantomime she is about to perform. Since TV Bette is mute this week, she has to act out her psychological angst while the shrink interprets. It is the sort of tour-de-force moment that defines this show. Bette is given some magnificent, huge thing to do while others nod approvingly.</p>
        <p>That is the main reason Midler decided to venture into this medium. Bruckheimer, who was instrumental in persuading a very resistant Midler to try television, says: ''On TV, I told her she could do everything she wants to do: laugh, cry, sing, do physical comedy, anything. I would talk to her about it endlessly. Bette is always saying no, and then, when she finally says yes, she always tries to get out of it. A week before the Carson show, she called and said, 'You have to get me out of this.' She did the same thing with this show. But I convinced her. I thought, She's Bette Midler. If this show doesn't work, does that end 30 years of what she's done in her career? No. And, anyway, they don't write movies for her anymore, whether she's in a TV show or not.''</p>
        <p>TV is all about women; they are the true powers of the medium. Although networks quest after the coveted 18-34 white male demographic, it is women who actually watch, and what they like to watch is other women. Men are fickle: they gravitate toward ''event TV'' like sporting events or game shows, where the outcome is unknown and where they entertain themselves with dreams of athletic glory or quiz-show prowess. Women are different: they look for some version of themselves, young or old, fat or thin, and they find it in prime time.</p>
        <p>Unlike movies, television is character-driven. It's small. And the intricacies of personality can reveal themselves in a way that is not possible in a 90-minute film. Women respond to the intimacy of the medium -- they want to see Roseanne struggle with her kids the way they struggle with their kids; they like that Candice Bergen may have been great at her job but a mess at her personal life; they respond when Helen Hunt spars with her husband over the purchase of a couch on ''Mad About You.''</p>
        <p>''Movie stars, especially female movie stars, have to be glamorous,'' says Wendi Goldstein, the senior vice president for comedy development at CBS who helped shepherd ''Bette.'' ''They have to be larger than life. On TV, audiences are attracted to someone who is not so glamorous, who could be a friend. And that's especially true for the female audience.'' Yet, despite television being a land of opportunity for women, it does not have the cachet of film, and for a long time, Midler resisted moving to TV. But in 1998, she and Bruckheimer signed an overall deal with Sony Tri-Star that included television. Midler started to relent, and slowly, slowly (and then, very quickly), she started to entertain the idea of starring in a half-hour comedy.</p>
        <p>''I thought I could set up a movie before committing to a series,'' Midler recalls. ''But it was really a struggle. My husband and I talked about it and he said, 'Turn a corner and be funny.' ''</p>
        <p>Strangely, Midler seems to be frustrated that she's not seen as a dramatic actress. She clearly enjoys being funny, but being relegated to the comedienne category seems to irk her. Throughout her career, Midler has gravitated toward nonhumorous roles, like her character in the sudsy ''Beaches'' or her best part, the lead in ''The Rose, ''the movie based loosely on the life of Janis Joplin. Midler longs for the glamour and the respect of the serious. She seems to view comedy as a sideline, the talent that comes easiest to her.</p>
        <p>At first, Midler thought of suggesting a variety show. But CBS wanted a situation comedy. So last year, in an unusual competition, Columbia Tri-Star Television and Sony commissioned five top TV writers to create situations for Midler. ''We took these pitch meetings,'' Midler recalls, ''and as charming as all those writers were, I kept saying, I can't have an adopted daughter. I can't be a ghost. And I don't want to play a high school principal or a real estate agent. When Jeffrey Lane and I had lunch, he was very dour. He didn't seem happy. But somehow, we got to talking, and he suggested that I play myself. And that was exactly right.''</p>
        <p>Lane, who produced ''Mad About You'' for three seasons (''I don't think Bette ever saw it''), is a shy man who can still, like many people in the Midler orbit, remember standing in line to buy tickets for ''Clams on the Half Shell Revue,'' Midler's Broadway show, in 1975. ''When I met Bette at Spago -- I was too nervous to eat and took my sandwich home -- I said, 'What could be a more interesting character for a television show than Bette Midler?' It was what seemed right, although I knew we'd have to emphasize her family life. She couldn't be too glitzy, but I didn't think that would be a problem, because everybody knows that Bette Midler worked for everything she got. We wanted Bette in real life, with real concerns. On this show, she's a woman who runs a business, and that business is herself. And that's how I think a lot of women see their lives: every day presents its own challenges. Her life and career is all our lives and careers. Bette's experiences are just more heightened.''</p>
        <p>Still nervous about committing to TV, Midler agreed to shoot a pilot in May of this year. The announcement of the CBS fall lineup was scheduled for May 19 at Carnegie Hall in New York. If Midler did not like the finished pilot, she still had veto power, and ''Bette'' would not be added to the lineup. ''That's star power,'' Goldstein says. ''I've never heard of that condition before. We were nervous the whole time.''</p>
        <p>To persuade Midler to put the show on the air, Moonves met with her and Bruckheimer at 21, a restaurant in Manhattan, for drinks. ''I told her she could sing on every episode,'' Moonves recalls. ''I think that's what put her over. In movies, she never gets to sing.''</p>
        <p>When, a few days later, at the announcement of the fall schedule, Midler was brought onstage for the advertisers and press at Carnegie Hall, she received a standing ovation. Midler was stunned. ''That announcement is called an upfront,'' she says now, still sounding incredulous that she's here, on a set, rehearsing her TV show. ''Who knew what an upfront was?'' Midler pauses. ''It was a crazy day,'' she continues. ''I said to Bonnie, 'What do you wear to an upfront?' She said: 'I don't know. What's an upfront?' We were clueless. I wore pants and a sweater. I was upset because I had to cross a picket line to get to Carnegie Hall. I went out onstage, and it was very nice. But then, when I left, my car was gone, and I had to take a cab home. When I got out of the cab, my pants ripped up the back, and my doorman got a good look at my whole tweeter. If that had happened 15 minutes earlier, I would have exposed myself to all those upfronts at Carnegie Hall.''</p>
        <p>The ''Bette'' crew, who are listening, laugh at this story. It sounds like the makings of a future episode. That's how they go: in coming episodes, she's going to get lost on the subway, forget that there are only 30 days in September (she has planned many activities for the 31st) and will decide to act in Shakespeare, because no one respects her skills as a thespian. ''My only concern is that the show be funny,'' Midler says. ''After the first episode, I marched into the writers' room and I said: 'I don't want titters. I want guffaws.' They looked at me and said, 'Yes, Ms. Midler,' and I got my guffaws.''</p>
        <p>Every script is grounded in the backstage- family-versus-onstage-diva conflict. The most vivid interaction on ''Bette'' is between the public and private Bette personas. Those two characters provide nearly all the plot, all the tension, all the show. ''That's the real challenge,'' Midler says, still rehearsing her mime. ''It's a challenge to let the audience in on the joke that is my life. And have it be authentic enough that it's believable, but not so authentic that it's not funny. I've always been very careful in my career to say there are two things going on here, that a lot of this is performance, that it's not the truth. I always wanted to blur the line.''</p>
        <p>A crucial part of Midler's appeal has always been her outsiderness. Onstage, especially, she was the best version of a misfit: a great singer, a great dancer but, most of all, a brilliant observer. Onstage, she was always engaged, enthralled by the sheer thrill of performing. TV Bette is aiming for that scale.</p>
        <p>''This is the me that I wish I was,'' Midler continues. ''I get to wear beautiful clothes. I wear high heels all day long. And I have a really nice bosom line.''</p>
        <p>Andrew Weyman, the director, interrupts her. ''I think it's the you you are,'' he says. Midler pauses a minute. Her mind has clicked back to work mode. She wants to rehearse this scene, to return to TV Bette. ''It's very confusing,'' she says later. ''I just have to be careful not to reveal all my tricks in the first season. Or ever.''</p>
        <p>The first song Bette Midler performed onstage was ''The Lullaby of Broadway.'' She was in sixth grade in Honolulu, Hawaii, where she was born and reared. ''I received a standing ovation,'' she recalls one afternoon, back in New York shortly after taping Episode 3. We are having lunch at an Italian restaurant around the corner from her house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>She moved uptown from TriBeCa a few years ago. ''I missed light,'' she explains. ''Where I go, it must be beautiful.'' Midler is sort of joking, but beauty is one of her major themes. As the founder of the New York Restoration Project, Midler has reinvented parks and other public spaces in Manhattan. In Los Angeles, she helped clean up the freeways under California's adopt-a-highway plan. ''She'll put on her overalls and pick up trash,'' says Shaiman. ''And she'll get you to do it, too.''</p>
        <p>Contrary to her low-cut, risque onstage persona, Midler is easily shocked in her daily life. Like TV Bette, she is a mom, and she's horrified that, thanks to Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, her teenage daughter now knows the intricacies of oral sex. ''I was sheltered,'' she says. ''I didn't even get Elvis Presley until I was 30. He was just . . . sex. And then I understood. But you shouldn't learn everything when you're a kid.''</p>
        <p>She studies the menu. Today Midler is wearing no makeup, and without big hair and freshly scrubbed, she looks girlish. ''In the seventh grade, I was accused of having a superiority complex,'' Midler continues. ''But I told my teacher, Mr. Bryce Omar-Todd, that it was really overcompensation for an inferiority complex. And that's me. I have always been on my own. My mom and my dad, who were children of the Depression and World War II, always said, 'It's best not to count on men.' They never told me I wouldn't get married, but they told me I must learn to be independent, that I must support myself, that I must not think that anyone would support me. Maybe they thought I was so unappealing that I would never get married, but for whatever reason, that was their message: You can only count on yourself. And it took.''</p>
        <p>As a child, Midler began performing at speech and drama festivals. Her mother and her father, who was very conservative, a painter for the Navy, neither encouraged her nor discouraged her. ''I wasn't really smitten with show business until I saw Esther Williams,'' she says now, between spoonfuls of soup. ''Technicolor killed me. You felt like you were in paradise when you saw those pictures.''</p>
        <p>In 1965, after a year at the University of Hawaii, Midler was cast as an extra in ''Hawaii,'' the James Michener epic. For the movie, she moved to Los Angeles and then, when filming was completed, moved to New York City. A year later she was cast in ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' In the early 70's, she went from Sholom Aleichem to the Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse, where she first showcased the Divine Miss M., her alter ego. Midler's Miss M. was devised with the help of Bud Friedman, the owner of the Improv nightclub in New York, who took Midler on a tour of downtown clubs and old albums, which she absorbed spongelike and then used to create her onstage persona. Those shows have become legendary, and the Divine Miss M. persona has provided the foundation for Midler's career. In her shows, she'd revive songs and personalities from decades past -- performers that Friedman introduced her to like Martha Raye, Sophie Tucker, Bessie Smith and, most of all, Mae West, and songs like the Andrews Sisters' ''Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy'' and the Shangri-Las' ''Leader of the Pack.'' The Divine Miss M. was bawdy and insinuating, but never really dirty. ''Bette was funny -- really funny -- and she could sing,'' says Marc Shaiman. ''Her vocal style was, and is, emotional. When she sings, Bette can make a person feel something in one word. That one word can transport you.''</p>
        <p>The combination of outrageous humor and song set her apart from other performers. ''I saw a quality that reminded me very much of Streisand,'' said Johnny Carson, who began booking her regularly on his show in the early 70's. ''There was an empathy, a rapport that was hard to equal.''</p>
        <p>But the extremes of the onstage Bette persona made it difficult to cast her in movies. She was so vivid as this character that it was hard to imagine her as anyone else. In 1979, her manager (and onetime boyfriend), Aaron Russo, persuaded her to play the lead role in ''The Rose.'' ''I resisted it,'' Midler says. ''Janis Joplin had made a big, big impression on me. I completely understood what she was putting out, I recognized it as something -- the frenzy, the speed, the passion -- I had known my whole life. So when they came to me in 1972, I said no. I didn't want to do that to Janis. And I didn't want to do that to me.</p>
        <p>''Finally,'' Midler continues, ''Russo said I had to do the part and I said, well, if I must, I must. It was a great part, and I was not obliged to be funny. 'The Rose' was very close to my own story. I'd lived that life.'' Midler was nominated for an Academy Award for ''The Rose,'' and the movie was a hit, but she now claims that, after her success in ''The Rose,'' she did not receive any other offers to star in films. ''They thought my work in that movie was a fluke,'' she says now, sounding resigned. ''At the time, I was devastated. It was staggering. And it just happened to me again with 'The First Wives Club.' The movie made a hundred million dollars, and the studio couldn't get a sequel together. They thought it was a fluke. At least now my attitude has gotten better. I no longer feel that they are going to take everything away from me. When you build a career, you always worry that they're going to find out that you're a fraud. But now I'm so old, I don't care. Let them take it.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, Midler followed ''The Rose'' with ''Jinxed,'' a sweet movie that received particularly vicious press. Russo was no longer her manager, and her co-star, Ken Wahl, and her director, Don Siegel, savaged Midler in interviews. ''To tell you the truth,'' she says now, weary of the subject, ''I didn't deserve the press I got. But it was a downward spiral after 'Jinxed.' Aaron was gone, and he had always protected me. I really had a bad time of it.''</p>
        <p>In 1986, her movie career was revived by Disney. ''Down and Out in Beverly Hills'' repositioned Midler as a middle-age movie comedienne, and for the next decade she worked exclusively for the Disney studio. ''Bette was Minnie Mouse,'' says Bruckheimer, who was by then her business partner. Bruckheimer was Russo's assistant on ''The Rose'' and, although Midler initially disliked her, they bonded during the editing of the film. ''One day Bette showed up at my house with a Cuisinart,'' Bruckheimer recalls, ''and, since I don't cook, I realized that was her way of cementing the friendship.''</p>
        <p>Midler says: ''Even though I was their favorite girl at Disney, I was never the comic lead in one of their movies. I was always the support. Or the co-girl. I was, at the time, the highest-paid female in town, and I never ever said anything about it because I thought that would be in poor taste. Now I'm ticked off that I didn't say anything. These days, everyone tells their damn salaries, and I never said a word. That's what comes from being a lady.''</p>
        <p>While still at Disney, Bruckheimer and Midler developed ''For the Boys,'' a musical set against the backdrop of World War II, for 20th Century Fox. Although humorous in spots, ''For the Boys'' was serious and appealed to Midler's interest in dramatic parts. ''We spent years on that project,'' Bruckheimer says, still sounding raw, ''and nobody went to see it. That was shocking to me. I thought it was a sure thing. I was catatonic when it failed.'' (The movie did earn Midler her second Oscar nomination.)</p>
        <p>Midler shrugs off the disappointment: ''By the time 'For the Boys' came around, I had been through 'Jinxed' and so many other storms. I had so much armor around me. I had turned into a . . . man.'' Midler laughs. ''And you know how they are. They have no feelings.''</p>
        <p>At her darkest moments in the movie business, Midler has, traditionally, sought solace on the road. ''She goes on tour,'' says Shaiman, ''and her audience is always there.'' In 1993, for instance, she sold a record-breaking $11 million worth of tickets at Radio City Music Hall. She returns, again and again, to the Divine Miss M., her onstage persona. She's safe in that role. ''I've lasted because of the audience for my stage shows,'' Midler says. ''The foundation of my career has been those shows. My audience has never left -- they're very familial. And when I feel I'm getting bitter, I go back on tour. It's always and forever O.K. on the road.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps because her recording career doesn't absorb as much of her time, she isn't conscious of ageism in the music business. Her albums, which are musically eclectic, mixing ballads with traditional Hawaiian songs with glossy show stoppers, do not fit any radio format, and her videos are not in heavy rotation on VH1, but none of this bothers her. Midler's new record, named, like the TV show, ''Bette'' (''Synergy!'' she exclaims), was produced by Don Was, who won a Grammy for producing Bonnie Raitt's ''Nick of Time.'' (Midler herself has won three Grammys, the first in 1973, the most recent in 1989.) Of all her projects, the new album seems to be the most thrilling to her. ''I'm happiest when I'm singing,'' she says. ''And I can always sing. In a funny way, singing gives me a free ride. Music informs everything. Comedy, for instance, is like music. It's all beats, getting the right rhythm.''</p>
        <p>Midler turns less blissful when the subject returns to movies. She has made some mistakes -- she turned down the lead role in ''Misery,'' and despite the fact that ''Sister Act'' was written for her, she turned it down. (It went on to be a hit for Whoopi Goldberg.) After ''The First Wives Club,'' Midler starred in a few films (failures like ''That Old Feeling'' and ''Isn't She Great?'') that disappeared quickly and, when TV beckoned last year, she was fed up and ready for a change.</p>
        <p>''I never wanted to get out of the movie business,'' she says, as the waiter removes her barely eaten soup. ''My way is to find another route. When I'm blocked by people who are not interested, not creative and want to preserve the status quo, I go around them. They see me in a certain way, and they push me aside. That happens everywhere, not just in the movie business. CBS really listens to me. They seem to value what I have to say.</p>
        <p>''My real concern,'' she continues, ''is playing the character. If I don't stand outside myself and watch myself, I'll be O.K. I have to remain unself-conscious, and I'm playing someone like myself. The problem is not so much technical as emotional. There's a lot of scrutiny in television. The medium is so powerful, and I don't really like to be talked about. The scrutiny and the conjecture and the people coming out of the woodwork to say, Oh, she stepped on my foot once. If I can keep this show away from myself, then I can weather it.''</p>
        <p>I point out that if she's playing herself, or someone the audience sees as very close to herself, that might be difficult. ''Oh, I know,'' Midler says. She puts on her rectangular sunglasses, ready to leave the restaurant. ''But what can you do?'' She smiles, ever contradictory. ''I read something the other day that Hemingway said,'' she continues. ''He said, 'The best you can do is last and get your work done.' Well, I've lasted. Now I'd like to get my work done.''</p>
        <p>A Thursday morning in Los Angeles: Day 4 of Episode 3 of the ''Bette'' show. Midler is curled up in an overstuffed chair in her faux living room. Her feet, which are small and beautiful (''My feet are my pride,'' she said earlier. ''I'd like to wear them on my face sometimes'') are tucked to the side. She is on the phone. She is talking to Jack Nicholson.</p>
        <p>Midler is calling Nicholson to ask him to appear on her show tomorrow night. Originally, Lily Tomlin was scheduled to appear -- in an elevator scene with Midler. As written in the script, Tomlin runs into her old friend, TV Bette, outside her psychiatrist's office. Tomlin is in the building to see her nutritionist and sings the praises, to a mute Midler, of an all-legume diet. When they enter the elevator to go downstairs, Tomlin very loudly breaks wind. The entire elevator, including Midler, reacts, and Tomlin breaks the awkwardness by saying, ''Bette!'' Since Midler has lost her voice, she cannot defend herself from this false accusation, and Tomlin continues: ''I'm sorry. . . . She's just . . . Bette.''</p>
        <p>Because of a scheduling conflict, Tomlin cannot make the taping scheduled for the following evening. All week, the coordinating producer of ''Bette,'' Jon Kenney, has had the task of pitching this guest shot to a long list of well-known actors. Jane Seymour immediately said no, and Candice Bergen loved the idea, but she mentioned it to some of her advisers, and they did not embrace the concept. Brooke Shields couldn't do it; she was off to New York to perform in ''The Vagina Monologues.'' ''So I said, 'How about Tom or Nicole or Jack Nicholson,' ''Midler said, before making the call to Nicholson. ''Why not a movie star?''</p>
        <p>Kenney located Nicholson's home number, and Midler phoned. She explained, before dialing: ''I know Jack. I haven't spoken to him in a long time, but here's what I'll say: 'Jack, even if you don't, I hope you'll come on the show anyway.' ''</p>
        <p>Midler seemed to delight in this bit of scatological humor, which was somewhat surprising, given her repeated dislike of overtly scandalous material. She regularly complains about the proliferation of profanity (''Where did you learn those words?''), and she is endlessly disturbed by Bill Clinton's behavior. (''Clinton's an actor,'' Midler says. ''Never trust an actor.'') ''Bette's very proper,'' Marc Shaiman says. ''She'll be shocked by something, and you'll say, What about the time you used this word onstage or you showed that body part on stage. She'll laugh and explain how it was different, how there's a world of distance between then and now.''</p>
        <p>This week, she has repeatedly expressed extreme dismay over the Gucci billboard on Sunset Strip. The ad is a close-up on a man's crotch, and his penis seems to be semi-erect. ''I think it's shocking that they haven't taken it down,'' Midler exclaimed yesterday. ''I mean, I wear Gucci clothes. Or I used to wear Gucci clothes. I'm not going to anymore. That ad is appalling. It imposes a sensibility that most people don't want. Or are just too exhausted to argue with.''</p>
        <p>When I point out that Midler, too, has consistently presented a subversive, albeit less overtly sexual, sensibility, especially in her live shows, she vehemently disagrees. ''It was half of 1 percent of what you see now. And there was room for half of 1 percent. No one thought the entire culture was going to be subsumed by sex. Sex is a spice, an added flavor. It enhances and it's lovely, but it's not the whole recipe. I was risque. And there was a place for risqueness. I crossed some major lines, and I take responsibility for that, but there are certain lines that should never be crossed.''</p>
        <p>Apparently, flatulence on television is not one of them. ''Jack won't do it,'' Midler reports, hanging up the phone. ''He said, 'Well, I don't do TV.' I could just hear that down-your-nose attitude in his voice. And I said, 'Well, Jack, you don't do TV now.' Because even the men in movies aren't sent the same material that they are used to being sent. A lot of them have suffered. It's a young boy's medium now. And some of the bones are thrown at young girls.''</p>
        <p>Midler heads off to discuss a solution to this elevator flatulence problem with Bruckheimer and the other producers. ''I should make this whole thing an episode of the show,'' Midler says. ''In fact, I will. We'll do a whole show of me calling people to come on my show and everyone saying no.''</p>
        <p>On a neighboring sound stage, around 12 hours later Midler, in full hair and makeup, is shooting a scene in a set designed to look like a deli. It has been another long day, and there are four more scenes to shoot tonight. Yesterday, ''Bette'' filmed on location -- first at a makeshift soccer field, where it was broiling hot, and then in the courtyard of an office building, where it was windy and frigid. Every scene involved some small indignity or misfortune: first, TV Bette yelled at a soccer referee (but no words came out) when her daughter was penalized, and second, TV Bette was chased by animal rights activists because she could not voice her position. In this deli scene, TV Bette longs for chicken soup, but cannot make herself understood to the counterman.</p>
        <p>While the first two scenes played well, the deli scene is not funny. Standing on the set, talking to Bruckheimer, Midler looks tired. This is her third straight week of taping, and she has been working longer hours than usual. In addition to the show, she shot CBS promos advertising ''Bette'' on Monday night until 2 a.m. Midler and Shaiman wrote the song for the promos. (''The voice/the smile/the fabulous physique./And now I'm in your bedroom once a week.'') Some of the lyrics had jabs at Regis Philbin and other shows. The four different promos were more like Stage Bette than TV Bette -- she was dressed in evening gowns and was surrounded by a male chorus. They looked more fabulous than comic.</p>
        <p>Initially, CBS approved the ideas for the promos, but then, after viewing them, they chose not to show them. ''They are worried about confusing viewers,'' Midler would say later. ''And I didn't argue. They feel that the audience expects one kind of show, and the promos, which I think are great, look like another.''</p>
        <p>It may also be that the promos could alienate the core female audience. Gaudiness and glamour may work in the movies (and onstage), but familiarity and accessibility are crucial elements on television. The promos for ''Bette'' were just too divine; they lacked the common touch. If her show is to succeed, it has to combine both those elements.</p>
        <p>''I'm exhausted from yesterday,'' Midler says to her longtime hairdresser, Robert Ramos. ''And this scene really needs work.'' They rehearse again. This is the scene: TV Bette walks into a deli, goes to the counter and tries to buy some soup. She is recognized by the clerk, who mocks her, saying: ''She's doing some kind of comedy routine. Everybody hold on for the floor show.'' Unable to order her soup, TV Bette stomps off. ''I once saw Goldie Hawn fall down in Denny's,'' a woman confides, as she exits.</p>
        <p>The crew is tired, and no one except Midler seems to really care that the scene is not working. ''It's painful,'' she says, over and over, watching the monitor. ''This isn't good.'' The stage falls silent. Midler is right, but they'd rather get through the deli bit and move on to the next.</p>
        <p>Midler and the director block out a piece of stage business, and they shoot the scene six more times. After every take, Midler rushes over to the television monitor. ''I don't think so,'' she complains. ''It's not funny.''</p>
        <p>Modifications are suggested: the writers change the last line to, ''I once saw Goldie Hawn fall down at the dentist's,'' and no one likes that any better. Finally, Midler gives in. It's already 10 o'clock, and time is short. They shoot one more take and, although she's still not happy, she agrees to move on to the next scene. ''That was painful,'' she repeats, heading over to Ramos for a curl touch-up. ''Do you know that David Byrne song that goes, 'How did I get here?' That's me. How did I get here?'' Ramos nods. He does not answer.</p>
        <p>In about 10 minutes, Midler is called back to the set. In this next scene, she has to mime her soup request in a Chinese restaurant. As before, the owners recognize her, but again do not understand her order and push her out the door. ''Take your picture and get out,'' they scream, removing Midler's framed autographed photo from their wall. ''Brenda Vaccaro is no longer welcome here.''</p>
        <p>This scene works. The Brenda Vaccaro bit gets a laugh, and the tension on the sound stage dissipates. Part of the reason the scene works is that it is not completely dependent on Midler. The other actors are funny, and the writing is funny, if a bit inside-Hollywood. ''That was good,'' Midler says to Bruckheimer, after watching the scene on the monitor. She goes back and does the bit two more times. When she's finished, Midler looks exhausted. ''This is too much,'' she says, mock-collapsing against Ramos. ''Tell me again, how did I get here?''</p>
        <p>Three days later, Midler and her Jack Russell terrier, Queen Puddles von Haselberg, are boarding the Sony private jet back to New York. Originally her show was supposed to be filmed in New York, but CBS believed that the best writers and the best crews were in Los Angeles, and Midler agreed to shoot in California for the first year of the show, an arrangement that means she sees her husband and daughter every two weeks. In exchange, Sony has allowed Midler use of its corporate jet. ''This is the life,'' she says as Puddles climbs into her lap. ''You could get really used to this.''</p>
        <p>Two nights before, a Friday, Episode 3 of ''Bette'' was filmed. The studio audience began arriving at noon, and at 6 p.m. they were shown the pilot episode, so they knew the basic premise of the show. Before being chosen, each of the audience members, who were culled largely from shopping malls and movie theaters, was asked if he or she was a Bette Midler fan. As a result, the mix was eclectic but wildly enthusiastic. The audience was, perhaps, more heavily female and homosexual than, say, the audience for ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' but there was a mix. They went wild for the pilot, clapping enthusiastically for any campy bits. The extreme, stage-Bette elements played best. The domestic elements seemed to have less allure.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the more outrageous elements of Episode 3 got the loudest laughs. Viewers at home may respond to familial strife, but studio audiences, or this studio audience anyway, was looking for some raunch. They especially loved the flatulence scene, which was now filmed with Midler's psychiatrist embarrassing her in the elevator. ''We'll probably end up cutting that scene,'' says Wendi Goldstein of CBS. ''Without a celebrity, it doesn't really work.''</p>
        <p>Between setups, Midler's crew played show tunes, and when she started singing to ''One'' from ''A Chorus Line,'' the audience erupted. ''I don't even remember doing that,'' Midler says now, putting on her seat belt for takeoff. ''I was overengaged on Friday night. My little feet were going so fast; it was just a blur. I've never been this tired.''</p>
        <p>She pauses a moment. ''I don't know if I regret saying yes to doing this show,'' she continues. ''I know I'm going to do the best work I possibly can. And I think I'm going to have a lot of fun. But the workload is just so overwhelming. I don't want to be a bad sport, but it's hard.''</p>
        <p>Midler strokes Puddles's head. ''When they say this is a dream job, they lie, lie, lie,'' she continues. ''I staggered all week. I was dying. I was dead on my feet. I had no idea. No idea. I've worked hard before, but never this hard. I am dumbstruck.''</p>
        <p>Her complaints of exhaustion seem to energize her. It has become a routine, a sort of comedic riff, another part of the persona. When you have this many characters, and they are all you, your on-screen and off-screen lives kind of meld together. TV Bette was exhausted, too. Or does it go the other way? ''But don't misunderstand,'' Midler says. ''I do love working. I mean, I must. I derive an enormous amount of my sense of self from what I do.'' Or selves.</p>
        <p>Seeing her sitting here on the plane in her jeans and no makeup with a small dog in her lap, Midler is easy to identify with. Her goal is to stay engaged, to work in a business that is increasingly hostile to women who are not young or traditionally beautiful. Her persona is hers alone, and it is her best shot at long-term survival. It is her brand, her trademark. ''I know that's true,'' she says. ''And I'm counting on that. It sounds corny, but this is my calling. I have no choice -- this is what I do.''</p>
