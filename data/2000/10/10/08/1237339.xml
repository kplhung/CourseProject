        <p>TAKE a look at SOME classic films from midcentury and they seem almost cliched, just because they've been imitated so many times, often badly. But Vittorio De Sica's masterpiece THE BICYCLE THIEF (1949) is as fresh and powerful as ever. Lamberto Maggiorani is heartbreaking and yet strangely inspiring as a poverty-weary man who has finally found a job and manages to reclaim his pawned bicycle (a job prerequisite) only to have it stolen on his first day of work. The film, Italian neo-realism at its purest, is a portrait of the man's hope, desperation, determined responsibility and shaky dignity as he and his little boy (Enzo Staiola) search Rome for the missing bike -- Thursday at 8 p.m. on TCM.</p>
        <p>You don't have to be gay to appreciate what THE CELLULOID CLOSET (1996) has to say about depictions of homosexuality in the movies. From a hand-on-his-hip character in ''Algie the Miner,'' a 1912 silent, to Sal Mineo's adoration of James Dean in ''Rebel Without a Cause,'' this is a lovely, often witty, sometimes wistful film. The themes, illustrated by beautifully edited film clips and smart narration (written by Armistead Maupin), include ridicule, disguise, visibility and punishment by death (why does the gay character always get shot or stabbed or crushed by a tree?). The directors, Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, make the message clear and politically pointed, but it's also highly entertaining. Take the exchange between Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, respectively, in ''Some Like It Hot'': ''Why would a guy want to marry a guy?'' ''Security'' -- Friday at 9 p.m. and midnight on Bravo.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time there was a British film factory called Ealing Studios, it specialized in slightly eccentric comedies, and one of the best was Henry Cornelius's PASSPORT TO PIMLICO (1949). Stanley Holloway stars as a Londoner who, in the rubble of an accidental postwar bomb explosion, discovers buried treasure. Margaret Rutherford is heaven as the crusty historian who establishes that this particular little corner of London is, according to an ancient charter never revoked, actually part of Burgundy. The Duke of Burgundy shows up, the neighborhood secedes, and everyone gets wonderfully plucky -- Sunday at 9 p.m. and Friday at midnight on CUNY.</p>
        <p>Need someone to play a wife and mother nobly dying of cancer -- and give a performance that stands out from all the terminally ill screen heroines of the past? Cast Meryl Streep. She gives ONE TRUE THING (1998) -- the story of an ambitious young journalist (Renee Zellweger) pressured to interrupt her career to take care of her sick mother -- an uncompromising, poignant core. William Hurt is Streep's husband, a philandering, egotistical college professor who, for some reason, never considers taking a sabbatical to play caregiver himself. Carl Franklin directed -- Saturday at 10 p.m. on Starz.</p>
        <p>David Duchovny fans love THE RAPTURE (1991) just because it proves Mr. Duchovny had a movie career before ''The X-Files.'' But this intense film, written and directed by Michael Tolkin, would be notable without the power of celebrity. Mimi Rogers plays a seriously wanton woman (group sex with strangers she picks up at bars is a typical evening's entertainment for her) who simply wakes up one morning disgusted with herself and finds God. Mr. Duchovny is the equally dissolute man who soon joins her in religious conversion and a new, remarkably clean-cut life together. Then, for numerous reasons, Ms. Rogers becomes convinced that the Apocalypse is at hand, and her behavior turns truly dangerous -- Sunday/Early Monday at 1:45 a.m. and Thursday at 11:15 p.m. on IFC.</p>
