        <p>With Senator John S. McCain at his side, Representative Rick A. Lazio  declared yesterday that he had a ''complete commitment to campaign finance reform'' and had not breached his agreement with Hillary Rodham Clinton to restrict campaign spending by accepting $1.8 million from Washington Republicans for television advertisements.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McCain, the nation's leading proponent of restricting campaign contributions, stopped short of defending Mr. Lazio's arrangement with the Republican National Committee, which had given him the money.</p>
        <p>During a campaign stop at Hofstra University on Long Island, Mr. McCain said instead that the spending agreement with Mrs. Clinton was ''ambiguous'' and that he was glad that Mr. Lazio had decided to return the money.</p>
        <p>''I think Rick Lazio did the right thing because that would remove any ambiguities, because there are ambiguities in this,'' Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, said at a campaign event that had been arranged before  Mr. Lazio came under fire for broadcasting at least two advertisements paid for by the Republican National Committee.</p>
        <p>''The fact is they are stopped,'' Mr. McCain said of the advertisements. ''They were only on for a few days.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Lazio and Mr. McCain campaigned among veterans on Long Island, Mrs. Clinton appeared with Irish-American leaders in Manhattan, where she moved to take advantage of the ads in question. Her campaign, and a few Republicans, described them yesterday as a serious misstep by Mr. Lazio on the eve of the second debate between the two candidates.</p>
        <p>She denounced the advertisements as ''cynical and really inexplicable and clearly violative of the agreement,'' which prohibited spending on commercials by entities other than the two campaigns.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said she would wait to see if Mr. Lazio actually returned the money before saying whether she would continue to adhere to the pact.</p>
        <p>''It was a very troubling discovery,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''I hope to be able to abide by the agreement, but I'm going to have to study this.</p>
        <p>''I mean, when I heard about it I was dumbfounded that this would have been done -- and done so soon after we reached this agreement that he obviously ballyhooed, went around with John McCain, talking about how great it was that we had reached this agreement,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio asserted again yesterday that he had done nothing wrong. He said both campaigns, in their negotiations on restricting the activities of outside groups, had agreed to an exception that allowed political parties to funnel up to $1.8 million in what is known as ''coordinated spending'' to the campaigns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who had spent $1.4 million of that, said he was transferring an equal amount from his campaign to the Republican National Committee as a repayment.</p>
        <p>''It was something that the people that I had in the meeting that negotiated this are willing to swear in an affidavit that they agreed to,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''It's why character is at the heart of this campaign.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, I was curious then, as I'm curious now, that they did not want to have press in the room,'' Mr. Lazio said of the negotiations in which his final agreement with Mrs. Clinton was reached.</p>
        <p>''Now I know why they didn't. I think it was curious then, as it is curious now, that they didn't want a written agreement that would spell out everything. Now I have a better idea.</p>
        <p>''In my heart, in my campaign's heart, we want to do the right thing on this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton and her advisers denied Mr. Lazio's description of the deal. And Mr. Lazio himself made no mention of the exception in the course of a fairly detailed news conference he gave announcing the deal with Mrs. Clinton two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>At her news conference yesterday, Mrs. Clinton denied a charge by Mr. Lazio's chief strategist, Mike Murphy, that her campaign had known from the start that the Republican Party-financed advertisement was running, and had not objected because her aides had agreed with Mr. Lazio that it was allowed under their deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy said Mrs. Clinton objected only when her campaign was contacted about it by The New York Times, because she saw an opportunity to score political points against her opponent.</p>
        <p>Responding to Mr. Murphy, Mrs. Clinton said, ''You know, the people in my campaign are working very hard and are not glued to TV sets looking at the tiny letters that run on the bottom of our opponent's ads.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad that one of The New York Times's reporters was,'' she continued. ''And that's how we found out about it.''</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton's aides, questioned about her assertion, later acknowledged that some people in the campaign had in fact known about the Republican National Committee's sponsorship of the commercials earlier last week, before an article about them was published in The Times on Friday. Her aides insisted that Mrs. Clinton was not aware of that when she spoke yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Clinton campaign is well known for its so-called war room, where aides, working around the clock, monitor newspapers, television stations and the Internet to track the Lazio campaign.</p>
        <p>The dispute between the two candidates came the day before their second debate, which is to be broadcast at 10:30 this morning from the WCBS-TV studios in Manhattan. It began in their first debate last month, when Mr. Lazio walked across the stage and demanded that Mrs. Clinton sign a document pledging not to use the largely unrestricted campaign contributions known as soft money.</p>
        <p>The advertisement by the Lazio campaign, first broadcast last week, contained a small printed tag line saying, ''Paid for by Lazio 2000/The Republican National Committee.''</p>
        <p>A nearly identical version of the advertisement, which was distributed to newspapers, said only that it was paid for by Lazio 2000.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said she would wait and see whether Mr. Lazio returned the money before deciding on her next step. Asked what kind of proof she needed, the first lady responded, ''A canceled check would be good.''</p>
