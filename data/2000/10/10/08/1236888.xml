        <p>So this week, the world will once again rely on a secretive group of committees in Stockholm to mark the paths from eureka to Viagra, as it were, with Nobel Prizes for as many as nine scientific heroes -- a maximum of three apiece in the fields of chemistry, physics and medicine or physiology. (There are also prizes in literature and peace and economics, of course, but as Burton Feldman writes in his coming ''The Nobel Prize: A History of Genius, Controversy and Prestige,'' they are ''not unlike pale fires, shining more brightly in the reflected light of Einstein and company.'') Erling Norrby, the secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which conducts the final vote for the physics and chemistry prizes, perfectly expresses the underlying Great Man view of science when he says of human creativity: ''That, I believe, is in the individual. Someone has to carry the torch, has the idea, has the vision.''</p>
        <p>How unromantic, then, that as both science and the Nobels reach new heights of influence, the correspondence between them may be unraveling. The reasons for their divergence have to do mostly with the many ways in which science has morphed in the last few decades. Much of the vitality of science is found in computer science and geophysics and behavioral genetics, disciplines that did not exist at the start of the last century. Alfred Nobel intended for his prize money to subsidize a lifetime of research, generally impossible now in an era of billion-dollar experiments. Discoveries in increasingly crowded and competitive fields are almost always photo finishes these days, and determining the winner -- assuming that it really matters -- is often a study in ambiguity. In short, the gloriously personal spirit of the Nobel Prize is dissolving among the Internet connections and plane schedules of the postmodern, decentralized, multinational research enterprise. In 2005 or 2006 the $4 billion Large Hadron Collider, the world's most powerful particle accelerator, will begin its search for the Higgs boson, a bizarre particle that theorists say is the wellspring of all mass in the universe; 3,500 or so physicists and engineers will be involved. When Wilhelm Conrad RRated PG-13ntgen won the first Nobel Prize in physics in 1901 for discovering X-rays in his lab, there were fewer than 250 physicists in Germany and about 1,000 in the entire world.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure that this is a problem,'' says Norrby of ever-larger collaborations; even in this setting he thinks there will be ''the unique individual, a lead pair of individuals to drive this group.'' Historians of science aren't so sure. Spurred by the very existence of teeming research entities, their examination of the origins of scientific discovery suggests that in the present age, discovery almost always unfolds in a fabric of communication and collaboration, heavily influenced by a wider social culture, rather than as the individual flight of inspiration sought by the Nobels.</p>
        <p>If the Nobels were only about subjective recognition and money -- like the Oscars, say -- then of course it would matter a lot less if they created minor heroes and failed to reflect the scientific process. Yet the prizes actually shape that process, even define science. Because they are regarded by those who finance scientific research as validating that support, the awards risk steering money and legitimacy to those projects in which individual authority is easily delineated, whether or not the best science is served. Is it time to change the winning criteria?</p>
        <p>Some scientists argue that changing the Nobels' almost mathematical formula -- Great Discovery + n (Great Scientist) = Prize, where n is an integer less than 4 -- would ruin their mystique altogether. Those defenders of the status quo might reasonably ask how it is that the big collaborations are making important discoveries if the prizes are distorting science. The diplomatic retort is to say the problem is not acute yet because the prizes reflect a long lag time and the research teams have not been nearly as big as they will be. The undiplomatic one points out that some physicists, at least, already believe the focus on boutique-scale science has led to Nobel Prizes for less-than-immortal work in the last several years.</p>
        <p>Peter L. Galison, a historian of science at Harvard, likes to use architectural images when talking about science, and he has one for the Nobel Prizes. ''It's like having a beautiful building with thick walls and wonderful Ionic columns and nice ceiling fixtures'' for your laboratory, he says. ''And yet at a certain point you can't work in that space anymore, as beautiful as it may have been. It was designed for a different age.'' For the intellectual balustrades and cornices of the grand old Nobels, in fact, the very act of memorializing the advance of science may now be calcifying that advance.</p>
