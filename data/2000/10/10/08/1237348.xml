        <p>Democrats who run for office in Utah frequently fail to mention their party affiliation, because Republicans outnumber them better than 2 to 1 and control everything in state (S)</p>

        <p>Democrats almost qualify as an endangered species in Utah, where Republicans outnumber them better than 2 to 1 and control just about everything. So when Democrats run, they often run without identifying themselves as Democrats.</p>
        <p>Now and again it works. But whether it will work in this year's Utah governor's race is unclear.</p>
        <p>Bill Orton, a former Democratic congressman, is taking the no-known-party approach as he tries to unseat the popular Republican incumbent, Michael O. Leavitt. But Mr. Leavitt and his allies keep making a big thing of which presidential candidate Mr. Orton will support on Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>Mr. Orton says they need not ask because he's not going to tell.  ''That's nobody's business,'' he groused to The Salt Lake Tribune the other day. ''Mike Leavitt wants to run against Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leavitt argues that whether a candidate for governor plans to back ''friends and neighbors of Utah'' is a legitimate question. Mr. Leavitt says he will be voting for his good friend George W. Bush.</p>
