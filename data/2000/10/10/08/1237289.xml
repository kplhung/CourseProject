        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign will begin broadcasting this 30-second commercial in upstate New York tomorrow.</p>
        <p>TITLE -- ''Ostrich''</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Team Hillary</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with a shot of an ostrich, meant to represent Representative Rick A. Lazio, standing alone in a desert. With what sounds like a children's song playing, the camera remains on the bird as the narrator speaks about the struggling upstate New York economy. Finally, the ostrich sticks its head into a hole in the sand. Before the close, Mrs. Clinton is shown in two quick scenes, walking with people and then moving down a line, shaking hands.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''Over the last five years, upstate New York has ranked near the bottom of the nation in job growth. And since 1992, 170,000 young people have left. But Rick Lazio doesn't think the area needs targeted economic help. Guess it's hard to find a solution when you can't see the problem. Hillary Clinton. A strong voice for New York families with a detailed plan to create new jobs in upstate New York.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The economy in upstate New York grew much more slowly than in the rest of the nation from 1995 to 1998, but it has improved in the last two years, although growth remains slower than in the New York City area. Mrs. Clinton has advocated tax credits for small businesses that locate in communities with low job growth or high poverty, among other initiatives. Mr. Lazio has said he will help the upstate economy by pushing for its ''fair share'' of federal aid and a broad-based tax cut.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mrs. Clinton pokes fun at her opponent in an area where he is clearly vulnerable. During their first debate, Mr. Lazio said he believed that Mrs. Clinton was trying to portray upstate New York as a ''vast economic wasteland'' when in fact the economy there ''has turned the corner.'' The Buffalo News, in an editorial, has mocked Mr. Lazio's remarks and criticized him for not advocating targeted economic help for the region. The advertisement, which injects a touch of humor in what otherwise has been a largely humorless campaign, could help Mrs. Clinton win votes upstate, a region where Republicans traditionally do well but where polls suggest that Mr. Lazio is lagging.</p>
