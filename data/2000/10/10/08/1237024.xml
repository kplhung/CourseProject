        <p>ALTHOUGH the singer-songwriter John Hiatt has been winning fans with his gritty, thoughtful roots-rock music for 26 years, he is taking a new approach as he tours in support of his new stripped-down acoustic recording, ''Crossing Muddy Waters.''</p>
        <p>The album, brimming with lean blues, folk, country, gospel and roots-rock originals (with the emphasis on roots), might have listeners thinking they have found some long-lost Lightnin' Hopkins recording or that they managed to uncover some historical John Lomax folk archive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hiatt describes the new record as a departure from his more intense rock material of the past.</p>
        <p>''This is definitely a back-porch album,'' said Mr. Hiatt, 48. ''That's where we pictured ourselves while making this album.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hiatt is releasing ''Crossing Muddy Waters'' on both Vanguard Records and Emusic.com, to be sold and digitally downloaded on MP3 format.</p>
        <p>He began this project with his former label, Capitol Records, as a rock recording, but he and Capitol ''just couldn't see eye to eye on the merits of the music.'' So he left the label, deciding to become a free agent.</p>
        <p>His band recorded ''Crossing Muddy Waters'' in four days at a studio outside Nashville, not far from the farm he shares with his wife, children and horses.</p>
        <p>''Doing it this way makes a lot of sense to me,'' he said. ''I'm enjoying my free agency status because there are so many more opportunities to be opened up.''</p>
        <p>These have been good times for Mr. Hiatt, who has seen his share of hard luck. He has had a successful stint as host-interviewer for the PBS music series ''Sessions at West 54th,'' a job he took over from David Byrne.</p>
        <p>Now he has taken to the road, to get back to live performance.</p>
        <p>''There's no replacement for that hour-and-a-half during which I'm allowed to get up there and get out of myself, get out of the trap of my psyche, my worries, my insanity,'' he said. ''Being able to transcend that for 90 minutes is just a wonderful thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hiatt will appear at the McCarter Theater in Princeton at 8 p.m. on Tuesday. Tickets: $27 to $39. Information: (609) 258-6500.</p>
