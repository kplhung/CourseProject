        <p>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have told the Giuliani administration that they have found a pattern of racial profiling by officers on the New York Police Department's Street Crime Unit, which has been under intense scrutiny since the fatal 1999 shooting by four of officers of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors based their conclusions on a statistical analysis of thousands of police searches in the city, which they said showed that blacks and Hispanics were disproportionately singled out, and that the imbalance could not be explained by the fact that the city's minority neighborhoods typically had higher crime rates.</p>

        <p>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have told the Giuliani administration that they have found a pattern of racial profiling by officers on the New York Police Department's Street Crime Unit, which has been under intense scrutiny since the fatal 1999 shooting by four of officers of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors based their conclusions on a statistical analysis of thousands of police searches in the city, which they said showed that blacks and Hispanics were disproportionately singled out, and that the imbalance could not be explained by the fact that the city's minority neighborhoods typically had higher crime rates.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vigorously defended the unit and criticized the Justice Department investigation, saying its methods were flawed and its investigation politically motivated.</p>
