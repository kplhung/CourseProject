        <p>Article describes different 'species' of car parkers in New York City: those who hate moving cars once they have a good alternate-side spot, those who use their cars with wild abandon and others who quickly give up and pull into high-priced garages; drawing; chart (M)</p>

        <p>AS a regular alternate-side parker, Janet MacAdam is likely on any given weekday to be hunkered down in her old Chevy wagon in the middle of the day, reading the daily papers or marking up book galleys as she awaits the end of street sweeping and preserves her claim on the curb.

        <p>AS a regular alternate-side parker, Janet MacAdam is likely on any given weekday to be hunkered down in her old Chevy wagon in the middle of the day, reading the daily papers or marking up book galleys as she awaits the end of street sweeping and preserves her claim on the curb. She is half of a somewhat bohemian couple, a chef and a writer, and they are the sort of veteran West Siders for whom paid parking is anathema.</p>
        <p>But just how invested they were didn't become evident until Ms. MacAdam casually mentioned that whenever they leave their farm in upstate New York to return to the city, they do so early enough in the morning to be back by 1 p.m., in time to find a space before street sweeping and double-parking end at 2.</p>
        <p>''You go down at 1:30, you're out of luck,'' Ms. MacAdam explained. ''If you do it right, you only have to do it on Mondays and Fridays.''</p>
        <p>The problem is that once she finds a good space, she is loath to give it up, whereas her husband likes to use their car to tool around the city. ''The biggest arguments my husband and I ever have is when he'll say he wants to drive downtown to visit a friend on Eighth Street,'' she said. ''I'll say, 'You're not moving that car when it took me hours to find a space!' ''</p>
        <p>If Ms. MacAdam is the nester and her husband the adventurer in their domestic parking rites, you could say that Sandy Marcus is the hunter while her husband, Charles Zimmerman, is the hoarder-gatherer. They are parking foils. not unlike those couples -- all too common in the city -- in which one partner will cruise endlessly in search of a space while the other will happily pull into a garage after a few minutes of fruitless searching.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marcus, a speech pathologist who teaches in the South Bronx, is a self-described Type A predator when it comes to finding on-street parking at the end of a long day. ''I go through red lights if I see another car looking for a spot and think it's going to make a turn before me,'' she admitted. Her artist husband would rather not deal with parking at all; he's just too impatient, she said. Sometimes, though, when Ms. Marcus has parked her car but finds a better space nearby, she will have Mr. Zimmerman stand in front of it and hold it for her until she can repark their silver 1984 Nissan Maxima.</p>
        <p>Does she feel this is ethical?</p>
        <p>''Yeah, I do,'' she said. ''Because I saw the spot, so just like in two seconds I'd be there. I don't think I'd do that if it was three blocks away, but if it's just on the other side of the street and I can be there in two seconds. . . .''</p>
        <p>Neuroses are not uncommon in New York, and especially when it comes to parallel parking, a life skill so fraught with angst and comedy it was destined to inspire a dream sequence in at least one Woody Allen movie. (Remember ''Bananas,'' in which two competing crucifixion processions dissolve into a brawl over a place to park their crosses?) The distinctive parking styles of New Yorkers stand out in especially high relief in a day when there are fewer places than ever to negotiate for, as the growing number of cars in the city and static number of parking spaces indicate.</p>
        <p>''Traffic has been growing generally about 2 or 3 percent a year, and you can just conclude that those cars need some place to park,'' said Elliot G. Sander, the former city transportation commissioner, now a private consultant and director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University.</p>
        <p>Samuel I. Schwartz, the former deputy city transportation commissioner-turned-consultant, whose many hats include that of Gridlock Sam, the traffic columnist for The Daily News, concurs. ''It's harder and harder to find spots,'' he said, ''and you have to be more and more creative.''</p>
        <p>Although the consensus among several experts on transportation in the city is that the strong economy has made parking tougher than ever, Deputy Transportation Commissioner Michael Primeggia disagreed. Mr. Primeggia said that more on-street parking was available, thanks to new, multispace meters the city had installed in critical shopping districts, along with relaxed alternate-side parking regulations.</p>
        <p>He also noted that not every car entering the city needs short-term parking and that not every part of the city was equally saturated. ''In our neighborhood in Brooklyn, my wife and I manage to find parking every day for two cars and we don't change our life around to do it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even as the debate continues, several advocates of public transportation say the time has come for all city parking to be of the paid variety, even if that means installing meters on every block and charging by the minute in loading zones.</p>
        <p>''The answer to this is called congestion pricing,'' said John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a nonprofit watchdog group. ''Capitalism says that when there's a shortage of something, prices go up.''</p>
        <p>How that idea would go over with parkers like Ms. MacAdam and Ms. Marcus is predictable enough. Besides, Ms. MacAdam said, on a few desperate occasions lately, she has even had trouble finding paid space in local garages.</p>
        <p>IT helps to be a dare-ya kind of driver like Eric Greenberg, a high school history teacher who commutes daily from Manhattan to East Meadow, on Long Island. Mr. Greenberg boasts that he can nudge his way into spaces even shorter than his silver Ford Taurus station wagon.</p>
        <p>''If I see a space that's two inches bigger than my car,'' he said, ''I barely consider it a challenge.''</p>
        <p>''One macho thing a lot of people do is wait behind someone trying to get into a tight spot,'' he added. ''You put them under pressure. You just wait behind them; few will try more than twice to fit in. I particularly get a lot of satisfaction from a person with a subcompact who can't get into a spot and I know I can get into it with my station wagon.''</p>
        <p>Like many city parkers, Mr. Greenberg looks not only for open spaces but for people with keys in hand, hopefully on their way to move their car. Others take this strategy a step further, enlisting strangers in their quest for a parking space.</p>
        <p>''You have to beg them,'' said Ms. Marcus, who uses this approach. '' 'Please do me a favor and don't leave your spot till you see my car coming!' ''</p>
        <p>Luckily, Ms. Marcus has never met Sandy Carp, a high school guidance counselor from Kew Gardens, Queens, who has little tolerance for such guerrilla maneuvers. Ms. Carp said she had twice encountered people physically blocking parking spaces near her home. In the more recent incident, she returned about 10:30 p.m. to find three generations -- a father, a grandfather and a young child -- standing in a parking space they were saving for an unseen relative.</p>
        <p>''They're all lined up, the three of them, and I said, 'Excuse me, I'm going to get into this space,' and they said, 'No, you can't,' '' Ms. Carp recalled. ''And I said, 'You really aren't allowed to save the space.' There was no car in sight. And the old man said, 'Who's going to make me?'</p>
        <p>''This time, I had a cell phone, and I said, 'Well, the police will make you.' So as I'm trying to dial they sort of all drift off somewhere.''</p>
