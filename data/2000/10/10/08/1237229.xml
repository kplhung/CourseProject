        <p>A 22-year-old immigrant from El Salvador was convicted last week of murder and arson for setting a fire that killed four people in an illegally converted and overcrowded apartment house in Huntington Station in May 1999.</p>
        <p>After a three-week trial and one day's deliberation, a Suffolk County jury in Riverhead found the defendant, Jose Umanzor, guilty of eight counts of murder -- four counts of depraved indifference and four counts of felony murder -- and one count of arson. He faces a maximum of 25 years to life in prison when he is sentenced at the end of the month.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said that Mr. Umanzor, who had been working as a mechanic in a brake manufacturing plant, poured gasoline on the stairwell leading up to the second floor of a two-story house in Huntington Station in the early morning hours of May 1, 1999. They argued that Mr. Umanzor set the fire in the house that he shared with 34 other Salvadoran immigrants in the hope of winning back the friendship of a second-floor tenant, Hector Vasquez. Prosecutors said the two men had quarreled and Mr. Umanzor thought he would regain the respect of Mr. Vasquez by saving him from the fire.</p>
        <p>But the fire quickly raced out of control and engulfed the house, which had been illegally converted from a commercial property into five apartments. The fire killed Maria Chicas, her five-year-old daughter, Maria, Hubense Flores and Luis Cruz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Umanzor gave police investigators written and videotaped confessions to the crime and prosecutors said that he suffered burns to his hands and face that he likely received when he set the fire. But Mr. Umanzor's lawyer argued that his client received the burns when he tried to rescue other tenants from the fire and said the confessions had been coerced.</p>
