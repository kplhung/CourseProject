        <p>The Little Tragedies</p>
        <p>By Alexander Pushkin.</p>
        <p>Yale University, cloth, $26; paper, $13.</p>
        <p>Alexander Pushkin's ''Little Tragedies'' are dramas by default. Written in verse during a creatively fecund period in 1830, these four compressed plays, which have been out of print in English in recent years, were perhaps never intended to be produced by a commercial theater. They lack appropriate stage direction as well as explicit musical direction, despite the fact that in three of the plays actors must perform music. In her introduction, the translator, Nancy K. Anderson, suggests that Pushkin intended the plays to be the equivalent of chamber music, performed before small audiences. Because Pushkin chose to write his plays in verse, a modern reader can approach them more as poetry than drama. Unlike the romanticism of ''Eugene Onegin,'' these four narratives often resemble the short morality plays of the Middle Ages. All four plays end abruptly, and an aftertaste of melodrama lingers. Anderson's critical essays flesh out the plays' cultural contexts but lack insights that might mitigate their hurried plot lines and sudden resolutions. Perhaps these problems would have been served by Pushkin's natural lyricism had Anderson let it shape her translation, which is more impressionistic than faithful to the author's vernacular.</p>
