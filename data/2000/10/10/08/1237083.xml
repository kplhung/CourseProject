        <p>Meagan Mary McInerney, a daughter of Maureen and John McInerney of Rockaway, N.J., was married yesterday to Daniel George Johnson, a son of Margaret and Robert Johnson of Wallingford, Conn. The Rev. George Drury performed the ceremony at the Roman Catholic Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in New York.</p>
        <p>The bride and the bridegroom, both 28, graduated from Georgetown University, where they met.</p>
        <p>The bride is a marketing manager at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where she oversees membership acquisition programs. Her mother is a registered nurse in the outpatient pacemaker clinic at St. Clare's Hospital in Denville, N.J. Her father is a senior vice president and associate general counsel at Salomon Smith Barney, the New York investment firm.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, who received a law degree from the University of Virginia, is an associate in the trusts and estates department at Cummings &amp; Lockwood, a law firm in Stamford, Conn. His mother, who is retired, taught the fifth grade at the St. Mary School in Meriden, Conn. His father, also retired, was the supervisor of probation services for the juvenile court in New Haven.</p>
        <p>Ms. McInerney and Mr. Johnson have traveled in the same circles since 1992, both at school and after graduation. They had dined together with friends, attended parties together and watched television together for five years before they exchanged their first kiss.</p>
        <p>The events leading to that kiss were largely a matter of happenstance.</p>
        <p>Beginning in the summer of 1996, their clique of eight or so friends had discussed going to Ireland together. Mr. Johnson decided a good time to go would be after the bar exam and before he started a job at a law firm. By the spring of 1997, the plans became more concrete, but by then only four of the group had committed. And by the time the jet took off from Newark International Airport for the 16-day trip, only Mr. Johnson, his cousin and Ms. McInerney were on board.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, the cousin, Bridget Burke, planned to spend only four days of her journey in Ireland, leaving the two alone for the balance.</p>
        <p>''We were not best friends, and I felt a bit weird about going,'' Ms. McInerney said. ''I didn't know how we'd get along alone for almost two weeks.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, she and Mr. Johnson found they were having a wonderful time exploring the Irish countryside in their tiny rental car, and staying in charming bed-and-breakfasts. But there was no romance. Not a wink. Not a furtive glance. Not a sly smile. Not a covert touch.</p>
        <p>They returned to Newark, said their casual goodbyes and went their separate ways.</p>
        <p>''It was strange to go back to family and friends and tell them that your perception of this person had changed so much,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''It's strange how you can go from hardly talking to someone to becoming a close friend.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McInerney also found herself thinking about how during the trip the timbre of their relationship appeared to have changed.</p>
        <p>''I was thinking how I really wanted to see him again,'' she remembered. ''I felt sure he felt the same, but because nothing had been said, I was not 100 percent sure.''</p>
        <p>A week, then two, went by without a call. ''Before we went, it wouldn't have been normal for me to call and say, 'What's up?' '' Ms. McInerney said.</p>
        <p>Finally, the weekend after Labor Day, Mr. Johnson broke the silence.</p>
        <p>When she picked up the phone and heard his voice, Ms. McInerney recalled saying, ''I was just about to call you!''</p>
