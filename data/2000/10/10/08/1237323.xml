        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Children as well as parents find themselves in a dilemma because of the Boy Scouts of America's anti-gay policy (''Scouting Debate Leaves Children Caught in Middle,'' news article, Oct. 1). Sadly, this is not just a hypothetical problem, because the policy hurts all young people.</p>
        <p>Having won the right to discriminate, the Boy Scouts teach children that discrimination is acceptable. Even worse, the organization stigmatizes gay youth, who already face widespread harassment and hostility and would benefit from the kind of supportive and welcoming environment the Boy Scouts can provide.</p>

        <p>Children as well as parents find themselves in a dilemma because of the Boy Scouts of America's anti-gay policy (''Scouting Debate Leaves Children Caught in Middle,'' news article, Oct. 1). Sadly, this is not just a hypothetical problem, because the policy hurts all young people.</p>
        <p>Having won the right to discriminate, the Boy Scouts teach children that discrimination is acceptable. Even worse, the organization stigmatizes gay youth, who already face widespread harassment and hostility and would benefit from the kind of supportive and welcoming environment the Boy Scouts can provide.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there are alternatives, as many youth programs do not discriminate, including the National 4-H, Campfire Boys and Girls, Boys and Girls Clubs, the Y.M.C.A. and the Girl Scouts. It is my hope that the Boy Scouts will soon join that list.</p>
