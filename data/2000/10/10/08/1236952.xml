        <p>Two gewurztraminers from one winery in one vintage is somewhat unusual on Long Island. Tom Drozd, the winemaker at Palmer Vineyards in Aquebogue on the North Fork, successfully undertook such an experiment a year ago.</p>
        <p>His wines would be recognizable to producers in the Pfalz region of Germany who in a single harvest make various styles of gewurztraminer wine by picking several times as fruit ripening progresses.</p>
        <p>Palmer's normally ripened gewurztraminer grapes, picked Oct. 19, 1999, contained 0.25 percent sugar, a tiny amount. An acre picked Nov. 16, which had been affected by Botrytis cinerea, a mold that concentrates flavors and imparts its own, contained 11 percent sugar. (The same mold creates Sauternes.)</p>
        <p>Separate approaches to wine making yielded very different products: a standard, pale, bone-dry Alsace-style (750-milliliter, $15) gewurztraminer and a golden, syrupy (375-milliliter, $30) dessert version called Select Harvest that resembles a German trockenbeerenauslese.</p>
        <p>The crisp, pungent, dry gewurz (the root word means spicy), a solid, mouth-filling white with a long finish, displays a typical litchi flavor along with a normal, pleasingly bitter finish that may appeal to certain beer mavens.</p>
        <p>Palmer's label occupies plausible, conventional ground when recommending that this wine be used with ''curried or highly seasoned foods,'' but perhaps risky ground when suggesting it as an aperitif; novices, unaccustomed to gewurztraminer's rich, assertive, concentrated punch, might be taken aback.</p>
        <p>Gewurztraminers range from blowzy through restrained. Mr. Drozd wisely avoided grandstanding with both, especially the Select Harvest, which, though unmistakably sweetish, plays out on a dryish side, especially in its lingering finale. Litchi is present, but the flavors are emphatically apricot and peach.</p>
        <p>To enjoy the fullest expressions of these siblings -- to get the biggest bang for your buck -- drink them only lightly chilled, even near-warm. Iciness emphasizes acidity in an offputting way.</p>
