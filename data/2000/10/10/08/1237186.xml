        <p>DESPERATE to halt the sudden wave of bloodshed threatening Middle East peace efforts, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright theatrically ran after Yasir Arafat last week as he stalked out of negotiations in Paris, and ordered the gates closed so the Palestinian leader could not get away.</p>
        <p>The underlying assumption -- shared by Israeli officials who accused Mr. Arafat of ''orchestrating'' the violence -- was that he had the power to swiftly turn off the confrontations like a faucet.</p>
        <p>He is, as one diplomat put it, ''the only address in town.''</p>
        <p>Still, the breakdown of a series of pullbacks and ceasefire agreements between Israeli and Palestinian security officials  last week left it far from clear that Mr. Arafat had this power.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the violence seemed to have a life of its own, with each Palestinian funeral generating a crowd of angry young men marching on an Israeli Army strongpoint with rocks and, sometimes, guns. Even when the Israeli and Palestinian police worked closely together on Friday to prevent a bloodbath at Al Aksa Mosque, youths broke loose, throwing stones and setting fire to an Israeli police post.</p>
        <p>Pinning Mr. Arafat down is not easy, a long series of American and Arab negotiators could wearily testify. He is a master of ambiguity, owner of a remarkable skill that has enabled him, time after time, to wriggle out of defeats and somehow make survival a victory. It was at his weakest point -- when he had become a virtual pariah in the Arab world for his support of Iraq in the Gulf war -- that he achieved his greatest triumph, the Oslo accords, pointing toward the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>Ambiguity, however, is not a strength when decisions must be made.</p>
        <p>Negotiations toward a final peace settlement at Camp David last summer broke down over the emotion-charged issue of Jerusalem and control over the place in the Old City that is sacred to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif. The peace talks that started in Oslo had put off those questions for seven years, but now the negotiators sought to begin defining formal arrangements for its future -- and failed.</p>
        <p>It was at the contested holy site that the new round of violence began after a visit from the hawkish right wing Israeli leader Ariel Sharon -- a man hated by Palestinians for his role in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon and for his Christian militia allies' massacre of hundreds of Palestinian women and children at two refugee camps there.</p>
        <p>The symbolism of Jerusalem has, in a sense, trapped both Mr. Arafat and Prime Minister Ehud Barak.</p>
        <p>On Mr. Barak's side, it is notable that there has been little public criticism of Mr. Sharon's provocative foray. Few Israelis dared challenge Mr. Sharon's assertion of a Jew's right to visit the Temple Mount. This, despite the widespread interpretation that he timed his visit as a ploy to steal the spotlight from his rival for Likud leadership, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had just been cleared to return to politics because prosecutors decided not to press corruption charges. (Strictly speaking, observant Jews are not supposed to walk on the area atop the Mount that contains the Muslim sites, as Mr. Sharon did, because of a religious ruling that they might accidentally step on the Holy of Holies, where Second Temple priests were ritually purified.)</p>
        <p>For Mr. Arafat, the site is an equally sensitive issue. It is the third holiest in Islam, containing the Dome of the Rock shrine and Al Aksa Mosque, and its symbolism figures heavily in the many political rivalries he must contend with. And if Mr. Barak's problems with his crumbling parliamentary coalition are well known, the Palestinian leader also faces growing political challenges from within his constituency.</p>
        <p>''Arafat's authority has eroded over the years,'' said a Western expert on the region who has dealt closely with him. ''There is a tremendous frustration among Palestinians, a lot of very angry people out there, an awful lot of rage. He negotiated these agreements with the Israelis, and Palestinians just don't believe in them anymore.''</p>
        <p>''It's been seven years. The perception among Palestinians is that the Israelis want to drag the process out, to build new settlements, expand existing ones, that Israel still controls their lives,'' he said. ''And there is wide-scale dissatisfaction with the Palestinian Authority, charges of corruption, the heavy-handedness of the P.A. police. All this has hurt Arafat's standing among Palestinians and lessened his influence on the street.''</p>
        <p>The balancing act between factions that sustained Mr. Arafat in exile is more difficult now. Most immediately, his leadership is challenged by Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist organization that has strong roots in Gaza -- the scene of continuous clashes last week -- and for whom the holy site is a perfect issue. In addition, there have long been tensions between the Palestinian leadership that grew up under Israeli occupation during the intifada a decade ago and the circle of officials that Mr. Arafat brought back with him in 1993 from exile in Tunis.</p>
        <p>Indeed, there are signs that the Tanzim (Organization), a grouping of street youths similar to the rock throwers of the intifada, nominally under the banner of Mr. Arafat's Fatah party, are not under his direct control. Marwan Barghouti, an indigenous West Bank Palestinian leader in Fatah who has been leading Tanzim protests in Ramallah, for example, is said to have been at odds with Mr. Arafat over several issues, including democratization.</p>
        <p>''There's a misconception about how Arafat rules,'' said the Western expert who is familiar with him. ''He's not an authoritarian figure like Saddam Hussein. He's always operated on trying to build a consensus. That's part of the problem. In the mid-90's he was trying to co-opt Hamas, but they had a different agenda: to wreck the peace process.''</p>
        <p>Throughout the peace negotiations, Israeli officials have tried to make Mr. Arafat's ability to pacify organizations like Hamas a kind of litmus test of his seriousness about pursuing peace, and early on they criticized him especially for seeking consensus rather than control over the violent groups. For the Israeli politicians and their constituents, after all, the critical issue was not whether Mr. Arafat could maneuver and survive, but whether he could deliver security for Israelis.</p>
        <p>Meron Benvenisti, an Israeli who has done landmark studies of conditions in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem and has long been critical of his government's policies, takes sharp exception to the view that Mr. Arafat was in control of events last week. ''I think this is a typical approach of Israeli Orientalists -- so-called Arab experts -- who would like to make everything appear rational, to seem like a chess game,'' he said by telephone from Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Muhammad Ibrahim, a 17-year-old member of Tanzim in Bethlehem, had a similar assessment as he and his friends gathered to throw stones at an Israeli Army checkpoint. ''The Israelis think that Arafat controls us like puppets,'' he said. ''But we are a force on our own.''</p>
