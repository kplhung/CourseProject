        <p>Dr. Catherine Fiona Lewis and Dean Corning Hamilton were married yesterday by the Rev. Matthew H. Calkin, an Episcopal priest, at the Christ and Holy Trinity Church in Westport, Conn.</p>
        <p>The bride, 37, is a forensic psychiatrist based in Farmington, Conn., where she specializes in intrafamilial homicide. She is also an assistant professor and the director of the law and psychiatry curriculum at the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington. She graduated summa cum laude from Yale University, from which she also received a medical degree cum laude. Dr. Lewis, who is keeping her name, is the daughter of Charles E. Lewis of Boca Raton, Fla., and the late Dorothy Lewis, and the stepdaughter of Christine Lewis.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 42, is the manager of marketing communications for ATMI, a company in Danbury, Conn., that manufactures materials to make semiconductors. He graduated from Cornell University and received an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago. He is a son of Edith J. Hamilton of New Canaan, Conn., and Allan C. Hamilton of Durango, Colo.</p>
        <p>It wasn't a starry night, a sonnet by Shakespeare or a fine restaurant that brought the couple together; it was a lecture called ''The Psychopharmacology of Aggression,'' given by Dr. Lewis in March of last year in Maine.</p>
        <p>''I give talks nationally on how to manage very aggressive patients,'' Dr. Lewis said. ''It was a long, lonely, rainy drive from my home in Farmington, Conn., to Freeport, Me. I kept asking myself, 'Why am I doing this alone on a Friday night?' ''</p>
        <p>After Dr. Lewis's talk, a married couple, Karen Boudreau and Dr. Thomas Jensen, approached her and startled her by asking offbeat personal questions.</p>
        <p>''Do you like people who pun?'' one asked. ''If you were on a date, what would you do with a man who kept on punning?'' the other asked.</p>
        <p>When Dr. Lewis replied, ''I would let him pun for a while, and then analyze why he was trying to distance me,'' the couple shouted, ''We know the perfect man for you!''</p>
        <p>The couple were longtime friends of Mr. Hamilton's and were on a mission to find for him, in the bridegroom's words, ''an attractive, intelligent, unattached woman.''</p>
        <p>''They had been on the lookout for years, and had failed miserably,'' Mr. Hamilton said. Sensing potential, the couple asked Dr. Lewis for her e-mail address.</p>
        <p>But before she would give that up, she had her own set of questions. She said:</p>
        <p>''I asked: Had he ever been arrested? Did he have kids? Did he have kids he didn't know about? Was he employed? And what did he think about work?'' Not long after the lecture, Dr. Lewis and Mr. Hamilton began an e-mail correspondence full of puns -- ''weird, funny stories about cats,'' Dr. Lewis said -- and pictures of meerkats (the African mongoose is her favorite animal).</p>
        <p>One day, the phone in her office rang. ''There was a man with a really nice voice on the other end,'' but he did not identify himself, she said. He simply began talking as if he were continuing an earlier conversation.</p>
        <p>''In the back of my mind I kept thinking: 'I hope it is who I think it is,' '' Dr. Lewis remembered. Finally, after talking on the phone for about 20 minutes, she said, ''I hope this is Dean Hamilton.'' It was, and he invited her to dinner at a Mexican restaurant.</p>
        <p>''I had enjoyed our interactions on e-mail for so long,'' she said. ''It was weird to hear his voice.''</p>
