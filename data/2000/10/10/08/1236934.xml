        <p>David Koch letter corrects September 10 travel article which mentioned that 'A' is last letter of Norwegian alphabet; editors respond (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor: It's a charming, and certainly appealingly counterintuitive, notion that the letter ''A'' does double duty as the name of a town, as well as serving as ''the last letter of the Norwegian alphabet'' (''In Norway, Cod, Caves and White Nights,'' Sept. 10). Unfortunately, that's not the case. As in most Western European languages, ''A'' is the first letter of the alphabet; the last letter is an A with a small circle over it (pronounced AW).</p>

        <p>Norwegian has three additional letters in addition to our 26: the ligature AE, O with a forward slash through it, and the A with the circle on top. That Norwegian or Czech or Hungarian aren't the most common of languages shouldn't mean we simply ignore their uniqueness.</p>

        <p>The editors respond: The Times's style manual calls for accent marks in the Romance languages and German only -- the languages most widely known to American writers and readers, for which the news paper's typesetting systems are best equipped.</p>
