        <p>Peconic Health Corporation and three member hospitals serving the East End of Long Island signed an agreement last week to become affiliates of North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, the largest health system on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Thomas B. Doolan, president and chief executive officer of Peconic, said the hospitals would remain independent, but would benefit from financial and patient services the North Shore-L.I.J. system provided.</p>
        <p>The affiliation expands the sphere of influence of the larger system eastward to the towns of Riverhead, Southold, Southampton, East Hampton and Shelter Island. The Peconic members, Southampton Hospital, Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport and Central Suffolk Hospital in Riverhead, have 402 beds and 1,400 employees, and are served by more than 300 doctors.</p>
        <p>The three hospitals had previously considered a sponsorship arrangement with North Shore-L.I.J. that would have bound the three hospitals even more closely to the larger system, he said. Both arrangements are more limited than mergers that have become common in recent years.</p>
