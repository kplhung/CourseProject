        <p>MODERN comedy, in the parlance of media cognoscenti, is wet: fast, verbal, canny and rude about the human condition. It has side-splitting laughter as its goal. Think of your favorite Mel Brooks movie. Modern comedy helps you accept your humanity.</p>
        <p>Postmodern comedy is dry: more associative and intellectual, more about sublime juxtapositions of character and culture. It is as happy with the knowing grin, the amused, appreciative shake of the head, as it is with laughter. Think of that great episode of ''Seinfeld'' in which an immuno-deficient boy in a bubble, embargoed Cuban cigars and letters John Cheever wrote to a lover were all key ingredients of the story. Postmodern comedy makes you happy you read a newspaper.</p>

        <p>MODERN comedy, in the parlance of media cognoscenti, is wet: fast, verbal, canny and rude about the human condition. It has side-splitting laughter as its goal. Think of your favorite Mel Brooks movie. Modern comedy helps you accept your humanity.</p>
        <p>Postmodern comedy is dry: more associative and intellectual, more about sublime juxtapositions of character and culture. It is as happy with the knowing grin, the amused, appreciative shake of the head, as it is with laughter. Think of that great episode of ''Seinfeld'' in which an immuno-deficient boy in a bubble, embargoed Cuban cigars and letters John Cheever wrote to a lover were all key ingredients of the story. Postmodern comedy makes you happy you read a newspaper.</p>
        <p>Current comedy -- post-comedy comedy -- is neither wet nor dry; it's theoretical. Its goal is less to provoke laughter than to elicit an amusing shock. Interested minimally, if at all, in the human condition or in character, it's all about the goof, the meta-joke, the outrageous ''Wouldn't it be funny if . . .?'' idea. Much post-comedy comedy deals with the blunt introduction of anti-social acts into routine public situations. Think of the latest Farrelly brothers movie, ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' which is mostly a series of blackouts in which some taboo is broken; in one scene Jim Carrey defecates on a neighbor's lawn. Or think of Doodie.com, a much-attended Web site that features 15-second cartoons in which simple animated figures defecate. Or think of the new MTV series ''Jackass.''</p>
        <p>In an era when many show titles are bland and interchangeable (if not virtually identical: how did we end up with ''The Trouble With Normal,''  ''Normal, Ohio'' and ''Norm'' all in the same year?), ''Jackass,'' which had its premiere last Sunday at 9 p.m., is perhaps the most perfectly named program on the air. It makes a title like ''The Drew Carey Show'' seem vague and offhand.</p>
        <p>''Jackass'' is a show that consists of people, principally the host, Johnny Knoxville, performing a variety of painful, dangerous, odious and in many ways hostile stunts and pranks. For example, in a segment from the opening episode that is certain to be much chewed over, Mr. Knoxville enters a porta-potty, one we know has been used, and ties himself to the walls. A garbage truck is then used to turn the toilet upside down, ensuring that the contents pour all over Mr. Knoxville. The camera placidly records the moment and its consequences, one of which is Mr. Knoxville, naked,  scrubbing down in a car wash, an image that calls to mind nothing so much as a refugee-camp delousing. In another segment, Mr. Knoxville allows himself to be pepper-sprayed, hit with a stun gun and shot with a Taser. We watch him drop and writhe in agony.</p>
        <p>Less physically abusive is the segment in which Mr. Knoxville puts a rubber penis in his pants and proceeds to traverse the highways and byways of greater Los Angeles in a happy-go-lucky way, and in what appears to be a tumescent state. In another scene that seeks a reaction from the public, Mr. Knoxville, wearing handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit that has the name of the county jail stenciled on it, blithely enters a hardware store and asks to buy a hacksaw. This is similar to the scene in which Mr. Knoxville, driving a big car, asks a pedestrian for directions, even as a loud thumping can be heard from the trunk. While the distracted pedestrian explains the way, the trunk pops open and a bound and gagged man, naked except for what appears to be a leather thong, jumps out and runs down the street emitting a muffled shriek. In scenes less richly imagined, an obese person spills out of a wheelchair after a collision and a bicyclist apparently riding with a baby in a baby seat (actually a doll) tumbles spectacularly after hitting a curb.</p>
        <p>In a number of these segments, bystanders are sucked into the show. Their reactions don't make you laugh, and they are almost never illuminating. Often the people are just alarmed -- appropriately frightened for the welfare of the cyclist and the baby, worried about the person in the wheelchair, horrified at the sight of a captive escaping some depravity. The hardware store owner discreetly closes his shop and summons the police.</p>
        <p>IN the classic prank show ''Candid Camera,'' people's varied reactions to the considerably milder pranks were the funny thing. In ''Jackass,'' the sight of people's blood pressure skyrocketing is completely predictable. The humor is all in the conception; there's actually no humor in the realization. It's important to note that Allen Funt and company pulled their pranks on a number of people, and almost scientifically collected a variety of reactions. The ''Jackass'' crew usually stops at one, eliminating the possibility of finding, on the sixth visit to a hardware store, that service-minded clerk who would help pick out a good hacksaw. True, in the tumescence episode Mr. Knoxville parades himself through a range of situations. In a surprising number, people are either oblivious or very, very cool.</p>
        <p>''Jackass'' is buoyed by the presence of Mr. Knoxville, whose confident breeziness helps him sail through the segments. Mr. Knoxville, 29, is from Knoxville, Tenn. (He says that his real name is P. J. Clapp, and sticks to it even when an interviewer expresses some dubiety.) He says that his penchant for pranks is his birthright. ''My father was a big prankster,'' he avers by cell phone from a parking lot in Los Angeles. ''He had a tire company in the tough area of Knoxville. He had a lot of tough guys working for him: Big George, Big Sam, Boxcar, whose real name was Woodrow Wilson Boxcar Johnson Jr. And my father would pull pranks. He staged a gunfight at the Christmas party, gave Ex-Lax milkshakes to the men, sent letters supposedly from a V.D. clinic to his friends, telling them they had been exposed.''</p>
        <p>It's not surprising to hear that Mr. Knoxville has been getting acting assignments (he had a part in the movie ''Coyote Ugly'' and is appearing in ''Big Trouble'' for Barry Sonnenfeld); he establishes a connection with the audience very quickly, reassuring them with his cocky grin. Mr. Knoxville's early interest was journalism; you can imagine that with a different set of influences, we might have seen Johnny Knoxville, wearing guerrilla mufti, intrepidly reporting from rebel camps in Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knoxville got his start doing participatory journalism for Big Brother, Blunt, Bikini and other skateboard magazines. One of his ideas was the stun gun bit; Jeff Tremaine, the editor of Big Brother and now a producer of ''Jackass,'' encouraged him to videotape it. Mr. Tremaine included the footage in a video he produced of skateboard action, which wended its way to MTV, which became intrigued. Mr. Knoxville and Mr. Tremaine thought up the idea of a stunt-prank show, and Mr. Tremaine enlisted the support of one of his old high school classmates, Spike Jonze, the director of ''Being John Malkovich.'' Mr. Jonze, who had a long association with MTV as a director of music videos, signed on as an executive producer -- ''The whole idea just seemed so funny!'' is pretty much the alpha and the omega of his attraction to the project -- and the three of them worked up some footage and pitched the idea to the network. ''We said, 'Fine,' '' recalls Brian Graden, MTV's president of programming. ''It was just that simple.''</p>
        <p>Like everything else that's new, ''Jackass'' has its antecedents. Laughing at dumb people for the dumb things they do and say is a time-honored amusement: Chico Marx, Gracie Allen, the Three Stooges and, serially and in tandem, Norm, Cliff, Sam and Woody on ''Cheers,'' a show generally considered to be pretty smart. David Letterman built a career on plumbing the inner hipness of doing stupid stuff. (''We'll go into a store called Just Shirts and keep pestering the clerk for things other than shirts. Get it?'') And certainly theatrical risk-taking has an even longer entertainment history, going back to sword swallowers and fire eaters and the geeks who bite the heads off chickens. ''All America likes to see a train wreck,'' says Mr. Knoxville, ''and we're the wreck.''</p>
        <p>MR. GRADEN says, ''I think this show is about Johnny just being a boy,'' using ''boy'' to include his star among those splendid 10- and 11-year-old lads who consider grossing one another out the height of entertainment. But clearly there is more at work in this program. ''Jackass'' has an attitude; it has an edge, and Mr. Graden cheerfully admits it. He admired the ''subversive and underground feel'' of the demo tape and of what the show promised to be; he thought its ''renegade spirit'' fit in well with the rebelliousness inherent in youth culture with which MTV wants to associate itself. When asked if part of what the network liked about ''Jackass'' was the likelihood that its audience's parents would be appalled by it, Mr. Graden did not try to dodge the question. ''Yeah, sure, absolutely,'' he replied. ''I could spin you about that, but I won't.''</p>
        <p>This is not exactly news. Forty-six years have passed since ''The Wild One,'' in which Marlon Brando responded to the question ''What are you rebelling against?'' by asking ''What've you got?'' The answer is evergreen. What is new is the format. Why is being stupid -- doing dangerous stunts, mocking basic human empathy, doing things for the purpose of getting ridiculed -- a medium of rebellion? You can see how burning a draft card was, rightly or wrongly, a relevant rebellion against a war, how having sex was a rebellion against confining sexual norms, how staging a sit-in at a lunch counter was a rebellion against segregation, how taking drugs was a rebellion against a restrictive culture. What is being stupid a rebellion against?</p>
        <p>Maybe the answer is not so obscure. Our children are being scheduled to death, pushed by their loving Bobo parents into an array of stimulating, educational, skill-enhancing classes, programs and activities that often leave them frazzled. Maybe watching a show in which people revel in being irredeemably stupid is a way of sending a message to achievement-obsessed parents. In that case, it's not a program's level of stupidity, or how unfunny it is, that we should pay attention to. It's the anger.</p>
