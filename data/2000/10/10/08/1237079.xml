        <p>Giorgio Armani is considered an artist by those who covet his clothes, so it makes sense that his 25th anniversary as a designer will be commemorated with a retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum. The show, opening on Oct. 20, will feature sketches, photographs and over 300 garments by Mr. Armani, who is known for his classic lines and his Hollywood following. The designer is a mainstay of the power elite on this coast as well. Last Monday, the ''Good Morning America'' co-host Diane Sawyer wore Armani to the star-studded Project A.L.S. benefit at the Manhattan Pavilion. She was a beacon in a sea of black wearers (including Uma Thurman and Juliana Margulies) as she navigated the room in a  hot pink satin suit. The 80's-inspired outfit, with its sleeveless tie-neck top, was glitzier than Armani's typical offerings, but Ms. Sawyer said that if she was of-the-moment it was only by chance. ''I'm a seriously sweat pants kind of gal,'' she said. ''Forget about the clothes. Why don't you write about the fact that I'm still standing at the end of the day? That's my greatest achievement.''</p>
