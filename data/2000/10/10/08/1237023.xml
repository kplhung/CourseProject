        <p>THE animal trapping season on public lands has evolved from a fall and winter ritual where trappers corner muskrats, beavers and other mammals to a quiet war waged by animal rights groups to stop them.</p>
        <p>This fall, the Animal Rights Front of New Haven is planning another protest, and like in previous years, it is taking an unusual, but simple, strategy. It is based not on picketing or acts of civil disobedience, but on the premise that if it can keep the trapping permits, which can cost more than $2,000, out of the hands of trappers, then there will be no trapping on public land. So the group has raised $36,000 and instead of bidding for a few permits as it had done in the past, the group for the first time is trying to win every one of the state's 122 trapping permits. The National Trappers Association of Bloomington, Ill., said it knows of no other state where this is happening.</p>
        <p>''They're well meaning,'' said Stephen Greene of the association. ''Their motive is to save animals, somehow, someway. But if trapping were to cease today, suffering of animals would not stop.''</p>
        <p>The attempt to buy all the permits hasn't exactly thrilled trappers or the State Department of Environmental Protection, which said trapping is necessary to control the beavers, for example, that damage dams and flood property when they build their own dams.</p>
        <p>''Trapping is a wildlife management tool,'' said Fred Becker, a trapper from Durham. ''It's a hobby for us, but these people are really offensive to us. They're taking away our privilege, and it is a privilege.''</p>
        <p>The trapping war began in 1986, when William Mannetti of New Haven, who founded the Animal Rights Front, and Joy Bush of Hamden, another member of the group, got trapping licenses. That year, the two won four-year trapping rights on two sites. The next time the state took bids, in 1990, they won four sites; in 1994, a growing group of anti-trappers got 10. In 1998, the clandestine war escalated. Anti-trappers won 36 sites totaling 47,000 acres of public land.</p>
        <p>Last year, the state altered the bidding process in an attempt to get more of the permits into the hands of experienced trappers. The D.E.P. said bidders would have to prove they had actually killed animals before by providing a body part or a pelt tag issued by the state the previous year. The Animal Rights Front and Darien-based Friends of Animals sued and the state canceled the trapping season in response.</p>
        <p>This year seemed to be heading in the same direction after the animal groups sued the state last month. The D.E.P. had been scheduled to issue the permits last Monday, but a judge in Hartford Superior Court ordered a delay to hear arguments from the two sides. However, a lawyer for the animal rights groups said the judge on Thursday denied the groups' request. A formal ruling was expected on Friday.</p>
        <p>Connecticut's history is tied up in trapping. Explorers seeking beaver pelts navigated the Connecticut River in the 17th century, and the animals were actually a form of currency.</p>
        <p>Today, some people trap the small water-dwelling mammals -- including beaver, muskrat, mink and otter -- as a hobby. In the winter of 1998-99, the last year for which statistics are complete, the D.E.P. reported that trappers killed 10 different species. They included 2,767 muskrats, 722 raccoons, 708 beavers, 222 skunks, 180 mink, 138 possums, 113 otters, 47 red fox, and 28 each of coyote and grey fox.</p>
        <p>Most trapping, however, is done on private land, not public, but much of the private trapping is in response to complaints after an animal has become a nuisance. Public trapping is often done as a hobby.</p>
        <p>''Today, trapping is an avocation,'' said David Leff, a deputy commissioner of the D.E.P. ''It's a very effective way to reduce nuisance populations.''</p>
        <p>He said trapping also sometimes is used to protect rare and endangered species, such as shore birds, whose entire year's brood can be lost to raccoons, coyotes and other animals.</p>
        <p>''You really have to look at it in the context of what nature provides,'' Mr. Leff said. ''Animals die of predation, of diseases, of starvation and of accidents, and none of that is very pleasant. You can't equate their lives to the life style that our pets have.''</p>
        <p>Although the agency said complaints about the animals have increased, it could not connect that with the cancellation of the trapping season last year.</p>
        <p>Many of the anti-trappers said they object to trapping entirely on moral grounds. Mr. Mannetti, who founded Animal Rights Front in the 1980's, said he and his associates don't eat meat or dairy products and have complained about pet stores, protested deer hunts and even tried, one on one, to dissuade hunters. He said he thinks trapping is the worst of all things humans do to animals.</p>
        <p>''This is an old-fashioned issue of cruelty to me,'' Mr. Mannetti said. Of the roughly 400 licensed trappers in Connecticut, he said, ''none have ever testified that they need to sell the pelts to make a living.''</p>
        <p>Connecticut is believed to be the only state in the country where protesters have infiltrated the trapping community.</p>
        <p>There are 31 people here who received the training and licenses needed to qualify to place bids for the permits. To do this, they collected $36,000 from sympathizers. The bids range from about $50 to more than $2,400. These groups have been getting trapping licenses since 1986, but members said this year's effort is by far the largest they've organized.</p>
        <p>''Trapping is always a tough death,'' said Mr. Mannetti, who is a house painter and automobile auction clerk.</p>
        <p>One place he visits occasionally is the Fur, Fin and Feather, an auction house in Chaplin, where he has watched muskrat pelts sell for between 50 cents and $1.50, and beaver pelts for $20 to $40.</p>
        <p>''Nobody's making the claim that they're making money off this,'' said Mr. Mannetti's friend Arlene Corey, 45,a physical therapist for the New Haven school district. Ms. Corey, who is a member of Animal Rights Front, also holds a license so she can bid on trapping sites and visits the vegetation-choked streams of places like Durham Meadows in Durham to get a feel for the numbers of animals and where they are going.</p>
        <p>Ms. Corey gathered a group of supporters at her Seymour home one recent Sunday night. There, Derek V. Oatis, a Manchester lawyer for the firm Beck &amp; Eldergill, helped them do the paperwork to apply for bids and prepare strategy for their lawsuit against the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oatis joined the Animal Rights Front before he finished law school and held a trapping license six years ago so he could bid on trapping sites in 1994 and 1998, which he won.</p>
        <p>Mr. Becker has been trapping around the state since the 1960's, when the limit was three beavers per trapping site. Today it's 25 beavers. He, too, has placed bids on several sites this year. He said the anti-trapping tactics disturb him.</p>
        <p>''I just don't understand how the state has let this happen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Becker said most people don't understand that trapping is not a reckless activity: trappers aren't allowed to set traps in the middle of a field, for instance.</p>
        <p>This year, the department issued regulations that would force winning bidders to trap animals on the site if the state determined that the area was overpopulated with animals, such as beavers or raccoons. But the animal groups filed another court complaint fighting that change.</p>
        <p>A Hartford Superior Court judge ordered the bid-opening delayed until a hearing could take place. The restraining order was very unusual, both sides said.</p>
        <p>The anti-trapping groups said they believed the state has made changes to its bidding rules in direct response to their efforts to win the bids. But Mr. Leff of the D.E.P. said the state wanted proof of previous trapping last year and to reserve the right to require proof that nuisance animals were trapped because they want experienced trappers in the field.</p>
        <p>''The attempt was to get the most experienced people working on public lands,'' he said.</p>
