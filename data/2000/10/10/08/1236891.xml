        <p>The Miss Navajo Pageant isn't about sex. It's about cultural preservation. That's why there's no swimsuit competition, and contestants spend about as much time in standard pageant-issue evening gowns as it takes to boil an egg. ''If there was a swimsuit competition, I would never enter,'' said 19-year-old Leslie John, one of the dozens of junior princesses and regional Miss Navajos who came last month to watch the five-day pageant in Window Rock, Ariz. ''I could have smelled like sheep, and it would have been fine.'' Indeed, the year before, contenders for the Miss Navajo crown had competed in sheep butchering. ''You need the hooves to hang it up with,'' recalled Floranda Dempsey, the only one of this year's four contestants who competed last year. ''But we cut their whole hooves off. We made a huge mess.'' She laughed. ''It was a female. We cut into the breast. Milk everywhere!''</p>
        <p>Instead, the women, outfitted most of the time in moccasins and crushed velvet dresses or tunics that resemble Navajo rugs, with their hair pulled back, had to explain the background of the Treaty of 1868 -- in Navajo. And card wool. And spin it. And demonstrate rug weaving. (Some of the modern contests involved demonstrating CPR, reciting Natalie Merchant lyrics in poetic form and doing aerobics.) They seemed to have the hardest time when they each built a fire, heaped shortening in pans and prepared fry bread -- a traditional food that resembles a Frisbee-size sopaipilla. Karletta Chief, a Ph.D. candidate in environmental engineering and science at Stanford and the daughter of a Baptist preacher, stared angrily at the frying pan resting on her fire. A judge had asked her, in Navajo, about lighting the fire, and she had answered using the word ''liver'' when she meant to say ''bark.'' Valerie Jones, who has a degree in social work from Northern Arizona University, struggled to keep her fire going and looked sad. She had said ''lightning'' instead of ''match.'' (''Those elderly lady judges,'' she noted afterward, ''they really scare us. Because we respect them so much.'') Dempsey, whose spoken Navajo has improved significantly since a medicine man addressed the problem with a ceremony for her, encountered a different problem: she usually uses powdered milk in her recipe, but the pageant hadn't provided any.</p>

        <p>Pageant or no pageant, counteracting cultural entropy isn't for the uncommitted. ''A lot of the homes don't speak Navajo anymore,'' says Jones. ''They don't tell the stories. If it comes to the point where no one's using the corn pollen anymore and if the medicine men are all gone, pretty soon we'll be lost.'' Young people flee the reservation, a swath of high desert and canyons the size of Ireland that sprawls over parts of New Mexico, Utah and Arizona, and its 43 percent unemployment rate to find work. Or they bring in the outside world with satellite dishes, which the Wal-Mart nearby in Gallup, N. M., can't keep in stock. Just about every woman over the age of 60 at the Navajo Nation Fair, where the pageant was being held, had decked herself out in traditional velvet and satin and turquoise. The younger women wore sweat pants and T-shirts, or tight tops and shorts.</p>
        <p>This past year the pressures to represent the culture properly have been even greater than usual. The reigning Miss Navajo, Victoria Yazzie, didn't show up for the first couple of days, prompting officials to consider sending out a policeman to retrieve her crown. A month earlier, in August, the increasingly acrimonious relationship between Yazzie and her staff had degenerated into rumors of pregnancy (which a medical test proved false) and a five-day suspension. ''This is ridiculous,'' said Louise Nelson, proprietor of the Taste the Nation fry-bread booth at the fairgrounds. ''She's the people's choice, our Navajo princess. The Navajo Nation government should worry about themselves and quit bothering Miss Navajo.''</p>
        <p>Yazzie's successor was named on a clear, cold Saturday night. The coronation was the high point of the Navajo Nation Fair, which people attend from all over the reservation for its parade, rodeo, rides, bands and pageant. Gorgeously plumed Aztecs, painted Apaches, grass-skirted Maoris and Zuni maidens balancing pots on their heads danced around the dirt-floored stadium. Yazzie took a lap on a Corvette covered with Navajo rugs, waved at the crowd and exchanged gifts and pleasantries with high tribal officials. The two finalists, Chief and Dempsey, stood frozen and grim in the floodlights. Then the emcee boomed, ''Karletta Chief!'' Chief convulsed with surprise, smiled, waved her tiny arm at the crowd and climbed into the Corvette for a slow lap around the stadium. She would spend a large part of the coming year in a car, driving from school to school to talk to Navajo kids about their culture. She would play host to a monthly traditional-skills workshop at the Navajo Nation Museum. She would be open to every kind of criticism. (As soon as she was crowned, one spectator lamented her family's Christian affiliation. A vendor at the fair had pronounced her ''a city girl,'' although she grew up in a one-room house without heat or running water.) Still, Chief beamed and waved and appeared to get used to the idea.</p>
