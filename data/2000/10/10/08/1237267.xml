        <p>Columbia, led by tailback Johnathan Reese, scored early and often as the Lions coasted by Lafayette, 47-22, yesterday at Wien Stadium. The 47 points were the most scored by a Columbia team since the Lions hammered Brown, 50-0, in 1961.</p>
        <p>The Leopards' defense, which has given up 40 or more points in four of its five games this year, had no answers for Reese.

Before this season, Reese, a junior, had never had a 100-yard game. He now has 617 yards in four games.</p>

        <p>Columbia, led by tailback Johnathan Reese, scored early and often as the Lions coasted by Lafayette, 47-22, yesterday at Wien Stadium. The 47 points were the most scored by a Columbia team since the Lions hammered Brown, 50-0, in 1961.</p>
        <p>The Leopards' defense, which has given up 40 or more points in four of its five games this year, had no answers for Reese. He ran for 201 yards on 30 carries before taking most of the fourth quarter off; he surpassed 100 yards for the fourth time this season. Before this season, Reese, a junior, had never had a 100-yard game. He now has 617 yards in four games.</p>
        <p>''We want to get the ball in his hands a lot because good things happen for us when he does,'' Columbia Coach Ray Tellier said. ''Looking at Lafayette, we thought that we could have success running the football and we did a good job. We've just got to start doing it against better people.''</p>
        <p>Columbia's offense started quickly. After receiving the opening kickoff, the Lions (2-2) marched 61 yards on 10 plays for their first score. Reese, who had 42 yards on the drive, dived in from the 1-yard line for the touchdown four minutes into the game. Kicker Dany Berghoff missed the extra point.</p>
        <p>''Our offensive line did a great job, because I wasn't getting hit until I was 4, 5 yards past the line of scrimmage,'' Reese said. ''That makes for a very easy day for me.''</p>
        <p>Columbia struck again on its next possession. After the defense forced the Leopards to punt after three plays, Columbia took over on the Lafayette 27 after a good return by Travis Chmelka. The Lions soon had a first and goal at the 1-yard line. But three plays later they were still on the 1, as Lafayette stopped Reese twice and Jeff McCall once. On fourth down, McCall faked to Reese and found Kirby Mack, a former fullback who now primarily plays linebacker, open in the flat for the touchdown. The 2-point conversion failed, and Columbia led, 12-0.</p>
        <p>Lafayette got on the scoreboard with a 23-yard field goal by Martin Brecht and scored a touchdown five plays later. Lafayette linebacker Adriel Linyear blocked Ryan Kiernan's punt and reserve tight end Mike Palos picked up the loose ball and rumbled 27 yards for a touchdown. That pulled Lafayette to 12-10.</p>
        <p>But Columbia rebuilt its lead on its last possession of the first half and its first drive of the second half. After an 8-yard punt by Lafayette's Adam Holt gave the Lions good field position, McCall led Columbia 51 yards in nine plays, capping the march with 15-yard pass to Jarel Cockburn, who has emerged as McCall's favorite target this season. McCall's second touchdown pass of the day gave the Lions a 19-10 lead with 44 seconds left in the half.</p>
        <p>On Columbia's opening possession of the second half, Reese plunged in from the 2 to extend the Lions' lead to 26-10.</p>
        <p>From there, Columbia cruised. McCall found split end Doug Peck for a 34-yard touchdown pass late in the third quarter, and Reese ripped off a 37-yard touchdown scamper early in the fourth quarter.</p>
