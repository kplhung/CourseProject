        <p>Roberta Daar's wall reliefs and Dean Powell's chromatic landscapes would be right at home in the American Abstract Artists' ongoing dialogue between geometric and organic abstraction, on view at the Hillwood Art Museum in Brookville. As the exhibition's title implies, the rhythmic interplay of forms is paramount in both artists' approaches, although Mr. Powell roots his imagery in landscape, while Ms. Daar is primarily concerned with interactive shapes for their own sake.</p>

        <p>'Rhythms'</p>
        <p>Omni Gallery, 333 Earle Ovington Boulevard, Uniondale. Through Nov. 10. (516) 396- 0031.</p>
        <p>Roberta Daar's wall reliefs and Dean Powell's chromatic landscapes would be right at home in the American Abstract Artists' ongoing dialogue between geometric and organic abstraction, on view at the Hillwood Art Museum in Brookville. As the exhibition's title implies, the rhythmic interplay of forms is paramount in both artists' approaches, although Mr. Powell roots his imagery in landscape, while Ms. Daar is primarily concerned with interactive shapes for their own sake.</p>
        <p>In her painted wood wall-mounted reliefs using cutout circles, arcs, french curves and rectangular frames, Ms. Daar builds layered constructions that suggest motion in static formats. The descending momentum of ''It's All Downhill,'' emphasized by bright red streaks that complement the downward roll of curving elements, carries the eye inevitably from upper left to lower right, while in ''Dream Land,'' the gaze is drifts through a window-like shape that admits the night's swirling clouds and crescent moon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powell is inspired by the stratified terrain of his native Utah, where erosion has sculpted the land into monolithic mesas echoed by deeply carved canyons. The artist has stylized these natural phenomena into rainbow-hued abstractions that retain the essence of the actual scenery from which they derive.  Sometimes the effect is overly illustrational, especially when Mr. Powell punctuates the composition with cute generic trees, as in ''Earth and Sun Symphony'' and ''Life Force.''  When he concentrates on the overall panorama, as in ''200 Million Years,'' the result is less literal and more evocative. And in ''Desert Grandeur,'' with its wave-like explosion of energy, the raw power of water as a sculptural force is nicely transformed into a pictorial motif.</p>
        <p>'Toward the New'</p>
        <p>Hillwood Art Museum, C. W. Post Campus, Long Island University, Brookville. Through Nov. 12.  (516) 299-4073.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, among the 58 artists included in ''Toward the New: American Abstract Artists,'' an exhibition of work by members of the American Abstract Artists, two are charter members who are still active with the group, which was founded in 1936. One is Ibram Lassaw, in whose Wooster Street studio the avant-gardists first met to discuss the lack of recognition their work was receiving, and then decided to do something about it. The other is Esphyr Slobodkina, who, like Mr. Lassaw, remains committed to the principles of non-representational art that brought the group into being more than 60 years ago.</p>
        <p>The exhibition begins with a historical section chronicling the group's development. In the contemporary section, which comprises the bulk of the show, it is evident that the group still attracts artists for whom representational imagery is anathema. Nevertheless, there are a few pieces, like Phillis Ideal's butterfly-like ''Sweepstakes,'' that suggest figurative content, and even a couple -- Louis Silverstein's ''Chinese Scream,'' for example -- that include recognizable imagery, but they are in the minority. True, Ms. Slobodkina's 1998 oil, ''Flying Objects Immobilized,'' does conjure up fan blades or flapping mechanical wings, complete with hinges, although the emphasis is on the geometry of the forms rather than their practical application.</p>
        <p>As in the old days, there is a geometric camp and an organic contingent, but now supplemented by gestural abstractionists and others who would not have been admitted in the group's original manifestation.  While the group remains committed to first principles, it is flexible enough to accept a more liberal definition of abstraction. Clover Vail's beautiful untitled oil, a richly layered web of impastoed color, is a good example, as is Katinka Mann's ''Black White 3,'' a photographic relief based on a shaped canvas, which subtly combines the abstract and the concrete.</p>
        <p>'Small Works, Top Priority'</p>
        <p>The Stage Gallery, 2222 Hewlett Avenue, Merrick. Through Oct. 22.  (516) 623-3504.</p>
        <p>To be considered for this juried exhibition, artists were required to submit works that fit into a Priority Mail shipping box. Evidently many were actually submitted that way, since the 38 chosen works come from all over the country, as well as Canada and Greece.</p>
        <p>Shows like this are heterogeneous by nature, so the emergence of a dominant theme is both unusual and striking. A significant number of artists have focused on human expression as a subject -- not conventional portraits or figure studies, but feelings and personalities as revealed by the face or body. Madeline G. Meryash's oil, ''Reflecting Attitude,'' captures a teenager's ambivalent self-appraisal; Ken McCall's watercolor, ''Flirt,'' highlights a come-hither glance and alluring stance; James A. Becker's grisaille canvas uses a dramatically posed male nude to heighten the emotional impact of ''Hear''; and Ali Faili's gouache, ''Body Language,'' says it all with posture and gesture instead of words.</p>
        <p>Here, even animals express what we take to be emotions, as in Martha Stiles's sketchy but convincing ''Horse Laugh''; Eugenie Tung's equally spare crayon drawing of a stalking cat with a decidedly human gleam in its eye; and Brigitte Nowak's ''Expectations,'' a tempera painting of a sheepdog that illustrates the man's-best-friend truism.</p>
        <p>Of course not everything in the show fits neatly into the body-language category. Janet M. Gorzegno's two small panel paintings include faces, but they are detached and mask-like, formalistic rather than expressive. In ''Head Souffle,'' the face seems to float on a cushioned column that has been cleverly conjured from wood grain. ''Love Letter II,'' an intricate ink drawing by Patricia Karen Gagic, interweaves biomorphic references like eyes and leaves into a calligraphic web.</p>
