        <p>People talk about Madison Square Park as though it were an elegant lady with awful taste in jewelry. They gush about her greenery, and they applaud the playgrounds and reflecting pools that are part of her continuing $5 million face lift.</p>
        <p>But the park also wears a necklace of idling buses, sometimes more than a dozen at a time, that neighbors say chokes traffic, pollutes the air and discourages visitors.</p>
        <p>Rosalie Shields, who lives nearby, said she did not take her granddaughter to the park because of the buses. ''I wouldn't want her playing in a park that's also a working parking lot,'' Ms. Shields said.</p>
        <p>Madison Square Park is bounded by 23rd and 26th Streets and Fifth and Madison Avenues. Besides the regular city buses running on three sides, it has long been the starting point for commuter bus services like Liberty Lines, New York Bus Service and Jamaica Bus Lines. The heavy bus traffic begins about 8 a.m. and starts slowing down around 9:30 p.m., said Sharon Ullman of the 23rd Street Block Association.</p>
        <p>Arlene Harrison, president of the nearby Gramercy Park Neighborhood Association, said bus drivers often left their engines idling on breaks, sometimes for an hour or longer. Because diesel emissions are linked to asthma and other respiratory illnesses, city and state laws say buses may not idle for more than three minutes.</p>
        <p>''It's always been bad, but now it's just gotten so much worse,'' Ms. Harrison said. ''This area has become the center of a tourist mecca, and these idling buses have created not only a traffic nightmare but a threat to the health of our many small children who play here.''</p>
        <p>Neil Erickson of Liberty Lines, a commuter service at 26th Street and Madison Avenue, said buses no longer needed to idle to keep engines warm. He said he had trained his drivers to turn off their engines during breaks. ''We do hear the community's concerns,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Gerard Shriffen, a lawyer and a co-chairman of the Manhattan Neighborhood Council, a community group, has been studying diesel emissions in the city for 12 years, and he said the city's Department of Environmental Protection, which with the police handles air pollution complaints, needs to ticket drivers more aggressively.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Ryan, a spokesman for the environmental department, said it responded to 163 idling bus complaints in Manhattan last year and 573 citywide.</p>
        <p>At a Community Board 5 meeting recently, Kyle Merker, the chairman, said Madison Square Park needed a solution, not more tickets.</p>
        <p>''We also don't want to push our problem off to another neighborhood,'' he said. ''The buses have to sit somewhere, but we want the city to  come up with a comprehensive plan. Cure the sickness, not just symptoms.''</p>
