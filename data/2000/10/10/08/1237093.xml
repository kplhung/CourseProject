        <p>IT is not so much that Gore Vidal entered the theater but that the theater entered him. Last week, he came to full attention at the back of the Virginia Theater to catch the last 15 minutes of ''Gore Vidal's 'The Best Man,' '' his 1960 satire of a political convention. When Spalding Gray, playing one candidate, delivered his comeuppance line, ''If I'm so unstable, why did you offer me the ambassadorship to Red China?'' Mr. Vidal reared back and laughed.</p>
        <p>He was literally enjoying himself, wrapped by words he wrote 40 years ago. For him, 40 years is a mere bagatelle. As the evening went on, references scampered from the year 2000 to abstruse words from the 18th century to creation itself. It was hard to believe that Mr. Vidal had not been there to witness it all.</p>

        <p>IT is not so much that Gore Vidal entered the theater but that the theater entered him. Last week, he came to full attention at the back of the Virginia Theater to catch the last 15 minutes of ''Gore Vidal's 'The Best Man,' '' his 1960 satire of a political convention. When Spalding Gray, playing one candidate, delivered his comeuppance line, ''If I'm so unstable, why did you offer me the ambassadorship to Red China?'' Mr. Vidal reared back and laughed.</p>
        <p>He was literally enjoying himself, wrapped by words he wrote 40 years ago. For him, 40 years is a mere bagatelle. As the evening went on, references scampered from the year 2000 to abstruse words from the 18th century to creation itself. It was hard to believe that Mr. Vidal had not been there to witness it all.</p>
        <p>As soon as the final bows were taken, Mr. Vidal, 75, went backstage. ''How was my bow?'' Charles Durning asked, standing in his dressing room in his boxers.</p>
        <p>''Not as crisp,'' Mr. Vidal answered. (This is a man who gives notes on bows.)</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Ashley, in a tentlike dressing gown, screamed when she saw Mr. Vidal. ''I was sorry to miss your bacchanalia at Elaine's last night, darling,'' she said. They exchanged hugs and ''darlings'' and a couple of rounds of ''the Vienna drapes!'' (a line he had given her in the play that didn't get a laugh).</p>
        <p>''Not even a titterette, as Cyril Ritchard called it,'' he said. Then Mr. Vidal offered up a new word for her: ''The 'megrims,' darling, the 18th-century word for the vapors.'' ''Megrims,'' she said. ''I love it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vidal and his companion, Howard Austen, took a taxi to Sardi's, where there was to be a party for Mr. Vidal, who would leave the next day for his home in Los Angeles to promote his new book, ''The Golden Age.'' ''It used to be so easy,'' he said. ''I'd do Hugh Downs on the morning show, and then go to the coast and do Carson and that's all you needed. Now, it's Sunday morning, 4 a.m., some local radio show.''</p>
        <p>Nearing Sardi's, he said, ''everyone I've ever known is now a theater -- Bob Fosse, Helen Hayes, even Neil Simon.'' (''Don't quote me, dear,'' he added. ''That's someone else's line.'')</p>
        <p>At Sardi's, the entire cast was assembled, as effusive as if it hadn't seen Mr. Vidal since the English Reformation. Chris Noth rushed over with a question about his character's last name. ''Cantwell,'' he said. ''What does that mean again?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vidal reeled off his answer: ''Cant, cant well. Cant equals boilerplate. There were fundamental Protestants in England and they would chant phrases with no meaning. Chant. Cant.'' Mr. Noth beamed.</p>
        <p>Max Klimavicous, manager of Sardi's, presented Mr. Vidal with the barely recognizable caricature that would hang in the restaurant downstairs. ''The tiny nose,'' Mr. Vidal said, ''is because I lifted my chin. That foreshortens the nose.'' The actors made a mental note.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ashley arrived. ''I'm just drinking here,'' she said. Well, she was also grabbing appetizers and remembering the old days. ''I was dating this senator who was separated but not divorced,'' she said, and a representative was her beard. ''That's old news, darling -- 20 years old,'' she clarified. ''You can't find any recent smut on me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vidal had a huddle with Mr. Gray and the play's youthful director, Ethan McSweeny, and the talk turned literary. Mr. Gray said, ''I was reading Sartre's 'Being and Nothingness,' '' and Mr. Vidal responded: ''Did you ever read 'Nausea?' It's all there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gray pointed out the existential angst of appearing in a play. ''There are times when I'm out there and I think, 'This is a nightmare,' '' he said. ''It's 'No Exit.' The same words over and over. Every night.''</p>
        <p>Then it was midnight. The play had been seen, the cast jollied, wisdom imparted, the caricature unveiled. And Mr. Vidal went back to the Plaza to get some sleep before the rigors of the next day, and the next, and the one after that.</p>
