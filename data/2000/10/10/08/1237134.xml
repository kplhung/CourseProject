        <p>THE Internet's usefulness in researching and, more recently, in buying and selling mutual funds is growing rapidly. Many mutual funds, including some once available only through middlemen, are becoming as easy to buy online as stocks.</p>
        <p>Nearly all sizable fund families have Web sites that let investors read prospectuses, review fund performance, check personal accounts and conduct other online research, and print out the paperwork to be mailed in to open an account. In many cases, money can be moved from one fund to another within a fund family at the click of a mouse. Almost half of all Internet users who own fund shares visited one or more such sites in the year through last March, up from one-third just 18 months earlier, according to the Investment Company Institute, the fund trade group.</p>

        <p>THE Internet's usefulness in researching and, more recently, in buying and selling mutual funds is growing rapidly. Many mutual funds, including some once available only through middlemen, are becoming as easy to buy online as stocks.</p>
        <p>Nearly all sizable fund families have Web sites that let investors read prospectuses, review fund performance, check personal accounts and conduct other online research, and print out the paperwork to be mailed in to open an account. In many cases, money can be moved from one fund to another within a fund family at the click of a mouse. Almost half of all Internet users who own fund shares visited one or more such sites in the year through last March, up from one-third just 18 months earlier, according to the Investment Company Institute, the fund trade group.</p>
        <p>The latest wrinkle is to eliminate all paperwork and do everything online from scratch. That is now easier, thanks to a new law that gives electronic signatures the same legal standing as handwritten ones.</p>
        <p>E*Trade, the online stockbroker, lets its customers buy any of 5,200 funds electronically, some with sales loads and some without, and offers a feature called PowerSearch to help them choose suitable funds. E*Trade will even advance an investor as much as $1,000 almost instantly to make a fund investment, without waiting for the investor's check to arrive, according to Liat Rorer, a company vice president. The Web address is www.etrade.com.</p>
        <p>Salomon Smith Barney, a subsidiary of Citigroup, has said it will offer comparable transaction capability at www.salomonsmithbarney.com through its AssetOne program beginning a week from today.</p>
        <p>Fidelity Investments (www.fidelity.com) and Vanguard Group (www.vanguard.com), the two biggest fund groups, also plan to let investors open accounts online.</p>
        <p>General Electric Asset Management, which is relatively new to the retail fund business and was a pioneer in dropping sales loads for Internet purchases, requires that an account be established before it can accept online orders at www.gefn.com.</p>
        <p>Charles Schwab's fund supermarket, OneSource, is eight years old and offers more than 1,200 no-load, no-transaction-fee funds. At www.schwab.com/funds, investors can buy and sell shares online in funds from multiple families and gather them all into a single account. Cash must be deposited in the account before orders are accepted. By year-end, Schwab plans to offer an e-mail alert service like the one it provides for individual stocks.</p>
