        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a 26-year-old fan of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and the creator of the original official Web site, I wanted to thank you for Steve Vineberg's article ''Yes, She's a Vampire Slayer; No, Her Show Isn't Kid Stuff'' [Oct. 1]. Mr. Vineberg obviously understands the show, and Joss Whedon's vision. Mr. Whedon's vision for the movie ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' was very similar to what the television show is now, but there were too many people who tinkered with his view and turned it into the campy farce that it ended up being. I don't know if ''Buffy,''  ''Angel'' and Mr. Whedon (and the talented stars and crew behind the scenes) will get the due they deserve anytime soon, but it's nice to see such a fair and positive piece about the show(s).</p>
