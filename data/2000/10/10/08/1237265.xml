        <p>The four-story brownstone at 44 King Street was the center of life for the Di Fiores, a family of eight Sicilian brothers and sisters who packed up their dreams and followed one another from Bagheria, Italy, to Greenwich Village a century ago.</p>
        <p>The immigrants, all young adults, made their living baking bread, earning enough so that each of them could settle into a home of his or her own, though none was as spacious as 44 King Street, the home of one of the brothers, Cosimo, and soon the family's unofficial headquarters.</p>
        <p>On Sundays and holidays, they returned to King Street to watch the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Silvestre and Maria Cristina Di Fiore, who followed their eight children to New York, slide down banisters, make mischief amid the dahlias in the garden out back and, of course, feast on macaroni. By the mid-1970's, the house had been sold and the tradition of the weekly gatherings laid to rest.</p>
        <p>But this weekend, 140 Di Fiores from 15 states and from as far away as Bagheria  descended on New York, to look at the old house and to rekindle the bonds that time and distance had severed. And the lengths to which the Di Fiores -- particularly the organizers, two first cousins from Virginia -- went to make the gathering happen would impress even the most skilled Manhattan party planner.</p>
        <p>It has certainly amazed the Di Fiores, a family with so many branches that many members have never met each other, let alone endeavored to plan a reunion so involved that it could be called a three-day festival, complete with an official family cookbook, registry and Web site.</p>
        <p>The reunion's organizers were able to trace the steps of the descendants of all but two of the eight brothers and sisters who came to the United States between 1899 and 1905.</p>
        <p>Thousands of American families are making similar efforts, said Edith Wagner, author of ''The Family Reunion Sourcebook'' and editor of Reunions, a quarterly magazine for family, military and school class reunion organizers.</p>
        <p>''People today are spread out all over the country, and young families are learning very quickly that their children will probably grow up without really knowing their aunts, uncles and cousins,'' she said. ''For them, an elaborate weekend or weeklong reunion may be the only chance at recreating a sense of closeness.''</p>
        <p>Said James J. Cattano, 58, one of Silvestre and Maria Cristina's 28 great-grandchildren: ''Frankly, you don't see a lot of people putting family on a pedestal and making family the priority, as it once was. So I thought maybe 20 or 30 people from my generation would get together at a restaurant somewhere, talk a little about the old days and call it a night. I had no idea our family was large enough to pull off something like this or that so many of them would make the time.''</p>
        <p>When St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church in the Village opens today for 11 a.m. Mass, regular parishioners might do a double take as the Di Fiore delegation makes its way into the sanctuary where so many of their forebears had baptisms, marriages and funerals. At a Sicilian banquet last night, the Di Fiores got their first look at the family's 35-page cookbook, courtesy of a cousin in Utah, whose task it was to collect and compile recipes from relatives across the country.</p>
        <p>The Di Fiores had intended to ask the current owners of 44 King Street to allow them inside. But reunion organizers gave up on that idea when they discovered that there more Di Fiores than they were aware of.</p>
        <p>After deciding that asking for a tour of the house might be a little too much, some of the Di Fiores who live in the New York region were drafted to design a walking tour of the old neighborhood.</p>
        <p>From the Washington Square Hotel, where many of the Di Fiores are staying,  they planned a route to the house on King Street, then to buildings along Sullivan, Thompson and Macdougal, the streets where generations of Di Fiores raised families, ran bakeries and worked as accountants. From the Village, the Di Fiores were bound for Ellis Island for a look at their family's gateway to America.</p>
        <p>Of course, the Di Fiore gathering was not without two accessories necessary for any successful reunion -- buttons and T-shirts, imprinted with a family crest designed by one cousin, which features a baker clutching loaves of bread. The image is surrounded by the words: ''We remember. We celebrate.''</p>
        <p>Though many of the homes and shops  where the Di Fiores lived and toiled have been replaced, the reunion's organizers said it was enough just to walk the streets their ancestors walked.</p>
        <p>''We had to come,'' said Cecilia Balog, Cosimo Di Fiore's granddaughter. ''Our generation really is the last that had contact with a generation that spoke only Italian and believed that family was everything. This whole weekend is about trying to pass on a little of that experience to generations who had no contact with it.''</p>
