        <p>ANY salesperson will tell you that it is easier and more cost-efficient to retain customers rather than to bring in new ones. In the business of running a small, professional theater, however, neither is a cakewalk. Stamford Theater Works, which started its 13th season recently with Russell Lee's serio-comedy ''Nixon's Nixon,'' has proven to be the little theater that could.</p>
        <p>Steve Karp, the founder and producing director, said that his theater averaged renewals of about 90 percent of its season subscribers, the backbone of any theater budget. Mr. Karp has achieved this retention rate while presenting a combination of area premieres and recent Off Broadway plays that have a strong social relevance.</p>

        <p>ANY salesperson will tell you that it is easier and more cost-efficient to retain customers rather than to bring in new ones. In the business of running a small, professional theater, however, neither is a cakewalk. Stamford Theater Works, which started its 13th season recently with Russell Lee's serio-comedy ''Nixon's Nixon,'' has proven to be the little theater that could.</p>
        <p>Steve Karp, the founder and producing director, said that his theater averaged renewals of about 90 percent of its season subscribers, the backbone of any theater budget. Mr. Karp has achieved this retention rate while presenting a combination of area premieres and recent Off Broadway plays that have a strong social relevance.</p>
        <p>''I hear that people know what we stand for,'' he said. ''I don't feel badly about that. We can deviate now and again, but we have an identity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Karp, a Stamford native and resident who acted and directed in New York and regionally before starting his theater, said that Stamford Theater Works had nurtured its loyal audience through this consistency.</p>
        <p>''When I started the theater I noticed that the successful regional theaters had an identity,'' he said. ''Long Wharf had an identity for doing challenging English and Irish plays. Hartford Stage was doing the classics. I wanted to do contemporary plays with a social conscience.''</p>
        <p>That means plays unfamiliar to most theatergoers. Stamford Theater Works opened in 1988 with the Roger Cornish drama ''A Class C Trial in Yokohama,'' not exactly a household name.</p>
        <p>In the 1991 season the theater gave the world premiere of John Ford Noonan's ''Listen to the Lions.'' With the exception of an occasional A. R. Gurney or Joe Orton comedy, Mr. Karp culls his selections from Off Broadway or the Humana Festival at the Actors Theater of Louisville, a breeding ground for new plays.</p>
        <p>The theater's new season, for instance, consists entirely of area premieres. After ''Nixon's Nixon,'' which continues through Oct. 8, the season continues with Warren Leight's Off Broadway hit about jazz musicians, ''Side Man'' (Nov. 1 - Nov. 19); William Mastrosimone's play ''Tamer of Horses'' (Jan. 31 - Feb. 18), and Michael Hollinger's comedy, ''An Empty Plate at the Cafe du Grand Boeuf'' (April 18 - May 6).</p>
        <p>Though presenting relatively unknown plays is risky business, it has proved successful. Mr. Karp said he felt that Stamford's previous regional theater, the Hartman, which closed just before Stamford Theater Works was created, did not benefit from presenting a hodgepodge of plays, anything from George Bernard Shaw's ''Millionairess'' to the George S. Kaufman-Marc Connolly comedy ''Merton of the Movies.''  ''The people running the Hartman said, 'How can we compete with New York?' I never thought that was the question,'' Mr. Karp said.</p>
        <p>''I thought that being 35 miles outside of Manhattan was a positive thing,'' he said. ''You are that close to the best acting talent. Actors can work here and not leave home. They can do commercial and television work while they're working here.''</p>
        <p>Though Stamford Theater Works occasionally hires a name actor -- Malachy McCourt, Elizabeth Wilson, Keir Dullea and Bonnie Franklin, for instance -- it mostly uses talented,  lesser known actors. Since it presents contemporary plays, Mr. Karp noted, the theater performs plays with smaller casts. This helps keep budgets under control.</p>
        <p>''We have an intimate theater, 150 seats,'' he said. He noted that in its first space the Hartman had a 1,000-seat house, then it moved to a 1,600-seat house. ''I think our subscribers appreciate watching a play in a smaller space,'' he added.</p>
        <p>At least 90 percent of them, it is clear. ''That's given us a stability and ability to plan a challenging program,'' Mr. Karp said. ''It's gratifying to know that the subscribers will renew.''</p>
        <p>A four-play subscription to the Stamford Theater Works ranges from $46 to 85, single tickets $13.50 to $25. For more information, call (203) 359-4414 or visit its Web site at www.stamfordtheatreworks.org.</p>
