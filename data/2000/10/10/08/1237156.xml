        <p>I MISSED you at our junior high school reunion.</p>
        <p>Well, that's not exactly true, since you and I probably didn't attend junior high school together. But did that line grab you at all?</p>
        <p>You see, I'm trying out e-mail subject lines that will get people's attention. I'm in training to send unsolicited commercial e-mail, otherwise known as spam. Here are some of the possibilities I have in the lab:</p>
        <p>* ''Your mom referred me.''</p>
        <p>* ''Your dentist says hello.''</p>
        <p>* ''I bought you some cheese!''</p>
        <p>* ''You left a pie at my house.''</p>
        <p>Lately, it seems, spammers have become more intimate in their subject lines, often hinting at some connection to the recipient. Messages to me that were labeled ''Hi'' turned out to be a get-rich-quick scheme,  ''How's it going'' was for pornography, ''Re: the information you requested'' advertised an herbal alternative to Viagra, and ''Fire the creep you call your boss'' was yet another money-making adventure.</p>
        <p>Like most people, I know better than to open a message marked ''Offensively prurient photos'' or ''Become a millionaire while you tan.'' But who wouldn't be intrigued by the overture, ''I found your lawn chair''?</p>
        <p>Diane Doletzy, for one. She is the sales manager for Extractor Pro, a program used to compile e-mail addresses in bulk and to send commercial messages to them. ''I'd go for 'I found your ring,' '' she said, ''but I don't know about a lawn chair.''</p>
        <p>In my quest to understand the delicate difference between an e-mail subject line that will make you look and one that will make you delete without reading, I asked Ms. Doletzy for hints and received a simple, curt response: honesty. ''We don't believe in lying,'' she said. The subject line should reflect the contents, she added, and ''we don't believe in sending e-mail to people unless they ask for it.'' Furthermore, she said, when somebody does use the company's software to send unsolicited e-mail, it ought to include a way to decline to receive future overtures. So maybe the company isn't 100 percent opposed to spam after all? Well, yes, she conceded, but she stood firm that the subject line should always be very honest about the content.</p>
        <p>Next, I tried Mark Sabatini, owner of Floodgate, another maker of bulk e-mail software. He did not return my first, plain-vanilla phone message, but he did call back after I modified it slightly on a second try.</p>
        <p>''What do you mean, you were recommended by my orthopedic surgeon?'' he said.</p>
        <p>In my second message, I had said I was a New York Times reporter referred to him by his specialist, which I later conceded was not strictly accurate. But despite the fact that he returned my second message and not my first, Mr. Sabatini said e-mail subject lines should always be truthful, because people will see through the lies and ignore them.</p>
        <p>Plus, he said, honesty is the best way to establish credibility. For instance, he has started sending bulk e-mail on behalf of a client who offers investment services. The subject line is ''Free investment package.''</p>
        <p>I expressed amazement that his client's business model revolved around giving stuff away, but Mr. Sabatini said that after recipients get the free investment materials, they are asked if they want to invest in a new wireless Internet telecommunications company -- an offer that, if you want to be technical about it, is not entirely free.</p>
        <p>Still, I was making headway. The experts agreed that the way to prompt an immediate reply was to send honest, personal overtures that disclosed the true nature of the message. I decided to test the idea by sending a few to people who had spammed me.</p>
        <p>''Tell YOUR side of the story,'' I wrote in the subject line, on a message to someone who had sent me one labeled ''Want to know? Here's how.'' The message advertised software used to find personal and background information on anyone, including a spouse or employee.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, it did not include a way to find information about the person I was seeking, its sender. The return address turned out to be fictitious, and my e-mail bounced back undeliverable.</p>
        <p>I tried this method several more times, asking for ''YOUR side of the story'' from the senders of e-mails labeled ''Information in regard to your inquiry,'' which offered a way for me to keep all of my tax dollars, and ''Jenny's Contact Info,'' which was selling access to an adult Web site. Alas, I heard not a word in reply.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the product I was offering -- an opportunity to be made fun of in a newspaper column -- was not sufficiently enticing. I don't know.</p>
        <p>What I do know is that readers should tune in to next month's column, when I promise that ''I will fix your molars.'' In the meantime, if you'll excuse me, I've got to log on and learn how to fire that creep I call my boss.</p>
