        <p>DREAM CATCHER</p>

        <p>There was a moment in her childhood when Margaret Salinger's father told her what his experience during World War II was like. The single sentence she quotes reveals far more about J. D. Salinger, his subsequent life and work than any of the neurotic peculiarities and spiritual eccentricities his daughter serves up in this unsettling memoir.</p>
        <p>Until now, little more was known than that he served in the European theater. But in ''Dream Catcher'' Margaret Salinger pieces together the whole story from her father's recollections and her own research into the history of the 12th Infantry Regiment, in which he served as staff sergeant and counterintelligence officer.</p>
        <p>In fact, just a few years before he began writing ''The Catcher in the Rye,'' published in 1951, J. D. Salinger fought through some of the worst carnage of the war: the D-Day landing in Normandy on Utah Beach, and the battles that followed -- Hrtgen Forest, Luxembourg, the Battle of the Bulge. In just the first 10 weeks his unit's casualty totals were ''about 125 percent of the original 3,080 men'' and their replacements, Margaret Salinger writes. ''The few men who lived through it were left with much to sicken them, body and soul.'' And then after all that, her father was ''one of the first soldiers to walk into a certain, just liberated, concentration camp.''</p>
        <p>Salinger says she forgets the name of the camp, and she has not tried to retrieve it or any other missing pieces of her father's history from him because they haven't spoken since he learned that she was planning to publish this memoir. But she does remember that one chilling sentence he uttered when she asked about his wartime experience: ''You never really get the smell of burning flesh out of your nose entirely,'' he told her. ''No matter how long you live.''</p>
        <p>There were two short-term consequences to her father's year in hell: hospitalization at the end of the war for ''battle fatigue'' (usually a euphemism for combat-induced breakdown) and a brief marriage to a German woman Salinger had arrested during the Occupation, a woman Margaret Salinger says was a minor Nazi party official. The bizarre marriage (Salinger was half Jewish and had been brought up, Margaret says, thinking both his parents were Jews) was short-lived and can perhaps be seen as a manifestation of the Stockholm syndrome for both parties.</p>
        <p>But the exposure to burning flesh seems to have had more profound long-term consequences for Salinger's life and his work. And it is the latter that points up the problem posed by this memoir for those who believe that Salinger is still a writer worth attending to. Because while one often feels deeply uneasy over what one learns about the private person -- reading this book is like overhearing one side of a bitter family quarrel -- there is information here that can't help altering, and enlarging, our estimation of his work.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it shouldn't. There is much to be said for the purists' argument that the words of a writer should be allowed to speak for themselves: they're all that counts. Do the personal flaws matter? At times one can't help thinking of Eliot's line, ''After such knowledge, what forgiveness?'' But certain revelations in this memoir may well prompt a reassessment of the place of Salinger's fiction in American literature, add a dimension to the marginalized mystic he's become to many.</p>
        <p>Consider Salinger's most famous short story, ''A Perfect Day for Bananafish'' -- a story in which Seymour Glass, the elusive poet-mystic who comes to dominate so much of Salinger's later work, wades into the ocean on his honeymoon and then blows his brains out in a beachfront hotel room. It's almost impossible now not to see its kinship to ''Big Two-Hearted River,'' Hemingway's classic story about a World War I veteran who wades into the eponymous river and glimpses shadows of the heart of darkness in its depths.</p>
        <p>There's only one oblique reference in ''Bananafish'' to Seymour's wartime service in Germany, and generations of scholars and term paper writers have tied themselves into exegetical knots attempting to explain the apparently unmotivated suicide. I'd argue that ''Bananafish,'' like ''Big Two-Hearted River,'' is a story that says nothing about the war and yet says everything about the war. Margaret Salinger tells us that her father made a point of looking up Hemingway, who was serving as a war correspondent in liberated Paris, and showing him a copy of one of his early war stories (''Last Day of the Last Furlough''), so perhaps the affinity was no accident.</p>
        <p>But it's an affinity that goes beyond ''Bananafish.'' In both his life and his work J. D. Salinger brought the war home, brought it home in the form of a desperate search for peace that torments his characters and seems to have tormented his own character. Holed up in his hilltop retreat in New Hampshire, Salinger waged the war for peace with one spiritual weapon after another. As his daughter chronicles it, it was ''Zen Buddhism, Vedanta Hinduism, 1950's off and on; Kriya yoga, 1954-55; Christian Science, 1955 off and on to present; Scientology, called Dianetics at the time, 1950's; something having to do with the work of Edgar Cayce; homeopathy and acupuncture, 1960's to present; macrobiotics, 1966. . . .''</p>
        <p>What these disciplines all have in common, of course, is the promise of relief from, or transcendence of, the sufferings of the flesh. The problem for Margaret Salinger was that her father often extended those experiments to his family. She was born in 1955, shortly after Salinger had moved with his young wife, Claire Douglas, to the wintry isolation of New Hampshire. Margaret reports that almost from birth she served as a guinea pig for her father's spiritual enthusiasms. When she fell ill as a baby, she says, she wasn't taken to the doctor. Salinger ''had suddenly embraced Christian Science, and now, in addition to being forbidden any friends or visitors, doctors were out.'' (At times a dogged investigator of her lost past, the author tells us she tracked down income tax returns from the 1950's to confirm that her father consulted Christian Science practitioners about her infant illnesses.)</p>
        <p>It was Christian Science, with its belief that illness is Error and flesh is Illusion, that some 40 years later was also the cause of the traumatic break between father and daughter, after what Margaret Salinger describes as a disease-and-dysfunction-plagued life that she mostly blames on her upbringing in the cultic isolation of the Salinger Fortress of Silence.</p>
        <p>It's not a life without achievement: Margaret graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Brandeis, earned a degree from Oxford as a labor mediation specialist and studied at Harvard Divinity School. She seems quite intelligent and can write with clarity. But a few years ago (she's 44 now), she tells us, she was laid low by chronic fatigue syndrome and then found her disability payments cut off by her insurance company, which disputed the diagnosis. There were, she says, ''days I was too ashamed to call anyone over to help because I'd lost control of my bowels or bladder again and couldn't change the sheets yet.'' Her worst fear, she writes, ''was not dying, but that I'd wind up living, destitute, in some state nursing home. . . . I called and told my father the grave news that my disability payments had been cut off. A week or two later, something arrived in the mail. He had taken out a three-year subscription, in my name, to a monthly booklet of testimonials to miraculous healing put out by the Christian Science Church. . . . I would get well when I stopped believing in the 'illusion' of my sickness. What began to crack was my belief in the illusion of my father.''</p>
        <p>It was at this point that Salinger decided to write this book. She says she wrote it for her own sake, as therapy, as deprogramming for her cultic upbringing. But in her own way she seems just as deeply in thrall to wishful spirituality as her father, only hers is of the more glib, contemporary, New Age variety, which appropriates bits of decontextualized Native American culture as its response to suffering. The ''dream catcher'' of her title, for instance, is an icon consisting of a net and a feather she hangs over her son's bed to filter out the bad dreams; it's a device to censor out suffering, in other words.</p>
        <p>She says she wrote the memoir for the sake of her young son, too, so that he will understand the family history and the chain of suffering will be broken. Very noble, but there's something a bit disingenuous about this piety: if the account is really just meant as therapy, what need was there to publish it? (Her brother has expressed dismay at the fact of the book, and dissent from his sister's portrait of their family.) Or if it was somehow necessary to publish it, what need was there to rush it into print when her father, now 81, was still alive to be hurt by it? Unless the hurt was part of the therapy. If money was the object, one imagines she could have gotten a substantial advance on the promise to dish the dirt after he died.</p>
        <p>Still, Salinger has the right to tell her own story as she sees it (although some might wonder if the pages and pages she devotes to mean boarding school mistresses and past boyfriends would be published if she weren't also revealing her father's secrets). And whatever her other motives, she clearly believes that it is we, too, who need to be disillusioned as she was; that it is important to destroy the illusion that the authors we love are perfect gurus and saints as well. While it's true J. D. Salinger has attracted and suffered from that kind of adulation, is this really an illusion many people need to be disabused of at this point?</p>
        <p>Those who have the courage to wade through the thicket of ''Seymour: An Introduction,'' Salinger's penultimate published story, one that wrestles tortuously, and comically, with the contradictions of living a spiritual life in a material world, will find an eerily anticipatory passage about the way ''our gusto for the lurid or the partly lurid (which, of course, includes both low and superior gossip) is probably the last of our fleshy appetites to be sated or effectively curbed,'' as Salinger's narrator observes. ''A good many people . . . respond with a special impetus, a zing, even, in some cases, to artists and poets who as well as having a reputation for producing great or fine art have something garishly Wrong with them as persons: a spectacular flaw. . . . God have mercy on the lonely bastards.''</p>
        <p>God will have to have mercy on that lonely bastard up there in Cornish, N.H., because his daughter doesn't. But the real problem with her book, the real problem with literary biography in general, is that while in some cases it can expand our sense of an author's work (as Margaret's account of her father's wartime experience undoubtedly does) more often it can be reductive.</p>
        <p>Reading ''The Catcher in the Rye'' in light of what she knows of her father's life, for example, Margaret seems to assume that the book is an uncritical endorsement of Holden Caulfield's point of view, of his adolescent romanticism and his embittered crusade against ''phonies.'' What in fact makes the novel transcend the fevered point of view of its unreliable narrator is its ambivalence, the implicit critique it counterpoises to Holden's sometimes cruel disdain for souls less pure than he. Similarly, Margaret Salinger construes ''A Perfect Day for Bananafish'' as purely an endorsement of Seymour's revulsion at the vulgarity of the material world, when in some crucial ways it can be read as a critique of the self-destructive nature of spiritual absolutism.</p>
        <p>Her approach is something like that of those who read Tolstoy's late novella ''The Kreutzer Sonata'' (with its narrator's vicious diatribe against flesh and sexuality) as merely an advertisement for the author's late-life fanaticism on the subject -- a pamphlet rather than a work of art. But even though Tolstoy in his dotage was as desperate and gullible a spiritual seeker as Salinger seems in this memoir, he never stopped being an artist who produced a complex work whose bitter comic excesses undercut the credibility of its simple-minded, flesh-hating narrator.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most important revelation about her father's work Salinger has to offer bears on the mystery of what he's been working on, or whether he's been working at all (as opposed to, say, compulsively typing ''all work and no play make J. D. a dull boy,'' like Jack Nicholson in ''The Shining''). Ever since his last story appeared in The New Yorker in 1965, people have wondered whether his silence extends to his work as well as his life. Not just whether he's writing, but if he is, whether he'll ever publish -- or even whether he's determined to burn everything he's written the way Gogol did with the second part of ''Dead Souls'' under the influence of some fanatic, puritanical monks.</p>
        <p>In fact, Margaret Salinger's account seems to confirm that Salinger has been writing steadily and that he wants us to read what he's written, if only after he dies. She quotes from a letter she wrote to him in which she says, ''I remembered how relieved I was when you showed me one time how you had everything labeled and organized so it wouldn't either be thrown out by stupid people or make things hellish for smart ones.'' This is a remarkable disclosure; one hopes this book won't change his mind.</p>
        <p>Nor should it. His daughter seems to see nothing but neurosis and eccentricity in her father's devotion to silence and privacy. But it's still possible to see that devotion, at least in part, as a principled stance; to see J. D. Salinger as a kind of conscientious objector to the Publicity Industrial Complex that commodifies writers' lives and turns them into commercial surrogates for their work. In this view, his continued silence is, in its own way, an enduring and powerful work of art. It's still there for those with ears to hear the sound of one hand clapping.</p>
