        <p>I ADORE the Met, there's no question about that,'' Alberto W. Vilar said. ''I go into that place, and I get goose pimples. Wow, this is the Met!

        <p>If anyone has earned -- or at least, purchased -- the right to hold court at the Met, it is Mr. Vilar, a 60-year-old Cuban-American investor and opera fan who has lately been parlaying his acuity in the world of high-tech stocks into a philanthropic boon for the opera world. A member of the board of the Metropolitan Opera since 1995, he contributed $25 million to the company's endowment fund, and he has pledged to underwrite 10 Met productions, at about $2 million apiece.

        <p>I ADORE the Met, there's no question about that,'' Alberto W. Vilar said. ''I go into that place, and I get goose pimples. Wow, this is the Met! My rich friends laugh at me, because I sit in the same seat every night, in the first row. A101, that's my seat. I want to watch the conductor, the pit, the stage. Not only that, I hold court. My friends come up. They know where I am.''</p>
        <p>If anyone has earned -- or at least, purchased -- the right to hold court at the Met, it is Mr. Vilar, a 60-year-old Cuban-American investor and opera fan who has lately been parlaying his acuity in the world of high-tech stocks into a philanthropic boon for the opera world. A member of the board of the Metropolitan Opera since 1995, he contributed $25 million to the company's endowment fund, and he has pledged to underwrite 10 Met productions, at about $2 million apiece. So far, he has paid for the company's productions of ''Cosi Fan Tutte,'' ''La Cenerentola,''  ''La Traviata'' and ''Le Nozze di Figaro.''</p>
        <p>The ''Fidelio'' that opens on Friday evening will be the fifth, and Busoni's ''Doktor Faust,'' a co-production with the Salzburg Festival in Austria, is due in January. Next season, the $2.5 million production of Prokofiev's ''War and Peace'' that Mr. Vilar underwrote at the Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg comes to the Met, having been seen at Covent Garden in London and at La Scala in Milan, all on his tab.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vilar has not been shy about demanding displays of gratitude commensurate with such gifts. At the Met, for example, an operagoer may now sit in the Vilar Grand Tier or dine at the pricey Vilar Grand Tier Restaurant. As a result, he has become an easy target for critical barbs, particularly in Europe, where the twin traditions of private philanthropy and the aggrandizement of donors have been dormant since the days of Ludwig II of Bavaria, but lately in the United States as well. ''If this less-than-reticent entrepreneur wishes to compel his beneficiaries to splash his name all over their buildings and his face in their programs, fair enough,'' an unnamed critic wrote with thinly veiled hostility in The Wall Street Journal last month. ''He has certainly paid his dues -- and everybody else's as well.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Joseph Volpe, the Met's general manager, said recently that ''if he's not our biggest donor, he surely will be in no time.''</p>
        <p>And that's just the Met. Last month, Mr. Vilar held a news conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., with the tenor Placido Domingo and the conductor Valery Gergiev, at which he announced $24 million in gifts to the Los Angeles Opera, where Mr. Domingo is the artistic director, and the Kirov Opera and Ballet, which Mr. Gergiev directs. Last season, Mr. Vilar contributed $17 million toward refurbishing the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.</p>
        <p>Nor does he confine his largess to opera. Carnegie Hall is on Mr. Vilar's gift list for $5.6 million, some to restore the Seventh Avenue facade, some to support five years of Vienna Philharmonic visits. Unfazed by politics, musical or otherwise, he has given $6 million to the Salzburg Festival; he scoffs at the notion of boycotting the festival because of Jorg Haider's ascent to power in Austria. And as starry singers like Hans Sotin and Waltraud Meier were bailing out of the Bayreuth Festival in Germany after disputes with Wolfgang Wagner, the festival's embattled director, Mr. Vilar offered to pay for a production of ''Tannhauser'' in 2002, a gift that reportedly helped keep Mr. Wagner in power.</p>
        <p>More personalized gifts spring from Mr. Vilar's deep pockets as well. Having spent $10 million to build the Vilar Center for the Arts in Beaver Creek, Col., where he maintains one of his nine homes, Mr. Vilar provides an annual $1 million for artists' fees. Similarly, he spends $2 million a year on the Vilar Distinguished Artists Series at his alma mater, Washington and Jefferson College, in Washington, Pa., so that students can attend classical-music performances at no charge.</p>
        <p>And then there's the small change: grants of less than $1 million to John Eliot Gardiner's Monteverdi Choir (for its Bach Pilgrimage cantata series), the Lyric Opera of Chicago (to import Handel's ''Alcina'' from the Paris Opera) and Mr. Domingo's traveling Operalia vocal competition (which gives an Alberto Vilar Award).</p>
        <p>All told, Mr. Vilar has given or pledged about $150 million to musical organizations in recent seasons. In return, the organizations that have received his largest grants have been glorifying him on plaques and building facades, in program books and even advertisements. In addition to the Vilar Grand Tier at the Met, there is the Vilar Floral Hall, a restored Victorian structure at Covent Garden. In Carnegie Hall's season prospectus, the hall's board ''gratefully acknowledges the generosity of Alberto Vilar'' beneath each of the three Vienna Philharmonic program listings. At the Salzburg Festival this year, his photograph greeted festivalgoers as they entered the main hall. Both Salzburg and the Kirov now devote a page in their program books to him, complete with color photographs.</p>
        <p>RODNEY MILNES, reviewing the Salzburg Festival for The Times of London in August, noted that ''the ubiquitous Alberto Vilar seems to have moved in in a big way,'' and lampooned the program book's tribute page. ''I suppose it's good to have the price tags for such things established,'' he wrote, ''but it's starting to look as though the future of opera will depend on the whim of a Cuban-American stock market investor with a love of music.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Vilar's view, such criticism misses the point.</p>
        <p>''I think the single most important reason for recognition is to set an example to other potential donors,'' he said. ''When you have your name on a building, it says, 'Here's a world-class person who is giving money, and he chose us.' Isn't that a message?</p>
        <p>''People say, 'Oh, rich guy, he's got to be pampered.' I think that's so unfair. You've taken Finance 102. What is the positive impact of my gifts? More people see opera. Costs are down. Productions are better. More people are trained. And for somebody to take a cheap shot at someone for having his name on the wall, that really gets my dander up. I think it's insane. It's destructive. It's perverse.''</p>
        <p>Yet for all Mr. Vilar's insistence that the required recognition is meant to set an example, there is a hefty measure of self-congratulatory machismo in his enumeration of his gifts, and he clearly enjoys his place at the head of the parade. An hourlong discussion at the spacious Park Avenue offices of his firm, Amerindo Investment Advisors, was speckled with reminders that his contributions are unsurpassed.</p>
        <p>''We don't have data,'' he said, ''but I think anyone will tell you that I'm the largest supporter of classical music, opera and ballet in the world.'' He is, he noted, ''the biggest donor in the history of the Salzburg Festival'' as well as ''the largest single contributor'' to Covent Garden's reconstruction. He gave ''the first gift ever to Bayreuth'' and is waging ''a one-man campaign overseas to bring private philanthropy to Europe.'' Of the Kirov production that is coming to the Met, he said: ''This 'War and Peace': $2.5 million, great opera. It will be shown in less than 18 months at four of the top houses in the world, paid for by one guy.''</p>
        <p>Gerard Mortier, the artistic director of the Salzburg Festival, doesn't regard Mr. Vilar's desire for recognition as a problem.</p>
        <p>''No, no, no, no,'' Mr. Mortier said of reports that Mr. Vilar had demanded that the festival replace his entrance-hall picture with a bust. ''He always wanted a picture, and for me this is fine. If he wanted a bust, that would be O.K. with me, too. I don't care. What I care about is that the right productions are supported and that we can do new things.</p>
        <p>''In Salzburg, we have people who will support only Baroque music or Mozart concertos. And for me this is much more dubious than Alberto asking to have his picture in the hall. People like Alberto, and also Betty Freeman, support my entire policy and make no conditions. And that makes a lot possible.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vilar does have priorities. He is, for example, increasingly interested in underwriting productions that will travel to several cities. The productions of ''Doktor Faust'' and ''War and Peace'' are cases in point, and in making his recent gifts to the Los Angeles Opera and the Kirov, he encouraged them to build productions that can be shared.</p>
        <p>He is also passionate about the training of young artists. He makes an annual gift to the Met to support the Lindemann Young Artist Development Program. He is paying for a similar program at the Kirov. Part of his gift to the Los Angeles Opera is earmarked for young artists, and he is about to announce a $10 million young artists' program at Covent Garden.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vilar professes an interest, too, in ''seeding the market,'' making opera accessible to future fans. To that end, he is buying a multi language form of the seat-back libretto system the Met uses, for several European houses, starting with Covent Garden, Salzburg and the Vienna State Opera. He is also negotiating to buy a share in Figaro Systems, the company that makes the titles.</p>
        <p>''He likes the idea of his money going farther and supporting more organizations,'' said Michael Kaiser, who recently resigned as executive director of Covent Garden and becomes president of the Kennedy Center in Washington in February. ''He has certain priorities, concepts and ideas about what he wants to do. It's not just about buying the prettiest package we can buy this week.''</p>
        <p>IF Mr. Vilar's philanthropy has made him ubiquitous lately, only five years ago hardly anyone in the classical-music world knew his name. Born in Newark in 1940, the son of a Cuban sugar executive, he spent his first nine years in Cuba and the next nine in Puerto Rico. By the time he was 10, he had developed a fascination with classical music, and he dreamed of becoming a conductor, a career his father discouraged. Mr. Vilar moved to Pennsylvania to study economics at Washington and Jefferson.</p>
        <p>After two years in the United States Army, he worked briefly for Citibank before becoming a portfolio manager for private investment firms, and in the late 60's, he earned a master's degree in economics from Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y. In the 70's, he became convinced of the economic promise of nascent computer technology companies, and since his employers did not share that enthusiasm, he and a partner started Amerindo. Thanks to his prescient stock picks -- he bought Microsoft, Cisco Systems, America Online and Yahoo when they were start-ups -- Amerindo now manages about $10 billion.</p>
        <p>Along the way, Mr. Vilar became a billionaire. (He would not disclose his net worth.) And he adopted a jet-set existence, dividing his business time between New York and London; he thinks nothing of crossing the Atlantic to catch performances. In New York, Mr. Vilar, who is divorced, maintains a two-floor, 30-room pied-a-terre on the East Side, complete with replicas of the Met's rising chandeliers.</p>
        <p>But he has made a point of sharing his wealth, and the arts are not his only cause. After his left arm was shattered in a skiing accident in 1996 and reconstructed at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, he donated $12 million to establish the Alberto Vilar Center for Research of the Hand and the Upper Extremity at the hospital. And besides covering the concert series at Washington and Jefferson, he paid for the school's $28 million Vilar Center for Technology, a computer-science facility. Now under negotiation are educational projects that may cost him $100 million and proposals from several hospitals. Within three years, he said, his donations to educational and health-care institutions will equal those for music.</p>
        <p>How does he deal with all this, run a business and still have time to catch about 100 opera performances a year?</p>
        <p>''I guess there's no question that I'm highly motivated,'' he said. ''I have my company, which is 12 hours a day, five days a week. And how I do it is, first, I have a multimillion-dollar salaried expense for staffers who take care of my philanthropies. While I'm talking to you, there are six people around the world running up the meter doing things for me. Second, this is my life. I don't play golf. I don't go bowling. I go to performances. And third, I don't have any kiddies. These projects in music, education and health care are my kiddies. Music is my family, and it's my way to socialize.''</p>
        <p>While his musical tastes lean toward the standard repertory, he is quick to note that he has nothing against unusual opera. But he is cautious about it. Mr. Mortier, of Salzburg, once took him to see Messiaen's opera, ''St. Francois d'Assise,'' in a vain attempt to persuade him to underwrite performances at the Lincoln Center Festival. Still, he has paid for productions outside the standard repertory, like ''Doktor Faust,''  ''War and Peace'' and ''Alcina.'' Charles Kaye, a London arts consultant who helps arrange Mr. Vilar's donations, pointed out that the Salzburg gift helped cover the new-music series as well as new opera productions.</p>
        <p>''I will tell you, his taste is more advanced than that of most Americans,'' Mr. Mortier said. ''He is very open-minded. He listens. He wants to discover new music and new stagings. When Robert Wilson came to New York with his production of 'Lohengrin,' Alberto was one of the few who liked it.''</p>
        <p>Because operatic philanthropy has come to occupy such a central part of his life, Mr. Vilar is irked by the biting remarks directed at him in the press. And increasingly, the kind of criticism leveled by Mr. Milnes has cropped up in the American press as well. That unsigned article in The Wall Street Journal last month echoed Mr. Milnes's worry about opera being subject to Mr. Vilar's ''whim,'' accusing him of using his wealth to ''manipulate world opera,'' with the Bayreuth gift as a case in point.</p>
        <p>He has been known to flex his economic muscle. When the San Francisco Opera was searching for a general director to succeed Lotfi Mansouri next season, Mr. Vilar let it be known that he was interested in two candidates: Mr. Mortier, who is relinquishing his Salzburg post next year, and Sarah Billinghurst, the Met's assistant manager for artistic matters, whose previous job was at the San Francisco company. By his own account, Mr. Vilar told the company that ''if either one of them went there, they could count on my support.'' When Pamela Rosenberg, the artistic director of the Stuttgart Opera in Germany, was chosen instead, he made the Los Angeles Opera his principal West Coast beneficiary.</p>
        <p>But the fear that Mr. Vilar will make the opera world his personal plaything may be overstated. He is an enthusiast at heart and is in awe of the singers, conductors and directors who put opera on the stage.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't interfere artistically,'' said Mr. Kaiser, formerly of Covent Garden. ''He has never said a word to me about what we should be doing or not doing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vilar's own example of his hands-off policy is the Met's ''Traviata.'' He underwrote it partly in the hope of seeing Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu in the lead roles, as originally planned. But when a dispute led Mr. Volpe to withdraw the singers' contracts, Mr. Vilar neither interceded nor threatened to withdraw his support. His laissez-faire approach stands in stark contrast to the demands made by Sybil Harrington, his predecessor as the Met's biggest contributor, who placed artistic conditions on her support.</p>
        <p>''It's not that kind of relationship,'' Mr. Volpe said. ''Sybil would say: 'I'll give my money if you hire this director or that director. I won't give you my money if you hire so and so.'' There's none of that from Alberto. He is the perfect underwriter in that sense. He doesn't come in to look at drawings. He sees the productions when everyone else does, and he's as nervous about them as everyone else is. I don't know anybody like him, and I don't mean that in a negative way.''</p>
        <p>That said, Mr. Volpe questions Mr. Vilar's theory that splashy expressions of recognition are necessary to lure new donors.</p>
        <p>''I'm on the fence about it,'' said Mr. Volpe, who has been fending off suggestions from both the Met's board and its development department that donors of new productions should take curtain calls at the premieres and that their names should be included both on advertising posters and in the electronic titles.</p>
        <p>''There are some people who give a lot of money and who don't want credit,'' Mr. Volpe said. ''If you look back, in the last two or three decades a lot of money has come to the Met from people who do not wish to have their picture, credit and all those things. I do agree that he should get credit, that one should recognize what he is doing. And I think we have made some changes here to do that.</p>
        <p>''But you know,'' he said, pushing a copy of the Kirov program, opened to the full-page tribute to Mr. Vilar, across his desk, ''I don't think there's any likelihood that this is going to happen at the Met.''</p>
        <p>Would he refuse Mr. Vilar's request for a page in the program book?</p>
        <p>''I didn't say that,'' he replied. ''I'm saying that things take time here. So the likelihood of this happening while I'm still in this job is very low.''</p>
