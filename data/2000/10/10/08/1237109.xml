        <p>GABRIEL'S  BAR AND RESTAURANT  **  [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 956-4600; 11 West 60th Street, between Broadway and Columbus Avenue; $$$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Great big portions of Tuscan food and friendly service are the hallmarks of this restaurant. Appetizers include wood-grilled portobello over chopped radicchio drizzled with ''olio santo,'' a spicy mix of olive oil, hot peppers and garlic; eggplant and chickpea soup topped with a garlicky puree of chickpeas; and mussels steamed with white wine, tomato, garlic and hot pepper. Main dishes include potato gnocchi with ''pomodoro scoppiato,'' a burnt garlic and fresh cherry tomato sauce; pork tenderloin with a Sicilian Agro Dolci made with tomato, orange and vinegar, served with roasted potatoes, eggplant and corn on the cob; salmon fillet in a poppy seed crust; and baby chicken marinated with buttermilk and rosemary. (Review: 2/4/ 94; New York Today: April 1998)</p>
        <p>JEAN GEORGES  ****  [Rating: Four Stars]  (212) 299-3900; Trump International Tower, 1 Central Park West, between 60th and 61st Streets; $$$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The dining room is a glass box filled with fabulous aromas as waiters carve meats and ladle soups at the table. Appetizers include crisp soft shell crab with toasted brioche, caper mustard dressing and potato-tomato salad; broiled shrimp salad with avocado, tomato and Champagne beurre blanc; and foie gras terrine with green peppercorn and wild mushroom. Entrees include baked skate with caper-hazelnut crust and savoy cabbage; roasted lobster with sweet corn, young garlic and purple potatoes; and lamb noisette breaded with artichoke, fava beans and black olive. (Review: 6/6/ 97)</p>
        <p>LA BOITE EN BOIS  ++  (212) 874-2705; 75 West 68th Street, between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue; $$$$; no smoking; cash or personal check only.</p>
        <p>Pleasing, affordable bistro fare is offered here in a cozy brick-and-wood dining room. Appetizers include seafood crepe with a tomato coulis; French string beans and wild mushroom salad; a salad of endive and French chicory with walnuts; and home-cured smoked salmon with a chives sauce. Main dishes include scallops and shrimps with ginger; filet of snapper baked in parchment paper and saffron sauce; grilled quails on a bed of cranberry beans; and grilled veal chops with apple calvados. (Article: 6/9/00)</p>
        <p>NICK AND TONI'S CAFE  **  [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 496-4000; 100 West 67th Street, between Broadway and Columbus Avenue; $$$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This Mediterranean restaurant fits so seamlessly into its neighborhood that it seems to have been there forever. Current appetizers include arugula salad with roasted Vidalia onion, feta and warm smoked bacon; fennel and pink grapefruit salad with goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette; and grilled wild boar sausage with mustard lentils and sauteed spinach. Entrees include grilled marinated baby lamb rack with horseradish mashed potato and broccoli rape; fresh cod, roasted over braised greens with haricot vert Provencal; and carrot risotto with bay scallops and caramelized onions.  (Review: 11/12/97)</p>
        <p>PICHOLINE  ***  [Rating: Three Stars]  (212) 724-8585; 35 West 64th Street, between Broadway and Central Park West; $$$$; smoking at the bar and cafe; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The daily specials and whole fish for two are particularly impressive at this Mediterranean French restaurant. Best of all, however, is the cheese cart. Entrees include wild striped bass with heirloom tomato salad, raw tomato coulis and basil aioli; stuffed loin of rabbit with pappardelle and sage; braised breast of veal with summer root vegetables and potato puree; and roast Peking duck with grain pancakes and fig compote.
