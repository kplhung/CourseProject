        <p>Bishop James McHugh, the spiritual leader of Long Island's 1.4 million Catholics and the head of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, said last week that candidates for political office who supported abortion would not be permitted to speak at candidates' forums held in church buildings.</p>
        <p>The bishop's order prompted Catholic Charities, a church agency, to cancel three candidate forums that were scheduled at churches in Syosset, Bohemia and Wyandanch.</p>
        <p>The Syosset event, scheduled for St. Edward the Confessor Church, was to have been a debate between representatives of the Senate candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton, an abortion rights advocate and non-Catholic, and Rick Lazio, a Catholic who said last week he supported F.D.A. approval of the abortion-inducing drug RU-486. Neither position is supported by the Catholic Church.</p>
        <p>Bishop McHugh, the diocesan head since 1998, said last week he had issued similar directives while bishop of the Diocese of Camden in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''It is not the purpose of the church to provide candidates with a platform where they can set forth their pro-abortion views or explanations thereof,'' Bishop McHugh said in a telephone interview last week.</p>
        <p>In a directive to monsignors and priests dated Sept. 21, Bishop McHugh said that during the election period, there should be ''no mention, for or against, any candidate for public office from the pulpit.''</p>
        <p>The directive said that ''those who are pro-abortion or claim to be personally opposed to abortion but unwilling to integrate their moral principles with civic responsibilities'' should not be given leadership posts or invited to speak at graduations, lectures ''or other public events where the invited speaker is given positive recognition or approval.''</p>
