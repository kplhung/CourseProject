        <p>MARY FRANK is a quintessential 20th-century artist forever on the brink of her own millennial revelation. So much was she shaped by midcentury modernist culture -- its seriousness and anxiety, its traumas and resurgent longings for transcendence -- that her work, which has moved people to tears and elicited rapturous critical praise, still wants exegesis today.

        <p>A retrospective show is for a visual artist what a memoir is for a writer, a record of self-formation and a hedge against oblivion. But for viewers who like to look for subtexts, the interest can be in the way the artist turns life experience into general statement.

        <p>MARY FRANK is a quintessential 20th-century artist forever on the brink of her own millennial revelation. So much was she shaped by midcentury modernist culture -- its seriousness and anxiety, its traumas and resurgent longings for transcendence -- that her work, which has moved people to tears and elicited rapturous critical praise, still wants exegesis today. Now two retrospective shows of her paintings -- at the D.C. Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Ave., through Saturday, and the Neuberger Museum in Purchase, N.Y., through Jan. 7 -- provide an occasion.</p>
        <p>A retrospective show is for a visual artist what a memoir is for a writer, a record of self-formation and a hedge against oblivion. But for viewers who like to look for subtexts, the interest can be in the way the artist turns life experience into general statement. I asked Ms. Frank whether she objected to people drawing their own conclusions from her work, making possibly bogus or sentimental readings of it. Is critical empathy a professional misdemeanor?</p>
        <p>''Impossible! No!'' she answered heatedly. ''I read other people's art the same way myself. When the work is finished, it's in the world -- whatever the world is -- and people can enter it on their own terms. In some African countries, when you order a robe, the tailor leaves a part undone so the buyer can finish it, make it his own.''</p>
        <p>The paintings here do have passages ''undone,'' in the sense of being open to interpretation. Human beings and animals appear in various land- and skyscapes, but the style is far from realistic save in passages of exalted brushwork where a bent plant stem, a woman's tilted face or a lifted hand seem studied from nature.</p>
        <p>''Where does experience go?'' Ms. Frank wondered aloud when we met at D.C. Moore, the gallery that has long represented her. She was in the process of hanging the show. (Later we also met in Purchase.) The side panels of several large triptyches were closed like the wings of birds. (Viewers are urged to open and close these ''interactive'' works.) Other paintings leaned against the wall. Now and then Ms. Frank would send one off to another spot. There was no program for the hanging, not chronology or subject matter, only her sense for what belonged where.</p>
        <p>''I've been working for two, three years on this group,'' she said. ''And 15 years and more on painting.'' Where indeed had experience gone? ''Into the work,'' she answered herself. In the work of no living artist is the drama of that intermixing more vivid and instructive.</p>
        <p>The paintings were improvised, she said, worked and reworked as the spirit moved her. From her early days, I knew, this artist has indeed improvised like an angel -- with paper, plaster, crayons, wood, clay, dance, music, circus and theater design, book illustrations -- partly for the delight of leaving marks on the world's skin. The canvases she has produced are alive with paint, thin or thick, scumbled or flowing, in harsh or pale tonalities. Still, ''improvised'' was a puzzle.</p>
        <p>For nothing here seemed haphazard or random in the sense used today. Nor was there irony or humor in these intensely serious images of flying, tumbling, clutching, rushing women; figures in flames or whirlwinds; hybrid animal-humans and owl-faced leaping boys. In what world might this turmoil of oceans, mountains, trees, clouds, snowfields and cracked earth planes find a home? Pods of space float loose, and characters assume frozen poses as if they had leaped into the artist's mind in a flash of recollection. Only certain works seemed anchored in time, space and meaning. In one of these, a human skeleton on all fours like an animal bends to forage among flowers.</p>
        <p>The works seem emotionally driven, obsessive in their intimation of catastrophic events not long past and offstage. ''I'd say I purposefully improvise,'' Ms. Frank said, trying to explain, ''but you can't do that purposefully! And I need a discernible image. I may work with abstract colors and lines, but it's hard for me to leave a painting if I haven't a clarified image.</p>
        <p>''And there are so many ways to deal with the human image!'' she continued. ''You look at a painted figure. The figure is frontal or not. You stand and gaze at it and see other forms and shapes. I try to let it go its own way, but it's hell each time. I wrote in my notebook: 'Draw from life! Observe!' Only eight pages later, I found myself writing: 'Stop drawing from life! Draw from your head!' But the relationships carry from work to work. In one, there's an owl next to a boy's head. It came into that painting late! The boy was alone looking into the void. But the figure needed some action, and the owl appeared. It appears elsewhere, too, always there, beside the head.''</p>
        <p>That these works compose a visual language built on a grammar of images is an insight others have had. ''Neruda's words, I think, are 'the grammar of regret.' '' Ms. Frank said. Could she name verbs in such a language? ''I think of the shift between present and past tense of some verbs,'' she reflected. ''Is and was. Do and did. You say, 'A person is here, here in the world.' Then, 'That person was here in the world.' What a gulf lies between those two words! Then, what word could you use for seeing through into other spaces? Seeing into from outside? Maybe there is no such word.''</p>
        <p>I suggested ''imagine''; she returned with ''remember.''</p>
        <p>Nouns were easier, for they came with associations: ''Trees, clouds, poppies, that flower'' -- she pointed to a yellow one with open petals -- ''isn't any particular flower, but poppies are. I grow them in my garden. Also, mountains -- I live in the Catskills -- and apertures. Creeks and creatures. A human head on a deer body. The centaur, lion-women. I've always drawn lion women.''</p>
        <p>I asked: ''And ships?'' She answered: ''Yes! Shipwrecks. Turmoil. Horizons . . . and always, memory.''</p>
        <p>I asked, ''What of the women's faces with a line coming out of the open mouth?''</p>
        <p>She answered: ''I've titled that one 'Voice.' But I think the image is really just breathing. Being alive. Because a line can carry so much information. In Chinese painting, a lotus on its upright stem is a positive symbol of perfection. But when it dies, the stem breaks like a branch and the line becomes calligraphic.''</p>
        <p>So calligraphy and certain figures carry information, as if in a text or scroll: some millennial ''Odyssey'' or ''Purgatorio'' or ''Magic Flute,'' composed by this artist in working meditation on the experiences of a 20th-century life -- losses, exiles, deaths and new lives -- that live in her mind.</p>
        <p>An artist's beginnings hold clues to the mature imagery. Mary Frank was born in England and sent as a child to a wartime retreat where, she once told me, the bomb shelter lay under rose gardens. At night, the children filed underground with gas masks around their shoulders to wait for the all-clear. After the war, she sailed to this country with her mother, an artist. By then, fate and politics had irrevocably parted her from her English  father, a musicologist.</p>
        <p>In intervening years, Mary Frank seems not to have foraged directly among those unforgettable scenes. But by the mid-1970's she had broken through to the image that still defines her for many people. The language then was clay, figures fired in sections in her kiln and reassembled into standing or floor pieces of great drama and technical finesse. They represented Persephone, Daphne and other heroines of a lost underworld.</p>
        <p>Whatever it was about the process of handwork with clay that released those great images of healing earth spirits and gave them their majestic formal refinement, the same is not true for Ms. Frank's paintings. No single image has emerged as the essential one in such a welter of events and beings. ''I studied painting so little,'' she says now. ''I'd have loved to study with El Greco or Bonnard or a calligrapher.'' But there is a line that connects the years and supports the exploratory fervor of the painting. For many artists, especially those born abroad who endured the war years, the arc of experience began in fear and trembling, passed through trauma and recovery, and still runs forward in places graced by benevolent nature. Mary Frank's vision culminates in great washes of azure blue and the serene geometries of snow-covered mountains in ''Migration'' (at the Neuberger) and ''Twice'' (at D.C. Moore). These signal a state of mind some people might call mystic; others, esthetic composure.</p>
        <p>THERE is more. Undeniably, sadness, as the artist put it, is a dominant mood here. On a notebook page in the Neuberger catalog is a line, ''Will I always be haunted by my children?'' Numbers of mothers in this and any other era ask the same question. But Mary Frank said before we parted:  ''Aside from what other people think, I look for deep learning in seeing the show. And what I could learn is not necessarily positive. Some things may be overworked.'' She leaned back in her chair. ''Because I also like to laugh. I hope some part of the work is joyful. Aspects of the flowers and so on. But I can't judge that. I wouldn't be surprised if somebody said, 'I can't see it.' But engaging with ideas isn't sad. It's life.''</p>
