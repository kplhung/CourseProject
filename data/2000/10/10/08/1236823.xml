        <p>THE JOURNEY OF</p>
        <p>MARTIN NADAUD</p>
        <p>A Life and Turbulent Times.</p>
        <p>By Gillian Tindall.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 310 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>St. Martin's Press. $23.95.</p>
        <p>''In the evening when the Chinese wall was finished / Where did the masons go?'' Bertolt Brecht asks in ''A Worker Reads History.'' For Paris until the closing decades of the 19th century, the answer is clear. Stonemasons of the Creuse, part of the Limousin region of central France, setting off in early spring and returning home for autumn harvest, helped build the Pantheon, the Palais Bourbon and Napoleon's Arc de Triomphe, and when their ranks peaked in Paris in the 1850's and 60's, those not imprisoned or exiled as republican radicals gave form to the dreams of Napoleon III. Without Creuse masons and other migrant workers, Paris would have remained a warren of squat medieval buildings and dark fetid roads.</p>
        <p>In 1830, on the eve of his 15th birthday, a fledgling mason, Martin Nadaud, left his native canton of Pontarion for the first time. His father and uncle, itinerant builders, accompanied him to Paris, covering the 200 miles in four days, three at a quick march and one by coach from Orleans, pausing along the way at farms and inns where the Nadauds and their countrymen had stopped for generations. The customary patterns of migration continued in the capital: like their Limousin neighbors and their counterparts from the Auvergne, the Creusois populated distinct communities on the right bank, across the Seine from the le de la Cite; they spoke provincial patois, worked in close-knit teams, frequented the same cafes and boardinghouses and, for the most part, showed little interest in Parisian affairs. As Gillian Tindall puts it in this splendid study of a man of many worlds, ''It was not so much a matter of leaving the Creuse as of taking it to Paris with them.''</p>
        <p>But the city worked its magic, and ''The Journey of Martin Nadaud'' charts the life of a mason who emerged as an exception to the historic rule. First at home, at his father's urging, and then in the capital, he learned French; he also tutored his wife and sisters in the language and, during late-night sessions, many of his fellow masons. Reared on Creusois chestnuts, potatoes and rye bread, he developed in the city a taste for meat, wine and national politics. An anticlerical republican committed to workers' rights and industrial progress -- When the building trade is going well, all is going well,'' he said -- he forged friendships with the social reformer Louis Blanc and the utopian socialist etienne Cabet, championed the 1848 revolution (in its early phase, before the hopes of February gave way to the bloodshed of June) and became a member of parliament during the short-lived Second Republic. ''Stocky and pugnacious,'' the celebrated deputy in a worker's smock was, for many admirers, a possible presidential candidate, though, to be sure, never more than a long shot.</p>
        <p>''French politics run down the generations like messages in seaside rock,'' Tindall tells us. Like his father, who revered the first Napoleon, Nadaud admired Napoleon's nephew, the populist advocate of trade unions, the crusader against poverty. But this Napoleon disappointed his early allies on the left, as his uncle had done, and after election as president carried on another Bonapartist custom. Staging a coup in 1851, he scuttled the Second Republic, proclaimed himself emperor and set out to rid France of ''red'' rabble, so prominent, it seemed, among the dangerous laboring classes -- including a good number of itinerant workers.</p>
        <p>Arrested for sedition and ''exiled in perpetuity,'' Martin Nadaud, now a widower, fled to England, where he waited out the Second Empire's 18 years. He worked on London building sites, landed a job near the booming textile town of Manchester (with the help, Tindall's detection suggests, of Friedrich Engels) and then turned to teaching French at a Wimbledon school.</p>
        <p>Down from the mason's scaffold for the last time, he enjoyed visits to the British Museum, that gathering place of foreign exiles, and may have studied alongside Karl Marx. The record is silent, but Tindall is right to conclude that Nadaud would reject the clarion call of class struggle, ''the whole idea of . . . fellow citizens of the same country pitted against one another.'' Instead, he gravitated toward the politics of William Gladstone, that ''humane, reforming, bourgeois liberal.'' Put off by the excesses of 1848 and the Paris Commune of 1870, Nadaud, like many other revolutionaries whose lives spanned the century, migrated to the center, and after Louis Napoleon's fall pinned his hopes on the compromise of the Third Republic.</p>
        <p>He also reaped its rewards. Home again in the Creuse, the native son, born in a stone cottage built by his father and grandfather, moved into a Renaissance chateau and served as prefect, France's highest departmental post. Tindall drops the curtain at that crowning moment in 1871 when Nadaud's life, if not his times, turned less turbulent. We are left to wonder how the old revolutionary reacted to the young republic's upheavals, to Boulangism (in fact he opposed its reactionary drift), the Panama scandal and the Dreyfus case, which had spiraled into an international affair by 1898, the year of Nadaud's death.</p>
        <p>Gillian Tindall has brought to life a worker, politician and teacher whose ''silhouette'' flits ''through respectful footnotes in the pages of social histories.'' And she has done so with the same enthusiasm for the hunt, for tracking her subject's ''scent,'' that she brought several years ago to ''Celestine,'' her account of another villager in the central French hinterlands. With a memoir Nadaud wrote in his twilight years as her foundation text, she draws on archives and a trove of unpublished letters to fill in the stories left untold, or told with embellishment. She stumbles, but rarely: liberties are taken with translations of popular verse, and if wolves and witches, rampant in the rural French imagination, had indeed departed from the ''world of Jane Austen,'' they still roamed the English countryside beyond Bath.</p>
        <p>''The Journey of Martin Nadaud,'' neither a definitive biography nor a scholarly history, is an imaginative evocation of a lost world and a little-known hero praised by George Sand as ''so good, so gentle, so wise.'' It is also a reminder that today's migrants in France, more often from North Africa than the Limousin, speak in foreign tongues, live in distinct neighborhoods and dream of home, much like the ''boy who set off for Paris in the dawn because he had no choice.''</p>
