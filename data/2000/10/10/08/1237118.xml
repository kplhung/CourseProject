        <p>IT'S 11 a.m., her private yoga session is over and she's dressed to the nines in a beige gabardine Oscar de la Renta suit and brown hat, a triple strand of pearls gracing her neck. The monogrammed handkerchief with which she occasionally dabs at sniffles is the only sign that she braved a cold rain the night before to attend the Rose Garden dinner-dance at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Over tea, she sits in the library of her Park Avenue apartment, examining a printout of her daily schedule. There will be lunch at Cafe Boulud, a trustees' meeting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and in the evening a Louis Armstrong concert at Carnegie Hall, followed by a benefit dinner where flashes will pop upon her arrival.</p>
        <p>She is Brooke Astor, the paparazzi-worthy 98-year-old social whirlwind.</p>
        <p>''I truly can't keep up with her,'' said Jolie Hirsch, Mrs. Astor's 26-year-old personal secretary. ''There's nothing routine about her life besides the fact that it's booked. She puts my social stamina to shame.''</p>
        <p>By virtue of her longevity, Mrs. Astor is the unofficial queen of a quartet of New York social figures in their 90's who are some of the city's fiercest partygoers. While many who make it to such an age are confined to nursing homes or can't be bothered to keep up with the times -- much less to keep themselves up -- these four women are dolling up and dancing the night away. Besides Mrs. Astor, they are Eleanor Lambert, 96, a fashion publicist who still goes to a Midtown office daily; the fashion designer Pauline Trigere, 91, whose legacy has been revived by the likes of John Bartlett this season; and the singer and arts patron Kitty Carlisle Hart, who celebrated her 90th birthday last month by belting out four songs before a roomful of cheering admirers.</p>
        <p>''I would like to be like them but I don't know if I'm going to make it,'' said Lauren Ezersky, the host of ''Behind the Velvet Ropes'' on the Style Channel, who put her own age in the early 40's. ''I get 10 invitations every day to parties. I'm exhausted. I'm tired. I've got to sleep. I don't know what these ladies do. I see them out all the time. They're dressed. They make an effort. Whatever drugs they're on, pass them along.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Astor insisted that her only aid to longevity consisted of a lifetime of moderation in eating and drinking, and that keeping busy was the key to enduring youth and the reason she has never had a face-lift. ''I feel the good Lord would feel he has to take me away if I wasn't doing anything,'' she said cheerfully in her bibelot-filled library. ''If you just sit around and do nothing, you're boring to other people. You've got to keep up with the times and what's going on in the world.''</p>
        <p>When she is not at her weekend house in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., she goes out every day and night in the city, changing from one up-to-date outfit to the next, doing her own makeup, hobnobbing with the old and young alike.</p>
        <p>''She's very coquettish,'' said Oscar de la Renta. ''The worst thing is for her to go to a dinner and sit next to a woman. She wants to sit next to two men to flirt.''</p>
        <p>Although she closed the Vincent Astor Foundation in 1997, ceding her role as the doyenne of New York philanthropy after giving away some $200 million, Mrs. Astor is still on the boards of the New York Public Library and the Rockefeller Foundation, as well as the Metropolitan Museum. And over the past year, she has contributed two articles about manners to Vanity Fair.</p>
        <p>In a city that never sleeps and where polite society still has a prominent place, these senior social butterflies are the ultimate role models. Melissa Ceria, 27, who covers the partygoing rounds of bright young things for Harper's Bazaar, keeps a photograph of Mrs. Astor on her desk as an emblem of the grace, elegance and style sought by the younger generation with social aspirations.</p>
        <p>Nan Kempner, who has herself just turned 70, said: ''It all boils down to the old story of putting your best foot forward. It's discipline. All of these women think about how people perceive them.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lambert held her annual open house during Fashion Week last month, as she has done for nearly six decades, at her Fifth Avenue apartment overlooking Central Park. She has lived there since she was 39, when she married, Seymour Berkson, the publisher of The New York Journal-American, who died in 1959.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lambert, who organized the precursors of New York's fashion weeks in the early 1940's, shortly after starting the International Best-Dressed List to promote American designers, appeared resplendent in a turban, a chunky tribal necklace and a red tunic and pants.</p>
        <p>Feasting on baked ham and macaroni and cheese, the crowd of old-timers included Ruth Findley, publisher of the Fashion Calendar, and the seemingly ageless white-haired model known as Carmen. Dressed in designers like Geoffrey Beene and Arnold Scaasi, the women had little interest in the 80's-inspired trends in the spring 2001 collections -- they were still wearing the originals. There were no Jimmy Choo stilettos or Prada bags, but there was an unexpected element of hipness.</p>
        <p>''Eleanor, why did you cover up your tattoo?'' asked Nancy Holmes, the editor at large of Worth, a financial magazine, pointing to the hostess's frail ankle, where the outline of a star -- a vestige of wilder days with Dorothy Parker in the 1930's -- showed faintly beneath sheer black hosiery.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lambert didn't answer: she was busy memorizing the number of a reporter from Houston. ''Vanity Fair told me I should have this speed dial with the numbers written down,'' Mrs. Lambert said. ''I don't need it. I remember everything.''</p>
        <p>Graydon Carter, Vanity Fair's editor, confirmed that Mrs. Lambert, who represents clients like Joan &amp; David shoes and the designer Jackie Rogers, has the memory of an elephant. ''Eleanor is sharp as a tack,'' he said. ''She can remember a conversation she had with Clare Booth Luce 70 years ago. I have trouble remembering what happened 20 minutes ago.''</p>
        <p>Miss Trigere's fashion career dates back as far as Mrs. Lambert's. Anxious about the rise of the Nazis, she left Paris in 1936 with her husband, Lazar Radley (whose name she did not take), her two sons, her mother and her brother, and settled in New York. Because both her late father and her husband were tailors and her mother was a seamstress, Miss Trigere learned the art of dressmaking firsthand.</p>
        <p>Her legacy of striking yet simple clothes, which were worn by the Duchess of Windsor and Claudette Colbert, has been revived in the fall styles of both Mr. Bartlett and Tuleh. Winona Ryder wore one of her vintage gowns in March to the Oscars.</p>
        <p>''We're enjoying a ladylike, couture-influenced fashion moment, and her clothes look wonderful again,'' said Hamish Bowles, Vogue's European editor at large. ''The lines are clean. They're just sexy enough and just glamorous enough.''</p>
        <p>Wearing a red suit -- one of her famous dictums is, ''If you're blue, wear red'' -- Miss Trigere recently attended a party at Le Cirque for Liz Smith and her memoir, ''Natural Blonde.'' (Mrs. Astor and Mrs. Lambert were also there, but Mrs. Hart, who was invited, had sent regrets; she was on a cruise for the Theater Guild in the Greek isles, where she was performing aboard ship.)</p>
        <p>After greeting old friends like Mr. Scaasi and receiving double kisses from admirers, Miss Trigere grabbed a couple of hors d'oeuvres before dashing to her white limousine outside. On her way to a cocktail party at La Caravelle, which was celebrating its 40th anniversary, she whipped out a compact and lip liner for a touch-up.</p>
        <p>''Being seen can be a problem,'' she complained, although from her manner it was hard to believe she didn't love the attention. ''I always go with lipstick and with my hair done. I never go slouchy. My clothes are 12 years old, and that's all I wear. I've got to get into them, so I watch what I eat. That's work, too.''</p>
        <p>Plunging into the Caravelle crowd, which included Arie Kopelman, Martha Stewart and Ann Slater, Miss Trigere declined a waiter's offer of wine or Champagne. She ordered a gin and tonic. Shamelessly flirtatious, she couldn't help make a passing remark when she spotted David Patrick Columbia, a former editor of Avenue magazine. ''He's adorable,'' she said in a husky French accent, sounding like a Gallic Marlene Dietrich. ''He's too young for me.''</p>
        <p>''And she's too fast for me!'' Mr. Columbia replied, overhearing.</p>
        <p>Miss Trigere, who closed her business in 1992, until recently enjoyed the company of Julio Wertheim, a wealthy Argentine 10 years her junior. Despite her advanced age, the femme fatale in her is alive and kicking. Pamela Fiori, the editor of Town &amp; Country, recalled that at a photo shoot for the magazine this year, the photographer was trying to charm Miss Trigere -- who cautioned that if he kept it up, the two would wind up in bed together.</p>
        <p>And Harold Koda, the curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, remembered a garden party two summers ago at La Tortue, Miss Trigere's 18th-century home in Westchester County, named for her famous collection of turtle ornaments. When Mr. Koda pulled up in the driveway, Miss Trigere greeted him barefoot, with an ice-cold martini and dressed in what he recalled as ''a seductive outfit'' -- a sheer tiger-print chiffon caftan over a leopard-print bathing suit.</p>
        <p>''In New York, those who are aging don't give up,'' said Andre Jammet, who owns La Caravelle with his wife, Rita. ''It is a small city with lots of services and doormen and drivers. Everything is not too far. These women go out all the time. Many times, they come with people much younger than them. There is a chemistry here in New York that permits it. It's not the same in Paris. They go to the Riviera. Here, they are always social. They are busy. They are doing something for the city. They have a sense of duty. Voila!''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hart's sense of civic duty is legendary. In 1971, Gov. Nelson Rockefeller appointed her vice chairwoman of the New York State Council on the Arts; five years later, she became chairwoman, a position she held for 21 years. As a peripatetic arts administrator with an interest in cultural institutions great and small, she visited rural string quartets and inner-city dance troupes. She is now both the chairwoman emeritus and a board member of the arts council. Three weeks ago, for her 90th birthday -- the first time she has admitted to her real age in decades -- the Westchester Arts Network, an alliance of seven cultural institutions, gave a black-tie gala in her honor at the Neuberger Museum of Art in Purchase, N.Y.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, Mrs. Hart's companion of three years is the museum's founding patron, Roy R. Neuberger, who is 97. Addressing the crowd of arts supporters, Mr. Neuberger offered a loving toast. Mrs. Hart, in turn, gave him a big smooch, told him he was ''wicked'' and said that was why she loved him. The highlight of the evening was a performance by Mrs. Hart, who began her career in Marx Brothers movies, appeared with the Metropolitan Opera in ''Die Fledermaus'' in 1967 and as recently as two years ago turned up on the big screen (in ''Radio Days'').</p>
        <p>Stepping to the microphone, the rhinestones on her black Pauline Trigere cocktail dress glittering under the stage lights, Mrs. Hart recounted anecdotes of her days in the theater. She was friends with Richard Rodgers and Irving Berlin, and her husband was the playwright and director Moss Hart, who died in 1961. For a finale, she sang ''Here's to Life,'' a wistful song about growing older. The room, so quiet you could hear ice cubes clinking in water glasses, exploded into a standing ovation when she ended the song, arms outstretched diva style.</p>
        <p>A few days later, at her Park Avenue apartment, which was dotted with theatrical mementos and fresh flowers, Mrs. Hart made a grand entrance into the living room wearing a red silk robe, her face perfectly made up with bright red lipstick, rouge and liquid eyeliner. Her dark brunet coif, which she dyes herself with Loving Care and sets with rollers, was held in place by a generous application of hair spray.</p>
        <p>Asked the secret of her enduring youthfulness, she said: ''I practice the piano and sing every day for a half an hour. I swim two to three times a week. I get on the scale every day of my life. And I exercise.''</p>
        <p>Then she demonstrated her workout. Leaning against the back of the sofa, she put her feet together and began doing leg lifts. She pointed out that she still gets compliments on her shapely legs. Then she found her pair of five-pound weights and, holding one in each hand, raised her arms 20 times above her head.</p>
        <p>Asked how often she goes out at night, Mrs. Hart batted her lashes and grinned mischievously, exclaiming, ''Every night!''</p>
        <p>But doesn't she get tired? ''I used to,'' she said. ''But I don't have time to get tired now. There's too much to get in before I meet my maker.''</p>
