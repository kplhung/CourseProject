        <p>ON the North Fork of Long Island, there is no more precious possession than knowledge of special outdoor places not yet overwhelmed by development, government regulation or humans at play. And by this measure boaters who knew about a splendid stretch of Orient shoreline called Long Beach counted themselves rich.</p>
        <p>To those in on the secret, it was a place to which they could sail, row or motor, where families and friends came ashore for picnics on a wild, untrammeled and never-crowded beach backed by a rare red cedar forest. But the 2.5-mile-long spit of sand is also a federally designated national natural landmark and bird sanctuary inside Orient Beach State Park, and therein is the rub.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, deciding that boaters had become a serious threat to a protected natural environment, the park manager, Ray Dobbins, began an enforcement blitz that changed Long Beach abruptly for habitues like Joseph L. Townsend Jr., an insurance company owner and former mayor of Greenport.</p>
        <p>''Now I don't think anyone is on the beach for five minutes before they are kicked off,'' said Mr. Townsend, adding that in years of coming ashore he had never before seen a park ranger or any sign that boaters were doing damage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Townsend and other boaters said they had tried in vain to engage park officials in discussions about regulations that allowed hikers and birdwatchers on Long Beach while barring boaters who anchored offshore and swam or rowed dinghies to the beach.</p>
        <p>''It's an equal-access issue,'' said Mr. Townsend, who challenged parks officials to prove that boaters had disturbed the environment. ''All we want is to have some kind of regulations that allow us access too.''</p>
        <p>So strongly did he and scores of other local boaters feel about the issue that for the past three years they have boated to the beach on Labor Day to protest the crackdown, inviting arrest in order to test their exclusion in court.</p>
        <p>This Labor Day, park police accommodated them, riding out of the red cedar woods on all-terrain vehicles and swooping in by boat, video cameras rolling, to order some 60 protesters off the sand. When Mr. Townsend and four other boaters declined to leave, the police cited them for disorderly conduct.</p>
        <p>Mary D. Dorman, a lawyer in Manhattan with a home in Orient and one of those cited, said the group welcomed a chance to argue its case in the Southold Town Justice Court and, depending on how matters progressed, perhaps in higher courts. Last week the case was still in its initial phases.</p>
        <p>''We have been forced to take a stand against what appears to us to be an irrational policy,'' Ms. Dorman said. ''In theory, all of the public is invited to use the state park. The state is going to have to show why boaters who swim in to shore are treated any differently than hikers who walk on the shore.''</p>
        <p>The protesters are also raising as a defense the traditional right of public passage below mean high tide. And they are arguing that residents of Orient, whose forbears had jointly owned and managed the land that is now within the park since 1774, had intended that boating be permitted when they signed a compact in 1929 turning the 342-acre area over to the Long Island State Park Commission.</p>
        <p>State parks officials strongly defend restrictions on the 230-acre western portion of the park that includes Long Beach, which since 1980 has been designated by the Interior Department as a natural landmark.</p>
        <p>In a 1998 letter to Rob Buchanan of Greenport, a spokesman for the boaters, the state parks commissioner, Bernadette Castro, noted that the Long Beach spit had been a refuge and sanctuary for nearly half a century for wildlife including endangered birds such as osprey, piping plovers, least terns, common terns and northern harriers. In addition to the maritime red cedar forest, she said, there were other rare plants.</p>
        <p>''The entire area including the nearby waters provide an ecosystem for a diversity of fish and wildlife that must be protected,'' she said, inviting Mr. Buchanan to tour the land with a ranger to gain ''a better understanding of what we are doing to protect this fragile piece of land and why restrictions are necessary.''</p>
        <p>A ranger who conducts the Long Beach tours, Mary Laura Lamont, said she had sometimes seen the remains of small campfires and also had encountered picnickers. ''I have seen major setups with coolers, hibachis, the whole works like at Jones Beach, and that should never be allowed in a natural area,'' she said, calling Long Beach ''as good as it gets on Long Island.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan, who lives in Greenport, said the local boaters agreed that Long Beach needed protection. ''I am not saying this should be an utterly unregulated area where yahoos go out and crush the egg shells and burn down the forest,'' he said. ''There is plenty of room for regulation here. It's just that they went from a lack of any regulation at all to shutting to beach down completely.''</p>
        <p>A parks department spokesman, Randall Sawyer, said last week that no change in restrictions on boats was planned. ''Access by boat is prohibited,'' Mr. Sawyer said. But Patricia L. Acampora, whose state Assembly district includes the North Fork, said in a recent letter to Mr. Buchanan that she ''couldn't help but wonder if it's our residents or the regulators who need regulating.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dobbins, the park manager, said no arrests occurred, and that the ticketing occurred only after the police had asked the protesters three times to leave. He said he ordered the Labor Day enforcement action after boaters ''got so brazen'' that they advertised their protest in a local weekly newspaper.</p>
        <p>He said he began stepped-up enforcement three years ago because an increasing number of boaters were ignoring signs posted every 600 feet barring boats.</p>
        <p>''People were coming in with their dogs, having barbecues and swimming,'' he said. ''This area is restricted for all of that. It came to the point where we had to have some controls.''</p>
        <p>Dogs, Mr. Dobbins said, were a threat to plover and tern nesting areas. He said fire in the inaccessible area would be nearly impossible to control. Barbecuing is allowed only in a 20-acre area on the developed eastern side of the park, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dobbins said permitting entry to the park only through the main gate at the east end of the park assured public safety and environmental protection. ''When people come in back doors and side doors we lose all control and people are doing things they shouldn't be doing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The sheer difficulty of hiking over sand from the 135-car parking area to the western end of Long Beach, he said, assured that few of the park's 170,000 annual visitors made the trek, increasing protection of the reserve area. Allowing boaters access to areas few reached on foot would have disastrous results, he said.</p>
        <p>He said many of the protesters were members of a yacht club in Orient. ''They feel it's their own little beach and that they have special rights,'' Mr. Dobbins said. ''But this is a state park. There's no such thing as special rights.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan said Mr. Dobbins' attitude was outrageous. ''What is completely maddening is that they keep saying we are these elitists and that it is our private partying grounds, as if there was something wrong with taking a boat across the bay and landing on a beach for a picnic in a place where there are no obnoxious second homes or a busy road.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan said much of the problem lay with Mr. Dobbins's management style. ''This is a guy with a police mentality,'' he said. ''He is not a park ranger, he is a policeman, and he sees parks as places where people have to be policed. He runs it like a prison.''</p>
