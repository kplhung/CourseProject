        <p>1. The sight of a large piece of furniture being hoisted through the window of a New York City apartment is no big deal. The sight of an oil tank being airlifted by crane into a loft, however, might raise a few eyebrows. This was definitely the case when the 7,200-gallon tank from an oil truck arrived at Josh Morton's building just over a year ago (a, b). Can't live without a tank of your own? Morton acquired the rehabilitated tank for a mere $3,500 from Garafano Tank Service in Paterson, N.J. That's about $50,000 less than the cost of a new truck. And there's no need to worry about fumes or trace petroleum: each three-ton tank is meticulously steam-cleaned by Peter Garafano and his crew.</p>
        <p>2. If you think a tank is hard to move, imagine what it would be like to transport LOT/EK's next project: the fuselage of a 747 jumbo jet, which the firm intends to turn into a new student lounge for the University of Washington. It's understandable why the architects made the connection between the university and airplane parts: the Boeing Company was the cornerstone of Seattle's pre-Microsoft economy. Boeing worked with university engineers in the mid-1930's to create the Kirsten Wind Tunnel, shown here. The tunnel, part of the University of Washington Aeronautical Laboratory, simulates high-speed winds and played a crucial role in the development of commercial aircraft.</p>

        <p>2. If you think a tank is hard to move, imagine what it would be like to transport LOT/EK's next project: the fuselage of a 747 jumbo jet, which the firm intends to turn into a new student lounge for the University of Washington. It's understandable why the architects made the connection between the university and airplane parts: the Boeing Company was the cornerstone of Seattle's pre-Microsoft economy. Boeing worked with university engineers in the mid-1930's to create the Kirsten Wind Tunnel, shown here. The tunnel, part of the University of Washington Aeronautical Laboratory, simulates high-speed winds and played a crucial role in the development of commercial aircraft.</p>
        <p>3. Besides tractor-trailers, shipping containers, oil tanks, detergent bottles, refrigerators and municipal water tanks, LOT/EK's building materials include large quantities of industrial metal sinks. The firm recently installed two pivoting walls in the Chelsea offices of Edizioni Press, an Italian publisher, each consisting of some 20 sinks coated with a thick shell of car paint. Not only are the sinks visually arresting, but they function as storage cubbies, too.</p>
        <p>4. Champions of enclosed personal spaces, the architects mounted an installation at Manhattan's Deitch Projects two years ago that consisted of tanks morphed into cozy, individual TV-viewing chambers. The group has developed its TV-tank concept for this year's Neiman Marcus Christmas Book. For $70,000, technophiles can treat themselves to the ''Mixer,'' shown here, which is an actual cement mixer retrofitted with 12 monitors, a PlayStation 2-and-DVD player, Orgazmotron-caliber surround sound, surveillance cameras and a cushy electric-blue, rubberized-foam interior. Two people can comfortably close the hatches against the physical world in the seven-foot isolation capsule. For a copy of the Christmas Book, which costs $15, call (800) 634-6267.</p>
        <p>5. The architects at LOT/EK were afraid that the resin they wanted to pour into the catwalk grating that surrounds Morton's sleeping area -- rendering it more ''stiletto friendly'' for female guests -- would break the project's $180,000 budget. No problem: Morton's father had connections, and he garnered cost-effective materials and labor to realize both the walkway and a LOT/EK-designed dining table. Poured and cast resin has also been well utilized by other artists and designers. They include the painters L.C. Armstrong and Fred Tomaselli and the sculptor Rachel Whiteread, whose luminous resin works (a) influenced the English furniture designer Simon Dance to make the table shown here (b). Inquiries can be sent to mail@simondance.com.</p>
        <p>6. The loft's industrial-looking color palette was achieved using baked-on car paint (for the yellow interior tank sections) and poured epoxy (for the blue floor). LOT/EK suggests Benjamin Moore's Industrial Maintenance Coatings, which come in such colors as ''Safety Yellow'' and ''Safety Blue,'' to approximate the look. A gallon costs $35.79 at Janovic/Plaza, 161 Sixth Avenue.</p>
        <p>7. Morton's dog, Ski, may not venture onto the apartment's catwalk, but he is content to lounge downstairs and play with his superswanky toys. He prefers to get his rubber bones from the Blue Ribbon Dog Company, the ultrachic canine outfitter. They cost around $20 at Ad Hoc Softwares, 136 Wooster Street, Paul Smith, 108 Fifth Avenue, and the Terence Conran Shop, 407 East 59th Street.</p>
        <p>8. Dog bones excepted, the loft is fairly devoid of ornamentation. The few artworks Morton does display are three sculptures by his mother, Judith Morton. She works in metal and in stone, and also in marble, as in ''Contentment,'' pictured here. Her most recent show was at the Prudential Center in Boston.</p>
