        <p>No sideshow. No stinging slights from a former coach. No taunts from a scorned teammate. What is this, a Jets football game without an attendant carnival?</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh has griped all season about his desire to shuck all the distractions that fill the days between games and focus only on football. He finally got his wish. The Jets face the Steelers today at Giants Stadium in what may be the quietest game on the season's schedule.</p>
        <p>Sandwiched between a bye week that followed an emotional and hugely hyped game -- a victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Keyshawn Johnson that the Jets are still deriving motivation from -- and a second clash with Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots, the game against the Steelers has provided Groh with one of the toughest tasks of his coaching tenure.</p>
        <p>Forget trying to keep his players' attention during the hullabaloo surrounding other games. Try getting their attention in a week that is ripe for a letdown, when the Jets, after a week without a game, face a 1-3 team that they are expected to beat soundly. And then come three straight division opponents.</p>
        <p>Groh began last week by noting to the Jets that last Sunday, three teams that had not won a game -- including Pittsburgh -- went on the road and won. The Steelers won at Jacksonville, 24-13.</p>
        <p>''There should be a good lesson in there to every team that if you take the slightest bit for granted or don't feel the greatest degree of being threatened, teams are so even, that's enough to make a difference,'' Groh said. ''We're a team that's got some players that have been around a little bit that understand what being in the race is, that it's just week to week and how you have to compete every week.''</p>
        <p>The Jets may be saved from overlooking the Steelers in part because a glance at the Steelers' season should produce a shudder of recognition for the Jets.</p>
        <p>The Steelers use a fearsome defense -- they sacked Jacksonville's quarterback, Mark Brunell, seven times last week and held the Jaguars to 26 yards rushing -- to balance an inconsistent offense. The Steelers have held opponents to 78 yards a game rushing and have nine sacks; the Jets have held opponents to 90.3 yards a game rushing and have 11 sacks.</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh quarterback Kent Graham's rating of 69.5 is only slightly better than Vinny Testaverde's 64.7.</p>
        <p>And while the Jets have won three of their four games with fourth-quarter comebacks, the Steelers lost two games in the closing moments. If parity is a staple of the National Football League, then this game is a prime example of the fine line that separates success and failure.</p>
        <p>The Jets' offense, in particular, is in no position to look haughtily at an opponent. Once Testaverde briefly aired the dirty laundry -- receivers were running wrong patterns, players were not being substituted correctly, he was having trouble reading defenses -- it became clear what the primary concern of the bye week would be: getting the offense on track.</p>
        <p>The Jets have faced some of the toughest defenses in the league already this season, particularly those of the Bucs and the Buffalo Bills. Testaverde declined to offer details of what was done last week, but -- after first taking responsibility for the troubles because he is the leader of the offense -- he said he thought it was a productive week.</p>
        <p>''We know we can play better than what we have,'' Testaverde said. ''I don't feel there will be a letdown because we know we can get better. It doesn't matter what their record says. The offense is going up against a very good defense.</p>
        <p>''If they were an undefeated team, they'd be up there with the Bucs' defense, with the Buffalo defense. But because their record is not as good, they're not getting that kind of recognition.</p>
        <p>''It has to be just another game. We try not to look back at what we've done and try not to let the record let us believe that we've better than we are. If we felt we couldn't improve upon our performance, we'd be walking around with big heads.''</p>
