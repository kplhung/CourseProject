        <p>Robert Egles, the executive director of the New Jersey Parole Board, returned last week to his $87,000-a-year post after a six-week medical leave, but he may not be there for long. Kenneth Connolly, who served as acting executive director in Mr. Egles' absence, said recently that there was no change in Mr. Egles' job status, but, he noted, ''His status is being reviewed and that final review could be complete any day now.'' Mr. Connolly said the review was not related to any investigation. ''He expressed an interest about doing something else on the board,'' said Mr. Connolly. ''It's a situation where there needed to be continued discussions and to figure out a place where to best use his talent.'' If Mr. Egles were to leave, he would be the second high-ranking official in the troubled state agency to vacate his position. In July, the board's chairman, Andrew M. Consovoy, resigned while under investigation by the state attorney general amid allegations he gave favorable treatment to several inmates with links to organized crime.</p>
