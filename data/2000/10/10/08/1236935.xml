        <p>THE tiny 1.8-square-mile borough of Highland Park in Middlesex County, N.J., has been taking on a cosmopolitan flavor in recent years. Eating establishments such as Jerusalem Pizza and Kosher Chinese, which reflect the Jewish character of Raritan Avenue, the main business street, have been joined by Pad Thai, the Seven Hills of Istanbul and a Chinese bakery. Although less than a mile long, Raritan Avenue has about two dozen places to eat.</p>
        <p>Like its diverse restaurant offerings, Highland Park is made up of distinct communities and interest groups. It is about 30 percent Jewish and supports four Orthodox synagogues and the Highland Park Conservative Temple. The borough is surrounded by a symbolic fence, using utility and other wires, that is called an eruv and that permits Orthodox Jews to carry objects or wheel baby carriages within its confines on the Sabbath. There are seven churches representing various Christian denominations.</p>

        <p>THE tiny 1.8-square-mile borough of Highland Park in Middlesex County, N.J., has been taking on a cosmopolitan flavor in recent years. Eating establishments such as Jerusalem Pizza and Kosher Chinese, which reflect the Jewish character of Raritan Avenue, the main business street, have been joined by Pad Thai, the Seven Hills of Istanbul and a Chinese bakery. Although less than a mile long, Raritan Avenue has about two dozen places to eat.</p>
        <p>Like its diverse restaurant offerings, Highland Park is made up of distinct communities and interest groups. It is about 30 percent Jewish and supports four Orthodox synagogues and the Highland Park Conservative Temple. The borough is surrounded by a symbolic fence, using utility and other wires, that is called an eruv and that permits Orthodox Jews to carry objects or wheel baby carriages within its confines on the Sabbath. There are seven churches representing various Christian denominations.</p>
        <p>Forty-nine percent of the borough's adults have at least four years of college, and there is a thriving community of students and lecturers associated with Rutgers University, just across the Raritan River in neighboring New Brunswick. In the early morning and evening they can be seen walking across the Raritan River Bridge, along with many commuters to New York City headed to or from the New Jersey Transit train station in New Brunswick. There are also significant black, Hispanic, Asian-American, artistic, literary and gay communities.</p>
        <p>''Our diversity is ethnic, social, religious and economic,'' said Mayor Meryl Frank, a political scientist and Democrat who last year unseated an entrenched Democratic Party machine by pledging to bring the politics of inclusion to the borough. ''My son has one friend who is a millionaire and another who is homeless and they all sit together at school. Students know that some families can have two same-sex parents and that's O.K. People here are accepting of differences.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Frank said her administration would be judged by the success of her efforts to revitalize downtown, which has a few empty stores and a dowdy appearance because of cracked and yellowed sidewalks and an abundance of aging storefronts. She said she was assembling a team made up primarily of local volunteers to determine how Highland Park can best be promoted.</p>
        <p>''We need more parking, but I'm not sure that our downtown revitalization should include the normal brick pavers and old-style street lamps,'' she said. ''We must capitalize on Highland Park's strengths. For instance, we could have local artists paint murals on large buildings and put sculptures in public places so people driving through will know we are an artsy town.''</p>
        <p>Despite its diminutive size, Highland Park has a large range of housing. The unifying factors are an abundance of maple trees and the age of the houses -- most of them more than a half century old. Last year, 125 single-family houses were sold through real estate agents. Prices ranged from $77,000 for a two-bedroom, one-bath ranch on Raritan Avenue to $1,210,000 for the largest house in the borough, the three-story, six-bedroom Greek Revival Livingston Manor House, on two acres that include a pair of barns and a greenhouse.</p>
        <p>Situated at 81 Harrison Street in the northern section, the house was first built in the early 1800's and has had several additions since. It is named for an early owner, the Rev. John H. Livingston, 1830's head of Queen's College, now Rutgers University.</p>
        <p>The house is the focal point of the proposed 12-block Livingston Manor historic district with its 1920's colonials, many with slate roofs and sweeping verandas, that sell for $250,000 to $500,000. The Highland Park Historical Society is preparing applications to have the district included on both the National and New Jersey Registers of Historic Places.</p>
        <p>THE few newer homes in Highland Park are mainly on the northern side of town. Four-bedroom colonials that are about 10 years old on Parkview Terrace sell for from $400,000 to $450,000, said Pamela Zdanowicz, a sales associate with Century 21 J. J. Laufer Realty. The average Highland Park house is a three-bedroom prewar colonial on a 36-by-100-foot lot selling for from $200,000 to $250,000.</p>
        <p>Some of the most affordable homes are in the Triangle section, named for a fork that splits Raritan Avenue into Woodbridge Avenue and New Jersey Route 27, two busy roads in Middlesex County. Several small homes needing work on Columbia Street, Ninth Avenue and Alcazar Avenue in the Triangle went for under $100,000 last year.</p>
        <p>Among newer residents are Micky and Linda Landis, who bought a 90-year-old five-bedroom center-hall colonial on Harrison Street in the Livingston Manor section for $400,000. Seeking a walking town with a sense of community for their three children, ages 4, 2 and 3 months, they moved from nearby East Brunswick, a sprawling township with no main street.</p>
        <p>''I grew up in Highland Park and loved the diversity of the schools and wanted that for my children,'' said Mr. Landis, who works for a real estate investment trust in Princeton, a 45-minute drive away. ''I like the fact that when I am outside, people stop and say hello. And we walk everywhere in town. We also walk to the theater and the restaurants in New Brunswick.''</p>
        <p>At the end of September, 26 single-family houses were on the market. Prices ranged from $109,000 for a small three-bedroom, one-bath colonial on Parker Road in the Triangle to $495,000 for a larger three-bedroom, two-bath colonial on Lawrence Avenue in Livingston Manor. There were also 11 two- to four-family homes on the market, ranging from $159,000 to $295,000.</p>
        <p>Highland Park has about 200 condominium units, most of which are in two high-rise buildings -- the Highlander and River Ridge Terrace -- on South Adelaide Avenue near the New Brunswick line. Recently, two one-bedroom units in the Highlander sold for $55,000 each. No two-bedroom units -- the largest in the building -- were sold in the last year. However, Ms. Zdanowicz estimates that such units would sell for about $120,000. In River Ridge Terrace, sales over the last year ranged from $143,000 for a one-bedroom to $349,000 for three bedrooms.</p>
        <p>According to Ms. Zdanowicz, last spring Highland Park's real estate market was the hottest it has ever been. ''Homes were selling the day they were listed, many with multiple bids,'' she said. ''Now we get few multiple offers, but houses that are priced right still go in a week or less.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Frank said that renters make up  60 percent of the population. There are approximately 3,000 rental units in a dozen large garden apartment complexes around the perimeter of the borough. Ms. Zdanowicz said that rentals range from $750 to $950 a month for two bedrooms.</p>
        <p>Nowhere is diversity felt more than in the 1,650-student Highland Park Public Schools district. It consists of the K-2 Irving School, the Bartle School, for third through sixth grade (and where prekindergarten classes are also held), and the 650-student Highland Park High School for grades 7-12. Class sizes average 20 students in Irving and the high school and 22 in Bartle; the state average is 21.6. Computers are introduced in prekindergarten with mathematics and science play programs. All district classrooms are wired for the Internet.</p>
        <p>The superintendent of schools, Dr. Marylu Simon, said that 70 languages and dialects are spoken in pupils' homes. Although the town population is more than three-quarters white, the school system is 49 percent minority, in part because 300 Jewish students -- 23 percent of the borough's school-age population -- attend religious schools in  Edison and East Brunswick.</p>
        <p>As part of its diversity education, the district satisfies its state-mandated foreign language requirement by teaching Mandarin Chinese to all students in grades 1 to 4. ''It is the most widely spoken language in the world,'' Dr. Simon said. The program is not offered in the higher grades.</p>
        <p>THE district offers 14 advanced placement courses in English, foreign languages, history, the sciences, music and calculus. It also allows seniors who have completed their course requirements to take classes for college credit at Rutgers University. Last year, the district hired a Rutgers professor to teach 14 students a second-year college course in calculus.</p>
        <p>Of the 75-student graduating class of 1999, the last class for which official state figures are available, 82 percent went to college. On the College Boards, the graduates had a combined verbal and mathematics average of 1,092, 83 points above the state average.</p>
        <p>Besides its many restaurants, Raritan Avenue has three book shops, a dozen beauty salons, three camera stores, a dozen specialty food shops and one supermarket with extensive kosher and other ethnic food departments. On Friday afternoons, an open-air farmers market draws crowds to Raritan Avenue. For major shopping, residents can go to the Brunswick Square Mall in East Brunswick or the Menlo Park Mall in Edison, both less than 10 miles away.</p>
        <p>Raritan Avenue was originally part of the Leni Lenape Indian Assunpink Trail, a path that connected the Hudson and Delaware River Valleys. By 1681, the area was home to a dissident Baptist community led by the Rev. Francis Drake, a descendant of the explorer of the same name.</p>
        <p>During the Revolutionary War, Hessian soldiers stationed on the Highland Park side of the river exchanged fire with Col. Alexander Hamilton's artillery in New Brunswick. The first railroad bridge across the Raritan was built by the Camden and Amboy Railroad in 1838, facilitating travel from New York City to New Brunswick. In 1905, Highland Park split from Raritan Township -- now Edison Township -- in a dispute over schools and taxes.</p>
        <p>Today, much of Highland Park remains county parkland. It is sandwiched between the 90-acre Donaldson Park off South Second Avenue on the borough's southern tip, And the 473-acre Johnson Park, on River Road. Both parks have ball fields, picnic grounds, tennis courts and ponds. Johnson Park also has a petting zoo.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 29, 2000, Sunday  An article on Oct. 8 about living in Highland Park, N.J., misstated the period in which the Rev. John H. Livingston, who once owned a prominent home in the borough, was president of Queens College, which is now Rutgers University. It was 1810 to 1825, not in the 1830's.</p>
