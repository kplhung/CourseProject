      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Richard V. Allen's article (July 30) gives the impression that Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign lacked a ''highly structured search'' for a vice-presidential candidate, that a ''co-presidency'' between Reagan and former President Ford almost became ''a deal'' and that George Bush was picked virtually by accident, at the last moment. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
        <p>Ronald Reagan began the search for a running mate in the spring of 1980, when he asked Richard Wirthlin, his director of planning and strategy, to explore voters' views on potential nominees for vice president. In May and early June an extensive survey was conducted of some 20 possible candidates. Three names emerged on top: Howard Baker, Gerald Ford and George Bush.</p>
        <p>Several weeks before the Republican convention, Reagan commissioned Edward Schmults to review the health, financial records, etc. of people who were under consideration. These preparations were conducted in secrecy.</p>
        <p>At the convention, there developed a groundswell for a so-called Reagan-Ford dream ticket. Discussions were held, but at no time was the concept of a ''co-presidency'' accepted, and we were never close to a ''deal.''</p>
        <p>In a private discussion with Ed Meese on Wednesday afternoon, Reagan said he believed Bush was the best prospect. That night, he went to the convention hall to announce it was Bush and to quell dream-ticket rumors that were building.</p>
