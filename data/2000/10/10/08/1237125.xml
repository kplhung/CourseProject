        <p>IN an example of one of Britain's least likely trends -- an imitation of American-style healthy living -- Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones has opened a different kind of private club. There is no boozing until 4 a.m., as is common at London's other private clubs. Nor is there dancing into the wee hours, as is the fashion at Tramp and Annabel's -- two grand dames of the London nightclub circuit. The Harrington Club closes at midnight. Mick Jagger suggested turning a room into a disco. Mr. Wood vetoed it. ''It's not really a place you can make loud noise,'' he said, a sheepish grin spreading over his face.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Harrington Club, on a residential road for which it is named in Chelsea, is designed to be a respite for the socially weary, a place to get a massage in the on-site spa and to dine on heaping portions of organic vegetables. Mr. Wood, is fresh from a stay at the Priory clinic in Surrey, where models, moguls and the occasional rock star have gone to dry out. He drinks Clausthaler now, a beer with only 0.5 percent alcohol. ''You have to drink about 20 of them to equal a pint,'' he explained.</p>

        <p>IN an example of one of Britain's least likely trends -- an imitation of American-style healthy living -- Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones has opened a different kind of private club. There is no boozing until 4 a.m., as is common at London's other private clubs. Nor is there dancing into the wee hours, as is the fashion at Tramp and Annabel's -- two grand dames of the London nightclub circuit. The Harrington Club closes at midnight. Mick Jagger suggested turning a room into a disco. Mr. Wood vetoed it. ''It's not really a place you can make loud noise,'' he said, a sheepish grin spreading over his face.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Harrington Club, on a residential road for which it is named in Chelsea, is designed to be a respite for the socially weary, a place to get a massage in the on-site spa and to dine on heaping portions of organic vegetables. Mr. Wood, is fresh from a stay at the Priory clinic in Surrey, where models, moguls and the occasional rock star have gone to dry out. He drinks Clausthaler now, a beer with only 0.5 percent alcohol. ''You have to drink about 20 of them to equal a pint,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>He is an organic-food aficionado, a penchant he picked up from his wife, Jo, who sought the help of an herbalist 10 years ago when she was misdiagnosed with Crohn's disease. As it turned out, her lagging energy and ballooning weight were due to a punctured appendix. All the food at the Harrington Club is organic, much of it -- like the pumpkin for the pumpkin ravioli -- grown in the Woods' garden in Richmond, a lush enclave 30 minutes north of London.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Wood, a co-owner of the Harrington Club, which opened three weeks ago, is so serious about using organic ingredients that she fired the first chef for cheating. In his place is Arthur Potts, who made a name for himself at London's River Cafe -- and who is, not so coincidentally, Mr. Jagger's nephew. From his kitchen come plates of tuna sashimi, pink and glistening on a bed of greens. There are also white truffles so precious they are weighed tableside before being shaved onto pasta.</p>
        <p>The Harrington closes early -- last call is 11 p.m. -- because of England's strict liquor licensing laws; if it avoids violations during a one-year probation, it is eligible for a ''supper license'' that would allow it to serve alcohol until 1 a.m.</p>
        <p>But it is not merely the exigencies of the law that have made the club a temple of the anti-rock 'n' roll lifestyle. Mr. Wood, the Stones' rhythm guitarist, is 53, and he craves a mellow spot to hang out with fellow dinosaur rockers like Mr. Jagger and Bob Dylan. ''Someplace nice to have your 80th birthday,'' he noted. That is why he said he has no intention of applying for an ''extended license'' that allows clubs to serve liquor until the early hours of the morning.</p>
        <p>He is not alone in his hankering for a healthier life. National statistics show a decline in smoking and drinking, as well as an increase in the average life span, suggesting that the good-health revolution that rose in the United States years ago has finally reached England.</p>
        <p>And yet, on a daily basis, evidence seems to contradict the trend. Health clubs are eerily empty. People smoke everywhere, in offices, restaurants and even elevators. ''It's so P.C., that junk about my body being my temple,'' said Nicolas Lethbridge, lighting up a cigarette one evening after dinner in the Harrington. ''It's such an American idea. I don't see it happening over here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lethbridge does not seem atypical of the Harrington's members. And in fact, for the club to succeed it will have to transcend organic vegetables as a draw. All the successful establishments on London's private club circuit have personalities that extend beyond their walls. It is as true for the venerable gentlemen's clubs, where old chaps gather after a cricket match to play snooker and drink whiskey, as it is for the members-only nightclubs, where young women in halter tops dance on red velvet couches.</p>
        <p>The Harrington, where annual dues are upward of $1,500, is trying to become a modern version of the 19th-century gentlemen's club, though it is too early to gauge its staying power. ''No club is great three weeks after opening,'' said Mr. Lethbridge, a middle-aged financial executive, who has been a longtime member of Savile, one of London's exclusive all-male clubs. ''It needs time to develop an aura.''</p>
        <p>So why did he forsake the Savile for the Harrington? One word: women. And here, the draw of a Rolling Stone as owner might be just the ticket. There were plenty of comely women the other night when Jamie Oliver, known throughout England as the Naked Chef -- not for any lack of clothing, but for a television program he hosts about cooking with simple ingredients -- swaggered into the Harrington with 16 women in tow, among them his new wife, Jules.</p>
        <p>Kate Moss, an honorary member , arrived at 11 a.m. one Tuesday and didn't leave for 12 hours, spending the afternoon in the spa and then dining and drinking into the evening.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wood has sampled all the treatments in the spa, which is overseen by Susan Ciminelli, best known for cosseting the faces of New York society ladies at Bergdorf Goodman. Mr. Wood's favorite treatment?  ''The two-girl massage,'' he answered without hesitation. ''I had to try that one a few times.''</p>
        <p>The Harrington Club was three years and $11.7 million in the making. The Woods invested $7.3 million, with the rest coming from Mr. Wood's business manager, Nick Cowan. The club is adorned with paintings, sculpture and furniture from the couple's own home.</p>
        <p>The most intriguing painting may be one done by Mr. Wood himself, ''Beggars Banquet,'' which was on the inside cover of the Rolling Stones' 1968 album and shows the band members in various stages of debauchery. In Mr. Wood's case, it's a bit of an anachronism.</p>
        <p>One recent evening, Martin Cohen, the assistant restaurant manager, adjusted a Theo Fennell knife so its engraved ''T'' was perpendicular to the table's edge. He rolled his eyes toward the ceiling, where noise was filtering down from a private party in the clubroom above. ''It's going to be a late night,'' he said, pondering how to convince the partygoers to trade their gin and tonics for a fillet before 10. Mr. Cohen has returned to London after five years working at some of New York's late-night hot spots like Odeon and Balthazar, where dinner can start at 2 a.m.</p>
        <p>The group finally descended to the dining room. Two women eyed each other suspiciously, both in Pucci-inspired dresses covered in colorful elliptical shapes. As the evening neared its premature end, Mr. Lethbridge and his friends bemoaned the drinking laws. ''Getting Tony Blair to change them is like getting Bill Clinton to allow Cuban cigars into the United States,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One of his companions, a brunette in a black cocktail dress, suggested, ''Let's go find that martini bar.'' They scooped up their packets of cigarettes and rushed into the night.</p>
