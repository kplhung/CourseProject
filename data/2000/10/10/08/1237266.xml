        <p>Briskly adapting to the fall of Slobodan Milosevic, who was a close diplomatic ally, President Jiang Zemin today sent ''heartfelt congratulations'' to the newly elected president of Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>In his message to Vojislav Kostunica, whose election was certified this week only after a popular uprising that eventually forced Mr. Milosevic to relinquish power, Mr. Jiang wished the new president ''a smooth job in his new lofty position and remarkable achievements in his endeavors towards the stability and prosperity of Yugoslavia,'' according to a report by the New China News Agency.</p>
        <p>China was one of Mr. Milosevic's staunchest supporters during last year's NATO campaign against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, where Mr. Milosevic's security forces were killing and repressing the majority Albanian population.</p>
        <p>China's vehement opposition to the NATO military action -- portrayed here as an imperialistic expansion of American ''hegemony'' using human rights as a pretext -- arose in part from China's own fear that foreign powers might some day support ethnic insurrections in Tibet or in the Muslim region of Xinjiang.</p>
        <p>Throughout the Kosovo bombing campaign, China's official media virtually ignored reports of ''ethnic cleansing'' and other Serbian atrocities in Kosovo and described Mr. Milosevic and his government as heroic defenders of the sacred principle of national sovereignty.</p>
        <p>The criticism of the NATO bombing campaign grew much more shrill after American planes bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May 1999.</p>
        <p>Washington apologized, saying that the bombing was an error, but the bombing caused a deterioration in Chinese-American relations and prompted massive demonstrations outside the American embassy in Beijing.</p>
        <p>When the International Tribunal in the Hague indicted Mr. Milosevic last year for alleged war crimes in Kosovo connected with ethnic cleansing by his security forces, the Chinese government described the indictment as an American-led ''political scheme.''</p>
        <p>In June of this year, China's parliament leader, Li Peng, visited Belgrade for three days, where Mr. Milosevic presented him with Yugoslavia's highest medal, the Great Star.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic, and particularly his Marxist wife, Mirjana Markovic, have long viewed Beijing and its Communist party as powerful friends and the sort of ideological comrades they lacked in eastern Europe after the Communist regimes of the Soviet bloc fell in quick succession in 1989.</p>
        <p>But in the aftermath of the Kosovo war, Mr. Milosevic's international indictment and the rise of his domestic opponents, Mr. Li and other Chinese officials have gradually shifted the stress of their public pronouncements, stressing the common interests linking China and Yugoslavia rather than singling out Mr. Milosevic for praise.</p>
        <p>Today, a foreign ministry spokesman, Sun Yuxi, said that ''China respects the choice of the Yugoslavian people,'' adding that ''we believe that the change of situation in Yugoslavia will not affect the healthy development of China-Yugoslavia relations.''</p>
        <p>The political turn in Belgrade has caused lively traffic on China's Internet bulletin boards, which last year were filled with anti-American venom.</p>
        <p>This time, many anonymous writers have made pointed comments about the success of democracy in Yugoslavia, with one saying, for example, ''Yugoslavs win democracy, how about us?'' and another saying, ''Milosevic's fall is making some people here nervous.''</p>
