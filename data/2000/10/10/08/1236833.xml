        <p>A WORLD FULL OF GODS</p>
        <p>The Strange Triumph of Christianity.</p>
        <p>By Keith Hopkins.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 402 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>The Free Press. $26.</p>
        <p>WHEN I began teaching ancient Near Eastern religions 25 years ago, a colleague had a large cartoon on his door showing a huge monolith (those were the days of Stanley Kubrick's ''2001'') with ''NOTHING'' engraved on it. Before it a group of people bowed and prayed. The cartoon's caption was the remark of a passing anthropologist: ''Is Nothing sacred?''</p>
        <p>In ''A World Full of Gods,'' by Keith Hopkins, very few conventions of formal history, and especially of traditional religious history, are sacred. A pair of time travelers, commissioned by Hopkins (the volume, filled with fictions bearing paraphernalia of fact, reproduces his employment contract with them, complete with his King's College, Cambridge, address) and supplied with Latin and Greek brain implants, realize the dream of all who study antiquity: if only I could be there. ''There,'' for these time travelers, includes Pompeii in A.D. 77, where the promise of the book's title first is fulfilled: ''My initial impression of Pompeii,'' says one traveler, ''was that there were temples and Gods, and humans praying to them, all over the place.'' The team next travels to the late second century, to Tebtunis in Egypt and to Mabbug/Hierapolis near the Euphrates, and finally, backward in time again, to Ephesus a bit earlier in the same century. For all the fancifulness, humor and good (and bad) sex in these time travels, the portraits we receive are based on careful and wide-ranging research, and they are as helpful an introduction into the eras portrayed as we have. Moreover, we get a defense of the kind of history Hopkins is writing: his time travelers are first irritated by, then converted to, a variety of conflicting accounts and voices. ''Like getting different bus times in modern Egypt,'' one traveler confesses, ''I realized that having a variety of accounts, instead of a single 'true' account, made some sense. . . . Mixing autopsy with narrative is not conventional, but I personally think it's fair.''</p>
        <p>Nor does time travel begin to exhaust what is unconventional in this volume. Thus, about a century after the death of Jesus a bickering television crew films a debate among pagans, a Christian and a Jew : ''The mythical camera (like sources, according to the historians' charter myth) never lies.'' The Christian, Justin, is at once the unctuous chaplain of an Oxbridge college who so often shows up on such productions and yet also Justin Martyr, a second-century Christian worthy. Given the identities (the footnotes help) of those in the televised debate and the dates of their births and deaths, the group cannot possibly have dined and debated together. The scene's creator knows this chronological impossibility, and thus supplies several carping notices from achingly pedantic scholars -- these notices hurt, because in fact we all can, and often do, write just like this.</p>
        <p>However we choose to label its genre -- soft,'' ''novelistic,'' ''atmospheric,'' ''semichaotic'' history are all suggested by Hopkins -- A World Full of Gods'' has yet more imaginative delights for the reader: footnotes congratulate those who persevere to read the things; there are lots of dirty pictures and tales; humor abounds (''it all goes to show, doesn't it, that sexuality, hypocrisy and being a slave don't pay''); and, when Hopkins poses admirably acute questions about ancient religions, admonishing letters from scholarly pals appear. These and other departures from formal history do, indeed, belie ''the fiction that fictional accounts lack historical value.''</p>
        <p>If unconventionally portrayed -- or, perhaps, precisely because so portrayed -- the world of antiquity comes remarkably alive here. We learn a lot, too, about Gnosticism, the Dead Sea Scrolls, early church councils and disputes over creeds, what we can know about the historical Jesus (not much), Syrian pole-sitters, the Septuagint and other Greek translations of the Hebrew Bible, euhemerism, Nag Hammadi, Manichaeism, Docetism and more. If any of those terms initially seems as difficult to grasp as to pronounce, obstacles fade quickly in the author's gripping narrative.</p>
        <p>And yet the book is quite filled with the sacred, as was the Roman Empire of the centuries on either side of the birth of Christianity; it was, as has been said by many scholars, ''the religious marketplace of antiquity.'' If you went to the main square in any good-size town in Egypt, Syria-Palestine, Asia Minor (Turkey) or Greece -- or in Rome itself -- about A.D. 50 you would see on every corner not banks but the hawkers of different religions. ''Worship the Syrian Goddess,'' one would shout, ''she can give sight to the blind.'' Another would respond with a still more demanding miracle: ''Come to Isis, who has granted sight to those born blind.'' ''The Great Mother,'' she of Asia Minor, a missionary proclaims, ''grants immortality to those who believe,'' and this, then, is topped again by the Isis evangelist, who preaches that Isis not only gives the gift of immortality at death but also that of a transformed life, of salvation, in the present. When the armies of Alexander the Great reached Egypt and then further east in the fourth century B.C., the resulting mix of things Greek and Near Eastern was a recipe for spicy new entrees of philosophy and religion -- a religious globalism every bit as revolutionary, and as baffling in its appeals both to yesterday and to tomorrow, as the 20th-century economic globalism of Thomas Friedman's book ''The Lexus and the Olive Tree.''</p>
        <p>So, how, in this religious equivalent of free-market capitalism, did Christianity triumph? How, especially given Christianity's inauspicious start (in Galilee, of all places, which is sort of like Fargo) and the astonishingly few Christians in, say, A.D. 100? The numbers -- and this is an area where Hopkins himself has done some fundamental recent research -- are astonishing: ''Best estimates suggest that there were considerably fewer than 10,000 Christians'' then, he writes, ''and only about 200,000'' a century later, that figure representing ''only 0.3 percent of the total population of the Roman Empire.''</p>
        <p>Hopkins's answers to the question of Christianity's puzzling and unpredictable triumph are surprisingly conventional. Christianity triumphed, in the first place, because of the strength of the three pillars upon which it rested: the church was supported by ''the emerging tradition of apostolic succession legitimating episcopal power, of the rule of faith, and of the canonical scriptures.'' Secondly, this religion flourished while its early competitors died because of the support of the Roman state following the conversion of the emperor Constantine. Surely these are plausible responses; but both the quite brilliant way in which Hopkins poses the question of Christianity's improbable triumph by accenting the many appeals of its competitors, and also the novel genre of history represented in this volume, lead us to expect something different, something more: state support and three powerful pillars; that's it, after Hopkins's promisingly trenchant critical account of Christianity?</p>
        <p>And speaking of something more: it is disturbing that amid all this fetching playfulness, from which we do learn plenty, we learn so little of where Hopkins stands. Even to ask the question, of course, is to fall into a trap that historians like to set. ''Don't confuse facts,'' new historians might argue, ''with the truth, and don't object to a variety of authorial voices: the world is complex, is deceiving, and is opaque to the literal-minded.'' Sorry I asked, we may be tempted to respond, but in fact I'm not sorry, and the question is fairly posed. Both facts and the truth often emerge, I guess, in the footnotes, which are admirable testimony to massive learning and careful research, but a little literal confession and wider use of the insights of those whose expertise is the history of religions might aid more people than simply the feeble-minded.</p>
        <p>But Hopkins's chief purpose here is not that of his subtitle. It is rather to direct a compelling production of religious antiquity, a drama as varied and contradictory and upsetting of conventions as was the world it portrays. In this purpose he succeeds as few others have. Those of us who study antiquity are often asked: What should I read to understand the world in which Christianity was born? I used to answer: Read ''The Golden Ass'' of Apuleius. Now I'll add: And ''A World Full of Gods.'' Still, the wish remains -- to join Hopkins's time travelers and television crew, to live for a moment in the Syrian city of Hierapolis in the first century and to stand before the twin towers on which folks perched precariously and for weeks to witness their piety rather than to stop the chain saws.</p>
