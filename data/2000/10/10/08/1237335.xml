        <p>The New York Times Company Foundation is seeking applications from New York City high school seniors for its college scholarship program, which has helped 43 underprivileged students attend Ivy League and other selective universities since its founding two years ago.</p>
        <p>Reporters and editors of The Times will award five seniors up to $12,000 a year for four years. Additional grants will also be available from a new endowment begun last year with $1 million from the Starr Foundation, which supports education.</p>

        <p>The New York Times Company Foundation is seeking applications from New York City high school seniors for its college scholarship program, which has helped 43 underprivileged students attend Ivy League and other selective universities since its founding two years ago.</p>
        <p>Reporters and editors of The Times will award five seniors up to $12,000 a year for four years. Additional grants will also be available from a new endowment begun last year with $1 million from the Starr Foundation, which supports education.</p>
        <p>Applicants must demonstrate outstanding academic achievement, a commitment to community service and perseverance in the face of significant obstacles, whether financial, physical or family related. Priority is given to students whose parents are not college graduates.</p>
        <p>Among the scholars have been several recent immigrants who struggled to learn English even as they mastered calculus and chemistry; a young woman who had been homeless; the children of drug addicts and AIDS victims; and a survivor of child abuse. Despite their struggles, these students graduated at the top of their classes, and many of them performed volunteer work.</p>
        <p>''These are miracle kids,'' said Arthur Gelb, the director of the college scholarship program. ''They've had so few opportunities, and we are opening doors to them, not only helping them get into colleges by giving them scholarships, but watching over them and helping them in every way possible.''</p>
        <p>In addition to financial support, The Times provides summer jobs for several of the students and takes them to Broadway shows and on other cultural excursions. Reporters and editors also serve as mentors to the winners. Last year's recipients were selected from among nearly 2,000 applicants.</p>
        <p>A complementary program, the Teachers Who Make a Difference Awards, uses a two-year grant of $550,000 from the Charles H. Revson Foundation to honor the teachers who scholarship winners say helped them most during high school. During this school year, The Times plans to sponsor a conference at which the 43 teachers chosen during the past two years will run workshops for their colleagues on teaching and mentoring strategies.</p>
        <p>All seniors in New York high schools, public, private and parochial, are invited to apply by Oct. 28. (Applications were recently sent to principals and guidance counselors.) Winners will be announced in March.</p>
