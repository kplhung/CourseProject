        <p>A glowing review propels you into a wine shop. I'm sorry, the manager says, we are out of the wine and can't get more. Another disappointment.</p>
        <p>Wine journalism's public secret is that, large brands aside, often you can't find the recommendations. And maybe never will, unless you bond with a trusted merchant who will tip you off to arriving beauties.</p>
        <p>Take the lithe, elegant '98 Bourgogne Vezelay, Cuvee Henry de Vezelay, chardonnay, made in Vezelay by Bernard Raveneau of Domaine Raveneau, a Chablis standard-bearer.</p>
        <p>The francophile Kermit Lynch, a merchant's merchant in Berkeley, Calif., imports it. His distributor here, Winebow, carries it. Last year, by the time I discovered the splendid '97 Vezelay, Winebow's small consignment had gone to restaurants. No store had it. I spiked the review.</p>
        <p>At Winebow's recent portfolio tasting for the trade, Albert L. Hotchkin Jr., an owner of the Burgundy Wine Company, 323 West 11th Street (Greenwich Street), sampled the '98 Vezelay. ''I like this stuff,'' he said. ''I'm going to buy it.''</p>
        <p>Winebow said that, in a first-round shipment, it could give New York only 150 cases (a second consignment is due later this month). Mr. Hotchkin ordered 10, and they were to be delivered this week. They won't last.</p>
        <p>For $14, fanciers of white Burgundy can relish the star-bright pale color, fresh-apple aroma, glaze of fruit, appetite-sharpening racy acidity and overall grace of this raw-bar tonic. When it's sipped slightly cool, you'll see why it rates a 92 score.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, cosmopolitan Americans' wine values will be powerfully influenced by terroir, a nearly untranslatable French word that expresses the unique agricultural origins, the authenticity, of a wine.</p>
        <p>A textbook example is the Chablis-like terroir of Mr. Ravenau's Vezelay vineyard -- limestone soil with tiny oyster fossils -- which is translated into his chardonnay's bracing minerality.</p>
