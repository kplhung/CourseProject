        <p>When German officials began their efforts to integrate 17 million former East Germans into the West following four decades of Communism, American diplomats and economists hoped to do likewise with over 140 million Russians, spread over seven time zones, after seven decades of Communism. The Germans will likely succeed, but it has been a much harder task than they originally envisioned. The Americans have failed. Seventy years of history's most comprehensive totalitarianism, following centuries of absolutism, left an institutional and moral void that -- compounded by the suddenness of the Soviet collapse -- has so far proved impossible to overcome. ''So great is Russia's economic and thus social catastrophe that we must now speak of another unprecedented development: the literal demodernization of a 20th-century country,'' writes Stephen F. Cohen, professor of Russian studies at New York University, in ''Failed Crusade.''</p>
        <p>Even before Russia's financial collapse of August-September, 1998, in which Western investors lost tens of billions of dollars, Russia's gross domestic product was half of what it had been in the early 1990's: twice the decline of the United States economy during the Great Depression. Cohen blames bad advice from the United States for the debacle, and his terse, blistering polemic assails the entire community of Russia experts who, he claims, ''committed malpractice throughout the 1990's.''</p>
        <p>Cohen refers to America's Russia hands as ''missionaries'' and ''evangelists.'' Suffused with post-cold-war triumphalism, they regarded Russia as ''a nation ready, willing and able to be transformed into some replica of America.'' There is almost no scholar, investor, economist or journalist associated with Russia who is not castigated (if not in the text, then in the notes) by way of an arrogant or Pollyannaish remark that the author has dug up. Cohen attacks people -- including Richard Pipes and Zbigniew Brzezinski -- who understood in the 1980's, as he did not, that Soviet Communism could not be salvaged. He fails to emphasize that the Russians never implemented much of the advice of the very experts he attacks for losing Russia. And his own advice -- that we should not have bombed Serbia or expanded NATO and that we should adopt instead the ''collective approaches'' of the United Nations, all for the sake of courting Russia -- amounts to capitulation, not engagement.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Cohen writes with bracing clarity on a subject obscured by euphemisms and double talk regarding Russia's so-called democratic renewal. It is precisely Cohen's insight about the Soviet system's deep roots in Russia's past -- an insight that in the 1980's helped blind him to Communism's irredeemable failure -- that has allowed him since the early 1990's to see that capitalist shock therapy would ultimately fail. According to Cohen, a people's historical experience supersedes economic theory. Thus, as he explains, what worked for Poland -- a small, ethnically homogeneous country exposed to the Enlightenment, with a rudimentary market infrastructure even before the collapse of the Berlin Wall -- would not necessarily work for Russia. Cohen provides a stimulating counterchronology to challenge the official Washington view of post-cold-war Russia as a string of qualified successes and disasters avoided, in which good democrats, led by former President Boris Yeltsin, have battled bad neocommunists, particularly Yevgeny Primakov, a former prime minister and foreign minister.</p>
        <p>Cohen writes that in 1991, Yeltsin, without any responsible preparation, abolished the Soviet Union, creating a bureaucratic vacuum. In 1992 and 1993, ''hyperinflation generated by economic shock therapy . . . wiped out the life savings of most Russians.'' Also in 1993, Yeltsin used tanks to overhaul the elected Parliament and the entire constitutional order of post-Soviet Russia. The next year, he launched a war against Chechnya, killing tens of thousands of civilians. In 1998, following a series of financial deals that failed to benefit most Russians, Yeltsin's government -- after promising never to do so -- devalued the ruble and froze bank accounts, economically decimating average citizens once again. And in 1999, after a series of apartment house bomb blasts that Russia's own security services may have set, Vladimir Putin, then prime minister, and a former K.G.B. agent, launched a second war against Chechnya, killing thousands more civilians. The war's popularity helped Putin to succeed Yeltsin as president, in nearly monarchical fashion.</p>
        <p>Cohen's thesis is that Yeltsin, rather than Russia's first democratic leader, was a neoczarist bumbler who destroyed a democratization process that, in fact, should be credited to Mikhail Gorbachev. As for Primakov, rather than the Communist-era ogre so labeled by the American media, he was a ''centrist by nature,'' and the only prime minister to rely on Parliament rather than on the oligarchs. And whereas reformers such as Anatoly Chubais, the darling of America's Russia experts, were despised throughout Russia for colluding with the oligarchs to destroy living standards, Primakov, hated in Washington, was popular at home for steering between radical reform and Communism, in order to alleviate the suffering of ordinary people.</p>
        <p>Cohen is particularly scathing toward American journalists, whom he depicts as overly influenced by the prosperity of a small, rapacious upper class in the major Russian cities, and who seldom ventured into the countryside to see the terrible price of the reformers' handiwork. For example, he derides an editorial in The New York Times for celebrating a new McDonald's in Moscow, frequented by the nouveau riche arriving in Jeep Cherokees and Toyota Land Cruisers, while the average monthly wage ''was about $60, and falling.'' Though, broadly speaking, his criticism of the American press is valid, there are important exceptions, notably the travel writer Jeffrey Tayler, who wrote extensively for The Atlantic Monthly about the most distant parts of rural Russia in the 1990's, substantiating Cohen's own claims about the destruction of living standards.</p>
        <p>Cohen's argument is impressively confirmed in its essentials by Chrystia Freeland's ''Sale of the Century.'' Freeland, a former Moscow bureau chief for The Financial Times, has written one of the finest works of journalism on post-Soviet Russia. In an often witty, savvy style that demonstrates a thorough knowledge of economics and of Russian society, she has reconstructed the inside story of how Russia was undermined by a new establishment composed of oligarchs and reformers, each of whom needed the other. By giving away the major companies to these tycoons, she writes, ''Russia was robbed in broad daylight, by businessmen who broke no laws, assisted by the West's best friends in the Kremlin -- the young reformers.''</p>
        <p>The result was a ''capitalist politburo'' supporting ''a narrow layer of the super-rich,'' while destitute people in the hinterlands, robbed of the value of their life savings by the reformers' price liberalization, froze to death in snowbanks. Freeland reports that it was Primakov who ''was determined to weaken the oligarchs' grip . . . and his campaign against them had more muscle'' than that of the young reformers. She notes, too, that the ''moral sensitivity'' of the Gorbachev era -- in which the public was repelled by the use of force in Lithuania -- gave way to indifference during the Yeltsin years, in which the ''blood bath'' perpetrated by Russian troops in Chechnya offended almost nobody.</p>
        <p>However, while American triumphalism and navete contributed to Russia's economic free fall in the 1990's, it does not follow that American officials and economists are morally culpable. Embattled policy makers like Strobe Talbott, the State Department's Russia czar, had only distasteful options at their disposal. Moreover, if Russia does improve economically and morally in the coming years, the last 10 may not seem in retrospect as awful as Cohen, in particular, depicts them. On the other hand, a decade of chaos has fostered, among average Russians, a longing for order that could legitimize a new and lethal despotism under Putin. The historian Martin Malia has argued that it is the ''heavy Soviet heritage, not the mistakes of the last decade, real though those are, that is the major source of the present impasse.'' It is that burdensome past that has blunted the West's influence. Indeed, Cohen himself sounds somewhat like a missionary by ascribing so much importance to his own society's impact on such a distant, vast and intractable country.</p>
