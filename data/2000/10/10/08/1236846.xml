        <p>CONDITIONS OF FAITH</p>
        <p>By Alex Miller.</p>
        <p>Scribner, $25.</p>
        <p>The Australian novelist Alex Miller's ambitious and convincing fifth novel is about a young woman named Emily Stanton who, while living with her parents in Melbourne in the 1920's, meets and rather hurriedly marries Georges Elder, a French-Scottish engineer who wants to build a bridge over Sydney Harbor. They plan to live in Georges's apartment in Paris, but if his company wins the job, he and Emily will return to Australia. The marriage quickly begins to unravel. Georges's mother and aunt live in Chartres, and when the newlyweds visit them Emily discovers a somewhat morbid intimacy between mother and son, who attend Mass together and make it clear that she is not invited. Left to her own devices, Emily takes a guided tour of the cathedral and somewhat improbably finds herself having sex with a young priest in the building's crypt. (When she becomes pregnant, she fears her husband is not the father.) Emily begins to suffer from fainting spells, and while traveling to Tunisia for a month's rest she meets a young archaeologist named Olive Kallen and catches a glimpse of what her life might have been like had she not married so young. While in college, Emily had studied classical civilizations, and the time she spends with Olive raises a complicated question: should she leave her unhappy marriage to work as Olive's assistant? Miller's prose can at times be cloying (''her full figure sculptural in the soft light'') and his characterizations can be thin, but ''Conditions of Faith'' is highly readable, and it explores the psyche of a woman torn between family and career with subtlety and grace.</p>
