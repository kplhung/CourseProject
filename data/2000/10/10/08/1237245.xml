        <p>Surrounded by pine woods, the 825-foot high granite dome that looms over this suburb east of Atlanta is famous for many things: the Rushmore-esque relief of the Confederate leaders Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis and Stonewall Jackson; the birthplace of the modern-day Ku Klux Klan; and 3,200 acres of forest and lake that make Stone Mountain Park among the state's most popular tourist destinations.</p>
        <p>Now, courtesy of the company that dreamed up Dollywood, the Dolly Parton theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., Stone Mountain is about to have another attraction, a $100 million theme park on Southern history and heritage.</p>
        <p>Over the next 10 years, Silver Dollar City Inc., a family-owned company based in Branson, Mo., that reports $213 million in annual sales and proclaims Christian values, plans to build, among other things, a mammoth children's play area simulating the activities of children in the antebellum South and a theater that promises to deliver a ''multisensorial film adventure'' on Southern life and landscape.</p>
        <p>''When our guests enter Stone Mountain Park, they will cross the threshold into the story of the Southern spirit,'' the company's promotional materials say about the planned attractions, which were approved last month by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, the state agency that controls the park.</p>
        <p>But representations of history are contested here, and the Dollywood makers' ambitions have riled a few people. Stone Mountain Park, they say, is a rare green oasis in this sprawling concrete metropolis. And in their minds, turning it into a theme park -- to modify the refrain of a Dolly Parton hit song -- would just be messing up their mountain and filling up their streets, making Stone Mountain look tackier than anybody has a right to.</p>
        <p>''It's very, very important we keep some natural beauty and not commercialize everything we put our hands on,'' said Bill Chambers, a resident of nearby Snellville who drives through the park daily.</p>
        <p>''Next thing you'll have,'' he said, ''is Stonywood!''</p>
        <p>Silver Dollar officials say that naysayers like Mr. Chambers would be opposed to any development in Stone Mountain. Only 300 of the park's 3,200 acres, they point out, is approved for development. Besides, they say, they will not turn it into an amusement park, exactly, but, as they have elsewhere, use Stone Mountain to tell the story of the South.</p>
        <p>''Creating memories worth repeating'' is the company's mission statement, its chief executive, Mel Bilbo, said. ''We believe we can become America's best storytellers.''</p>
        <p>But those plans compel some to wonder: Whose story?</p>
        <p>''Southern history is a mixed story,'' said Chuck E. Burris, 49, a Louisiana native who in 1997 became Stone Mountain's first black mayor and voted in favor of the development this year. ''It's full of terror, rape, murder, heroism, disregard for the Constitution, triumph of the human heart. If we give a balanced and true history, I won't complain.''</p>
        <p>Stone Mountain's most renowned historical marker is one that many people would rather not remember. The modern Ku Klux Klan was born here, at a rally in 1915, and for the next 50 years, it was the host of an annual Labor Day cross-burning rite at the base of the mountain. James Venable, the Klan's imperial wizard, lived here. The place became so synonymous with the Klan that Martin Luther King Jr. invoked its name in his 1963 ''I have a dream'' speech: ''Let freedom ring, from Stone Mountain of Georgia,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For 40 years, the agency ran the park's profitable hotels and restaurants. But in 1998, when Gov. Zell Miller privatized the park, Silver Dollar took control of its revenue-producing businesses, including parking and hotels, in exchange for roughly $10.6 million in annual rent. The park draws four million visitors a year and generates about $50 million. The new attractions are expected to double that figure, and increase local and state tax revenues.</p>
        <p>Given those financial incentives, Mayor Burris, a member of the association, said he could not turn down the Silver Dollar proposal. He was sold on the concept, he said, after visiting the company's flagship -- the theme park in Branson, where visitors are regaled with displays of traditional Ozark crafts, about 50 G-rated variety shows and all-you-can-eat buffets.</p>
        <p>The company also owns an 800-seat showboat, the Branson Belle, featuring acts like ''Todd Oliver and His Amazing Talking Dog, Irving.'' Its Dixie Stampede dinner theaters entertain diners with trick horses able to leap through rings of fire.</p>
        <p>At Stone Mountain, company officials said, the new developments will be in the already built-up parts of the park. Where an antebellum plantation now stands -- with a plantation house, two slave cabins and tour guides dressed in period finery -- the play area will open next summer. The ''four-dimensional'' theater will open in in 2002 and will show a film about the South, the smell of cornbread filling the arena and mist falling on the audience when it rains on the screen. In 2004, a Reconstruction-era Atlanta main street will be recreated.</p>
        <p>As for the details of historical content, Curtis Branscome, the Memorial Association's chief executive, says he is relieved that he will not be making those decisions. The park, after all, no longer draws exclusively ''plain old white Southerners,'' as he put it, but also tourists of all cultures.</p>
        <p>For their part, company officials say they want to tell what they call the fun side of the Southern story. Slavery will not be part of the attractions, at least not initially, nor the Klan. ''It just isn't a factor here, the Klan and the life of the Klan,'' said a company co-founder, Peter Herschend. ''The important thing to realize is that we are in the entertainment business. We're not in the business of history.''</p>
        <p>The Memorial Association will be discussing historical content soon because, although it has approved the project, it must review each individual development.</p>
        <p>''If they come up with something mealy-mouthed and sugar-coated with respect to African-Americans, Native Americans, immigrants,'' said Mr. Burris, whose town is now predominantly black, ''I'm going to have a problem with that.''</p>
        <p>A balanced, truthful story of the South, he said, can inspire. He pointed to his example. ''As a child,'' he explained, ''I certainly never thought I'd be mayor of Stone Mountain.''</p>
