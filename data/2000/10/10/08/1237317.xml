        <p>Vojislav Kostunica, whose shoe-leather campaign and reputation for honesty made him the choice of a nation fed up with Slobodan Milosevic, was sworn in today as the new president of a deeply divided Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, a 56-year-old constitutional lawyer, won presidential elections on Sept. 24, but he was propelled into office by a popular revolt sparked by Mr. Milosevic's manipulation of the results. Hundreds of thousands of protesters overwhelmed Serbia this week, forcing an end to Mr. Milosevic's 13-year rule, which brought his shrinking country war, isolation and poverty.</p>
        <p>Looking pale and weary, Mr. Kostunica took the oath of office today before the newly elected federal Parliament, swearing to uphold Yugoslavia's ''integrity, sovereignty and independence.''</p>
        <p>In a wandering acceptance speech, Mr. Kostunica praised the workings of Serbia's new democracy, where finally political differences might be worked out peacefully. ''Today political parties are replacing one another in power,'' he said. ''Everything is peaceful, and Yugoslavia and Serbia have joined the community of democratic nations.''</p>
        <p>But he got a swift foretaste today of the difficulties that he confronts. The scene at the 1970's-era conference center -- chosen as an alternative to the federal Parliament, which was burned in the revolt on Thursday -- was chaotic. Legislators, many of them accompanied by burly bodyguards, negotiated furiously about a future federal government, one result of a half-finished revolution that was bogging down in legal wrangling and political bargaining.</p>
        <p>Among Mr. Kostunica's problems will be to guide a loose coalition of 18 disparate opposition parties that have never run anything larger than a city. But he must also work to maintain the very Yugoslav Federation over which he presides.</p>
        <p>He must deal with the problem of restive Montenegro, which has moved a long way toward independence, and of internationally run Kosovo, whose largely Albanian population wants only to be free of any connection with Belgrade, no matter what foreign powers might think.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica's inauguration was delayed when his supporters, citing fraud in the presidential vote, disputed the number of parliamentary seats they were awarded, while members of Mr. Milosevic's coalition members fought to keep their Montenegrin allies on board and thus preserve their majority. The Montenegrins appeared to remain with Mr. Milosevic's coalition for now, but gave hints that they might soon switch to Mr. Kostunica.</p>
        <p>The new president has floated the idea of a unity government of experts on the federal level that could include members of other parties that had backed Mr. Milosevic, like the Socialist People's Party from Montenegro, and even Mr. Milosevic's party itself.</p>
        <p>In trying to gain a majority for his parliamentary allies, Mr. Kostunica has the complex task of trying to court both pro- and anti-Milosevic factions in Montenegro: the Montenegrin Socialists, and the Montenegrin president, whose boycott of the September elections left his party with no seats in the federal Parliament. Mr. Kostunica also knows that the Constitution, altered in a day by Mr. Milosevic in July, must be changed again to keep Montenegro inside Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>There remains great bitterness toward the Milosevic government, with Socialist Party headquarters being trashed in at least 20 cities across Serbia.</p>
        <p>Today, at the Parliament, a student who belonged to the Otpor, or Resistance, movement and served in the army during the Kosovo war confronted two senior Milosevic men, Ljubisa Ristic and Goran Matic, for denouncing the movement as terrorist. ''I'm a member of Otpor,'' said Filip Isajlovic. ''I was in Kosovo last year. And I will never, ever forgive you for the words and names you called us.''</p>
        <p>Working out new relationships with the rest of Europe and the United States, which have welcomed Mr. Milosevic's downfall with full-throated delight, could be comparatively easy, despite questions over the extradition of Mr. Milosevic and other Serbs to The Hague on charges they committed war crimes in Kosovo and Bosnia. The West is eager to help Serbia with financial and other aid and has promised to begin lifting some sanctions against Yugoslavia -- though not the most damaging ones -- as early as Monday.</p>
        <p>As the federal legislators gathered here this morning, there were reports by witnesses that Mr. Milosevic's son, Marko Milosevic, had flown on a Yugoslav Airlines flight to Moscow, YU-132, with his wife, Milica, and his son, Marko. His uncle, Borislav Milosevic, is Yugoslavia's ambassador to Moscow.</p>
        <p>Ida Kovacevic, a stewardness on the plane, said in an interview after the flight returned here: ''Marko came in as an ordinary passenger. He acted normally, and we acted normally. There was no special treatment.'' She confirmed that his wife and son were also aboard.</p>
        <p>Belgraders noted gleefully today that in his resignation speech on Friday night, Mr. Milosevic said he wanted ''to spend more time with my family, especially my grandson, Marko.''</p>
        <p>''He should go join them soon,'' said Vesna Mitic, standing today staring at the burned-out Parliament building where legislators can no longer meet.</p>
        <p>But Meri Locani said: ''I wouldn't even let him go to Russia. Why did he let all this happen? If people have a chance, they would hang him and his wife here in the square.''</p>
        <p>When she heard Mr. Milosevic's resignation speech, Mrs. Locani said, ''I was so happy, as happy as I've ever been.'' She wiped at her eyes. She has a paraplegic daughter, Savina, 27, she said, adding: ''I'd be the happiest person in the world if she could walk. But in the last few days I was so happy. It was almost as if she were walking.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Milosevic remains here, with stated ambitions to continue in politics as the Socialist Party leader, which makes many uneasy. Aleksandar Tijanic, Mr. Milosevic's former spokesman who became a critic of his rule, said today: ''As long as Milosevic remains on the Serbian political scene and shows a desire to be politically active, he represents a threat.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic ''represents the political interests'' of all those not in the democratic opposition, Mr. Tijanic said in an interview. But more important, ''he's also the supreme commander of the net of paramilitaries, para-police and para-financial interests'' that have thrived with and supported him and his wife, Mirjana Markovic.</p>
        <p>''Milosevic can pull some strings,'' Mr. Tijanic said. ''These cannot bring down the new government, but can keep it in constant instability and keep the public of Serbia in a constant state of tension.''</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Kostunica's main challenges, Mr. Tijanic said, is to enforce his authority over the opposition coalition and prevent any revolutionary bypassing of the law. ''He should break down party interests in the coalition, because he won as the candidate of Serbian political opinion, and not as their candidate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The more powerful Serbian Parliament, which has supported Mr. Milosevic and whose members are not scheduled to face election until next year, is to meet on Monday. Maneuvering there with two parties that have been sometime allies of Mr. Milosevic could alter the face of the Serbian government, but exactly who will now control that legislature remains uncertain.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the Serbian Parliament will recognize Mr. Kostunica, and may fire the Serbian Interior Minister, a key Milosevic ally, and abolish a draconian information law.  But Mr. Kostunica and his allies must also begin to control the Serbian ministries that are now beholden to Mr. Milosevic and his coalition. The opposition is moving ''minister by minister, institution by institution,'' trying to establish cooperation, a party leader said.</p>
        <p>Both the Greek and Norwegian foreign ministers flew to Belgrade today for the hastily arranged inauguration ceremony.</p>
        <p>The Greek minister, George Papandreou, and his government have tried to be intermediaries between Serbia and the rest of Europe, and between Mr. Kostunica and the Milosevic government. Mr. Papandreou said the end of Mr. Milosevic's rule ushers in ''a new era in relations between Yugoslavia and Europe.''</p>
