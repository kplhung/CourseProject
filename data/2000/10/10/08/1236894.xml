        <p>Because George W. Bush was frequently answering questions on a variety of subjects from reporters on his campaign plane, his aides noticed that their chosen message of the day at major events was not getting through. ''Because Gore wasn't doing avails like that,'' said Karen P. Hughes, ''the networks were using shots from his events.''</p>
        <p>Peter Marks, a New York Times reporter, noted, ''Unlike the campaign of Vice President Al Gore, which has strictly limited the candidate's access, Mr. Bush</p>
        <p>and his advisers have provided a steady diet of the kind of 'availabilities' that reporters crave.''</p>
        <p>When were press availabilities born? How do these differ from news conferences? When did they get clipped to avails?</p>
        <p>In June 1980, Representative John B. Anderson was running for president as an independent. ''The congressman continues to receive substantial local attention,'' wrote Warren Weaver in The New York Times, ''from the daily sessions at each campaign stop that his staff labels as 'press availabilities.''' Three months later, as Ronald Reagan's lead over Jimmy Carter narrowed in polls, easy access to the G.O.P. candidate was curtailed; The Toronto Globe and Mail noted that ''all 'press availability' sessions with the former California governor have been dropped.''</p>
        <p>Reagan understood the shade of difference in the lexicon of access. ''I have had now over 120 interviews since I've been in office,'' he said in 1983, ''and numerous press availabilities.'' An interview is a talk with one reporter or a small group. A news conference (changed from press conference by President Richard Nixon, who believed the event should not belong to the press but to the newsmaker) is usually called to make an announcement and to take questions on that and other subjects. A press availability is actively passive; that is, political figures open themselves to general questioning, putting the burden of creating news on the press. It is less focused on the candidate's preferred message and is therefore, from a campaign's point of view, riskier.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Mary Schmich of The Chicago Tribune noted that Senator Bob Kerrey ''faced the media in a routine campaign free-for-all known as a 'press avail.''' Two years later, Howard Wilkinson of The Cincinnati Enquirer wrote: ''The flacks who surround political candidates like to call it a 'press avail.' . . . No one in the glamorous and fast-paced world of high-power politics has time to say six syllables when one or two will do.''</p>
        <p>Without the word press, the word availability has a different meaning in today's politics: ''commercial time available for purchase by advertisers.'' But in American political history, that word has profound resonance as a derogation of opportunism. In 1840, Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri said scornfully of the Whig candidates William Henry Harrison and John Tyler, ''Availability is the only ability sought by the Whigs.'' And lexicographic objectivity forces me to report that Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote in an essay the next year, ''Conservatism . . . goes for availableness in its candidate, not for worth. . . .''</p>
        <p>Nudge That Noodge</p>
        <p>A political divide has opened into a cultural chasm between two old friends.</p>
        <p>''Al [Gore] and I have tremendous regard for this industry,'' Senator Joseph Lieberman told a star-studded event raising funds from entertainment moguls. ''It's true from time to time we will have been, will be, critics or noodges.'' Having used the Yiddishism noodge, a noun meaning ''pest, annoying nag, persistent complainer,'' Lieberman went on to confuse the assembled glitterati by using the English verb nudge as if it were interchangeable with the Yiddish noun: ''We will nudge you, but we will never become censors.''</p>
        <p>To nudge is ''to push mildly or poke gently in the ribs, especially with the elbow.'' One who nudges in that manner -- to alert, remind, or mildly warn another'' -- is a far geshrei from a noodge with his incessant, bothersome whining.</p>
        <p>Lieberman's use of both the Yiddish noun and the English verb in the same paragraph, suggesting wrongly that they meant the same, resulted in the compounding of the error in a statement by his longtime across-the-lines soulmate, William J. Bennett.</p>
        <p>''I did not realize that when Joe Lieberman and I,'' stormed the author of ''A Book of Virtues'' and other best sellers, ''were denouncing the filth, sewage and mindless bloodletting of the popular entertainment industry, calling it what it is -- degrading and dehumanizing -- we were just being 'nudges.' I am a virtual absolutist on the First Amendment, but Senator Lieberman and I were doing more than 'nudging' the entertainment industry; we were trying to shame them.''</p>
        <p>Set aside the rights and wrongs, the hypocrisy or hyperbole, in this lusty exchange during the heat of a campaign. Consider only its demeaning of meaning.</p>
        <p>From here in Semantic Damage Control Headquarters, cool heads are obliged to issue this advisory: Noodge is primarily a Yiddish dialect noun that risks confusion with the English nudge when used as a verb. The meaning of noodge is not merely ''a critic'' but ''a habitual, pesky critic.'' The Yiddish noun noodge signifies a person, one who can sometimes prove useful but who is also not the sort you want around all the time. The English noun nudge is not a person but an action, often of the elbow to another's ribs and frequently accompanied by a wink or a leer.</p>
        <p>The Yiddish noun is only a noun; when the action of a verb is wanted, the phrase is to give a noodge. The English nudge is both a noun and a verb, first used in verb form by Thomas Hobbes in 1675 in his translation of the ''Odyssey'': ''I nudg'd Ulysses, who did next me lie.''</p>
        <p>The pronunciation is different. Though some noodges will dispute this, in the Yiddishism the oo is pronounced as in look rather than the oo in stooge. Not in dispute is the English pronunciation of nudge, rhyming with judge and never even close to the Dickensian Scrooge.</p>
        <p>You got that, Bennett? Du herst, Lieberman? Now shake hands and come out fighting.</p>
