        <p>The first omen of the game was positive, so positive many of the Shea Stadium fans stood, cheered and waved their arms, one to a person. They were doing a bad imitation of the tomahawk chop, as practiced by fans of the Braves, but the imitation-without-tomahawk was the Mets fans' way of derisively and delightedly waving goodbye to the Braves.</p>
        <p>Marvin Benard, the San Francisco Giants' leadoff hitter, had been in the batter's box for only moments, as long as it took Rick Reed to throw the first two pitches of the game, when the fans erupted. Were they already cheering 0-2 pitches, hoping for strike three? No, they were reacting to the result posted on the scoreboard, the only score, the one with the ''F'' in front of it: STL 7 ATL 1.</p>

        <p>The first omen of the game was positive, so positive many of the Shea Stadium fans stood, cheered and waved their arms, one to a person. They were doing a bad imitation of the tomahawk chop, as practiced by fans of the Braves, but the imitation-without-tomahawk was the Mets fans' way of derisively and delightedly waving goodbye to the Braves.</p>
        <p>Marvin Benard, the San Francisco Giants' leadoff hitter, had been in the batter's box for only moments, as long as it took Rick Reed to throw the first two pitches of the game, when the fans erupted. Were they already cheering 0-2 pitches, hoping for strike three? No, they were reacting to the result posted on the scoreboard, the only score, the one with the ''F'' in front of it: STL 7 ATL 1.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals had just swept the Braves out of the playoffs. Stunningly, the Braves would not be playing in their ninth consecutive National League Championship Series. The Mets would not have to face their nemesis, their tormentor, their executioner.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was pretty funny when they started doing the chop,'' Todd Pratt said. ''I'm sure people watching from Atlanta didn't feel good about that. But that's great for the fans. New York fans are the greatest.''</p>
        <p>Great fans and funny scenes aside, the Mets would have to get to the league series to savor the Braves' absence, and at the time the fans reacted, the Mets needed to beat the Giants two more times to get there. Make that one time now.</p>
        <p>It took 5 hours 22 minutes, not to mention 13 innings, but when the marathon ended last night, the Mets had snatched a 3-2 decision on Benny Agbayani's dramatic home run against Aaron Fultz.</p>
        <p>Another victory today, and the Mets duplicate their 1999 first-round advance. Playing the Arizona Diamondbacks a year ago, the Mets returned from Phoenix with a 1-1 split, then won Games 3 and 4 at Shea. The winning blow in the 10th inning of the final game was a home run by Pratt. The players' reaction to Agbayani's home run last night was only slightly less hysterical. ''It's not as good as mine; mine was a walk-off division clincher,'' Pratt said, his broad smile quickly turning into hearty laughter. ''That was huge, but he has to climb a few steps on the ladder before he reaches mine.''</p>
        <p>Pratt likes Agbayani too much to have been serious. ''When he was running around the bases and I was waiting for him at home plate, I was thinking about my trip around the bases. I just felt real good for Benny. He's been through so much.''</p>
        <p>Agbayani was in position to win the game because the Mets' relief corps had pitched effectively, especially when the Giants had runners on base, which was often. The same could not be said for the Giants' relievers. Robb Nen, their best, gave up the tying run in the eighth on a two-out double by Edgardo Alfonzo. All that proved was that Dusty Baker, the Giants' manager, was damned if he didn't and damned if he did.</p>
        <p>Baker was criticized after Game 2 for not having brought in Nen to pitch to Jay Payton following Darryl Hamilton's two-out double in the 10th. Baker left Felix Rodriguez in the game, and Payton singled home what would be the winning run. After Nen pitched last night, Rodriguez pitched two scoreless innings.</p>
        <p>Bobby Valentine, meanwhile, pulled the right reliever strings in the late innings. With the game tied, 2-2, he had John Franco pitch the ninth inning and Armando Benitez the 10th and 11th innings. They kept the tie intact.</p>
        <p>Then Rick White pitched the 12th and 13th, leaving two Giants runners on base in each inning and giving the Mets time to win the game. ''I didn't know if I was going to get a chance to get in because I had been up four times,'' said White, whom the Mets acquired from Tampa Bay. ''The bullpen had been doing such a good job up until the point I got into the game, all I wanted to do was throw strikes and get out of the inning as quick as possible without getting hurt as far as giving up runs.''</p>
        <p>The most critical out White secured was the pop-up Barry Bonds lofted to Alfonzo with runners at first and second and two out in the 13th.</p>
        <p>''I walked him the first time,'' White said. ''I got a little too picky with him. The second time I said I'm going to throw him a fastball away. That way if he tries to pull it, maybe he'll pull off it enough to hit a pop-up or a weak grounder to second base. He hit the pop-up to second. It was a hit or miss thing. If he had dove into it and hit it the other way, it might have gone out of the park.''</p>
        <p>But minutes later it was Agbayani's homer that soared out of the park, the ball departing 1 hour 47 minutes after the city's No. 1 Yankees fan, Rudy Giuliani, did.</p>
        <p>In a show of support he has seldom displayed for the Mets, the mayor stayed at Shea until the teams went to the 10th inning tied, 2-2, missing the early pitches at Yankee Stadium. He left at 7:55 p.m., 3 hours 35 minutes after the game began, and arrived at his seat at Yankee Stadium 24 minutes later.</p>
        <p>After the mayor left his front-row seat next to the Giants' dugout, Peter Magowan, the Giants' managing partner, moved up a row. That location might have made for an unobstructed view, but it only gave Magowan a better view of his team's excruciatingly painful loss.</p>
