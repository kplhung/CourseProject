        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Professionals Play the Stock Manipulation Game, Too,'' (Market Watch, Sept. 24), which discussed how regulators settled with a 15-year-old boy whom they said had run a pump-and-dump scheme.</p>
        <p>The column said ''the teenage trader was not yet born when accounting standards were dutifully followed, not flouted, by corporations.''</p>
        <p>That comment was unfair to the thousands of quality corporate leaders and implied that the current state of financial reporting was in shambles. That is certainly not the case with today's United States equity markets. America has the most advanced accounting standards in the world, and they are aggressively enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission and by class action lawyers waiting for an opportunity.</p>
        <p>Actions by the S.E.C. to ferret out manipulation of the market are to be applauded.</p>
