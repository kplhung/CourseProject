        <p>Let's look at the bigger picture. America stands alone among industrial nations in its irresponsible energy policy. Our low taxes on energy lead to dramatic overconsumption of nonrenewable resources, resulting in a staggering environmental toll on the world's ecosystem. Moreover, the overdependence on imported energy makes the United States more vulnerable to price spikes in the volatile oil market. (Oil price surges have caused three recessions in the last 30 years.)</p>

        <p>Re ''Energy Jolt: Who Wins, Loses or Shrugs'' (Sept. 24), which looked at the varying effects of higher oil prices on American companies and consumers:</p>
        <p>Let's look at the bigger picture. America stands alone among industrial nations in its irresponsible energy policy. Our low taxes on energy lead to dramatic overconsumption of nonrenewable resources, resulting in a staggering environmental toll on the world's ecosystem. Moreover, the overdependence on imported energy makes the United States more vulnerable to price spikes in the volatile oil market. (Oil price surges have caused three recessions in the last 30 years.)</p>
        <p>Our country uses far more energy per dollar of economic output than any industrial competitor. Overconsumption is also a major contributor to our country's huge and worrisome trade deficit.</p>
        <p>Yes, truckers do not like higher gasoline prices, but those prices will stimulate shipping by rail, which is far more environmentally benign and safer. Higher prices will encourage trucks to slow down, saving lives and fuel.</p>
        <p>Higher taxes on oil would reduce our vulnerability to such price jolts and allow dollar-for-dollar reductions in other burdensome taxes. Indeed, designating part of the oil-tax revenue to reduce taxes on people of modest incomes would ensure that the net effect would be progressive.</p>
