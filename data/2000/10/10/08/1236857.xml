        <p>MIST rose from the deep gorge that separates Turkey from Armenia on the day I toured the ruins of an ancient city that has nearly slipped from historical memory. Once this was the capital of a great empire and home to kings, bishops and 100,000 prosperous citizens. Today it is eerie and abandoned, the shells of its great churches and palaces conveying a deep sense of the impermanence of grandeur.</p>
        <p>This city was Ani, which 10 centuries ago was the seat of Armenian royalty. For years it has been off limits to visitors because it was close to regions that were caught in the war between the Turkish army and Kurdish rebels.</p>
        <p>Now, however, the war is all but over, and Ani is once again accessible. Last spring I  made it the centerpiece of a thrilling trip through eastern Turkey.</p>
        <p>Ani had been long forgotten when French and British explorers rediscovered it in the 1830's. One of them wrote that he found ''something impressive and almost awful in the sight of a Christian town, built in a style so peculiar to itself, and unknown to modern Europe, now nearly in the same state in which its destroyers had left it eight centuries ago.'' Another was even more poetic, declaring that ''the deserted yet still standing city resembles the corpse whose breath had fled, but which still retains the semblance of life.''</p>
        <p>No houses remain in Ani, though with a bit of imagination one can pick out foundations or patterns of stones that suggest where neighborhoods might have stood. A single paved avenue, undulating through what was once the center of town, hints at the original street pattern.</p>
        <p>Rising proudly from this desolation are the regal remains of a dozen great buildings that testify to Ani's former glory. They are as breathtaking today as they were when European outsiders first reached the site a century and a half ago. Stone churches are covered with inscriptions that are still  clearly legible to anyone who can read Armenian. In some of them, frescoes depicting biblical scenes are still vivid. Windows are surrounded by intricate geometric patterns chiseled into white stone. Fallen columns that litter the landscape are decorated with  star and spiral designs.</p>
        <p>The remains of massive walls, stately arches and carved domes testify to the audacity of the people who built this place.</p>
        <p>Ani's golden age began in the 10th century, when Armenian kings of the Bagratid line, who claimed descent from Kings Solomon and David, made it their capital. Invasions and family feuds weakened their kingdom, but it was later revived under Georgian protection. In 1319 Ani was struck by an earthquake, and the last inscriptions date back to 1348. A few stubborn survivors remained, but soon the place was abandoned.</p>
        <p>Today visitors to the site, which covers several wind-swept square miles, are assigned young Turkish soldiers as guides.  Each speaks a foreign language and carries a few sheets describing the site, but they are more friendly than informative. Their main job is not to guide visitors but to make sure they don't rummage for souvenirs.</p>
        <p>After passing through the main gate, I walked to the ruin of one of three churches  dedicated to St. Gregory the Illuminator, a fourth-century missionary who is one of the most revered saints in the Armenian pantheon. It was once a 36-sided edifice centered around a statue of Gagik, one of the great Armenian kings. Today it is open to the sky, but parts of its thick walls still stand. Huge chunks of the columns that once supported the dome litter the bare ruined choirs inside.</p>
        <p>King Gagik's wife, Katramide, was the patroness of a nearby church built in 1001. It is perhaps the most impressive of all the structures at Ani, and looks as if it could have inspired Gothic architects in Europe. Four thick columns support the roof, much of which is intact. Rectangular windows look out over the gorge below.</p>
        <p>As I walked through the ruins of Ani's  churches I could almost hear Gregorian chants and smell incense from perfumed censers. In some ways I found it more affecting than famous, often crowded ruins like those at Ephesus, a thousand miles away near Turkey's Aegean coast. At Ani, my three companions and I were just about the only visitors. Our solitude, combined with the extraordinary Armenian and Georgian-style architecture that soars so gracefully above the treeless plateau, gave this place a deeply moving, otherworldly aura.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, there is much more to discover nearby. Poring over guidebooks old and new and consulting with friends who live in the area, I plotted a course that took me and my companions to several other wonderfully impressive sites. None can really qualify as unknown, but all have fallen from the tourist itinerary over the last couple of decades.</p>
        <p>The logical base for a trip through this region is Van, a richly historic city on the shore of Lake Van, the largest lake in Turkey. Since I had already seen Van, I chose a different route. Our flight from Istanbul landed in Mus, and from there, traveling in a borrowed van, we made our way along the less-known north shore of the lake. Our first stop was Ahlat, a modest town that has fallen far from the days when it was a center of Urartian, Azerbaijani and Armenian kingdoms. Its main attraction is a huge Ottoman cemetery, opened in the 15th century, that is full of tall headstones carved with intricate Arabic inscriptions.</p>
        <p>The commanding stones reminded me of the great statues on Easter Island. Like the statues, they are mute messengers from a distant era, and at the same time powerful objects of beauty. Two tall and magnificently domed turbes, mausoleums built for Ottoman nobles, stand near the cemetery. They add to the air of history that hangs over this place, as do the seemingly ageless land turtles that crawl among the stones.</p>
        <p>From Ahlat we drove a few hours along the lake shore, which is dotted by neat villages and hillsides where peasants herd sheep and goats. After a while we turned  toward our next destination, the 18th-century Ishak Pasha palace, about 50 miles to the north.</p>
        <p>Other buildings in Turkey are as fascinating as this one, but probably none is so dramatically situated. It sits on a rocky crag near the Iranian border and commands a view for miles around, which explains why it was chosen as a Silk Road observation post as early as the 12th century.</p>
        <p>The present palace, which is quite well preserved and decorated with magnificent stone carvings, was built in the late 1700's  by a feudal clan called the Cildiroglu. According to various accounts they were Georgians, Turks, Armenians, Kurds or some mixture thereof. The palace's architectural style is equally confused, once described by Turkey's pre-eminent modern chronicler, John Freely, as ''an eclectic anachronism'' that combines ''elements of imitation Seljuk, mock-Georgian, neo-Armenian and rococo Ottoman.''</p>
        <p>The palace served as both fortress and pleasure dome, with a harem and a dining room that was equipped with tilted mirrors so servants could see what dishes needed replenishing without bothering the revelers.  I walked down a narrow staircase to the dungeon, which includes a ''death room,'' an eerie dark chamber into which prisoners were thrown from a hole above.</p>
        <p>For us the way out was down a winding road that was a bit unnerving but certainly less frightening than the death room. Soon after we emerged onto the main road we caught sight of the majestic Mount Ararat, where, according to the Bible, Noah's ark came to rest after the great flood. At 16,945 feet high, Ararat is Turkey's highest mountain, shrouded in myth and capped with snow all year. It remained in sight for nearly an hour as we made our way toward Ani.</p>
        <p>Ideally one should take at least a full day  to absorb Ani's spiritual power, but we had one more spot to visit. From Ani we drove west for several hours to the town of Yusufeli, which is likely to disappear under water in a few years if plans to build a new dam nearby come to fruition. The town's main attraction is a roaring tributary of the wild Coruh River, a dream destination for white-water rafters. I cursed the circumstances that made it impossible for me to take a few days to ride the churning rapids, but was soon compensated for that disappointment by the glories that lie hidden in the surrounding mountains.</p>
        <p>Ten centuries ago, the region around Yusufeli was part of a Georgian kingdom, and it is dotted with churches that testify to the heights that this civilization once reached.  Far apart and off main roads, the churches take time to find. We chose three. One, known as Osvank or Oski, is adjacent to a village. It was part of a monastery dedicated to St. John the Baptist, and carvings of angels dominate the main entrance.</p>
        <p>We also visited Ishan, which was a religious center as early as the seventh century.  According to an account by Georgian monks, the present church, which is constructed of great stone blocks and decorated with ornate carvings, was built by two holy men in the ninth century after ''God revealed to them the original greatness of this site.''</p>
        <p>A schoolhouse now stands next to it, and we were approached by a teacher who, with a couple of friends, has formed a civic group dedicated to protecting the splendid church.  I happily gave him 5 million lira (about $8).  ''We're angry at the teachers who were here before us,'' he said as he wrote out a receipt, ''because they didn't do anything to preserve this wonderful monument.''</p>
        <p>Both churches were memorable, but neither compared to the awe-inspiring monastery called Dortkilise. Far up on a remote mountainside, the stately church commands a spectacular view over a deep forested gorge that bears only one sign of human habitation: a tiny stone hut once used by ascetic monks. The surrounding countryside has barely changed since the church was built more than 1,000 years ago. On the walls inside, faded paintings depict the prophets, the Virgin Mary and the enthroned Christ.</p>
        <p>As I stepped outside, I tried to recall where in the dozens of countries I have visited I have seen a place that was at once  so physically grand and so spiritual, so remote and so welcoming. I could think of none.</p>
        <p>On the road to an abandoned city</p>
        <p>The best time to visit the region is between June and October. Only those trained for arctic survival should venture there between November and February.</p>
        <p>Turkish Airlines flies daily between Istanbul and Kars, the former Czarist garrison town that is the closest city to Ani. The flight  stops in Ankara, and the round-trip fare is $169, at 667,000 lira to $1.</p>
        <p>The best hotel in Kars is the Karabag, 84 Faik Bey Caddesi, telephone (90-474) 212-3480, fax (90-474) 223-3089. Doubles are $60  with breakfast. The staff can help arrange permits to visit Ani, which are free and easily available at the local government tourism office.</p>
        <p>There are no buses from Kars to Ani. Taxi drivers will make the 40-minute trip for about $10.50 each way.</p>
        <p>Travelers who want to begin their trip in Van can fly there from Istanbul on a daily Turkish Airlines flight, which like the one to Kars costs $169. There is an Avis car rental office at 1 Hastane Sokak in Van, telephone and fax (90-432) 214-6375. One-day car rentals begin at $68, with discounts for longer rentals. Roads in the region are quite good.  There are still occasional army checkpoints, a reminder of the now-ended guerrilla war, but tourists are usually waved through without question.</p>
        <p>The Avis office is near the Buyuk Urartu Hotel, where a double costs $100 with breakfast; telephone (90-432) 212-0660, fax (90-432) 212-1610.</p>
        <p>Artvin is the best base from which to explore Georgian churches. The Karahan Hotel, 16 Inonu Caddesi in Artvin, charges $27 for a double room, telephone (90-466) 212-1800, fax (90-466) 212-2420. A reliable English-speaking guide is Fatih Sahin, who can also arrange white-water rafting trips. His cell phone number is (90-532) 622-9489.</p>
