        <p>ON WRITING</p>
        <p>A Memoir of the Craft.</p>
        <p>By Stephen King.</p>
        <p>288 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Scribner. $25.</p>
        <p>LIKE Charles Dickens, Stephen King endured hard times in childhood that he evokes in his fiction; like Dickens, he can write as he wishes and reach his loyal readers no matter how reviewers respond to his books -- On Writing,'' I'm sure, included. The book affects a tough, down-to-earth manner: the blue-collar guide to hammering stories together. It seems that King doesn't want to address the need to work with more delicacy, and perhaps he doesn't see one. Clearly, he wishes to make some statements about how he writes and how you can, if you want to, imitate his ways. He knows a lot about writing for magazines and about reaching vast audiences, and many of his anecdotes are interesting.</p>
        <p>The first section, ''C.V.,'' is about King's ''odd, herky-jerky childhood,'' and how he was raised by a single parent. His mother, widowed young, always poor, is portrayed as charming and dedicated, sacrificing herself for him and his older brother. King remembers a baby sitter, Eula-Beulah, in terms of cruelty, torture and the abundant generation of body gas. He remembers throwing up on his mother's shoes when Eula-Beulah locked him in a closet. He remembers the pain of having his eardrums punctured by a doctor, and adults who lied when they said that the puncturing wouldn't hurt. Movies, comic books and stories took the imaginative boy away from his difficult world, and the writing of stories -- his first customer was his mother -- gave the young boy ''an immense feeling of possibility . . . as if I had been ushered into a vast building filled with closed doors and had been given leave to open any I liked.''</p>
        <p>So King started, though in trying circumstances, as most writers start: seeking to woo the adults, needing to make a world that he might order and control. King evokes a frightening ''tangled wilderness area'' in Connecticut, where his mother moved her family for a while, bordered by a junkyard and a train track -- This is one of the places I keep returning to in my imagination,'' he writes -- and in it he sets a recollection of a childhood lower-intestinal emergency and his cleanup with leaves that turn out to be poison ivy. The marriage here of that biological problem and the nightmare area to which King returns suggests a certain infantilism in the person, I suppose, but also a key element in the novels. Though not as poetically, King captures, as Dickens did, the frights of childhood: the rebellion of the body; the transformation of nature -- those leaves -- into affliction; the metamorphosis not only of people -- a baby sitter becomes a gaseous monster -- but of machines (typewriters, cars, motors in factories), all of which were elements of his childhood and of his young adulthood as a worker at low-paying, exhausting jobs in rural Maine.</p>
        <p>King's wife, the novelist Tabitha King, is celebrated throughout the book, and in a famous anecdote she rescues from the garbage pail three single-spaced pages that, with her encouragement, King turned into ''Carrie'' (1974). These pages -- written when King was paid $6,400 a year as a high school English teacher -- became his first published novel, for which Doubleday paid $2,500 for hardcover rights and Signet paid $400,000 for paperback rights.</p>
        <p>After the autobiographical section of about 100 pages, we have roughly 150 pages of advice on writing, some of which is, well, singular. ''Remember,'' the tyro is enjoined, ''that the basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful. If you hesitate and cogitate, you will come up with another word . . . but it probably won't be as good as your first one, or as close to what you really mean.'' This rule will come as a relief to writers for whom thought is painful.</p>
        <p>About meeting an editor who years before turned down a fledgling effort by King, but who now stands in line for his autograph, King has this to say: ''Talk about your ghosts. Man oh man.'' Apparently, while hesitation and cogitation might have brought other words to bear, King could not have bettered the original inspiration. The novice writer is told that ''writers have different skill levels when it comes to dialogue,'' that ''thin description leaves the reader feeling bewildered and nearsighted. Overdescription buries him or her in details and images. The trick is to find a happy medium.'' Over all, this injunction seems to be the most encompassing: ''Write what you like, then imbue it with life and make it unique by blending in your own personal knowledge of life, friendship, relationships, sex and work. Especially work. People love to read about work. God knows why, but they do.''</p>
        <p>A postscript titled ''On Living'' consists of 18 moving pages about King's being run over and nearly killed, his struggle to live, and his and Tabitha's collaboration on his survival through writing. Their courage is exemplary.</p>
        <p>King says, ''I'm convinced that fear is at the root of most bad writing.'' He later writes, ''Grab that book you were looking at off the shelf again, would you?'' A reader might be forgiven for wondering if the root of much bad writing could also be fearlessness.</p>
