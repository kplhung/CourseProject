        <p>New Yugoslav Leader Inaugurates A New Era  Vojislav Kostunica, whose shoeleather campaign and reputation for honesty made him the beneficiary of a nation fed up with Slobodan Milosevic, stood before Yugoslavs as their new leader.

        <p>President Clinton and European leaders seem likely to remove most sanctions on trade and investment with Yugoslavia in coming days.</p>
        <p>17</p>
        <p>Washington is celebrating the downfall of Slobodan Milosevic, a man who for years delighted in defying, befuddling and belittling his far more powerful foes.</p>
        <p>17</p>
        <p>President Jiang Zemin of China, one of Mr. Milosevic's staunchest supporters during last year's NATO campaign against Yugoslavia, sent ''heartfelt congratulations'' to the newly elected president.</p>

        <p>Barak's Issues an Ultimatum  As the violence spread into Lebanon, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel gave Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, 48 hours to restrain protests before Israeli troops would be authorized to use ''all available means'' to quell the riots.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Hundreds of Palestinians overran, ransacked and burned Joseph's Tomb, a site considered sacred to some Jews, hours after it was vacated by Israeli troops.</p>
        <p>10</p>
        <p>The United Nations Security Council approved a resolution condemning ''excessive use of force'' against the Palestinians. The United States, which could have vetoed the measure, abstained.</p>

        <p>Candidates Are Working To Close the Gender Gap  Vice President Al Gore is safely ahead among women, who since at least 1980 have tended to vote liberal and Democratic, but over all, men prefer Gov. George W. Bush -- in one poll likening him to a Maserati and Mr. Gore to a Volvo. Each candidate is trying to bridge the gender gap by tinkering with his image.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore denied the Republicans' contention that he often embellishes his record.</p>
        <p>26</p>
        <p>The candidates are presenting voters with an unusually stark choice over the kind of people they would select as federal judges.</p>

        <p>Battle Over Wildlife Refuge  A wildlife refuge in Alaska is at the center of political battle. It is remote and pristine, but it also rests atop a vast, untapped oil reserve.</p>

        <p>New Jersey Senate Candidate Struggling for Campaign Funds  The race to succeed United States Senator Frank R. Lautenberg is coming down to a stark question -- will the Republican candidate, Bob Franks, have enough money to run a credible race against his Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine?</p>
        <p>37</p>
        <p>Lazio Defends Ads  Representative Rick A. Lazio declared that he had a ''complete commitment to campaign finance reform'' and had not breached the deal with Hillary Rodham Clinton to restrict campaign spending by accepting $1.8 million from Washington Republicans for television advertisements.</p>
