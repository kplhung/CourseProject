        <p>1. Berthold Lubetkin has more listings to his credit with the preservation body English Heritage than any other architect of the last century. (A listing means that the building can't be torn down or restructured.) His Modernist legacy was forged mostly in London and its outskirts in the 1930's. Lubetkin retreated to Gloucestershire in 1939 to become a pig farmer and dropped from view, although he never stopped designing buildings. There was a resurgence of interest in his work in the early 80's after he received England's highest architectural accolade -- the Queen's Royal Gold Medal. Since then, his fellow architect John Allan has further consolidated Lubetkin's reputation with a monograph published by RIBA Publications in 1992.</p>
        <p>2. Not many people, let alone birds, get to live in seminal examples of prewar Modern architecture, but penguins at the London Zoo strut around one of Lubetkin's best-known projects of the 1930's. He designed the Penguin Pool to show off the behaviors of the birds: walkways for waddling, a long pool for speedy swimming and a deep tank for diving. The Penguin Pool cemented the reputation of Lubetkin and his company, Tecton, and garnered international attention for England's Modernist movement. The pool would get a nod of approval from even the most militant PETA adherent, especially since its restoration in the mid-80's by Allan and his colleagues at London's Avanti Architects.</p>

        <p>2. Not many people, let alone birds, get to live in seminal examples of prewar Modern architecture, but penguins at the London Zoo strut around one of Lubetkin's best-known projects of the 1930's. He designed the Penguin Pool to show off the behaviors of the birds: walkways for waddling, a long pool for speedy swimming and a deep tank for diving.

The pool would get a nod of approval from even the most militant PETA adherent, especially since its restoration in the mid-80's by Allan and his colleagues at London's Avanti Architects.</p>
        <p>3. Avanti also restored the Erno Goldfinger house (a) in Hampstead, London, which was acquired by Britain's National Trust in 1995. The Hungarian-born Goldfinger designed the house in the late 30's, and he and his wife, Ursula, filled it with Surrealist works and other modern art, including pieces by Henry Moore and Max Ernst. In an interesting bit of synchronicity, the Goldfingers lived in Highpoint One while their new place was under construction. For tour information, call 011 44 1494 755570. One of Avanti's current restoration projects is the Homewood (b), in Esher, Surrey. Patrick Gwynne, who designed the Modern masterpiece as his own home in 1938, still lives there and has been instrumental in its refurbishment.</p>
        <p>4. Visitors who want to see all the Modernism that London has to offer should consult the newly updated ''Guide to London Architecture,'' by Edward Jones and Christopher Woodward, available this month for $22. On the must-see list: the new Waterstone's (Britain's answer to Barnes &amp; Noble) flagship store in Piccadilly, which occupies the Bauhaus shell of the old 1936 Simpson Piccadilly department store, and the Royal Festival Hall, which opened in 1951 on the south bank of the River Thames.</p>
        <p>5. Although their philosophies often differed, Lubetkin was influenced in his early years by the French architect Le Corbusier. The penthouse at Highpoint Two shared many characteristics with Corbu's own penthouse at Porte Molitor in Paris -- vaulted ceilings, rough walls, cowhides and works by Leger. They even had a similar color scheme -- sky-blue ceilings floating over chocolate-brown floor tiles. If you want to paint yourself into a cool, Corbusian corner at home, consult the Birkh</p>
        <p>6. True to the spirit of the Modernist architects, who incorporated furniture and objects of their own design into their dwellings, Ou Baholyodhin and Erez Yardeni included their own creations in the decoration of their penthouse. Baholyodhin has produced more than one design-world icon since graduating from Kingston University in 1996. His stainless-steel ''HK 97'' chair, which he designed to commemorate the transfer of Hong Kong to China, was used by Tony Blair in his ''Cool Britannia'' promotion of Great Britain. Baholyodhin's work -- a set of nesting tables is shown here (a) -- is admired by some picky people, including Madonna, the Corrs and Karl Lagerfeld. For his part, Yardeni makes Zen-inspired paintings (b) that he characterizes as a ''graphic form of martial art.'' They range in price from $10,000 to $20,000 and are available at Function, a gallery-showroom in London (011 44 207 426 0666). Yardeni is an artist who collects; he spent part of his 20's in Africa, amassing a number of impressive pieces of African art. He also has a cache of old swords, which festoons a wall in the guest room, and a collection of Constance Spry pottery found in English stores and flea markets.</p>
        <p>7. Spry was England's premier society florist, party planner and caterer in the 40's and 50's. The Martha Stewart of her time, she turned the art of flower arrangement on its ear by introducing elements like vegetables, fruit and foliage into her designs. (Reddish-purple kale and lichen branches spice up the arrangement shown here.) She worked with the now-defunct Fulham Pottery to create some 15 decorative vessels in which to properly show off her unorthodox concoctions. Budding florists can take classes at the Constance Spry School in Farnham, Surrey. The school's Web-site address is www.constancespry.com.</p>
