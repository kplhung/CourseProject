        <p>Patrick J. Buchanan has a new plan.</p>
        <p>Still mired around 1 percent in the polls with Election Day only a month away, he now concedes what just about everybody else has always assumed -- that though he was successful in snatching control of the Reform Party from the reformers and turning it into a conservative party, he has no chance of making it to the White House, certainly not this year. But he's not quitting, no way.</p>

        <p>Patrick J. Buchanan has a new plan.</p>
        <p>Still mired around 1 percent in the polls with Election Day only a month away, he now concedes what just about everybody else has always assumed -- that though he was successful in snatching control of the Reform Party from the reformers and turning it into a conservative party, he has no chance of making it to the White House, certainly not this year. But he's not quitting, no way.</p>
        <p>So what's he got in mind?</p>
        <p>The future.</p>
        <p>He is concentrating on finding a way to capture at least 5 percent of the vote on Nov. 7. If he can cross that threshold, he says, the party's future will be bright, long term, because its nominee in 2004 will be eligible for federal campaign funding.</p>
        <p>How does he get to the 5 percent threshold?</p>
        <p>As he sees it, he can do it by very selectively spending the $12 million in federal campaign funds that he got this year because Ross Perot exceeded the 5 percent threshold in 1996.</p>
        <p>He intends to concentrate on states that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas seems to have written off or might write off, such as Massachusetts, which is strongly Democratic and Mr. Bush has no chance of capturing. Other states he is looking at include Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, New York, Minnesota, Maryland, California and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''We plan to go into these states with radio ads,'' Mr. Buchanan said last week, ''and say in effect, 'The race in your state is over. Bush has written it off. Therefore the election is over here. Therefore a vote for Bush is a wasted vote. So take this opportunity in this one-party state to help create a new fighting conservative party.' ''</p>
        <p>Will it work?</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign's answer: ''Nothing's been written off.''</p>
