        <p>Sister-to-Sister Chorus Meeting</p>
        <p>Concert tours of Europe or Asia are common for avocational American choruses these days, but the Choral Arts Society, based in Briarcliff Manor, has gone one better. The society has a sister chorus in Berlin, thanks to a friendship between Timothy Vernon, the society's conductor, and his German counterpart, Peter Schwarz. When the German group, Berliner Cappella, visits the United States, it performs at Ossining High School, and its members stay in the homes of the Westchester singers. The two groups sang Bach's B minor Mass together in Latin here in 1998.</p>

        <p>Sister-to-Sister Chorus Meeting</p>
        <p>Concert tours of Europe or Asia are common for avocational American choruses these days, but the Choral Arts Society, based in Briarcliff Manor, has gone one better. The society has a sister chorus in Berlin, thanks to a friendship between Timothy Vernon, the society's conductor, and his German counterpart, Peter Schwarz. When the German group, Berliner Cappella, visits the United States, it performs at Ossining High School, and its members stay in the homes of the Westchester singers. The two groups sang Bach's B minor Mass together in Latin here in 1998.</p>
        <p>The Choral Arts Society plans its first trip abroad next summer for four concerts in Berlin. Linda Spessotti, a singer with the society, said most of the 70 singers would stay with members of the Berlin chorus. The two groups will also sing together.</p>
        <p>To help finance the trip, the Choral Arts Society is holding an auction from 7 to 10 p.m. next Friday at Scarborough Presbyterian Church. The admission fee of $15 a person or $25 for two includes refreshments. Information: (914) 428-4183.</p>
        <p>Gone, but the Music Lingers</p>
        <p>Thom Wolke has run Twin Cloud Concerts in Garrison for 14 years, doing everything from booking performers to taking ticket orders. His roster has included jazz, contemporary singer-songwriters, blues and classic rock -- ''music that I like,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Wolke is closing up shop to become executive director of the Claremont Opera House in Claremont, N.H.  He officially left Westchester last Sunday, but his presence will be felt in two final concerts.</p>
        <p>Next Friday, Twin Cloud will present ''An Evening of American Acoustic Music'' at 8 p.m. at the Tarrytown Music Hall (tickets, $35), featuring David Bromberg, a Tarrytown native with a national following, the fiddlers and folk musicians Jay Ungar and Molly Mason (at left), the singer-songwriter Danny O'Keefe and a longtime member of the David Bromberg Band, the cornetist Peter Ecklund. On Dec. 17 at the Music Hall, Martin Sexton, a singer-songwriter, will lower the curtain on Twin Cloud's last event. (Ticket number: (914) 424-8361.)</p>
        <p>The Music Hall has given Mr. Wolke both pleasure and frustration. ''I moved to Tarrytown in hopes of seeing the Music Hall run as a performing arts center, but it's not structured that way,'' he said. ''It's essentially just a big rental hall.'' All the same, he said, going to the historic theater is ''like wearing your favorite denim jacket instead of a tux or even a suit.''</p>
        <p>Dining With the Performing Arts</p>
        <p>Some Chicken Valencia with your Ballet Folklorico de Mexico? Balsamic Penne with your Joan Baez?</p>
        <p>Now theatergoers planning an evening out at the Performing Arts Center of Purchase College can mix and match their dinners with the artistry to follow. The center, in its continuing face-lifting effort, has added a restaurant, Overture, to its upper lobby. The space was previously used for receptions, conventions and intermission milling.</p>
        <p>The restaurant will offer a three-course dinner at a fixed price of $36, including coffee, tea and soft drinks. Beer, wine and bottled water will be available at an extra charge. Desserts can be chosen from a Viennese table, offered by the operators, the Cornerstone Caterers of Rye. ''From the very beginning, I've wanted to do this because it makes the event more special,'' said Christopher Beach, director of the Performing Arts Center. ''We didn't have the wherewithal to do it before, but the season has grown a lot more so now it's possible.''</p>
        <p>It is wise to call for reservations (914-251-6200) since the restaurant is not open every night. Some events that are available are the Joan Baez concert next Friday, the Ballet Folklorico on Oct. 20, the Tokyo String Quartet on Oct. 21 and the Capitol Steps on Oct. 22.</p>
        <p>Where Pros and Amateurs Mingle</p>
        <p>If you're not strictly professional but more than avocational, then what kind of group are you in? ''We find ourselves difficult to define,'' said Sue Ellen Silber, a volunteer with the 42-year-old Chappaqua Chamber Orchestra. Members range from professional musicians paid at union scale to talented amateurs, with the occasional college student joining in. Most of the musicians live in the Chappaqua area, but soloists like Igor Begelman, who will play Mozart's Clarinet Concerto with the group next Saturday at 8 p.m. at Horace Greeley High School, lend panache. For information about the group's subscription series, the number is (914) 921-4642.</p>
