        <p>Evan Cornog and Richard Whalen's HATS IN THE RING: An Illustrated History of American Presidential Campaigns (Random House, $39.95) fills in the gaps of dimly remembered high school history classes. If you cannot recall what the Federalists stood for, or who Tippecanoe was, or when Wendell Willkie ran for president, then it will serve as an entertaining primer. Short chapters on each election convey basic historical information: who ran, who won, what issues mattered and how the campaigns were conducted. The text is illustrated by numerous prints, political cartoons and photographs, and peppered with primary sources and anecdotes. We learn, for example, that ''Franklin Pierce commissioned Nathaniel Hawthorne, his former classmate at Bowdoin College, to write a campaign biography. When Horace Mann heard about the project, he quipped that if Hawthorne succeeded in writing an inspiring biography of the undistinguished Pierce, it would be 'the greatest work of fiction he ever wrote.' ''Cornog, the author of ''The Birth of Empire: DeWitt Clinton and the American Experience, 1769-1828'' and an associate dean at Columbia University's School of Journalism, and Whalen, the author of biographies of Robert Capa and Alfred Stieglitz, discuss the enormous influence of the founding fathers; not only did they create a constitutional system, but they also established such a moral standard that for close to a century, politicians refused to campaign extensively, lest they appear more power-hungry than Washington or Jefferson. Even in 1900, observers considered William Jennings Bryan's whistle-stop tour of the country ''begging for the presidency as a tramp might beg for a pie.'' The authors even celebrate the gradual acceptance of campaigning and the decline of the stigma of self-interest, arguing that it creates at least the possibility of open contests and informed electorates.</p>
