        <p>VICENTE WOLF, below. This is a den, and it was done close to 20 years ago for a couple in New Jersey, a doctor and his wife, with seven children, and the wife's parents lived there, too. This room became their ''live-all,'' the space where the whole family could gather. It functioned very well because it provided so much seating. It was leather, the kids could jump on it, but it didn't travel well with time. I've learned since then that the idea of having everything monochromatically ''designed'' makes a strong statement but forgets the humanity of the space. And yet, even then, when environments were hard-edged and modularly oriented, there was the commencement of an understanding of bringing in different periods. The crudeness of that wood table next to the smoothness of the leather yields a yin-yang quality. With today's perspective, I look at the coffee table and I see a very Zen type of surface. That table, which had looked so 80's, becomes contemporary: an Oriental pond of black in the middle of the space.</p>
        <p>MARIO BUATTA, above. Growing up, I spent most of my time at my aunt's. She had winter chintzes and summer chintzes, and everything was very traditional. Her house was my great inspiration. Later, I realized that what I loved more than anything was Nancy Lancaster's butter-yellow room in her London house. I first saw it in the early 60's, in British House &amp; Garden magazine, and I just went crazy. I said, ''This is really me; this is what I love.'' Then, in 1964, I saw the real thing. I was actually in the yellow room, filled with the things she'd collected -- things American, things English, things Oriental -- all put together in a way that looked so relaxed and easy. I waited years to be able to do a room like that. Then, finally, in 1968 I found this apartment on East 62nd Street, and it was the first time I was able to put everything I loved together in a way that was reminiscent of Mrs. Lancaster's home. Only I'd call mine Dole-pineapple yellow!</p>

        <p>THOMAS BRITT, right. I take one element and keep repeating it. Black lacquer furniture with gold chinoiserie decoration was the main theme in this living room, which I designed in the 60's -- that's what set the whole mood. I saw an apartment once that Billy Baldwin did for the Watson Blairs, the parents of Mary McFadden. Their living room was in black, white and brown, and I thought it was just absolutely stunning. Obviously, when you're 23, you remember something like that very vividly, so that's where I'd say the inspiration for this room came from. My clients were a very chic couple, a psychiatrist and his wife, on the Upper East Side. Black lacquer with gold chinoiserie is a classic. It'll be a classic forever, as long as the planet's here. We're still doing it: one of the projects I'm working on now involves many of the same elements, except today we'd have the rug woven rather than using real zebra skins. I would copy the rug in wool; it'd be even chicer done in cotton.</p>
        <p>WILLIAM DIAMOND and ANTHONY BARATTA, above. This is the living room of a model apartment we were asked to do 16 years ago. We were very out of sync with the rest of the world: every time we went modern, everyone else busied things up; every time we busied, everyone else cleaned. In the 80's, everybody was doing traditional. We loved Sister Parish -- but we also loved Joe D'Urso. He was our god and hero. So the idea here was to bring Sister Parish color and happiness to modernism: Joe D'Urso with an Ellsworth Kelly palette. Instead of steel and glass, we used blond-wood chairs by Alvar Aalto. When we finished, we were so proud that we took all the magazine editors over to see it. But they all said they couldn't publish it because it wasn't traditional. We were way too early. That project would have been so influential had we done it 6 years ago instead of 16!</p>
        <p>MICA ERTEGN, below. This was my living room in the late 60's, when everything was white and sparse. The sculpted plaster around the banister was part of the look of the time: big and abstract, like the artworks on the walls (an Ellsworth Kelly over the sofa and a Jack Youngerman on the wall opposite), which were from the Betty Parsons Gallery. That staircase was inspired by the modern feeling in the 60's, because everything had to be minimal and no-frills -- just big white walls and shapes that went into the space. But times change, and your eye changes. The room was very chic, but it didn't have a very livable look. Later, I warmed it up with a simple wood railing, painted white, with cork steps banded in brass, and collected many marvelous pieces of furniture that have age and style. Today, the same space still reads like a white room, but it's much softer and not so stiff.</p>
        <p>SALLY SIRKIN LEWIS, above. This was my house when I first moved to California in 1972. The house had nothing going for it, so I created a fantasy pied--terre, with larger-than-life-size cranes sweeping around the room. The cranes were hand-painted to imitate a beautiful antique Japanese screen I'd bought. This was a very famous room: after it appeared in Architectural Digest, everybody came out with crane fabrics, crane china. It became such a trend. You'd go to Bullock's, and when you went up the escalators, there'd be whole walls of cranes. Given a similar set of circumstances, I'd use natural linen on the walls and hang a suite of artwork all the way around, like the series of 24 Brice Marden prints I just bought for a client. I'd hang them in one line, with steel bars going up to the ceiling to create a vertical line.</p>
