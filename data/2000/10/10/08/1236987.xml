        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his article on Metropolitan Opera recordings [''From the Metropolitan, Truly Rare Recordings: Historic, Live and Legal,'' Sept. 24], Anthony Tommasini overlooks one important fact: copyrights have expirations. After that, they are public domain. Pure and simple. It is just as pure and simple that many Met broadcasts have passed any expiration dates and are public domain.</p>
        <p>Until GATT, Nafta and other treaties of the last decade, Italian law recognized a 24-year copyright. Therefore, any Met broadcasts past that age were fair game (as they should be) and legal. Now the limit is 50 years.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the Met uses strong-arm tactics when importers (such as Qualiton) legally and rightly dare to market broadcasts that are in public domain, knowing these small firms lack the legal deep pockets for what would be a protracted battle. I, for one, wholeheartedly support foreign labels such as Arkadia, Naxos, Myto, Melodram and Gebhardt that make these treasures available to a wider audience. If the Met really had an interest in these recordings, it would work with the unions to make more of them available at decent prices. The day will come when the Met's tactics will no longer intimidate, and these gems (even the least of which is far superior to what is now found on even the increasingly rare ''good'' night at the Met) will be found in local stores.</p>
