        <p>Eddie Layton likes playthings -- the organ at Yankee Stadium, the toy trains in his Queens apartment, the tugboat he sails on the Hudson.</p>
        <p>Yes, that strange-looking, odd-sized maroon-and-green tug that elicits a hearty honk from passing tugboat captains belongs to Layton. And why not? ''When you walk into a marina, all the boats look alike,'' he said. ''They're all white.''</p>
        <p>And, he might have added, none are tugboats. In fact, Layton contends, no one else anywhere has a private tugboat.</p>
        <p>But Layton wanted one. He got this cockeyed idea almost 30 years ago that he would like to be a sailor, and the type of boat that caught his fancy was a tug. He also had plenty of free time during the day.</p>
        <p>Since 1967, when Mike Burke, then the Yankees' president, discovered him playing the organ on three television soap operas -- ''The Secret Storm,'' ''Love of Life'' and ''Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing'' -- Layton has pounded the keys at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>He knows nothing about sports.</p>
        <p>''I thought a sacrifice fly had something to do with killing an insect,'' Layton admitted.</p>
        <p>He also knew little about boats. But he learned by reading yachting magazines.</p>
        <p>He saw a 26-foot hull of a work boat in Maine and somehow imagined another use for it.</p>
        <p>A year and a half later, in 1974, it was launched in Mystic, Conn., to his design. He liked the colors of the classic Moran tugs that ply the New York waterways: maroon cabin, green hull. He put on a just-for-show black smokestack with a big E, for Eddie, on it. He added a mophead-like ''cat's whiskers'' over the bow, which real tugs have. He called the boat Impulse.</p>
        <p>It is only 26 feet long, about a quarter the length of most tugs. Pleasure boats as long as his usually weigh about 5,000 pounds, but his comes in at 15,000. The tug also has a diesel engine, just like real tugs. His is only 80 horsepower, though. The big tugs can go up to 3,000 horsepower.</p>
        <p>His top speed is eight and a half knots, but it does not cost much to go places. He uses about a gallon of fuel an hour. And because it is so heavy, passengers feel as if they are riding in a big limousine on a smooth highway.</p>
        <p>Layton estimates that it costs $5,000 a year to maintain his tug; if it were built today, it would set the buyer back about $100,000.</p>
        <p>He keeps the tug about a mile north of the Tappan Zee Bridge -- a 20-minute car ride from Yankee Stadium -- at the Tarrytown Boat Club. He often spends the nights on the boat when the Yankees are away. The mostly fiberglass boat sleeps four -- two in the front, two in the back. It has a comfortable teak-trimmed day area with room for a couch and four chairs, a sink and a stove. The head is discreetly hidden by a curtain. The rear deck can hold four people sunning themselves. His captain's seat is a narrow bench built for two.</p>
        <p>His guests have included Thurman Munson; Bill White, the former Yankee broadcaster and former National League president; and Bob Sheppard, the silken-voiced public-address announcer.</p>
        <p>A boat is the only thing that Layton drives. He never learned to operate a car. In fact, when Burke asked him to become the Yankees' organist, Layton demurred because he did not drive.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to take the subways home at night,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''We'll send a limo for you,'' Burke told him. The Yankees have done so for 33 years.</p>
        <p>These days, though, Layton gets a ride home at night from Sheppard. As soon as the last out is made, Layton meets Sheppard at the elevator. They are gone before the Yankees file into the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>The same hands that curl the tugboat wheel have been playing the organ for . . . well, Layton does not disclose his age. But the Philadelphia-born Layton -- he majored in meteorology and minored in music at West Chester State Teachers College -- has a distinguished background.</p>
        <p>For many years he worked for the Hammond Organ Company, giving concerts in Asia and Europe to acquaint the public with the instrument. He has issued recordings (his latest CD is called ''Ya Gotta Have Heart''), and he has recorded baseball ''charges'' and other organ music for many films, including Kevin Costner's ''For Love of the Game.''</p>
        <p>Layton is still the answer to the Trivial Pursuit question: ''Who was the only person to play for the Yankees, Rangers and Knicks in the same year?'' He was a longtime organist at Madison Square Garden, too.</p>
        <p>And how does he know that his is the only private-use tugboat in the world? ''Because if I knew where there was another one,'' he said, ''I'd sink it.''</p>
