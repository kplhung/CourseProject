        <p>JUST as there are Chinese-American and authentic Chinese restaurants, there are Indian-American and genuine Indian spots. The new India House in Hicksville's growing Indian enclave is the latter, the real thing. There's a fierce-looking turbaned, bearded chef in the kitchen turning out exotically spiced northern Indian dishes. Tiny framed silver figurines, musical instruments and pottery from the subcontinent are on the walls, the buffet luncheon is served from ornate Asian chafing dishes and there is a tray of licorice-tasting fennel seeds near the door for departing diners. Beveled rimmed silver charger plates, fresh flowers and the plaintive strains of minor key Indian music also set the mood at the spare, serene storefront at 19 Broadway (516-933-6501).</p>
        <p>The service at this clean, light venue is as understated and deferential as the decor. One of the Island's better buys, at $7.95, is that luncheon buffet, with five or six entrees; a continuous supply of warm nann, or white flour flat bread; impeccably cooked rice; starters like deep-fried noodles, chickpeas and potatoes with plain or vegetable-studded yogurt; and rice pudding for dessert</p>

        <p>JUST as there are Chinese-American and authentic Chinese restaurants, there are Indian-American and genuine Indian spots. The new India House in Hicksville's growing Indian enclave is the latter, the real thing. There's a fierce-looking turbaned, bearded chef in the kitchen turning out exotically spiced northern Indian dishes. Tiny framed silver figurines, musical instruments and pottery from the subcontinent are on the walls, the buffet luncheon is served from ornate Asian chafing dishes and there is a tray of licorice-tasting fennel seeds near the door for departing diners. Beveled rimmed silver charger plates, fresh flowers and the plaintive strains of minor key Indian music also set the mood at the spare, serene storefront at 19 Broadway (516-933-6501).</p>
        <p>The service at this clean, light venue is as understated and deferential as the decor. One of the Island's better buys, at $7.95, is that luncheon buffet, with five or six entrees; a continuous supply of warm nann, or white flour flat bread; impeccably cooked rice; starters like deep-fried noodles, chickpeas and potatoes with plain or vegetable-studded yogurt; and rice pudding for dessert</p>
        <p>Among the entree choices are a soothing pea and potato curry amalgam; creamy-rich spinach; fresh okra and potato strips with onions and tomatoes; and at least two types of chicken -- the best of which is the skinless tandoori. It's warm, red-gold in color, marinated in yogurt, spices and herbs, tender, slightly smoky and exudes a mellow fragrance from the tandoor, or clay oven, that permeates the morsels of meat. It's available at dinner in two different $6.95 appetizers.</p>
        <p>The evening meal is a much longer affair than lunch. This is not the place to go for a fast dinner before a movie. The kitchen often moves slowly, with the kind of spacing between courses that sometimes results in India House being the evening's only activity. Fortunately, most of the food is worth the wait (and the prices are right).</p>
        <p>Starters to try in addition to the chicken tikke and chicken tandoori are vegetable samosas ($2.50), or deep-fried turnovers stuffed with a mild meld of potatoes and peas; and simla-mirch-nishat ($4.95), two baked green bell peppers topped with plum tomatoes and filled with a spicy (but not overpowering) minced mixture of vegetables, cashews and raisins. Pakora ($2.50), or deep-fried vegetables, were bogged down by their greasy, soggy batter.</p>
        <p>Although some sauces here are spicy, most of the masalas, or ground spices, herbs and seasonings that flavor the dishes, are not fiery. In fact, many preparations are familiar to Western palates. Lamb chops (not incorrectly listed as lamb champs) are exhibit A. The five soft, succulent herb-seasoned chops arrived at the table still sizzling on a skillet. Eat them with their bed of browned onions for a flavor treat not confined to any nation's boundaries. A way-out sounding dish called murg shashi korma ($6.95) is in fact a mild Indian version of chicken a la king: boneless poultry in a velvety cream sauce.</p>
        <p>Jhinga masala, or tasty sauteed shrimp in a red masala-based sauce, has some kick, but isn't incendiary.  Lamb shahi korma ($7.95) ups the heat quotient a notch or two, but the meat is high quality and the creamy sauce is not just spicy but flavorful.</p>
        <p>Finally, don't dismiss the goat dishes. They are popular all over the world and with good reason. Order the goat-masala, a bony but hearty, rich, pot-roast taste-alike.</p>
        <p>Bread is a must at an Indian restaurant, and at India House it's excellent. The leaf-shaped naan ($1.50) cooked on the inner wall of a tandoor is recommended by itself or to sop up sauces. Roti ki tokri ($4.95), or a sampler basket of naan, paratha (stuffed with ground lamb), roti (puffed bread) and onion kulcha (unleavened bread), is the way to go for a table of four.</p>
        <p>Complementary crisp sheets of peppery pappadam bread made with lentil flour and three dipping sauces -- sweet tamarind, a milder than it sounds red chili, onion and a scorching coriander -- precede the meal.  Generous portions of very good basmati rice accompany it and unusual desserts end it. Delicious, refreshing mango ice cream ($2) was the top sweet with gulab jamun ($2.50), or warm fried milk balls in a sweet cardamon syrup, a No. 2 pick. Less memorable is the soupy, milky cardamon-touched rice pudding and an off the menu offering of pistachio ice cream crowned with crisp, thin white noodles that yielded scant taste.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>Potato Republic, a Dutch family-owned franchise specializing in Belgian-style French fries, is opening its second American outlet, at 339 New York Avenue in Huntington (631-692-9330), next week. The small storefront spot serves soups, salads, sandwiches, wraps and pastas in addition to French fries with various accompaniments.</p>
        <p>Hampton Chutney is moving from its Bayberry Nursery location at 74 Montauk Highway in Amagansett to Amagansett Square where diners will be able to sit at picnic tables and Adirondack chairs on the Village Green. The kitchen, which also turns out chutneys for nationwide distribution, will be housed in a high-roofed barn-like building.</p>
        <p>Marc Weiss, a chef, and Brian Fishman have opened Silhouette Cafe at 274 Merrick Road in Rockville Centre (516-255-9022) at a site that was Scotty Dee's Cafe. The 35-seat Silhouette Cafe will be open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with takeout and prepared foods as well. Foods prepared with health factors in mind will be featured.</p>
        <p>La Cubanita II has replaced the South Miami Cuban restaurant at 183 Bay Shore Road in Deer Park (631-667-8533). Most entrees at the strip-mall storefront cost $5.50 and are ordered at the counter. They include oxtail, barbecued ribs, shredded beef, pigs feet and pigs ears. The price includes a choice from four types of rice and two varieties of beans.</p>
        <p>What was the Emperor's Wok at 4 Main Street in King's Park is now the Long River Chinese Restaurant (631-544-4666). Its standard Chinese menu and some Japanese dishes are supplemented with weekly specials like crispy steak, lamb dishes and fresh steamed and fried fish. Charlie Hung, the chef and owner, also runs the Panda Restaurant in Fort Salonga.</p>
