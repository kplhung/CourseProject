        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We are pleased that Douglas Davis paid so much careful attention to the Web as a medium for art galleries and museums in his article ''The Virtual Museum, Imperfect but Promising'' [Sept. 24]. At the Lehman College Art Gallery in the Bronx, we have been deeply involved with this medium since 1994, when we commissioned ''The World's First Collaborative Sentence'' by Mr. Davis as part of his exhibition ''InterActions.'' Since that time we have cared for and maintained this unique work, permitting hundreds of thousands of contributions in many languages all over the world. Even now, though the work is in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art, we continue to perform this service.</p>

        <p>We strongly believe the Web ought to be engaged on a creative level, not simply as an extension of public relations or the press release, and that artists should be commissioned and encouraged to create new works for a medium that has an unparalleled reach.</p>
