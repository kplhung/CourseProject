        <p>Some say there is a dead man running in the race for Rhode Island's United States Senate seat.</p>
        <p>They have a certain point. The seat belonged for 23 years to John H. Chafee, the widely revered Republican senator who died of heart failure last October, and he remains a palpable presence in the closely contested race as his son, Lincoln, who was appointed to the seat after his death, vies to win it under his own power.</p>

        <p>Some say there is a dead man running in the race for Rhode Island's United States Senate seat.</p>
        <p>They have a certain point. The seat belonged for 23 years to John H. Chafee, the widely revered Republican senator who died of heart failure last October, and he remains a palpable presence in the closely contested race as his son, Lincoln, who was appointed to the seat after his death, vies to win it under his own power.</p>
        <p>The 47-year-old Mr. Chafee is using as his campaign slogan, ''A tradition of trust,'' which many read as,  ''Following in my dad's footsteps.'' And, from campaign volunteers to run-of-the-mill Rhode Islanders, when his supporters are asked their motivation, they tend to get around to mentioning the elder Chafee within a few sentences.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Chafee's Democratic opponent, Representative Bob Weygand, 52, says his greatest campaign challenge is getting voters to distinguish between Lincoln Chafee and his late father. To that end, he said, he has been pushing for the greatest possible number of debates, and the two have agreed to hold eight by Election Day.</p>
        <p>''That's why I want the debates --  when they see the two of us standing up and talking about the issues, and when they understand who understands more about the issues, and who sides with them on the policy, then we win,'' Mr. Weygand said  after a recent debate on WHJJ Talk Radio.</p>
        <p>While the debates may work in Mr. Weygand's favor in some ways, however, they also highlight another problem for him: Rhode Island may be an overwhelmingly Democratic state, but Mr. Chafee's positions and voting record contain little -- very little -- to alienate him from Democratic voters.</p>
        <p>In fact, in a survey taken at the end of August, pollsters for Brown University and The Providence Journal found that Mr. Chafee did extremely well in traditionally Democratic sectors, like union members and the elderly.</p>
        <p>''My sense is that Chafee is the clear front-runner in this race,'' said Darrell M. West, director of the Taubman Center for Public Policy at Brown University, though ''the race will probably get closer as we get near Election Day.''</p>
        <p>It may get closer in part because both parties are investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in television commercials for the two campaigns; Senate Democrats and Republicans say the race is a high priority for them. Other forces are also at work, including a Washington environmental group, the League of Conservation Voters, which has been running advertisements in favor of Mr. Chafee, saying his voting record is better than Mr. Weygand's on environmental issues.</p>
        <p>In some ways, if a voter were to close his eyes and try to guess which candidate was Democratic and which Republican just by their positions, he might have quite a hard time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chafee, the Republican, is for abortion rights while Mr. Weygand, the Democrat, is opposed to abortion in most cases. Mr. Weygand voted with just 30 other House Democrats to begin the inquiry into President Clinton's impeachment. Mr. Chafee, for his part, is the closest thing to a Democrat among the Senate Republicans: a Congressional Quarterly study in June found that he had broken the party line more than any other Republican senator, voting with Democrats on issues from gun control to tax cuts to the environment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weygand, too, is known for breaking with his party leaders. He has clashed on various issues with leading Rhode Island Democrats, including United States Representative Patrick J. Kennedy.</p>
        <p>Over the weekend, Mr. Kennedy did announce his support for Mr. Weygand, but, Dr. West said,  ''there's no love lost between the two, and Patrick doesn't seem to be going out of his way to work very hard for Weygand.''</p>
        <p>In some areas, however, the differences between the two candidates do tend to fall along more typical party lines. At the talk radio debate, Mr. Weygand supported the Clinton administration's recent decision to dip into the nation's petroleum reserves in an effort to lower home heating prices this winter, while Mr. Chafee maintained that the reserves should be preserved for emergencies.</p>
        <p>On prescription drugs, Mr. Chafee supported a bill sponsored by Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, that would allow the reimportation of drugs from countries where they cost less, while Mr. Weygand supported a Democrat-sponsored proposal to lower prices by making pharmaceutical companies compete to supply drugs covered under Medicare.</p>
        <p>The two men also disagreed here and there about their records. Mr. Chafee served for seven years as the mayor of Warwick, Rhode Island's second largest city, and before that as a councilman there. (And for a while, in his wilder youth, as a farrier shoeing horses on the Canadian race circuit.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Weygand served four terms in the state Legislature, and as lieutenant governor for four years before being elected to the House of Representatives in 1996. (He first won great fame in 1991 when he participated in a federal sting on a corrupt Rhode Island mayor.)</p>
        <p>Each record brought jibes; Mr. Chafee accused Mr. Weygand of being unable to work with Republican colleagues, a charge Mr. Weygand rejected; Mr. Weygand said that on issues like the marriage penalty and inheritance tax, Mr. Chafee ''supports and votes for bills that support multimillionaires,'' while he supported the common people. He also accused Mr. Chafee of siding with big oil and drug companies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chafee, for his part, accused Mr. Weygand of descending into campaign mudslinging in the Democratic primary, exclaiming, ''What a disservice to voters that campaign was!''</p>
        <p>Outside the radio station, a handful of supporters for each candidate had assembled, and they boiled down the race in their own ways. For all the issues at stake, the Chafee legacy remained central for them.</p>
        <p>''Fighting the Chafee tradition, the Chafee name,'' said Milton Bronstein, a Weygand supporter. ''Bluntly, that's the problem.''</p>
