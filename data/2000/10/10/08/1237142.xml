        <p>EVERYONE strolls the Brooklyn Bridge, or should. The George Washington has its pedestrian devotees, as does the Williamsburg. But what about the other bridges in the city, a total of 2,027, according to The Encyclopedia of New York City? With the right P.R., might tourists be posing for their photos on the Queensborough, the Goethals, the Pulaski?</p>
        <p>Robert Moses had drivers, not walkers, in mind when he built the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, the Triborough and the Henry Hudson, among other spans that offer unlikely strolls. But for the best vistas, the moving car can hardly compare with the footpath. Architecture, exercise, fresh air, it's all there, too, and it's all free. And the simple structure of the act -- getting from here to there, shore to shore -- is inherently satisfying.</p>
        <p>Of course, it's important to choose your bridge-trekking companions with care. A more intimate recreation than you might expect awaits. Suddenly you're over water (mostly), exposed to weather (always), forced to walk a narrow path (sometimes) side by side, high. Who knows, maybe walking bridges can build bridges between us. Above it all, there is always a new perspective.</p>
        <p>On the Cross Bay</p>
        <p>Nobody walks over the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, which connects the Rockaway peninsula to the rest of Queens at Broad Channel. People drive. People bike. People fish. But when my sister, Debra, and I decide to stroll across one warm Saturday, even locals seem surprised.</p>
        <p>''You can't walk over there, can you?'' they ask. Or, ''Why would you want to do that?''</p>
        <p>Having grown up in Rockaway and spent many an hour gazing out the windows of Beach Channel High School at this flattish white span held up with T-shaped steel and concrete girders, I confess it's no design gem. But along with the Marine Parkway-Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge to the west, it's always represented an escape, the route out to the Belt and Southern State Parkways, to Kennedy Airport and the Whitestone, the exit both of us took when leaving home for college.</p>
        <p>Adding to its allure was the boast that a group of local lifeguards regularly leapt off the Cross Bay (among other bridges) for fun. From the center that would be a 55-foot drop, a height intended to let boats pass underneath. This clearance was the reason the bridge was rebuilt to replace the former drawbridge. But up top, the Topsider crowd isn't popular. We arrive to find the fishermen pelting the pleasure craft with lead sinkers.</p>
        <p>''They're supposed to be going through the channel,'' explains a man wearing a rusty nail clipper on a shoelace around his neck. ''Instead, they come over here and muck up our lines.'' This is Johnny McGuire, 57, a ''semiretired'' accountant who has been fishing here off and on for 40 years.</p>
        <p>''But metal sinkers?'' I ask. It seems severe.</p>
        <p>''Aw, that's nothing,'' he replies. ''I once saw a guy get a hook in his cheek. Of course that was at night. Up here at night, it gets crazy.''</p>
        <p>Similar disdain is held for the bikers. Not the casual ones ''wearing regular clothes'' but the ''fancy Spandex types'' that whiz past on the narrow concrete path, upsetting rods and boom boxes, beer bellies and cutting boards, buckets, coolers, folding chairs, umbrellas and makeshift tents held up by bungee cords.</p>
        <p>''Spanish, Irish, African-American, Indian, there's all types up here,'' Johnny says. ''But we all unite against illegal bikers and boaters and save our beer cans for the homeless.'' Since the government cleaned up the water in the 1970's, he adds, ''I've logged 17 kinds of fish and 30 kinds of beer.''</p>
        <p>Never mind that porgies are the only fish being caught. Never mind that more than one sign says ''No Fishing Permitted.'' This bridge clearly belongs to these fellows.</p>
        <p>Facing Rockaway to the south, I watch the shuttle train leave 116th Street station, travel east along the blue stripe of ocean, disappear behind an abandoned courthouse and reappear to bend north over the train bridge and meet the A at Broad Channel. Beyond the train, planes take off and land at Kennedy, where Eddie Colazzo loads luggage for Air France.</p>
        <p>''When I'm not fishing, of course,'' he says. ''Now I'm fishing so I don't look at planes.'' Instead, he adjusts his pink sunglasses and reels in another porgy. It's only 10 a.m., but he already has a bucketful. And even though there are now regulations (only 50 porgies a day, no smaller than three inches), he'll stay eight hours or more, as is the custom. ''At night, no,'' he adds. ''At night it's too crazy.''</p>
        <p>''What does that mean, crazy?'' Debra asks when we hear about the craziness yet a third time, as a warning from Tomas Gonzalez, a retired postal worker, never to come here after dark. ''Crazy how? Tell me the craziest thing that ever happened.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gonzalez removes his baseball cap and winks. ''Lady comes up here, she flirts with me. Me! An old man!''</p>
        <p>The blue of the sky deepens the higher the eye travels. Clouds are strewn everywhere like shredded tissues. To the west, past six lanes of traffic is the Marine Parkway Bridge, which is also walkable; the Verrazano, upon which only marathoners are allowed to tread; the vibrant green marshes that lead into the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Preserve, and then, like outsized sand castles, the whole of downtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''Think of that view at night!'' I say with a laugh. ''If we dared.''</p>
        <p>''It's not that bad,'' offers the lone fisherwoman, Teresa Peasen. ''I just bring my brother-in-law in case it gets crazy. Once I caught a 10-pound flounder. There's lots more kinds of fish at night.''</p>
        <p>Everyone agrees. Blackfish. Bluefish. Fluke. Jack Creval. Cobia. Johnny claims he bagged a 29-pound skate. Only when it comes to cooking do opinions vary. To marinate or not to marinate? To soak fillets in milk? Pan-fry or deep-fry?</p>
        <p>''You can't leave without reeling one in yourself,'' Johnny tells me when he's got something new on his line.</p>
        <p>The bridge rail is so high, I can't see anything but the reel I'm turning. On the end of my line there might be a plastic bag or a clump of seaweed and mussels, both of which line the walkway. Surprise! It's a too-small brown porgy. A $75 fine if I'm caught not throwing her back. (And imagine you're one of the Jet Skiers or boaters below watching a fish falling 50 feet into the bay.)</p>
        <p>Before going home, we duck into Bridge Bait and Tackle, a tiny, cavelike store crammed with big guys talking fish and tacking Polaroids of big catches to the walls.</p>
        <p>''Crazy how?'' shouts one regular in dark sunglasses. ''I'm up there every night. Do I look crazy?''</p>
        <p>I jingle the car keys. It's time to escape back over the bridge.</p>
        <p>On the Triborough: Bridges Everywhere</p>
        <p>''Here is one of the few places where one can see New York across a foreground of verdure and water, and it must be counted one of the most dazzling urban views in the world,'' Lewis Mumford wrote of the Triborough Bridge's longest span, which connects Astoria, Queens, to Wards Island. It's true. We can see all the way up the East River, from Harlem to Brooklyn. As usual, the Chrysler Building outsparkles everything.</p>
        <p>''Isn't this great?'' I ask my husband, Michael, who shouts back, ''What?'' That's the answer to every question up here. Even on a Sunday, it's that noisy.</p>
        <p>I repeat. ''Is this great?''</p>
        <p>''No,'' he misunderstands aloud. ''Hell Gate!'' referring to the turbulent waters below or to the gracefully arcing bridge to our backs. Who knows?</p>
        <p>Including the Hell Gate and the other spokes of the Triborough, there are, by my count, 10 bridges in view: the Whitestone, the Kosciusko, the 59th Street, the Manhattan, the two connecting Manhattan to Wards and Roosevelt Islands and a hint of the Verrazano. And yet we're all alone.</p>
        <p>''Whoa!''</p>
        <p>There is barely a railing between the 143-foot drop and us. The Hell Gate waters, where the East and Harlem Rivers intersect, have currents that inexplicably flow north. The olive green water spins with riptides, froths with whitecaps. If you dropped something through the drainage grates checkering the walkway, it would fall all the way down, I notice, clutching my wallet. If you fell in. . . . ?</p>
        <p>When especially large vehicles pass, the whole walkway and even the spotlights vibrate. Maybe this is why no one is up here. Maybe people tend to associate the Triborough with deafening traffic jams en route to work. Where the walkway begins, it's level with traffic. We looked up to see a cement truck hurtling toward us, only two feet to our right. But the fact of our being on a Sunday stroll made it a rush rather than a rush hour, a prelude to climbing the small stairway to limbo.</p>
        <p>Out of nowhere, a red balloon bounces by.</p>
        <p>Michael is shouting something that I mistake to mean, ''Paint job.'' The blue-gray bridge could use one.</p>
        <p>''How about pink?'' I yell back.</p>
        <p>Then I see the painter up ahead hunched over his canvas with a tiny brush. He's adding a window to a dead-on pastel architectural rendering of Midtown. On his face, two pairs of glasses are held together with what looks like gum to make bifocals.</p>
        <p>''Sure,'' he says when I ask if he sees people walking this span often.</p>
        <p>On Wards and Randalls Islands, where Robert Moses ruled the city for so many years, an interchange and two toll plazas somehow sort traffic into a dozen directions. But on foot we're alone again, admiring the incredible feet of engineering from a gorgeous rocky shore facing Queens.</p>
        <p>In his biography of Moses, ''The Power Broker,'' Robert A. Caro describes the mind-boggling plan to build it:</p>
        <p>''The steel towers of that bridge would each be higher than a football field standing on end, and it was that bridge's anchorages, in whose concrete would be embedded cables made up of enough wire to circle the globe twice around, that were as big as pyramids.'' And to think that this giant structure, with 835,000 tons of steel, was already under way when Moses realized that no one had planned an approach road.</p>
        <p>Even on the ground, we can hear the massive structure creak and groan, along with the whooshing of traffic high up in the air. Otherwise, silence. All this open space in a city jammed with people would be eerie if I were by myself. Only buoy flags to wave at us from two tiny islands and a police boat.</p>
        <p>''Where is everyone?'' I ask when we're back on the bridge. Then I remember what his answer will be.</p>
        <p>''What?''</p>
        <p>Forget it.</p>
        <p>Suddenly a biker rides past, followed by an elderly gentleman with two golf clubs.</p>
        <p>''A golfer, a biker, a painter, a red balloon,'' Michael shouts. But that I learn later. Now it's my turn to say, ''What?''</p>
        <p>On the Henry Hudson: The 'Other' Uptown Crossing</p>
        <p>My father, Marvin, is upset about the paint peeling on the Henry Hudson Bridge, big slices of blue attached to chunks of rust. ''A disgrace!'' he says.</p>
        <p>The one day in recent memory that he's not wearing his favorite orange neon vest he has us crossing four lanes of traffic to get from the bridge's walkway to its toll plaza. There, Louis Ponce, the operations supervisor, assures him that despite the lack of evidence, a new paint job ''is absolutely in progress.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ponce says he doesn't see many pedestrians. He's bemused, if not perplexed, by our enthusiasm. Walking the bridge is part of his job, not something he'd do voluntarily. In the Robert Moses spirit, he prefers to drive.</p>
        <p>''Anyone ever talk about Moses around the M.T.A. office?'' I wonder aloud. About as much as they talk about Henry Hudson, I gather from the way Mr. Ponce laughs.</p>
        <p>The elegant steel arch bridge was the grand finale of Moses' visionary and controversial ''West Side Improvement.'' Linking northern Manhattan to the Bronx at Riverdale, it created an uninterrupted route from lower Manhattan to Westchester and eased traffic problems considerably.</p>
        <p>But it did not go up without a fight. Reformers and conservationists were outraged that construction would slice through Inwood Hill Park, Manhattan's last remaining wilderness. Bronxites foresaw the end of Spuyten Duyvil as a sleepy, picturesque waterfront village for lower-income families. Perfectly reasonable and even preferable alternatives were devised. That was Moses' cue, not to listen but to act fast.</p>
        <p>''While most Riverdalians were asleep,'' Robert Caro writes, ''the six seven-foot-wide steel spans that would hold the roadbed of the bridge rumbled up Broadway on huge flat floats pulled by tractors, and at 5:55 the last rivet securing them in place over Broadway was set; when Riverdalians went to work in the morning, there before them was a bridge where none had existed the night before.''</p>
        <p>Within a year, traffic demanded that a second level be built. The bridge was deemed a ''success.''</p>
        <p>''It does look sturdy, though,'' Dad says as we stand on one of the three triangular perches created by the graceful design. From this vantage point, you can see the crisscrossed girders of the bridge itself, rising out of the murky Army-green Harlem River. In the foreground, a swing bridge is swung open into three independent units. In the background, the lush Palisades cliffs make the boats of a small marina look like toys. It's windy on the walkway, but nothing is moving in the view except a few seagulls.</p>
        <p>As usual, I'm asking why. Why are we the only ones here? Is it because biking is prohibited? It's Monday? Too humid? Is it because getting to the walkway from Manhattan requires hiking up the long, steep Inwood Hill on what feels like a country road lined with wild grape vines and purple-berried sumac?</p>
        <p>Is it the foliage the crowds are waiting for, the thick stands of pin and red oak? Or is it that no one knows it's possible to stand in the very place where, in 1609, Henry Hudson's three-masted ship, the Half Moon, sailed in search of his illusory northwest passage? Ask anyone in Riverdale or northern Manhattan how to get to ''the bridge,'' and they'll start giving directions to the nearby George Washington.</p>
        <p>With only 2,029 feet between abutments, the Henry Hudson does not have the G.W.'s length or grandeur. You can walk across it in minutes. There is fencing between viewer and view. From the cars, level with the walkway, drivers seem stunned by the sight of pedestrians. One driver rolls down his window and, despite the presence of my father, shouts a pickup line at me.</p>
        <p>And yet beyond the cars, I can see all the way to Columbia University's Wien Stadium at 218th Street and Broadway. If there were people in the stands, they'd be visible too. The fabulous domed top of the new planetarium shines, even in today's minimal sun.</p>
        <p>Slowly, I feel that old bridge buzz coming on; something opens up in your chest and you begin daydreaming. Up high, it's easy to envision Manhattan as it once was, a vast forested shoreline, an island without bridges. Here might be the cove on which Hudson's longboat crew battled the Algonquins. Here, where they smoked peace pipes under a giant tulip tree. On the grassy banks of the Bronx, Spuyten Duyvil is no longer sleepy or picturesque. But, squinting, I can almost ignore the ugly train station and apartment buildings. Water and hills, sky and trees, the geography remains.</p>
        <p>Neither Hudson nor Moses were team players. The former was set adrift to die by mutineers. The latter now has a bad reputation. Standing on the bridge built by one, named for the other, I like to think the two dreamers would have been well matched, if not as friends, at least as fierce foes.</p>
        <p>Surely I wouldn't be standing here, 142 feet in the air, examining the peeling paint with my father, without them.</p>
        <p>'' 'A Bridge Away' is one of our titles,'' Dad reminds me, referring to the list of good titles he and my mother have kept through the years, a sort of game they play. ''You want to be somewhere else? It's always just a bridge away.''</p>
