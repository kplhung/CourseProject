        <p>Chuck Knoblauch has been out of the starting lineup for the last three playoff games, and he has indicated that he accepts the decision of Yankees Manager Joe Torre. Meanwhile, his approach to pregame workouts has changed radically.</p>
        <p>He has stopped taking ground balls, and after taking batting practice before Game 4 last night, he stood behind the batting cage and talked with a reporter for more than half an hour as teammates completed the hourlong workout. He then spoke with a few people in the stands. Such a pregame workout is highly unusual.</p>
        <p>When asked why he had not been taking grounders, Knoblauch replied: ''For what? If I'm not playing, I'm not going to throw out my arm. Today was the only day I didn't really do anything.''</p>
        <p>Torre said he was aware of what Knoblauch did; he would not say whether he intended to speak to Knoblauch about it.</p>
        <p>Can Knoblauch be ready if he is not taking grounders?</p>
        <p>''I hope so,'' Torre replied. ''Let's put it that way -- I hope so.''</p>
