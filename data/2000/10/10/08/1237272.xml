        <p>Former Miami Dolphins Coach Don Shula says St Louis Rams are biggest threat to Dolphins 17-0 undefeated season in 1972 (M)</p>

        <p>The St. Louis Rams, a point-scoring machine, have captured the attention of almost everyone associated with professional football. They have awed a hard-core league that has been there and done that. And no one is paying closer attention to the defending Super Bowl champions than the Hall of Fame Coach Don Shula.</p>
        <p>Shula coached the 1972 Miami Dolphins team that went 14-0 in the regular season and 17-0 over all after winning Super Bowl VII. Those Dolphins are the only undefeated, untied championship team in National Football League history.

        <p>The St. Louis Rams, a point-scoring machine, have captured the attention of almost everyone associated with professional football. They have awed a hard-core league that has been there and done that. And no one is paying closer attention to the defending Super Bowl champions than the Hall of Fame Coach Don Shula.</p>
        <p>Shula coached the 1972 Miami Dolphins team that went 14-0 in the regular season and 17-0 over all after winning Super Bowl VII. Those Dolphins are the only undefeated, untied championship team in National Football League history. It is one of the most impressive achievements in sports and is considered by many in the league to be impossible to duplicate.</p>
        <p>But Shula thinks the Rams, who finished the 1999 regular season at 13-3 and won the Super Bowl, are the biggest threat to the mark set by his Dolphins nearly three decades ago.</p>
        <p>The Rams are making Shula, one of the calmest coaches ever, a tad nervous -- and the Rams have played only a third of their schedule. ''The Rams have the best shot of maybe any team since ours to go undefeated,'' Shula said. ''They have an unbelievable offense. Another reason why is because of the division they are in. They play six games against New Orleans, Atlanta and Carolina, and those teams are struggling. That gives a great team like the Rams an advantage.</p>
        <p>''The numbers the Rams are putting up are scary, really something. I watch them very closely, because I don't think many teams will come close to beating them, so that obviously means late in the season, they might be 10-0 or 13-0. That's when I will be paying attention even more.''</p>
        <p>The 1934 and '42 Chicago Bears went 13-0 and 11-0, respectively, but lost league championship games. There were also four unbeaten teams that had at least one tie: the 1920 Akron Pros (6-0-3) of the American Professional Football Association; the '22 Canton Bulldogs (10-0-2); the '23 Canton Bulldogs (11-0-1); and the '29 Green Bay Packers (12-0-1).</p>
        <p>The Dolphins were the 1970's equivalent of the Rams, steamrollering teams with a great passing game and a solid ground attack. Teams found it impossible to stop all facets of Miami's offense. Sound familiar?</p>
        <p>If the Rams go without a loss, it would be special, but it should not be viewed as being as significant as Miami's perfect season. The Rams will have played two more regular-season games, but the Dolphins played in a league that was not as diluted by expansion. Competition was stiffer.</p>
        <p>And if the Rams go 16-0, they will have home-field advantage in the playoffs. The Dolphins, because of a rotating playoff-site system, played the American Football Conference title game in Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins also won with defense. The 1972 team had three shutouts and allowed a league-low 171 points. St. Louis has had no need for defense because of its remarkable offense, but if the team does get into a close postseason game, which is likely, the Rams' defense is mediocre. St. Louis has given up 145 points, fourth-highest in the league, and the defense is ranked a measly 28th.</p>
        <p>Only a handful of teams have threatened the record, including the 1991 Washington Redskins (14-2), the '85 Chicago Bears (15-1) and the '90 Giants (13-3), all of which won their Super Bowl. The team that has come closest was Denver (14-2) in 1998, which climbed to 13-0 before losing to the Giants, 20-16.</p>
        <p>The Rams would have it tougher than Miami in this sense: The news media attention leading up to a 16-0 record would be crushing. Every day St. Louis players would have a dozen microphones and cameras in their faces. Broncos players were actually relieved at losing because they hated all the extra attention.</p>
        <p>But why is Shula now getting twitchy about the Rams? The team is only 5-0. Can't a lot happen between now and football immortality?</p>
        <p>Yes, but Shula has a right to be concerned, because of the way St. Louis is winning. The Rams are overwhelming teams with speed, multiple formations and smart coaching. Against a good San Diego defense last week, the Rams had 57 points and 614 yards. The team is averaging 43.4 points and has scored at least 30 points in a league-record 11 consecutive regular-season games.</p>
        <p>Shula does see a handful of traps for the Rams. Kansas City, Minnesota and Tampa Bay are all potentially tough games for St. Louis. ''I'll be watching,'' he said. ''Very closely.''</p>
        <p>Right Move by Green</p>
        <p>Few winning head coaches in the N.F.L. have been criticized as much as Minnesota's Dennis Green. His self-confidence is viewed as arrogance by some. There were questions about why the owner, Red McCombs, extended Green's contract through the 2004 season, even though Green has never had a losing season as the Vikings coach. Minnesota is also the only team in the league to reach at least the divisional round of the playoffs the last three seasons.</p>
        <p>But Green faced probably his largest number of critics when he decided during the past off-season to turn over the offense to the second-year quarterback Daunte Culpepper. Now, both Culpepper and Green are proving the decision was anything but foolhardy.</p>
        <p>Besides Minnesota's defense, which has been surprisingly good, Culpepper's success is the biggest reason the Vikings are 4-0 entering today's game against Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>Yet few should be surprised. Green's passing offense has long been one of the best in football because almost any quarterback can be inserted in it and perform well. Some of the recent Vikings quarterbacks have been Rich Gannon, Warren Moon, Jim McMahon, Brad Johnson, Randall Cunningham and Jeff George. It was the system that helped to specifically regenerate the careers of Cunningham and George.</p>
        <p>Culpepper, who has completed 61.5 percent of his passes and has an 87.9 passer rating, along with 198 rushing yards, second among quarterbacks, is the latest thrower to take advantage of a simple scheme that is extremely quarterback-friendly. He also has great receivers to throw to in Cris Carter and Randy Moss.</p>
        <p>''We knew he could be our leader,'' Green said of Culpepper. ''We're very happy with how he has played. He's only going to get better.''</p>
        <p>The Parcells Method</p>
        <p>The Jets privately play down any significance, but the team thinks it may have solved some of quarterback Vinny Testaverde's recent throwing problems by adjusting his classroom schedule.</p>
        <p>When Bill Parcells was coaching, Testaverde was given the game plan piecemeal over the course of the week. Coach Al Groh changed that and began giving Testaverde the game plan in one chunk at midweek.</p>
        <p>Testaverde liked Parcells's method better. Recently, the coaching staff went back to it, and the Jets think that that will make Testaverde more comfortable during the game.</p>
        <p>Teams do things differently but most put together the game plan on Tuesday and then give it to the players on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>In his book ''The Final Season,'' Parcells writes that Testaverde would put the offensive plays on a wristband as a memory aid, and during the week, study the game plan almost every day.</p>
        <p>Panthers' Woes</p>
        <p>The harsh times for the Carolina Panthers continued last week when the offensive coordinator, Bill Musgrave, blindsided the organization by resigning, saying it was better for the team.</p>
        <p>Musgrave's jumping ship coincides almost two years to the day when, after four games, quarterback Kerry Collins removed himself from the lineup, saying his heart was not in it.</p>
        <p>It has been a rough stretch for the Panthers. The former Panther Rae Carruth has been accused of plotting the murder of his pregnant girlfriend and the former running back Fred Lane was shot to death by his wife.</p>
        <p>And if all of that is not bad enough, Carolina, a team some believed would be a playoff team, is just 1-3.</p>
