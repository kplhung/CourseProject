        <p>By nearly any economic measure, India is a country with multitudes of poor people, but precisely how many? The attempt to answer that question has sparked a vigorous debate in recent months among some of the country's leading economists.</p>
        <p>The question is not purely academic. Recent government surveys -- including a big one released last week have not produced solid data about whether poverty has declined in the 1990's, when the state loosened its grip on the economy and opened the door to international trade.</p>
        <p>The statistical muddle has made it difficult to judge whether faster economic growth and increased spending on anti-poverty programs have, in fact, bettered the lot of the poor.</p>
        <p>The results of India's 1999 survey of household consumption, released last week, found that about a quarter of the country's population of one billion people lives below the poverty line -- substantially lower than the more than a third consistently found in similar government surveys taken in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>But Pravin Visaria, the economist who has overseen the surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Organization since 1991, cautioned that while the 1999 poverty measurements are the most accurate to date, they cannot be compared with the results from earlier years because of changes in the methodology of the survey.</p>
        <p>''It is not correct to call this a decline in poverty so much as a better measurement of poverty,'' said Mr. Visaria, who is director of the government-funded Institute of Economic Growth in New Delhi.</p>
        <p>Poverty is tricky to measure and India's recent experience is an object lesson in the complexities of the task. In the National Sample Survey Organization's previous large-scale survey of 120,000 households, conducted in 1993 and 1994, investigators asked people how much food they had consumed in the prior 30 days.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Visaria had already begun to wonder whether people could accurately remember. ''Can you tell me what you ate eight days ago?'' he asked recently. ''Do you keep a diary? I don't.'' He worried that people were understating how much they ate and that India -- the only country to use such a measure -- was overstating its poverty rate.</p>
        <p>So in subsequent years, while conducting smaller annual surveys, he  asked one group of households how much they had eaten in the previous 30 days and another what they had eaten in the prior 7 days.</p>
        <p>The difference was staggering. In 1998, for example, the rate of poverty in the households that answered the 30 day question was 39.9 percent; the rate for those who answered the 7 day question was 22.6 percent.</p>
        <p>So when it came time to conduct another large-scale survey last year, it was decided that all the households surveyed would be asked both the 30 day and the 7 day questions, in that order. The results were, again, startling. Using the answers to the 30 day question as a guide, 26.9 percent of the households were poor; using the 7 day question, 24.4 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Visaria now believes India has a truer measure of its poor -- but the answer does not solve the puzzle about whether poverty has declined in the past decade, or by how much.</p>
        <p>''It's a very difficult situation,'' said Stephen Howes, an economist at the World Bank in New Delhi. ''No one is sure what's happening. And that makes it difficult to have a discussion about the success of Indian economic policies in bringing down poverty.''</p>
        <p>Most economists -- both on the right and the left -- say they believe that poverty has fallen in the 1990's as it did in the 1980's, though they disagree about how much. The country's growth rate, which averaged 5.8 percent in the 1980's, has clocked an average of 6.5 percent since 1991. Per capita income has continued to grow at 3 to 4 percent a year. The population is also becoming more literate.</p>
        <p>Surveys of household income, conducted by the National Council for Applied Economic Research, a private organization, found that poverty had declined to 18 percent in 1998 from 39 percent a decade earlier.</p>
        <p>''Economic growth matters,'' said Surjit Bhalla, a former World Bank economist who is now an investment fund manager in New Delhi. ''In my view, nothing else does. Certainly the anti-poverty programs of the government don't matter.''</p>
        <p>But Jean Dreze, a professor at the Delhi School of Economics who has co-written books with the Nobel-prize winning economist Amartya Sen, said he believes growth in the 1990's may have been offset to some extent by widening inequalities. The states in the south and west with higher literacy and more nimble leaders are springing ahead, while the poorer, more backward states in the north are lagging badly, he said.</p>
        <p>''The impression one gets is that there has been progress in the 1990's,'' he said. ''After all, the economy has been growing fast. But there are also signs of growing income inequality.''</p>
