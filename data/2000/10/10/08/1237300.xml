        <p>With the national elections heading into the home stretch, the federal government suspended two old regulations that had required radio and television stations to provide free reply time to candidates and others attacked on the airwaves.</p>
        <p>Broadcasters have called for repeal of the rules, the last major vestiges of the fairness doctrine, because they say the rules discourage them from airing controversial issues.</p>
        <p>In response to a lawsuit filed by the broadcasters, the Federal Communications Commission decided to suspend the rules for 60 days to test whether they do chill debate, and whether, in their absence, the broadcasters increase their coverage of politics.</p>
