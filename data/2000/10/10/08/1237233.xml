        <p>As the wife of a man who is a loving and devoted father to his two children by a previous marriage, I have watched in dismay as the courts and the system treat him as not much better than a criminal. It is assumed that he is guilty, negligent, delinquent and not interested in the children's welfare. As a feminist, I never imagined I'd be championing the rights of a group of men, but injustice and prejudice know no gender.</p>
