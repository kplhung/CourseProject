        <p>IT was the type of gossip that makes Broadway aficionados pant: a show doctor was being brought in to ''Seussical,'' the $8.5 million musical based on Dr. Seuss characters, to rework it just weeks before the first Broadway preview later this month. It was Broadway's biggest news of the day and it broke on Broadway.com.</p>
        <p>Broadway.com is just one of a batch of increasingly visible Web sites devoted to the theater and theater news, each with its own critics, souvenir shops and catty backstage chat. With dozens of sites of various size and function, the online theater community is offering a brand new way to express love -- or hate -- for the theater.</p>

        <p>IT was the type of gossip that makes Broadway aficionados pant: a show doctor was being brought in to ''Seussical,'' the $8.5 million musical based on Dr. Seuss characters, to rework it just weeks before the first Broadway preview later this month. It was Broadway's biggest news of the day and it broke on Broadway.com.</p>
        <p>Broadway.com is just one of a batch of increasingly visible Web sites devoted to the theater and theater news, each with its own critics, souvenir shops and catty backstage chat. With dozens of sites of various size and function, the online theater community is offering a brand new way to express love -- or hate -- for the theater.</p>
        <p>The sites are far from perfect, though, and producers complain that many times the news items posted turn out to be unfounded rumors. But the sites do promise to change the way theater audiences shop, as many offer discount ticket clubs. In addition, they provide a path for Broadway producers to reach fans outside of New York. In a noncommercial vein, the Web allows nonprofit theater-related groups a way to provide services (like grant information) and trade publications a means to get audition notices distributed faster.</p>
        <p>Following are descriptions of some major sites:</p>
        <p>NEWS AND INFORMATION  Playbill Online  www.playbill.com</p>
        <p>The online equivalent of the venerable paper program distributed in many New York theaters. The site presents breaking theater news for New York, the regional theater circuit and overseas, as well as electronic versions of Playbill's hard-copy articles. Special features include a popular discount ticket club, job listings and columns like ''Diva Talk!'' (''Betty on Sondheim; Bernadette on Life'' -- referring to the musical stage stars Betty Buckley and Bernadette Peters).</p>
        <p>Broadway.com  www.broadway.com</p>
        <p>Inaugurated in May, Broadway.com is in fierce competition with Playbill Online and Theatre.com (see below). It even hired away Ken Mandelbaum, the gossip columnist at Theatre.com whose work formerly appeared in the now-defunct In Theater magazine.</p>
        <p>Beside the basics -- listings, reviews, blind items -- the site also promises a show tune search engine, streaming video and boutique ('' 'Jesus Christ Superstar' Revival Poster: Now Only $16.99!'').</p>
        <p>Theatre.com  www.theatre.com</p>
        <p>This site presents many of the same listings and services as Broadway.com and Playbill.com, though it tends to break less news. There is a comprehensive listing of awards -- the Oscars, the Pulitzer, the Theater Library Association -- and individual pages devoted to theatrical news from more than 25 cities across the country.</p>
        <p>Theatermania  www.theatremania.com</p>
        <p>Another site begun this year. An early promotional concept involved an actor in a giant purple wig -- the Theatermaniac -- who stalked Broadway openings and the reduced-price TKTS booth in Times Square.</p>
        <p>The emphasis now seems to be on selling, with extensive show listings nationwide for everything from ''Annie Get Your Gun'' to ''Yerma.'' Editorial content consists of features, reviews and chat room exchanges.</p>
        <p>Culture Finder  www.culturefinder.com</p>
        <p>A wide-ranging list site that includes dance, opera and other cultural offerings. Unlike several other sites, Culturefinder exhibits a sense of humor: there are baseball-card-style thumbnail sketches of prominent theater folk (the Drama All-Stars), including career highlights, career totals and scouting reports.</p>
        <p>Backstage.com  www.backstage.com</p>
        <p>The Web site for the weekly trade paper, with access to stories from the West Coast edition. Good coverage of labor issues and, of course, casting notices. Hefty listings of thespian services, including acting coaches and temporary jobs. It will also post an actor's headshot and resume, for a fee.</p>
        <p>Show Business Weekly  www.showbusinessweekly.com</p>
        <p>Positioning itself as the main competition for Backstage, this recently revitalized upstart offers a similar range of listings, audition notices and actor services on newsstands. The Web site does the same.</p>
        <p>CHAT ROOMS</p>
        <p>All That Chat  www.TalkinBroadway.com/forum</p>
        <p>A popular site with musical fans, including some actually employed in the industry. As a result, there can be scoops about casting and struggling shows. It also offers a goodly amount of deep discussion as to the greatest show tune in history and such existential debates as Sondheim v. Wildhorn. Its home site, Talkin' Broadway, provides rundowns on Broadway plays, cabaret reviews and a link to the still-developing Internet Theater database (ITdb), which aims to present reference information on the world of theater.</p>
        <p>Theater Chat Room  www.deja.com/group/rec.arts. theatre.musicals</p>
        <p>An electronic forum that includes a variety of chat room discussions on topics ranging from public financing of the arts to whether Marin Mazzie would be the correct choice to star in a revival of ''Mame.''</p>
        <p>BEYOND BROADWAY</p>
        <p>Albemarle of London  www.albemarle-london.com/ news.html</p>
        <p>This Web site for the Albemarle ticket service in London includes comprehensive listings for the West End, off West End and fringe shows. Its unusually accurate gossip site bears the quaintly civilized title ''What's the Rumour?''</p>
        <p>New York Theater Wire  www.nytheatre-wire.com</p>
        <p>A well-executed site, it is also one of the oldest, and focuses on alternative, downtown, out-of-town and way-out-of-town offerings. The Oregon Shakespeare Festival and the Bolshoi Ballet, for example, are the subject of current features.</p>
        <p>New York Theater Experience  www.nytheatre.com</p>
        <p>Run by a nonprofit organization, this is another listings site with good coverage of downtown and Off Off Broadway productions.</p>
        <p>REFERENCE</p>
        <p>Broadway Stars  www.broadwaystars.com</p>
        <p>A compendium of clips from other Web sites, newspapers and trade papers, like Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, and the occasional blind item from a disgruntled cast member.</p>
        <p>The American Theater Web  www.americantheaterweb.com</p>
        <p>This site provides links to the Web pages of 2,300 theater companies in all 50 states. It also includes daily clippings of theater stories and news features from major newspapers around the country.</p>
        <p>On Broadway  www.on-broadway.com</p>
        <p>''The Time Warp,'' a feature at this site, lists what was playing on Broadway from 1990 to the present. There are also season summaries and lists of Tony Award and Drama Desk winners.</p>
        <p>MISCELLANEOUS</p>
        <p>Theatrical Calamities  www.geocities.com/Broadway/8244</p>
        <p>Personal backstage horror stories, from both amateurs and professionals. Categories include ''The Show From Hell: When Everything Goes Wrong'' and ''Live Animals Who Steal the Show.''</p>
        <p>Died On Stage  www.snopes.com/spoons/noose/ dead.htm</p>
        <p>A fascinating -- if morbid -- compilation of some of the show people who drew their last breath on the job.</p>
