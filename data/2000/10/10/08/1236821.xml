        <p>HEROES, ROGUES,</p>
        <p>AND LOVERS</p>
        <p>Testosterone and Behavior.</p>
        <p>By James McBride Dabbs</p>
        <p>with Mary Godwin Dabbs.</p>
        <p>284 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>McGraw-Hill. $24.95.</p>
        <p>What do construction workers, trial lawyers, front-line soldiers, con men and Sam Spade have in common? And what sets them apart from farmers, ministers, nontrial lawyers, exemplary prisoners and the unsociable? Members of the first list, according to James McBride Dabbs, all produce higher levels of the male hormone testosterone than members of the second.</p>
        <p>Testosterone has had a bad rap lately. To many it seems an unmitigated curse. Without it, they suggest, we could rid ourselves of war, violent crime, rape and many other evils. But in ''Heroes, Rogues, and Lovers,'' (written with his wife, Mary Godwin Dabbs) Dabbs, a social psychologist at Georgia State University who has studied the infamous chemical for many years, tells a more complex story.</p>
        <p>Without testosterone we would all be female. A trigger gene on the Y chromosome produces the hormone, causing gonads that would otherwise become ovaries to turn into testes. But there are other sources, and both sexes share the chemical, albeit to differing degrees. Many of Dabbs's most interesting findings come from comparing testosterone levels within rather than between sexes.</p>
        <p>Research was long delayed because levels could be tested only from blood samples, which most people are unwilling to provide. Dabbs learned that saliva gave equally accurate measures, and could thus test thousands of subjects. He found that testosterone levels do not remain constant: they decline by a good 50 percent over a person's life span, are higher in the morning and can be affected by the seasons and by a variety of life experiences. Indeed, Dabbs's research hammers another nail into the coffin of dualism: ''mental'' events can dramatically affect the ''material'' sphere of body chemistry. In an ingenious experiment, Dabbs's students tested 12 Brazilian and 9 Italian sports fans both before and after a World Cup soccer match in which Brazil beat Italy. The Italians produced lower levels after the match (in two cases, 50 percent or more lower); 11 Brazilians produced higher (in one case, 100 percent more). In general, positive feelings increase testosterone levels, negative feelings reduce them.</p>
        <p>But testosterone is after all a sex hormone, and many readers may want to know its effect on their sexual performance. In my youth, popular culture held two conflicting theories: ''the more you use, the more you get'' versus ''you have only so many shots in your locker.'' Dabbs unhesitatingly endorses the first: ''Testosterone increases sex, and sex increases testosterone.'' Yet people with average or even low-normal levels can have satisfactory sex lives; only severe depletion seems to remove both desire and activity.</p>
        <p>Indeed, testosterone may have more influence on aggression and the drive for dominance. Dabbs places the issues in an evolutionary context. The dominant male can protect his mate and offspring and provide more resources, but his reckless lifestyle leads at worst to early death, at best to philandering and neglect of familial duties. The lower-testosterone male may confer less status and excitement yet provide safer and more lasting support. Since widely varying levels of testosterone still exist in humans, both strategies for perpetuating genes must work. But the social downside of the first increases as civilization grows ever more complex and constricting.</p>
        <p>For higher testosterone levels are statistically linked to what Dabbs terms ''rambunctious'' behavior: any activity, from careless smoking to mayhem or murder, that defies social norms. The mix of self-absorption and flamboyance typical of high-testosterone men and women can have charismatic effects: successful actors and trial lawyers often show above-average levels. But high levels yield no guarantee of material success; in general, ''higher testosterone correlates with lower status,'' perhaps, he suggests, because such people are too restless and too easily bored to endure higher education.</p>
        <p>Yet even civilized society may sometimes be glad to have a few high-testosterone characters around. Invaluable in war, they can also confront peacetime emergencies with the certainty of winning and the indifference to personal safety that the hormone bestows. A fireman who hung from a helicopter to effect a daring rescue, a petty criminal who pulled four people from a burning building and a female student who dragged an injured driver from his truck despite fears that it might explode, all turned out to have above-average levels. Fearlessness spells freedom to act, and freedom can go either way, to selfish violence or to pure altruism.</p>
        <p>For while Dabbs subscribes to the main tenets of evolutionary psychology, he does not believe that biology is destiny. ''Circumstance, motivation and values'' will determine how a person responds in any given situation; the ill effects of excessive testosterone can be reduced by ''loving families, good schools and stable communities.'' And in an epilogue he admits that the results of scientific inquiry are far from infallible.</p>
        <p>This makes all the more puzzling a kind of overkill that permeates the book. Everyone likes good stories, and the heroes, rogues and lovers whose capsule histories enrich the text certainly provide entertaining reading. However, nothing indicates that the World War II hero Audie Murphy or the famed trial lawyer Gerry Spence ever offered Dabbs their saliva. It is surer still that Crazy Horse, who is dead, or Sam Spade, who is fictional, never spat for science. Yet all are invoked as exemplars of testosterone-fueled behavior; we are even told of the redoubtable Sam that ''testosterone oozed from his every pore.''</p>
        <p>Dabbs's rationale seems to be that if anyone exhibits those masculine characteristics associated with testosterone, they must be directly attributed to testosterone. But a correlation does not always qualify as a cause. He himself notes puzzling counterexamples: for instance, the Ache, a tribe of Native Americans in Paraguay, show violent behavior despite low testosterone. Perhaps his catholic choice of illustration stems from the need, in any scientific work aimed at a wide audience, to flesh out abstractions with concrete and familiar cases. If, in balancing between sober fact and entertainment, Dabbs sometimes tilts too far toward the latter, the general reader will readily forgive him, thanks to the wealth of fascinating information he provides.</p>
