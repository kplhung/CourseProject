        <p>THE black plumes of smoke rising from Yugoslavia's federal Parliament building as a flag-waving throng storms the building will forever define the Serbian revolution that toppled Slobodan Milosevic. In its way, the image has the force of the photograph of a soldier planting the Soviet flag atop the Reichstag in Berlin in 1945. Both images are overwhelming in their glorious finality.</p>
        <p>But Yevgeny Khaldei's Reichstag photograph was a perfect representation of victory in a bloody war, whereas the iconic images of the end of Mr. Milosevic's 13-year rule seem to offer a partial truth. Without the critical injection of force at a pivotal moment -- the hard men from central Serbia storming past the hesitant police and their tear gas -- the opposition's protests might have proved as ineffectual as they so often had in the past. But Mr. Milosevic was downed less by violent upheaval than by the broad, massive, nonviolent protest that has characterized the fall of so many authoritarian regimes in recent years.</p>
        <p>What goes around comes around. It was always clear that the cycle of war that went out from Belgrade in the early 1990's would one day end where it began. Mr. Milosevic and Balkan stability were always incompatible. But what few predicted was that Serbia might join the Philippines, Chile and the post-Communist states of central Europe in outlining a modern paradigm: revolution through bloodless consensus.</p>
        <p>In this light, Serbia's revolution was perhaps best captured by the failed attempt of the army and its chief, Nebojsa Pavkovic, to break a crippling strike at the Kolubara coal mine this week. Here, a day before the storming of the Parliament, it became clear that the police were unwilling to use force to break up a protest movement that had spread to workers. So by the time that movement entered the Parliament, it was in effect pitted against an enemy that had already indicated a willingness to surrender.</p>
        <p>As in so many recent popular revolts, the falling ruler's fate was sealed as he lost the instruments of power one by one. Mr. Milosevic was stripped first of the television stations he had used so skillfully to stoke Serb nationalism and a brooding sense of victimization; then of the courts he had manipulated, which on Wednesday nullified the election but on Friday pronounced his rival the winner; and finally, of the police and the army.</p>
        <p>''Nonviolent resistance is not a magic wand, it's a strategy,'' said Jack DuVall, the co-author of ''A Force More Powerful: A Century of Nonviolent Conflict'' (St. Martins Press), a new book on peaceful protest. ''The essential thing, as Gandhi saw, is to detach a regime from its means of support. The Serbian opposition understood this, and the critical detachment occurred in the last two weeks.''</p>
        <p>It is not over yet, of course. Serbia's soft revolution is still a muddle. The style of Vojislav Kostunica, the president-elect and a constitutional lawyer who became a revolutionary despite himself, is slow-moving, an advantage in coalition-building but not necessarily in revolution-handling in a state whose borders remain unclear. He is at the apex of a federation whose very existence is in question. He will have to confront the push for independence from Kosovo, still nominally a Serbian province, and a tense standoff with Montenegro, the other republic of the federation.</p>
        <p>Serbia has yet to face the delicate and charged question of how, or whether, it will confront the brutalities of the Milosevic years. Mr. Kostunica is a democrat, but he is also a Serbian nationalist, though not of the virulent strain Mr. Milosevic fostered and exploited. He has shown no inclination to bow to American pressure to deliver Mr. Milosevic to the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, and he has said the question of war crimes by Serbs should be addressed alongside the question of whether NATO too committed them when it bombed Serbia.</p>
        <p>Events could spill in all kinds of directions, including one that might leave Mr. Milosevic and his influential wife, Mira Markovic, no better off than Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, who were executed by their fellow Romanians.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Kostunica has continuously urged restraint, it is because he understands that aggression would merely have played into the hands of a regime that always practiced the politics of violence. Why play on your enemy's terms? That calculation was clear enough.</p>
        <p>BUT what combination of the international zeitgeist and the state of Serbia led Mr. Milosevic to quit (to spend more time with his grandson, he said!) rather than order his forces to open fire and suppress Mr. Kostunica's revolt? After all, he had little hesitation in suppressing Albanian strikers in Kosovo in the late 80's or students in Belgrade in '91.</p>
        <p>One factor is clearly that the post-cold-war rise of the politics of ethics and human rights, after the discrediting of totalitarianism and Communist systems, have limited a strongman's margin for maneuver, especially as any crackdown is instantaneously beamed to a worldwide audience. Global politics and technology are inimical to the use of brutality in ways that are increasingly persuasive and that did not exist in Prague in 1968.</p>
        <p>''The general trend is such that any army commander in a place like Serbia is going to ask: even if we can resist this for one week, scatter the protesters for a few days, what then?'' said Jonathan Eyal, a British strategic analyst. ''In 1945, Communism was a thing of the future. Today you have to ask the point of executing an order to fire.''</p>
        <p>Especially for a man as isolated as Mr. Milosevic. A ruined economy, a lost war in Kosovo, an indictment from the tribunal in The Hague, all led to his progressive alienation from his people and the countries around him. ''Come home to Europe,'' Tony Blair, the British prime minister, exhorted the Serbian people as Mr. Milosevic tottered. Europe, here, was shorthand for human dignity, democracy and the rule of law.</p>
        <p>Such ideas have proved increasingly compelling. Certainly, from the fall of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines in 1986, to the rejection in a plebiscite of the Pinochet regime in Chile in 1987, to Romania in 1989, to the failed Soviet putsch in Moscow in 1991, to Serbia today, a pattern seems clear enough. Once a catalyst has sparked nonviolent protest on a broad scale, the army is not ready to fire -- or go on firing for long enough -- on its own people.</p>
        <p>The exception to this pattern, of course, was at Tiananmen Square, where Chinese authorities quashed the student revolt. No stronger image of passive resistance could be found, or imagined, than the solitary student who stood before a Chinese tank. Yet it proved ineffective. ''The mistake in China was the students' decision to maximize demands before trying to broaden their movement,'' Mr. Duvall argued. ''The success of nonviolent protest ultimately hinges on having a broad base.''</p>
        <p>As Serbs set fire to the federal Parliament building, Gerhard Schroder, Germany's leader, sent a message to the Yugoslav Army and the Serbian police force: ''My appeal -- and I say this as German chancellor on the basis of our experience during the time of the Berlin Wall -- is don't fire on your own people. That would be a tragedy.''</p>
        <p>In fact, it was the fall of the Wall that removed the last bastion -- in Moscow -- that might have given some cover for an act of violent repression by Mr. Milosevic. That is why he persisted for so long in saying that the fall of the Soviet Union was not irreversible.</p>
        <p>AS Mr. Milosevic kept rowing against the tide of history, he increasingly developed a sort of soft dictatorship -- a ''dictablanda'' rather than a ''dictadura.'' This combined elements of a dictatorship -- a powerful secret police, effective control of the media, fear-mongering propaganda, a secretive style of government -- with acts like holding the very presidential election that ultimately led to his fall. His error, in the end, was to believe he could control the vote through the authoritarian methods at his disposal. Once that failed, he was no longer enough of a dictator to hold power by other means.</p>
