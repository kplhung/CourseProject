        <p>THE actress Mary-Louise Parker and the director Joe Mantello have known each other since they were students at the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem. Ms. Parker, who starred in David Auburn's play ''Proof'' last summer at the Manhattan Theater Club, resumes her role on Tuesday, when the production, directed by Daniel Sullivan, begins previews on Broadway at the Walter Kerr Theater, where it opens on Oct. 24. Mr. Mantello, who is currently directing Terrence McNally and Jake Heggie's ''Dead Man Walking'' at the San Francisco Opera, will direct the Roundabout Theater Company production of Noel Coward's ''Design for Living'' later this season in New York.</p>
        <p>Last month, at the request of The New York Times, the two friends met at Ms. Parker's Greenwich Village apartment, where they talked, among other subjects, about acting, directing and audience members who snack during performances. Following are excerpts from their conversation:</p>
        <p>JOE MANTELLO -- I love it when I walk into a theater and there's nothing on the stage. That kind of theater says to an audience: ''We're not filling in all the blanks. You have to meet us halfway.''</p>
        <p>MARY-LOUISE PARKER -- We have become so passive through movies and television, it feels as if entertainment is done to us rather than something we are involved in. Sometimes you get paranoid onstage and think they hate you. And sometimes there is an inexplicable feeling in the room, some kind of union happening with the audience and the actors: everything is quiet, completely silent, and you can hear people breathing.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- The night I saw ''Proof'' I felt the audience, the actors and the play were totally in sync.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- That was a really good night. In a way, when I'm doing the best, that's the time I don't fully remember so much about what I did as much as I remember what the other actors did.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- When I acted, I would stay outside myself a lot, sort of direct myself. It got complicated because ultimately it was harder to surrender control and just do it. I started to watch myself, and then you become aware of rustling in the audience, people talking.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- That's about television; people think they're watching television. They think, ''They can't see me or hear me.'' What they don't know is that when you're onstage, one Tic-Tac coming out of the box sounds like an avalanche.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- Audiences are harangued about this all the time. To me, it's just a gradual erosion of manners in general that's not specific to the theater.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- I have this idea of getting some actors, say two or three for each theater, and working out little skits of people acting out bad audience members, eating or talking on their phones. And just present it for 60 seconds before the play.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- That is genius. That's hilarious.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- But I also think a bad-behaving audience member is the responsibility of other audience members. At one play I went to there was this little kid -- well, he was young but he was a full-grown adult, sitting a few seats down from me eating barbecued potato chips. I glanced at him and he kept eating them. I caught his eye and I shook my finger and he kept eating them. Finally, I  dove over the three people between us and said, ''Will you stop eating those? I'm going to kill you!'' And he stopped. At intermission I said to him, ''The actors can see you, they can hear you.''</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- I look around when stuff like that happens and no one else seems to be noticing.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- I don't think as much as we are, but I think they are. Onstage, you can hear people in the audience shush other people. But I love people who go to the theater and want to be there.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- When you were at school, what did you imagine it was going to be like when you came to New York? Coming from that environment, where it was almost completely actor-driven and there was no money spent on production values even when you would do a production.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- My expectations were very vague. I just thought I would work and I wanted to know who those characters were that I was going to play.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- Did you see yourself in the theater?</p>
        <p>PARKER -- Yeah.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- Or did you see yourself doing movies? Did you see yourself having the career that you have now?</p>
        <p>PARKER -- I saw myself in the theater. I feel like I've gotten some movies by accident. I don't feel I'm a movie actress. I thought I would do theater and I have done theater and I feel like I always will. I've had great experiences in movies and met great people and made good money -- but it's not necessarily who I am. Do you miss acting?</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- I don't at all.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- Because -- and I have to say this -- you gave the first performance I ever saw that I was completely stunned by. I didn't know acting could do that. It was in ''The Homecoming.'' I'd never seen anything like that before because I didn't grow up going to the theater.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- I did. We had a lot of theater in my hometown and I was constantly running from play to play and probably developing lots of bad habits. I was in community theater, but I didn't want my friends to know about it. My English teacher in junior high, who did know and who was probably saying to herself, ''Look at this freaky kid, desperate for attention,'' wrote in my yearbook: ''It was great having you in English class. Have you ever considered a career in the theater?'' Well, it literally was like she wrote, ''I saw you murder your young brother.''</p>
        <p>PARKER -- Really!</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- I was so mortified by it that I scratched it out so other people signing my yearbook would not know that about me.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- Is that because people who did drama in school were weirdos?</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- Absolutely weird.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- Because in my school they were. I remember my fifth-grade teacher in Tennessee -- we were living there for about five minutes -- she said, ''You're so dramatic, Mary-Louise, you should be an actor.'' I don't know why she said that.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- People know.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- I never said, ''I'm going to be an actress,'' ever, ever. I was so shy, like a car wreck socially. And yet I could go onstage and dance the chicken bop in my tutu.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- What is the chicken bop?</p>
        <p>PARKER -- It was this tap dance that I did when I was like 4. Apparently, all the other little girls were crying. I just wanted more lipstick. I was ready to go. No fear.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- That's what I remember about you: no fear. How long have we known each other? Eighteen years? You were two years behind me at the School of the Arts.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- That's right.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- My first impression of you was completely wrong. I have these very clear images of you hanging off your boyfriend Kevin, and for a long time I called you the girl without a spine because you were never standing upright without the support----</p>
        <p>PARKER -- Of one man or another. Or more than one. I was always draped over someone.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- But it was the most amazing thing. It was literally like you were a narcoleptic in a miniskirt. And then you did ''A Doll's House'' and you were so fierce onstage. It was the complete opposite. What do you remember about training in school?</p>
        <p>PARKER -- First I have to say I remember you coming up to me at the first dance and saying----</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- Is it embarrassing?</p>
        <p>PARKER -- No. You said, ''I really love the way you dress.'' I was wearing a blue plaid weird miniskirt with black suede high-top boots and some weird black ripped hose and some weird bra top or something.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- That is embarrassing [laughs].</p>
        <p>PARKER -- I remember being extremely open the first year because I knew nothing, never took an acting class.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- But you had done plays.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- One or two. And I remember then getting really frustrated because the teachers were unhappy with the fact -- remember, we needed to wear black leotards and black tights, and I would kind of personalize my leotards and cut them up in back -- that I could be, not contentious, but I would challenge and ask questions, or I would say, ''I don't understand that'' or ''I don't know what you're talking about.''</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- Remember having to wear black? There was this overriding message that was drummed into our heads about neutrality.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- Totally!</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- You were constantly being asked to check parts of your personality that made you unique and strive for a kind of neutrality. I saw so many people who were astonishing actors, who had unbelievable instincts -- even if they were raw and unformed -- diminished.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- Flattened out.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- Yes. I don't think there was anything sinister behind it. Maybe what we were being trained for was a repertory situation in a regional theater. Once I came to New York I found that the last thing anybody wanted was for me to be neutral. I used to go into auditions with a briefcase and say in a very resonant voice, ''Hello. Joseph Mantello.''</p>
        <p>PARKER -- Oh, my God.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- Just a freak, because I thought that was what I was supposed to do. Consequently, I spent the first several years not working because I lost touch with whatever it was----</p>
        <p>PARKER -- That thing that is in you that made you able to----</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- But I don't think you did. You were the person who was ripping up your leotard. So you always had this sense of yourself, what was unique about you.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- That has probably hurt me sometimes, too. Because there are certain things I don't know that I'll ever be able to do.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- I don't think an actor should be able to do everything. I also think there are moments in your career when you should be really, really bad. Not intentionally. But if you don't fail or don't fall on your face occasionally then you're not doing your job. You have to dare to go to a place where something might not work.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- I feel like I do stuff in auditions or rehearsals sometimes that makes people go, ''What the hell is she doing?''</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- As a director, the people I respond to in auditions are the ones who walk into the room and have something beyond confidence. It's as if they're saying: ''Here's what I would do with the role. If you like it, that's great, and if not, no shame on me.''  It's frustrating to me when actors try to second guess what I'm looking for because sometimes I don't know. Or I think I'm looking for one thing and then the exact opposite person comes in and shows me something else.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- Do people try to please you? I know I've worked with actors who never want to make a choice that would make their character look mean or unappealing.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- I'm sympathetic to that. When I was doing the first part of ''Angels in America,'' the role always felt safe and good. I felt the audience was able to suspend judgment on the character I was playing -- who did some horrible things. But then going into the play's second part, I could feel a turn. They didn't like him anymore. When I felt that, I think I made a conscious choice to try to soften what he did. And therefore certain scenes weren't working.</p>
        <p>Then the director, George Wolfe, said to me: ''You know, in this particular scene you have to dare to be unlikable. You have to dare to go to the bottom and let him do despicable things and say horrible things. Because the redemption will be greater.''</p>
        <p>PARKER -- Don't you love that though?</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- I thought it was the greatest advice anyone has ever given me. It was liberating.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- For me, I have to find what it is that the character hopes to achieve by doing whatever hateful or heinous thing they're doing. And try to make that thing positive or hopeful, no matter what they're doing.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- Where does the director fit in?</p>
        <p>PARKER -- I've been so lucky, I've had such amazing directors. And certainly Norman Rene directed me differently than Dan Sullivan, or Chris Ashley, or Adrian Noble, or Mark Brokaw. Everyone's been different. And that's great, because every time you do a play you're getting a different education about yourself, about the theater and about you as an actor and about other actors. Dan, for example, is so smart. He could see things in ''Proof'' that I just did not. Sometimes I miss blatant things that I'm embarrassed by later. But when Dan saw so much, it gave me something new to work with. It's hard, though, because I can be really private about my process. I don't want to talk about it and don't want people to talk to me about it. Let's not talk about it now [laughs].</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- What?</p>
        <p>PARKER -- There are some things I feel about a character that are just for me to know and the really brilliant directors won't ask you.</p>
        <p>In every play there is a point -- do you feel this directing? -- where I go, ''I cannot act, I should not be allowed to act.'' I don't know why. Did you have that as an actor?</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- I had it as an actor and I have it as a director. When I feel it as a director, I say it to the room because I think it's deadly if I don't acknowledge it.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- As an actor it's horrifying, isn't it?</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- It's just the worst. Even as a director, you think, ''Well, I'm just going to say it to you all: 'We'll have to go home now because I need to think about this some more because I have absolutely no clue as to what this next section is about.' ''</p>
        <p>PARKER -- I would so respect that. I love it when a director says, ''I don't know.'' Because then we don't have to figure it all out at once.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- But after you've been in a play for a while and you get good at it, isn't it a great feeling to go out there for those two hours when you've smoothed out the wrinkles?</p>
        <p>PARKER -- I never feel that way. Well, do I? I don't know, that's a good question.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- You never felt in ''Prelude to a Kiss'' that you got to a point where there was ease?</p>
        <p>PARKER -- I was so much younger then. I feel like I approach things differently today. I try to go out there as empty as I can.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- What do you mean empty?</p>
        <p>PARKER -- Without too much information from the last night's show or from what I have designs on in the show. There was a time in my life when I used to come offstage and mentally make notes: ''O.K., this went really well. I have to remember this.'' It's good for me not to remember the things that went well.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- It's good to take a shower -- literally and figuratively -- between performances.</p>
        <p>You know, when I was coming here today I walked by that restaurant where Circle Rep used to be----</p>
        <p>PARKER -- Oh, it just kills me every time I go by. I want to start crying. They shouldn't put anything there, just a signpost. Some of the greatest theater in American history came out of that little tiny space that's now serving Buffalo wings. It makes me so sad.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- It's depressing.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- Circle Rep is what theater is to me. Just like the Theatre de Complicite in London and Moises Kaufman's Tectonic Theater Project in New York, which did ''The Laramie Project,'' and the Edge Theater that we started----</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- With Peter Hedges.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- It's people getting together, a group effort, to make that black box or piece of cardboard look like a house. I never really thought of what it would have been like if I hadn't had that.</p>
        <p>What was so amazing about the Edge Theater was that it was a small group and we were so in love with each other's talent. I used to watch you and just die. And Peter, whenever we did anything, Peter would die laughing or burst into tears. So you could not have asked for more support.</p>
        <p>MANTELLO -- It didn't matter if it was good or horrible, because we were still forming who we were or who we were on our way to becoming. That just doesn't happen when you walk out of school with a diploma. And you weren't about to be booted out if you weren't good or if the play wasn't good or if the production wasn't good. There was a sense of a continuum.</p>
        <p>It was the same thing with Circle Rep when I first started directing. Even if I directed something that was not a critical or artistic success, I knew they were committed to me. So while it didn't feel great to fail, I didn't feel that my head was on the chopping block. There was a nurturing that allows you to mature.</p>
        <p>Very few people emerge fully formed as artists. And you're not going to do it by waiting tables or answering telephones. So you've got to have a place to work out. Something beyond acting class. I think it's ideally a place where you're invested in the people and the people are invested in you. And you're in it for the long haul. That's why all those actors who came out of Steppenwolf in Chicago are so extraordinary: it's because they matured individually and as a group, and a way of working came into being because of the collision of all those energies coming together.</p>
        <p>The same was true with Circle Rep. So when the opportunity of ''Prelude to a Kiss,'' working with Craig Lucas and Norman Rene, presents itself, you're not Mary-Louise who has been waiting tables for three years, who is going to get a good break. You have continued to evolve. It's so important. You've just got to make it happen for yourself. You've got to do it.</p>
        <p>PARKER -- What the Edge Theater gave me was time to become strong and secure in my ability to take any chance I wanted. We could do anything. And we got strong at it, we were athletes at it, we grew to love it. That's how we learned how to work, by taking chances. If you learn to trust your instincts -- and if you are supported while you learn -- you become more of yourself; you become distilled into the essence of you, and you become more pure as an artist.</p>
        <p>Whereas if your life is about auditions, it's scary to take chances in a room unless you're used to it. And when you've got a ton of things at stake, it's really scary. But if you're used to it, that's how you work. That's how you create. That's what makes you feel alive.</p>
