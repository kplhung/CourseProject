        <p>The Yankees' dugout felt like a funeral, Derek Jeter exclaimed when he came off the field in the fifth inning last night. Funerals are for the dead, and the Yankees played the part perfectly in Game 4.</p>
        <p>The Yankees could have finished off Oakland and advanced to the next round of the American League playoffs. Instead, Roger Clemens gave up a three-run homer to Olmedo Saenz in the first inning, the Athletics rookie Barry Zito shut down the Yankees' pitiful offense, and Oakland romped, 11-1. The Athletics scored five runs in the last two innings to add to the ugliness of this loss, and by game's end Yankee Stadium fans were derisively cheering each time a Yankee pitcher got an out.</p>
        <p>So the Yankees must now play a fifth game in the three-of-five-game series tonight in Oakland after an overnight flight. The last time the Yankees played a game that decided a series was in the division series in 1997, when they were beaten in Game 5 by the Indians in Cleveland in a game started by Andy Pettitte on three days' rest.</p>
        <p>Pettitte will start Game 5 tonight in Oakland on three days' rest, facing Gil Meche.</p>
        <p>''Sure as heck we don't want to make a 3,000-mile trip and not show up,'' Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>The manager added: ''We're getting on this plane tonight, and we're going out there for a reason. We'll be there and hopefully we'll come back with more work to do.''</p>
        <p>At least Pettitte had the chance for a good night's sleep. Before traveling to any city, the Yankees send their starting pitcher one day ahead of the rest of the team to make sure he does not have to travel overnight. Pettitte did not want to fly yesterday afternoon, with the Yankees on the verge of clinching; he knew there was a chance he could fly all the way across the country and then have to fly back on Sunday if the Yankees won Game 4.</p>
        <p>The Yankees were scheduled to check into their Bay Area hotel early this morning, at about 5 a.m. Maybe they will sleep five or six hours before heading to the ballpark to play Game 5, against an equally tired team -- but the Athletics are younger, and they will be at home.</p>
        <p>''We can't worry about this trip, the late night and all that stuff,'' Scott Brosius said. ''Tomorrow is a dogfight. It's one game and the winner moves on.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees' two-year reign could end tonight. David Cone, Paul O'Neill and Tino Martinez could play their last game with the Yankees, and the principal owner George Steinbrenner could demand major changes if they lose, if Oakland, a team with a $32 million payroll, sinks his $112 million juggernaut.</p>
        <p>If the Yankees win, they will fly back to New York to open the American League Championship Series against Seattle on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Clemens had not pitched on three days' rest in seven years, and the last time he had worked on three days' rest in the postseason was in 1990, when he was ejected in the second inning of a game against Oakland after allowing three runs. Clemens figured that he would know in the first inning whether he had a good fastball -- and he did, it seemed. What he lacked was control.</p>
        <p>Clemens walked the first batter he faced, Terrence Long, on four pitches, glaring repeatedly at Umpire Mike Winters, who called a tight strike zone for both teams. With one out, Clemens appeared to pitch around the slugger Jason Giambi, walking him on five pitches, following the strategy that had worked for the Yankees in this series: avoid Giambi, attack the Nos. 4 and 5 batters who follow. In the first three games of the series, Oakland's cleanup batters combined to go 0 for 11 and had hit into three double plays.</p>
        <p>Athletics Manager Art Howe had tried Ben Grieve, Saenz and Eric Chavez. Tonight, Howe went back to Saenz, who did not start Game 1 against Clemens. The Yankees' right-hander, needing to get ahead in the count, whipped a fastball over the inside half of the strike zone, and Saenz swung.</p>
        <p>Left fielder David Justice barely moved, taking a step back before stopping and watching the ball disappear into the first rows of stands. The crowd murmured like a court gallery stunned by a guilty verdict.</p>
        <p>About the home run, Clemens said, ''That's disappointing, there's no question about it.''</p>
        <p>Saenz's homer buckled the Yankees, who had begun to build some momentum in winning Games 2 and 3 despite minimal offensive production. But before they even batted in Game 4, they were in a three-run hole, facing a talented rookie left-hander, Zito, who had been dominating the rest of the American League with a cut-and-paste lineup that had not produced a home run in nine days.</p>
        <p>The Yankee Stadium crowd kept cajoling the Yankees and trying to bestow their energy on them. A Yankee batter would take a ball to open an at-bat and the fans would clap and cheer, accustomed to the idea that one ball might lead to another, and then a walk and a hit, and maybe someone would hit a homer.</p>
        <p>It didn't happen. Zito, his pant cuffs worn at a height that would satisfy Orlando Hernandez, was throwing strikes and changing speeds, keeping the Yankees' hitters completely off balance. Paul O'Neill took a curveball to strike out in his first at-bat. As he looked for an off-speed pitch in the fourth inning, O'Neill flailed weakly at a high fastball. Justice swung through a fastball; Glenallen Hill was fooled by a fastball.</p>
        <p>Zito was drafted 16 months ago, made his major league debut in July, and three months later he was threatening a dynasty.</p>
        <p>Clemens found his stuff in the third inning, striking out a couple of hitters with runners on base and retiring the Athletics in order in the fourth and fifth innings. The Yankees failed to score in the bottom of the fifth, however, and in the top of the sixth, Clemens faded for good as his pitch count neared 100, allowing three straight hits to open the inning. Oakland scored three runs in the inning to make the outcome inevitable, and in their idle moments in the last three innings, players from both teams probably looked ahead toward the long night of travel, the Game 5 that would be played on only a few hours of sleep.</p>
        <p>''We're obviously not doing it the easy way,'' Clemens said. ''Nothing's been easy for us this year. I don't expect it any different tonight.''</p>
        <p>The truck that would carry the Yankees' equipment to the airport for the cross-country flight was mostly empty this afternoon, even after players arrived at Yankee Stadium. The vast majority of them packed an extra set of clothes, just in case they lost this game, but they had left their garment bags and suitcases in their cars.</p>
        <p>When it was apparent that the Yankees would have to go all the way across the country again, to play a decisive playoff game in front of a hostile crowd with a starting pitcher working on short rest, the bags were retrieved from the parking lot and loaded into the truck.</p>
        <p>The Yankees will bring the bags back with them tonight. The question is whether champions or former champions will carry them.</p>
