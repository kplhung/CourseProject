        <p>I read the article about an advocacy group for fathers' rights [''Shredding the Concept of 'Deadbeat Dads,' '' Long Island Journal, Oct. 1] and recoiled at another approach that reinforces the wedge between divorced parents.

        <p>What divorced parent or second spouse can't flawlessly recite the serious failings of the ex who haunts her life? However, this exercise does little to help our children. I invite the leaders of Women for Fatherhood to redirect their energies and support the many initiatives that are helping families reorganize in a way that's best for their child.</p>
