        <p>THE Rev. Philip J. Cascia already has an autographed baseball from Fidel Castro, a copper plate from Muammar el-Qaddafi, and letters of appreciation from the last three American presidents. But he could find space in his den for one more symbol of recognition.</p>
        <p>While he is not redecorating yet, Father Cascia, a Roman Catholic priest in Prospect, is in the running for another honor: a Nobel Peace Prize for his work with Intersport USA, a group he founded that seeks to advance world peace through exchange programs for high school athletes.</p>
        <p>Father Cascia's work with Intersport all began with a joke. While working on a rewrite of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act in 1987, Father Cascia, 48, joined four senators, including Bob Dole, then the majority leader, for lunch in the Senate dining room.</p>
        <p>Father Cascia says that the conversation somehow turned to religion in the Soviet Union, and he quipped, ''We'd do better bringing my Catholic high school wrestling team to Russia than if we tried to sneak in Bibles.''</p>
        <p>The senators liked the idea, and eight months later, 87 wrestlers from the team that Father Cascia coached at Sacred Heart High School in Waterbury were off to Russia.</p>
        <p>''We were beat bad,'' Father Cascia said. ''It was 'The Bad News Bears' went to Moscow. But it was the camaraderie that was tremendous.''</p>
        <p>Two days after the team's return to Connecticut, Father Cascia got a call from a man who said he was with the White House chief of staff's office, asking him to bring the wrestlers to meet with President Reagan. Confident it was a prank call, Father Cascia slammed the phone down.</p>
        <p>''I got a call three minutes later from Lowell Weicker's chief of staff at the Senate and he said to me, 'You just hung up on the White House chief of staff's secretary. The president wants to see you and the kids in the Oval Office in two days.' ''</p>
        <p>Father Cascia and his wrestlers arrived at the White House for a planned five-minute photo opportunity. President Reagan became so engrossed in the stories of the athletes, however, that the session became a 45-minute dialogue.</p>
        <p>''He threw the press and everybody out of the office because he wanted to talk candidly with the kids,'' Father Cascia said. ''Then he turned to me and said, 'You've got to continue this program.' '' And Father Cascia did.</p>
        <p>Thirteen years and more than 150 trips later, he may be joining the ranks of Mother Teresa, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Henry Kissinger as a Nobel honoree.</p>
        <p>The Nobel Peace Prize, an accolade that would bring Father Cascia fame as well as a check for about $1 million, will be announced on Friday and presented to the winner on Dec. 10 in Norway.</p>
        <p>The person responsible for Father Cascia's nomination is one of Connecticut's congressmen, James H. Maloney, who also honored the priest on the floor of Congress.</p>
        <p>''This is a way of keeping human being to human being relations, even when diplomatic relations are at their most strained levels,'' Mr. Maloney said.</p>
        <p>And these relations, Father Cascia said, often leave lasting impressions on those involved. ''I've had some kids that have had their lives totally affected and they come out different people,'' he said. ''It's the viewpoint that there are people out there that live different than I do, think different than I do, and that's not bad.''</p>
        <p>One such participant was Paul Rogers, a 27-year-old insurance agent from Middlebury. As a 15-year-old sophomore in high school, Mr. Rogers went on the first Intersport trip to Russia. ''It definitely changed my life,'' he said. ''It taught me to appreciate what I have here and take advantage of the opportunities I have.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers went to China, Vietnam and Cuba with the program. ''It was amazing,'' he said. ''These were just places on the globe, but then you realize that they're kids just like us.''</p>
        <p>That attitude was reflected by Al Schoenberg, secretary of Intersport's board of directors.</p>
        <p>''It's opened up my eyes to many different people, places and cultures,'' said Mr. Schoenberg, who has been to Vietnam, the Dominican Republic and Cuba with the group, as a referee. ''This has pretty much changed my life and my wife's life. People are people, and this is a people-to-people thing.''</p>
        <p>And that realization, Father Cascia said, is what helps to bring peace.</p>
        <p>''Our program is trying to build the bridges of understanding by getting the kids together,'' he said. ''And when you get the kids together, then it helps the adults talk a little bit better.</p>
        <p>Intersport became the first United States sports delegation ever to visit Vietnam, and the first to visit South Africa since apartheid.</p>
        <p>The organization was the first nonprofit organization to get its permanent travel license to Cuba, and was responsible for the first appearance by a Cuban ambassador for a non-United Nations function outside the U.N.-free travel zone in New York. The group was responsible for the first raising of the American flag by the Vietnamese government since before the war there. And Father Cascia became the first American to receive a Diploma of Appreciation from the Soviet Union, an honor normally reserved for Soviet citizens.</p>
        <p>Now the group is trying to develop relationships with North Korea, Iran, Libya, Brazil and Peru.</p>
        <p>All in all, Father Cascia thinks it's been an impressive 13 years for his group, which has one paid employee.</p>
        <p>''We're a Mom and Pop organization,'' he said. ''We're not a major conglomerate nonprofit organization.''</p>
        <p>Father Cascia, who is pastor of St. Anthony's Church in Prospect, a town of 8,000 not far from Waterbury and Naugatuck, said he has the full backing of the State Department for his efforts. The parish priest, who meets with foreign ambassadors regularly in his pursuit of peace, also seems to be held in high regard by heads of state. In 1989, at a meeting between Mikhail Gorbachev and Pope John Paul II, Father Cascia was invited to the papal chambers to witness the event.</p>
        <p>When the United Nations was celebrating its 50th anniversary in 1995, Fidel Castro held a party for 200 heads of state and other notables at the Cuban Mission in New York. Father Cascia was one of the invited guests, and says several countries sought his ticket for their leaders.</p>
        <p>These affiliations with foreign leaders help Father Cascia expand Intersport's reach.</p>
        <p>The priest says interest grows yearly, with the group currently sponsoring about nine trips abroad each year, and playing host to another three groups in the United States. The trips are paid for through corporate and private sponsors as well as contributions from participants.</p>
        <p>''Father Cascia has bridged the gap and used the people of the future to understand,'' said Chris Georgiou, who coordinates Intersport's South African relations from his Johannesburg home. ''Sports, in a way, are an excuse to get them to learn their culture and their ways.''</p>
        <p>Father Cascia says he couldn't agree more. ''Personal interaction, even on the competitive level, actually lends itself to interaction on the off-the-field level,'' he said. ''In Communist countries, when they threw God out they replaced it by making sports the religion of the people. If you're going to speak to the heart of the people, you've got to do it through sports.''</p>
        <p>''Sports,'' he said, ''has been an international language of good will.''</p>
