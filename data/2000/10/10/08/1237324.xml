        <p>It is true that making personal judgments about how to respond to the Boy Scouts' ban on gays will be painful and even divisive for many parents and children in their own communities, but your article does not mention the most distressing aspect of all.</p>

        <p>Re ''Scouting Debate Leaves Children Caught in Middle'' (news article, Oct. 1):</p>
        <p>It is true that making personal judgments about how to respond to the Boy Scouts' ban on gays will be painful and even divisive for many parents and children in their own communities, but your article does not mention the most distressing aspect of all.</p>
        <p>Some percentage of the 9-year-old boys currently taking part in the Boy Scouts will grow up to be homosexual, although they may not yet be aware of it. What will become of those who dream of being Eagle Scouts, when their sexuality becomes evident to them?</p>
        <p>If they are forthright as their oath demands, they will be required to disqualify themselves. How will that make them feel about themselves and about the Boy Scouts?</p>
