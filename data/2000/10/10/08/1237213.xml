        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It was with great relish that I read ''A Chewy Relic of the Old World'' (Sept. 10) Mimi Sheraton's Soapbox essay on Kossar's Bakery.</p>
        <p>I grew up on Grand Street and have been eating Bialystoker kuchen for over half a century. They were the mainstays of my family's after-Sabbath light supper. From the time I was 10, it was my job to buy the three-for-a-dime kuchen along with a quarter-pound of cream cheese. Perfectly balanced with crispness and oniony flavor, they smelled almost as good as they tasted.</p>

        <p>I grew up on Grand Street and have been eating Bialystoker kuchen for over half a century. They were the mainstays of my family's after-Sabbath light supper. From the time I was 10, it was my job to buy the three-for-a-dime kuchen along with a quarter-pound of cream cheese. Perfectly balanced with crispness and oniony flavor, they smelled almost as good as they tasted.</p>
        <p>Although I've moved away from Grand Street, Kossar's remained one of my regular food shopping stops. That is until the bakery changed hands. I'm not sure whether it has to do with the younger generation's alleged demand for pale, flabby and listless creations. I'm with Ms. Sheraton in preferring the original crispness and tastier flavor, but whoever assured her there's enough of both types was wrong. I'm lucky if I get one or two of the good kind in a dozen.</p>
