        <p>Re Joyce Purnick's Oct. 5 Metro Matters column, ''Rethinking Police Dept. Recruitment'': Reducing the college requirement for New York City police recruits is the wrong direction for the department.</p>
        <p>According to my office's analysis, better-educated officers have fewer civilian complaints, higher performance ratings and are more racially and ethnically tolerant. Last year, officers with no college education made up 71 percent of the force, but accounted for 81 percent of civilian complaints. Officers with a full college degree made up 17 percent of the department, but only 11 percent of complaints.</p>

        <p>All recruits should have their college degrees or get them within three years (if they enter the force with two years of college credit). Officers completing their degrees on the job should get tuition assistance.</p>
        <p>Much of the millions of dollars that have gone toward an unsuccessful recruitment campaign would have been better spent on building a better educated and more effective police force.</p>
