        <p>The King's Gambit has been out of favor for a long time. In the 1858 match for world supremacy between Adolph Anderssen and Paul Morphy in Paris, it did not appear. But in their offhand games afterward it was played in each one of the six encounters. It was evident that the players enjoyed using it but did not trust it to a formal challenge.</p>
        <p>And things went steadily downhill. In the 1930's, the great champion of the gambit, Rudolph Spielmann, wrote an article titled, ''From the Sickbed of the King's Gambit.'' His desk, manuscript and pen were surely bathed in tears.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, a small sprinkling of nostalgic souls continue to venture this brave but unreliable sortie. But vengeful antagonists are just waiting to shoot them down. The Belarus grandmaster Alexei Fedorov keeps trying, but he walked into an ambush against the Spanish grandmaster Alexei Shirov in the Akiba Rubinstein Memorial Tournament, Aug. 17-26, in Polanica Zdroj, Poland.</p>
        <p>Anyone unfamiliar with the King's Gambit should decline it with 2 . . . Bc5. For example, 3 Nf3 d6 4 Nc3 Nf6 5 Bc4 Nc6 6 d3 Bg4 7 h3 Bf3 8 Qf3 ef 9 Bf4 Nd4 10 Qd1 c6 11 Na4 may yield White a slight superiority, but Black has escaped heavy complications and has reasonable play. For a long time now, aggressive connoisseurs of this opening accept it with 2 . . . ef when they are out to refute it.</p>
        <p>After 3 Nf3, Black has a chance to play for equality with 3 . . . d5 4 ed Nf6, but Shirov is out for more. The threat in 3 . . . g5 is to maintain Black's extra pawn.</p>
        <p>For a long time, White's favorite line has been the Kieseritsky Gambit with 4 h4. Its positional purpose is to ruin the black kingside pawn structure and collect the sacrificed pawn later with a winning game.</p>
        <p>After 6 . . . Nf6, White has tried 7 Nf6 Qf6 8 Nc3 Be6 9 Qe2 Nd7 10 b3, yet on Rg8 11 Bb2 Bg4 12 Qf2 d5 13 Be2 Bc5 14 Qf1 de 15 O-O-O Bd4 16 Bg4 Rg4 17 Re1 O-O-O 18 Re4 Nc5 19 Re1, Black's mobility is superior.</p>
        <p>After 8 d4, establishing center control for White, Black must protect the f4 pawn with 8 . . . Bh6, not just to stay even in material, but to keep the white queen bishop from entering the game.</p>
        <p>Through 11 ed, this game followed Fedorov-S. Pedersen in Ars last year, but Shirov's 11 . . . Qe7! was a powerful improvement over 11 . . . Ne7, which Pedersen had played.</p>
        <p>The key move, which came up after 12 Be2 Nb4! 13 c4 was Shirov's 13 . . . Bf5! If Fedorov had taken his king out of the center with 14 O-O, he would have been hit by 14 . . . Qh4! 15 Qa4 Ke7 16 Bf3 Nc2 17 Bd2 Nd4! 18 Qd1 Rg3 19 Nh1 Rag8, when there is no way to defend the white king.</p>
        <p>So, Fedorov braced himself for the worst, took the offered knight with 14 Qa4 Kf8 15 Qb4, and tried to face down the attack. He could not.</p>
        <p>With 17 . . . Rg3! Shirov threatened 18 . . . Re3. So, Fedorov tried 18 Qd1, but after 18 . . . Be4, he could not reduce material with 19 Ne4 Qe4 because of 20 Rh2 (20 Rg1 Qe2 21 Qe2 Rg1 22 Kg1 Re2 yields Shirov a winning endgame) Bg7 21 Bf4 Qf4 22 Rf2 Bd4! 23 Rf4 Rg1mate.</p>
        <p>After 21 . . . e3, there was no relief by 22 Rg2 Qh4 23 Rg3 Qg3 24 Qf3 e2.</p>
        <p>After 23 Rh1, Shirov ended all resistance with 23 . . . Rg2! If 24 Bg2, there would come 24 . . . e2 25 Qe2 Re2 26 Ke2 Qg2. Fedorov gave up.</p>
        <p>The world championship match between Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik begins today in London. The match will go a maximum of 16 games and will be won by the first player to amass 8 1/2 points, with Kasparov retaining the title in the event of an 8-8 tie. The Times will publish articles on the match games, beginning tomorrow. The chess column will be suspended for the duration of the match and will resume in November.</p>
