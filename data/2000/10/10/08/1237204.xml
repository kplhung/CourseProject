        <p>Tre Johnson, the Peekskill native who is a lineman with the Washington Redskins, started his season late and it appears to have ended early. The 6-foot-2, 326-pound guard, who served an opening-game suspension for striking an official last season, suffered a torn left-knee ligament in last Sunday's victory over Tampa Bay. Coach Norv Turner said he expected Johnson to need surgery and be lost for the season. ''It's what you have to live with,'' Johnson said early in the week. ''All I can do is what I can do.''</p>
