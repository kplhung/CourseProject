        <p>LITTLE wonder that Lucinda Childs is fluent in French these days.

        <p>The explanation is simple enough. European governments have always spent generously on the arts, with France showing particular interest in contemporary American dance.

        <p>LITTLE wonder that Lucinda Childs is fluent in French these days. Her choreography may be quintessentially American, a product of her early training with Merce Cunningham, her years at the Judson Dance Theater and her long association with Robert Wilson, Philip Glass and John Adams. But when it comes to pursuing her career, this tall, striking New Yorker leaves her SoHo loft and invariably heads for Europe, usually France.</p>
        <p>The explanation is simple enough. European governments have always spent generously on the arts, with France showing particular interest in contemporary American dance. And when choreographers like Mr. Cunningham, Trisha Brown and Ms. Childs were struggling to find backers in the United States in the early 1980's, France stepped in to rescue them. Today, Ms. Childs is revered across Europe as a grande dame of American dance. In the United States, though, her work is so rarely seen that she has assumed almost mythical status.</p>
        <p>This week, the Lucinda Childs Dance Company is appearing in New York for only the second time in 11 years. Having spent the summer performing across Europe, Ms. Childs and her 12 dancers are presenting ''Parcours'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater for four performances starting on Wednesday. The 75-minute program, without intermission, comprises four United States premieres along with ''Radial Courses'' (1976), performed in silence, and ''Concerto'' (1993), with music by Henryk Gorecki, which was seen at the Joyce Theater in 1994 during the company's previous New York season.</p>
        <p>Ms. Childs has included ''Radial Courses'' as an echo of her most minimalist New York period, when her choreography was stripped of all artifices -- not only music, but even recognizable dance movements -- and  reduced almost to the act of walking. On the other hand, she is also eager to show how her work with modern composers has led her choreography to ever more complex geometric patterns, marked as always by skips, jumps, turns and sudden changes of direction.</p>
        <p>The new pieces in the Brooklyn program are ''Commencement'' (1995), a four-minute solo by Ms. Childs with music by the Polish composer Zygmunt Krauze; ''From the White Edge of Phrygia'' (1995), a full company 23-minute work with music by the American Stephen Montague; ''Sunrise of the Planetary Dream Collector'' (1998), set to music by the minimalist American composer Terry Riley; and ''Variete de Variete'' (2000), with music by Mauricio Kagel of Argentina.</p>
        <p>Yet even this occasion illustrates the fragility of Ms. Childs's dance company. Because of difficulty in raising money for just four performances at the Academy, the troupe's 25th anniversary season is taking place 27 years after its first appearance, at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Further, the company has always been an on-again, off-again affair: it never worked for more than 30 weeks a year; it was disbanded in 1995 and reconstituted only in February of this year; and on Sunday, after its tour ends in New York, it will be dissolved again.</p>
        <p>''I don't regret a minute of all this hard work of putting the company back together,'' Ms. Childs said, ''but I don't see myself jumping back into this situation immediately until I feel that things in the United States are moving along in a slightly better direction.''</p>
        <p>Still, at 60 and in good health (although she recently broke her right arm in a fall), Ms. Childs remains much in demand in Europe as a guest choreographer. Last month, while her company took a break after performing in eight European cities, she began creating a new work, ''The Chairman Dances,'' to music by Mr. Adams, for Les Ballets de Monte Carlo. After this 12 1/2-minute piece has its premiere in December, accompanied by a reprise of ''Concerto,'' Ms. Childs will travel to Munich to create a new work for the Bayerisches Staatsballet and start preparing choreography -- probably for Gluck's ''Orfeo et Euridice'' -- at the Scottish Opera.</p>
        <p>''I have always loved to do other things,'' she said in an interview between rehearsals at the Monte Carlo ballet's headquarters in Beausoleil, just across Monaco's border with France. ''I would never try to make a company work all year. You can't do this week after week after week.''</p>
        <p>''Other things'' have come easily in Europe. Over the past 20 years, she has created works for dance companies in Paris, Lyon, Berlin, Munich, Monte Carlo, Charleroi (Belgium) and even New York (for the Martha Graham Company in 1997 and 1999). Having worked on the Glass-Wilson opera ''Einstein on the Beach'' in 1976 and again on its 1984 and 1992 revivals, she also moved into mainstream opera. Since doing the choreography for the ''Dance of the Seven Veils'' in Luc Bondy's production of ''Salome'' in 1992, she has worked on five other operas, including Mozart's ''Zaide,'' the first she has directed. And most recently, she has spent two years as an actress, touring Europe alongside Michel Piccoli in Mr. Wilson's French-language production of Marguerite Duras's play ''La Maladie de la Mort.''</p>
        <p>MS. CHILDS'S curiosity is evidently innate. Even at the start of her career, she sought new challenges. While studying at Sarah Lawrence College, she began taking classes with Mr. Cunningham. After graduating in 1962, she continued to take lessons at the Cunningham studio, but she also participated in performances of the Judson Dance Theater, the experimental collective founded by Yvonne Rainer and Steve Paxton, among others.</p>
        <p>''I felt completely torn in different directions,'' she recalled. ''I never gave up the classical training, but I also committed myself totally to the Judson experience, working outside the dance vocabulary with objects and texts and anything but dance steps. In the morning, you'd go to ballet class and in the afternoon you'd carry mattresses and that kind of thing.''</p>
        <p>But in 1968, after creating a dozen experimental pieces at the Judson, Ms. Childs tired of begging dancers to work for her without pay and became a first-grade teacher in a New York public school. The escape lasted five years, long enough for the financial climate for culture to improve. And when she returned to the world of dance, a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts led to the formation of the Lucinda Childs Dance Company and its first appearance at the Whitney Museum. A new adventure was about to begin.</p>
        <p>''I enjoyed all the experimentation at the Judson, but at a certain point, I wondered, 'Supposing one were to let go of the objects and the texts and the whatnots, what would be left?' '' she said. ''I enjoyed just dealing with the very simple movements that would be considered perhaps pedestrian: walking, changing directions. After Pop Art, which seemed like the end of everything, the minimalist movement was just the opposite. Everything was beginning, everything could be reduced to the seemingly simple.''</p>
        <p>By the mid 70's, though, having successfully deconstructed movement in space (and often in silence), Ms. Childs was ready to test herself afresh by working with artists from other mediums, starting with ''Einstein'' in 1976 and continuing in 1979 with her acclaimed ''Dance,'' with music by Mr. Glass and film and decor by the artist Sol LeWitt. Four years later, she created ''Available Light,'' with music by Mr. Adams and a split-level set by the architect Frank Gehry. Anna Kisselgoff, writing in The New York Times, described the piece as ''not only a major breakthrough in Ms. Childs's career, but a major work altogether.''</p>
        <p>Even as she has branched out in the 1990's to work with non-American composers and independent dance companies, however, the stylized austerity of her work never wavered. Critics often call it cerebral and intellectual because it makes no overt concessions to emotion or romance and certainly none to narrative: her dancers never touch or look at one another, never project their individuality onto the audience.</p>
        <p>THERE is emotion,'' Ms. Childs insisted, ''but I don't dictate which one.'' As for her own severe presence on stage, she added: ''No one is saying you have to see me this way or that way. I'm just there. Take it or leave it, or think what you want.''</p>
        <p>And yet, rebellion is again in the air. And while it may not be apparent to Academy audiences, Ms. Childs has suddenly reached a ''why not?'' stage in her life. In ''Description (of a Description),'' a solo created in Montpelier this June, she returned to working with a text, by Susan Sontag. Even more unexpectedly, in the piece she is creating for Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, two dancers do indeed touch each other in what she jokingly calls her ''Not Me Pas de Deux.'' And for the work she is preparing for Munich next year, she plans both to use dancers on point and to include music by a classical composer -- Bach -- for the first time.</p>
        <p>''Why not?'' she asked. ''I feel at this stage I have the privilege of exploring areas where conceivably people feel that I don't belong.''</p>
        <p>Yet it never ceases to frustrate her that she can do this in Europe, not in the United States.</p>
        <p>''I have always wanted to go back to New York, where the dancers are, where they train, where I have always worked,'' Ms. Childs said. ''Hopefully things will turn round in the United States, but the signs are not good. Of course, it's wonderful that we're invited back here all the time, but I feel that European support is out of balance, and it's wrong.''</p>
        <p>That said, after the Brooklyn Academy's season is over, she will rest up at home for a few weeks, then return to work. In Europe, of course.</p>
