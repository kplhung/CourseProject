        <p>MISGIVINGS</p>
        <p>My Mother, My Father, Myself.</p>
        <p>By C. K. Williams.</p>
        <p>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $21.</p>
        <p>The poet and translator C. K. Williams uses the long, Whitmanesque verse line to expose in often excruciating detail intense passions and private anxieties. An acute observer of the public world as well as the private world, Williams meticulously documents the seemingly ordinary moments lived by seemingly ordinary people, brilliantly implicating himself in the confusion of their lives. In ''Misgivings,'' Williams's prose meditation on his dead parents, the skillful voyeur is still hard at work -- I watch them both, my mother and father, I watch myself watching'' -- but the poet, sadly, has receded into the background. Williams's father was a hard man of imposing height who deliberately hurt his son but who also instilled in him a love of poetry and Greek myths. His mother emerges as a perpetually uneasy woman who was ''completely and unquestioningly self-centered,'' disapproving of her son's profession as a poet even well into his adult life. The book's linked series of short vignettes succeed in bringing the parents into focus but they provide few signs of the poetic sensibility that produced the powerful elegies from ''The Vigil'' (1997) or a poem like ''Invisible Mending'' from the Pulitzer Prize-winning collection, ''Repair'' (1999). Williams's struggle to come to terms with his ambivalence about the necessarily imperfect parents with whom he believes he is forever ''fused in a cosmic entanglement'' yields neither great poetry nor particularly compelling reading. Rather, it simply provokes a plaintive son into setting his misgivings about his parents down on paper.</p>
