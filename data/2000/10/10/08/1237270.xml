        <p>On the eve of the first of three televised debates, the race to succeed United States Senator Frank R. Lautenberg is coming down to a stark question: Will the Republican candidate, Bob Franks, have enough money to run a credible race against his Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine?</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, is expected to spend more than $60 million. Mr. Franks keeps lowering his spending target and now says he hopes to spend $4 million. No recent Senate candidate from New Jersey, win or lose, has spent less than $7 million.</p>

        <p>On the eve of the first of three televised debates, the race to succeed United States Senator Frank R. Lautenberg is coming down to a stark question: Will the Republican candidate, Bob Franks, have enough money to run a credible race against his Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine?</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, is expected to spend more than $60 million. Mr. Franks keeps lowering his spending target and now says he hopes to spend $4 million. No recent Senate candidate from New Jersey, win or lose, has spent less than $7 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks's pleas for money have been turned down so far by both the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Republican Leadership Council.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks's campaign officials readily acknowledge that they wish they had more money, but they say voters are offended by Mr. Corzine's lavish spending. And they insist that that perception, combined with their own campaign's all-or-nothing barrage of television ads in the last two weeks before the Nov. 7 election, will do the trick.</p>
        <p>''You're dead right, in an ordinary race there is no way $4 million is going to do this,'' David A. Norcross, one of the state's two Republican National Committee members and a Franks ally, said in an interview.  ''But Corzine can't win unless he continues to be Goliath, and as long as he's Goliath, we've got a shot to be David.''</p>
        <p>But with polls showing double-digit leads for Mr. Corzine, other Republican strategists say it looks as though the national party has already tossed Mr. Franks overboard in a state that the Republican presidential candidate, George W. Bush, has all but conceded to Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Franks's first hurdle, and one reason that the debate is so important to him, is that few voters know him well. In last week's poll by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, 55 percent of likely New Jersey voters said they did not yet know enough about Mr. Franks to have an opinion of him.</p>
        <p>Lack of visibility has compounded Mr. Franks's problem with the national Republican leadership.</p>
        <p>Federal election laws allow the National Republican Senatorial Committee to give as much as $841,000 to Mr. Franks. So far, it has given nothing, despite Mr. Franks's pleas for some support. Its leaders are giving to Republican candidates in other states who they presumably think have a better chance of winning.</p>
        <p>Even the Republican Leadership Council, a moderate Republican political action committee created by New Jersey's governor, Christine Todd Whitman, has so far declined to help, although its spokesman said it would eventually contribute some television ad time to Mr. Franks.</p>
        <p>''We're not exactly sure what we're going to do or when we're going to do it,'' said the spokesman, Mark Miller, ''although we're aware that 30 days is not a lot of time.''</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Franks has had to contend with the giant sucking sound of all the other Republican candidates nationwide with bigger races and greater stature than he, each of whom are pulling money out of New Jersey, traditionally a gold mine for out-of-state candidates.</p>
        <p>''I think there's a feeling on the national level that if you raise two million for Franks, Corzine will spend four, that no amount of money will level the playing field,'' a leading State House Republican said on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>''What Bob needs to do is tell the national people that he needs money to get his message out.''</p>
        <p>As Chuck Haytaian, the New Jersey Republican Party chairman, put it, ''I think they look at Corzine with his A.T.M. machine and they're not willing to take him on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks is also a comparative latecomer to the business of political fund-raising in New Jersey this year, having had to wait until after he won the primary in June to focus on the general election. By then, Governor Whitman had already raised several million for the same Senate race, which she contemplated, but decided against.</p>
        <p>Then the Republican presidential primaries and campaign drew more Republican money contributions from New Jersey donors.</p>
        <p>''You have Christie's campaign for the Senate, that's $2.25 million,'' Mr. Haytaian said. ''George Bush got over $3 million; John McCain, a million; the Senate candidates in the primary, close to $6 million or more; a million each for the Congressional candidates.</p>
        <p>''It comes out to close to $17 million already.''</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the high-profile contest for United States Senate in New York is being felt in New Jersey, with Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican running against Hillary Rodham Clinton, having raised nearly a million in New Jersey so far.</p>
        <p>Candace Straight, a banker who heads Mr. Franks's fund-raising effort, insisted that although the candidate had made a slow start, things were picking up.</p>
        <p>''If people are telling you that we're only going to raise three or four million from June 30 forward, I sort of agree with them,'' Ms. Straight said, ''and my job is to beat that.</p>
        <p>''Am I going to raise $10 million in the next 30 days? No. But we're working hard and we've got some good events planned and people are starting to call us and money is starting to come in, so I feel good.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks has commuted back and forth from Washington almost daily for the last month, attending to Congressional business in the waning days of the current session and small fund-raisers at home each night.</p>
        <p>Ms. Straight alluded to the crowded field this election season when she explained why Mr. Franks's fund-raising was so low key.</p>
        <p>''Everybody says, 'Why aren't you having these big fancy events?' '' she said. ''We're not doing that because everybody is so busy doing lots of different things that it's much easier to go to people's offices or to their homes.''</p>
        <p>But small affairs raise small sums. Ms. Straight said Mr. Franks's five-a-week events were considered a success if they raised $20,000 each.</p>
        <p>While ads for Mr. Corzine have blanketed radio and television stations in New York and Philadelphia, the Franks campaign has spent just $250,000, on a single commercial being broadcast from Philadelphia to viewers in southern New Jersey. Instead of promoting the candidate, the commercial attacks Mr. Corzine for spending so much on his own campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, by contrast, has produced several commercials attacking Mr. Franks's voting record in Congress. Indeed, Franks campaigners acknowledge that Mr. Corzine has put the Republican's face on television far more extensively than the Franks campaign has been able to. Mr. Norcross, the national committee member, insisted that this was not all bad news.</p>
        <p>''He's given us $5 million worth of exposure on his own,'' he said.</p>
        <p>With Election Day just a month away, Mr. Franks's supporters are making an extra push to persuade the National Republican Senatorial Committee to make its contribution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks said he had spoken to the committee's chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, three times, and Mr. Norcross and Mr. Haytaian have also made their pleas. All said they expected Mr. Franks to get some help.</p>
        <p>Stuart Roy, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said his group gave priority to Republican incumbents seeking re-election, although he said the committee had also spent heavily on nonincumbents in Virginia, Nebraska and other states.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Roy did not foreclose on the possibility of sending help to Mr. Franks in the next four weeks.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Straight said, with her characteristic confidence, that Mr. Franks would prevail. ''With or without Mitch,'' she said, ''I believe we're going to win.''</p>
