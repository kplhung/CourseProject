        <p>Q: A little more than two years ago, my wife and I bought two ground-floor co-op apartments and joined them together. We rented one parking space in the basement garage because the president of the co-op told us we could park our second car in front of a driveway adjacent to our terrace. (The driveway was chained off by the superintendent to prevent other cars from using it.) Some months later, we were advised that other residents would be allowed to park their cars in the driveway for up to 20 minutes -- when we weren't parked there -- to unload groceries from their cars. Now we are being told that we can only park our car in the driveway for 20 minutes to unload groceries. Does the co-op have the right to withdraw our parking privilege after two years? . . . Sidney G. Adler, Lawrence, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A: Andrew P. Brucker, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that it appears from the letter writer's description of the situation that the co-op has permitted the use of the second parking spot merely as an accommodation to the shareholder. And if that is the case, he said, the co-op would have the right to withdraw the accommodation.</p>

        <p>Q: A little more than two years ago, my wife and I bought two ground-floor co-op apartments and joined them together. We rented one parking space in the basement garage because the president of the co-op told us we could park our second car in front of a driveway adjacent to our terrace. (The driveway was chained off by the superintendent to prevent other cars from using it.) Some months later, we were advised that other residents would be allowed to park their cars in the driveway for up to 20 minutes -- when we weren't parked there -- to unload groceries from their cars. Now we are being told that we can only park our car in the driveway for 20 minutes to unload groceries. Does the co-op have the right to withdraw our parking privilege after two years? . . . Sidney G. Adler, Lawrence, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A: Andrew P. Brucker, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that it appears from the letter writer's description of the situation that the co-op has permitted the use of the second parking spot merely as an accommodation to the shareholder. And if that is the case, he said, the co-op would have the right to withdraw the accommodation.</p>
        <p>''While there are some cooperatives in which a parking space is actually included in the proprietary lease and allocated shares, that is fairly rare and does not seem to be the case in this situation,'' Mr. Brucker said, explaining that the letter writer seems to indicate that his use of the spot was contingent upon the board's continuing permission for him to do so.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Brucker said, the use of a parking space in a co-op's garage or other common area is almost always considered to be a privilege rather than a right. Moreover, he said, the business-judgment rule allows a co-op board to exercise extensive powers -- including the granting or restricting of the right to use common areas -- provided that the board is acting in good faith.</p>
        <p>''In this case, the board is terminating the letter writer's parking privilege in order to accommodate the other shareholders in the building,'' he said. ''So there is little doubt in my mind that the parking privilege can be taken away by the board.''</p>
        <p>Installing New Pipes In a Co-op</p>
        <p>Q: Our co-op board is considering repiping the domestic water supply system for our 77-unit, 17-story building. There are five vertical lines of apartments, none with the plumbing back to back. To minimize the construction period, the plan is to leave the existing piping in the walls and add new pipes outside the walls and then box them in. This will result in one vertical line losing space within the bathroom and the others having new pipes run in hallways. Is this the standard way to repipe a building?  . . . Corinne Coleman, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A: Peter Varsalona, a professional engineer with Rand Engineering in Manhattan, said that while there is no standard way of repiping an existing building, it is not uncommon to leave the existing piping inside the walls and install a new system outside the walls.</p>
        <p>''There are several reasons for this,'' Mr. Varsalona said, explaining that installing a new system parallel to the existing one eliminates the necessity for breaking up walls inside hallways and apartments, avoids the problems that can occur when decades-old pipes are disturbed, and minimizes the amount of time the residents will be without water.</p>
        <p>Mr. Varsalona added that while it is sometimes necessary to use some of the living space in an apartment to box out the new pipes, the amount needed is usually minimal.</p>
        <p>''In many cases, you don't really have any other options available,'' he said.</p>
