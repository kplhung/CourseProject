        <p>MAYBE they should check down the rabbit hole.</p>
        <p>The Tarrytown Police Department got a report of 14 large chess pieces stolen Sept. 27 from the rear courtyard of the Castle at Tarrytown, a 31-room luxury hotel and restaurant.</p>
        <p>A castle surveillance camera, which filmed the theft, shows a group of several young people around age 20 carrying piece after piece -- knights, rooks, bishops and pawns, and a gray king -- into the woods near the castle, Detective Sgt. Eugene Buonanno of the Tarrytown police said.</p>
        <p>The thieves carried flashlights and their gestures suggested that they spent time debating which pieces to take, Steffi Walder, co-owner of the Castle, said.</p>
        <p>The full set of pieces, three to four feet tall and made of a lightweight synthetic material, is valued at $10,000, she said, and the stolen ones are valued at $6,260.</p>
        <p>The Castle bought the pieces and installed a giant concrete chess board in 1997 as an eye-catcher and to give a regal feel to the courtyard, Ms. Walder said.</p>
        <p>Hotel staff members learned of the theft when ''guests came in and said, 'Where are the other pieces?' '' she said. ''They couldn't play.''</p>
        <p>''It's either some sort of prank or they're going to copy them,'' Ms. Walder said, adding that the craftsman who created the set told her that a set he had made for a customer in Greenwich Village was also stolen recently.</p>
        <p>The Castle has no moat, she said, and security guards on duty that night saw nothing.</p>
        <p>Detective Buonanno said that detectives are having the videotape cleaned up to identify the chess thieves. ''We've never had a theft quite like this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It probably was not for the monetary value, but maybe to give out to friends as gifts,'' he said. ''People may see them turn up in someone's house, but for now we gotta go to the videotape.''</p>
