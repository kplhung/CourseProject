        <p>Editorial on Airbus Industrie's $11-billion project that would revolutionize long-distance travel with huge triple-decker airplane resembling cruise ship</p>

        <p>Rapid innovation has not been a hallmark of commercial aviation in recent decades. But the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus Industrie is now seeking to revolutionize long-distance travel by developing a huge new triple-decker airplane that would resemble a cruise ship.</p>
        <p>The $11 billion project, labeled the A3XX at this point, poses a serious threat to Boeing, America's top exporter. To the extent that the project is financed by government loans, it could also set off a major trans-Atlantic trade spat. Washington considers such loans inappropriate subsidies. European governments say they offset American manufacturers' Pentagon contracts.</p>

        <p>Rapid innovation has not been a hallmark of commercial aviation in recent decades. But the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus Industrie is now seeking to revolutionize long-distance travel by developing a huge new triple-decker airplane that would resemble a cruise ship.</p>
        <p>The $11 billion project, labeled the A3XX at this point, poses a serious threat to Boeing, America's top exporter. To the extent that the project is financed by government loans, it could also set off a major trans-Atlantic trade spat. Washington considers such loans inappropriate subsidies. European governments say they offset American manufacturers' Pentagon contracts.</p>
        <p>The A3XX, as envisioned by Airbus, would seat up to 650 passengers on two decks and devote a third windowless deck to amenities like a gym, duty-free shops, a casino and bars. Last week Singapore Airlines, one of the world's most respected airlines, ordered 10 of the superjumbo jets and acquired an option on 15 more in an $8.6 billion deal. Airbus has until the end of the year to decide whether it has enough orders on hand to make the project feasible. Meanwhile, Boeing is considering a stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet.</p>
        <p>Passengers should be skeptical of claims that more space on board will translate into more amenities. Early advertisements for the 747, which was introduced in 1969, depicted business travelers flying in offices, families in staterooms and singles swirling martinis in bars. It was all very Austin Powers. Some airlines did experiment with cocktail lounges for a time, but now most cram as many as 420 seats on board, to the exclusion of all else.</p>
        <p>Similarly, while Airbus now pitches shops and gyms, it may not take airlines long to reckon that seating passengers on the third deck could bring the A3XX's capacity to more than 800. One can only hope that the carriers find new ways of herding passengers on and off.</p>
