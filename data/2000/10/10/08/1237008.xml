        <p>LAST Sunday morning in a boxing gym here, a teenage girl was getting slapped around by an older boy. As they circled each other in the ring, she suddenly reared back and unleashed a flurry of punches and kicks.</p>
        <p>''Lay'em in harder,'' boomed a large man at ringside. ''Don't worry about the pain.''</p>
        <p>She did, and he stumbled back into the turnbuckle. With a running start from across the ring, she charged into him, and he slumped down onto the canvas and writhed with mock convulsions. Some of wrestlers at ringside moaned in sympathy and then chanted in a see-saw rhythm: ''He-is-para-lyzed.''</p>
        <p>Actually, he wasn't, which is the point of the Sunday morning wrestling program at the Boxing Connection on Nepperhan Avenue here. The school has a core group of about 25 students who put on monthly shows at the gym.</p>
        <p>The girl, Kelly Webster, 14, from Mount Vernon, joined after serving as a practice dummy for her brother Sandy, 16, who is also a student here. If she was going to be pile-driven daily, she might as well learn how to give it back, she said.</p>
        <p>Now her ring name is Destiny. ''I've always been a big wrestling fan, and it was my dream to get in the ring,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Dino Rosado, a former professional wrestler from Yonkers, started the school in 1997. He said that many young fans try to learn wrestling by watching professional shows and then re-creating the matches and moves in their backyards.</p>
        <p>''It's very dangerous,'' he said, ''so we want to get them out of the backyards and into the ring, so they can train correctly and not get hurt.''</p>
        <p>In the ring, Mr. Rosado's son Justin, 14, was pounding his opponent. Justin, whose ring name is J. B. Crazzee, has been watching wrestling since infancy. When he was 2 and Mr. Rosado was lying on the floor watching wrestling, Justin leapt off the top bunk and body-slammed his father in the belly and ran away.</p>
        <p>''That's when I knew he was going to be a wrestler,'' Mr. Rosado said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in the ring, two very large guys circled each other and collided in the center. Each had a partner with a bean-pole build, who flitted around the outside of the ropes, cheering and heckling.</p>
        <p>The big guys, Bill LeBrando from Yorktown and Vinny Massaro from North White Plains, are college students who came to the school in July and still do not have ring names. They began wrestling in backyards, jumping off ladders and chairs onto each other and videotaping it.</p>
        <p>Later, as heavy metal music blared over a sound system, James Davy, 16, played air guitar, his hair dangling over his face. Known in the ring as Crazy Jim Davy, he said he joined the program three years ago after wrestling ''everywhere and anywhere,'' from living rooms to high school hallways.</p>
        <p>''We were breaking a lot of furniture, so we decided to come here,'' he said.</p>
