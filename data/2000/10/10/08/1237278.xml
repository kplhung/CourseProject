        <p>The Knicks received a scare today when Allan Houston  sprained his left ankle. Houston did not continue to practice but was able to walk back to the club's hotel and said he hoped to practice Sunday.</p>
        <p>Houston, who sat out the first few days of training camp while recuperating from the Olympic Games and his flight from Sydney, Australia, said the injury was not related to any fatigue from his trip.</p>
        <p>''This had nothing to do with how my body felt,'' said Houston, who earlier in the week had trouble adjusting to the 15-hour time difference between Charleston, S.C., and Sydney. ''While I was out there practicing the last few days my body felt really good.''</p>
        <p>Houston initially injured the ankle during last season's playoff series against the Miami Heat and said it did not bother him over the summer. He hurt it today when he drove to the basket and stepped on the rookie Lavor Postell's foot.</p>
