        <p>A plan to build a park on the waterfront between North Seventh and North Ninth Streets hinges on the support of New York University, which has promised money for the project. But some have questioned the role of the Manhattan university in this Brooklyn neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The park space, now a weed-strewn lot, was acquired from its private owners in August by the Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit group, with a loan from N.Y.U. The trust plans to give the land to the state, which, in a partnership with the university, would build and maintain a 262,000-square-foot park along the East River. The state would pay back N.Y.U.'s loan by issuing bonds.</p>
        <p>The park would include playing fields to be built and maintained by the university and shared by residents and N.Y.U. The arrangement will give N.Y.U. sorely needed athletic fields and Williamsburg sorely needed river access and open space.</p>
        <p>But the borough president, Howard Golden, has questioned why a Brooklyn institution is not involved.</p>
        <p>In a letter to state officials, he said the state ''should take no action on a long-term lease for this site prior to hearing from Brooklyn's colleges.''</p>
        <p>Gale Stevens Haynes, provost of Long Island University's Brooklyn campus, said, ''We are disappointed that we did not get much advance notice so that our ideas could get more consideration.'' She said L.I.U. also needed playing fields.</p>
        <p>Some Williamsburg residents say they are concerned about N.Y.U.'s history in dealing with the local community in Greenwich Village, citing criticism of the university for its expansion in that neighborhood. ''Some neighbors are not happy with them,'' said Annette La Matto, executive director of the Northside Community Development Council.</p>
        <p>John Beckman, a spokesman for N.Y.U., defended its presence in the area, saying that N.Y.U. had 8,000 students in Brooklyn and was involved with many community projects in the borough. He added, ''We've been working closely with local groups on this park every step of the way.''</p>
