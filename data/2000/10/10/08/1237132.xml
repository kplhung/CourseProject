        <p>IN the beginning, there were sport utility vehicles, and they were fun.

        <p>The whole point of luxury S.U.V.'s, however, is to keep the outside world at bay. These vehicles are plush, powerful, imposing and popular, but they are not much fun.</p>

        <p>IN the beginning, there were sport utility vehicles, and they were fun. The postwar Jeeps and Land Rovers, the International Scouts, the Ford Broncos -- you could drive them almost anywhere, or try to. And because they were rude and crude, the driver and passengers were very much part of the action.</p>
        <p>The whole point of luxury S.U.V.'s, however, is to keep the outside world at bay. These vehicles are plush, powerful, imposing and popular, but they are not much fun.</p>
        <p>Part of this is because of their bulk, and in that respect, the Infiniti QX4 scores higher than most on the smile-o-meter. It casts the same shadow as the rather compact Nissan Pathfinder, and it is the same mechanically, so it is far more agile and sporting than the likes of the Cadillac Escalade or Lincoln Navigator. In size, performance and price, it is closer to the Mercedes ML320.</p>
        <p>Still, the QX4 buyer is getting what is, essentially, a dressed-up Nissan. The fanciest Pathfinder, the LE, actually has more luxury equipment, like a power sunroof, than the plainest QX4. Similarly equipped, a four-wheel-drive Pathfinder LE has a sticker of $33,818, compared with $37,625 for the Infiniti. A lease customer could spend $50 or $100 a month more for the QX4.</p>
        <p>What do you get for the extra $4,000? More coddling, according to customer surveys that rank Infiniti retailers at or near the top of all dealerships. More insulation, with a softer, quieter ride. And a cabin swathed in buttery leather and fake but convincing bird's-eye maple trim, including the option of a rich wood-and-leather steering wheel that could have been shoplifted from Jaguar (if only the wood were real).</p>
        <p>The QX4 is as reassuringly solid as the Pathfinder, though it feels considerably heavier than the actual 53-pound difference indicated in the official specifications. There is certainly far more padding and insulation in the Infiniti.</p>
        <p>Until recently, the QX4 had one big advantage in its full-time four-wheel-drive system, but that is now available on the Pathfinder LE, as are Infiniti's navigation unit and a new entertainment system with a videocassette player and a 6.4-inch video screen that flips down from the roof. (Its sound is delivered through the audio system or through wireless headphones.)</p>
        <p>So those who opt for the QX4 must prefer its added isolation and more formal styling, capped by a new, more prominent bar that sits across the grille like a suitcase handle, flanked by high-intensity Xenon headlamps.</p>
        <p>The interior is undeniably pleasant, with an elegantly detailed plate of bright metal around the shifter, Infiniti's signature analog clock and three impressive cup holders for the front seats alone.</p>
        <p>The navigation system has a new gimmick: the capability to display maps in ''birdview,'' a quasi-three-dimensional image in which the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge rise out of a flat plane. While intriguing to watch, it is not particularly practical when navigating.</p>
        <p>In general, the navigation system is no more useful, and no less distracting, than most of the breed. In other words, people who can read maps may find a $9.95 Rand McNally atlas just as valuable as this $2,000 option. And the QX4's unit is installed in place of a device I like much better, a six-disk in-dash changer for audio CD's. (With the navigation system, you get a CD changer in the rear compartment instead.)</p>
        <p>Though you can play music CD's in the dashboard unit that reads navigation disks, you cannot use it that way if you are getting route guidance. This leads to fumbling, and yet more distraction, as music and navigation disks are inserted and removed.</p>
        <p>Aside from this bit of unnecessary equipment, it's hard to fault the QX4. Since it performs much like the Pathfinder, it holds its own against most of the S.U.V.'s with off-road capability. It feels more staid and less sporting than the Nissan, but that is what many luxury-truck buyers are looking for.</p>
        <p>In any case, it is more sensibly sized and configured than a lot of S.U.V.'s., and probably more fun to drive. But, come to think of it, so is the Pathfinder.</p>
        <p>INSIDE TRACK: Rich relation.</p>
