        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I recently read a 1961 Pyramid Book edition of Thorne Smith's ''Night Life of the Gods.'' It was completely captivating in how it used mythology as a comic premise and in how it presented a time capsule of 1931 society.</p>
        <p>Scott Veale's well-balanced and entertaining essay on Smith (''Drinking Gin With the Dead,'' Sept. 10) made me feel that I was no longer an island but rather part of the mainland of readers who know that comic literature can address serious subjects. When we lost the art of making the perfect martini, we also seem to have lost the formula for producing comic literature that does not insult the intelligence of the reader.</p>
