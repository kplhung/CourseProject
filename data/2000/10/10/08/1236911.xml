        <p>THE most notable physical feature of the home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra is plainness. It is less a ''concert hall'' than a large rectangular room. The floor is exposed wood. The downstairs seats, with their hard, thin upholstery, are removable. The gilt proscenium is topped by a medallion reading, ''Beethoven''; eight flanking medallions are blank. This is a functional space in which to hear music -- or at most, a spare church in which to worship it. Even the name is plain: Symphony Hall.</p>
        <p>Equally distinctive are the hall's acoustics, world-famous for warmth, clarity and presence. The coffered ceiling, the open grillwork of the two balconies, the niches and statuary -- all of which shun the flat surfaces faulted by acousticians -- partly account for these long-admired sonic properties.</p>
        <p>The Boston Symphony, which has played there for a century, is unthinkable without Symphony Hall, and it takes understandable pride in celebrating the hall's 100th birthday beginning this week with a pair of special concerts and a daylong open house.</p>
        <p>Not least among the hall's virtues is its exquisite sense of place. No such auditorium could exist in New York or Vienna or Leipzig, even though the old Leipzig Gewandhaus was one of its models. It honors Boston's Puritan legacy and also the sense of history this city so early acquired: it looked old the day it opened.</p>
        <p>If the hall had a human face, it would be that of the individual who built it and who modestly refused to bequeath his name: Henry Lee Higginson, a man who knew exactly what he wanted and how to get it.</p>
        <p>In his early 20's, he diligently studied music in Vienna. Though he decided that his musical gift was limited and became a stockbroker instead, music remained his passion. He dreamed of creating a world-class concert orchestra for Boston, and when he had amassed enough money, that is what he did, in 1881. No one else, ever, has so single-handedly shaped and managed so ambitious and successful an orchestral enterprise.</p>
        <p>Higginson's Boston Symphony had no board of directors; Higginson himself paid all salaries, including that of the music director, whom he chose. He also made up all deficits. By 1889, his conductor was Germany's rising star, Arthur Nikisch, who in four seasons led 388 of the orchestra's 398 nonsummer concerts, including 196 on tour in 32 cities. The Boston Symphony was already America's best, and comparable to the best abroad.</p>
        <p>And it was Higginson who decided that the orchestra needed a new home to take the place of Boston's Music Hall, deplored for its poor ventilation and susceptibility to fire. He disliked New York's new Music Hall, built by Andrew Carnegie, with its 2,800 seats disposed in a tiered operatic horseshoe. He wanted something much simpler and somewhat smaller, with a capacity of 2,500 or 2,600.</p>
        <p>For an architect, Higginson chose Charles Follen McKim, of the celebrated New York firm McKim, Mead &amp; White. Old World royalty would have declared cost irrelevant; Higginson wrote McKim: ''As I must bear the burden of the new hall, perhaps quite alone, and as I keep my purse fairly depleted all the time, I must not -- cannot -- spend too much money.'' Actually, these instructions were aesthetic; Higginson also wrote to McKim: ''I always like the severe in architecture, music, men and women, books.''</p>
        <p>McKim accepted the commission and proposed a novel and elegant design based on a Greek amphitheater. Higginson's response: ''We feel afraid to try any experiments. While we hanker for the Greek theater plan, we think the risk too great as regards results, so we have definitely abandoned that idea. We shall therefore turn to the general plan of our Music Hall and of the halls in Vienna and Leipsic, the latter being the best of all.''</p>
        <p>So McKim copied the rectangular plan of the Leipzig Gewandhaus, shorn of its fulsome Germanic decoration. Also, with a capacity of 1,560, the Gewandhaus was too little. It was assumed that the Boston hall should be enlarged proportionately in all its dimensions. But Higginson's crowning inspiration was to engage a young Harvard acoustician, Wallace Sabine. Sabine advised him of the superiority of angles to curves. He cautioned against a stage too high or deep (hence the modest capacity of the Symphony Hall stage, requiring a forward extension for oratorios and the like). And crucially, Sabine told Higginson that simply to increase the linear dimensions of the hall by 30 percent would result in a space far too large for optimum projection. Symphony Hall became the first such structure to be planned with the laws of acoustical science consciously in play.</p>
        <p>Higginson also proceeded to mastermind the fund-raising campaign for construction. The hall was actually ready on time. But it was not finished according to McKim's expectations. Tellingly, Higginson failed to provide the anticipated external statuary. And spaces left for inscriptions, inside and out, were also left naked. In New York, The Musical Courier called the result ''cheerless'' and ''cold,'' and compared it to a ''religious establishment.''</p>
        <p>At the inaugural concert, on Oct. 15, 1900, Higginson praised McKim (who was notably absent) for graciously abandoning his original plan in support of another ''not entirely to his liking.'' He also said, ''It is fitting in a republic that the citizens and not the government in any form should do such work and bear such burdens.''</p>
        <p>The admiration and gratitude Higginson expressed toward his co-workers on this occasion has been returned many times. He had given his permanent full-time concert orchestra -- an institution unprecedented in its day -- a permanent home.</p>
        <p>All of the foregoing is lovingly documented in two stylish books commissioned or produced by the Boston Symphony for the hall's centenary: ''The Making of Symphony Hall, Boston,'' by Richard Poate Stebbins, and ''Symphony Hall: The First 100 Years.'' (An even more appropriate tribute to Higginson would be for the orchestra to commission a proper account of its own distinguished history.) But as it happens, Henry Higginson has been more roughly treated by American cultural historians. He is portrayed as an imperious plutocrat who imposed his taste and lashed his employees, ''highhanded'' and ''paternalistic,'' the epitome of ''stiff-backed autocracy and social frigidity.'' The most famous portrait of Higginson, by John Singer Sargent (a picture Higginson disliked), shows a looming physical presence, haughty and elevated.</p>
        <p>Actually, Higginson was a stocky man admired for the warmth of his personal friendships. His biographer Bliss Perry, who knew him well, called him ''soldierly'' and ''erect,'' prone to ''abrupt'' and ''vigorous'' speech. His opinions, both political and aesthetic, were decisively conservative; he thought nothing of advising his conductors of his distaste for Wagner and Richard Strauss. But even those decisions for which he is today censured served a greater good. He forbade his men to unionize: a prohibition that permitted the engagement of superior European instrumentalists the orchestra badly needed. He insisted that they not play ''dance music'' from Wednesday to Saturday, when the orchestra rehearsed and performed: a restriction that insured a caliber of commitment never before known among Boston's motley orchestras.</p>
        <p>And when it came to audiences, Higginson was a considerable democrat. He instituted workingmen's concerts and the summer series that became the Boston Pops. At the Music Hall, he set aside 1,000 25-cent ''rush tickets'' on Friday afternoons; an hour before concert time, women of all ages, students and other nonsubscribers would race into the second balcony, which filled within minutes. This practice was retained at Symphony Hall, which, with its shallow balconies, had no bad seats.</p>
        <p>WHEN the orchestra's first conductor, George Hen schel, stepped down in 1884, the audience rose and sang ''Auld Lang Syne'' at his final concert. Of the local composers the Boston Symphony championed, the favorite was George Chadwick, whose Scherzo in F was the first music for which the audience demanded, and received, an encore. On such occasions, Boston Symphony concerts were cultural community meetings, securing a special bonding of music, auditors and venue.</p>
        <p>Cultural historians too often depict the orchestras and art museums of the late Gilded Age as an elitist refuge from social strife, insulated by rituals of decorous behavior. They picture philanthropists shackled by timid taste and psychological need, influential citizens whose notions of cultural uplift revealed anxious disapproval of restless immigrant masses.</p>
        <p>But this picture is overdrawn and overgeneralized. The museum experience may have been restrained and private, self-conscious and intimidating for neophytes. The Boston Symphony's early audiences, by comparison, were public and communal, articulate and demonstrative.</p>
        <p>And this distinctive ambience was sealed by the town-meeting plainness of Symphony Hall itself. A larger, more opulent, more stratified space -- a Boston Carnegie, in which lesser patrons would have sat hidden beneath the eaves of the topmost balcony -- would have made a different statement altogether than the house that Henry Higginson built, a building in its way as bold and obdurate, severe and warmhearted as the gentleman himself.</p>
