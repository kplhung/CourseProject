        <p>A small, rundown shop at 95 Trinity Place in Lower Manhattan is undergoing extensive renovations. It is probable that its former name, G's Wines and Spirits, meant little at the American Stock Exchange, across the street. The new name, Aulden Cellars, may ring a bell there.</p>

        <p>A small, rundown shop at 95 Trinity Place in Lower Manhattan is undergoing extensive renovations. It is probable that its former name, G's Wines and Spirits, meant little at the American Stock Exchange, across the street. The new name, Aulden Cellars, may ring a bell there.</p>
        <p>Aulden, which is open Monday through Saturday, is the retail partner that enabled Sotheby's to resume New York auctions of fine and rare wines after that house's five-year relationship with Sherry-Lehmann, the upscale Madison Avenue merchant, collapsed last November in a contract dispute.</p>
        <p>Under state law, independent auction houses can hold wine auctions only if they team up with a retailer that has owned a liquor license for 10 consecutive years. Sotheby's withdrawal left the lucrative secondary market primarily to Christie's, its archrival, whose partner is Zachys, a carriage-trade merchant in Scarsdale, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, Connoisseur Encounters, an Illinois company that sells fine wines, bought Sunrise Liquors and Wines, a shop in Greenlawn, on Long Island, and renamed the acquisition Aulden Cellars. The company negotiated the alliance with Sotheby's and relocated the business to the financial district.</p>
        <p>Aulden's manager, Achim Huesgen, a onetime importer of German wine, said: ''Wall Street wants boutique wines. We will be a specialty shop.'' Mr. Huesgen said California wines would be an early emphasis. He added that he had ordered year-end Champagnes and would stock mid- and high-priced Bordeaux and Burgundy. A visitor found unfamiliar California labels like Hans Fahden and Lions Peak cabernet sauvignons and Domaine Felipe chardonnay.</p>
        <p>Work has been under way since July, and Mr. Huesgen said, ''I hope the store will be fully ready by Nov. 1.''</p>
        <p>A rear office handles only auction matters like buyers' deliveries. It may be busy. Sotheby's season-opening wine auction on Sept. 16 grossed $3,016,605 (including buyers' premiums), its fourth-largest New York total. Ninety-eight percent of the 1,405 lots offered were sold.</p>
