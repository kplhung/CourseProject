        <p>AMONG the world's major currencies, the dollar has reigned supreme this year, climbing 14 percent against the euro and 5 percent against the yen. While that has meant bargain travel for American tourists, it has generally meant miserable returns for Americans holding foreign mutual funds.</p>
        <p>According to Morningstar Inc., foreign funds lost 10.69 percent of their value through the third quarter, compared with a small loss of 1.54 percent in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.</p>
        <p>Those few foreign funds that have done well this year generally concentrated on picking stocks, not on hedging their currency risks. Still, debates over to what extent investors should venture back into foreign funds often turn into debates over currencies, especially the euro.</p>
        <p>For the first three quarters, Morningstar found 29 individual funds in positive territory, with 15 having returns above 5 percent.</p>
        <p>The Ivy International Small Companies fund, one of the top performers, returned better than 21 percent for the nine months. Miranda Richards of Henderson Investors in London, the fund's manager, attributed the results entirely to stock-picking, with no currency hedges to bolster the results.</p>
        <p>''There are very good small-cap companies that are global leaders in niche businesses,'' and her job is to find them, Ms. Richards said. Because the companies are small, she is often able to meet with the company's top management, not just the investor relations staff. As a result, she said, she has a better opportunity to know a company well than do managers of funds that invest in large-cap companies.</p>
        <p>One of her core holdings is Rational, a German company that has 41 percent of the world market for  some specialized ovens used by professional cooks. She bought shares in the initial public offering earlier this year and expects 40 percent annual growth in the stock price. Another favorite is CSL, an Australian company that is a leader in blood plasma products.</p>
        <p>If investors have the appropriate horizon of five years or more, she said, they will have less reason to worry about exchange rates. ''On this fund, we have no hedges at all at the moment,'' she said. ''We do not do very much hedging, because over the long term, currency fluctuations are less important.''</p>
        <p>Sheridan Reilly said that the Ivy Funds, where he is international equities chief, are now unhedged but  would consider currency hedges when they would be likely to enhance returns or preserve capital. If a portfolio were ''overhedged,'' he said, ''it could limit the upside.''</p>
        <p>THE costs of hedging can vary widely, he said, from ''negligible'' in Japan, where interest rates are extremely low, to punishingly expensive in politically or economically less stable countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, where short-term interest rates have been more than 25 percent in recent years. ''That means you're agreeing to give up 25 percent if you hedge,'' he said, because hedges are a function of interest rates. In such conditions, he added, ''we exit the market.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly said Ivy's approach was twofold -- stock-picking based on a thorough five-year review of individual companies and on disciplined portfolio construction. He cited Siemens of Germany as a favorite. ''Over the past five years, it has slowly transformed itself from quasi-state-owned to a vibrant entrepreneurial company,'' he said. He also likes Nokia of Finland, despite its recent tumble on an earnings warning.</p>
        <p>In constructing a portfolio, Mr. Reilly said, Ivy looks for companies with price-to-earnings ratios below the market's, earnings growth rates and return on equity above the market's, and price-to-book ratios near the market's.</p>
        <p>''American investors should have up to 30 percent of their holdings in foreign equities,'' he said. ''There are tremendous opportunities.'' But they should go in only for the long term -- three to five years -- he added.</p>
        <p>An independent investment adviser, Michael Stolper, had similar views. His San Diego firm, Stolper &amp; Company, works with institutions and wealthy individuals, often by investing directly in domestic stocks and using mutual funds for international holdings. Among the funds he likes are Acorn International, Oakmark International, Tweedy Brown Global Value, Harbor International Growth and the various Templeton funds.</p>
        <p>''We still have about a 20 to 25 percent weighting overseas,'' Mr. Stolper said, a proportion with which he was happy. Asked if he looked for funds that hedged for currency fluctuations, Mr. Stolper said: ''I'd probably be more nervous if they told me they were fully hedged than if they weren't. The cost of hedging can be awesome.</p>
        <p>''The longer I'm alive, the less conviction I have that anyone can predict currencies with accuracy,'' Mr. Stolper said. ''I'm surprised at the strength of the dollar and the weakness of the euro. It's a rotational pattern.''</p>
        <p>Does that mean that today's depressed euro offers a buying opportunity for American investors? ''There could be a tactical advantage,'' Mr. Stolper said, if new money or tax-sheltered retirement-account money is to be deployed. But he said he would not advise selling holdings with a big taxable capital gain to go into a European fund now. Attempts to time the market are usually ''exercises in vanity over economics,'' Mr. Stolper said.</p>
        <p>Peter Harrison, head of the global portfolios group at Chase Fleming Asset Management in London, which markets funds in 44 countries including the United States, said the long-term results of an investing strategy were clearer when portfolios were left unhedged. ''We don't, as a rule, hedge any of our portfolios,'' he said. ''First and foremost, we are great believers that stocks matter. History and academic evidence show that performance is driven much more by companies than by where they are listed.''</p>
        <p>Many American investors, enjoying strong domestic markets and the strong dollar, have not felt a need to diversify overseas, Mr. Harrison said. But he thinks Europe will follow the United States in the growth cycle, and he said he was optimistic about the euro for the long term. ''We feel it is being dragged down by sentiment,'' he said, ''and by European companies buying U.S. assets -- $150 billion this year.''</p>
        <p>But Richard Gluck, senior vice president and head of the fixed-income team at the Ivy Funds, said the euro ''is not likely to be strong any time soon.'' He gave several reasons: ''Europeans are investing heavily in the United States. Japanese are liquidating European positions, putting pressure on the euro. The United States has an extraordinarily strong economy with high productivity levels. The oil-price rise hits Europe twice because oil is priced in dollars, and the E.C.'s central bank has been pursuing an anti-inflation policy.''</p>
        <p>Germans have been buying United States Treasury bonds, he noted, and given the dollar's strength against the euro, ''they are up 26 percent this year.''</p>
        <p>Still, ''things do change over time,'' Mr. Gluck said. ''The euro will find its base level,'' he added. ''So be diversified; don't catch the wave after it has moved 20 percent.''</p>
