        <p>THE Sologne is a vast, flat expanse lying south of the Loire just beyond Orleans. It stretches from the chateau of Chambord in the west to the hills of Sancerre in the east. A haunting landscape of forests and ponds, it is one of France's premier game regions and one of my favorites for downright good eating.</p>
        <p>Road signs warn ''Large Animal Crossing.'' When I visited in mid-November with two friends, we didn't come face to face with any boar or deer but we often had to brake for pheasants. Which didn't stop us from  enjoying one of their cousins at the table. (Fresh game is served mid-September to mid-January.)</p>
        <p>Solognot cooking is frank, full-flavored and hearty. Its game terrines are outstanding, as are its winey stews and blood-thickened civets; in season, wild mushrooms garnish just about everything. From its  ponds come such freshwater fish as pike and carp. The cheese course is dominated by local chevre, notably crottin de Chavignol, and the most emblematic dessert is tarte Tatin, the apple pie said to have been invented by the Tatin sisters in the Solognot town of Lamotte-Beuvron. Wines from the  Loire are featured on most lists, with an  emphasis on those nearest to hand, from Sancerre, Menetou-Salon and Cheverny.</p>
        <p>I have lived in the Loire part of the year for the past 10 years. As a result, I know the owners of the Grand Hotel du Lion d'Or and C'Heu l'Zib and I was recognized at Le Raboliot.</p>
        <p>Grand Hotel du Lion d'Or  Romorantin-Lanthenay</p>
        <p>The Lion d'Or, judging from my visits over several years, is the best restaurant in the Loire Valley. Exemplary in every sense of the word, it fully merits its two Michelin stars. Service is perfect, under the direction of Marie-Christine Clement, who runs the restaurant that her parents started (and where they still work). The setting is luxurious, a 17th-century carriage house updated with plush carpets and smoked mirrors and the occasional magnificent flourish, like a stupendous chandelier with real candles and a luxuriant bouquet of fresh flowers. And the food, prepared by Didier Clement, the chef, is exquisite, starting with a profusion of amuse-bouches: a slice of excellent hare terrine, for example, a saucer of fricasseed girolles and a tray of canapes.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clement, who has written several cookbooks featuring her husband's recipes, obviously enjoys explaining the history of a sauce or a particular preparation. She cautioned us that her husband's risotto was not classic. In fact, it was mostly wild rice -- wild rice from heaven. Brightened with zests of orange and lemon, it showcased fat, perfectly cooked langoustines. The whole sat on a sauce of langoustine stock surrounded by a drizzle of excellent vinaigrette. It was endlessly appetizing, a succession of brilliant, clear flavors.</p>
        <p>I can't think of the last time I've seen a vol-au-vent (a puff pastry shell) on an up-to-the-minute French menu. So it was with pleasure mixed with curiosity that I ordered Mr. Clement's version. What a treat! The puff pastry was light as air and encased a  heap of girolles seasoned with chives and  bathed in a deep, woodsy sauce. On top  was a slice of juicy foie gras.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clement has a way with game. His saddle of hare in a sweet-and-sour sauce, sampled several years ago, was the finest game dish I could remember. On this visit, the saddle of hare was again stellar. A portion for two, it was tender as butter and complemented by a tasty sauce smitane, a blend of hare stock and creme fraiche. Excellent peppery noisettes of venison came on a lightly sweet-tart sauce made from unsugared grape jam and were accompanied by beets, pearl onions and the unusual, sweet-tart physalis peruviana, also known as cape gooseberry. In addition to their individual garnishes, main courses came with souffled potatoes as delectable as Joel Robuchon's mashed potatoes.</p>
        <p>You can order a single dessert, but Mr. Clement prefers to concoct an assortment of three. Ours consisted of individual chocolate souffles served with praline ice cream, an intriguing gingerbread soup garnished with cardamom and date ice cream and a wedge of gingerbread, and a wonderful combination of fig ice cream, cream of date sauce,  toasted almonds and pistachios.</p>
        <p>The wine list at Lion d'Or is superb. Two excellent options are the '97 Saumur Blanc Chateau de Villeneuve, les Cormiers ($42, at 7.6 francs to $1), a resonant white with rich, ripe fruit and mellow flavors of oak that was brilliant with the langoustines; and the '96 Chinon Coteau de Noire from Philippe Alliet ($46), a fine-grained, deeply fruity red.</p>
        <p>C'Heu l'Zib  Menetou-Salon</p>
        <p>I can't imagine going to the eastern Loire without stopping for a meal at this sentimental favorite with its warmhearted ambiance right out of Pagnol. (The name is the local dialect for Chez Zib -- Zib being a nickname for the restaurant's founder.)</p>
        <p>The restaurant is owned by Marie-Claude Fontaine, the cook, an outgoing woman who succeeded her parents. It occupies the corner of the main square of Menetou-Salon, a wine-making village. From its well-worn floors to its sagging beamed ceilings it is crammed with copper pots, dried flowers and faience.</p>
        <p>On my last visit the main room had been taken over for a celebratory meal for the local recipients of the coveted Meilleur Ouvrier de France award, given for artisanal accomplishment in everything from woodworking to cooking. In a cozy side room we shared a long table (and some spirited conversation) with a local hiking club. The meal unfolded with reassuring consistency: the customary bottle of white Menetou-Salon (a '98 from Jean-Paul Gilbert, $13) was set on the table along with a  bottle of creme de cassis so we could make our own kirs. There is no menu; a waitress announced the choices.</p>
        <p>We opted for white asparagus served with a tangy mustard emulsion, as well as a pair of flavorful terrines accompanied by home-cured garlic and cornichons. Every meal includes Marie-Claude's version of a classic Solognot dish, pike in a luscious cream sauce. Then came sensational roast boar, tasting like the free-range pig that it is, and a toothsome stew of guinea hen laced with whiskey. Roast potatoes and braised endives were served family style, as were salad and a plate of chevres.  The immutable house charlotte au chocolat was as delicious as ever, and summer's preserves -- plums, pears and grapes in syrup or alcohol -- were just what was wanted with coffee and a shot of local eau de vie.</p>
        <p>Auberge des Templiers  Boismorand</p>
        <p>At the northeast limits of Sologne, this restaurant, which has two Michelin stars, offers classic haute-bourgeoise cuisine. Owned by the Depee family, it is sprawling yet stately, a succession of salons and dining rooms with thick chintz curtains, enormous Dutch chandeliers and highly polished breakfronts. The hunt theme is played out in paintings and drawings, and with mounted stag's and boar's heads. In season, there is a long a la carte menu of game dishes.</p>
        <p>It is to the restaurant's credit that it has kept quality at a consistent high despite the turnover of chefs in the course of its 50-year history. Now the kitchen is in the able hands of Christophe Eme, whose mastery was evident in everything we tasted, starting with cromesqui, in which a half dozen fat oysters are treated to light-as-air breading and split-second frying, retaining all their succulence, and with a superb game terrine with foie gras  and a garnish of fig compote.</p>
        <p>A large pheasant wing, stuffed with wild mushrooms, liver and coriander, was posed on a bed of trompettes de la mort mushrooms and garnished with such ''forgotten vegetables'' as the tiny, knobby tuber called crosne.  Solognot pike was baked under a crust of gingerbread spices, and garnished with cepes and salsify. Subtle and satisfying.</p>
        <p>For dessert, the souffle Rothschild,  nicely doused with Grand Marnier, is the house specialty, and it is perfect -- eggy and billowy, dotted with bits of candied fruit. A scoop of vanilla ice cream is ladled in at tableside.</p>
        <p>The Auberge des Templiers is also known for its long, excellent (and pricey) wine list from which we chose two gems: the '96 Sancerre blanc La Grande Cote from Francis Cotat, $55, a tender white accented with honey and lime; and a '95 Sancerre rouge Cuvee Speciale from Lucien Crochet, $51, a silky pinot noir.</p>
        <p>La Solognote  Brinon-sur-Sauldre</p>
        <p>On weekends this restaurant is filled with Parisians with second homes nearby, some accompanied by  hunting dogs, others in hunting gear. Though service can be brusque, La Solognote, which has one Michelin star, is a welcoming spot, with its Gien plates, hunt-related bric-a-brac and very good food.</p>
        <p>Appetizers brought yet another excellent game terrine, this one made of wild duck studded with pistachios and bits of dried fruit. There was also a soothing soup of cepes and a savory rethinking of tarte Tatin -- a light pastry crust with thinly sliced scallops molded over chopped cepes. It was delicious.</p>
        <p>The chef, Dominique Girard, offers a variation on Lievre a la Royale, an awesomely rich hare stew said to have been invented in the 19th century by a senator from the Poitou region. In Mr. Girard's version the meat is boned and formed into large patties with sweetbreads, liver and mushrooms that are poached, sauteed and served with their cooking juices. They are very, very good, as is the accompanying pasta tossed with cepes. Pheasant confit served in phyllo pastry is tasty and moist and served with cepes and foie gras.</p>
        <p>Desserts brought an eggy creme brulee along with chocolate sorbet and a delectable gratin of fig, grapes and pear in a marc-spiked sabayon. A solid selection of Loire wines includes the '97 Menetou-Salon rouge from Clement ($17), a medium-bodied pinot noir.</p>
        <p>La Perdrix Rouge  Souvigny-en-Sologne</p>
        <p>La Perdrix Rouge, in a tiny timbered house in the beguiling village of Souvigny-en-Sologne, is the very image of a country auberge: a fire in the hearth, low beamed ceilings, ornately carved breakfronts and rustic chandeliers. Dominique Beurienne, wife of the chef-owner Jean-Noel Beurienne, is a tad starchy, but well meaning. In all, it's warm and inviting.</p>
        <p>We had heard that the restaurant specialized in seafood so when oysters from Roscoff Bay were offered, we leaped at them. Fat and fresh as a sea breeze, they reminded us that early winter is a great season for oysters. Monkfish, lightly stuffed with tomato and red pepper and served in a sublime cream sauce seasoned with sorrel, was also top notch.</p>
        <p>Despite its maritime orientation, the restaurant has an extensive special menu devoted to game. Everything we tasted in this realm was hugely satisfying. There was, of course, perdrix rouge, but as it's said to be less gamey than the perdrix grise, I opted for the grise. An entire bird, roasted with thyme, it was dark and meaty and deliciously mellow. It came with girolles and cepes that had been pan-fried with garlic, roasted shallots and garlic cloves, a potato gratin, purees of carrots and celeriac, green beans and a toothsome little saute of white meat and mushrooms. Excellent, too, were nuggets of hare in a sauce of stock, cream and tarragon; and the tender haunch of venison in a sauce Grand Veneur, a classic brown sauce, with wild cranberries, spiced pears and girolles.</p>
        <p>Tarte Tatin again! And super nougat glace, liberally studded with praline. The strong point on the restaurant's wine list is its Bordeaux at reasonable prices, of which our smooth and structured '88 Chateau les Ormes de Pez at $40 was a perfect case in point.</p>
        <p>Le Raboliot  Nouan-le-Fuzelier</p>
        <p>On a cold, rainy Thursday our threesome arrived in Nouan-le-Fuzelier at 1:30, the hour beyond which any restaurant in the French provinces would refuse to seat us. There was no time to dither -- even though the prospects were inauspicious: the front half of the restaurant was a smoke-filled cafe with pinball machines (since removed) and men studying racing forms at the bar. And our destination, the restaurant gastronomique (fake wainscoting, gauzy pink curtains) was entirely empty. Just order the $15 menu and forget about it, I thought.</p>
        <p>Then Philippe Henry, the owner and a complete wine nut, overheard us discussing Bordeaux (where my friends work) and figured he'd found some kindred spirits. Before we knew it, we were tucking into an elaborate  terrine in which chunks of foie gras and hare marbled a wine-colored gelee made from the cooking juices of a long-simmered rabbit stew. Next came an honest civet of boar with deeply infused flavor and a tasty pheasant dish presenting two juicy legs, a patty of boned meat and an abundance of wild mushrooms on a sauce sweetened with wild cranberries. We then dug into succulent, nicely caramelized tarte Tatin.</p>
        <p>And all the while Mr. Henry pulled obscure wines out of his cellar -- a light but structured '96 Chateaumeillant pinot noir from the Chateaumeillant Caves Cooperative ($16), for example, and a '95 Chenin Nectar des Anges Vendanges Tardives ($24), a honey-tinged off-dry white from the Confrerie des Vignerons de Oisly et Thesee.</p>
        <p>When we finally managed to extricate ourselves at 6 p.m. we were bordering on the effusive, as well as the mellow: if only every small town in France had a restaurant of this quality.</p>
