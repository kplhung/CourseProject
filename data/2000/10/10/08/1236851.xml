        <p>NOT ONE OF THE BOYS</p>
        <p>Living Life as a Feminist.</p>
        <p>By Brenda Feigen.</p>
        <p>Knopf, $26.</p>
        <p>''The personal is the political,'' the motto of feminists in the 1960's and 70's, does not appear in Brenda Feigen's memoir, ''Not One of the Boys.'' The omission is curious because the book traces the events that formed Feigen's political consciousness, from being denied use of the squash courts at Harvard Law School in 1967 to not being allowed on the set of a Hollywood action movie she produced in 1988. The first two-thirds of the narrative alternates between accounts of discrimination and descriptions of Feigen's work in the women's movement, which include helping found Ms. Magazine and working with Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project. The book is most interesting when recounting the machinations of feminist organizing during its heyday and when explaining the fine points of legal debate on issues like the equal rights amendment and labor law. Far less interesting are descriptions of Feigen's later experiences. The final third of the book assesses sexism in Hollywood, pornography as a political issue and the current state of feminism. Feigen's analyses lack depth. On Hollywood wives she writes: ''The major difference between prostitutes and wives is that the latter have children to justify their marriages to men.'' Few of Feigen's colleagues escape ad hominem (or ad feminam) attacks in this censorious but interesting memoir.</p>
