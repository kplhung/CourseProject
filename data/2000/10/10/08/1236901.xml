        <p>FOR more than a year, ''Play,'' a genre-straddling collection of electronic dance songs by the techno auteur known as Moby, has been an oddity among the usual suspects -- teen idols, slick VH-1 stalwarts, rappers, R-and-B divos and divas, truculent frat rockers, Shania Twain -- hovering in the top half of the Billboard 200 album chart. The record is a big hit. It has sold one million copies in the United States, and has been on the Billboard charts for 59 straight weeks; overseas, where techno is more entrenched in the pop mainstream, ''Play'' has sold an additional three million copies.</p>
        <p>In an age of blockbuster albums, those numbers are not earth-shattering, but ''Play'' has achieved a kind of ubiquity that has eluded even superstars like 'N Sync and Celine Dion. Moby has licensed all 18 of the album's tracks for commercial use. ''Honey,'' an urgent, up-tempo dance tune driven by a sample from a decades-old blues recording, was used in two different soap operas; the lush synthesizer strains of ''Porcelain'' tinkled on the soundtrack of the Leonardo DiCaprio movie ''The Beach'' and in television commercials for a car, a washing machine and Microsoft. This mass-market saturation has made ''Play'' one of the most-heard of all recent records; people to whom the name Moby means nothing may find themselves humming along to the album's familiar tunes.</p>
        <p>But the currency of ''Play'' (V2 27049) is based on more than rampant product-placement. There is something close to a pop culture consensus about the album: from clubland to Wal-Mart, everyone seems to like it. It is a true crossover phenomenon, which has kept its credibility among electronic dance music's core audience -- one of the most doctrinaire subcultures -- while appealing to more mainstream musical constituencies.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in both commercial terms and in the crucial realm of taste-making, ''Play'' is probably the most successful club-music release since the record industry, hoping for a grunge-rock-like juggernaut, began lumping the music's wild array of styles under the catch-all term electronica. Moby has accomplished this feat without compromise or pandering. ''Play'' is an elegant, completely original concoction of hip-hop breakbeats, ambient textures, distorted guitar riffs and sampled 1930's and 40's gospel and blues field recordings, an album whose iconoclasm does not intrude on its accessibility.</p>
        <p>In the banality of the current pop moment, the chart-conquering apotheosis of Moby -- a bald, impish 34-year-old who makes his records in his Little Italy apartment -- feels like a small miracle. If not a triumph of the renegade ''spirit of rock 'n' roll,'' as some sentimentalists have construed it, Moby's rise is at least an immensely satisfying revenge of the nerds.</p>
        <p>Born Richard Melville Hall, Moby -- whose nickname alludes to the whale created by his great-great granduncle Herman Melville -- has been one of techno's marquee acts for almost a decade. He has also been one of the genre's most controversial figures. The zeal with which Moby sought stardom, and his often sanctimonious outspokenness about environmental issues, veganism and his devout Christianity (in the liner notes to ''Play'' he waxes righteous about topics like fundamentalism and prisoner's rights) made him a pariah in dance music circles for several years before the release of ''Play.'' Above all, techno die-hards have scorned Moby's musical eclecticism. Before becoming a D.J., Moby played guitar and sang in punk bands, and his has always been an adventurous musical personality; his pre-''Play'' output ranged from ''Thousand,'' whose blitzkrieg 1,000 beats per minute earned it a Guinness Book of World Records listing as the fastest single ever in 1993, to the 1996 album ''Animal Rights,'' on which Moby forsook dance music altogether for an excursion into guitar rock.</p>
        <p>Yet the very qualities for which Moby has been maligned are what make ''Play'' a singular record. It moves vivaciously across styles, making connections where other D.J.s' wouldn't dare. The earnestness that can grade into insipidity when Moby gets on his soapbox gives ''Play'' a spaciousness and warmth of feeling often missing in dance music, in which a cult of formal austerity -- glacial synthesizer runs, bristling breakbeats -- congeals at times into decadent aestheticism.</p>
        <p>The music on ''Play'' encompasses everything from muscular big beat tunes in the radio-friendly mode of Fatboy Slim, to spare, spooky trip-hop atmospherics, to ballads that strive for art-rock grandiosity. Some of its songs are instrumental; several feature Moby's monotone talk-singing. What unifies this diverse material is a common mood. ''Play'' is steeped in bluesy pathos.</p>
        <p>THE record's tone is set by Moby's tour de force use of samples from old a cappella blues and gospel records. With an admirably light touch, Moby -- not just a knob-twiddler, but a skilled musician proficient at guitar, bass, drums and keyboards -- has shaped arrangements that underscore but in no way overwhelm the blunt, testifying voices of Bessie Jones, Boy Blue, Bill Landford and the Landfordaires and the other long dead singers he summons to his service. In ''Natural Blues,'' Moby sets Vera Hall's plaint -- ''Oh lordy, trouble so hard/ Don't nobody know my troubles but God'' -- against a background of rumbling piano, bass and drums; Boy Blue's whoops on ''Find My Baby'' are buttressed by brawny beats, a rolling electric guitar break and a number of clever keyboard embellishments and sound effects. The result is a new kind of gospel blues, which brings the genre's stark beauty and emotionalism into the age of beat boxes and laptop soloists.</p>
        <p>The broad popularity of ''Play'' is perhaps more than anything a tribute to the power of spirituals -- their deep and simple questions and confessions. ''Why does my heart feel so bad?/ Why does my soul feel so bad?'' asks the refrain of one of the record's stateliest ballads. At a time when pop music is dominated by above-it-all glibness or by kitsch sentimentality, the genuine feeling of ''Play'' really resonates.</p>
        <p>There has been some understandable skepticism about Moby's appropriation of those charismatic African-American voices. These days, reissued recordings of ''primitive'' American roots music are hip; the ''Anthology of American Folk Music'' and the field recordings of the musicologist Alan Lomax -- several of which Moby samples on ''Play'' -- are big sellers at boutique record shops. Is Moby simply riding the trend: using dead black folks to make an empty fashion statement? Is ''Play'' a white guy's brazen bid for ''soul'' by proxy?</p>
        <p>In fact, Moby's attitude toward his source material is reverent, even wise. Juxtaposing the blues and gospel tunes with ''Bodyrock,'' which winningly samples ''Love Rap'' by the hip-hop pioneers Spoony G and the Treacherous 3, Moby reminds techno fans of the music's place in a continuum of sacred and secular African-African song, whose rhythmic dynamism and testimonial eloquence has remained constant across decades.</p>
        <p>But ''Play'' offers more than history lessons. Moby is at heart a pop classicist, and with ''Play'' he has done something that is still unusual: made a songwriterly electronic dance record. Some D.J.'s strive simply to ignite dance floor excitement.  Others layer beats, tweak time signatures and manipulate dynamics with baroque exuberance. Still others take dance music into the realm of abstract sound collage.</p>
        <p>''Play'' is not as infectious, or flamboyant, or trenchant as some electronica, but it is an exceptionally fulfilling and coherent listening experience. It achieves the kind of song-suite unity one associates with the post-Beatles golden age of the pop-rock LP. Moby's own singing is hushed and self-effacing where his blues and gospel preachers are urgent; thematically, however, the songs on ''Play'' are of a piece -- searching, meditative sketches of spiritual crises and love gone wrong.  That cohesiveness goes a long way toward accounting for the album's mainstream appeal. ''Play'' makes sense to audiences used to records with lyrical content and something approaching a narrative arc. Indeed, ''Play'' may have more in common with albums like Bob Dylan's ''Blood on the Tracks'' and Marvin Gaye's ''What's Going On'' than it does with the latest Chemical Brothers or Aphex Twin collections.</p>
        <p>''Play'' may turn out to be transitional: a point of entry for thousands of new listeners who will eventually make a best-seller of a more challenging, traditionally ''clubby'' techno record. But there are reasons to be skeptical about that scenario.  ''Play'' is unusually intimate.  Moby's lyrics are confessional, describing states of mind (''See myself in the pouring rain/ I watch hope come over me''; ''In my dreams I'm dying all the time'') and fraying relationships (''I never meant to hurt you / I never meant to lie/ So this is goodbye''). The inward-focused intensity of ''Play,'' along with its tight song structures, makes it a good record to listen to on a home stereo -- a record that can be experienced privately, contemplated.</p>
        <p>Few dance records have that quality of intimacy -- nor should they.  The center of electronica culture will always be clubs, whose booming sound systems and spirit of sweaty communality require music that is exhortative and party-propelling.  The hourslong flow of grooves and thudding repetitions that provide such uplift in clubs can't be domesticated; the wailing entreaties of house music divas -- slogans that make sense in the ecstatic setting of the disco, when endorphins churn, or the drugs kick in, or both -- sound inane at home. There will be no cause for shame if others fail where Moby has triumphed: in making a great dance record for people who don't dance.</p>
