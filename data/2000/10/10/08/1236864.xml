        <p>YOU would think we'd have worked it out before the wedding. There were signs, of course.

        <p>Finally, in what ought to have been the revealing clue, we took a prenuptial honeymoon to France, where we based ourselves in my cousin's place in Versailles. My cousin, an intrepid adventurer from Ann Arbor, was married to a French aristocrat and lived in Louis XIV's pharmacist's house, four exotic 17th-century stories within walking distance of the train station. Mark arrived with a bad case of jet lag, soon followed by the usual tummy ailment. Recovered after three days, he spent the better part of the trip preferring Ping-Pong in the garden shed to any other activity, including the palace of Versailles, the abbey at Mont St. Michel, and of course, the distracting lights of Paris.</p>
        <p>You would think the message had got through: your husband-to-be is not a traveler.</p>
        <p>I sympathize with the travel-free. I especially sympathize when the plane is canceled or the quaint hotel sponsors a cockroach dynasty. Mark grew up in Yonkers  and drove each summer as far as Cape Cod, where he removed his shoes as the car crossed the Bourne Bridge and kept them off all summer. Traveling meant leaving the beach for ice cream at the Brewster Store. Who could ask for more?</p>
        <p>Well, I could, apparently. For years I persisted. Leisurely drives up the coast of California; camping along the Blue Ridge; the train to Montreal; house-sitting in Ireland; spring skiing in Chamonix; wine tasting in the Languedoc. These were not disastrous trips, yet Mark's account of them, when we reported back to our friends, was a litany of rotten food, missed connections, torturous beds, bad plumbing and dog poop. Especially dog poop, which he finds abounding in all parts of the world save home.</p>
        <p>How does one resolve this quandary? Where my imagination paints vistas of fog rising out of Alpine valleys, Mark's paints wet sleeping bags and no showers. Where I smell fresh brioche or fish pulled from the Mediterranean, he smells the onset of food poisoning.</p>
        <p>About four years ago, with no formal agreement, I began to let him stay home. Because we have children, negotiations ensued. And because, travel booster that I am, I want the kids to grow up thinking of the planet as their home, I often take them. On our return, I collapse into an amnesia that erases all the excellent reasons why one should never travel with children and leaves only fond memories like their singing ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' in a 14th-century Basque church, a delicious moment that does nothing to make Mark wish he'd been there.</p>
        <p>Other times I leave the gang behind. On these ventures I revert to being pure traveler -- ''alone, unheeded, and near to the wild heart of life'' -- or perhaps squeezed by a crowd speaking a language that sounds like giant insects preparing to attack. For these indulgences I pay a fair price. I make it up by staying home. I clean and restock the fridge, do extra quality kid-time, cook for two weeks. Actually, I like to cook.</p>
        <p>And I have persisted. Last year when I got a Fulbright, I hauled the whole family off to Brussels for five months, where there was Art Nouveau and mussels served with french fries and modern dance and Jacques Brel -- and yes, puppy droppings and lukewarm baths.</p>
        <p>After several weeks of homesickness, Mark took my half-joking suggestion to join the American Club. Spending a few wistful evenings with displaced executives who knew the value of reliable telephones and a full-service drugstore, he felt, if not at home, at least in the company of soul mates.</p>
        <p>My husband is not, as this account may imply, a whiner. He loves good food and the chance to try new dishes; his taste in movies and books can run to the exotic; he appreciates a vista with rare humility and awe. He simply doesn't see the point of roaming the earth in order to enjoy these things. Conversely, I don't view myself as restless or adventure-seeking. I love the waffles we always have on Sundays, the skylight over our own bed. Only that old tune will play in my head, ''On the road again, doo doo doo da doo.''</p>
        <p>''Hear anything?'' I ask Mark, but he smiles and shakes his head.</p>
        <p>My final attempt came last winter, when Mark's old friend Bob called, out of the blue. He was heading to Maui, he said, to visit a guy who'd retired early and had a condo. There was plenty of room; did Mark want to come? ''God, I'd love to,'' Mark said to me when he hung up, ''but the air fare's got to be outrageous.''</p>
        <p>''I've got frequent-flier miles,'' I said.</p>
        <p>He laughed. ''Not enough for Hawaii. And you've always got some plan for those.''</p>
        <p>''Hawaii is a domestic destination,'' I said, ''and I have no travel plans.''</p>
        <p>''But the kids.''</p>
        <p>''They'll be in school.''</p>
        <p>''I don't know if I can get away from work.''</p>
        <p>''Find out,'' I commanded.</p>
        <p>His excuses disposed of, he began to exhibit what I told myself was excitement about the trip. A free place with friends on Maui! Escaping February doldrums! Volcanoes, mahi-mahi, girls in grass skirts!</p>
        <p>Mark's second day there, the e-mail messages started. Too much traffic, pricey restaurants, narrow beaches, jet lag, cramped quarters. Cooled lava was hard on the feet. All those beautiful women were hard on the eyes. No mention of dogs or leaky faucets, but fears of sushi worms and a pronounced nostalgia for the family place on Cape Cod.</p>
        <p>''I give up,'' I said when he'd returned and crawled into bed with an unidentifiable ailment that he insisted on describing as tropical. With a gastrointestinal groan he waved me away.</p>
        <p>Recently I put the question to him: ''Is there anywhere on earth you need to see, anything in whose presence you need to be, before you die?''</p>
        <p>''No,'' he answered.</p>
        <p>''Not the Taj Mahal? Not Madagascar? Not the Grand Tetons? Not Mozart's birthplace? Antoine's in New Orleans?''</p>
        <p>''No.''</p>
        <p>Well there you are. He's right, of course. As I cross these off my list, I shall often be crossing off disappointments -- rarely does the goal meet the traveler's expectations. But what I'll tell him he's missing is the getting there -- the bustle at the train station, the steep path up to the monastery, the unexpected field of lupine, the joy of a glass of good wine after a 16-hour journey. He'll smile and say he knows exactly what he is missing, and then we'll clink glasses and toast la difference.</p>
