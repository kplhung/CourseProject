        <p>Vice President Al Gore, responding to intensifying Republican attacks on his credibility, said today that he did not have a problem with embellishment that should cause concern about his character, and he accused Gov.

        <p>Vice President Al Gore, responding to intensifying Republican attacks on his credibility, said today that he did not have a problem with embellishment that should cause concern about his character, and he accused Gov. George W. Bush of waging personal attacks rather than focusing on issues.</p>
        <p>In a 30-minute conference call with reporters, which was intended to highlight education issues that he will emphasize next week, Mr. Gore took several questions about what Republicans are portraying as a pattern of exaggeration about often incidental matters.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, said Mr. Gore ''seems to have a compulsion to embellish,'' and Republican strategists have made it clear that they will continue to press the issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore acknowledged today that he has made occasional factual mistakes, as when he said in Tuesday's debate that he had accompanied James Lee Witt, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to inspect fire and flooding damage in Texas in 1998. Mr. Gore did visit Texas, but with one of Mr. Witt's deputies, not with Mr. Witt. Mr. Gore has said that he made the mistake because he has frequently made trips of that sort with Mr. Witt.</p>
        <p>In response to questions, Mr. Gore said that he did not have a tendency to embellish his resume and that his misstatements did not point to a deeper character flaw. He then tried to turn the tables, asserting that he does not make personal attacks against Mr. Bush when the governor misstates the facts. He went on to describe two such comments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said it ''could be characterized as an exaggeration'' when Mr. Bush said in the debate that the Gore campaign was outspending the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>''But,'' Mr. Gore said, ''I didn't seize on that as anything other than a mistake that he made. When he said that there were 20,000 new bureaucrats called for in my budget plan, similarly I don't describe that as fictitious or an exaggeration. It's just a mistake on his part.''</p>
        <p>Even as he pointed out Mr. Bush's ''mistakes,'' Mr. Gore said he was not denigrating his rival's character.</p>
        <p>''These are negative personal attacks of the kind I simply do not engage in,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The Republican ticket announced a few weeks ago that they were going to adopt a new strategy of focusing on the issues, but they have completely abandoned that strategy and they are focused almost entirely on personal attacks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore stood by his decision in the debate to illustrate the problem of school crowding by speaking of a 15-year-old girl in Sarasota, Fla., who had to stand in class. In fact, school officials have said, the girl was without a desk for only one day.</p>
        <p>''They tried to make that out to be an exaggeration,'' Mr. Gore said of the Republicans. ''Well, excuse me, her father wrote me a handwritten letter, enclosing a picture on the front page of The Sarasota Herald Tribune of his daughter standing in class on the ninth day of school.''</p>
        <p>If the girl later received a desk, he said, ''that doesn't change the fact that there are 36 students in a classroom designed for 24.''</p>
        <p>He also stood by his rebuff of Mr. Bush's suggestion that Russia should have tried to use its influence to persuade Slobodan Milosevic to leave office in Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said that he was ''not sure it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this dispute there because we might not like the result.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the White House had been doing just that, with President Clinton and American diplomats speaking to their Russian counterparts to solicit their support for democratic change in Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>''I stand by exactly what I said,'' Mr. Gore said today, ''that the instinct to involve them is not wrong but we did not want to invite them to be the mediator if they did not agree to the right outcome.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''It appears that they negotiated an arrangement to keep Milosevic in some form of political power as an opposition leader with his hand still in the affairs of Serbia. That is distinctly contrary to what we would like to see happen.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore will leave on Sunday for Sarasota, Fla., where he planned to prepare for Wednesday's debate in Winston-Salem, N.C. He also planned to speak each day about his education plan.</p>
