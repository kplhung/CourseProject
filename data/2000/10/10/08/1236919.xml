        <p>THE Dayton Contemporary Dance Company that returns to New York this week is both the same and different from the one that performed here in 1998. This black modern-dance company, which opens on Tuesday for a week at the Joyce Theater, is peopled by the strong, humane dancers that New Yorkers have grown to love. Those dancers will perform the usual blend of the old, represented by a revival of Asadata Dafora's 1932 classic, ''Awassa Astrige/Ostrich,'' and the new, epitomized by ''Children of the Passage.'' The new work, a celebration of African-American memories and dreams, is choreographed by Donald McKayle and Ronald K. Brown to music composed and performed live by the Dirty Dozen Brass Band.</p>
        <p>Missing this year, however, is the chief ingredient in the mix that has made the 32-year-old Dayton troupe one of the best-known small modern-dance repertory companies in the nation. Jeraldyne Blunden, who founded the troupe, died suddenly of kidney failure in November. But Blunden, the most practical-minded of visionaries, did provide for a stable artistic and financial future for DCDC, as the company is popularly known.</p>
        <p>That is no small feat in American modern dance. Choreographers whose work has been the raison d'etre of their companies often do not wish for their dances to survive, it seems, seeing institutionalization as antithetical to creativity. For the founders of repertory troupes like DCDC, the future has often been just as problematical. Their companies have been beloved children, most often reared in a determined, endless and gripping struggle against poverty and inattention. ''It's very difficult if you're a founder to separate your work from you,'' Phyllis Brzozowska, executive director of the Dayton troupe, said.</p>
        <p>Foresight and luck played their part in preparing DCDC for a healthy future. Blunden, a MacArthur Fellow and one of five black company directors saluted as Living Legends in 1997 at the Brooklyn Academy's Majestic Theater, began grooming a team of three longtime company members for leadership positions about a decade ago. One of those dancers, Kevin Ward, is now artistic director of the troupe. Another, Blunden's daughter Debbie Blunden-Diggs, is associate artistic director and the director of education at the family-owned Jeraldyne's School of the Dance, a company affiliate. The third member, Dawn Wood, became director of touring.</p>
        <p>''Jeraldyne began getting our input on decisions about running the company, rehearsing and choosing dancers and repertory,'' Mr. Ward said. ''She gradually gave us more and more responsibilities.'' Blunden's advice to Mr. Ward about running the company was to concentrate on what he himself wanted done and on what happened on the stage. She told Mr. Ward that there could be no excuse for audiences' getting a show that was not ready to be seen. And there was no excuse for sloppily created dances, she said. Mr. Ward's new dance, ''Sets and Chasers,'' a playful response to the form and content of its Ellington score, will be performed at the Joyce.</p>
        <p>''What you were doing had to be clear,'' Mr. Ward recalled. ''She used to say that if it didn't make sense in the studio, nothing else would help, even program notes.''</p>
        <p>The luck came in 1997 when the Ford Foundation decided to make an exception for the financially struggling DCDC and include the company in its Working Capital Fund for Minority Cultural Institutions. The fund is a four-year program to provide organizational help and money to significant arts institutions that are led by their founders and that are at a financial and artistic turning point.</p>
        <p>The Dayton company's operating budget had shrunk from $1.5 million to $800,000 over the years, with an accumulated debt of more than $500,000 by 1999. ''DCDC was thought to be so significant that it was included even though it was not really eligible because of its debt,'' Ms. Brzozowska said. ''The company did all the planning, but finances kept going downhill rather than up.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Brzozowska joined DCDC last year as a consultant and was named executive director a few months later. She had previously spent 18 years directing City-Folk, a multicultural presenting and service organization that she founded in Dayton in 1980. ''I felt all the pieces were there but had to be put together and held together,'' she said of DCDC.</p>
        <p>One reason she decided to join the troupe was its board. She found it more dedicated and sensitive than any she had known, she said. But she said the most important reason was Blunden. The two women had a shared history. Like Blunden, Ms. Brzozowska was a native of Dayton, ''a town big enough for things to happen but small enough for people to make a difference,'' she said. And both women had begun their dance training with Josephine and Hermene Schwarz in Dayton.</p>
        <p>''Jeraldyne was a girl from the projects and I was a Polish-American working class girl who, like her, created an organization,'' Ms. Brzozowska said. ''I think that helped with her trusting me.'' Today, DCDC is free of debt and even ended the last two years with surpluses of $140,000 and $84,000, respectively. The company has a budget of $1.2 million, with a roster of 13 senior-company members, a junior company and a 37-week work year.</p>
        <p>The troupe must still overcome the shortsightedness of some dance bookers, even major ones, about presenting dance by black companies. ''Why you, if we can get Ailey?'' is a frequent response by presenters, Ms. Brzozowska said. She also said that the Living Legend festival had an unintended effect on the five black companies involved: many bookers now look upon them as interchangeable, even though each has a distinctive personality. Ms. Brzozowska said presenters regularly ask her, What's different about DCDC? ''People don't say that about white companies,'' she said.</p>
        <p>DCDC has a solid vision of its future. The company will continue to present the kinds of American modern-dance classics by black choreographers for which it became noted during the 1990's, under the aegis of the American Dance Festival's Black Traditions program. But there will be an increased emphasis on new work by new choreographers, some of it created for special projects like ''Inventing Flight,'' a multidisciplinary celebration of the beginning of powered flight that will take place in 2003 in Dayton, where the Wright Brothers were born. DCDC will contribute six dances, including new pieces by Garth Fagan, Bill T. Jones and Doug Varone.</p>
        <p>Part of the job of being a senior-company member is to choreograph; the repertory performed by the junior troupe consists entirely of pieces created by the senior dancers. And the modern dance choreographers Dwight Rhoden and Bebe Miller are expected to join Mr. Ward as resident artists at DCDC, with the company serving as a living repository for Ms. Miller's work.</p>
        <p>Whatever the future holds, DCDC is a modern-dance company that may have an unusually strong chance to live on in the spirit of its founder. Blunden believed in the stern encouragement of the young and the unpracticed. She was among the first to commission dances from Mr. Rhoden and Ulysses Dove, today an internationally known modern-dance choreographer whose work is performed by the New York City Ballet and the Ailey company.</p>
        <p>''A lot of it is expanding on what Jeraldyne began,'' Mr. Ward said of the company's plans. ''A lot of what Jeraldyne taught was by example. She was her brother's keeper. You couldn't leave a dancer behind. You had to make sure they were always part of the team. Old supporters were and are an important part of the organization. Jeraldyne created an atmosphere that is nurturing, that is family, but at the same time is no-nonsense as well.''</p>
