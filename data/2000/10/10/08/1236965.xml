        <p>GOING to the mountains to view the changing leaves has always had an extraordinary effect on me: it makes me hungry. So I've learned to build a little advance planning into October excursions to the state's northwestern reaches -- where, I'm told, we're about to experience one of the most glorious seasons ever, thanks to the cool, rainy summer.</p>
        <p>Sure, fall foliage is great. But when you've seen enough, when darkness descends and the moon rises over the rim of the mountains and the air is flinty with cold and pungent with wood smoke . . . by now your stomach is calling, ''Where do we eat already?''</p>

        <p>GOING to the mountains to view the changing leaves has always had an extraordinary effect on me: it makes me hungry. So I've learned to build a little advance planning into October excursions to the state's northwestern reaches -- where, I'm told, we're about to experience one of the most glorious seasons ever, thanks to the cool, rainy summer.</p>
        <p>Sure, fall foliage is great. But when you've seen enough, when darkness descends and the moon rises over the rim of the mountains and the air is flinty with cold and pungent with wood smoke . . . by now your stomach is calling, ''Where do we eat already?''</p>
        <p>The Walpack Inn has been answering that call since it was founded in 1949 by Adam and Louise Heigis, Bergen County emigrants. It sits near the center of the magnificent Y-shaped greenbelt that comprises Stokes State Forest, High Point State Park and the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.</p>
        <p>The Heigises' son, James, still runs the inn and has expanded it greatly in recent years. Now 350 people can fit into the restaurant's two dining rooms, arranged in tiers so everyone can take in the view through tall picture windows: a vast meadow sloping away toward the gentle rise of the Kittatinny Mountains, a mile or so to the east.</p>
        <p>The inn is open only on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and while I came early and was seated right away, I'm told the wait for a table can be long. Reservations are taken only for groups of eight or more, or for the elderly and handicapped. Others sit minding drinks in the dim, tavernlike bar that held the original restaurant, or browsing the entertainingly bizarre collection of antique farm and household implements that hang from the walls. (Anybody need a sidesaddle? A Marquise pneumatic cleaner? A bottle of Schenick's Seaweed Tonic &amp; Mandrake Pills?)</p>
        <p>In the restaurant itself, service is cheerful and brisk -- as in a well-established diner -- and the big dining rooms are pleasant and airy, with tall ficus trees and enough stuffed animals to stock a small game farm.</p>
        <p>But if you were expecting all these promising trappings to lead to a delightful meal, prepare to be disappointed. The menu is undemanding -- not such a bad thing, you might think, at the end of a long day of mountaineering. Unfortunately, the kitchen seems to have stopped making demands of itself.</p>
        <p>Entrees come with a standard-issue salad bar: lettuce, cucumbers, shredded carrots, spinach, raw broccoli, chickpeas, croutons. While everything is fresh, it's uninspired and, one night, outright unappetizing, cloaked in a miasma of disinfectant and raw-onion smells.</p>
        <p>Back at your table, there's a giveaway basket of the Walpack Inn's only truly notable offering, moist and chewy molasses-scented whole-wheat bread. (For $10 you can buy a whole loaf to take home, though who knows how you'd finish it; it is, indeed, bigger than a breadbox.)</p>
        <p>An appetizer of eight honey-mustard shrimp grilled on two skewers was simple, generous and tasty, and the kitchen did a nice job with a special main course, grilled marlin with a mild, lemony avocado salsa. Prime rib was big, basic and accurately cooked, served with natural juice. Otherwise, the trek from breadbasket to dessert was arid.</p>
        <p>Filet mignon, ordered rare, came well done on the outside, medium rare (though tender and tasty) at the center, with a viscous, tasteless brown sauce. That same sauce, or a variation, stole whatever pleasure was to be had from a rack of lamb that tasted mainly of the garlic in its breading. Pork chops and steak kebab surrendered all their juiciness to the grill. Ham, a touted special on Sundays, had little taste other than salt, and was that side dish of peaches sent over from Newton Memorial Hospital?</p>
        <p>For dessert, there's a light cheesecake with sour-cream topping, and several pleasant homemade pies -- blueberry, raspberry, peanut butter.</p>
        <p>A sign outside the inn reads, ''We feed the deer -- and people too!'' The deer are a big selling point, but I'm not sure I understand what the fuss is about. In two visits I observed a grand total of one deer. It was early evening. Bambi sidled up to a patch of corn kernels laid out a few feet from the picture windows. As flashbulbs popped, it munched for a few minutes, then stood there like a bored stripper, flicking at flies with a hind leg, before wandering back into the woods. Like me, it didn't seem to have enjoyed the meal.</p>
        <p>RINGWOOD</p>
        <p>THIS Passaic County borough in the New Jersey Highlands has some of the best hiking in the state, with 27 miles of trails in Ringwood State Park alone, not to mention the New Jersey State Botanical Garden and the glorious old Ringwood Manor and Skylands Manor mansions. You can work up a powerful appetite taking in all that scenery, and Bella Montagna is the place to satisfy it.</p>
        <p>It would be a mistake to make great claims for this trattoria, whose like are thick on the ground in places closer to the Bloomfields and Hobokens of the world. Still, at Bella Montagna you get solid, fresh, carefully prepared Italian food at fair prices in impeccable surroundings, served by a staff that seems genuinely happy to see you.</p>
        <p>The chef and owner, Sam Nastory, 35, is Armenian, not Italian, but he started out in pizza parlors, and that's where his creative instincts flourished. He likes clear, focused, vibrant flavors, and they stand out in pasta dishes like cavatelli alla Theresa, in which hot peppers make a white sauce of garlic, sweet peppers, shallots, chickpeas and shiitake mushrooms take off like a rocket.</p>
        <p>The chicken in an old-fashioned parmigiana was so tasty that I thought it had been marinated, but not so, Mr. Nastory told me: it's just fresh, never fried ahead of time. Arugula salad was simple, beautiful and almost self-defeatingly generous: with its ample sprinkling of roasted peppers, it could have made a meal, especially with the good semolina bread and home-baked herb-garlic knots in the bread basket.</p>
        <p>And frutti di mare -- clams, mussels, shrimp and calamari over linguine in a garlicky tomato sauce -- was completely over the top. After eating the fresh and perfectly cooked seafood for what seemed like hours, we admitted defeat and asked the waiter to wrap the leftovers so we could take them home. At home, we put the package on the kitchen scale. It weighed two and a half pounds.</p>
        <p>Desserts, as if you had room, can be erratic. They are not made at the restaurant and are not always entirely fresh. Decaf espresso, on the other hand, was rich and bracing, a sure sign of a place that takes care with small matters as well as large ones.</p>
