        <p>To the Editor: The article ''All Together Now,'' by Rick Marin (Sept. 17), interested me a great deal because last February 10 of us, ages 9 to 92, three generations, traveled to Europe. We had two days in London, took the Channel Tunnel to France, and had two days in Paris.</p>
        <p>It was a great success. We walked all over the two cities (yes, the 92-year-old, too) hitting the highlights -- going to the theater and restaurants and even seeing the royal family close up. The young stayed up late, never seemed to tire, and were interested in everything.</p>

        <p>Eighteen of us (three generations) had a wonderful trip to Bermuda in June, too. So if anyone is hesitating about traveling together, I enthusiastically say ''Go for it.''</p>
