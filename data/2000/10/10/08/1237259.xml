        <p>Facing potentially costly suits over a crumbling burial hill built on demolition debris, Cypress Hills Cemetery, the huge graveyard on the border of Brooklyn and Queens, has filed a bankruptcy petition.</p>
        <p>The move is intended to stave off legal actions brought on by the construction and disintegration of the hill, which is 50 feet high.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the cemetery, the 220-acre resting place of many thousands, including Jackie Robinson and Mae West, appeared in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Brooklyn on Sept. 19 to seek protection, a day before the first trial in several suits filed against the cemetery was to start.</p>
        <p>That trial involves $1.1 million that the cemetery is said to owe in connection with the construction of the burial hill in the late 1980's, when compressed rubble from demolished buildings across the city was trucked to the graveyard to form a huge soil-capped mound with room for more than 5,000 bodies.</p>
        <p>That suit is now in limbo, pending the outcome of the bankruptcy case, as are several other suits filed on behalf of relatives of many of the 1,000 people who were buried on the hill, called Terrace Meadow. The plaintiffs assert that they did not know that their relatives were to be buried on top of construction debris.  Most of the graves were dug in the early 1990's, before it became publicly known that the soil on the mound went down only part way and that much of the hill was made of crushed concrete slabs, broken bricks, squashed stoves and other remnants of torn-down buildings.</p>
        <p>Horrified that their relatives rested atop rubble, and saying they should have been told about the hill's composition, many families reburied the bodies elsewhere in Cypress Hills or in other cemeteries.</p>
        <p>In 1998, a state judge ordered all the remains removed after engineers warned that the hill would eventually collapse as wood in the debris decomposed. The hill had already begun shifting, and many coffins removed by then had come out of the ground crumpled and waterlogged.</p>
        <p>Today, hundreds of the corpses have been reburied -- at the cemetery's expense if the families kept the bodies at Cypress Hills -- and the long process of removing the others continues.</p>
        <p>''Caskets are coming out crushed; bodies are coming out of caskets,'' Carmen A. Pacheco, a lawyer for nearly 200 families, said on Friday.  ''We feel they filed the bankruptcy petition as a shield to protect the corporation.''</p>
        <p>She questioned its validity, holding that the cemetery ''has substantial resources and has been making money'' from the continued sale of graves elsewhere in the cemetery.</p>
        <p>She and her associate Betty Lugo  also said court-appointed receivers who had run the cemetery in recent years and their lawyers had earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees from the cemetery's assets.</p>
        <p>The lawyer who filed the bankruptcy petition, Lester A. Lazarus, agreed that the bankruptcy action was intended to protect the 152-year-old cemetery, a not-for-profit corporation, but said it was necessary. ''We felt the potential loss from the various suits could be so great that it could make it impossible for them to  operate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The petition seeks a court-supervised reorganization of the cemetery under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws. If the request is granted, the plaintiffs will have to line up with other creditors for whatever payments the court awards, almost certainly much less than they are seeking. Ms. Pacheco and Ms. Lugo are seeking $12 million for their clients, and other plaintiffs are seeking millions more.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lazarus said, ''We're hoping that when people see the file and the assets of the cemetery, they'll be a little more realistic in what they are asking for in their claims.'' His  court papers list $9 million in cemetery assets and $2.4 million in liabilities, including $864,000 in estimated liabilities for the court-ordered disinterments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazarus said most of the $6.6 million in remaining assets was in  trust funds that he thinks may not be legally used for anything but perpetual care of graves.</p>
        <p>In another proceeding, the New York attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, is seeking to end the court receivership into which the cemetery was placed in 1994, after a former attorney general, Robert Abrams, accused the cemetery of mismanagement, citing the hill's construction and what he called financial improprieties. There has been no decision on the request to end the receivership.</p>
        <p>Scott Brown, a spokesman for Mr. Spitzer, said his office favored a new cemetery board elected by the lot owners, ''to return the cemetery to their control.''</p>
        <p>The receivership itself has been a source of trouble. Early this year, two Brooklyn lawyers complained, in a letter that became public, that they had been fired as legal advisers to the cemetery's receiver despite their ''unwavering loyalty'' to the Brooklyn Democratic Party. The letter led to a federal investigation into possible illegal patronage in court appointments. No charges have been brought so far.</p>
        <p>The burial hill, built when the board was running Cypress Hills, sought to create more plots and to appeal to the city's growing Chinese population, many of whose members prefer to be buried on high ground amid picturesque scenery, two requirements for auspicious feng shui, the Chinese art of balancing the unseen forces of landscape and people.</p>
        <p>Among the people closely following the cemetery's travails are a Florida couple, Barbara and Don Davis. Members of Mrs. Davis's family have been prominent in running the cemetery over the years, as board leaders, since her great-great- grandfather became involved shortly after Cypress Hills was established in 1848.</p>
        <p>The Davises said their family was the largest lot owner in Cypress Hills, with about 40 lots containing perhaps 700 burial plots. The couple, who also plan to be buried there, said they would serve on a new board if Mr. Spitzer's request was granted.</p>
        <p>''I never expected I'd be this involved in Cypress Hills before I died,'' Mrs. Davis said.</p>
