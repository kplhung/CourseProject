        <p>Out of the Fray, Onto the Sidelines</p>
        <p>From the time she ousted a 50-year incumbent to become a Democratic congresswoman in 1972 until she lost her race for a second term as New York City's comptroller in 1993, Elizabeth Holtzman was prominent in the city's political panorama.</p>
        <p>Committed and outspoken to her admirers, needlessly provocative in the minds of her critics, she went from being seen by many as a breath of fresh air and integrity to being assailed two decades later by those who questioned her integrity.</p>
        <p>Overall in her political career, Ms. Holtzman served eight years in the congressional seat she won from Emanuel Celler, eight as Brooklyn district attorney and four as comptroller, and lost two Senate races.</p>
        <p>After the 1992 Democratic Senate primary, in which she finished last in a four-way contest, many former supporters said her attacks on the second-place finisher, Geraldine A. Ferraro, kept Mrs. Ferraro from winning. In addition, the courts had agreed with findings, which Ms. Holtzman had contested, that she violated conflict-of-interest laws in taking a loan in that campaign.</p>
        <p>Ms. Holtzman has not run for office since her 1993 loss. Asked last week if this meant she would never run again, the 59-year-old lawyer said: ''Never is a very long time. But I've built an interesting practice and have a varied list of tasks on the agenda.'' Besides, she said, ''I've been in the political fray and I'm happy to be on the sidelines.''</p>
        <p>On television, she has urged Hillary Rodham Clinton's election to the Senate. And she testified before the House Judiciary Committee to oppose President Clinton's impeachment -- the same committee on which, in 1974, she voted to impeach Richard M. Nixon.</p>
        <p>Second thoughts about that 1992 Senate race? ''I think that's a long time in the past and there's no point in reliving campaigns,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Fighting With a Heart For a Pot of Gold</p>
        <p>When a gunman pumped two bullets into the head of Manuel de Dios Unanue in 1992, it seemed like a story out of Colombia: an antidrug journalist said to have been assassinated on the orders of leaders of the Cali cartel who were enraged by his exposes.</p>
        <p>But it was not in Colombia. It was at a restaurant in Elmhurst, Queens.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Dios, who was 48 and a former editor in chief of El Diario-La Prensa, New York City's leading Spanish-language daily, was publishing two Spanish-language magazines in which he castigated the cartel. Six people were convicted in his killing.</p>
        <p>Vicky Sanchez, who lived with Mr. de Dios in Queens and worked with him on the magazines, now lives in Puerto Rico with their daughter, Melody, 11. She has criticized the United States Justice Department for denying the contention of her lawyer, Donald M. Halperin, that the department has the authority to award some payment to the child from assets seized from the Cali cartel.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sanchez says she has not given up. ''He lost his life fighting the cartel,'' she said. ''I'm waiting for the next president, to write to him.''</p>
