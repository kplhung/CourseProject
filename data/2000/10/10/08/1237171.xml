        <p>In 1991 Jordan Pine was a dentist studying for his law degree. Now he is a lawyer who has developed a board game, Proverbial Wisdom, in which players draw sketches to illustrate famous sayings while others try to guess the sayings.</p>
        <p>He admits it's a strange occupational twist, but if he was able to combine two careers (he specializes in dental malpractice), why not a third?</p>
        <p>Mr. Pine, who lives in Valley Cottage, came up with the idea while walking in a snowstorm in 1994. He grabbed a napkin and made a sketch of a body with two heads, asking a friend to identify the proverb it represented. The friend correctly guessed, ''Two heads are better than one.''</p>
        <p>Five years later his board game went on the market, and the first printing of 10,000 copies sold out, mostly through catalogs and specialty stores.</p>
        <p>The game, a combination of Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary, sells for $29.95.</p>
