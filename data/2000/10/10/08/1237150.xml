        <p>FEW grins were brighter than Thomas H. Bailey's pearly-white wattage a year ago on the cover of Forbes magazine.</p>
        <p>Posing against a Rocky Mountain backdrop, Mr. Bailey, the founder and chief executive of Janus Capital in Denver, had little reason to fret. Janus was hauling in the largest net sales of any money manager in the mutual fund industry. Powered by huge bets on technology and telecommunications, its funds were topping the performance charts. ''The Janus Touch'' -- as the Forbes story was labeled -- was producing, in some cases, triple-digit annual returns.</p>
        <p>Fast-forward one year. Janus's favorite stocks, the likes of Nokia, Apple Computer and Microsoft, are stumbling. The company's highflying performance has been grounded. Critics say the firm has been bloated with more money than it can effectively manage -- the Janus Twenty fund, which once had about 20 stocks, should now be called the Janus Forty-Five. Not helping any were the recent retirement of James Craig, the firm's respected chief investment officer, and a feud with its corporate parent, Kansas City Southern, over how it would be spun off.</p>
        <p>Investors' doubts about Janus became evident in September, the first month in more than two and a half years that more money was removed from its funds than was put in.</p>
        <p>But where else should investors go? In today's manic markets, even a major fund company can fall from atop the charts to mediocrity in a matter of months. As a result, investors have rediscovered a degree of caution. According to AMG Data Services, which tracks fund flows, more than half the new money that they put into equity funds in the third quarter went into large-cap growth funds -- not exactly the most conservative haven, but safer than sector funds, especially in technology, where they were more prone to take a chance earlier in the year.</p>
        <p>A new collection of fund groups, meanwhile, has replaced Janus at the top, and their success suggests two strategies. Investors seeking some safety could choose a group like the Wasatch Funds of Salt Lake City. Its practice of value-oriented investing has kept it searching for unloved and undervalued companies and sectors.</p>
        <p>Samuel S. Stewart Jr., president of Wasatch and lead manager of its Wasatch Core Growth fund, said his success this year was a matter of patience. Last year, instead of buying Internet stocks, he bought small-  and medium-sized health and financial services companies he saw as undervalued. And his performance lagged behind market averages.</p>
        <p>THIS year, that strategy turned into a trifecta. Health and financial services are two of the  hottest sectors, and smaller-company stocks are outperforming large-company shares by the biggest margin since 1993.</p>
        <p>''It's tortoise and hare,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''What did the tortoise do different that put him in first place? Nothing. The hare sat down.''</p>
        <p>But some of the hares are still hopping. Granted, Internet stocks in general have yet to recover from the hammering they took in April. The average technology fund was down 1.7 percent in the third quarter, while telecommunications funds, technology's high-octane twin, were brutalized, falling 7.2 percent. Still, two of the top-performing fund families of the year -- the Van Wagoner Funds of San Francisco and the Turner Funds of Berwyn, Pa. -- lean heavily on technology and telecommunications, according to Morningstar Inc.</p>
        <p>Both groups are frenetic traders, and both have dumped the older technology champions in favor of the newest. ''There's a real changing of the guard in the technology business,'' said Garrett Van Wagoner, president of the Van Wagoner Funds.  ''The desktop companies -- Intel, Microsoft, Dell -- are becoming old-economy companies. The desktop isn't sexy anymore. Bill Gates is kind of an old fogy. He's 43 with a zillion dollars and kids.''</p>
        <p>The most pronounced move of the third quarter was a surge in value funds, which closed the gap with growth funds for the year.</p>
        <p>The technology boom of last year was ruled by growth investors, who look for companies with accelerating earnings, with less regard for price.  As a result, the Internet-shy strategy of Mr. Stewart at his flagship Wasatch Core Growth fund failed to  bring Janus-like returns. The fund, which Morningstar categorizes as a combination of growth and value investing, gained 19.3 percent last year, two percentage points behind the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.</p>
        <p>Through the first nine months this year, however, it is up 23.2 percent, compared with the 2.4 percent decline of the S.&amp; P.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Stewart said, he found growing companies selling at 10 to 15 times earnings, ''and that's an awfully attractive price.'' But to many people, he said, a company with steady 20 percent earnings growth was boring.</p>
        <p>''People said you could always come back to it, so they jumped from high quality to chase after Internet stocks,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Wasatch Core Growth fund, with $290 million in assets, had an especially strong third quarter, gaining more than 13.7 percent. Surges in some of its financial services holdings propelled it into the top 1 percent of small-company funds that blend value and growth styles, according to Morningstar. One top pick, and the fund's largest holding, was AmeriCredit, a Fort Worth-based lender to people with low credit ratings. Though subprime lending has become something of an investor untouchable, especially after First Union's shuttering of the Money Store earlier this year, Mr. Stewart said he believes AmeriCredit is simply a well-managed company in an out-of-favor industry. In the quarter,  the stock gained nearly 70 percent.</p>
        <p>''We haven't done a whole lot different this year than in previous years,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''Some years, the market is more generous to us.''</p>
        <p>Make that many years: Wasatch Core Growth ranks in the top 20 percent of its peer group for the last decade.</p>
        <p>Value investing, though, has certainly been no cure-all, given how much better growth funds, especially in technology, have done in previous years.</p>
        <p>''It's a little bit of a victory for the old economy,'' said John Rekenthaler, director of research at Morningstar. ''They need about 30 more quarters like this to make up for 1998 and 1999. It's like a team giving up four touchdowns to the St. Louis Rams and getting a few six-yard runs and a first down. No value managers should be crowing.''</p>
        <p>As the Van Wagoner and Turner groups show, some of the most successful funds continue to chase the sort of technology stocks that cause value investors to quiver. Mr. Van Wagoner and Robert E. Turner, the chief executive of Turner Funds, both rearrange their portfolios far more often than the average money manager, seeking stocks whose earnings and price gains have the greatest momentum. Mr. Turner said that turnover in his technology fund was about 1,000 percent a year.</p>
        <p>While such an approach has the potential to generate high tax bills, this year it has also given them high returns.</p>
        <p>''Momentum has been tricky, but it has worked for some people,'' Mr. Rekenthaler said. ''It's a matter of execution. It was a tough quarter to be a long-term buyer.''  FIVE or six years ago, most technology funds had similar casts: Microsoft, Intel, Compaq, I.B.M. But no longer. The breathtaking expansion of technology and telecommunications has made it harder to predict what one might find in such sector funds. It has also made it more difficult for professional and amateur investors alike to navigate the possibilities.</p>
        <p>''Last year was a lay-up for individual investors,'' said Mr. Turner, whose firm also runs the $599 million Vanguard Growth Equity fund and $49 million Mercury Select Growth, part of the Merrill Lynch family.  ''This year is more sobering, a wake-up call. It's also a wake-up call for the big investment funds. The buy-and-hold strategy doesn't work.''</p>
        <p>Buy and hold, that most venerated of investing dictums, does not work? Mr. Turner says many large growth funds that are fueled by technology have kept some of their prized holdings too long.</p>
        <p>''The really big blue-chip tech stocks have done horrible,'' he said.  ''There's new-economy tech stocks and there's old-economy tech stocks.'' He noted that personal computer companies saw earnings growth fall from 30 percent annually  five years ago to about 15 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Investors who avoided the largest computer-related stocks helped themselves during the third quarter. Intel's revenue was well below expectations. Dell's revenue growth rate slowed for the third consecutive quarter. And Apple warned that fourth-quarter earnings would be well short of expectations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner and Mr. Van Wagoner both contend that larger funds -- those with tens of billions of dollars in assets -- are caught in a trap. They say such funds have grown by leaning heavily on the largest technology companies, but now they find it difficult to switch, or to keep up with the market's sharp turns.</p>
        <p>''Volatility is huge,'' Mr. Turner said. ''The Nasdaq trades at 2 percent swings 50 percent of the time. Guys with hundreds of billions of dollars can't do it.''</p>
        <p>In other words, they cannot move their money around without causing stocks to jump or dive, or without tipping off competitors. ''You see their trades; their footprints are all over the place,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner said his firm had sold  many technology and telecommunications leaders, including Nokia, a Janus favorite.</p>
        <p>So what has he been buying? ''The common theme is that all companies need to buy servers, software and storage devices and create networks,'' he said, which is why he buys companies that provide those products and services.</p>
        <p>He likes Juniper Networks, the maker of network switches and routers that is an upstart competitor to Cisco Systems. But his investment in a stock can be quite fluid. He bought Juniper at its offering in June 1999. After a big run-up, he sold the Turner Technology fund's entire position in  March and reduced his other funds' holdings. Then, after Juniper fell  more than 50 percent during the technology pullback in the spring, he bought back in.</p>
        <p>Mr. Van Wagoner also favors providers of Internet services and expertise. ''Most of the companies are involved in Web-ifying the G.M.'s, bringing the big companies up to speed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His firm invested last year in Interwoven, a Silicon Valley builder of software for corporate Web sites, while it was still a private company. Interwoven went public last October at $17 a share, and the firm trimmed its position in February, when it was as high as $80.06. When he jumped back in, during April, it was in the $20-to-$30 range.</p>
        <p>For the record, investors should not count out Janus because of a disappointing year. Of the 14 equity funds that have existed since the beginning of the year, 8 have lost money. But the millions of investors who were with Janus at the beginning of last year still have excellent returns, and most appear to be giving its fund managers the benefit of the doubt, or at least more time to right the ship.</p>
        <p>FOR all the risks of the Janus investing strategy, its executives are not interested in becoming another Fidelity Investments, a full-service investment firm with a broad menu of offerings. They intend to stick with a relatively small collection of funds that aim to top the charts.</p>
        <p>Scott Schoelzel, manager of Janus Twenty, said that after several strong years, Janus's weaker performance this year should be no great surprise.</p>
        <p>''I expected this to be a tough year,'' he said. ''You had a fairly precipitous rise in rates by the Fed, a move in oil that surprised most people. Look at our funds over 3 years, 5 years, 10 years or 15 years. It's become fashionable to take shots at Janus.''</p>
        <p>With no false modesty, he compared Janus to another champion who goes through mild slumps only to come back mightier than ever.</p>
        <p>''We're Tiger Woods,'' he said.  ''We've gone six months without winning a tournament.''</p>
