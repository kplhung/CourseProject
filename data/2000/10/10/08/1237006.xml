        <p>With its plans for a new temple in Harrison, N.Y., the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints seems to have aimed too high -- more than 14 feet too high.</p>

        <p>With its plans for a new temple in Harrison, N.Y., the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints seems to have aimed too high -- more than 14 feet too high.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 28, by a vote of 5 to 2, the town Zoning Board of Appeals rejected the church's request for a variance that would have allowed it to exceed a 30-foot height limit on the 24-acre site it owns at Westchester Avenue and Kenilworth Road.</p>
        <p>The application was for a building 44.7 feet high, though this number was disputed by opponents in the neighborhood, who said that the 106-foot tower ought to be included (steeples are ordinarily unrestricted by height limits) and that the measurement ought to be made from the lowest part of the sloping building site.</p>
        <p>''We hope that the applicant will return with a plan that is more sensitive to the character of the neighborhood,'' said Jeffrey D. Grant of Grant, Weinhaus, lawyers for the local opponents.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the church, James Staudt of McCullough Goldberger &amp; Staudt, said no course of action would be set until the zoning decision was analyzed.</p>
        <p>The entire regulatory landscape may be changing, however, as a result of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, which exempts religious institutions from zoning rules that excessively burden religious exercise. It was signed into law by President Clinton six days before the Harrison decision.</p>
