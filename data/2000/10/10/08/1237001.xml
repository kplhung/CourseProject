        <p>SOME people covet their ancestral sterling silver, others dote on old rugs, medicine bottles or superannuated spittoons. But only a few people really appreciate horticultural antiques. The members of the Scarsdale Women's Club are among those people.</p>
        <p>The women of the 82-year-old organization not only use and maintain their century-and-a-half-old clubhouse, but each year in June they gather to celebrate the antique rhododendron that stands in front of it.  The shrub, a Rhododendron catawbiense hyrid, stands 15 feet tall and has a circumference of 35 feet. It has been growing on club property for well over a century, and most likely dates back to the era of William Bailey Lang, a wealthy mid-19th century iron merchant, whose estate is now home to the women's club.</p>
        <p>Evidently Lang was also a lover of old trees. When he created his 300-acre estate in 1858, he chose to keep an existing white oak (Quercus alba) that was already three centuries old.  The oak stands today directly in front of the entrance to Lang's home, which is now the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>According to Michael Marks, arborist for Cornell Cooperative Extension as well as a local tree service, the oak was shortened by topping years ago, so it stands only about 60 feet tall, with a trunk circumference between 50 and 60 feet. Another white oak on the rear corner of the property is a relative youngster -- 250 years old -- by comparison. Never subjected to topping, it stands 90 to 100 feet tall.</p>
        <p>Every June, when club members celebrate their special rhododendron in all its purple-flowered glory, they are also celebrating Lang and the wealthy 19th century Americans like him who preserved fine old specimens and sought out exotic new ones to beautify their properties.  ''Propertied people were proud of their rhododendrons and sent to England and China for new varieties as a way of showing their cultivated tastes,'' said Jane Benichek, club member, author and garden authority.</p>
        <p>In addition to the rhododendron, Lang also planted a handful of flowering crab apple trees (Malus) by the road that passes in front of the property; two of those trees survive and in the fall, birds still compete for the small red fruits.</p>
        <p>Lang may also have planted several flourishing Hop Hornbeams (Ostrya), a variety of tree with wood so hard that it long ago earned the nickname ''Ironwood Tree.'' A surviving London Plane tree, related to the American Sycamore, probably also dates back to the Lang era.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marks said that the survival of the celebrated rhododendron and the other ancient trees on the estate is ''unusual,'' given the vagaries of weather, construction, salt damage and inadequate pruning over the years. The rhododendron is particularly noteworthy, since it has lived almost twice as long as the 50 to 75 years that are normally allotted to members of the genus.</p>
        <p>Some of the other venerable trees on the women's club property are also a testament to long abandoned horticultural practices. Topping, like that done to the grand white oak, is no longer recommended by most arborists. When one of the century old tulip trees (Liriodendron) developed a cavity in its trunk many decades ago, the opening was filled and sealed with mortared bricks to keep out both insects and the elements.  Years later, the bricks are still visible and the tree still stands.</p>
        <p>The women's club bought the Lang property in 1927, and, according to club records, part of the reason for doing so was the members' appreciation of ''the lovely trees of great age.''</p>
        <p>Genevieve Johnson, publicity chairwoman for the club, noted that there are two trees on the grounds from approximately 1550, and 15 trees that are more than 100 years old, including 10 dating from the William Bailey Lang era or before.</p>
        <p>While time has been kind to many of the trees on the property, it has taken its toll on the estate itself.  What was once a country property, is now surrounded by houses, its total area shrunk from hundreds of acres to four. A map of the trees on the property has recently been updated and an inventory prepared by the women of the club. Mr. Marks has contributed his suggestions for ongoing maintenance and a few necessary removals.</p>
        <p>He has assured the members that with a modicum of care, their celebrated rhododendron, the commanding maple tree and most of the other green antiques that define the property should survive well into the twenty-first century.</p>
        <p>CLIPPINGS  And, on Your Right, 250-Year-Old Shade</p>
        <p>The Scarsdale Women's Club is in the process of formulating a plan for the ongoing maintenance of its collection of antique trees. In addition to its spring rhododendron celebration, the club will be holding a fall tour this year on Oct. 22 at 2 p.m., on the property at 37 Drake Road in Scarsdale. The public is invited for this event, which will be free.</p>
        <p>William Bailey Lang, his wife and a host of other local notables are buried in the parklike cemetery adjacent to the nearby St. James Church at 10 Church Lane. The church is sponsoring a free Halloween walk in the cemetery on Oct. 29 from 5 to 7 p.m.</p>
        <p>For further information about the women's club event, call (914) 723-0024. For further information about the cemetery walk, call St. James Church at (914) 723-6100.</p>
