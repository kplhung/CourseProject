        <p>Abdul Muhammad smiles when he recalls the days when the milkman delivered fresh milk and eggs to everybody's front stoop in the morning.</p>
        <p>He makes a living in a similar way, hauling sacks of frozen fish he buys wholesale from the Nation of Islam into private homes. But he has to wait until the light of day to make his rounds. Today, he says, crime makes predawn deliveries impossible.</p>
        <p>''I believe that some day in the future it will be possible again,'' he said. ''According to the Scriptures, Jesus and God shall perfect every human being and they shall live with us on earth.'' The Bible, he said, ''predicted hundreds of things, so you've got to believe that time will come.''</p>
        <p>Until it does, Muhammad, the only name he goes by, will navigate his makeshift pushcart along Bedford-Stuyvesant's bumpy sidewalks or anywhere else in Brooklyn without charging extra for the delivery.</p>
        <p>One recent day he took the subway from his home in Crown Heights to the Utica Avenue stop and, eight blocks away, lugged the catch of the week up the stairs for his first delivery.</p>
        <p>He guided a red and white Igloo cooler, clamped to a luggage cart, past the coin laundry on Utica and exchanged pleasantries with a woman there. He handed her a flier for Muhammad's Door to Door from a clear plastic pocket on the side of the cooler. ''Have a blessed day,'' she told him.</p>
        <p>At a gray building with a giant sign that reads ''Attention Police: Arrest Any Person Loitering at This Building. Landlord Will Prosecute,'' he pushed his cart up the wheelchair ramp, through a broken iron door and into the elevator. The flier offered six frozen salmon, king or bluefish steaks, six whole flounder or red snapper or eight pieces of porgy for $10 to $15.</p>
        <p>His best deal, however, was the 18 cleaned and scaled whitings for $10 a bag.</p>
        <p>''These are not like Atlantic whitings,'' he said. ''Atlantic whiting are like this.'' He held out his right hand loosely, evoking a small, defrosted fish. ''We sell Pacific whiting,'' he said, stretching open his palms and holding them a foot apart. ''They're much bigger. And fish from blue water tastes more delicious than fish from gray water.''</p>
        <p>Inside a fourth-floor apartment, Muhammad's first customer took two bags of thick, meaty, boneless whiting filets -- he likes them fried or baked, with a little garlic salt or garlic powder -- and handed Muhammad a crumpled $20 bill.</p>
        <p>Like most of Muhammad's 25 regular customers and about that many occasional ones, they met while Muhammad was passing out fliers and selling the Nation of Islam's newspaper, Final Call. ''It opens lots of doors,'' he said.</p>
