        <p>A VERY fit-looking man of medium build answered the door of a modern town house in the East 60's. Friends say he barely resembles the person he used to be, a guy with hair out to there, and a lot more bulk.</p>
        <p>It was almost embarrassing to ask what had happened to the old Donny Deutsch, but he didn't seem to mind. Over coffee in his backyard, just inches from some pastries provided by his personal assistant, pastries that he didn't seem to notice, he talked about the way he was five years ago. ''I had put on a lot of weight,'' he said. ''I was working hard. I was going through a divorce.''</p>

        <p>A VERY fit-looking man of medium build answered the door of a modern town house in the East 60's. Friends say he barely resembles the person he used to be, a guy with hair out to there, and a lot more bulk.</p>
        <p>It was almost embarrassing to ask what had happened to the old Donny Deutsch, but he didn't seem to mind. Over coffee in his backyard, just inches from some pastries provided by his personal assistant, pastries that he didn't seem to notice, he talked about the way he was five years ago. ''I had put on a lot of weight,'' he said. ''I was working hard. I was going through a divorce.''</p>
        <p>He reacted by remaking himself. He started running, and eating more carefully. A lot of people seem to lose their will after some initial success, but his will intensified.</p>
        <p>He began exercising with a personal trainer a few days a week. And recently, when the trainer, Michael Givens, decided to leave the gym where they were meeting, Mr. Deutsch figured the time was right to do away with the second bedroom in the apartment he rents in the town house, and turn it into a gym.</p>
        <p>Following his trainer's recommendations, he furnished the room with a  universal gym from King, called a Super Smith; a treadmill from Schwinn; a StairMaster; and lots of free weights and dumbbells, for a total cost of about $20,000. The gym is a major presence, and it's hard to ''forget'' to exercise. ''It's not just a treadmill with some clothes hanging over it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His new habits seem so ingrained that slacking off doesn't appear to be a problem. The guaranteed connection between effort and results keeps him going. Since he started exercising five years ago, he said, he has lost 40 pounds. Exercise, he said, is ''the one thing you can have complete control over.''</p>
        <p>These days, Mr. Deutsch, 42, an advertising executive, runs three days a week, for five or six miles each time, and meets three mornings a week in his new gym with the trainer. ''It takes about an hour, going full steam,'' he said of the training session. At the end, ''I'm just wiped out.'' On the other days, he works out solo, in front of a wall of mirrors, blasting music or watching sports channels on television.</p>
        <p>Despite his grueling schedule of workouts, ''I'm not one of those nuts,'' he said, looking to his fiancee, Stacy Josloff, for confirmation. She doesn't exactly agree. ''He's gotten way into it,'' said Ms. Josloff, who works as a sales executive for the apparel company Max Mara. She and Mr. Deutsch, who plan to marry next June, have been looking for a town house to buy on the Upper East Side, where they say even the fixer-uppers they have seen are going for at least $8 million.</p>
        <p>WHEN they move, they'll be able to take the gym with them. But even people without town houses can have gyms at home. Mr. Givens, the trainer, said he meets many clients in typically modest-sized New York apartments. ''I'm not a big machine user,'' he said. ''Machines allow you to do less work.''</p>
        <p>Women, he said, can get the dumbbells and free weights they need for $500. Men may need to pay a bit more for heavier equipment. He invested in machinery for Mr. Deutsch's gym because the space was there; having a variety of machines, he said, sometimes helps people fight boredom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deutsch's gym isn't luxurious, but it is decorated. On one wall stand some antique gym lockers, bought at ABC Carpet &amp; Home. On another are signed photographs of Muhammad Ali and Joe DiMaggio. He has a football, too, signed by Joe Namath. ''He's my favorite athlete of all time,'' Mr. Deutsch said.</p>
        <p>He usually works out in the morning, arriving at his office, Deutsch Advertising, at about 9:30. In the early 1980's, he joined the business that had been started in 1969 by his father, David, who is now retired. He has built it into an agency with 1,000 employees and $1.5 billion in billings, for clients like Mitsubishi, Ikea, Snapple, Cartier and Domino's Pizza. ''I have only one gift,'' he said. ''Finding people who are smarter than me.''</p>
        <p>After his workout, before heading for his office, he indulges in his morning ritual of breakfast at a local coffee shop, where he has scrambled egg whites and whole wheat toast, dry.</p>
        <p>Exercising, he said, makes it a lot easier to eat well. ''You've just killed yourself,'' he said, ''and you're not going to eat bacon and eggs.''</p>
