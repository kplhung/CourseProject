        <p>IN his heart of hearts, C. Michael Armstrong, the chairman and chief executive of AT&amp;T, still probably wants folks to phone home. But if he has his way, they will do so on someone else's network.</p>
        <p>Last week, Ma Bell said that it was considering various ways to get rid of its consumer long-distance business, through a sale to another carrier or a spinoff to shareholders.</p>
        <p>Either way, it will not be an easy sell: AT&amp;T's consumer long distance is starting to dwindle, and the erosion is likely to accelerate. As a bonus, AT&amp;T will very likely try to pass on a chunk of its $56 billion in long-term debt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Armstrong, who spent $100 billion to pile-drive AT&amp;T into the cable business, needs to do something: the company's shares are down more than 40 percent so far this year. Adrian G. Davies, a telecommunications analyst at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh, took some time last week to talk about Mr. Armstrong's options. Following are excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. AT&amp;T's consumer long-distance business will have revenues of about $20 billion this year. Why will a business that big shrink?</p>
        <p>A. At the moment, AT&amp;T is relying on its wonderful brand name and the fact that people are reluctant to switch carriers. The business has been a cash cow, and they have been milking it and even raising rates.</p>
        <p>But the fundamentals in the consumer business look bad, because revenue is declining at an accelerating rate. The major reason for that is the entry of the regional Bell operating companies into the business. These companies are forecasting they will get 30 percent of the consumer long-distance market. But it could easily be 40 percent to 50 percent. And people are saying a disproportionate amount of that share is coming out of AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>Q. The consumer long-distance business generates about $8 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. Can AT&amp;T service its debt without that cash?</p>
        <p>A. The earnings power of the cable companies is maybe only 15 percent of the whole company, so there is much more exposure to long distance than anything else. The business long-distance business, which AT&amp;T will keep, will generate about $30 billion in revenue this year and about $10 billion Ebitda.</p>
        <p>But a potential buyer would not only buy the business, but would also assume some of the debt. And it is unclear whether or not they can find a buyer. Verizon seems to have turned up their noses at it.</p>
        <p>Q. Aside from the regional Bells, are there any other logical potential buyers?</p>
        <p>A. One option is selling the consumer long-distance business to a consortium of cable companies.</p>
        <p>They are just getting into the long-distance business, and it could provide them with a platform. But cable companies have been difficult for AT&amp;T to negotiate with, and they are unlikely to do it unless it is extremely profitable for them.</p>
        <p>Q. Assuming that he doesn't find a buyer willing to pay an attractive price, what other avenues does Mr. Armstrong have?</p>
        <p>A. I think he will either go for a tracking stock or an outright spinout of the consumer business. The trick will be trying to make the spinoff look attractive.</p>
        <p>At the moment, AT&amp;T has a relatively high dividend and a high retail shareholder base. That restricts some of their movement.</p>
        <p>But they could cut the dividend to shareholders of the parent company and offer to switch them into shares of the consumer long-distance company, which would have a high dividend of its own.</p>
        <p>Whether or not the retail base would buy it would depend on what the terms of the offer for the consumer business might be.</p>
        <p>Q. Given its prospects, what sort of yield do you think it would take to attract investors to a stand-alone consumer long-distance company?</p>
        <p>A. Well, at one point the yield on Philip Morris stock was around 10 percent. It would take a 10 percent to 15 percent yield to make it attractive.</p>
        <p>Q. Why does AT&amp;T need to do something now? If the company wants to unload some of its debt on the consumer long-distance business, why not pay more of it down now and sell the business in a year or so?</p>
        <p>A. The problem with waiting is that the regional Bells are getting into long distance. Verizon got in late last year, SBC got in in late June, and more states are on the way.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T may have a strategy to deal with competition in one or two states. But dealing with competition in all 50 will be another ballgame. They need to do something fast.</p>
        <p>Q. Federated owns AT&amp;T stock, despite all the challenges that face the company and despite its miserable performance so far this year. Why is that?</p>
        <p>A. We do own shares in some of our funds, but we are underweight the stock relative to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.</p>
        <p>The reason we own it is that it is trading at a discount to some of its parts. Mr. Armstrong could conceivably break some of it up and generate shareholder value.</p>
        <p>Buying another company is not the way out. The repercussion of having purchased two cable companies is that the board might be a little less tolerant of buying something else, because the debt restricts them somewhat.</p>
        <p>The other option that has been talked about is to merge business long distance with British Telecom, another company with tremendous debt. So I don't see that as a viable option either.</p>
