        <p>Decorating is a nonverbal system of communication. Think empirical beeper. Something 60's -- this Roy Lichtenstein poster, for instance -- inspires texture, pattern and irony, which are three of the most important ingredients in decorating. The colors also work well in a room.</p>
        <p>It's all about bramble and pastiche. The arrangement I'm holding by David Browne goes somewhere, I'm sure. Circles are the new squares in decorating; hence this plastic hanging globe lamp by Pol's Potten.</p>

        <p>Decorating is a nonverbal system of communication. Think empirical beeper. Something 60's -- this Roy Lichtenstein poster, for instance -- inspires texture, pattern and irony, which are three of the most important ingredients in decorating. The colors also work well in a room.</p>
        <p>It's all about bramble and pastiche. The arrangement I'm holding by David Browne goes somewhere, I'm sure. Circles are the new squares in decorating; hence this plastic hanging globe lamp by Pol's Potten.</p>
        <p>Unique objects by Philip Crangi -- j'adore the ironic mystery of not knowing what they are exactly -- help create a shrine to the fashion designer Tom Ford. He's the dream client, a veritable fountainhead of commissions, a style setter who knows where the trends are buried, a man with more than one house to decorate. Minimalism c'est mort. Slither is everywhere today. A snakeskin console makes the room this season.</p>
        <p>Someone once said that clothes are ''the furniture of the mind made visible.'' Here I am in Gucci mufti splendor -- fur pants are hot this season -- and Prada shoes. It's not that I'm exclusively label conscious; I just think it is key to follow certain central beams. Anyone with an interest in interior design and architecture appreciates central beams.</p>
        <p>How can decorators afford to live like this? Modern strategies, aka markups. Be selfish: don't just ask what you can do for a room; ask what a room can do for you. This blue glass sculpture by Edvin Ohrstrom enhances our blue eyes.</p>
        <p>Doctors have Band-Aids and Botox; we have zebra- and jaguar-print Clarence House fabric.</p>
        <p>Other important ingredients of decorating are white paint, off-the-books help and piles of magazines and books. Reading material includes such seminal tomes as Graeme Aitken's ''Fifty Ways of Saying Fabulous'' and Le Mot Juste, a dictionary of classical and foreign words and phrases, including the correct spellings for ''zeitgeist,'' ''tchotchke'' and ''corps de ballet.'' Displaying choice design magazines -- including Nest, Wallpaper, The World of Interiors and Muscle &amp; Fitness (whoops!) -- shows that one subscribes to a sense of interior belonging and community.</p>
        <p>Little dogs are so last season. Alsatians are the new Jack Russells. I recycled my Jack Russell, Bundt, to a friend's place in Millbrook and then got Ace. The fashion designer Nicolas Ghesquiere knitted Alsatian heads onto sweaters for his fall 2000 collection for Balenciaga. (It's all about alpha dogs on tops this season.) Of course, growing up not that far really from Grosse Pointe, we called Alsatians German shepherds, but that was before anyone knew Nicolas Ghesquiere.</p>
        <p>Fun, like this ''fun'' sable blanket, covers a multitude in decorating. This lesson I learned from my great-aunt Elsie. I'll never forget the night I dreamed she breezed into our house and declared, ''If you are tired of your pine farm furniture, paint it white, picked out with gold, and with red satin ribbons tie little cushions of leopard plush on chair seats.''</p>
