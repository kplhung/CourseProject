        <p>NESTLED between the factories and forklifts on Westmoreland Avenue here is a small office building with a small sheet of paper on its front door bearing the name E&amp;G Communications.</p>
        <p>Inside those doors one weekday morning, about 8, a peppy dance tune thumps down the hall from E&amp;G's barely furnished office. Inside, it looks like a party. Roughly 50 people in their late teens and early 20's are milling about and mingling.</p>
        <p>Many wear trendy haircuts and suits that probably should have stayed on the discount rack. The boom box on the floor is suddenly shut off when a somewhat older guy wearing a somewhat nicer suit enters. The group snaps to attention.</p>
        <p>''Hey, guys,'' he yells.</p>
        <p>''Hey, what?'' they yell back. The exchange is repeated like an Army drill and then morphs into a group song reminiscent of a frat party. In a cheering frenzy the group forms a circle and calls for its leader.</p>
        <p>And heeere's Ed Roderick.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roderick, the owner of the company, jogs into the room and around the the circle, high-fiving everyone like a star player announced at a playoff basketball game.</p>
        <p>But this is no game. It is the daily rah-rah session at E&amp;G Communications Group, a sales company that opened in early 1999. Sales representatives for E&amp;G, whose clients include AT&amp;T, visit offices to sell discount phone service.</p>
        <p>Most of E&amp;G's employees are from Westchester. They travel in groups to different commercial districts in the region to sell door to door. Most have worked here only a few months, the veterans almost a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roderick, 24, cuts off the cheering with a short wave of his hand. He stares at his clipboard thoughtfully to let the silence sink in and then begins to laud a handful of productive employees, singling out one who has been racking up sales lately.</p>
        <p>''He's rockin', he's rollin', he's ringin' the bell,'' Mr. Roderick says. ''He's makin' 150 bucks a day. Let's hear it for him.''</p>
        <p>The group cheers with barking sounds.</p>
        <p>To motivate employees, Mr. Roderick offers different incentives, like New York Giants tickets. Then he recites a Vince Lombardi quote about being totally devoted to your life's work. More dog whoops.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roderick's football metaphors are particularly effective, perhaps because he is a husky young man with a buzz cut carrying a clipboard, resembling an old-time coach giving a locker-room pep talk at half time.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Roderick's speech, there is an impact session each morning to motivate the group. This day's session was given by Greg Brownstein, an 18-year-old whose rise to assistant manager in only six months is already legendary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brownstein has done well. He takes the bus here each morning, but he is wearing a sharp suit the color of snap peas. He lectures the group about one of the company's staple mantras for success: Act As If.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brownstein scrawled the words on the blackboard and explained the swagger philosophy to the rookies: even if you haven't made it, appear as if you have. Most people will believe it.</p>
        <p>''When I first started working here, I had two shirts and a pair of Dockers,'' he said. ''I didn't even own a suit. Now I have four new suits. I acted as if.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brownstein attributed his success to his mastery of the Fives and the Eights, the company's steps to successful selling, listed on large placards on the wall.</p>
        <p>The Fives are the Five Steps to a Sale. The first step is SEE (Smile, Eye contact and Enthusiasm). The next step is Short Story, or KISS (Keep It Short and Simple.).</p>
        <p>As for the Eights, or the Eight Steps to Success, No. 6 is typical: ''Don't lose your attitude: each 'no' brings you closer to 'yes.' '' Other mantras on the walls include the ABC's of sales, ''Always Be Closing,'' which Alec Baldwin's character uses in his cutthroat motivational sales speech in the film ''Glengarry Glen Ross.''</p>
        <p>As a drill, the employees form a circle. A piece of paper is crumpled and thrown from one person to another. Each must catch it and give a quick sales pitch.</p>
        <p>Most rattle off a few glib sentences to an imaginary customer on how much they can save them on their phone bills. They are cheered. The rookies stumble through their lines, sometimes even on the name of the phone service. They are jeered.</p>
        <p>Carleen Calypso, 30, from Spring Valley, has been with the company for 11 months. She is a college graduate and was a social worker for years. She quit the profession because it made her ''depressed and tired.'' But the job taught her great skills of ''sympathy and empathy,'' which help her when selling to older customers, she said.</p>
        <p>As employees broke off into pairs to practice their sales technique, Ms. Calypso helped them polish their pitches.</p>
        <p>''Ma'am, I'm here to lower your rates,'' one employee said to another. ''Do you have a copy of your phone bill? What? 13 cents a minute? I can lower your rates 30 to 40 percent. Now if you'll just give me your driver's license and business card I can sign you up.''</p>
        <p>Here Ms. Calypso interrupted and suggested saying, ''Let me get'' not ''Give me'' -- your driver's license. ''It's less threatening,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Joshua Conde, 19, from Tappan has been at E&amp;G three months and is already a team leader. He quit college for a sales job for ''direction in my life.''</p>
        <p>Now he is studying another version of the three R's: Read, Relate, Relax, a strategy that E&amp;G uses to build intimacy with clients. He will talk sports, weather or current events with a client, anything to get them talking and receptive to a sales pitch.</p>
        <p>''When I first started, I looked like a working-class salesman,'' he explained, ''but when they see a 19-year-old guy in a $400 suit -- I mean I didn't pay 400 for it -- you start to build a trust factor.''</p>
        <p>The goal at E&amp;G is to move up through the four employee phases: distributor, leader, assistant manager and owner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roderick, whose company is affiliated with a larger company based in Chicago, said employees are told that within months they can manage one of the six other branches he owns and make up to $80,000 a year. Eventually, they will be ready to set up their own office.</p>
        <p>He said that distributors make weekly salaries of $300. A leader supervising a sales group makes $600 and assistant managers overseeing several groups make $1,500.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roderick grew up in Mystic, Conn. He wrestled in college and took civil engineering. He said that his parents were upset when they learned he was going to try his luck at door-to-door sales.</p>
        <p>''My parents were critical at first,'' he said, ''but now my mom wants a Lexus.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roderick said he has 60 workers, but there is a high turnover. He is constantly interviewing new candidates.</p>
        <p>The most promising, he said, are those who want the Five F's: fame, future, freedom, family and fortune, but not in that order. ''If they're not cut out for this, you can tell pretty quick,'' he said. ''And I'll tell them pretty quick.''</p>
        <p>He lives in New Rochelle and catches a ride to the office with his roommate, who works for him. He said that he earns more than $100,000 a year and that he is moving to Bronxville and buying a BMW.</p>
        <p>He picked up the ''Act As If'' slogan from ''Boiler Room,'' the 1999 film about a Long Island firm of young stock broker swindlers. It's the main rule of thumb in this business.</p>
        <p>''Hey, you walk like a million bucks, people will treat you like a million bucks.''</p>
