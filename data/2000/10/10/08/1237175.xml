        <p>The first presidential debate of campaign 2000 was testy and confusing. The meeting between the vice-presidential contenders was somber and informative. Now those debates are over, we can see the broad outlines of the political drama that will play out over the next four weeks. Voters will be trying to figure out whether the Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, is knowledgeable enough to be president, and whether the Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore, is likable enough. To observe the personal nature of the choice between the candidates is not to denigrate the important role of issues like taxes, Social Security, health, education and defense. But anyone listening to the campaign dialogue on talk shows and at dinner tables has to be struck by the degree to which politically engaged people are focusing on the candidates' contrasting capabilities and personality traits.</p>
        <p>Both candidates' knowledge about government and their individual psychologies have figured in making taxes a central issue of the campaign. Mr. Bush, for example, clings almost self-destructively to his tax cut of at least $1.3 trillion over 10 years, even though it allows Mr. Gore to attack the plan as absurdly weighted toward the wealthiest Americans. The governor may have needed to propose the tax cut to win conservatives' votes in the Republican primaries, but the issue has turned into an albatross this fall. If he can win on an issue so strongly identified with President George Bush, however, he will have vindicated the family honor. Moreover, if he can really deliver on tax cuts once in office, the younger Bush will have succeeded where his father failed. All politics may be local. But in this dynastic contest, it is hereditary as well. As often noted, Mr. Gore's warnings about tax breaks for the richest Americans hark back to the New Deal populism of his father, Albert Gore Sr.</p>

        <p>Both candidates' knowledge about government and their individual psychologies have figured in making taxes a central issue of the campaign. Mr. Bush, for example, clings almost self-destructively to his tax cut of at least $1.3 trillion over 10 years, even though it allows Mr. Gore to attack the plan as absurdly weighted toward the wealthiest Americans. The governor may have needed to propose the tax cut to win conservatives' votes in the Republican primaries, but the issue has turned into an albatross this fall. If he can win on an issue so strongly identified with President George Bush, however, he will have vindicated the family honor. Moreover, if he can really deliver on tax cuts once in office, the younger Bush will have succeeded where his father failed. All politics may be local. But in this dynastic contest, it is hereditary as well. As often noted, Mr. Gore's warnings about tax breaks for the richest Americans hark back to the New Deal populism of his father, Albert Gore Sr.</p>
        <p>Speaking of father figures, how about those vice-presidential candidates. For the first time since his selection for the Republican ticket, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney looked like an asset on Thursday night. Mr. Cheney's solid debate performance and his ability to talk about subjects that make Mr. Bush look tongue-tied carries the risk of diminishing the man at the top of the ticket. Even so, Mr. Cheney's steadiness may also pull in voters who find Mr. Bush attractive but are worried that he is too callow to be chief executive. Joseph Lieberman, for his part, showed mature judgment in letting Mr. Cheney make his points without feeling compelled to imitate Mr. Gore's combative debating style.</p>
        <p>But the No. 2's have had their day. In the upcoming debates, it will be purely up to Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore to close the sale. The vice president probably remains the best-informed candidate running in the United States this year for any office. But with his new nonverbal vocabulary of sighs, grimaces and interruptions, he has managed to turn  that asset into an irritation and thereby flatten his lead in the polls. Even some supporters wondered whether his performance might foretell difficulties as president in drawing Americans to his side in moments of decision and crisis.</p>
        <p>Luckily for the Democrats, while Mr. Gore was squirming as if he were trying to attract the teacher's attention, Mr. Bush was struggling with the exam questions.</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Bush showed last Tuesday that he can avoid defeating himself with gaffes and factual blunders. But in the second and third debates, he will have to show that he can move beyond repetitive accusations of ''fuzzy math'' and smoothly expound authoritative numbers of his own. As our colleague William Safire observed, Mr. Bush at some point has to win by winning, especially since he wants to persuade the American people to change course at a time of extraordinary prosperity.</p>
        <p>On balance, Mr. Bush had a lucky week. Mr. Gore made mistakes on a few trivial matters, masking Mr. Bush's shaky grasp of the cost of his tax cut, his Social Security proposal and his own campaign. He may not be so fortunate on Wednesday night. It will be hard to get by on generalities about big government if Mr. Gore can draw him into a detailed and sigh-free discussion of budgetary and foreign policy issues.</p>
