        <p>IN late February, over 500 people crowded into a downtown Huntington theater to spend the next four days discussing community development issues. This was neither a dry academic forum nor a boisterous antidevelopment rally.</p>
        <p>What this was, was a charrette.</p>
        <p>Charrette was a highfalutin French major's word as recently as January, but plenty of Huntingtonians nowadays can define the term, as if it were just another Gallic word like croissant or cafe or cul-de-sac. The word has entered the vocabulary not only of civic-minded residents of Huntington, an increasingly congested North Shore community, but also of a growing number of Long Island developers, architects, builders, zoning officials and environmentalists.</p>
        <p>The term is a key concept of the fast-rising community planning movement known as Smart Growth and refers to a public forum bringing together developer and civic advocate, politician and Main Street merchant, good-government blueblood and church-sisterhood stalwart. A charrette airs community grievances before they erupt into demonstrations and political gamesmanship. Before they find themselves screaming at hard hats, neighborhood naysayers get to influence architects. The intended result: what Smart Growth calls community buy-in, which seems to be something between co-option and cooperation.</p>
        <p>''In February, charrette was a word few people had heard,'' said Ron Stein, the president of Vision Huntington. ''But now, I think the word is known and understood among people who care at all about what's going on in the community.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stein's group is a nonprofit organization focused on bringing Smart Growth to Huntington. Its sister organization, Sustainable Long Island, extends that mission throughout Nassau and Suffolk.</p>
        <p>Dan Burden, an author and Smart Growth expert, was hired to moderate the charrette. A surge of antagonistic comments greeted his welcoming remarks. Finally, Mr. Burden announced he would tolerate no more negative wisecracks. That changed the tone, Alice Snodgrass, an event organizer, recalled, and people began to cooperate.</p>
        <p>Charrette was not the only new word introduced that frigid weekend. Terms like ''traffic calming,'' ''walkability, ''desirable  high-density and mixed use'' were also bandied about.</p>
        <p>The Smart Growth movement is pro-pedestrian, pro-environment and anti-sprawl. It promotes expanding the definition of affordable housing to include young professionals and entry-level workers, innovative uses of mass transit and new forms of communal automobile ownership.</p>
        <p>On Long Island, Smart Growth's ground zero is the Gerard Street office that Mr. Stein shares with Sustainable Long Island.  Both groups worked all spring and summer on post-charrette momentum. They needed a project that would meet their definition of feasibility, yet would be close to downtown.  Gerard Street, they agreed, would be  peachy.</p>
        <p>Broad, winding, highly trafficked Gerard,  they argued, would demonstrate just how Smart Growth could work. The post office, the municipal parking lot, a movie theater and a busy stretch of small shops are all on Gerard. Its two lanes narrow problematically into one as the street intersects with New York Avenue in the heart of downtown. Many pedestrians see it as a nightmare; motorists don't like it much, either.</p>
        <p>The Town of Huntington has approved Phase 1 of the Gerard Street improvement project, which will narrow the street, add a bike lane and calm traffic with raised intersections and a traffic circle.</p>
        <p>But parking is still a big problem. Smart Growth advocates proposed adding spaces to the municipal lot, but some existing spaces would have been temporarily lost during construction. They also thought they could reduce congestion quickly and cheaply by appealing to merchants to park their cars in the municipal lot, not in front of their stores. Shoppers could then park in those spaces.</p>
        <p>Whoops.</p>
        <p>Any local merchant could have seen the response coming. But Mr. Stein, an independent financial planner, apparently did not. Neither did Amy Hagedorn, a philanthropist and retired schoolteacher who is Sustainable Long Island's president, or the Rev. Patrick Duggan, Sustainable Long Island's executive director.</p>
        <p>What happened was this: The president of the downtown Business Improvement District, a popular and influential saloonkeeper named Billy Hoest fired off a letter to the political newcomers. The letter demanded that no parking be eliminated, even temporarily.</p>
        <p>The BID's reaction didn't surprise Huntington Chamber of Commerce's president, Dennis Sneden, who said he had suspected all along the merchants felt excluded, charrette or no charrette. ''A parking space downtown,'' he pointed out, ''accounts for approximately $100,000 a year in shopping.  Spaces cannot just disappear.''</p>
        <p>Simply finding out how many parking spaces exist downtown calls for Solomonic wisdom and Socratic questioning. The exact number has taken on mythic proportions in Huntington. ''I could tell you the number if I checked my files,'' Mr. Stein said.</p>
        <p>''But it would take me about three weeks,'' he added quickly, showing how political even Smart Growth can be.</p>
        <p>The fuss was smoothed over, and ground will be broken for the Gerard Street project in late winter or early spring, Mr. Stein said. Vision Huntington and Sustainable Long Island have raised $200,000 so far, all of it from the town. They acknowledge another that $500,000 is needed, and that figure would have been even higher, except that most of the design and professional work has been volunteered.</p>
        <p>The two organizations have made some influential new allies from across the political spectrum in the last seven months. One is Neal Lewis, an organizer of community organizers. His Neighborhood Network unites the folks who arrange the antidevelopment demonstrations that pop up whenever a major project is announced.</p>
        <p>Another, Bert Donnelly, is the executive director of the Garden City Chamber of Commerce, hardly a hotbed of populist community planners.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Lewis and Mr. Donnelly joined Mr. Stein and Mr. Duggan for several meetings with an influential group whose number included Morton Certilman, the chairman of the group charged with reviving Nassau County's stalled efforts to create a commercial, cultural and retail hub around a privatized Nassau Coliseum.</p>
        <p>That Mr. Certilman is even discussing a role for Smart Growth in this multibillion dollar project suggests that this national movement is indeed making local inroads.</p>
        <p>But this is still Long Island. ''We're still doing things the old way, according to the old rules,'' said Peter Klein, a partner in Klein &amp; Eversoll, a major residential builder in Commack. ''Obviously, developers have to make changes in the way we build Long Island. Much of Smart Growth makes sense, because we just can't keep doing what we have been. But it's government that sets the rules. And I don't see the rules changing soon.'''</p>
