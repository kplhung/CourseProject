        <p>EINSTEIN IN LOVE</p>
        <p>A Scientific Romance.</p>
        <p>By Dennis Overbye.</p>
        <p>416 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Viking. $27.95.</p>
        <p>A book called ''Einstein in Love''? Oh dear. It sounds like an unhappy compromise between a Miramax screenplay and a physics lesson. You can just imagine. As it opens, the dashing young Albert Einstein, looking rather like a Fiennes or a Baldwin, is hopelessly mired in his would-be ''theory of relativistic inertial electromagnetic invariance.'' Then he falls in love with a spirited babe-physicist, not unlike Gwyneth Paltrow in appearance. This romance sparks his crucial insight: the speed of light must be exactly the same for both the lover and his beloved (even if an unfeeling world has doomed them to occupy different frames of reference). Young Albert's theory, now happily renamed ''relativity,'' proves a boffo success, and the rest is history. Whatever its charms, this is not the scenario that emerges from Dennis Overbye's new book. Though it is subtitled ''A Scientific Romance,'' love fails to triumph. In fact, it is more of an antiromance, though none the less engaging for that.</p>
        <p>Until recently, little was known about Einstein's early life. His public image stemmed from his mature years, when he appeared to the world as (in the words of C. P. Snow) ''a wise and saintly golliwog.'' But a decade or so ago, after much legal wrangling, several shoe boxes' worth of the young Einstein's personal correspondence started turning up on the auction block. Revisionist biographers had a field day. Einstein, the letters indicated, had sired a daughter out of wedlock whom he never bothered to set eyes on. He cheated on his first wife, possibly beat her and may even have taken the relativity idea from her without credit. He then dumped her to marry his cousin, whom he also cheated on. He neglected the younger of his two sons after the child fell into schizophrenia. In general, he acted like an egomaniacal, misogynistic, philandering cad -- pretty much the way geniuses are supposed to.</p>
        <p>That, at any rate, is what the Einstein-debunkers claimed. Overbye, the deputy science editor of The New York Times, strikes a more judicious note as he plumbs the first 40 years of Einstein's life. His investigations have been suitably vast. He has, he tells us, gone through five eyeglass prescriptions trying to decipher Einstein's cramped handwriting. He revisited Einstein's bohemian haunts in Zurich, Prague and Berlin -- and does not let you forget it. He even describes how he clambered over the Alpine pass where Einstein's illegitimate daughter was conceived in 1901, taking the trouble to furnish us with the contemporary price of the condoms that Albert neglected to use.</p>
        <p>But Overbye is not merely concerned to reconstruct Einstein's intimate life. He also wants to show how it bore on the man's scientific discoveries. As it happens, these came in two miraculous bursts: one at the beginning of his first marriage, the other at the end. At 26, not long after he wed Mileva Maric, a Serbian physics student, Einstein published a quartet of papers that transformed our understanding of matter, of light and of space and time, culminating with the equation E=mc2. And as he was trying to dissolve his marriage to Mileva to marry Elsa, his divorced cousin, Einstein produced his general theory of relativity, by which (it is no exaggeration to say) he reinvented the universe.</p>
        <p>Now it would be pretty to think that both of these creative feats were somehow inspired by Einstein's passions, for Mileva in 1905, for Elsa a decade later. Nothing could be further from the truth. As Overbye makes clear, whatever ardor the young Einstein felt for his first wife had cooled by the time of their marriage. Mileva was four years his senior and was not aging well. She walked with a limp and was periodically troubled by goiters. Because of her Serbian origins, she was loathed by Einstein's mother, who was a bit of a dragon lady. Albert and Mileva's illegitimate daughter, little Lieserl, either died of scarlet fever or was given up for adoption; her fate continues to exercise other biographers' fancy, but Overbye sensibly declines to add to the speculation. Nor does he take seriously the claim that Mileva was the real brains; though she may have done some mathematical donkey-work for her husband, she was too distracted by the bearing and raising of his two boys to join him in his ''thought experiments.''</p>
        <p>By the time of Einstein's second florescence -- the one that gave rise to the general theory of relativity, which overthrew Newton's theory of gravity -- he had come to regard Mileva as, in his own words, ''an unfriendly humorless creature who has nothing from life herself and smothers the joy in life of others through her mere presence.'' When he left her and the children behind in Zurich to set up housekeeping with cousin Elsa in Berlin, Mileva underwent a physical and emotional collapse. To extricate himself from the nasty situation he had made for himself, Einstein was obliged to promise Mileva the money from any future Nobel Prize he might receive (which she finally got when he was awarded the 1921 Nobel in Physics). He was then free to marry Elsa -- although, as Overbye reveals, it was actually Elsa's daughter by her first marriage, the nubile Ilse, that Einstein had his eye on. Unfortunately, Ilse did not find Albert physically attractive.</p>
        <p>So it was not love in bloom, but love gone bad that seemed to bring out Einstein's real greatness. In the sticky circumstances of marital dissolution, he wrote, science ''lifts me impersonally, and without railing and wailing, from the vale of tears into peaceful spheres.'' Imagining himself surfing on a beam of light, or being pulled along in an accelerating elevator through empty space, he would have apparently simple insights that would lead him to remake physics. The remaking itself was far from effortless. To get his general theory of relativity to come out right, he spent the years 1915-17, Overbye writes, ''working like a horse, smoking like a chimney, and living on coffee, cheap sausage and cookies.'' (The name ''relativity'' is something of a misnomer. What Einstein wanted was a law of physics valid for all observers everywhere in the universe, regardless of their relative motion or special coordinate systems: a law that, while allowing space and time to be relative, would make truth absolute.)</p>
        <p>Overbye does a very nice job of explaining the conceptual and mathematical difficulties that Einstein surmounted on his way to this goal; indeed, the scientific exposition in this book is almost as racy as the biographical bits. Occasionally Overbye gets a tad rhapsodic, as when he describes an eclipse: ''The vermilion sky winks into stars, and behold! The sun is replaced by an inky hole feathered by the pale, pearly fire of the corona.'' My only other complaint is that, perhaps for cinematic effect, he tends to overrate the looks of his subjects. Even as a young man, Einstein was never quite ''beautiful''; Mileva may have had ''smooth cat cheeks'' and ''thick, sensuous lips,'' but she was otherwise unprepossessing; and Elsa could only be called ''comely'' if you would also say that of a very stout Valkyrie.</p>
        <p>Although Einstein may have lusted after many women, he did remain true throughout his life to a single philosophical conception of the world. His metaphysical outlook served him well as a young man, as Overbye ably explains. Following the 17th-century philosopher Leibniz, Einstein held that space and time had no objective reality. It was this conviction that enabled him to grasp the meaning of relativity, which eluded his more mathematically gifted contemporaries. (''Einstein is not innately a mathematician,'' grumbled one of them, Felix Klein, ''but works rather under the influence of obscure physical-philosophical impulses.'') Yet Einstein also believed that the world was ultimately rational, that events within it must unfold according to the logic of cause and effect. Because of this metaphysical prejudice, he could never reconcile himself to the coming quantum theory, which made things look rather crazily random at the subatomic level (God does not play dice with the world, he insisted).</p>
        <p>''Einstein in Love'' concludes in 1919: the year he turned 40, the year he finally obtained his divorce from Mileva and the year he achieved international celebrity when his general theory of relativity was triumphantly confirmed. For the next three and a half decades until his death in 1955, the world awaited Einstein's next great discovery. Nothing happened. His long toil to produce a unified field theory -- one that would subjugate ugly quantum mechanics to the elegantly deterministic framework of relativity, thereby rendering nature reasonable again -- proved barren. Einstein stayed faithfully in love with the universe as he understood it. But his love was no longer requited.</p>
