        <p>Scattered around the visitors' locker room, the Giants' players tried their best to put on brave faces, speaking of the solid play that had gotten them into the 13th inning rather than dwelling on the cruel ending. But a rookie sat tucked in the farthest corner, facing cameras and attention that he never thought would come his way.</p>
        <p>Aaron Fultz was the sixth Giants pitcher in the game, after spectacular performances as well as odd failures. Five innings of no-hit ball by starter Russ Ortiz was a distant memory, and by the 13th inning, when Fultz stared down Benny Agbayani, so too was Robb Nen's blown save.</p>
        <p>The Giants' higher-profile pitchers had already had their chances, and it was left to Fultz, who aimed a fastball down and away to Agbayani but left it high over the plate.</p>
        <p>Agbayani put it 385 feet away in the left-center bleachers, giving the Mets a 3-2 victory over the Giants in Game 3 of the division series.</p>
        <p>As chants of ''Benny! Benny!'' reverberated through the stands, Fultz walked off solemnly. Now in the locker room he faced quiet questions and answered them in hushed tones, too.</p>
        <p>''It was just a high fastball, a bad pitch, and he hit it,'' he said. ''He did what he's supposed to do with that pitch. Most balls that go that far are not where you want them. I was trying to go down and away, and it was a fastball up.''</p>
        <p>Giants Manager Dusty Baker had endured two days of second-guessing after he chose not to insert Nen into Game 2 and lost the game with Felix Rodriguez on the mound. That Fultz was left to explain away the latest Giants loss, one that pushed them to the brink of elimination, was not the result of any faulty decision-making; desperation dictated Baker's moves as the game wore on.</p>
        <p>In the eighth inning, protecting a one-run lead with two out and a runner on first, Baker called Nen from the bullpen, providing as close to a sure thing as there has been in baseball this season.</p>
        <p>Nen had not blown a save since July 2, converting 28 consecutive opportunities, the longest streak in the major leagues. In 32 appearances after the All-Star Game break, he was 1-0 with 24 saves and a 0.85 earned run average, surrendering just three earned runs over that span, and had retired the Mets in order in one inning in Game 1.</p>
        <p>Facing Edgardo Alfonzo, Nen started with a called strike, seemingly a formality. But on the pitch, Lenny Harris stole second, although that may have seemed a formality, too, against Nen. But after a ball, Nen allowed a slider to linger over the plate and Alfonzo drove it hard over third baseman Bill Mueller, the ball rolling to the corner as Harris sped home with the tying run.</p>
        <p>''I don't try to think about how nasty he is,'' Alfonzo said of Nen.</p>
        <p>For all the talk of the home-field advantage held by the Giants in Pacific Bell Park, this cold, noisy place seemed to rattle the Giants relievers with 56,270 fans screaming in their ears and planes and trains rattling by just outside the visitors' bullpen.</p>
        <p>Nen failed, and Rodriguez struggled behind him, too. ''Robbie is the best at what he does,'' Ortiz said. ''Obviously, I don't think anyone feels like he's not going to get the job done. I think everybody is pretty confident of that. But nobody's perfect.</p>
        <p>''It's one of those things that just didn't turn out our way, but we're still playing. We've got to keep our heads up, come back tomorrow and see what we can do.''</p>
        <p>While Nen has rarely tasted failure, he has seen it enough to be able to speak to Fultz, providing him with comforting words, even on a night when he needed them himself.</p>
