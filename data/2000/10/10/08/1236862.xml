        <p>Collections of American Indian and Northwest art have a new home at the Portland Art Museum, which recently unveiled its 50,000-square-foot Hoffman Wing in a renovated 1969 building that once served as the museum's art school. The new wing expands the gallery space by 50 percent.</p>
        <p>The Arlene and Harold Schnitzer Center for Northwest Art, one of the two collections in the new wing, features the work of Northwest artists as well as work about the Northwest by artists like the painter Childe Hassam. Commissioned for the center is an installation by the Seattle glass artist William Morris that consists of 400 handblown ''artifacts'' attached to a three-story-tall panel.</p>

        <p>Collections of American Indian and Northwest art have a new home at the Portland Art Museum, which recently unveiled its 50,000-square-foot Hoffman Wing in a renovated 1969 building that once served as the museum's art school. The new wing expands the gallery space by 50 percent.</p>
        <p>The Arlene and Harold Schnitzer Center for Northwest Art, one of the two collections in the new wing, features the work of Northwest artists as well as work about the Northwest by artists like the painter Childe Hassam. Commissioned for the center is an installation by the Seattle glass artist William Morris that consists of 400 handblown ''artifacts'' attached to a three-story-tall panel.</p>
        <p>The other collection, in the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Center for Native American Art, includes more than 4,000 objects by some 200 indigenous North American groups, as well as by pre-Columbian peoples from Central and South America. About 400 works will be on display at a time. Highlights include an early 20th-century woven Chilkat coat with brown-bear and raven designs, objects adorned with quill-wrapped horsehair, and a four-foot prehistoric stone figure of a man sculptured in the Columbia River style.</p>
        <p>The new wing is linked to the rest of the museum by two new galleries where upcoming shows include ''In Search of the Promised Land: Paintings by Frederick Edwin Church'' (Oct. 20 to Jan. 3), and ''Painting Revolution: Kandinsky, Malevich and the Russian Avant-Garde'' (Nov. 1 to Jan. 7). The museum, whose permanent collection includes European, Asian, African and American art, has also recently renovated its outdoor sculpture garden.</p>
        <p>The Portland Art Museum, 1219 Southwest Park Avenue, is open Tuesday to Sunday. Admission is $7.50, $6 seniors and students, $4 ages 5 to 18. Information: (503) 226-2811, or on the museum's Web site www.portlandartmuseum.org.</p>
