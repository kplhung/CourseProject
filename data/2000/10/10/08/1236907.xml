        <p>CONDUCTOR searches are today a fixture of the North American symphonic scene; the New York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Minnesota Orchestra and the Toronto Symphony are among the orchestras that need to find a new music director. Too often, the strategy of choice seems to be to land a celebrated maestro, then rely on him (or her) to shape (or not) the mission at hand.

        <p>Higginson's method is laid bare in a remarkable series of letters never (to my knowledge) previously cited or quoted. They document his search for a music director to replace Wilhelm Gericke, who resigned his Boston Symphony post as of the close of the 1905-06 season. Higginson compiled a list of 25 candidates, including every great European name: Arthur Nikisch, Gustav Mahler, Felix Mottl, Karl Muck, Hans Richter, Franz Schalk, Richard Strauss, Bruno Walter, Felix Weingartner, Henry Wood. The letters, from the spring and summer of 1906, are instructions to his delegates in Germany and Austria: the composer George Chadwick and the Boston Symphony's manager, Charles Ellis.</p>

        <p>CONDUCTOR searches are today a fixture of the North American symphonic scene; the New York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Minnesota Orchestra and the Toronto Symphony are among the orchestras that need to find a new music director. Too often, the strategy of choice seems to be to land a celebrated maestro, then rely on him (or her) to shape (or not) the mission at hand. A better strategy, exemplified by Henry Higginson in the early days of the Boston Symphony, is to set the mission first, then find a conductor who fits.</p>
        <p>Higginson's method is laid bare in a remarkable series of letters never (to my knowledge) previously cited or quoted. They document his search for a music director to replace Wilhelm Gericke, who resigned his Boston Symphony post as of the close of the 1905-06 season. Higginson compiled a list of 25 candidates, including every great European name: Arthur Nikisch, Gustav Mahler, Felix Mottl, Karl Muck, Hans Richter, Franz Schalk, Richard Strauss, Bruno Walter, Felix Weingartner, Henry Wood. The letters, from the spring and summer of 1906, are instructions to his delegates in Germany and Austria: the composer George Chadwick and the Boston Symphony's manager, Charles Ellis.</p>
        <p>Relying on reports from the pianist Julius Epstein (an old school chum from Vienna), the soprano Milka Ternina and other well-placed sources, Higginson appraises the field. He also articulates, in no uncertain terms, what he is looking for. Prospective Boston conductors, he tells Ellis, should know ''that I do not like too much modern music and that I do not want the extreme modern style of conducting.'' In another letter, he amplifies:</p>
        <p>''If you see Walter or Mengelberg, you will have to say to them . . . that I do know something about music, and that I have very distinct ideas as to how music should be played; that I shall not meddle with modern music, but that I shall certainly ask them to play the classics as they were played. I was brought up in the Vienna school (as you know) and there were plenty of men living then who had heard Beethoven conduct, as well as Mendelssohn, and knew how he wished his music given. I have known Brahms myself and heard his music. You know well enough what I wish, and I shall not interfere unduly with any of these men, but I don't want crazy work (such as sometimes even Nikisch gave us, and [Emil] Paur gave us too often), and perhaps you had better tell them that I hate noise.''</p>
        <p>Higginson is quick to weed out Raabe (''distinctly second rate''), Schneevoigt (''the same'') and Steinbach (''not a conductor of genius''). Franz Kneisel, the Boston Symphony's eminent concertmaster, has highly recommended Mahler; Higginson is surely correct in surmising, ''I . . . should not expect to have any peace with him.''</p>
        <p>The letters reveal that Higginson offered Nikisch, his music director from 1889 to 1894, a five-year contract beginning in 1906. Nikisch was just the kind of ''modern'' conductor, given to expressive infidelities to the score, that Higginson decried. But Higginson also recognized Nikisch as a genius. When this negotiation went nowhere, he seriously considered a short-term offer to the young Bruno Walter; evidently, he believed Boston ready for a Jewish music director. (In an earlier letter to his father, Higginson wrote that Epstein, in Vienna, was the first Jew he had ever met.)</p>
        <p>ULTIMATELY, Higginson resolved, as of June 4, that ''we are better with Muck than with any one of the whole crew.'' He accurately understood that Karl Muck was at once a world-class orchestra leader and a confirmed traditionalist. And yet Higginson regarded him as ''a powerful jackass,'' by which he apparently meant that Muck was a prima donna who couldn't make up his mind about the Boston offer.</p>
        <p>Higginson landed Muck in time for the new season, and Muck proved right for Boston. He led the orchestra until 1908 and then again from 1912 to 1918. His tenure was cut short by World War I, during which he found himself interned in Georgia as an enemy alien, and was afterward shipped back to Germany.</p>
        <p>Though aware of Muck's Germanic political sympathies, Higginson stuck by his conductor to the end. Shortly afterward, he stepped down as the orchestra's de facto owner in favor of a board of trustees. He died in November 1918 at 83. A year later, The Boston Post disclosed that Muck had been having an affair with a 20-year-old in Boston's Back Bay and had written her a letter reading in part: ''I am on my way to the concert hall to entertain the crowds of dogs and swine who think that because they pay the entrance fee they have the right to dictate to me my selections. I hate to play for this rabble. . . . [In] a very short time our gracious Kaiser will smile on my request and recall me to Berlin. . . . Our Kaiser will be prevailed upon to see the benefit to the Fatherland of my obtaining a divorce and making you my own.''</p>
        <p>Muck's love letters, known to the United States Department of Justice, were doubtless one reason for his wartime troubles. Perhaps he was a powerful jackass after all.</p>
