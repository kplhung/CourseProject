        <p>A grass-roof building, the largest in Britain, containing a large-screen theater has opened in the Lake District of England. Rheged, as the 80,000-square-foot center is called, is the name used to refer to the region's Ancient Kingdom of Cumbria, which existed between 400 and 700 A.D. The structure, which was designed by Jak Jones, a local architect, is in a natural hollow in the landscape. Sunlight enters through seven glass atriums; interiors include babbling brooks, limestone crags and waterfalls -- features found in the surrounding countryside.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of the attraction is a 40-minute film, ''Rheged: The Lost Kingdom,'' narrated by Derek Jacobi, and shown on a 60-by-48-foot screen. The film explores the history of the Lake District by following an American who travels from New York to learn about his ancestors, giving special attention to Celtic battles, Arthurian legend, the region's mysterious stone circles and Wordsworth. An exhibition encouraging visitors to explore the area includes photographs and projected images of Cumbrian highlights, such as a window from Carlisle Cathedral, Hadrian's Wall and Roman shields. A tourist information area outside the exhibit will help visitors arrange itineraries centered on their particular interests, such as local stately homes and gardens or Roman sites.</p>

        <p>A grass-roof building, the largest in Britain, containing a large-screen theater has opened in the Lake District of England.

        <p>The building has a number of restaurants, devoted to promoting local delicacies, play areas for children and shops selling Cumbrian crafts. A local potter gives demonstrations, and visitors can operate a papermaking machine.</p>
        <p>Rheged, in Redhills, Penrith, is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is free. The film is $7.40, $5.25 children. Information: (44-1768) 868000, www.rheged.com.</p>
