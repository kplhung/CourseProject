        <p>THE life story of John Levi Washington Jr., the editor in chief of Street News, reads like an amalgam of a Beat novel, missionary tract and down-and-out version of ''The Front Page.''</p>
        <p>Known to everyone as Indio, a name he says was ''given to him by the Great Spirit'' during a session of meditation, Mr. Washington has led Street News, the newspaper sold by the homeless, since 1996. Once homeless himself, he seems perfectly suited to his job, a colorful personality who easily slips from street slang to publishing jargon.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people who write about homelessness haven't been there and done that,'' he said. ''I've been there and done that, and I don't want to do it again.''</p>
        <p>With the economy booming, Mr. Washington finds it hard to draw people's attention to the homeless. But he is dedicated to keep the struggling newspaper alive to shine a light on a problem he says is as bad as it was in the late 1980's and early 90's.</p>
        <p>''If you come around 10:30 at night and go to the front of 100 Centre Street, you'll see them out there,'' he said of the homeless, whose numbers are notoriously difficult to gauge. But, he added, ''The newspapers and television stations aren't concerned with homelessness, and the majority of people listen to the news media.''</p>
        <p>The paper was founded by a charity-minded musician in 1989, at the height of public concern about homelessness, to give street people something to sell as an alternative to panhandling. Although it once printed as many as 250,000 copies every two weeks, Street News now publishes only 9,000 papers, which are sold by about 40 homeless people on the streets and, illegally, in the subways, Mr. Washington said. Just five issues have been distributed so far this year.</p>
        <p>The newspaper once had offices in Manhattan but is now edited out of Mr. Washington's apartment in Kew Gardens Hills, Queens. The hands-off owner, Sam Chen, president of Expedi Printing, cheerfully admits that it is not profitable, even though  publishing an issue costs just over $3,000.</p>
        <p>Then again, his editor receives no salary.</p>
        <p>That does not seem to bother Mr. Washington, 61, who said he lives off a city pension. Despite a limp caused by an arthritic hip, he chases down advertisers, lugs copies to the five newsstands in Manhattan and Queens where homeless vendors pick them up, and cajoles articles out of his unpaid writers, some homeless, some not.</p>
        <p>''He represents what Street News strives to be,'' said Jon Hart, a freelance journalist and former Street News editor who hired Mr. Washington as an advertising salesman in 1993. ''He lifted himself out of the gutter, and he's being very productive and helping people. I think about him every time I try to achieve anything.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Washington was born in Harlem to a father from the Virgin Islands and a mother who was Cherokee and Seminole. As a teenager, he trawled the city with the Harlem Lords, a street gang. After marrying, he worked at a glass and shade company and sang in doo-wop groups.</p>
        <p>In 1971, he began selling drugs and eventually spent two years in prison.</p>
        <p>After his release in 1975, Mr. Washington, by then divorced, continued a life of crime, selling cocaine and operating a brothel. Then he had what he calls a semiconversion.  In 1977, he was ordained a minister of the nonsectarian Universal Unity Life Church and began working as a counselor for social service groups. He also got a master's degree in education from Fordham.</p>
        <p>Throughout the 1980's, Mr. Washington stayed out of trouble. But after his second marriage fell apart, he had a breakdown and found himself a broken man on the streets. ''It was like a nightmare,'' he said. ''When you are doing bad, when you are down and out, there's very few people that will help you.''</p>
        <p>For three years, he slept in Tompkins Square Park and used drugs, for which he was jailed again. Eventually, he was drawn to Street News, which he had sold when he was on the streets. Mr. Hart remembered when Mr. Washington first arrived.</p>
        <p>''He was persistent and we needed help,'' he said. ''The place was a shanty, with people sleeping on the floor. But he came to work and treated it like it was Conde Nast. He wore a suit and tie. He brought in sandwiches for fellow employees. He cut out clips from newspapers and put them on the wall.''</p>
        <p>Another editor, Lee Stringer, was less impressed.</p>
        <p>''I was originally against hiring him,'' said Mr. Stringer, who after leaving the paper wrote the acclaimed book ''Grand Central Winter: Stories From the Streets.''  ''He wasn't a great salesman, but he made himself infinitely useful by taking jobs nobody else wanted.''</p>
        <p>In the next few years, as money dried up because of waning interest in the homeless, Mr. Washington and Mr. Stringer worked to keep the paper going. In 1996, the paper moved to Mr. Washington's Queens apartment. When Mr. Stringer entered drug rehabilitation, his partner took the helm.</p>
        <p>It hasn't been easy. A new issue is published only after all copies of the previous issue have been sold. And it's tough to manage the homeless vendors, who buy copies for 60 cents apiece and sell them for whatever they can get, pocketing the difference. But Mr. Washington, who says his only vices are cigarettes and the occasional beer, has a rapport with them.</p>
        <p>''He's a very, very sharp brother,'' said the formerly homeless Christopher Boyd, who started selling the paper eight years ago and now lives in a subsidized apartment. ''I am very grateful for everything he's done for me.''</p>
        <p>The most recent edition was published last weekend. It had 44 pages and included essays, a column by Mumia Abu-Jamal, who is on death row for killing a Philadelphia police officer, testimonies from homeless vendors, self-help columns and a few examples of the writings of Mr. Washington.</p>
        <p>''The best part is reading the first issue that comes off the presses,'' said Mr. Washington, sounding like any newspaper editor. ''It's like a new baby. And then you see a mistake and you want to kick yourself.''</p>
