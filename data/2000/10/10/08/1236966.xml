        <p>CANTINA POMODORO, a tiny new spot in Huntington Village, is a niche restaurant. Diners with a sense of adventure, who love surprises and enjoy being coddled will find it a pleasure. Those who are finicky about food, have strong likes and dislikes, have dietary restrictions or food allergies might want avoid it.</p>
        <p>That is because there are few choices here. Patrons eat what the chef cooks: a set meal of six small courses beginning with an amuse-bouche, or the Italian equivalent of the tiny palate pleaser that precedes the appetizer, right through to the dessert of the night. Only at entree time is there a choice and then only between two or three possibilities.  The dinner costs between $40 and $50, depending on the main course picked.</p>
        <p>Cantina Pomodoro is next door to Ristorante Pomodoro and has the same owners. This is their 14th venture. In addition to the well-known Pomodoro and Pomodorino restaurants, which dot Long Island and Manhattan, they also run the posh Enoteca in Locust Valley.</p>
        <p>Cantina Pomodoro, like its elegant big brother, is wine-centered. There are photographs of wine cellars, vineyards and wine making on the walls and a lineup of wine bottles crowds the service bar. A mammoth temperature-controlled wine cabinet is in the rear of the dining room; a wine cellar containing between 150 and 200 selections is on the premises; and 40 wines are served by the glass, including two great Gayas from Italy at $40 and $45. Wine drinkers looking for value should consider the $20 add-on to the meal, which pays for five glasses, one with each course. With wine by the glass priced at a minimum of $7, that is a bargain and the wine is knowledgeably paired with each dish.</p>
        <p>Diners feel as if they are eating in someone's home. Cut-velvet couches, where patrons can drink a glass of wine, have a coffee, just chat or play a game of chess, augment the homey feeling. There are gilt-framed mirrors, silk brocade draperies, fresh flowers and only six tables.</p>
        <p>The staff is very attentive and accommodating. A few members, though, have limited English. They delivered Coke instead of Diet Coke and didn't understand a request for butter. (Warm slices of good Italian bread are served solo, just as they are in Italy.) Even though most diners opt for the full meal, those desiring less can order it. A preschooler at the next table chirped, ''I want a bowl of spaghetti.'' He received a smile and a reply of, ''I think we can do that.''</p>
        <p>The full meal is a lovingly orchestrated progression of dishes made from whatever is best at the market that day. A celery-corn-basil soup starred local corn freshly cut from the cob. Desserts on two occasions featured straight-from-the-orchard peaches: a moist peach tart and baked peaches sprinkled with amaretti cookie crumbs atop a chocolate sauce spiked with amaretto.</p>
        <p>A few dishes needed a dash of salt to bring them to life and boiled Yukon gold potatoes, which were part of an appetizer, would have benefited from more cooking time. Still, the vast majority of the creations were soul-satisfying delights. Pastas were especially noteworthy: homemade tagliatelle in a family-style ragu of finely diced beef and carrots, and raviolis filled with veal and tender meat from beef short ribs in a sage butter, sprinkled with poppy seeds.</p>
        <p>One evening entree choices were Chilean sea bass and jumbo shrimp in a tomato-tinged broth, fall-away-tender chicken sauteed with red and yellow peppers and a veal stew with peas. All fine picks. Another time it was rabbit roasted with oregano and black olives, a fish and seafood stew with polenta or a skewer of shrimp and calamari sprinkled with crumbs, broiled and served over a tangle of julienne zucchini and yellow squash flecked with hot red peppers.</p>
        <p>A young woman at our table, who doesn't like fish, skipped her appetizer, a salmon-radicchio, two-crusted tart. It was delicious and we ate her share. Her father-in-law, who never met a bean he liked, passed on the red bean-mushroom soup. Still, no one leaves Cantina Pomodoro hungry. Even the persnickety will have many reasons to smile.</p>
