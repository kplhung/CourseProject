        <p>''Imagine all the people. . . .''</p>
        <p>Mindy Ohman from Minneapolis was singing quietly at the edge of the John Lennon memorial in Central Park on Thursday morning. Stacy Leroy from East New York, Brooklyn, walked up and joined her for a few bars. Then they looked at each other, grinning.</p>
        <p>''What comes next?'' Mr. Leroy asked sheepishly.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ohman was silent for a second or two, then sighed and said, ''God, that's such a cool song.''</p>
        <p>Neither of them remembered the rest of the lyrics to Lennon's dreamy call for peace. But both decided to visit the memorial for the first time after hearing that the  state's Division of Parole had just denied a request for parole by Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman, who is serving a term of 20 years to life in Attica state prison.</p>
        <p>They were not alone. It has been nearly 20 years since Mr. Chapman shot and killed the legendary Beatle outside his apartment building, the Dakota, on 72nd Street and Central Park West. For those who loved Lennon, the Dakota has long been his Graceland. But since Wednesday, when the decision was handed down, the usual trickle of tourists outside the Dakota has swelled as local residents stopped by to remember the man and his music.</p>
        <p>''I used to wear Lennon glasses,'' said Mr. Leroy, 23, ''and I've seen the memorial in pictures, but to see it in person is a great experience.''</p>
        <p>Some people stood on the corner, snapping photos of the building's creamy brown facade or asking the doorman for insider information about Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono. The doorman's usual reply was, ''Hey, I was just a kid when he was killed.'' Others hung out at Strawberry Fields inside the park, placing bouquets on the tiled memorial or wishing Lennon a happy birthday. If he were still alive, he would have turned 60 tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Brendan O'Leary, a 42-year-old postman from Southport, England, has visited the Dakota three times before, but he returned on Thursday to ruminate about Lennon and the parole board's decision.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult to describe why people loved him,'' Mr. O'Leary said, ''but his songs and his words said something real to me. I never met the guy, but I cried when he died.</p>
        <p>''I know they say everyone should be given a second chance, but I don't know about Chapman. What if he's still basking in his fame? Imagine that.''</p>
