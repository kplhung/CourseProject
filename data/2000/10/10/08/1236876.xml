        <p>Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the president of Sri Lanka, is a virtual prisoner in the fortress of her official residence, locked away in a lovely, white-washed mansion from the suicide bombers who prowl the traffic-clogged streets of the capital, Colombo. They wait for a chance to blow themselves up and take her with them, all in the cause of a separate homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority. Even with parliamentary elections crucial to the future of her government looming on Oct. 10, Kumaratunga, a formidable, instinctive campaigner, has not appeared at public rallies because of fears she will be killed.</p>
        <p>Late one night in August, she sat with regal formality behind an imposing, antique desk in her darkened office, her lustrous black hair swept back in a bun, and over the next two hours she talked about murder in a torrent of precisely enunciated words. It is a defining theme, not only of her life, but also of Sri Lanka's post-independence history. In the matter-of-fact manner that other political leaders might employ in conversing about economic policies or diplomatic conundrums, she spoke of children chopped to pieces, burning piles of bodies and corpses floating in rivers. Her broad, expressive face, bathed in the glow of light from a desk lamp, was by turns animated and as hard as stone as she described in clinical detail the incidents of violence that have torn her life apart.</p>
        <p>She was 14, in class at convent school, when her father, the prime minister, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, the Oxford-educated scion of an elite Sinhalese family, was assassinated by a Buddhist monk in 1959 on the veranda of the family home. His was the first political murder -- the original sin -- in this lush island nation that has since seen tens of thousands more killings committed by government-sponsored death squads, Sinhalese leftist insurgents and separatist Tamil guerrillas, among others. Kumaratunga's father was succeeded by her mother, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who became the first in</p>
        <p>a line of widows and bereaved children to rise to power across South Asia -- in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as Sri Lanka -- following assassinations.</p>
        <p>Kumaratunga was 42 at the time of her second ordeal. She was standing on the doorstep of her home in 1988 when a hit man from a leftist group shot her husband, Vijaya, himself a rising politician, a film idol and the father of her children, then 5 and 7. ''I was the only one who ran toward the scene -- the others ran away; so I must have had some inkling of this courage always,'' she said. ''I saw the murderer pumping bullets into my husband's head.'' The killer glanced at her, she said, then fled. By the time she got to her husband, ''he had no more head.'' Half a million people attended his funeral, which was carried live on state television.</p>
        <p>The cameras were rolling again last December when Kumaratunga herself came close to death at a campaign rally on the grounds of Colombo's town hall. It was pouring rain that night, just three days before elections that would decide whether she would be re-elected president for a second term. Thousands were waiting for her beneath umbrellas and soggy newspapers. When she arrived, she waved jubilantly to the crowd and flashed a dazzling smile. After she spoke about her plan to bring peace to the nation, she descended from the dais. Journalists encircled her, thrusting microphones in her face.</p>
        <p>Then she emerged into the clear. In one camera frame, she is walking confidently toward her chauffeur-driven car. In the next, the lens is filled with a shimmering explosion of orange light. A female suicide bomber from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam had detonated the explosives strapped to her waist, propelling bits of her shredded flesh and hundreds of ball bearings toward Kumaratunga. The cameras next found the president crouched and bloody on the pavement, surrounded by the howls of the dying.</p>
        <p>As she sat in the dark of her office, she recounted how she had kept her wits. ''A lot of the men were screaming, crying and terrified and saying, 'Am I going to die?' I was directing operations even at that time. Blood was pouring from my two eyes.'' One piece of shrapnel had entered the bridge of her nose, damaging her optic nerve and blinding her right eye. A pellet lodged in her neck. ''There it is, you can feel it,'' she said, rubbing a finger on the underside of her chin. A third projectile came within a quarter-inch of her brain. Once she was in the car, her driver headed for the official residence, but she exclaimed, ''Are you mad?'' and ordered him to take her to a hospital.</p>
        <p>In the hospital, she recalled, she felt as if she were floating above a room full of weeping people. She heard one of them say that Sinhalese youth were vowing to kill every last Tamil in retaliation for the bomber's attack. In the past, bouts of anti-Tamil rioting had raged with the complicity of earlier governments. People had been burned alive. Hundreds had been murdered. She roused herself to consciousness and summoned her secretary. She told him to go on television with a message to the people. ''Tell them I'm fine,'' she said. ''And then I thought of a little shrewd move. I know that when people are excited and wanting violence, when they go to a place of worship, they do become calm. I said, 'Tell them my only request is that first they should remain calm and don't try to harm anybody, and secondly that they should all go to their places of worship and pray for me.''' That night, the peace held.</p>
        <p>Days later, having won with 51 percent of the vote, Kumaratunga took office. Upon mentioning her children in her inaugural address, she lowered her bandaged face into her hand. Her ragged breathing was amplified over the microphone as she struggled to compose herself. She went on to say: ''I have suffered our nation's sorrow in every way humanly possible. In the vicious pain of losing a father. In the loving pain of motherhood. In the soul-destroying pain of losing a husband. And now, finally, I have nearly stepped over the threshold of my life into the deep abyss of the unknown darkness, only to be miraculously saved by the powers that be in order that I serve your further.''</p>
        <p>Since the attack, Kumaratunga has lived in claustrophobic splendor, a charismatic, partly blinded ruler, emotionally scarred by each phase of her country's violent past. She has had losses enough in her 55 years to become the embodiment of a politics of sorrow. She remains the only Sinhalese leader to have repeatedly risked her political future for the idea that the grievances of the Tamil minority must be addressed. At the same time, she has allowed herself to undermine these very goals by becoming snared in enmities with her Sinhalese rivals that have derailed the country's best hopes for peace. Like Sri Lanka itself, the president seems torn between contradictory impulses of reconciliation and revenge.</p>
        <p>It is sometimes said in Colombo that Kumaratunga's father planted the seeds of Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict, that her mother nurtured them and that she has been left to reap the bitter harvest. Her father, Bandaranaike, was the first national leader to successfully exploit the ethnic tensions between the Tamils and the Sinhalese for electoral gain. During the British colonial era, when Sri Lanka was still known as Ceylon, the predominantly Hindu Tamils, who made up a little more than a fifth of the population, had come to be disproportionately represented in the civil service and the professions. This aroused a deep resentment among the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese majority, who constituted about 70 percent of the population.</p>
        <p>In the 1956 election that made him prime minister, Bandaranaike tapped into the festering Sinhalese anger toward the Tamil-speaking minority, campaigning for a Sinhala-only language policy. The first violent clashes between the Tamils and the Sinhalese flared after his election over this emotional issue. Following his assassination, his wife, Sirimavo, pursued policies that further inflamed Sinhalese-Tamil tensions during her two stints as head of state, from 1960 to 1965 and 1970 to 1977.</p>
        <p>The Bandaranaike children grew up in the thick of Sri Lankan politics. ''We breathed, ate, drank and lived politics,'' said Kumaratunga, who was the middle child. She remembers sitting on the arm of her father's chair, absorbing it all. Her political education continued while she was a student radical at the University of Paris in the 1960's. ''I was on the barricades,'' she said. ''I became a revolutionary there.''</p>
        <p>Back in Sri Lanka, she worked on land reform issues in her mother's government. But in 1977, her mother was swept from office. Kumaratunga, then in her 30's, showed a streak of independence from her mother, personally and politically. The next year, despite her mother's disapproval, she married Vijaya Kumaratunga, a magnetic, politically ambitious movie star from a lower caste. Anura, Kumaratunga's estranged brother, said his sister's husband was seen as being out of her league. ''He'd sit on the ground and drink arrack with his cronies,'' he said. ''That was different from Chandrika sitting with her friends, sipping wine and discussing movies and theater.''</p>
        <p>During the 17 years the Bandaranaike family was out of power, Sri Lanka saw the ghastly maturation of a political culture of violence that found ready recruits in the alienated ranks of its educated, unemployed youth, both Tamil and Sinhalese. The country had done a remarkable job of building a literate society, but its state-dominated Socialist economy had failed to produce enough jobs -- a situation that bred what Lal Jayawardena, who was an economic adviser to President Kumaratunga, called ''endemic insurrection.''</p>
        <p>The Tamil rebellion, which began in 1983 after horrific anti-Tamil riots raged through Colombo, has become one of the world's most vicious, intractable civil wars, claiming more than 60,000 lives. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a ruthless separatist group that sends child soldiers into battle and young people on suicide missions, has been fighting for a separate nation in the country's north and east, which it considers the historic Tamil homeland.</p>
        <p>Just a year after the war began, Kumaratunga and her husband broke with her family's Sri Lanka Freedom Party (S.L.F.P.) to start their own party, which took a much more liberal line on power-sharing with the Tamils. ''The S.L.F.P. was becoming impossibly chauvinistic,'' Kumaratunga said. Their new party was on the verge of announcing an alliance with several Tamil groups in 1988 when Vijaya Kumaratunga was murdered by Sinhalese radicals. Fearing for her own life, Kumaratunga and her two children moved to London, where they remained until the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Back in Sri Lanka in 1992, Kumaratunga returned to politics, rejoining the S.L.F.P. and quickly rising to prominence. Her brother, Anura, overshadowed, joined the family's despised political rival, the United National Party. According to Anura, his sister's rise was the result of a failed political gambit by their mother. ''My mother played this game between her two children: she'd promote me when Chandrika was too strong and Chandrika when I was too strong,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In November 1994, Kumaratunga was elected president in a landslide victory, redeeming the Bandaranaike family's claim on power by promising a war-weary nation that she would start talks with the Tamil Tigers and introduce a new constitution that would give the Tamils more regional autonomy. Both Tamils and Sinhalese hoped she would have the magic to bring peace.</p>
        <p>But things quickly went very wrong. In April 1995, her government's negotiations with the Tigers collapsed when the rebels sunk two warships in Trincomalee harbor. Feeling tricked, the president went to war with a vengeance. The last six years have been among the bloodiest in the country's history. According to official estimates, 8,502 of the 13,542 troops killed in the conflict have died since she took office.</p>
        <p>Kumaratunga has also been unable to forge a consensus with the rival U.N.P. for the new constitution and did not have the votes to get it adopted in Parliament without opposition support. Her last-ditch effort to negotiate a compromise with the U.N.P. leader Ranil Wickremesinghe collapsed in acrimony this summer. She then sought to ram the constitution through Parliament in a matter of days.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 3, Kumaratunga left the safety of her residence for a rare trip to Parliament to introduce the constitution. Helicopters hovered overhead, antiaircraft guns sat menacingly on the lawns and police boats floated in the small lake that surrounds the Parliament building, ready to repel any attack. During her impassioned hour-and-a-half-long speech, U.N.P. members heckled her, tore the proposed constitution into little pieces and even set it on fire.</p>
        <p>These vituperative exchanges between Kumaratunga and the political opposition discouraged intellectuals and peace advocates. ''I have enormous respect for her instincts on the ethnic question,'' said Rohan Edrisinha, director of the Center for Policy Alternatives in Colombo. ''But she's also such a chaotic, arrogant person that you sometimes despair that she has the necessary management skills for a negotiated settlement and the discipline to compromise when necessary.''</p>
        <p>President Kumaratunga's ability to break the country's political impasse depends on winning a big majority in the coming parliamentary elections. But instead of barnstorming the country, she is trapped at home behind barricades and bunkers fortified with olive green sandbags. Last month, as candidates fanned out across the nation, she plodded on with the mundane tasks of running the government. She listened patiently to the gripes of chamber of commerce representatives and met with members of a child-protection task force. During a two-hour session with wildlife and zoo officials, she inquired into the state of elephants, leopards and turtles.</p>
        <p>At times, she seemed to carry the frustration of her political seclusion lightly. ''The knowledge that you can get bumped off is not fun,'' she said with a wry smile as she posed for a photo shoot on the colonnaded veranda of her residence. She offered to change into a more flattering blue sari and tugged on the silken cloth that draped over her shoulder and across her midriff. ''Let's hide the rolls of fat,'' she said with a rich laugh. At one point, she crossed her arms and looked queenly. ''I'll be imperious,'' she declared impishly. Then, an instant later, she turned on a flamboyant smile -- wide and womanly.</p>
        <p>But she also showed a darker side. In a conversation at the presidential residence last month, she was spoiling for a fight. She seemed less the tragic figure seeking to heal a wounded nation and more the politician out to settle scores. She zestfully accused Wickremesinghe of watching as men were tortured at a secret state-run interrogation facility in the late 1980's. A commission of inquiry she appointed concluded in a report published in February that Wickremesinghe was ''indirectly responsible'' for the torture chambers, but it produced no evidence that he witnessed incidents of torture, nor did it recommend his criminal prosecution. Without giving any hard evidence, she declared that she was ''fairly convinced'' that Wickremesinghe knew in advance that the Tigers were sending a suicide bomber to kill her. She also alleged that her father's assassination had been masterminded by the U.N.P. leader at the time, J.R. Jayewardene -- a view scholars dispute.</p>
        <p>The phone jangled. It was her media minister. They chatted about a letter to her from Wickremesinghe that had been published in a newspaper that day. In it, the opposition leader angrily denied her accusations about his involvement in torture and the assassination attempt on her. ''If there is any substance to your accusations then the police will question and if necessary arrest me,'' he wrote. ''I challenge you to put up or shut up.'' No charges have been brought against him.</p>
        <p>Kumaratunga told her minister to ignore the letter: ''It is absolute lies and the writing of a deranged mind.''</p>
        <p>When she hung up, she promptly went back to savaging the opposition leader. For more than 10 minutes, she described how Wickremesinghe, when he was minister of education 12 years ago, blocked her 5-year-old son's admission to Royal College, an exclusive, government-run school -- a charge Wickremesinghe later denied.</p>
        <p>It is hard to see how Kumaratunga and the U.N.P. will work together after this rancorous election season -- and she does not seem interested in the prospect, anyway. She said she held her tongue about Wickremesinghe until 1998, hoping he would compromise on the constitution, and that had got her nowhere. After Tuesday's elections, in a move that will inevitably bring court challenges, she plans to have Parliament declared a constituent assembly and get the constitution adopted by a simple majority, without U.N.P. support.</p>
        <p>She also seems to have very nearly given up on making a deal to end the war with Velupillai Prabhakaran, the rebel leader of the Tamil Tigers, who is presumed to have dispatched the suicide bomber to kill her. ''Mr. Prabhakaran is mentally ill, seriously,'' she said, adding later, ''The momentum of violence and terror he has begun, he's gotten caught up in the cogwheels of that, and I don't think he can extricate himself.''</p>
        <p>Kumaratunga has interpreted her survival in the suicide bombing as a sign that she has been chosen by the gods to achieve peace, but lately her efforts have brought her only bitter frustration. As she sat at her desk that afternoon in a bright pink sari, railing at the opposition and vowing to go it alone, this stubborn, combative woman who has shown such magnanimity and endured so much pain seemed herself to have become entangled in the cogwheels of Sri Lanka's dead-end politics.</p>
