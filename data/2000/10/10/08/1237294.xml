        <p>Ransacking a site considered sacred by some Jews, hundreds of Palestinians overran the site known as Joseph's Tomb today, hours after it was vacated by Israeli troops. The Palestinians burned the compound and tore it apart with pickaxes, sledgehammers and their bare hands.</p>
        <p>After losing a soldier in a week of intense combat around the site, the Israelis negotiated their own withdrawal and left the compound at about 3 a.m. Palestinian policemen, who were supposed to take over the site, watched as the mob overran the shrine, stepping in to remove the crowd only after it had largely reduced the site to charred rubble.</p>
        <p>Firas al-Amleh, the Palestinian police chief in Nablus, said there was little he could do to stop the raging crowd. ''We lost 18 martyrs here and 170 people were wounded,'' he said of the week of gunbattles around the shrine. ''There are people here who have lost their brothers. What do you expect?''</p>
        <p>Believers say the site is the burial place of Joseph, one of the biblical patriarchs, though numerous historians dispute that it truly holds his remains.</p>
        <p>The tomb, originally a small structure and capped by a white dome, had in recent years become a fortified army outpost protecting Jewish settlers, who set up a yeshiva in the tomb compound. Though Nablus passed to the Palestinian Authority's control in 1995, Israel continued to hold onto the tomb, which has been a source of friction.</p>
        <p>Today many in the crowd asserted that the shrine was actually a Muslim tomb that had served for religious ceremonies before it was taken over by the Israelis years ago. Some said that a mosque should be built on the site, others said a monument to the Palestinians killed in the battle..</p>
        <p>But all celebrated what they considered an armed triumph, a first step, they said, to the liberation of the rest of their country.</p>
        <p>''This is a glorious victory,'' said Ala Taison, a 20-year-old gunman from the armed militia of the Al-Fatah movement, whose members had fought running battles with Israeli troops at the site this week. ''We forced the greatest army in the world to withdraw by force of our weapons. We stood up to their helicopters, tanks and heavy machine guns, and all we had in our hands were Kalashnikov rifles and stones.''</p>
        <p>Palestinian flags and a large green banner of the militant Hamas movement were hoisted over the compound as Fatah gunmen fired celebratory shots in the air. Flashing V-signs, hundreds swarmed over the smoldering remains of the former Israeli enclave, picking it clean and tearing down a building. They vowed to leave nothing to which the Israelis might return.</p>
        <p>A man with a pickaxe pounded at the dome of the building that had housed the settlers' yeshiva. It was now a blackened ruin, and torn pages of Hebrew religious books were strewn on the ground.</p>
        <p>A fortified barracks of Israeli soldiers who had guarded the site was also burned. Cheers went up as a row of concrete barriers lining the perimeter of the outpost was pulled down, and someone announced over a loudspeaker: ''This place has now been liberated!''</p>
        <p>Nasser Badawi, a Fatah gunman from the neighboring Balata refugee camp who stood with a Kalashnikov on shoulder, said that the departure of the Israelis from Joseph's Tomb carried an important message.</p>
        <p>''This proves that the occupation will only leave our lands by force,'' he said. ''The expulsion of the occupation from here is a prelude to its eviction from all Palestinian lands.</p>
        <p>''It is a symbol,'' he said.</p>
