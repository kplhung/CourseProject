        <p>GABRIEL BYRNE was walking past a newsstand one day, with its stacks and stacks of women's magazines, when the idea occurred to him for a television show about a neglected minority: men.</p>
        <p>''I saw this rack of women's magazines, and the topics covered everything from cooking to orgasms,'' Mr. Byrne, the Irish film and stage actor, recalled. ''It made me think about the fact that women are allowed a forum to discuss all kinds of emotional and personal problems, and there doesn't seem to be the same platform for men.''</p>
        <p>Did that mean, he wondered, that ''men don't have the same kind of emotional problems, or is it that the society doesn't encourage them to discuss them?''</p>
        <p>''I thought there was no show on television like that,'' he continued. ''I wanted to do a show about fathers and sons that sounded real.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrne took his notion to a veteran sitcom writer, Cindy Chupack, fresh from the red-hot success of HBO's outrageous girl-talk hit ''Sex and the City,'' and before long he had his platform. ''Madigan Men,'' a male bastion of a comedy about three generations of Irish fathers and sons struggling with such quintessential guy hang-ups as how to express affection and how to meet women's (and one another's) demands for some kind of genuine intimacy, was scheduled to have its premiere Friday night at 9:30 on ABC.</p>
        <p>The half-hour show, Mr. Byrne's first foray into series television, may not have been the most likely next step for an actor known for his frequently praised work in serious movies (''Miller's Crossing'') and serious theater (''A Moon for the Misbegotten''). In fact, ''Madigan Men,'' which is taped in New York and for which Mr. Byrne serves as an executive producer, is almost as much a product of the stage as of television. The dialogue in the gentle one-on-one scenes in the early installments of the series often beats to the low-key slice-of-life rhythms of an Off Broadway play.</p>
        <p>And it should escape the notice of no diehard theatergoer that the actor playing Mr. Byrne's Irish, proverb-spinning father, Roy Dotrice, was also his co-star in the Broadway revival of Eugene O'Neill's ''Moon for the Misbegotten'' that closed this summer. Their swift transfer together from stage to screen -- they even taped the pilot in Queens during the Broadway run -- is something of a television anomaly.</p>
        <p>''We opened first in Chicago with 'Moon,' and one day Gabriel and I were chatting,'' Mr. Dotrice recalled. ''He said, I have this idea for three generations of Irish men: would you be interested in playing my father?'' As it happened, Mr. Dotrice, who is English, was portraying another Gaelic father in ''Moon,'' the conniving Phil Hogan, a part that won him a Tony Award in June as best featured actor in a play.</p>
        <p>The rapport between Mr. Byrne and Mr. Dotrice set the tone for the warmth that the producers and writers are attempting to make a defining characteristic of ''Madigan Men.'' But whether such a show can thrive in an age when high camp is the order of the night in prime-time comedy -- with NBC's Emmy-winning ''Will and Grace'' and Fox's ''Malcolm in the Middle'' setting the caffeinated, crack-a-minute pace -- is the question taunting and tantalizing the show's creators.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to make it much more character-driven,'' Ms. Chupack said. It is a red-flag term that is sometimes translated by network executives to mean ''not very funny.'' Ms. Chupack added: ''We do have an ongoing battle convincing the network to trust us, that if we have a moment that's serious, that people will stick with us.''</p>
        <p>''Madigan Men'' revolves around the all-male household presided over by Ben Madigan (Mr. Byrne), a New York architect, who lives with his teenage son (John C. Hensley) and his recently arrived father, Mr. Dotrice, who plays Seamus Madigan as a sunny, flip-side version of the monstrous patriarch detailed in Frank McCourt's ''Angela's Ashes.'' In the style of home-and-workplace shows like ''Frasier,'' Mr. Byrne's sitcom alternates between the Madigan clan's comfy Manhattan apartment and the confines of his architectural firm, where his colleagues include a hapless partner who has no luck with the ladies (Grant Shaud), and a secretary (Sabrina Lloyd) who sees the rakish (and divorced) character played by Mr. Byrne as the last, best hope for single women in the city.</p>
        <p>The structure appears to be right out of the sitcom manual: initial episodes explore Madigan's dating vicissitudes and his tense relations with his ex-wife's new boyfriend. The only truly unconventional aspect of ''Madigan Men'' is Mr. Byrne, with his hangdog good looks and idiosyncratic charm. ''Gabriel is not stand up-comic funny, not on-the-beat funny,'' said Barnet Kellman, who has directed several early episodes of ''Madigan Men'' and is perhaps best known for his work on ''Murphy Brown,'' another sitcom that brought to the television fore an actress, Candice Bergen, who had not been at the top of anyone's list of potential sitcom stars.</p>
        <p>THE show is clearly banking on the offbeat charisma of Mr. Byrne, who was born 50 years ago in Dublin and has lived in the United States for a decade. (He is divorced from the actress Ellen Barkin, with whom he has two children.) During the taping of an episode at the Kaufman studios in Astoria, Queens, last month, Mr. Byrne appeared in every scene, and his line readings confirmed Mr. Kellman's assessment: despite the exhortations of a comic hired to keep the audience alert during the scenic changeovers (''Have fun! Lots of energy!'' he implored), the audience often had trouble manufacturing the collective waves of guffaws the set-ups seemed to require.</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrne acknowledges a lack of affinity for the sitcom genre. ''I just didn't watch them,'' he said. ''I never saw an episode of 'Seinfeld,' and I don't mean it in any pretentious way. The last one I saw that I really loved was 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show.' ''</p>
        <p>While it is easy to see the influence of that landmark ensemble show in the familial ambience of ''Madigan Men,'' it remains to be seen whether Mr. Byrne's approach translates over the long haul as freshness or as naivete. As the cast and crew know, the show's fate now rests with the legions of real television veterans, the Nielsen families. ''It's a game of nerves as this point,'' Mr. Kellman said.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Byrne says he feels both exhilarated and terrified. He recalls what James Burrows, who directed the program's pilot, told him: ''Say good-bye to your anonymity.'' But in manly fashion, Mr. Byrne is trying to keep his emotions in check.</p>
        <p>''If it works I'll be very happy,'' he said. ''And if it doesn't work, at least I tried to say something that's a little bit different.''</p>
