        <p>Two new books -- The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce,'' by Judith S. Wallerstein, Julia M. Lewis and Sandra Blakeslee, and ''The Case for Marriage,'' by Linda J. Waite and Maggie Gallagher -- have renewed the debate over the once-scandalous, now commonplace phenomenon of divorce. The first study suggests that children of divorce suffer more than we suspect, and the second suggests that the long-term benefits of staying together are greater than we realize. To those who choose to end their marriages, of course, sociological analyses are irrelevant; it is always a personal decision, and usually a painful one. Most who make that choice do so just a few years after marriage. But the seven people featured on these pages spent decades together before parting ways. One couple fell victim to infidelity, another came apart when one spouse realized he wasn't who he thought he was, a third simply drifted apart. Yet another -- overshadowed by the demands of work -- later managed to reconcile. Here, they talk frankly about why they made such a radical change after so many years together.</p>
        <p>Kay Canupp  ''I was very devoted to my husband, but I didn't recognize his faults. He came home one Friday night and said, 'Have you ever been attracted to anyone else?' I always remember that it was two days after the explosion of the space shuttle. It just seemed like my life exploded too.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'I know it's wrong, can you forgive me?' I thought it was a midlife crisis. But the reason he was so despondent was that it had ended. And soon I started seeing signs that he was picking up with another woman. They eventually married.</p>
        <p>''A week after they were married, I discovered I had breast cancer. Then I met a gentleman, and we married. We would drive to the arboretum and look at the moon, sit for hours and enjoy each other's company. And then I lost him, this July, to cancer.</p>
        <p>''I had 24 years the first time, only 2 1/2 years this time. I've often thought that divorce is worse than death. Losing Charles -- as painful as it is, I have so many memories. With divorce, there's betrayal and every negative emotion you can think of.''</p>
        <p>Dan and Barb  Dan: ''For the first few years, things were great between us. But then after 18 years, things changed. She said hurtful things: she couldn't depend on me financially, she didn't love me the way she had when we first married. Meanwhile, her career was exploding. The lowest point was her company Christmas party last year. I couldn't talk to her all night. When we went out to the car, Barb was quiet, and then she said, 'That's the worst night I've ever had.' And I said, 'I don't know how to be with you anymore.' I moved out for several months. But we worked it out, with counseling and help from our kids. I'm happy now. Is it perfect? No. But I love her. And I don't think the grass is greener anywhere else.''  Barb: ''We started out our marriage as equals: financially, professionally. But what can happen in a lot of marriages is that over time you become event planners: you get things done, as opposed to having a relationship. In my work community, I was constantly stimulated and given lots of rewards, and you feed on that. Home wasn't as exciting. But deep down, I didn't like what I'd become.</p>
        <p>''When Dan left, it was like having a two-by-four hit me over the head. I had always known that I wanted to grow old with him. That's the loss I felt most: just traveling, and spending time, and being together. It took a lot of time to put things back together. We're moving into a new home together this week. In our new house, we've made separate space for ourselves. But we made the decisions together.''</p>
        <p>Julia Fesperman and John Fesperman  John: ''We moved a lot, and during all that time she gave up career opportunities so mine could expand. In 1980, our daughter was born. I think that was one of the things that held us together: sometimes children tend to cement marriages so that they last longer than they would have otherwise. But over time, it was just a distancing in our relationship. Every time I read these studies about divorce and children, what I see so many times is that the parents end up in battles with each other; the kids become a pawn. We didn't do that. And when it was over, there wasn't anything worth us having a tremendous battle over, so we ended the relationship in a friendly manner, instead of spending it all on attorneys. It has helped us today. We still go to the same church. I guess if you have to have a divorce, it was as good a divorce as you can have.''  Julia: ''I see older couples -- they look at each other, and they know what each other is thinking. That's a level of intimacy that could never exist between John and me. When you block off parts of yourself, it's like closing off a room in a house. No one can have access. It's lonelier than being alone. I still can't talk about it. ''He did not want the divorce. But he was not willing to make things healthy, and I was not willing to live with that. It was more painful to me than the death of my parents. When you put two people together, and you rip them apart, you truly rip them apart: they keep a piece of you, you keep a piece of them.''</p>
        <p>Tom S. and Anne S.  Tom: ''Where I grew up, you just couldn't just take off to New York City and be gay. So I decided I could put all of that behind me. We were married for 23 years. But I became terrified of being exposed. I was thinking of committing suicide. I hoped Anne would divorce me. Finally, there was a confrontation. Anne and I had this dinner with our closest friends, a couple, and they were asking questions: Did you have an affair? Is there another woman? Is there another guy? He said, 'Are you gay?' And I said yes. It was a huge, huge relief.</p>
        <p>''In a way, I was lucky. A lot of the gay men who would have been my peers have died. But it would have been great to have been true to myself. I wouldn't have lived a lie, wouldn't have put other people through this lie. But then, I still say I didn't lie to her, I loved her with all of my heart -- as much as my heart was capable of loving a woman.''  Anne: ''There were times when I suspected it. Your heart knows something, and your head says, That's not logical -- I have three kids! At one point, he got really involved with this guy. I saw them -- and I'd think, they were drunk, they were just hugging. What I wanted to believe was what he told me. There were a lot of good years that, if he hadn't lied to me, wouldn't have happened. But there's a certain amount of betrayal that you can't deny.</p>
        <p>''If there's any anger, it's not about him being gay, it's about his relationship with the kids. He was really good with our children when they were little, but as the children got older it got more and more difficult for Tom to be involved in their lives. He had his own struggle going on. I think he's become more selfish, but maybe I just didn't know him.''</p>
