        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>THUNDER FROM THE EAST: Portrait of a Rising Asia, by Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. (Knopf, $27.50.) A highly circumstantial report on Asia that expects a glorious future for the continent as the world power center; by two staff members of The New York Times who both did duty as Times correspondents in Asia.</p>
        <p>THE MISSIONARY AND THE LIBERTINE: Love and War in East and West, by Ian Buruma. (Random House, $25.95.) Essays by a skilled interpreter of East and West; the West's view, he finds, is still largely shaped by stereotypes, while in fact East is no longer all that different from West, though Asian political figures find it helpful to pretend it is.</p>
        <p>THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER &amp; CLAY, by Michael Chabon. (Random House, $26.95.) A generous, optimistic, inventive and ambitious comic novel, set in the golden age of comic books (late 1930's to early 50's) and thematically permeated by two ideas: escape (from Nazism, from Brooklyn) and the mystery of the golem of Prague.</p>
        <p>THE TALMUD AND THE INTERNET: A Journey Between Worlds, by Jonathan Rosen. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $16.) A thought-provoking essay on two information systems, both of which are full of unforeseen linkages and contain all knowledge, if you know how to find it.</p>
        <p>THE INFORMANT: A True Story, by Kurt Eichenwald. (Broadway, $26.) The author, a reporter for The Times, makes clear and concise the complexities of the 1990's price-fixing scandal at Archer Daniels Midland, the feed makers, and the fascinating part played in the affair by a government informant whose core of truth was surrounded by a truly baroque architecture of lies.</p>
        <p>WHEN WE WERE ORPHANS, by Kazuo Ishiguro. (Knopf, $25.) A novel that conceals great issues of identity and self-knowledge behind the facade of a detective story; its protagonist, a private eye in 1920's London, uses all his wits in the cause of deceiving himself, missing the call of freedom in the blindness his sense of obligation imposes.</p>
        <p>THE COLLECTED POEMS, by Stanley Kunitz. (Norton, $27.95.) The life's work of the new poet laureate of the United States, now 95; much of it thematically and structurally interconnected, bold and generous in its statements about birth, death and the cosmos.</p>
        <p>THE UNEXPECTED LEGACY OF DIVORCE: A 25 Year Landmark Study, by Judith Wallerstein, Julia Lewis and Sandra Blakeslee. (Hyperion, $24.95.) The unexpected was this: The toll divorce takes on children lasts well into adulthood; for example, only 40 percent of 1971's children in the study have ever married, less than half the figure for the general population.</p>
        <p>THE MAP OF LOVE, by Ahdaf Soueif. (Anchor, paper, $14.) Three women in nearly two centuries intersect in this novel as an American and an Egyptian make the loves and the politics of the past transpire from a trunk left by a late Victorian Englishwoman.</p>
