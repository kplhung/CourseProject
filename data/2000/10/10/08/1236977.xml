        <p>EVEN statistics showing natural gas pipelines as the safest way to transport energy don't ease the worries of Neil Miller, a homeowner in Ossining.</p>
        <p>His three-bedroom house is less than 50 feet from a proposed pipeline through Westchester, and Mr. Miller said that despite figures from the federal Department of Transportation, he's not sleeping well at night.</p>
        <p>''If that pipeline ever cracks, for whatever reason, which way do you think the gas will go?'' said Mr. Miller, who is one of more than 5,000 residents objecting to Columbia Gas Transmission's proposal to lay a section of a 442-mile pipeline along parts of Route 9 and Route 9A, from Cortlandt south to Mount Pleasant. ''Of course, my house and my family will be affected.''</p>
        <p>Alfredo Mendez and his wife, Michele, are similarly troubled by that section of the Millennium Pipeline Project, designed to transport up to 700 million cubic feet of natural gas a day to East Coast markets. Columbia, based in Fairfax, Va., had originally planned to put the pipeline in northern Westchester along the sparsely populated Consolidated Edison Company's right of way, but the public utility objected, saying it was worried about the safety of its overhead transmission lines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mendez, whose backyard would now be 75 feet from the new section of the proposed gas transmission line, said: ''We're very angry that anyone could consider putting down a pipeline of this magnitude so close to private homes. Accidents happen.''</p>
        <p>As Supervisor John V. Chervokas of Ossining explained, the opposition to the Route 9A section of the pipeline amounts to ''a lot more than just a not-in-my-backyard reaction.''</p>
        <p>''We all see the need for alternative energy sources,'' Mr. Chervokas said, observing that proponents of natural gas -- including many environmentalists -- recognize it as the largest single new source of energy for the New York region since the 1950's. It is also a far cleaner fuel than coal for running the turbines that generate electricity.</p>
        <p>''The uproar is that this latest proposal for the pipeline poses a significant risk for many residents,'' Mr. Chervokas said. ''If it's unsafe under power lines, what does that mean for the people who will be living near it?''</p>
        <p>Under the proposal, which has been submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Columbia, a consortium that includes TransCanada Pipelines, Westcoast Energy and M.C.N. Energy Group, the $650 million pipeline would enter the United States from Canada at Lake Erie and travel through New York State and Pennsylvania, with about 22.7 miles threading through Westchester.</p>
        <p>Asked whether the federal government will consider residents' concerns about the pipeline -- more than 500 attended a public hearing on the matter last month in Croton-on-Hudson -- Tamara Young-Allen, a spokeswoman for the regulatory commission, said that many pipeline proposals are contentious and are still approved. As examples, she cited the 400-mile Independence Pipeline Project from Defiance, Ohio, to Leidy, Pa., and the SupplyLink Project by ANR Pipeline Company of Detroit for 72 miles through Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio.</p>
        <p>''Our decision will be based on facts, not feelings,'' she said. ''The commission will weigh the benefits of the project against the potentially adverse aspects, and if the benefits outweigh the negatives, we'll go with it.''</p>
        <p>Still, Michael B. Kaplowitz, chairman of the County Board of Legislators' Environment Committee, remained optimistic that the public's objections would prevail.</p>
        <p>''I have to hope F.E.R.C. would take into account public concern about this issue and reconsider the Con Ed right of way,'' said Mr. Kaplowitz, a Democrat who represents Cortlandt, Croton, and parts of Somers and Yorktown.</p>
        <p>Members of a group called 9 and 9NAY, a coalition opposing the revised pipeline proposal, say that part of the Millennium Pipeline would be under the heavily traveled roadway, where it would be susceptible to damage during road maintenance and repair. Coalition members also say that the Indian Point evacuation route, intended to be used in case of an accident at the nuclear power plants in Buchanan, will be disrupted while the pipeline is being laid.</p>
        <p>The opposition further argues that neither the federal government nor  Columbia Gas Transmission has conducted analyses of traffic patterns, including lane closings and tie-ups that could occur while the pipeline is being installed.</p>
        <p>Columbia has said that its procedures take safety concerns into consideration, adding that along the 13,000 miles of pipeline that it oversees no nonworkers have been killed in more than 50 years of operation.</p>
        <p>Also, Columbia says that the Millennium Pipeline Project will use a robotic internal monitoring device known as a ''smart pig,'' which patrols the inside of the pipeline. Moreover, Columbia says that corrosion, previously a threat to pipelines, has been minimized in recent years through the widespread use of pipeline coatings and similar protections.</p>
        <p>Brent Archer, a spokesman for Columbia, said the government's draft environmental study on the Millennium proposal is not expected until after Jan. 1. The final environmental impact statement and the regulatory commission's decision would follow a public comment period early next year.</p>
