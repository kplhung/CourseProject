        <p>TWO high school seniors have taken their seats this year on the 11-member state Board of Education. Jennifer Santiago, who attends Wilbur Cross High School in New Haven, and David Agrawal, a student at Rockville High School in Vernon, can't vote, but they are privy to the workings of the governmental body.</p>
        <p>''I think it's an honor to sit down with people who have a say over Connecticut schools,'' Ms. Santiago said.</p>
        <p>This is the third year that students have been appointed to one-year terms on the board. They join adult members who serve four-year terms. The arrangement was initiated by a student on the 30-member Student Advisory Council to the state board, who had heard about a movement around the country to appoint students to state and local boards of education. He met with state Senator Kevin B. Sullivan, a Democrat from West Hartford, and got the support of the Student Advisory Council for a bill to create student representation at the state level. It passed in the General Assembly in 1998.</p>
        <p>''There was some discussion and debate about voting rights,'' said Thomas Murphy, a spokesman for the state Board of Education. He said the decision to bar students from voting stemmed from the nature of some of the board's responsibilities -- such as budget and policy decisions that could subject members to lobbying by interest groups; and discussing and voting on personnel matters that could result in litigation, such as revocation of teacher certifications.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy added that some members of the Student Advisory Council felt they already represented fellow students on policy issues, and were worried that selecting only two students to sit on the board would decrease, not increase, student influence. He said the group met with Gov. John G. Rowland and the commissioner of education, Theodore Sergi; they agreed that the council would have a key role in choosing the student representatives and would advise them once they took office. It would also continue its direct advisory role to government leaders. Mr. Murphy said the group has discussed issues of critical interest to students, such as segregation and diversity, harassment, homework policies, student citizenship and responsibilities, and school violence and security.</p>
        <p>School principals nominate students for the Student Advisory Council, and the education commissioner appoints the members. By law, the council must be balanced by gender, race, ethnicity and economic status. Created more than a decade ago, it must include students from each Congressional district in the state and students with disabilities.</p>
        <p>Students who would like to serve on the state board apply to the Student Advisory Council, which conducts interviews and recommends five finalists; the governor selects two. The law states that two students be appointed, with no other specifications. Even without a mandate, in each of the past three years one male and one female have been appointed, from a broad geographic mix representing urban, suburban and rural districts and ethnic diversity that has included whites, Asian-Americans and Hispanics.</p>
        <p>Eleven states have student representatives to their boards of education, according to David Kysilko, publication director of the National Association of State Boards of Education. In California, Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont, the student members vote. The trend to include student representatives began a dozen years ago, Mr. Kysilko said, adding that the number of states to do so is growing slowly. His organization supports such efforts, because the response has been so positive from students and adult board members, he said.</p>
        <p>At the first regular board meeting Ms. Santiago and Mr. Agrawal attended, on Sept. 13, one of the topics was proposed changes to the Connecticut Mastery Test. Ms. Santiago said the meeting was ''very organized but kind of overwhelming.'' She said some people spoke in favor of emphasizing grammar more on the state tests, while others opposed that change for fear of curtailing students' creativity. The board is expected to vote on any changes in the Mastery Test at its next meeting.</p>
        <p>Ms. Santiago said she just listened at her first meeting without expressing her own opinions. She said at first she didn't feel comfortable, because it was a new setting, ''and I didn't know how accepting other board members would be about our opinions.'' She felt more comfortable by the meeting's end, she added.</p>
        <p>As for the student representatives' lack of voting privileges, she said: ''I think it doesn't matter that we can't vote. Some issues are so complicated, like teacher certification, we are probably better off not voting.''</p>
        <p>Marcel LaFlamme disagrees. He was the student representative last year to the Massachusetts Board of Education, where he enjoyed full voting rights -- which he said were critical to his equal participation on the board.</p>
        <p>In 1974, the Massachusetts legislature established a statewide Student Advisory Council, with the chair of that group serving as a voting member of the State Board.</p>
        <p>''There is only one student member on the Board each year, although the extensive network of state and regional Student Advisory Councils provides ample opportunity for the chair to consult with other student leaders,'' said Mr. LaFlamme, who is now a freshman at Harvard.</p>
        <p>He doesn't think much of the Connecticut arrangement, which he said lacks respect for students' abilities to understand complicated matters. As for the concern about lawsuits, Mr. LaFlamme said that, as a member of the 1999-2000 Massachusetts Board of Education, ''I am in fact being sued by teachers' unions on the basis of statewide exit exams and diagnostic content exams for teachers whose students have low math scores. Doesn't bother me. I'm proud to stand up with my colleagues for important, difficult decisions we made.''</p>
        <p>Having students on the board has been good for everyone , according to government officials and the students themselves.</p>
        <p>''For the young people it's a great honor,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''In schools, we separate people by age, and here we have a real-world experience where students interact with adults around issues that affect their world. The students develop study skills -- from all the material they have to read -- and debating skills.''</p>
        <p>He considers the teenagers who have served ''brilliant. They're articulate and bring a lot to the table.'' He added that of the first four representatives, two went on to Harvard, one to Yale and one to Trinity College.</p>
        <p>As for the adults on the board, Mr. Murphy said, ''They've been inspired by the success of the students. Many times you focus only on the problems in public education. This gave them a chance to renew their faith that public education is working. They also felt a better connection to the classroom and the impact their policies have on students.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Agrawal said he has found adults on the local and state boards to be ''good at listening to other people's opinions, even if they don't agree with them.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Santiago plans to major in criminal justice and political science in college and hopes to be a lawyer. Mr. Agrawal said he plans to go into law or government service. They both have goals for their tenure on the board.</p>
        <p>Ms. Santiago said, ''I hope to focus on closing gaps between students, helping lower-level students move up to a higher level and promoting more interaction between different groups of students.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Agrawal previously served on his town's board of education, where he said he learned about educational policy and procedure. He said on the state board he would like to focus on ''maximizing student opportunity through smaller classes, technology, more challenging courses and more electives.''</p>
