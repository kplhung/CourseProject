        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In referring to political debates as ''bouts'' in his article about the PBS special ''Debating Our Destiny: Forty Years of Presidential Debates,'' R. W. Apple Jr. does a disservice to fighters, who comply with formal and informal rules ensuring fair play and respect for their opponents that most American politicians would flout [''Where American Politics Becomes a Televised Sport,'' Sept. 24]. And such a comparison also contributes to the coarsening of political life and to the demise of democratic accountability.</p>
        <p>Debates should not be bouts judged by journalists who act as ''the semi-official scorers.'' They should be opportunities for candidates to engage in colloquies that both clarify and distinguish their positions on critical issues. But candidates know that the media prefer quick jabs to nuanced discussions of complex ideas that cannot be reduced to 15-second sound-bites. The result is vacuous exchanges that diminish voters' ability to predict how each candidate would govern.</p>
        <p>Mr. Apple's lament that candidates' determination ''to stay 'on message' '' prevents ''genuine clashes of ideas'' during debates is reminiscent of Herbert Hoover's frustration with Americans' unwillingness to ''work'' themselves out of the Great Depression. Perhaps Mr. Apple and his colleagues should first assess their own practices before they blame candidates for the current poverty of substantive political discourse in the United States.</p>
