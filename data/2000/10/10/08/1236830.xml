        <p>MARTIN BAUMAN</p>
        <p>Or, A Sure Thing.</p>
        <p>By David Leavitt.</p>
        <p>387 pp. Boston:</p>
        <p>Houghton Mifflin Company. $26.</p>
        <p>BOOKS are among the many things that can be compared to the proverbial sausage: you're better off not seeing how they're made. Starry-eyed initiates arrive in New York expecting to find writers and editors who spend their hours in elevated literary conversation, only to discover, as the eponymous narrator of David Leavitt's new novel does, that the most common parlance is ''I've heard. . . .'' Martin Bauman himself soon adopts ''this seemingly innocuous, ultimately pernicious little phrase . . . 'I've heard she's a really bad writer.' 'I've heard she got a huge advance for her last book, but the publisher was disappointed by the sales.' 'I've heard he's always trying to seduce his women students.' ''As Martin sees it, ''all anyone did was gnaw at the bones of hearsay and hindsight.''</p>
        <p>The story of Martin's years in the New York literary world closely resembles that of his creator: a young man from the provinces (in Martin's case, Seattle; Leavitt grew up in Palo Alto, Calif.), raised to revere The New Yorker, who becomes, while still in college, the first writer to publish a short story with an openly gay theme in that magazine. A fairly well-received collection and a less-well-received novel follow, accompanied by Martin's induction into a world of gossiping, backbiting, competitive writers and venal, pandering publishers. He, along with his writerly cohort, finds himself the subject of an article in a glossy magazine, entitled (in a gleeful vamp on Esquire headlines) ''Invasion of the Prestige Snatchers: The Nouvelle Vague of Young Writers and Where It Hangs Out'' -- the kind of press that becomes, for Martin, ''both the making and unmaking of my career.''</p>
        <p>Through it all, Martin intermittently pines for the approval of Stanley Flint, the imperious, uncompromising editor and writing teacher whose spell the young man first falls under in college. (''Martin Bauman'' is a veritable ''Where's Waldo?'' of thinly fictionalized literary figures from the 1980's; Flint is Gordon Lish, who taught at Yale when Leavitt was there as an undergraduate.) But Flint's praise is hard to come by, for while he recognizes that Martin has talent, he also warns the boy: ''You are eminently corruptible. . . . It's easy for me to imagine you turning into a hack, settling for cheap success, and not because you're greedy, but because you desire too desperately to please.''</p>
        <p>Flint has Martin's number, but he could not upbraid his acolyte any more fiercely than the present-day Martin does. Having got over it all, the middle-aged Martin narrates the novel from an unspecified place ''as far from New York as you can get, amid patient cultivations, on an unpaved road where the only traffic is caused by passing flocks of sheep.'' (Leavitt now lives in Italy.) ''Martin Bauman'' gives every appearance of being an extended, merciless excoriation of Leavitt's younger self -- depicted here as a boy with a propensity for cheating on exams, a coddled yet chronically needy child-man not above betraying the people he loves when they prove insufficiently forthcoming with their reassurance. The novel is in part a catalog of sins, from Martin's attempt to get Flint fired after the older man dismisses his novel as ''just paper with little black marks on it'' to his ''mendacity'' in writing himself into a scene depicting his mother's death, when in fact he was off sulking with his boyfriend during the actual event.</p>
        <p>This spectacle -- the accolade-hungry A student (''I didn't go to college to learn; I went to college to achieve'') engaged in a project of rigorous self-abasement -- gives ''Martin Bauman'' a tangy frisson. It also provides a balance to the precision-tooled edge with which Leavitt depicts his literary friends and associates. Of the above-mentioned boyfriend, Eli, he writes, ''He'd read Alice Miller's 'The Drama of the Gifted Child,' and it had set him off for life, authorizing his rage, which was both relentless and lacerating.'' Eli's best friend, Liza, is a precocious young writer whose self-regard is unwavering, while her sexual orientation remains in a state of constant flux. She shares with Martin a ''cult of childhood she had taken such pains, both in her writing and her life, to foster,'' celebrated by a regressive wallowing in pop culture that makes them ''voluptuaries of the Spaghetti-O, epicures of 'Room 222,' connoisseurs of 'Airport 1975.' ''</p>
        <p>The unfolding of the Martin-Eli-Liza triangle adds a dash of soap to the proceedings, and the result is brisk, shrewd and eminently readable, although things do bog down a bit as Martin and Eli break up or when Leavitt indulges his penchant for clause-heavy Jamesian sentences. It's only the novel's very conclusion -- an epiphanic realization that seems better suited to a short story -- that disappoints. Flint publishes an acclaimed novel (in this, his career differs notably from Lish's), and Martin attends a reading where a revelation about Flint's past allows him to see that his former teacher is also driven by ''the longing of those who have been hated for what they are to be loved for what they have made.'' In short, underneath his daunting exterior, Flint is a writer, a petitioner for attention, like any other of Martin's friends.</p>
        <p>However, he isn't. For of all the dozen or so writers Leavitt skewers in ''Martin Bauman,'' Flint is the only one who is also, equally, a reader. Martin is more typical when he describes how he ''thumbed through'' a colleague's novel ''in that way of literary New Yorkers'' -- that is, by examining the author photo, checking to see who blurbed the book and scanning the dedication, the acknowledgments and finally the copyright page, the only kind of reading he seems to do. While intimately acquainted with the advances and sales of his friends' books, he barely troubles himself to mention their contents. Even when handed Flint's own opus, a potential key to his idol's mysteries, Martin merely skims it in search of the character based on himself.</p>
        <p>To Martin it's hardly conceivable that Flint should have some other reason for writing than to salve a psychic wound with public recognition. The possibility that Flint, having taken great joy from the world of books, might wish to return the favor is beyond his student's ken. The pettiness of writers is so disheartening because, at its best, the experience of reading is so sublime; naturally, we expect better of the people who can engineer such a miracle. That Leavitt depicts his own generation of ''hot'' young writers as not just preoccupied with reputation but also apparently indifferent to the alchemy of reading itself may be the most damning thing of all.</p>
