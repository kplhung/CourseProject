        <p>With many parents citing the threat of AIDS, a recent survey by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation has found overwhelming support among parents for sex education in America's high schools. A strong majority of parents surveyed wanted schools to cover not just the biology of reproduction and the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases, but also issues like abortion and sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>The findings also did not divide neatly between those who favor teaching abstinence until marriage, and those who favor comprehensive sex education.</p>

        <p>The findings also did not divide neatly between those who favor teaching abstinence until marriage, and those who favor comprehensive sex education.</p>
        <p>The advocates of abstinence want contraception mentioned only as an ineffective way to prevent pregnancy and disease, while comprehensive education often gives information without firm rules for behavior. In this survey, however, parents said schools should stress abstinence but at the same time teach about using condoms and contraceptives.</p>
