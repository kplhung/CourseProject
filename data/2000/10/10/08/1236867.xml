        <p>HOTEL  Manhattan Tee Times</p>
        <p>Plenty of hotels offer golf packages, but how many of them are in Manhattan?

The hotel's plan, starting at $345 a night Sunday to Thursday and $305 weekends, includes accommodations, a one-hour private lesson with a PGA instructor, video swing analysis, reservations at a driving stall and up to 125 balls at the range. The hotel is at Park Avenue and 38th Street; Chelsea Piers is on the Hudson at 23rd Street. Information and reservations: (877) 993-6725.</p>
