        <p>ITALIAN cooking is about letting ingredients speak for themselves. This light autumn dinner begins with a classic antipasto: fresh figs with prosciutto. But the figs are served in a salad made with chunks of buffalo mozzarella and whole basil leaves, sprinkled with a light lemon olive oil vinaigrette. The salad is arranged in the center of a serving platter, surrounded by thin slices of prosciutto. It's an unusual combination, but it works. You can use regular mozzarella, but the tangy taste of mozzarella made from the milk of water buffalo is even better, and it must be very fresh.</p>
        <p>The main course is a large bowl of steaming mussels served in a thick, garlicky tomato and white-wine sauce with fresh corn. A few anchovies are melted into the sauce (their taste alters completely when they are cooked), making it richer and more complex. The sauce is sopped up with grilled croutons of Italian country bread.</p>

        <p>ITALIAN cooking is about letting ingredients speak for themselves. This light autumn dinner begins with a classic antipasto: fresh figs with prosciutto. But the figs are served in a salad made with chunks of buffalo mozzarella and whole basil leaves, sprinkled with a light lemon olive oil vinaigrette. The salad is arranged in the center of a serving platter, surrounded by thin slices of prosciutto. It's an unusual combination, but it works. You can use regular mozzarella, but the tangy taste of mozzarella made from the milk of water buffalo is even better, and it must be very fresh.</p>
        <p>The main course is a large bowl of steaming mussels served in a thick, garlicky tomato and white-wine sauce with fresh corn. A few anchovies are melted into the sauce (their taste alters completely when they are cooked), making it richer and more complex. The sauce is sopped up with grilled croutons of Italian country bread.</p>
        <p>Even though mussels are extremely inexpensive, Americans have never taken to them in a big way for cooking at home, probably because they think the mussels will be a chore to prepare. But now that mussels are grown on wooden stakes on farms they are clean and uniform in size. Most of the ones on the market are from Maine, with smooth black and silver shells, or from New Zealand, green lip mussels, which are also very clean. All mussels should be rinsed under cold running water, and the little beard on the side of the shell (if there is one) should be removed. Discard any mussels with broken shells and any that feel light for their weight or fail to close when you tap them.</p>
        <p>To end the dinner, there is a quintessential fall dessert, a tart made with Italian prune plums.</p>
        <p>Dark purple, with a meaty flesh, these plums are in season until the end of October. They are baked in a pastry shell and served warm with a marsala glaze, accompanied by vanilla ice cream.</p>
        <p>A glass of chilled moscato wine would go down well with this dessert.</p>
        <p>Figs With Basil, Mozzarella And Prosciutto  Total time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>1 pound prosciutto, sliced thin  2 pints ripe green or purple figs  2 containers fresh buffalo mozzarella  1 bunch basil  1 lemon</p>
        <p>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Arrange the prosciutto slices on a large platter, leaving space in the middle for the figs and mozzarella. Cut the stems off the figs and cut them in half or quarters. Arrange them in the center of the platter. Cut the cheese into chunks about one and a half inches square, put them among the figs and sprinkle with basil leaves.</p>
        <p>2. Combine the juice of the lemon to taste with the olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the mixture over the figs, mozzarella and basil just before serving.  Yield: 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Mussels With Tomatoes, White Wine and Corn  Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>1 large onion, chopped fine</p>
        <p>1/4 cup olive oil  4 cloves garlic, minced  6 anchovies, chopped  4 cups canned plum tomatoes, chopped  1 cup flat-leaf parsley, minced, plus leaves for garnishing</p>
        <p>1/4 cup fresh oregano, minced  1 cup dry white wine  8 pounds mussels  5 ears corn  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper  1 loaf Italian country bread  1 clove garlic, cut in half.</p>
        <p>1. In a heavy saucepan, soften the onion in the olive oil. Add the garlic and anchovies and cook until the garlic is soft and the anchovies have dissolved. Add the tomatoes, parsley, oregano and wine. Simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, stirring frequently.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, rinse and de-beard the mussels. They should be pretty clean. Discard any that have cracked or open shells. Shuck the corn and, using a sharp knife, scrape the kernels into a bowl. All this can be done ahead of time.</p>
        <p>3. Preheat grill or broiler. Cut the bread into slices on the bias. Brush with olive oil and rub with garlic. Grill or broil on both sides. Put on a napkin in a basket.</p>
        <p>4. Cook the mussels in three batches. Put about a cup of the tomato sauce in a pot large enough to hold at least three pounds of mussels. Add a batch of mussels and cook them, covered, shaking the pan from time to time, until they open (about five minutes). Remove them with a slotted spoon to a large bowl and keep them warm in a low oven.</p>
        <p>5. Pour the cooking juices into the saucepan with the remaining sauce, bring them to a boil and reduce over a moderate flame while you cook the next batch of mussels. When the mussels are done, put them in the bowl with the others and add the cooking liquid to the saucepan. Reduce the sauce over high heat until it is fairly thick, then add the corn. Cook two to three minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and pour the sauce over the mussels in the serving bowl. Sprinkle with remaining parsley leaves and serve at once with the croutons passed separately.  Yield: 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Plum Tart With Marsala Glaze  Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>2 pounds ripe Italian prune plums  1 10- to 11-inch shortcrust pastry shell, unbaked and chilled  6 tablespoons sugar  1 inch-long vanilla bean  1 tablespoon lemon juice</p>
        <p>1/2 cup marsala wine</p>
        <p>1/2 cup water.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. Cut the plums in half and remove the pits. Slice the halves into thirds. Arrange them on a pastry shell in a circle, letting the slices overlap slightly and sprinkle with three tablespoons sugar. Put the tart in the oven and bake 15 minutes, then turn the heat down to 375 degrees. Bake 30 to 40 minutes more, until the pastry is golden brown and the plums are tender.</p>
        <p>3. Meanwhile, simmer the remaining sugar, vanilla bean, lemon juice, marsala and water in a small saucepan over moderate heat until you have a thick glaze (about 15 to 20 minutes). Remove the tart from the oven and, when it has cooled for five minutes, pour the warm glaze over the plums. Serve the tart warm with vanilla ice cream.  Yield: 8 servings.</p>
