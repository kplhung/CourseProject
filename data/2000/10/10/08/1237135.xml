        <p>IN the security business, there is a technical term for the Muslim rebel kidnappers of the southern Philippines, draped in new gold chains, conspicuous in pristine Nike sneakers and Ray Ban sunglasses, racing around on -- and often falling off -- their new motorcycles. The term is ''decadent guerrillas.''</p>
        <p>Having taken their remote region's age-old avocation of kidnapping for ransom to new heights this year with the abductions of dozens of foreigners, they now have more money than they may ever have dreamed of or, clearly, know what to do with: some $15 million for two dozen hostages.</p>
        <p>Cash rich, these few hundred rebels are buying sophisticated weaponry and recruiting new followers, and they have acquired a speedboat faster than anything in the Philippine navy. They are even kidnapping, and then paying ''dowry,'' for new brides. Clearly, they are more interested in their decadent new luxuries than in their fight for a separate Muslim state.</p>
        <p>And they may live to enjoy their spoils. A two-week-old military offensive against the kidnappers, who call themselves Abu Sayyaf, or Bearer of the Sword, appears to have accomplished little besides leveling several villages on the remote island of Jolo.</p>
        <p>Not a bad business proposition for local bandits in one of the poorest regions of the Philippines -- or for a growing number of hostage takers around the world. More and more these days, dollar amounts are being placed on human lives.</p>
        <p>''It's clear that this is a growing industry worldwide, though there is disagreement about how fast it is growing,'' said Paul Wilkinson, director of the Center for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. ''And it's affecting many parts of the world, like the former Soviet Union, that have been relatively free of it in the past.''</p>
        <p>Statistics are elusive in an arena marked by secrecy, corruption and sometimes the collusion of government authorities. Most often cited are the surveys of the Hiscox Group, a London-based insurer that tallied 1,789 kidnappings for ransom last year worldwide, almost all of them in 10 high-risk countries. That number shows a 6 percent rise from the previous high of 1,690 in 1998.</p>
        <p>Brian Jenkins, an expert on terrorism at the RAND Corporation, a research and policy group based in Santa Monica, Calif., said Latin America accounted for two-thirds to three-quarters of the world's ransom kidnappings, with Colombia making up about  half, followed by Mexico and Brazil. The next largest area of concentration is in Asia, he said, with the largest numbers in the coastal cities of China and in Pakistan and India. The former Soviet republics make up the next block, especially, he said, in the Caucasus. (The United States records fewer than a dozen ransom kidnappings a year.)</p>
        <p>Security firms and anti-terrorism agencies increasingly focus on kidnapping, and kidnap and ransom insurance now generate  $150 million a year in premiums worldwide, though companies that take the insurance are cautioned not to tell their employees for fear it might make them more attractive targets. Such policies provide money for ransom, and can also pay for the fees of kidnap negotiators -- which can run to $15,000 a week -- and even for psychiatric treatment for victims and their families.</p>
        <p>As foreign embassies step up their precautions, experts say, kidnappers are looking for ''softer'' targets. As more business travelers and tourists venture into out-of-the-way areas, they say, more are being seized for ransom in what one analyst called ''the dark side of globalization.''</p>
        <p>''I do think it's fair to say that with respect to terror as a whole we are going to see a major shift from government targets to the private sector -- to tourists or businessmen,'' said the analyst, Frank Cilluffo,  at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p>
        <p>Some kidnappings are intended to publicize a political view. These -- like the Iranian hostage-taking of American diplomats two decades ago -- can draw the most publicity. Other goals are to gain concessions from an enemy, to sow terror or even to dramatize a personal grievance. But in most cases, experts say, the bottom line is money, sometimes for a political cause but more often simply to enrich the kidnappers.</p>
        <p>In the southern Philippines, for example, after seizing 21 mostly foreign tourists and workers from a diving resort in April, the kidnappers at first couldn't seem to make up their minds. They demanded a separate Muslim state, a renegotiation of fishing rights, the release of imprisoned terrorists in the United States and even a local ban on Christmas celebrations. After weeks of talks they reached their bottom line. What they wanted -- and received -- was money.</p>
        <p>THE great playground of decadent guerrillas is Colombia, where Marxist rebels control huge areas of the countryside. ''They are free to do their stuff apparently untrammeled by security forces, who are not allowed to enter, and they are making vast sums of money out of the kidnapping business,'' said Mr. Wilkinson.</p>
        <p>Kidnapping techniques are changing, too, spawning a colorful new jargon among security experts. Increasingly common, particularly in Latin America and southern China, is ''express kidnapping,'' said Neil Gane, a division manager with the Hong Kong-based security firm Hill &amp; Associates. Kidnappers take victims from one automatic teller machine to another, withdrawing the maximum amount of cash each day until the accounts are empty. Then the victims are freed.</p>
        <p>In ''tiger kidnappings,'' which have grown particularly common in Britain, illegal immigrants are held -- sometimes in groups -- while ransoms are demanded from their relatives at home, Mr. Gane said. ''Bad-on-bad kidnappings'' are an emerging tactic in business disputes among rival criminal groups, particularly in Asia: just grab some of the other guy's men and hold them until he agrees to your demands.</p>
        <p>Security experts say the most difficult category is what they call ''amateur kidnappings,'' in which freelance opportunists try their hand, oblivious to unwritten rules that can help assure a safe release. ''They are more erratic, more dynamic and therefore more difficult to deal with,'' Mr. Cilluffo said. ''You don't necessarily know what's going on in their minds and they may be itchier with the trigger finger.''</p>
        <p>The Abu Sayyaf kidnappers have behaved like amateurs, but they seem to have profited from it. They changed their demands, squabbled among themselves and beheaded two hostages -- both Filipinos -- when the mood took them.</p>
        <p>But they grasped a fundamental principle of the kidnap business: hostages are not only a source of revenue but a human shield against retribution. Even as they released some hostages, and even after the military launched its attack last month, the Abu Sayyaf rebels seized more victims.</p>
