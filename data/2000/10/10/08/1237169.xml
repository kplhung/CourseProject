        <p>We once celebrated the Prague Spring; we now have the Milosevic Fall. After a little rejoicing over what seems to be the final political demise of Slobodan Milosevic, we should consider the broader meaning of his imminent departure. Does it vindicate, as some suggest, those arguing in this campaign season for peacekeeping interventionism?</p>
        <p>Up to a point. Mr. Milosevic's fall is Exhibit A for their case. Had NATO not intervened in Bosnia and Kosovo, with American leadership, Mr. Milosevic almost certainly would still hold power.</p>
        <p>Still, our debate on ''humanitarian intervention'' must continue with greater specificity on when, where and especially why such interventions should take place. Without clearly stating the purpose of each operation, we cannot define its success, and thus, we cannot know when to bring our peacekeepers home.</p>
        <p>Kosovo is a case in point. The presence of a new leader in Belgrade does not mean that we can breathe a collective sigh of relief and assume that all the Balkan pieces will fall into place. For the future of Kosovo and the mission of our peacekeepers there remain unresolved. Indeed, the Gordian knot in Kosovo may just have tightened.</p>
        <p>The Kosovars' revolt was not only against Mr. Milosevic, but part of their far older drive for national freedom. Serbia's new president, Vojislav Kostunica, may offer, as we hope, dialogue and limited compromise with the Kosovars -- perhaps even conceding them some form of real autonomy or even a loose confederation. But no Serbian leader is likely to violate his country's own sense of mystical nationalism by giving the Kosovars that independence. And if Mr. Kostunica makes what seem to be reasonable offers, it will be nearly impossible for the international community to go beyond its current position that Kosovo remains legally a part of Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>This conflict could produce a lengthy stalemate. Our peacekeepers could end up, in the eyes of the Kosovars, not as their liberators, but as an occupying force denying them their independence.</p>
        <p>The danger of this trap, which should be addressed now, is outweighed by the strategic opportunities before us. President Clinton, in early 1994, outlined his vision of a ''peaceful, undivided and democratic''' Europe. Such a Europe may be a generation or two away, but the forces of globalization, if not the policies of governments, will some day make it real. And it is deeply in our interest.</p>
        <p>Our interventions in Bosnia and Kosovo were not only humanitarian. They were essential to the pursuit of our vision of an undivided Europe. Our vision includes not only integration to the east, but also the embrace of southeastern Europe, including the Balkans. And Serbia must be included, because it is the region's geographic, economic and diplomatic heart. So long as something was rotten in Belgrade, such integration was impossible. Now, we can and need to push ahead not only on the futures of Kosovo and Montenegro, but also on a broader understanding about the future of the Balkans.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration's strategy is not simply to broaden NATO and the European Union; it has also been to support the deepening of democracy. NATO enlargement has already created more peaceful relations among the states of Central and Eastern Europe. It also has reinforced democratic structures and habits within them.</p>
        <p>In the end, it is the peoples of the region, not their governments or the international community, who will claim and preserve their freedom in a democratic Europe. The people of Serbia have demonstrated this truth, wonderfully, at their ballot boxes and in their streets. Our allies in Europe, with -- we can hope -- the Russians' assistance, now must take more of the lead and seize the opportunity that these brave Serbs have created.</p>
        <p>Some in the United States will now say we need no longer bear our part of the burden in the Balkans -- just as some have argued, despite all evidence to the contrary, that we should never have become involved. But they have neither a sense of our strategic interests nor the imagination to see a Europe that, for all the bumps in the road, is becoming whole.</p>
