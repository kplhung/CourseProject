        <p>Is Pavan Nigam ready for his next adventure with Jim Clark, the billionaire who founded Silicon Graphics, Netscape and Healtheon, now called WebMD? ''I'm going to try my best to resist any temptation for the next few months,'' Mr. Nigam, 41, a software engineering wizard who has labored to make Mr. Clark's dreams come true, said on Friday, a couple of days after resigning as  WebMD's chief technology officer. Mr. Nigam's 6-year-old daughter asked why he was home one morning during the week answering e-mail in bed. Intent on spending more time at home,  he has considered no new ventures with anyone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nigam's actions usually speak loudly enough of his allegiance to Mr. Clark. His storied projects include leading the creation at Silicon Graphics of interactive television for Time Warner, a $300 million project that was never commercialized. When he moved to Healtheon in 1996, he was a magnet who attracted a team of talented compatriots.</p>
        <p>When the company went public in February 1999, Mr. Nigam relayed the initial stock prices to a roomful of cheering colleagues. Within hours, his own stake was worth $41 million.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Clark demonstrated his loyalty to the company by offering to invest $200 million more last year, WebMD is trying to become more down-to-earth in its ambitions. It is now run by associates of its new co-chief executive, Martin J. Wygod.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nigam can get by without Mr. Wygod or Mr. Clark, as he and his family pocketed more than $7 million by selling company stock last winter at $37 to $50 a share. As of Dec. 31, they still had more than 300,000 shares, but on Friday, WebMD closed at $9.6875, this year's low.</p>
