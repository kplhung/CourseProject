        <p>FINDING good health care can be a difficult and painful process for gay people, who are often forced to explain their sexuality to doctors who may be ignorant, unsympathetic or even hostile.</p>

        <p>FINDING good health care can be a difficult and painful process for gay people, who are often forced to explain their sexuality to doctors who may be ignorant, unsympathetic or even hostile.</p>
        <p>But when Kevin Cote, a 34-year-old gay man from Hartsdale, was hospitalized for depression after his 13-year relationship ended last April, he got a surprise: the Westchester Medical Center has a special program tailored to the health needs of gay men, lesbians and the transgendered.</p>
        <p>''It was wonderful,'' Mr. Cote said of the care he got at the Gateway program, which is part of the Behavioral Health Center and has provided mental health services to about 100 gay patients from throughout the Hudson Valley since it was established 18 months ago. ''I know I wouldn't have gotten that elsewhere.''</p>
        <p>The program will be publicized at a health fair next Saturday at the Medical Center in Valhalla from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. It will feature live music, food and concessions and a series of workshops on the needs of gay men and lesbians, including sessions on financial management, domestic violence and stress management, said Donna Festa, the coordinator of the Gateway program.</p>
        <p>The program began after the Behavioral Health Center did a study in conjunction with the County Health Department and concluded that the gay and lesbian population was not being adequately served.</p>
        <p>''It was less data driven than a sense that there were services needed,'' Douglas York, the Health Center's executive director, said, adding that the proposal met no resistance.</p>
        <p>There are no official estimates on the number of gay men and lesbians in the county, but the standard assumption is 10 percent of the population, a figure determined by the sex researcher Dr. Alfred Kinsey, Ms. Festa said. That would put Westchester's gay population at about 80,000.</p>
        <p>The life of gay people in Westchester echoes the patterns of the straight community, Mr. Cote said. ''People are more likely to be coupled, and because they're living the suburban life, they're less visible.''</p>
        <p>Although the Medical Center has 500 patients enrolled in its AIDS care center, AIDS and H.I.V. are not the focus of the new program.</p>
        <p>Instead, Gateway's goal is to overcome the reluctance many gay men and lesbians feel about seeking medical care by providing comprehensive medical services with gay and gay-friendly doctors in a broad range of medical subspecialties.</p>
        <p>Although a number of medical clinics cater to homosexuals, there are no others within an advanced-care university medical center, said Dr. Randy Goldberg, an internal medicine specialist at the Medical Center who is a member of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association.</p>
        <p>Many doctors are ignorant about the health needs of gay people, and some can be hostile, Dr. Goldberg said. ''I've heard stories about female patients who were told they didn't need pap smears because they weren't having sex, or male patients being virtually brutalized by doctors during a rectal exam,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even when doctors mean well, they tend to assume their patients are heterosexual, which can create an awkward need for gay people to explain themselves. That makes them less likely to seek health care. And that reluctance contributes to some of the distinctive medical problems they face.</p>
        <p>Lesbians, for instance, have higher morbidity rates from cervical and breast cancer than heterosexual women do, in part because they are less likely to seek medical attention, Dr. Goldberg said. They may also be more likely to contract breast cancer, he said, since they are less likely to have children, which reduces the risk of contracting the disease.</p>
        <p>Depression is more common among gay people, Dr. Goldberg said, as are sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea, chlamydia and human papilloma virus, which has been associated with certain cancers.</p>
        <p>So far, Gateway is offering only mental health services through the Behavioral Health Center.</p>
        <p>The goal is to have a staff of gay primary care doctors, who will refer patients to specialists trained in sensitivity to gay concerns. That primary care center will be in space next to the Behavioral Health Center, said Dr. Stephen Peterson, chief of general medicine at the Medical Center. This strategy is particularly important for older patients, Dr. Peterson said, because they tend to need care in more than one area, and it is vital that they have doctors who understand their needs.</p>
        <p>''It's not that the doctor has to tell every other doctor that the patient is gay; they just need to tell somebody, in case there are medications that might conflict, a surgery that shouldn't take place, et cetera. These people are seeing a multitude of specialists, and one person needs to be the quarterback.''</p>
        <p>The Medical Center, which has 350 medical residents, will also take advantage of the Gateway program to train a new generation of young doctors to be sensitive to the needs of gay patients, Dr. Goldberg said.</p>
        <p>And ultimately, the program will lead to related research, he said. It will start with research into access to care -- a field that is currently drawing strong interest in the research community -- and then moving into more clinical areas.</p>
