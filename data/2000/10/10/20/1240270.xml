        <p>Gov. George W. Bush struck back hard at Democratic commercials attacking his Social Security plan, accusing Vice President Al Gore of being irresponsible and divisive on the sensitive subject.</p>
        <p>In one of his harshest broadsides so far, Mr. Bush said Mr. Gore was pitting ''grandparents against grandchildren'' for political gain instead of fixing the federal retirement system for the ''rising generation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore continued to press the attack, charging that Gov. Bush's tax cut proposal would drain Social Security, raise interest rates and undermine economic growth by giving ''too much to too few at the expense of too many.''</p>
        <p>''The economic policies my opponent has put forward in this election are not just unfair,'' Mr. Gore said. ''They're unsound, and they would hurt our economy.''</p>
