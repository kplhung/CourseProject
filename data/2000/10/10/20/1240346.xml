        <p>You know who you are. Your knowledge of baseball is so limited you think that a sacrifice bunt is a kind of religious ritual, that ''Yogi'' is a term of deference for some rubber-faced guru in New Jersey. In fact, you secretly believe that Bobby Valentine is the stage name of a lounge singer in Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>Now, more than ever, is the time to keep such secrets to yourself. A fever is spreading through the city over the World Series matchup between the two New York baseball teams, the Yankees and Mets. Its symptoms include a preference for garish clothing that bears the surnames of other people, a habit of shouting in pronounced noo-yawk accents at close quarters and a penchant for baseball trivia that elicits knowing nods from everybody but you.</p>
        <p>Excuse me, you want to say: What is a Mookie?</p>
        <p>Here now, as a public service, is a very quick Idiot's Guide to the Subway Series, offered to those who don't get it but want to.</p>
        <p>First, understand this. Baseball is the greatest game ever created, a game of thoughtful pace and sudden excitement, a game in which certain individuals and brief moments freeze in memory and loom in context. For Yankee fans, Mickey Mantle was not just a hard-drinking Oklahoman with a gift for hitting a baseball; he was a god, the personification of a certain Eisenhower-era innocence. For Mets fans, the 1969 Mets were not just talented ballplayers who won the World Series; they were gods, the triumphant underdogs for a war-weary country looking for miracles.</p>
        <p>Also remember: in New York baseball, the past is the present, the present the past. The Mets of today are the karmic heirs of the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers, teams that bristled in the shadows of the dominant Yankees before skulking off to California after the 1957 season. If you encounter an older fan who talks wistfully about Oisk and Pee Wee and the Say Hey Kid, do not bring up Spanky, Alfalfa and the rest of the Little Rascals. Just nod and say it must have been wonderful.</p>
        <p>Now we may begin.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are at home in Yankee Stadium, a majestic structure in the Bronx where people get misty-eyed remembering Joe DiMaggio's graceful tending of center field. The Mets are at home in Shea Stadium, an afterthought of cement in Queens where people get misty-eyed trying to digest a Shea hot dog.</p>
        <p>The mascot for the Mets wears a Mets uniform and has an oversized head; his name is Mister Met. The mascot for the Yankees wears a Yankees warm-up jacket and has a somewhat smaller head; his name is Mister Giuliani.</p>
        <p>There is a tendency to portray the Yankees as a collection of high-priced athletic mercenaries, assembled by a multimillionaire called, without affection, The Boss, who goes into an apoplectic rage when his team loses a squeaker in Kansas City in June. This is true.</p>
        <p>There is a tendency to portray the Mets as a ragtag bunch of underpaid overachievers who have reached the World Series on sheer, All-American gumption. This is false. At $81.8 million, the Mets' annual team salary is at the upper end of the major-league scale (although somewhat less than the $112 million team salary for the Yankees). And the team's management somehow managed to scratch up a $91 million contract for its star player, Mike Piazza.</p>
        <p>Piazza, by the way, is the Horatio Alger of baseball. The elders of baseball once thought so little of his talents that 1,389 other young players were selected before him in the 1988 amateur draft. Now he hits rocket home runs, dates the Playboy Playmate of the Millennium -- not the year, but the millennium -- and has enough money to finance his own Senate campaign in New Jersey. Every so often he changes his hair color; no one says anything.</p>
        <p>Piazza also figures in one of the more emotional World Series subplots. During a Mets-Yankees game in July, he stepped up to the plate against Roger Clemens, a star pitcher for the Yankees who apparently practices scowling in his free time. A Clemens fastball struck Piazza in the helmet, giving him a concussion and prompting speculation that it was in retaliation for his considerable talent at hitting previous pitches thrown by Clemens.</p>
        <p>When asked about this theory, Clemens scowled.</p>
        <p>If you decide to root for the Mets, agree with others that Clemens should have been suspended for ''ringing Piazza's bell''; this will suggest a fluency in baseball lexicon. If you decide to root for the Yankees, shrug your shoulders and say, ''That's baseball''; this will suggest a certain toughness, as well as a personal decision never to play baseball yourself.</p>
        <p>Piazza and Clemens are but two of the protagonists you will come to know in the days ahead.</p>
        <p>The Yankees manager is Joe Torre, a former major-league player who hails from Brooklyn. Always at his side is Don Zimmer, whose bell was rung so loudly during his playing years that his head bears two indentations from the holes drilled by doctors to relieve swelling. Legend has it that he has a metal plate in his skull; you can show off by telling people this is not so.</p>
        <p>The Mets manager is Bobby Valentine, a former major-leaguer from Stamford, Conn. He is the flibbertigibbet to Torre's Zen. When he is thrown out of games for flibbertigibbet behavior, he has been known to sneak back into the dugout wearing a mustache-and-glasses disguise. One of his coaches is Mookie Wilson, who hit a routine ground ball in the 1986 World Series that rolled through the legs of a Boston Red Sox first baseman poised like a miniature-golf obstacle, sparking the Mets to a World Series triumph, their last.</p>
        <p>Then, of course, there are the players.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have right fielder Paul O'Neill, who tends to get into fistfights with water coolers when he is not happy, which is often; center fielder Bernie Williams, a soulful guitar player who also uses his dexterity to count the $87.5 million the team pays him. And shortstop Derek Jeter, a brilliant young ballplayer who is broadening his off-the-field education by dating Miss Universe.</p>
        <p>The Yankees pitchers include Andy Pettitte, a mild-mannered young man who is getting some tips on menacing from Clemens, he of the scowl. There is also Orlando Hernandez, better known as El Duque, whose personal history is as tricky as his slider. If you believe the version he has peddled to Hollywood, he defected from Cuba in 1997 on a raft that survived storms and sharks; if you believe his fellow stowaways, he left Cuba on a 20-foot wooden boat with a six-cylinder engine. Even his age is uncertain.</p>
        <p>Now a matter of certain delicacy: Chuck Knoblauch. For several years he was among the better second basemen in baseball. But this season he could not throw the ball to first base with precision, to the chagrin of his teammates and spectators along the first-base line. He is expected to play his position during the Series, so if you find yourself at a ballgame, try to resist the urge to shout out the diagnosis: ''Hey Knobby! It's in your head!''</p>
        <p>The Mets, meanwhile, have their own collection of seed-spitting, crotch-tugging, heartwarming personalities.</p>
        <p>Todd Zeile, at first base, is a direct descendant of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams; he is considered the best hitter of the three. Benny Agbayani, in the outfield, hit a game-ending, extra-inning home run against the San Francisco Giants two weeks ago, easing whatever pain lingered from being called only the 36th-best athlete of the century from Hawaii in a Sports Illustrated list.</p>
        <p>Among the Mets pitchers, perhaps the most intriguing are found in the bullpen. There is Turk Wendell, who wears an animal-claw necklace, likes to become one with the resin bag before pitching, and relaxes by writing poetry in his free time -- including that study of simile, ''Life Is Like a Baseball.''</p>
        <p>There is also John Franco, who at 40 is the oldest Met. He has earned millions of dollars playing baseball, but still followed the modest dreams of so many of his fellow Brooklyn natives; he moved to Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Finally, you must know that lifetime allegiance to a specific team is a thing of the past among ballplayers. The Mets fans who once hooted Al Leiter when he pitched for the Yankees now worship him as a Met. The Yankee fans who now freely call David Cone ''Coney'' and Dwight Gooden ''Doc'' called the pitchers much worse when they played for the Mets.</p>
        <p>And you know who you are.</p>
