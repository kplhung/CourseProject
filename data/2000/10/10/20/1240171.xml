        <p>OFF KECK ROAD  By Mona Simpson  167 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $19.</p>
        <p>In ''Anywhere but Here'' (1986), the dazzling first novel that made her name, Mona Simpson created an indelible portrait of a mother and daughter who leave their small-town home in Wisconsin and head out to California to start a new life, tabula rasa.</p>
        <p>In her latest book, a far more modest production, Ms. Simpson explores the flip side of that American dream: she looks at the lives of two women who stay in the small Wisconsin town where they were born and forgo the temptations and risks of the wider world. The narrative strategy employed in ''Off Keck Road'' not only echoes the circumscribed lives of its heroines, but it also stands as a mirror image of the approach used in ''Anywhere but Here'': the new novella is slender and laconic where that earlier novel was expansive and prolix, quietly self-contained where the former was sprawling and allusive.</p>
        <p>After the disappointment of the author's last book -- an oddly detached and stilted novel called ''A Regular Guy'' (1996), about a Steve Jobs-like entrepreneur -- ''Off Keck Road'' showcases the gifts of emotional sympathy and psychological observation that Ms. Simpson used to such enormous effect in ''Anywhere but Here'' and ''The Lost Father'' (1992). In fewer than 200 pages it gives us the shape and texture of two entire lives as well as a dozen cameo portraits of the friends and relatives and acquaintances who make up these two women's intersecting worlds.</p>
        <p>Ms. Simpson's heroines, Bea and Shelley, come from opposite sides of the tracks in Green Bay and get to know each other only through their mutual involvement with a wealthy businessman named Bill.</p>
        <p>Bea is a career woman who left behind a job at a Chicago advertising agency to return home to take care of her ailing mother; the daughter of a prominent doctor, she grew up in a grand old house in one of the town's tonier neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Shelley, one of five children from the hardscrabble neighborhood of Keck Road, came down with polio when she was 5; she has spent much of her life since caring for her grandmother and doing odd jobs for friends.</p>
        <p>For all their apparent differences, both Bea and Shelley are outsiders who have had difficulty connecting to other people and difficulty in throwing off family tethers to pursue dreams of their own. The plain-faced Bea has had a series of disappointing crushes on men, who invariably move on from her to someone younger or prettier or more forward. She once dreamed of making a new, exciting life for herself in the big city, but now settles for a subscription to New York magazine.</p>
        <p>The thing she had most wanted in life, she thinks, was love of ''the married-and-living-together-in-a-house-in-Green-Bay variety,'' but she has long since settled into the staid routines of a spinster. She works part time selling real estate, serves on the board of the historical society, knits shawls and sweaters for clients and writes letters, ''generally of the unanswered kind,'' to local newspapers. The high points of her week are the occasional meals she shares with her boss, Bill, a man with whom she has carried on a nervous -- and unconsummated -- flirtation for years.</p>
        <p>Shelley, on her part, has been at loose ends since her beloved grandmother died. She settles into a desultory 13-year affair with a married man named George, who lives across the street, until one day he and his wife pick up and move to Florida. She eventually gets a job as a live-in nurse for a wealthy real-estate tycoon named Bill, who is soon giving her expensive gifts.</p>
        <p>As things go in such small-town novels, this Bill turns out to be the same Bill that Bea secretly pines for. Yet if the plot of ''Keck Road'' verges on the predictable, Ms. Simpson nonetheless manages to invest it with an unusual measure of felt emotion, delineating the myriad small choices, random events and missed opportunities that can determine the contours of a life.</p>
        <p>At the same time she anchors the lives of Shelley and Bea in the rituals and routines of Green Bay, a town where everyone seems to know everyone else, from their reputation in high school to their current social standing, from their marital woes to the difficulties of their children. She shows us how neighborhoods have aged or been renewed, how subdivisions and strip malls have encroached upon the town, how fast-food joints (Arby's and Taco Bells, Big Boys and I-Hops) have replaced the charming little restaurants ''you could duck into for a treat.''</p>
        <p>In looking at how this world has shaped two women's lives, ''Off Keck Road'' re-examines the dichotomy that has animated Ms. Simpson's work to date, namely the pull between rootlessness and freedom, domesticity and independence. The novella isn't nearly as ambitious or compelling as ''Anywhere but Here,'' but in laying out a five-decade-long portrait of a small town and its residents, ''Keck Road'' leaves us with a melancholy sense of time and flux and loss.</p>
