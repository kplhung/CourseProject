        <p>He has fought the good fight, surviving nasty party factionalism to get his name onto the ballot in almost every state and obtain $12.6 million in federal campaign money. He has even ridden out three recent hospital visits for gallstone problems.</p>
        <p>But as he carries the Reform Party banner into the November elections at the age of 61, Patrick J. Buchanan is waging what he concedes could be his last battle as a political candidate. Facing a steady stream of polls that show his conservative message resonating with barely 1 percent of the voters, he all but acknowledged today that he was ready to bow out after the elections in favor of new leadership for an organization he has single-handedly overhauled since bolting the Republican Party last year.</p>
        <p>''I'll have to sit down and take a look at where we are,'' he said over breakfast, sounding not so much saddened by the year's fortunes as proud of his accomplishments. ''I am a romantic. I like to roll the dice and take a chance. But I am also very much a realist. Buchananism may prevail even if Buchanan does not.''</p>
        <p>He is not going out just yet, mind you. Since the third of his recent medical procedures, he has been on the road almost constantly, visiting 22 states and planning stops in 10 more or so before Election Day.</p>
        <p>Fortified by new radio and television commercials that trumpet his ''America first'' themes, he is concentrating on states where he sees weakness or at least vulnerability in the Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Among them are New York and California, and also Minnesota, where Mr. Buchanan spoke to an audience of several hundred today at the University of Minnesota Law School.</p>
        <p>(That audience did not include the Reform Party's greatest star of recent years, Gov. Jesse Ventura, who, describing the party as ''hopelessly dysfunctional,'' abandoned it eight months ago, in part over Mr. Buchanan's entry. A spokeswoman for the governor, now an independent, said he was scheduled to have lunch at the time Mr. Buchanan was speaking.)</p>
        <p>It is in states that Mr. Bush is not likely to win, Mr. Buchanan said, that he has a better chance to convince voters sympathetic to his views that their support would not be wasted on a third-party candidate.</p>
        <p>''George Bush has written off New York State,'' Mr. Buchanan said. ''So a vote for Bush there is a wasted vote. But a vote for Pat Buchanan can help accomplish something:  fighting for a third party, building a new party that doesn't poach or thieve but offers the American people something new.''</p>
        <p>His concern, of course, which he readily acknowledged, is that for now the country appears unready to embrace a third party, either his on the right or Ralph Nader's Green Party on the left. Mr. Nader has polled somewhat better than Mr. Buchanan in most national surveys, reaching as high as 4 percent in some, causing more concern for Vice President Al Gore than Mr. Buchanan has caused for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Unlike 1992, when the Reform founder, Ross Perot, tapped into a widespread discontent with government and won 19 percent of the presidential vote, or 1994, when Republicans captured both houses of Congress for the first time in four decades, this year finds a prosperous nation relatively content.</p>
        <p>That, Mr. Buchanan said, does not necessarily bode well for a third-party campaign now, especially one like his, which promotes many more issues than Mr. Perot championed in his two runs for the White House. Mr. Perot focused largely on budget, trade and government reform; Mr. Buchanan has restyled the party to include stands against abortion rights, moral decline, liberal immigration policies and foreign military intervention.</p>
        <p>''Look,'' he said, unflaggingly animated in an hourlong interview, ''as long as we're fighting wars from 15,000 feet and not losing a soldier, when the unemployment rate is 3.9 percent, the Dow is at 11,500 and the Nasdaq is at 5,000, it's not going to be easy for us.</p>
        <p>''But when the chickens come home to roost, this whole coalition will be there for somebody, and then they're going to think, 'What ever happened to that guy back in 2000?' There's no doubt these issues can win. But 2000 might not be the year for them.''</p>
        <p>For all his triumphs in the Reform Party, one failure still rankles: the inability to convince the Commission on Presidential Debates that he and Mr. Nader deserved a place on the stage with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore these last two weeks. Had he managed to prevail, Mr. Buchanan said, polls would have shown him ''in the teens right now, the upper teens.''</p>
        <p>''But the perception is now that it's a very, very close race,'' he said, ''and people want to bet on it like the Super Bowl because there are only two people in it.'' He laughed. ''We're in the Fiesta Bowl with Nader.''</p>
        <p>Even Perot-like support would not do the party much good for now, other than to qualify it for federal campaign funds for 2004 by surpassing the minimum requirement of 5 percent of the popular vote. Nor did Mr. Buchanan make it sound as if jumping even that modest hurdle would have a huge bearing on his own future. After the election, he said, he will assess the results, then meet with party leaders to measure their appetite for party building and his role in it, as a candidate or, more likely, an elder statesman of sorts.</p>
        <p>Steven J. Rosenstone, dean of the college of liberal arts at the University of Minnesota and author of a 1996 book, ''Third Parties in America,'' said that with or without Mr. Buchanan, the Reform Party might undergo yet another metamorphosis over the next four years in an effort to gain ground.</p>
        <p>''This is not unlike the pattern that has befallen other third parties,'' Mr. Rosenstone said. ''They start with a bang, some with a flamboyant candidate, then factions emerge, issues are co-opted by the mainstream parties, and the novelty wears off.''</p>
        <p>All of that remains to be seen, Mr. Buchanan said.</p>
        <p>''We're going to go all out for the next three weeks,'' he said enthusiastically, and ''then I don't know what I am going to do after that. A lot depends on how well the Reform Party does. But I know one thing: I'm not going back to the Republican Party. The further away from it I get, the better I feel.''</p>
