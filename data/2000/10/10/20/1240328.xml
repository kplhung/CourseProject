        <p>Shares of Parthus Technologies increased $3.88, or 9 percent, to $47, a day after the company, an Irish maker of processors for wireless Internet devices, reported a 204 percent increase in third-quarter license revenue and introduced its latest product for mobile computing. For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Parthus had a net loss of $2.3 million on sales of $8.6 million, up 76 percent from a year earlier. Licensing and royalty revenue rose to $4.5 million from $1.5 million in the prior year. The Parthus Info-Stream chip, designed in collaboration with the British mobile device maker Psion, uses Psion's Symbian operating system, but also runs the Linux, Palm OS and Microsoft Pocket PC operating systems. Psion and Motorola have signed licensing agreements to use the chip in future releases of personal digital assistants and cell phones. Previous Parthus chips incorporate global positioning technology into car navigation systems, and wireless audio streaming into MP3 players.</p>
