        <p>Struggling to retain employees after a turbulent year, the Coca-Cola Company has instituted sweeping salary increases for the first time in at least two decades, according to company officials.</p>
        <p>The raises, ranging from less than $1,000 to as much as $15,000, came after the company determined that many of its workers were paid less than their counterparts at other large companies, a criticism Coke employees have leveled for years.</p>
        <p>Company officials did not disclose how many workers were affected, but characterized the number of increases as ''significant,'' involving United States employees at every level of the company, from entry-level assistants to corporate managers. Though longtime company officials could not remember a precedent for such widespread raises, they described the move as necessary in light of a turnover rate that has been increasing all year. Now at 12 percent, it is sharply higher than any other year since 1996, even with the elimination of 5,200 positions this year.</p>
        <p>The raises are the latest in a series of steps taken by Douglas N. Daft, chairman and chief executive, to repair sagging confidence in a company once known for its employee loyalty. Dispirited by the layoffs, a stock price that has fallen by roughly a third in the last two years and the taint of a racial discrimination lawsuit, roughly 1,000 of 8,600 Coke employees in the United States are expected to leave this year. Among those who remain, many describe a corporate atmosphere riddled with apprehension and distrust.</p>
        <p>Shares of Coca-Cola fell $1, to $57.19 yesterday.</p>
        <p>To bolster morale, Mr. Daft has initiated a permanent casual dress code, institutionalized half-days on Fridays in the summer and issued early bonuses in August. And despite a slowdown in the domestic soft- drink market, Coca-Cola stock has rebounded somewhat in the last month, a boost for the many employees with stock options. But the pay raises have been viewed with suspicion by many current and former employees, as well as some of their lawyers.</p>
        <p>Under court orders, Coke has not yet disclosed the terms of a settlement of a major racial discrimination suit. And many black employees, fearful that Coke is trying to avoid the stigma of a large cash payment and any guilt that might imply, are accusing Coke of trying to appease disgruntled workers so that a small settlement will seem more palatable when the terms are announced next month.</p>
        <p>''They think it's clearly a tactic to lure people into accepting a bad deal,'' said Willie E. Gary, who filed a separate $1.5 billion lawsuit in June on behalf of four black employees accusing the company of racial harassment and discrimination. Since the pay raises took effect two weeks ago, Mr. Gary said he had received letters and phone calls from numerous Coke employees who had interpreted the raises to mean that the settlement would not meet their expectations. ''They think it's a total slap in the face to people who deserve more.''</p>
        <p>Coke officials vehemently denied the accusations, noting that Mr. Daft personally promised all employees that the company would review its compensation policy in May, one month before a settlement was reached. Since that time, the company said, it has undertaken an extensive review of 500 other companies in a variety of industries, including direct competitors like Pepsico, consumer product giants like Procter &amp; Gamble and even Internet companies like Yahoo. Coke also examined what its employees were paid case  by case. So while the raises did occur within weeks of the final settlement, there was no connection between the two, the company said.</p>
        <p>''What we have learned throughout this process is that -- despite our best efforts -- there are some individuals that we will never win over,'' said Ben Deutsch, a Coke spokesman.</p>
        <p>The company said it expected much of the heightened tension to dissipate in the coming weeks, when as many as 2,000 current and former black employees find out how much money they are entitled to receive for a 1999 lawsuit contending that Coke denied promotions and raises on the basis of race. But many employees have indicated that, barring a surprisingly large payment, they plan to opt out of the settlement and pursue litigation independently, potentially prolonging an issue that the company is anxious to put to rest.</p>
