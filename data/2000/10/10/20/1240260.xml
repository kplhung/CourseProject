        <p>Minutes before the House was to vote on a measure condemning the mass killings of Armenians in Turkey 85 years ago as genocide, J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker, withdrew the resolution tonight, citing President Clinton's warnings that a vote could harm national security and hurt relations with Turkey, a NATO ally.</p>
        <p>In a telephone call late Wednesday and in a letter today, Mr. Clinton urged Mr. Hastert to withdraw the measure, saying it could inflame tensions in the Middle East, embolden President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and interfere with American efforts to stabilize the Balkans.</p>
        <p>In addition, Turkey had threatened to ground American warplanes that fly out of Turkish air bases to patrol northern Iraq, and cancel a $4.5 billion deal to buy 145 attack helicopters made in Texas. Angry crowds have protested outside the United States Embassy in Ankara.</p>
        <p>''The president believes that passage of this resolution may adversely impact the situation in the Middle East and risk the lives of Americans,'' Mr. Hastert said. ''This is not an idle request,'' Mr. Hastert continued. ''We all know that the situation in the Middle East is unusually tense.  The cease-fire now in place between Israel and the Palestinians is fragile.  The Congress, while it has a right to express its opinions on critical issues of the day, also must be cognizant of the consequences of the expressions of those opinions.''</p>
        <p>The contentious resolution had languished in Congress for a decade.  But this year, Mr. Hastert promised Representative James E. Rogan of California, a House impeachment manager and his party's most vulnerable incumbent in the House, that he would bring it to a floor vote.</p>
        <p>Even though the measure is non-binding and does not go to the Senate or to President Clinton for approval, it is a top priority in Mr. Rogan's Southern California district, which has the largest Armenian-American constituency in the country.</p>
        <p>Armenians have maintained that as many as 1.5 million of their people were killed from 1915 to 1923 as part of a campaign by the Ottoman Empire to force Armenians out of eastern Turkey. The Turks have acknowledged that some 300,000 people were killed, but have said that the deaths occurred when the Ottomans tried to quell civil unrest. The Ottoman Empire became Turkey in 1923.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Turkish Embassy, Namik Tan, praised Mr. Hastert's decision, saying, ''This is what should have happened.''</p>
        <p>So did the White House, which marshaled an all-out campaign to kill the measure, enlisting the president's top foreign and military advisers, the joint chiefs of staff and various national security experts.</p>
        <p>''We applaud the speaker's decision,'' said P. J. Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security Council. ''It was the right thing to do for America's national interests, the right thing to do for stability in a volatile region, and the right thing to do for both Turkey and Armenia.''</p>
        <p>Supporters of the measure, who said they had the votes to pass it, expressed disappointment. ''While I am personally saddened by this change, I remain pleased with our historic success to enact this resolution,'' Mr. Rogan said in a statement.  ''Never before has this legislation earned even a hearing.''</p>
        <p>Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking House Democrat and sponsor of the resolution, said in an interview: ''It will never be the right time to do this for those who disagree with us. Countries need to own up for their own inadequacies.''</p>
