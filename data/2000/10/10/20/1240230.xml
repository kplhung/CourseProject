      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The winding road from the capital ends here, for anyone who would not like to risk becoming the hostage of a warlord named Umar.</p>
        <p>Barely 20 miles from Dushanbe, the capital, four young mujahedeen fighters brandish Kalashnikov rifles at a checkpoint a quarter-mile from Mr. Umar's base, in a former auto-repair factory surrounded by cotton fields and persimmon orchards.</p>
        <p>Umar, they say, is not receiving guests today. Besides, one advised, he is an unpredictable man and it is ''not recommended'' that visitors call on him lest he decide to rob them, or shoot them, as one warlord is suspected of doing to four United Nations workers killed on this road two years ago.</p>
        <p>Umar's deployment of Islamic fighters on the only route out of Dushanbe to the rebellious Karategin Valley underscores the lawlessness in Tajikistan. Two years after a national reconciliation that followed a devastating civil war, Tajikistan is still a land of clan-based paramilitary forces, Islamic revivalism and regional enmities.</p>
        <p>The man standing astride the divided politics of the country is President Emomali Rahmonov, a former collective-farm manager and Communist Party apparatchik who rules with enduring support from Russia and by sharing power and money with the enemies his army could not defeat on the battlefield.</p>
        <p>Through financial inducements, and sometimes just brute force, Mr. Rahmonov is reconstructing central authority in Tajikistan by deepening relations with Russia and the West, who have pursued the closer ties with their own interests in mind.</p>
        <p>Fighting Islamic extremism and drug trafficking has become the highest priority for both Central Asian and Western governments. In addition to asserting his authority against former enemies at home, Mr. Rahmonov has tried to prevent Islamic militants based in Afghanistan from expanding their guerrilla warfare and terrorism across Tajikistan's frontiers to Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
        <p>''Tajikistan is a key state,'' said Robert P. Finn, the United States ambassador in Dushanbe. With Afghanistan to the south and all of Central Asia to the north, a destabilized Tajikistan ''is a danger for all of its neighbors.''</p>
        <p>Such concern is well founded. The long and violent civil war after the breakup of the Soviet Union has made Tajikistan unique among Central Asian states.</p>
        <p>''It was like a revolution in our country,'' said Hizomov Mirzokhuzha, a deputy commander of Tajikistan's police force in Soviet times. He took up arms against Mr. Rahmonov in 1992 as a top military commander of the United Tajik Opposition, a loose coalition of Islamic forces, democratic movements and regional bosses long excluded from power who were seeking to overthrow the post-Soviet hangers-on and the regional clans they served.</p>
        <p>''During the time of the Soviet Union, I could never have imagined that I would become a rebel,'' Mr. Mirzokhuzha said in an interview at his home in Dushanbe. ''No one wants to end up fighting, but the life of a person is written -- and sometimes, if you don't fight, you are going to be killed.''</p>
        <p>And there was plenty of killing, with estimates of 30,000 to 50,000 dead and up to one million refugees.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Mirzokhuzha is minister for customs taxation in Mr. Rahmonov's cabinet, a post that belies his real power as he helps the government enforce the peace by advising how to integrate rebellious warlords once under his command into the armed forces, where the reward for peace is a paycheck.</p>
        <p>''The republic is now democratic,  and it is on that foundation that we are working,'' Mr. Mirzokhuzha said.</p>
        <p>But the process is anything but smooth, as Umar's roadblock demonstrated. While the handful of mujahedeen controlled the road here, Tajikistan's armed forces rumbled into the Karategin Valley to suppress and disarm the last of the rebellious warlords there, Mullo Abdullo, who fought as a field commander with the opposition during the war. On Sept. 11, about 40 of his estimated 100 Islamic fighters surrendered; others melted into the mountains.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abdullo's grievance was simple: He was not happy that his forces were not offered jobs in Tajikstan's army, as required by the peace protocols. Government officials were loath to offer him and his men positions because they are suspected of the execution-style killing of the United Nations workers in 1998.</p>
        <p>But some compromise was reached in September. After Mr. Abdullo's surrender, Mr. Rahmonov surprised many by touring major cities in Karategin Valley, pressing the flesh in town-hall-style meetings that received extensive television coverage. The visit was his first to the heartland of Tajikistan's Islamic revolt.</p>
        <p>''The president's trip to the northeast shows that the situation in the area is stable,'' said Amirkul H. Azimov, secretary of Tajikistan's national security council, though he conceded that ''some people were very nervous'' that an attempt would be made on Mr. Rahmonov's life.</p>
        <p>While Tajikistan may be more stable than ever before, the threat from Islamic extremists seems to be increasing. For that reason, some Western governments seem content to overlook Tajikistan's dismal human rights record. Freedom of the press has ceased to exist, with more than 30 journalists killed since 1992 and 150 or more forced into exile.</p>
        <p>In September, Russian military officials who command 25,000 troops along the Tajik-Afghan border reinforced their positions after fighters for the Taliban, the fundamentalist movement that rules most of Afghanistan, scored fresh victories against the ''northern alliance'' of Ahmed Shah Masoud. Russia and Tajikistan provide rear-area support to Mr. Masoud's forces.</p>
        <p>Neighboring Uzbekistan has also been a concern. The State Department placed the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan on the list of terrorist organizations in September, asserting that its leader, Juma Namangani, was receiving support from Osama bin Laden, whose Afghanistan-based group is suspected in the bombings of two American embassies in Africa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Namangani fought alongside Tajikistan's Islamic rebels during the civil war and has conducted guerrilla-style campaigns against Kyrgyz and Uzbek Army forces for the past two summers. Former colleagues here say Mr. Namangani has taken up arms in response to the repressive, antireligious policies of the Uzbek president, Islom Karimov.</p>
        <p>''I know Juma Namangani very well,'' said Mr. Mirzokhuzha, the former opposition leader. ''The people where he is from complained that the government came to their village and started arresting those who were going to the mosque and praying. They arrested his relatives, too, and that is why he founded this group -- to liberate them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Namangani's support from Mr. bin Laden may include helicopters that now transport Mr. Namangani's rebels across Tajik territory, Western officials say, as well as financial aid that has allowed Mr. Namagani to buy food from villagers when his troops are in the field, a tactic that has improved his support.</p>
        <p>Tajikistan's neighbors have charged that President Rahmonov or members of the Islamic opposition who now sit in his cabinet provide bases for Islamic fighters attacking Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, but Mr. Rahmonov says his security forces have worked to block attacks from Tajik territory.</p>
        <p>''There were never such bases in Tajikistan and there are not now,'' said Mr. Azimov, the security council adviser.</p>
        <p>As other Central Asian leaders have formed security arrangements, Mr. Rahmonov has tied his country's economic and security interests most prominently to Russia's. When the leaders of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan canceled their trips to Yalta in August for a summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Rahmonov dutifully showed up to discuss plans to establish a permanent Russian military base in Tajikistan.</p>
        <p>''Russia was, is and will be our main partner for the future,'' Mr. Azimov said.</p>
