        <p>As their foreign ministers gathered here today in advance of a weekend summit meeting, Arab leaders sought to formulate a unified position that could appease popular demands to punish Israel but also keep the door open to future Arab-Israeli peacemaking.</p>
        <p>The Arab League meeting, which opens on Saturday, is expected to affirm Arab support for the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, with the richer oil-producing nations putting aside their active distaste for Mr. Arafat and pledging an infusion of money for his administration.</p>
        <p>But the presidents, princes and kings who lead the 22 member nations of the Arab League are also under exceptional public pressure to produce more at their meeting than their customary words of support for Palestinian self-determination and statehood.</p>
        <p>Heavy Palestinian casualties during clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip this month have inflamed public passions against both Israel and the United States, which is accused of abandoning all pretense of even-handedness in the now-paralyzed peace effort.</p>
        <p>The tide of anger -- more open and more defiant than any display of grass-roots political activity in at least a decade -- has left many of the Arab leaders in a state of near panic that the demonstrations could turn into more generalized protest against their own governments.</p>
        <p>One clear outcome of the summit meeting will be an embracing of Mr. Arafat, who could direct the outcome through the demands he makes of his fellow Arab leaders on behalf of Palestinians. Faced with his own widespread public impatience with seven years of peace talks, which have produced paltry results in the view of many Palestinians, he will be looking for regional backing for his next moves.</p>
        <p>''Arafat going to the summit is like Barak going to Clinton,'' said Tahseen Bashir, a former Egyptian diplomat and aide to Anwar el-Sadat, the assassinated president. ''When they are cornered, they go to a bigger authority, either to redistribute blame for a failure or to get support and extra money. It means the problem is bigger than they are.''</p>
        <p>More extreme elements in the Arab world have already issued calls for a reactivation of an Arab boycott, a freeze on the already sparse Arab diplomatic and economic exchanges with Israel, the use of oil and oil-related contracts as a weapon against Israel's Western allies, and the wholesale transfer of arms to Palestinians to attack Israelis.</p>
        <p>Yet there are also signs of deep ambivalence toward steps that would erase the tenuous Arab-Israeli thaw of the last decade and push relations back to the days of total nonrecognition.</p>
        <p>In a television interview on Wednesday, Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, urged that nations surrounding Israel open their borders to the flow of weapons and Arab fighters to join in a Palestinian uprising.</p>
        <p>But when pressed on details, Mr. Saleh toned down his demand. ''Yemen wants to help Palestinians defend themselves, not to start a war,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Syria's foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, was quoted by Syrian state radio today as calling for an end to all forms of Arab normalization with Israel. Syria, however, has already declared peace, on its own terms, as its national goal.</p>
        <p>In the ministers' meeting here, Mr. Shara softened the impact of his words, which would in any case affect only a few Arab nations. ''It is natural, that here we are to speak about peace and not about something else,'' he said.</p>
        <p>President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt also said the summit meeting was not intended to give up on negotiating a final peace between Arab nations and Israel. In an interview on state television, he responded forcefully when asked if the Arab League would carry out harsh measures against Israel.</p>
        <p>''What hard measures?'' he said. ''The logic of war is outdated. Matters can only be solved by negotiation and international pressure.''</p>
        <p>But less moderate leaders could still push the summit meeting to a more extreme response, especially if the situation in the Palestinian territories deteriorates in the days leading up to the meeting.</p>
        <p>One unpredictable factor will be Iraq, which will be represented at a meeting of Arab leaders for the first time in 10 years. Since its invasion of fellow Arab League member Kuwait in 1990, Iraq has not been invited to the group's top-level meetings. It officially condemned Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, and has urged Arab nations to back a full-scale Palestinian war against Israel.</p>
        <p>But another maverick state, Libya, may not show up at all. The Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, has already called a draft statement presented to Arab League members to be so feeble that he may not bother to come to Cairo.</p>
        <p>''They will make fools of themselves in front of the people because they are so weak,'' he said of his fellow Arab leaders. ''It's as if they are standing naked without a fig leaf. We declare. We condemn. We call for. It's the same old communique.''</p>
        <p>If the other Arab leaders on their way to Cairo now find themselves caught in a political vise between public anger and temperate diplomacy, it is partly one of their own making.</p>
        <p>Many governments have been playing with fire lately, stoking popular rage against Israel by constantly broadcasting scenes of past Arab-Israeli wars and war songs. State-owned newspapers have excoriated Jews and Judaism, as well as the United States.</p>
        <p>Anti-American and anti-Israeli protests throughout the region have recently been reinforced by open calls for boycotts of American products and denunciation of European and American companies as Israeli fronts.</p>
        <p>The drumbeat of hatred and suspicion has gotten so loud in Egypt that the British grocery chain Sainsbury's has posted signs in its windows proclaiming that it will do nothing to help Israel ''financially or politically.''</p>
        <p>Arab leaders, without exception, also lionized the Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon, lauding them as a liberation movement that, through force of arms, drove Israel to abandon its occupation of southern Lebanon in May.</p>
        <p>Turning off public anger toward Israel, and calling for negotiations over war, may now prove difficult for moderate Arab leaders.</p>
        <p>''Nobody will have the courage to stand against the lowest common denominator of public opinion,'' said a former American diplomat to the Middle East. The summit meeting, he added, will provide a road map to future relations between the Arab nations and the United States.</p>
        <p>''It will reveal if Arab states like Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia can be a moderating force,'' he said. ''In the past they were willing to take the risk of protecting the United States from the more obnoxious elements in Arab politics and to be associated with the United States.''</p>
