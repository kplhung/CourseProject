        <p>My daughter could write a book about what it's like to have a pesky little brother. Of course, it would have some stiff competition: Judy Blume's classic ''Superfudge,'' which has been adapted into an hourlong musical by Theaterworks/USA.</p>
        <p>Directed by Janet Bogardus, ''Superfudge'' is more like a sitcom than a tale with a central plot line. (Imagine ''Malcolm in the Middle'' turned into ''Peter on Top.'') Nevertheless, it is highly entertaining, with Colin Hanlon playing Peter Hatcher, the 11-year-old narrator, and Matthew Wilson as his precocious 4-year-old brother, Farley, nicknamed Fudge.</p>

        <p>My daughter could write a book about what it's like to have a pesky little brother. Of course, it would have some stiff competition: Judy Blume's classic ''Superfudge,'' which has been adapted into an hourlong musical by Theaterworks/USA.</p>
        <p>Directed by Janet Bogardus, ''Superfudge'' is more like a sitcom than a tale with a central plot line. (Imagine ''Malcolm in the Middle'' turned into ''Peter on Top.'') Nevertheless, it is highly entertaining, with Colin Hanlon playing Peter Hatcher, the 11-year-old narrator, and Matthew Wilson as his precocious 4-year-old brother, Farley, nicknamed Fudge.</p>
        <p>Like many preadolescents, Peter finds that growing up can be full of unpleasant surprises. His mother (Angela Parks) is pregnant, and his father (Matt Boethin) announces that the family will move from Manhattan to Princeton, N.J., for a year.</p>
        <p>Peter has the usual fears about being the new boy, but the real problem is Fudge. He whines, wants to tag along everywhere and plays practical jokes. Peter must escort him on his first day at kindergarten, which turns into a crisis. Before Fudge is sent to another class, he bids his unsympathetic teacher a fond adieu: ''Goodbye, Ratface!'' I was alarmed at how amused my son, Matthew, was; he just started kindergarten.</p>
        <p>Michael Slade's book humorously captures the typical interactions of siblings far apart in age. And David Evans's music and Faye Greenberg's lyrics strike just the right tone, as Peter discovers that Fudge may turn out all right, after all.</p>
        <p>On our way out, we ran into a mother whose daughter attends school with mine. Before I could introduce Matthew, he introduced himself. ''I'm the annoying little brother,'' he said with a grin.</p>
        <p>''Superfudge,'' tomorrow and Sunday at 12:30 p.m. at the Auditorium at Equitable Tower, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 627-7373. Tickets: $19; $15 when buying season tickets.</p>
        <p>Shake It Up!</p>
        <p>This weekend Wave Hill, the public garden in the Bronx, is inviting families to get acquainted with cucurbits (pronounced KYOO-cur-bihts). Now if you're thinking that the last thing you need is another breakfast cereal, you're way off. Cucurbits are neither a grain product nor a Spanish cockroach. They are the plant family that includes gourds and squashes, and they will be the stars of the garden's fall festival.</p>
        <p>Plaza de Calabaza -- or in the less poetic English, Gourd Place -- will offer recipes, growing tips and delicious dishes. Adrian Garcia will display his gourd sculptures and masks, and Chano Rodriguez will build maracas and sekeres, both gourd instruments. Jimmy Cruiz and the Spirit Ensemble will also play percussion.</p>
        <p>''The cool thing about a gourd is that it is already a shaker,'' said Stephanie Ehrlich, the garden's assistant director of public programs. ''The seed area dries up inside. If you shake the gourd, it comes loose.''</p>
        <p>Children will decorate their own gourd shakers and make paper crowns inspired by cucurbits. ''Last year they made a band and then built up,'' Ms. Ehrlich said. ''It looked as if they had zucchinis on their heads.''</p>
        <p>Young visitors will also enjoy a real plaza de calabaza, a mini-marketplace where they can collect gourds and pumpkins to be weighed and traded for ''gourd bucks.'' They can use the play money to buy pepitas (baked pumpkin seeds) and yerba mate, a South American herbal tea. Consider it a lesson in capitalism as well as in cucurbits.</p>
        <p>Plaza de Calabaza, tomorrow and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. at Wave Hill, 249th Street and Independence Avenue, Riverdale, the Bronx, (718) 549-3200. Free with admission: $4; students and the elderly, $2; members and ages 5 and under, free. Free from 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Northern Lights</p>
        <p>Imagine Iceland. It's safe to say that most Americans have never seen it, and that trying to picture it will lead to images of, well, ice. But the country has more to offer than wintry scenes, as special events over the next five weeks will show.</p>
        <p>They will take place at Scandinavia House: The Nordic Center in America, which opened on Tuesday in Manhattan. Its first programs will celebrate Iceland, starting this weekend with a Scandinavian Festival for Children and Families.</p>
        <p>''In some ways, Iceland is the least known of the Scandinavian countries,'' said Lynn Carter, executive vice president of the American-Scandinavian Foundation, which operates Scandinavia House. It is also, she added, the millennial anniversary of the visit to North America by that famous Icelander, Leif Ericson.</p>
        <p>The festival will include hourlong sessions of Icelandic tales tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. and Sunday at 1:30 p.m.  And on both days at noon and 3 p.m. the Icelandic Puppet Theater will present ''The World's Smallest Giant,'' featuring Hallveig Thorlacius, who might be called the Mary Poppins of the North.</p>
        <p>''She comes flying in on her umbrella; I'm not sure how she'll do that,'' Ms. Carter said. ''She's got an apron full of stories that have fallen out, and she interacts with the audience to get them back.'' Her characters include Leif the Lucky, a mouse.</p>
        <p>All events will take place in the Heimbold Family Children's Learning Center, which has a reading nook, computers, a prop-filled stage set and ''a full-size Viking made of Lego pieces,'' Ms. Carter said.</p>
        <p>Scandinavian Festival for Children and Families, tomorrow from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, near 37th Street, (212) 779-3587. Free.</p>
