You enjoyed sports, rock music, and life itself. All of us enjoyed every minute of the time you spent with us. Your laughter and your love has always been our most joyful and treasured inspiration. Your leaving is unbearable for us but your life and love will stay within us in memory and with enduring love.

We will miss you, Herbie. Love, Annie, Jake, Jeremy, Jay, Andrew, Aaron, Alex and Nessim KLEINMAN-Herbie. The Calhoun School deeply mourns the loss of Herbie Kleinman, Class of 1989.
