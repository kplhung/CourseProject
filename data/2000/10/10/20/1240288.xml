        <p>Two days after Gov. George E. Pataki declared that he opposed any significant increase in property taxes as part of Nassau County's fiscal solution, the state comptroller sternly criticized his stance yesterday.</p>
        <p>The comments by Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat who has been lining up support for a possible run for governor, took to a state level the tug of war that has been waged for the last few months by Nassau's Democratic and Republican leaders.</p>
        <p>In a scathing letter to the chairman of the state board overseeing the county's effort to solve its fiscal crisis, Mr. McCall warned that it was not his place, or Mr. Pataki's or the board's, to second-guess local policy decisions, like cutting spending or raising taxes. He told the chairman of the state board, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, that those choices were best left to the officials elected by county voters.</p>
        <p>''I am appalled by the message sent by the governor that any increase in Nassau County's taxes is unacceptable,'' Mr. McCall wrote to Frank G. Zarb, whom Mr. Pataki appointed last spring to head the oversight board, ''and it would be inappropriate for any member of the NIFA board to echo that sentiment publicly.''</p>
        <p>In May, the Republican governor offered the county $100 million in aid and a restructuring of its crushing $2.6 billion debt if county leaders cut hundreds of millions of dollars in spending through 2004. He said then that a tax increase would not be necessary.</p>
        <p>But the Democrats who control the County Legislature said this week that as part of their four-year rescue plan, they would seek a 16.3 percent increase next year in the county portion of property tax bills.</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki responded on Tuesday by saying at an Albany news conference that ''a massive property tax increase is clearly the wrong way to go'' and that he opposed any ''significant'' increase.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCall, who has critiqued the county's finances for seven years and appointed one of the seven members of the state board, said in an interview yesterday that he was not recommending a tax increase.</p>
        <p>Rather, he said, he objects to Mr. Pataki's eliminating tax increases as an option. And he said that since all of the state's taxpayers would contribute to bailing out Nassau County -- via Mr. Pataki's proposal -- it would be unfair if Nassau residents did not pay their share.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, an aide to Mr. Pataki  said it was Mr. McCall's position that was unsettling. ''It seems very clear to me that the state comptroller is endorsing a 17 percent tax increase on the people of Nassau County,'' said Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's director of communications, ''and that is shocking and appalling. As the governor made clear, the state did not provide tens of millions of dollars to Nassau County so they could propose a very significant tax increase on the people of Nassau County.''</p>
        <p>With the county facing a huge budget deficit and the threat of the state board seizing fiscal power from elected officials, Thomas S. Gulotta, the Republican county executive, submitted a 2001 budget last month that sought a 3.8 percent increase in county property taxes, which make up 19 percent of a county household's total tax bill.</p>
        <p>But the state board criticized Mr. Gulotta's plan, and Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the legislature's presiding officer, released a plan this week calling for a 16.3 percent increase. The Republican lawmakers, led by Peter J. Schmitt, said a tax increase of only 5 percent was necessary.</p>
        <p>But as the Democrats moved toward passing their budget plan -- in a vote originally scheduled for last night -- Mr. Zarb telephoned the county's three leaders Wednesday evening and negotiated a one-week delay so the three could try to reach a consensus.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Ms. Jacobs applauded Mr. McCall's letter.</p>
        <p>''When you hear the governor talk about a tax increase in a negative way, no matter what tax increase it is, then I feel that is stepping into the fray,'' she said. ''Any element of politics on the part of the governor, or NIFA, or anybody else involved in this process is not only totally unacceptable, but an insult to the people.''</p>
        <p>Robert W. Lazaro, a spokesman for Mr. Schmitt, declined to comment on Mr. McCall's letter.</p>
        <p>''We are staying above the fray,'' he said. ''You've got the governor, you've got the state comptroller and the next thing you know you'll have George Bush and Al Gore weighing in.''</p>
        <p>Gary Lewi, a spokesman for the state board, declined to comment on Mr. McCall's remarks.</p>
        <p>But in his letter, Mr. McCall also urged the state board to ''help the county executive and the legislature reach responsible consensus.'' That consensus is what the board's chairman, Mr. Zarb, has sought for months.</p>
