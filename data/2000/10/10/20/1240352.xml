        <p>Michael Rosenfeld Gallery  24 West 57th Street  Through Oct. 28</p>
        <p>They frequented different circles and were almost a generation apart in age, but Charmion von Wiegand (1896-1983) and Blanche Lazzell (1878-1956) shared an early devotion to modernism. Von Wiegand's work was more rigorously avant-garde than Lazzell's, whose exposure was somewhat earlier, but both worked hard to break with tradition. And it is evident, in the separate shows here, that their art more than held its own in the then supermacho world of American modernist art.</p>
        <p>A journalist and critic who dabbled in realist painting, von Wiegand changed her approach after studies with the Dutch modernist painter Piet Mondrian in the early 1940's. He convinced her of the spiritual value of abstract art and encouraged her to abandon writing for painting. Some of her earliest work in this show, titled ''Spirituality in Abstraction'' and covering the years 1945-69, is very much in the Mondrian mode, using his grid and a carefully controlled color scheme. An example is ''Untitled'' (1946), in which neat squares and rectangles of varying sizes in blue, gray, yellow and ocher are spaced by those in white.</p>
        <p>Surrealism also got into her work, and a lively painting of 1945 (also untitled) is cued by Mondrian's spatial arrangements and bright colors but with amoebic-looking, free-form images that float on a flat field. And then there was Kandinsky. Von Wiegand's admiration for the Russian theorist is manifest in a 1946 painting that takes cues from his sprightly play with bars, triangles and biomorphic doodles on a neutral surface.</p>
        <p>By the 1950's, the spiritual movement of theosophy embraced by Kandinsky and Mondrian was affecting von Wiegand, along with a growing interest in Eastern philosophies. A wonderful small gouache, ''Astrological Chart'' (1957), is a close-knit all-over arrangement of tiny pictographs that looks like a chart of mystical mathematical formulas. In later paintings she was  influenced by the rigid form of the Tibetan mandala, whose circles, squares and tight symmetries symbolized the complexity and wholeness of the universe.</p>
        <p>Her own paintings became symmetrical arrangements around an elongated central axis, and the colors varied wildly, as in ''Offering of the Universe'' (1964), whose discs, triangles and other geometric forms are arranged in a perfectly balanced image that suggests a universal clock. In it warm, sunny hues are played off against cool ones on a solid black ground. If von Wiegand's work is too cerebral, too derivative, to have much spontaneity, it still records in vibrant terms a lifelong attempt to infuse her art with spiritual meaning.</p>
        <p>Blanche Lazzell, a modernist advocate born in West Virginia, studied in Europe and then spent some 40 years in the Provincetown art colony. She is probably best known as a printmaker whose color woodcuts are distinguished by the fine white incised lines that define their Cubist-influenced imagery. Several original woodblocks from which she made prints -- still lifes, a landscape and an abstraction -- are in this exhibition, small compositions of graceful, delicate forms stained with muted color.</p>
        <p>Her show takes on more dimension with the inclusion of some of her paintings and drawings. A mellow oil on wood from 1929, ''Untitled (Cubist Composition),'' melds geometric and biomorphic forms in tans, grays and yellows, and a smaller, more complex painting of 1928, ''Untitled (Abstract Composition),'' is a sophisticated layering of form on form a la Picasso and Braque.</p>
        <p>Lazzell's Cuboid paintings and drawings of nudes, done in Paris in the 20's, are handled with animation, and her strong representational drawings of hills in West Virginia and backyards in Provincetown show a fine sense of rhythmical massing. Like von Wiegand more influenced than influencing, she was still firm about following her avant-garde instincts, and she produced an interesting body of work.</p>
