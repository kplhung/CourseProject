        <p>The homeboys hit the street at 5 the other morning before the sun and the shooters had a chance to get up and out.</p>
        <p>''This is a real hot spot right now,'' their driver, Robert Olvera, 30, said, pointing down a dark block in East Los Angeles.

        <p>The homeboys hit the street at 5 the other morning before the sun and the shooters had a chance to get up and out.</p>
        <p>''This is a real hot spot right now,'' their driver, Robert Olvera, 30, said, pointing down a dark block in East Los Angeles. ''An 18-year-old dude and a 10-year-old girl got killed here last week over some writing on the wall. The little girl just got caught up in the cross-fire. She was riding a scooter. Graffiti ain't no joke.''</p>
        <p>From 5 a.m. to 1 p.m., Mr. Olvera, with Johnny Ortega, Raul Barajas, George Gardea and David Martinez, cruises the struggling streets of East Los Angeles in a battered blue van, jumping out to paint over gang graffiti on churches, schools, porches, light poles and garage doors.</p>
        <p>They call themselves, the Homeboy Graffiti Removal Crew.</p>
        <p>All of the men, except for Mr. Gardea, who, at 23, has never been in a gang, are former gang members, with the tattoos, battle scars and jail records to prove it. They work at $9 an hour for a job training and violence prevention agency called Homeboy Industries, which has a city contract to remove graffiti.</p>
        <p>The agency's motto is ''Jobs not Jails.''</p>
        <p>Homeboy Industries, which provides job training, was founded and is run by Father Gregory J. Boyle, a Jesuit priest who has been working with current and former East Los Angeles gang members for years. He has also been burying them for years. He has officiated at more than 70 of their funerals and many of the young men Father Boyle has laid to rest were killed because of some barely legible scrawling on a wall.</p>
        <p>The gangs use graffiti to mark turf and to show disrespect for enemies. They challenge each other to gunfights by writing, ''Let's play'' and they say goodbye to fallen homies with ''R.I.P.'' -- rest in peace.</p>
        <p>They take a perverse, murderous pride in their spray painting and so in Father Boyle's neighborhood, removing graffiti can be a matter of life and death. ''The guys get up so early to go into the hottest neighborhoods while the gang members are still asleep,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The graffiti crew has to be on constant alert for vicious pit bulls and angry gang members, who do not take kindly to their spray-painted declarations being tampered with by rival gangs or former gang members, trying to do the right thing.</p>
        <p>''A lot of young guys, carrying nines and AK's are in junior high and the graffiti really gets them worked up,'' Mr. Olvera said, referring to 9-millimeter pistols and AK-47 assault rifles. ''They carry a spray can in one hand, a gun in the other.''</p>
        <p>The crew has been operating since July and has had no serious run-ins with gang members over graffiti.</p>
        <p>''When we run into our homeboys, they ask us don't paint,'' Mr. Ortega, 32, said. ''We tell them it's our job and we're trying to do something for the little kids and the neighborhood. But as soon as we leave, they write over it again.''</p>
        <p>The men travel with a drab rainbow of paint in the truck -- Fresno green, downtown brown, red brick red, cowhide beige, whale gray, a different color for any surface.</p>
        <p>''Brick red on this?'' Mr. Barajas, 22, asked as he grabbed a can of paint and a roller.</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' Mr. Olvera said. ''But don't get any paint on that truck.''</p>
        <p>To get to the graffiti the crew often has to scale fences, climb on trucks and squeeze between parked cars.</p>
        <p>But crew members do not just remove gang graffiti.</p>
        <p>''We take it all down. We take down a lot of those Nazi signs,'' Mr. Olvera said.</p>
        <p>''And in one area there's this Satanist,'' Mr. Ortega added. ''He's always writing 666 on a church.''</p>
        <p>By 9 the other morning, the crew had made 27 stops, including a wall the men had cleaned the day before.</p>
        <p>As gang members, the men wrote on dozens and dozens of walls.</p>
        <p>''I never thought that I was hurting somebody else's property,'' Mr. Martinez, 26, said. ''But now I'm doing some good and I love it. It's the first job I ever had. Nobody would hire me because I had felonies on my record.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Martinez and the other men hope the part-time member of their crew, Fernando Gonzalez, 14, will learn from their mistakes.</p>
        <p>Fernando was caught ''tagging,'' as painting graffiti is called, and sent to Father Boyle by school officials to do community service removing graffiti. He starts at 9 a.m.</p>
        <p>The other day, Mr. Martinez, who has three children, led Fernando through a forest of graffiti-scared light poles.</p>
        <p>''It's hard, but I've learned stuff,'' Fernando said.</p>
        <p>''Like what?'' Mr. Martinez asked, pointing to a spot Fernando had missed.</p>
        <p>''I learned not to tag no more,'' Fernando said, climbing on his tip toes to reach the spot. ''I don't want to do this again.''</p>
