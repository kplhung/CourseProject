        <p>The low-inflation new economy is up against an old-economy challenge -- a surge in oil prices -- and so far the new economy is holding its own, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan said the effects on the economy from higher oil prices have been modest so far. And the Fed chairman said there had been almost no effect on inflation expectations, reducing the chances the oil prices could set off a destabilizing spiral of rising wages and prices.</p>
        <p>In an address here to a conference on monetary policy sponsored by the Cato Institute, a conservative research group, Mr. Greenspan suggested that he saw nothing happening in the economy that would lead the Fed to raise interest rates anytime soon -- or reduce them.</p>
        <p>He repeated his optimistic view that the growth rate of productivity was still accelerating as technological advances work their way through the economy. Higher productivity growth means that companies are producing more with the same amount of labor, allowing them to pay higher wages and maintain or expand profit margins without raising prices. But he warned about long-term challenges to continued prosperity. One is that the surge in productivity will eventually abate. The other is that the benefits to the economy of the federal government's running a large budget surplus are likely to be tempered because the two parties seem intent on using much of the projected surplus for tax cuts or new spending.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Greenspan, the Fed has bet over the last several years that the economy is capable of higher rates of noninflationary growth than traditional economic theory would allow. The country has been rewarded by a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.9 percent, a 30-year low; rising wages; and subdued inflation.</p>
        <p>But against a backdrop of a rapidly changing economy, Mr. Greenspan said, ''it is essential that we not be deluded into believing that we have somehow discovered the Rosetta stone of monetary policy.''</p>
        <p>For one thing, economists get reams of data about old-line manufacturing activities but are still struggling to get good information about developments in the technology side of the economy, especially in fields like software development, the Fed chairman said.</p>
        <p>''So it is with some irony that just as we are adapting our old-economy models to the new realities, in drifts an apparition from the past -- a spike in oil prices that has potential implications for economic stability and for monetary policy,'' Mr. Greenspan said. The economy today is far less dependent on energy than it was in the early 1970's, when an oil price shock set off a recession, Mr. Greenspan said.</p>
