        <p>Given the two prevalent baseball themes on people's minds, it was not surprising that Johnny Kucks was asked by a friend the other day if he recalled how long it took for him to pitch the last Subway Series game 44 years ago.</p>
        <p>Kucks, who threw a three-hit shutout as the Yankees defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers in Game 7 of the 1956 World Series, told his friend to call back in an hour after he dug out the clippings in his basement.</p>
        <p>''Two hours and five minutes,'' Kucks said. ''And the score was 9-0.''</p>
        <p>That, of course, was back when the World Series was a game, a day game, and not a commercial overload stretching well past prime time, into tomorrow. When Kucks, a Jersey City native, came to the Yogi Berra Museum today to reminisce with the man who caught the biggest victory of his major league career, they agreed that it is not all television's fault.</p>
        <p>The 67-year-old Kucks was inclined to place equal blame on the invention of Velcro.</p>
        <p>''They get out of the box and I don't know what the heck they're doing,'' he said, mimicking batters who rewrap the contraptions on their elbows and wrists.</p>
        <p>Berra, who will probably throw out the first pitch in one of the games this weekend at Yankee Stadium, added that he didn't get home from the Yankees' pennant clincher Tuesday night until 2:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>''They've got to do something about this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>They played in a simpler, more romantic era, Berra and Kucks did, even if they didn't ride the subway to Ebbetts Field for Game 7. ''We drove to the Stadium and took a bus,'' said Kucks, who didn't know he even had the assignment until Casey Stengel left the ball in a cleat, inside his locker.</p>
        <p>Kucks, who joined the Yankees in 1954 and had a 54-56 record during a career that ended in 1960 with Kansas City, recalled how he almost didn't make it out of the first inning. With runners on first and second, he looked out to the bullpen to see Whitey Ford and Tom Sturdivant warming up. He got out of the inning on a double play ball, and two two-run homers by Berra helped him coast.</p>
        <p>After all these years, the journeyman pitcher turned stockbroker turned salesman still knew how to defer to the star.</p>
        <p>''If Yogi put down one finger, I threw the fastball,'' he said. That day, he said, Berra called a ''flawless'' game, 80 percent sinkers, and the Dodgers were history, even if Game 7 was never deemed historic.</p>
        <p>That was because in Game 5, Berra had called a perfect game, from another journeyman pitcher. Don Larsen's all-time gem may have obscured Kucks's striking performance in the decisive game, earning him a new car, but Kucks went home to Jersey City to a hero's welcome and a parade.</p>
