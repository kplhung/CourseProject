        <p>Anti-dam crusaders, including the novelist Arundhati Roy, expressed sorrow today that a Supreme Court decision will allow the long-stalled construction of a huge dam on the Narmada River to resume. They say the dam project will destroy the homes and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands whose needs have been neglected.</p>
        <p>But the grief of the dam's opponents was matched by the joy of villagers, farmers and politicians in the drought-afflicted state of Gujarat who believe the dam will bring drinking water to thousands, irrigate millions of acres of parched farmland and bring prosperity to parts of the state that now depend on undependable rains for their water.</p>
        <p>Gujarat's chief minister, Keshubhai Patel, told a jubilant crowd in the city of Ahmedabad today that construction would resume on Oct. 31.</p>
        <p>The Narmada project has become a high-profile test of conflicting views about big dams in the developing world: Do the benefits they bring outweigh the loss of the forests and villages that they submerge?</p>
        <p>In its ruling Wednesday, the Supreme Court came down heavily on the side of the Sardar Sarovar dam in Gujarat, saying that such projects had made the country ''more than self-sufficient in food,'' and that ''famines which used to occur have now become a thing of the past.''</p>
        <p>It ruled that the height of the dam can be raised in phases from 290 feet to as high as 452 feet, with each major step requiring the approval of forestry and environmental officials.</p>
        <p>By a 2-to-1 vote, the court rejected a petition filed six years ago by a private group called the Save the Narmada Movement. It rejected the group's contention that the dam had damaged the environment, though the dissenting judge argued that construction should be halted to allow for further environmental studies.</p>
        <p>The court did, however, note a grievance committee's finding that the state of Madhya Pradesh -- a beneficiary of the dam project -- had not done enough to acquire land for the resettlement of those whose property would be inundated.</p>
        <p>The judges ordered the governments of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra to care for those displaced by the rising waters. Any disputes over treatment of the displaced that cannot be resolved by dam authorities are to be referred to the prime minister, whose decisions will be final, the judges ruled.</p>
        <p>The Sardar Sarovar dam is part of a vast project in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh to build a network of 3,200 dams -- including 30 large and 135 medium-sized ones -- on the Narmada and its tributaries.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the Save the Narmada Movement rushed to the Narmada Valley today to plan a new strategy.</p>
        <p>''The nonviolent struggle will continue,'' said Medha Patkar, who leads the group and who has been fighting for the rights of those in the dam's path for the past 15 years. ''We are now moving from the battle to the war.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Roy, who joined the campaign over a year ago, said the dam project would lead to ''a horrible spiral of dispossession and uprootment.''</p>
        <p>Speaking in New Delhi, she said she believed people in the Narmada Valley would keep fighting.</p>
        <p>But the views of the dam opponents are far from universally shared, even among those who have joined movements on behalf of farmers and the lower castes. As the debate has heated up over the past year, some have argued that dams can improve the lot of struggling farmers and help India continue to produce enough food to keep up with its growing population.</p>
