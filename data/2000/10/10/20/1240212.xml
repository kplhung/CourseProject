        <p>And there you have it: Game One of the World Series. I'm Bob Costas, and with me is our analyst Joe Morgan. Joe, who won?''</p>
        <p>''It certainly wasn't the fans. I saw a boring game. Neither team looked championesque. But no major gaffes. Obviously, both clubs were heavily coached, but this gave fans a chance to see them without the so-called media filter. Also, coming into this game, the Mets' expectations were a bit lower, so no matter how the game is scored, this is a victory for them.''</p>

        <p>And there you have it: Game One of the World Series. I'm Bob Costas, and with me is our analyst Joe Morgan. Joe, who won?''</p>
        <p>''It certainly wasn't the fans. I saw a boring game. Neither team looked championesque. But no major gaffes. Obviously, both clubs were heavily coached, but this gave fans a chance to see them without the so-called media filter. Also, coming into this game, the Mets' expectations were a bit lower, so no matter how the game is scored, this is a victory for them.''</p>
        <p>''Thanks, Joe. We go now to Michigan, a key battleground state, where our group of 12 undecided fans is standing by with Skip Carey. Skip?''</p>
        <p>''Yes, Bob, I'm here in the Wayne State University student union in Detroit with our undecided fans. As you may know, no Yankee team has ever taken the World Series without doing well in Michigan, so the opinions of those here tonight are important. O.K., did any of you see a clear winner tonight? Randy! Randy Carter, the 37-year-old carpenter?''</p>
        <p>''Yes. Both teams hit hard in the first two innings, but I saw the Yankees as stronger on defense, so I put them ahead on my scorecard.''</p>
        <p>''I can see Marsha Ellis, registered nurse and single mother of three, shaking her head. She's a lifelong American League fan who's thinking of switching. Marsha?''</p>
        <p>''I didn't like the bean balls. I'm tired of all the personal attacks. Also, I don't see why the Yankees must adjust their clothing on national TV. On that note, the Mets won.''</p>
        <p>''There you have it, a split on the winner. Back to you, Bob.''</p>
        <p>''Thanks, Skip. We now have the results of our instant poll, and it's too close to call. Of 373 registered fans nationwide, 37 percent said the Mets won and 36 percent said the Yankees, a difference that falls outside the 17 percent margin of error. Nevertheless, a key here is the 15 percent undecided group. Joe Morgan?''</p>
        <p>''Well, Bob, a breakout of the numbers shows women more likely to think the Mets were victorious, but fans between 18 and 25 more inclined to pick the Yankees. The Mets scored well among the elderly, military veterans and those who oppose the designated hitter.''</p>
        <p>''We'll take a short break. Coming up after these messages, our World Series coverage continues when Jim Gray's Truth Squad studies, 'Were the pitches really strikes?' ''</p>
