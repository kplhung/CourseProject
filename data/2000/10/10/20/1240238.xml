        <p>Forty-four years ago, Bob Wolff was the voice of the Washington Senators when he landed his biggest national break: the Gillette Safety Razor Company chose him to call the World Series alongside Bob Neal, a Cleveland Indians announcer.</p>
        <p>Wolff couldn't know it then, but the 1956 World Series would be the last Subway Series for 44 years. The Yankees were battling the Brooklyn Dodgers for the sixth time in a decade ''and the whole city was stirred up about it,'' he said. A clean-speaking gent, he remembered generally good-natured taunting between fans back then, not the foul-mouthed trash-talking of today.</p>
        <p>A Yankees-Dodgers World Series was a familiar sight for the 16-team major league universe, unlike the first World Series pairing of the Mets and Yankees that begins tomorrow night in the Bronx. ''There seemed to be no greater hysteria than a Subway Series,'' Wolff said. ''These teams were full of Hall of Famers, and here were the Dodgers with Pee Wee and Duke and Jackie and Gil.''</p>
        <p>The voices of Wolff and Neal were heard on the Mutual radio network and carried locally on three stations: WOR, Mutual's local flagship; WINS, the Yankees' station; and WMGM, which aired the Dodgers.</p>
        <p>Wolff and Neal weren't a team, exactly. Each man narrated a half-game apiece, with little or no byplay from his partner. They alternated who started and ended each game.</p>
        <p>''You didn't want to encroach on the other guy,'' said Wolff, whose career continues today as the sports director of News 12 on Long Island. ''In those years, they were still putting two play-by-play announcers together. There were no color commentators. So there was a lot of competition between the two.''</p>
        <p>On NBC, Vin Scully and Mel Allen called the World Series in similar fashion; the broadcasts averaged a 30.8 national rating, drawing 11.6 million television households at a time when only 38.7 million existed.</p>
        <p>The last time the World Series posted a 30.0 rating was in 1981, when the number of households totaled 81.5 million.</p>
        <p>Going solo was not unusual for announcers of that time -- and probably preferred. Listening to them 46 years later, Wolff and Scully sound utterly comfortable on their own, although a bit lonely. Television was encroaching on radio's turf, but Wolff said: ''The big feeling was that you were it. At the time, radio announcers were the big thing. They were the voices of the country.''</p>
        <p>By happenstance, Wolff called the second half of Game 5, when Don Larsen pitched his perfect game, and returned from a half-game break in Game 6 for the 10th inning, when Jackie Robinson's base hit, the last of his career, drove in the winning run. ''Somehow, I kept getting the lucky breaks,'' he said.</p>
        <p>During Game 7, Wolff recalled, three Yankee home runs routed the Brooklyn starter Don Newcombe in the fourth inning at Ebbets Field, and Newcombe drove home soon after with the sportswriter Milton Gross beside him in the passenger seat.</p>
        <p>''He wrote a column about Newcombe's ride home while listening to me doing the radio call,'' Wolff said, still beaming after all these years.</p>
        <p>Nearly a half-century later, Wolff and his News 12 crew will be in the Bronx and Flushing, filing reports and interviewing players.</p>
        <p>''I still get thrilled by things,'' he said. ''I was watching Timo Perez and marveling that here's a guy I didn't know about who has the daring to bunt on a 3-2 count. What he is doing is artistically satisfying.''</p>
        <p>The 14th Subway Series will be televised by Fox, and heard on radio locally on WFAN and WABC. ESPN Radio, which holds the national rights, will be heard in all markets except for New York; the announcers will be Jon Miller and Dave Campbell.</p>
        <p>The national response to the Yankees-Mets version of the Subway Series is hard to predict. It will rouse metropolitan-area fans and viewers into a predictable frenzy, probably achieving local Nielsen ratings of 50 or more, but will the nation care? Will a one-market showdown continue baseball's postseason ratings tumble?</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the crucial elements will be compelling stories and riveting games. If the Yankees and the Mets perform well, viewers will come. In 1985, the all-Missouri Kansas City-St. Louis World Series produced a 25.3 rating on ABC. Two years later, the Minnesota-St. Louis matchup generated a 23.9.</p>
        <p>For such a return, Rupert Murdoch, Fox's paterfamilias, would dress up as Santa and dandle kiddies on his knee at F.A.O. Schwarz.</p>
        <p>''This has a chance to be an event, a spectacle,'' said Joe Buck, who will call the games with Tim McCarver and Bob Brenly. ''We're excited about putting down stakes in New York and seeing what happens. It's a throwback. There's a great feel to it. You hope the games measure up.''</p>
        <p>Keith Olbermann, the host for the coverage, added: ''Mets and Yankee fans have trouble believing that this thing they've dreamed about as kids is really happening. They'll have trouble grasping it until the first pitch.''</p>
        <p>Fox plans to capitalize on the allure of the Subway Series by looking back on its history with taped segments in the pregame show and during the games. Ed Goren, the president of Fox Sports, said the number of such nostalgic insertions would depend upon how quickly the Series established itself. ''We'll let the Series evolve,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He would not say if he would bring Wolff or Scully to the booth for an inning or two of play-by-play.</p>
        <p>Buck, who calls Cardinals games with his father, Jack, said, ''If Mr. Wolff or Mr. Scully step into the booth, I'd be glad to step aside.''</p>
