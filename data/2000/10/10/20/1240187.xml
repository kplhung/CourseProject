        <p>THE panic sets in when the doors are locked.

        <p>THE panic sets in when the doors are locked. Five of the six characters in ''The Dinner Party,'' the exceedingly odd new melocomedy that opened last night at the Music Box Theater, have been wondering who has brought them together in a private room in an expensive Parisian restaurant.</p>
        <p>Now, with no way out, they are forced to conclude that they are at the mercy of someone very strange and possibly sinister. And if they were in a play by Pirandello instead of the famously affable Neil Simon, these characters might look out into the darkness of the theater, searching angrily for their author, to yell, ''J'accuse!''</p>
        <p>A carefully selected group of antagonistic guests; an unknown manipulative figure who plans to play them like chess pieces; a staggered series of increasingly fraught revelations: Mr. Simon has been this way before with his screenplay for ''Murder by Death'' (1976), the celebrity-studded sendup of the classic country house murder mystery. And at least some of the cast members assembled here, like the former sitcom stars John Ritter and Henry Winkler, would seem like naturals for a sequel to that movie.</p>
        <p>But make no mistake: with ''The Dinner Party,'' directed with much vigor and little subtlety by John Rando, Mr. Simon is playing the same game with a straight, even sorrowful face. Not that this precludes fusillades of those familiar Simon one-liners, which keep erupting even after you have expected them to stop, like the last kernels in a pan of popcorn. Nor is there any lack of shtick as old as the geriatric vaudevillians in Mr. Simon's ''Sunshine Boys.''</p>
        <p>Yet the prevailing spirit is rueful, a bewildered sense of the ways husbands and wives seem doomed to hurt each other. Tragedy and comedy are walking hand in hand here. The result, unfortunately, has the ungainliness of an entrant in a three-legged race.</p>
        <p>The most successful writer of Broadway comedies of the last half-century and a Pulitzer Prize winner for the wistful ''Lost in Yonkers,'' Mr. Simon is still largely known as the master of the quick comeback, someone whose style has now been thoroughly appropriated by television comedy. He obviously feels claustrophobic confined to this pigeonhole. Who can blame him? It's heartening to see that at 73 he is asserting his right to explore new territory while holding on to beloved staples of the classic Simon style.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, with ''The Dinner Party'' this kind of experimentation has produced a truly bizarre mutant. It's a French farce with a Brooklyn accent! It's a Strindbergian sexual slugfest with a laugh track! It's a worldly slice of whimsy a la Jean Anouilh with an all-American smile! A theatergoer unfamiliar with Mr. Simon's earlier work could be forgiven for assuming that Doc, the playwright's professional nickname, is short for Dr. Moreau, H. G. Wells's hybrid-making mad scientist.</p>
        <p>Frankly, when I heard that Mr. Simon had written an intermissionless play of dissonant relationships set in Paris, I cynically assumed that he was emulating the commercial success of ''Art,'' Yasmina Reza's intermissionless play of dissonant relationships set in Paris. But ''The Dinner Party'' is light years away from the tidy symmetry and minimalism of ''Art.'' To begin with, instead of being set in a starkly modernist apartment, ''The Dinner Party'' unfolds before walls decorated with the marzipan lovers of Fragonardesque murals.</p>
        <p>John Lee Beatty's set doesn't stint on the opulence found in Old World tourist-trap restaurants in Paris: there are the glittering chandeliers, the silver salvers, the lush pastels. The environment does not match the voices of those who inhabit it. Every time Mr. Winkler, in a rather endearing portrait of a nebbishy used-car salesman, introduces himself as Albert Donay -- the Albert pronounced a la francais -- it is an aural joke, since the accent is Brighton Beach.</p>
        <p>So, for that matter, is much of the early dialogue, in which three men who have never met before get to know one another through the traditional Simon volleys of insults. In addition to Mr. Winkler, the participants are Mr. Ritter, as the bookshop owner Claude Pichon, and Len Cariou as Andre Bouville, a men's clothing tycoon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rando has seen that the dialogue is delivered with deft timing, but there is little real sense of the personalities of these men. They are defined almost entirely by their irritability, their professions and their one-liners. Albert, who is also an abstract painter (of used cars), is the obligatory dim member of this vaudevillian interaction. Example: ''Do you like Fragonard?'' Claude asks. ''Not before dinner,'' Albert answers.</p>
        <p>Things perk up a bit with the arrival of the first woman, Mariette Levieux. She is a successful popular novelist played -- lucky for us -- by Jan Maxwell, who gives off a real French brittleness as well as a troubled emotional current that slices through the prevailing artificiality.</p>
        <p>The very creditable cast is rounded out by Veanne Cox as Yvonne Fouchet, the sort of hyper-intense neurotic who has become this actress's specialty, and Penny Fuller as Gabrielle, an elegant creature of a certain age and an iron velvet-gloved will. Since Mr. Simon's play is structured as an unveiling of mysteries, I won't say how these characters are connected, though connected they turn out to be, to the point of strangulation.</p>
        <p>With the arrival of the silky Ms. Fuller, the tone of the evening struggles plaintively toward a philosophical wryness about things sexual, toward the sensibility so exquisitely captured in the Ingmar Bergman movie ''Smiles of a Summer Night.''  It then takes a sharp turn into Edward Albee territory, with party games designed to pour salt on old wounds. So people wind up saying things like, ''Your womb became a receptacle of all my self-loathing.''</p>
        <p>It should be noted that such ugly declarations rest cheek by jowl with the kind of quips that have flooded the stage since the evening began, some funny, some stale. Straight line: ''Did you know that primates are more successful at choosing mates than we are?'' Punch line: ''That's because there're not as many lawyers in the jungle.''</p>
        <p>In top-form Simon comedies like ''The Sunshine Boys'' and the autobiographical ''Brighton Beach'' trilogy, the wisecracks feel like a natural part of the defensive armor of the people portrayed. In ''The Dinner Party,'' they often feel like the offerings of a veteran gag writer, hot off the word processor. As Andre says to Gabrielle, ''I feel like I'm talking to a machine that spits out poisoned tennis balls.''</p>
        <p>''The Dinner Party'' is filled with such lines, suggesting that Mr. Simon wants to tell us that he knows what he is doing and to bear with him, please. Indeed, this is surely his most artistically self-conscious play. When Mariette says that she is leaving before the party turns into farce, Andre answers: ''It's already farce. I think we're aiming for a much higher form of absurdity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon has the same aim. ''The Dinner Party'' obviously hopes to invert a traditional comic form to reveal the truly absurd messes that so many people make of their marriages. Mr. Simon, who has been married five times, has reason to consider this subject. But no matter how profound his intentions, the play keeps shifting into automatic pilot, reflexively delivering barbs that glide over the surface instead of piercing it.</p>
        <p>''The Dinner Party'' concludes on a tender, truly stirring note of pathos, bewilderment and affection for the foolish mortals who create such havoc for themselves. This sentimental moment is so palpably sincere, you wish you had been able to believe for a single instant in the events leading up to it.</p>
