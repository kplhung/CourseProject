        <p>THE gray images in the 30-second spot are stark, even disturbing.</p>
        <p>In front of a building that looks much like the New York Stock Exchange, waste paper swirls on an empty street. Inside, overturned computer monitors and blown-out trading stations lie on a garbage-strewn floor. Wires, ripped from the ceiling, dangle menacingly above. The place fairly reeks of desolation; no one, it seems, has been here in a very long time.</p>
        <p>Is it Wall Street after the apocalypse? Not exactly. Instead, the commercial envisions a future when traditional stock exchanges will no longer be necessary -- a future when  investors will turn instead to technology-driven marketplaces. It is entitled ''Ghosts,'' and it is a cornerstone of a new campaign by Bozell New York, a unit of True North Communications Inc., for Island, an online network of more than 400 broker-dealers.</p>
        <p>''You as an investor should want to go to a place where no middleman stands between you and your transaction,'' said Andrew Goldman, a spokesman for Island, in which Datek Online, the online brokerage firm, owns a majority interest. Known technically as an electronic communications network, or E.C.N., Island is a system in which brokers post buy and sell orders on an Internet site (www.island.com), where trades are conducted and where anyone who logs on -- the service is available to the public -- can see exactly what is going on. This kind of information, in turn, makes it easier for investors to spot price trends and to make informed investing decisions based upon real-time market conditions. It also eliminates the so-called specialists or market makers who act as go-betweens in traditional stock exchanges.</p>
        <p>''It is a way to assure transparency, and to put into place the greatest amount of investor security for the execution of trades,'' Mr. Goldman said.</p>
        <p>Specializing in small investors, Island, based on Broad Street in lower Manhattan, has been around for about three and a half years. For regulatory reasons, it does not yet handle many of the stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Nor is it the only such operation in the country, or even the biggest. That honor belongs to Instinet, a subsidiary of Reuters that handles mostly institutional trades. But Island is doing very well nonetheless, Mr. Goldman said, ''averaging 250 million shares a day,'' or ''12 percent of the daily Nasdaq marketplace.'' The company, which is paid 75 cents per 1,000 shares traded, is already profitable, he said.</p>
        <p>So why the ad campaign?</p>
        <p>Despite Island's early success, ''the subject matter is still pretty new to most people,'' said Tom Truella, who is managing the Island account for Bozell. ''We still have to get people's attention.''</p>
        <p>To do that, ''you need very simple, audacious messages,'' said David Nobay, the group creative director supervising the account. ''You're up against incredible ingrained institutions, and to challenge them is an enormous thing.''</p>
        <p>The challenge began this week, when Island began running its television spots. In addition to ''Ghosts,'' another commercial, entitled ''Auction,'' shows the sale of the dismantled equipment of an old-fashioned, presumably defunct, stock exchange -- everything from computer monitors to traders' jackets to boxes of ticker tape. And, as in ''Ghosts,'' where spooky music and even a little off-screen keening are featured on the soundtrack, the spot features a British-accented, voice-over announcer who intones portentously that Island is ''a faster, fairer'' marketplace, ''devoid of secrets.''</p>
        <p>Shades of George Orwell, indeed. But there is actually very little factual detail in the television campaign, which is to be supplemented in coming weeks by a third commercial, entitled ''Tourists,'' in which a bus loaded with sightseers is shown pulling up to the old stock exchange, only to discover -- surprise! -- that it is closed and out of business.</p>
        <p>''We considered telling the whole story on television,'' Mr. Nobay said, ''but we decided that telling people that there was an alternative way to trade was a big enough message.'' So those who are seeking more information should go to Island's Web site, which is listed in the commercials, or to a series of detailed print ads which will also be running, he said, beginning this week in Investors Business Daily.</p>
        <p>For now, that is the only place the print ads will run, with the television spots running exclusively on CNBC. Mr. Truella said that Island was committed to $10 million in spending over the next year and that media buys had already been made through the second quarter of 2001. ''We are trying to leverage our dollars as best we can with one network,'' he said of his television choice. ''But we are in a wait-and-see period now, and will constantly reassess, if necessary.''</p>
        <p>How will the campaign's success be measured?</p>
        <p>People can go to the Island Web site and sign up with brokers who use it, Mr. Goldman said, or they can find a form letter there to send to their brokers, urging them to join -- kind of an ''I want my MTV.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''We have very good relationships with the brokers, and we'll be hearing back about what's going on.''</p>
