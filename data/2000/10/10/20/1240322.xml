        <p>American warships visited the Yemeni port of Aden two dozen times even though there had been no security reviews of local harbor workers and Yemen's coast was known to be susceptible to entry by terrorists, defense and administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>Intelligence analysts with the United States Central Command did review overall security for ships visiting Yemen, but neither the American Embassy nor the Pentagon's Defense Logistics Agency required or conducted extensive vetting of Yemeni port workers, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Investigators in Yemen have not yet determined how a small harbor boat packed with explosives managed to cripple the destroyer Cole a week ago, but officials in Washington are questioning whether security lapses may have given the attackers an opportunity to strike.</p>
        <p>What, if any, lapses occurred will be the focus of an independent investigation that the Pentagon announced today would be led by two former commanders, Adm. Harold W. Gehman and Gen. William Crouch. The apparent lack of scrutiny of port workers and the overall assessment of the port's safety will be among the questions they investigate, the officials said.</p>
        <p>The Cole entered Aden operating under standard procedures based on the level of threat in that port, and would have done the same in any port in the world where the threat was deemed comparable.</p>
        <p>''It would not be different from any other port where the threat condition was the same, depending on where they were tying up,'' a senior military official said today.</p>
        <p>Since the Cole's actions were standard, any findings of security shortcomings could lead to sweeping changes for American ships visiting ports around the world, not just  Aden.</p>
        <p>''I want to stress that we've said many times we will never have a perfect defense against terrorism,'' said the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon. ''But we need to make our defenses as good as they can be. And this panel is designed to help do that.''</p>
        <p>The decision to use Aden as a refueling stop for American warships headed for the Persian Gulf was the subject of an extensive and  at times charged debate at a hearing of the Senate's Armed Services Committee today.</p>
        <p>Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, who retired as commander of American forces in the region in August and who took responsibility for the decision, defended the refueling stops, saying Aden was safer and more strategically located than other ports he considered. At the same time, he acknowledged the risks from terrorism given that Yemen had little control over its borders and its port at Aden -- and the people who came and went through them.</p>
        <p>''Their coast is porous,'' he said. ''It's a sieve, as are their land borders.''</p>
        <p>The committee's Republican chairman, Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, underscored the point when he disclosed that Louis J. Freeh, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who visited Aden today, had told him that suspects identified by Yemeni authorities ''had been in and out of Yemen but just for a brief period.''</p>
        <p>Several senators questioned whether the United States had ignored what Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, called ''red flags'' about the safety and security of the port at Aden, in part to enhance diplomatic ties to Yemen.</p>
        <p>''We know there will be risks around this world and we have to be engaged around this world,'' said Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, another Republican. ''But did we take more risk than we needed to in this instance?''</p>
        <p>American warships began using the refueling station in Aden in March 1999 after negotiating a contract with the Arab Investment Manufacturing and Trading Company there. Since then 24 ships have refueled in Aden, officials said.</p>
        <p>Under its contract with a division of the Defense Logistics Agency, the company was required to provide security for its fueling facilities -- mainly, a Pentagon official said, to ensure the fuel was not tainted. The company was also responsible for the harbor boats used in mooring.</p>
        <p>None of its employees, however, were subjected to background checks or other security reviews -- something one Navy official suggested was not feasible in a place like Yemen. Officials declined to describe the extent to which such checks were routine at other foreign ports where Navy ships refuel.</p>
        <p>Since the boat that attacked the Cole appeared to have infiltrated the flotilla of boats assisting it as it docked, the company has become a focus of the investigation, a senior administration official said.</p>
