        <p>Clearly unfazed by the idea that she would be taking something that Josef Sudek did surpassingly well and putting her own stamp on it, Lois Conner has been using an old panoramic camera to take pictures of landscapes and peopled places that attest to the tonal riches of black-and-white photography. Sudek distilled the tugging poetry of Prague in what he delighted in calling his sausage-long views. Ms. Conner has been mirroring the ethereal beauty of Chinese vistas in her panoramic platinum prints.</p>

        <p>Laurence Miller Gallery  20 West 57th Street  Through Oct. 28</p>
        <p>Clearly unfazed by the idea that she would be taking something that Josef Sudek did surpassingly well and putting her own stamp on it, Lois Conner has been using an old panoramic camera to take pictures of landscapes and peopled places that attest to the tonal riches of black-and-white photography. Sudek distilled the tugging poetry of Prague in what he delighted in calling his sausage-long views. Ms. Conner has been mirroring the ethereal beauty of Chinese vistas in her panoramic platinum prints.</p>
        <p>Although this show, devoted to images taken mostly in China in the 1990's and accompanied by a book, ''China: The Photographs of Lois Conner'' (Callaway), displays Ms. Conner's superb command of the unwieldy banquet camera, it accentuates the advantages and disadvantages of this format. Since it is a deviation from the norm, the extra-wide or extra-long photograph has a built-in attraction. But even in expert hands an inevitable sameness sets in.</p>
        <p>''Lotus,'' the first part of this show, doubles the sameness quotient by including many variations of dried lotus leaves, with the sharp angles of the bent stalks echoed in their reflections on the still surface of the pond. The repetition is unfortunate as it dilutes the image's power. During a 1970 trip to Japan, Brett Weston had caught similar angles in a calligraphic image. By fleshing out the tangle of dried leaves and stalks and showing a mirror-smooth pond, Ms. Connor has created even more surreal images, as if nature, Calder-like, had whimsically strewn about wires bent in all kinds of angular shapes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Conner's panoramas in ''China,'' the second half of the show,  tend to be a wealth of beautiful tonal grays, but they also have a way of being superficially scenic. There are exceptions, like the extraordinary picture of the Gobi Desert in Gansu province. Here, exquisite gradations of light gray virtually compel the viewer to study every inch of this alien landscape and to marvel at the tiny resting figures of camels and their riders in a vast expanse of shifting sand.</p>
