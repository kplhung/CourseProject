        <p>It started like a normal night on the ''Late Show with David Letterman.'' Expecting Gov. George W. Bush as his guest, Mr. Letterman quizzed an audience member about Texas. He showed footage of the governor emerging from a black car. He brought up Mr. Bush's open-mike faux pas about a reporter.</p>
        <p>But quickly after that Mr. Letterman had a surprise for anyone who was expecting a normal night of comedy -- and from the look of it, Mr. Bush was also surprised. The host sharply questioned the Republican presidential candidate on the death penalty, violence in the Mideast and pollution in Texas. And he hardly seemed to be joking, even though he punctured his questions with his trademark laugh.</p>

        <p>It started like a normal night on the ''Late Show with David Letterman.'' Expecting Gov. George W. Bush as his guest, Mr. Letterman quizzed an audience member about Texas. He showed footage of the governor emerging from a black car. He brought up Mr. Bush's open-mike faux pas about a reporter.</p>
        <p>But quickly after that Mr. Letterman had a surprise for anyone who was expecting a normal night of comedy -- and from the look of it, Mr. Bush was also surprised. The host sharply questioned the Republican presidential candidate on the death penalty, violence in the Mideast and pollution in Texas. And he hardly seemed to be joking, even though he punctured his questions with his trademark laugh.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did get in some good lines. Asked whether he thought he had done well in the debate, he said, ''Well, a lot of folks don't think I can string a sentence together so when I was able to do so, the expectations were so low that all I had to do was say, 'Hi, I'm George W. Bush.''</p>
        <p>But soon Mr. Letterman was bearing in on the death penalty, saying, ''We make a lot of jokes about you electrocuting people in Texas,'' and asking whether there was some circumstance that would change Mr. Bush's position on capital punishment.</p>
        <p>''Well, obviously if the system were unfair, I'd think about it'' Mr. Bush said. ''You know it's a serious business. I hope that you're not laughing at the expense of victims or other people who are put to death of course.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Letterman pressed, ''Nothing you can imagine would cause a change of heart here?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he might change his mind if he did not think that executions saved lives.</p>
        <p>''Or perhaps if someone were wrongly executed?'' Mr. Letterman said.</p>
        <p>''Well, definitely on that, of course.''</p>
        <p>Soon the two were debating Mr. Bush's plan for oil drilling in a preserve in Alaska and smog in Texas.</p>
        <p>''Don't you have bad air pollution down in Texas,'' the host wondered.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said, ''It's getting better,'' and noted, ''We have a lot of cars.''</p>
        <p>At least Mr. Bush got to present a top 10 list of changes he would make in the White House, including giving the Oval Office ''one heck of a scrubbing.''</p>
        <p>A taping of a ''Saturday Night Live'' to be shown the weekend before Election Day went more as planned. But there had to be several retakes because Mr. Bush, usually a chronic word mangler, could not produce the effect on command. Told to mispronounce the word ''ambivalent'' for comic effect, he kept pronouncing it correctly.</p>
