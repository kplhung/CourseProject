        <p>Rod Schrock, left, has resigned as chief executive of AltaVista, the company said. AltaVista, an Internet portal that is majority-owned by CMGI Inc., said its president, Greg Memo, and chief financial officer, Ken Barber, would share Mr. Schrock's duties until a replacement was found. Last month, the company said that it would lay off 25 percent of its staff as part of cost-cutting measures aimed at saving as much as $120 million. Such steps are becoming increasingly common as Internet companies, concerned by the volatile stock market, focus less on rapid, expensive growth and more on profitability.</p>
