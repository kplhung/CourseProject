        <p>The yearning by New Yorkers for a Subway Series goes back to their grandparents' tales of the glory years when New York had three major league teams and the World Series was as much a part of its calendar as October itself.</p>
        <p>Of the 13 Subway Series going back to 1921, seven occurred in the 10 seasons from 1947 to 1956: the Yankees won six (five against the Brooklyn Dodgers, one against the New York Giants). The Dodgers won one, in 1955, their only World Series triumph as a Brooklyn franchise.</p>
        <p>To capsule those seven Subway Series, seven members of those Yankees, the Dodgers and the Giants were contacted for their recollections -- Al Gionfriddo, Jerry Coleman, Bobby Thomson, Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford, Johnny Podres and Don Larsen.</p>
        <p>1947</p>
        <p>The Dodgers lost to the Yankees in seven games, but the 5-foot-6-inch Al Gionfriddo, a reserve outfielder, twice was in the middle of the main moments.</p>
        <p>In Game 4 at Ebbets Field, Yankee right-hander Floyd (Bill) Bevens had a no-hitter and a 2-1 lead with one out in the ninth inning when he walked Dodger center fielder Carl Furillo; two of his eight previous walks had contributed to the Dodgers scoring a run without a hit. The next hitter, Spider Jorgensen, fouled out, and then Gionfriddo was sent in to run for Furillo.</p>
        <p>''Burt Shotton played hunches,'' Gionfriddo said of the white-haired Dodger manager who wore a tie and a white shirt in the dugout. ''Furillo was fast, but that season he missed stepping on second or third base seven times.''</p>
        <p>Taking his lead off first base, Gionfriddo saw the third-base coach, Ray Blades, grab his belt buckle: the steal sign.</p>
        <p>''I was confident,'' Gionfriddo said. ''Bevens's motion was slow and I could run the 100 in 10 flat in baseball shoes.''</p>
        <p>With Pete Reiser batting for pitcher Hugh Casey, Gionfriddo slid safely into second ahead of Berra's throw.</p>
        <p>''Now that first base was open,'' Gionfriddo said, ''Bucky Harris, the Yankee manager, had Reiser walked intentionally. I couldn't understand why; he was putting the winning run on base. I guess he didn't know that Reiser had a bad ankle and couldn't run. If he had lined one into right field, he might have been thrown out at first.''</p>
        <p>Shotton had Eddie Miksis, a reserve infielder, run for Reiser and sent up Harry (Cookie) Lavagetto as a pinch-hitter for Eddie Stanky.</p>
        <p>''Lavagetto swung at the first pitch and missed,'' Gionfriddo said. ''The second pitch, he hit it against that crazy wall in right field. Tommy Henrich played it to come off one way, but it went the other way and he had to chase it.''</p>
        <p>Gionfriddo and Miksis both scored and the Dodgers won, 3-2, on Lavagetto's double that broke up Bevens's no-hitter.</p>
        <p>The Dodgers would win Game 6 at Yankee Stadium, 8-6, after Gionfriddo had been inserted as the left fielder in the sixth.</p>
        <p>''They had two on with two out,'' Gionfriddo said. ''I looked in the dugout and Coach Clyde Sukeforth was waving me to play closer to the line. That's where I was when DiMaggio hit this towering shot to left center. I ran looking over my shoulder, jumped with my back to the plate, turned in midair and hit the bullpen gate with my butt at the 415-foot sign.''</p>
        <p>After rounding first, Joe DiMaggio kicked the infield dirt in a rare sign of frustration.</p>
        <p>''Whenever I saw Joe at dinners after that, he'd always kid me about taking a three-run homer away from him,'' Gionfriddo said. ''But if somebody asked me to sign that picture of me making the catch, he'd sign it too. I've signed thousands of that picture.''</p>
        <p>1949</p>
        <p>Game 1 with the Dodgers was a scoreless duel between the Yankees' Allie Reynolds and Don Newcombe, but as the Yankees came to bat in the bottom of the ninth, second baseman Jerry Coleman had hurried through the dugout tunnel to the clubhouse and the trainer's room.</p>
        <p>''I had something in my eye,'' Coleman said. ''I was putting eye drops in my eye when I heard this big roar.''</p>
        <p>Tommy Henrich, the Old Reliable right fielder, had hit a walk-off homer against Newcombe for a 1-0 victory.</p>
        <p>''Before the game,'' Coleman said, ''Casey Stengel told us, 'Don't try to pull this guy.' Big Newk could really throw hard, but Henrich pulled him into the lower right-field stands.''</p>
        <p>After Dodger left-hander Preacher Roe spun a 1-0 shutout against Vic Raschi, the Yankees won three straight at Ebbets Field.</p>
        <p>''I drove in the winning run in the ninth of Game 3,'' Coleman said, alluding to the 4-3 victory. ''Jack Banta had me no balls and two strikes and he laid one in there. He must've figured he could blow it by me.''</p>
        <p>In the fourth game, Ed Lopat and Reynolds combined to win, 6-4, and in the fifth, Raschi and Joe Page teamed for the 10-6 clincher in Casey Stengel's first season as the Yankee manager.</p>
        <p>''In mid-September that year, Casey and our pitching coach, Jim Turner, had a meeting with Reynolds, Raschi, Lopat, Byrne and Page,'' Coleman remembered. ''They told 'em that unless we were out of a game, they were the only five pitchers we were going to use the rest of the season. In that Series, they were the only five pitchers we did use. Why? Because they could pitch.''</p>
        <p>1951</p>
        <p>The day before, Bobby Thomson had hit ''the shot heard 'round the world,'' the three-run ninth-inning homer off the Dodgers' Ralph Branca that won the National League pennant for the Giants. Now, on his way into Yankee Stadium for the World Series opener, a fan approached him holding a baseball.</p>
        <p>''He told me: 'This is the ball you hit for the homer. I'll give it to you for two tickets,'' Thomson recalled. ''I hurried inside and asked Eddie Logan, our clubhouse man, how I could get two tickets. Eddie laughed and pointed to my locker. Half a dozen balls that I supposedly hit for the homer were there.''</p>
        <p>The Giants won the opener, 5-1, behind left-hander Dave Koslo and the third game, 6-2, behind Jim Hearn. But Lopat, Reynolds, Lopat again and Raschi pitched the Yankees to their third consecutive World Series triumph.</p>
        <p>1952</p>
        <p>Joe Black had been the Dodgers' ace relief pitcher during the season but their manager, Chuck Dressen, started him against the Yankees in the Ebbets Field opener. He won, 4-2, on a six-hitter.</p>
        <p>''Fastball, slider, good control,'' Berra remembered.</p>
        <p>Raschi responded with a 7-1 three-hitter, then Preacher Roe threw a 5-3 six-hitter at Yankee Stadium to keep the Dodgers ahead.</p>
        <p>''If Roe threw a spitball like he later said he did,'' Berra said, ''he didn't throw one to me. I hit a homer off him.''</p>
        <p>Reynolds outdueled Black with a 2-0 four-hitter in Game 4. Carl Erskine pitched an 11-inning, 6-5 five-hitter to put the Dodgers ahead, three games to two, going back to Ebbets Field. But Raschi and Reynolds combined to beat Billy Loes, 3-2.</p>
        <p>''That's the game Loes said he lost a grounder in the sun,'' Berra said.</p>
        <p>In Game 7, the Yankees used Lopat, Reynolds and Raschi to create a 4-2 lead in the seventh, but the Dodgers loaded the bases with one out, and Stengel called on lefty Bob Kuzava to face Duke Snider, who had tied a Series record with four homers. Snider popped up. So did Robinson, the ball high above the first-base side of the mound.</p>
        <p>''Joe Collins must've lost it,'' Berra said, referring to the Yankee first baseman. ''That's when Billy came running.''</p>
        <p>Realizing the ball might fall safely near the mound and at least one run would score, Martin, the second baseman, sprinted and caught it on the dead run. Kuzava breezed through the eighth and ninth.</p>
        <p>1953</p>
        <p>In the first inning of the opener at the Stadium, Martin's three-run triple off Erskine put the Dodgers in a 4-0 hole, and he also had two singles as the Yankees won, 9-5. In what would be the Yankees' record fifth straight Series title, his 12 hits would equal the Series record.</p>
        <p>The Yankees won Game 2 behind Lopat before Erskine returned at Ebbets Field to strike out 14, then a Series record.</p>
        <p>''In the dugout,'' Ford said, ''Johnny Mize kept telling our hitters: 'You got to lay off Erskine's curveball in the dirt. Don't swing at that curveball.' In the ninth, Casey sent him up as a pinch-hitter and he chased one curveball after another. He was the 14th strikeout.''</p>
        <p>In Game 4, the Dodgers pounced on Ford for three runs in the first and went on to a 7-3 victory. In Game 5, Mickey Mantle crushed a grand-slam off the right-handed reliever Russ Meyer into the upper deck in left-center field at Ebbets Field in an 11-7 rout as the Yankees took a 3-2 lead.</p>
        <p>''I can still see the trajectory of that grand slam,'' Ford said. ''It looked like a plane taking off. That was one of Mickey's greatest homers.''</p>
        <p>In Game 6, Martin's record-tying 12th hit, a single through the middle, knocked in Hank Bauer with the winning run in the ninth. As the Series' most valuable player, he was awarded a car by Sport magazine.</p>
        <p>''Billy went into the Army after that,'' Ford said. ''I think he left that car in the Bronx somewhere and they never found it.''</p>
        <p>1955</p>
        <p>Left-hander Podres had struggled to a 9-10 record, but after the Dodgers lost the first two games at Yankee Stadium, he pitched a seven-hitter for an 8-3 victory at Ebbets Field.</p>
        <p>''I'd had back, shoulder and rib problems,'' he said. ''But in the second inning, I told Billy Herman, our third-base coach, 'I got some kind of changeup today.' And when the game was over, Walt Alston told me, 'If there's a seventh game, you're my starter.' ''</p>
        <p>Alston, in his second year as manager, needed reliever Clem Labine to win Game 4, and then Labine saved starter Roger Craig the next day. But back at Yankee Stadium, Karl Spooner didn't last the first inning as Ford pitched a four-hitter.</p>
        <p>''Don't worry,'' Podres told shortstop Pee Wee Reese, ''we'll get 'em tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>With a 2-0 lead in the sixth inning of Game 7, Alston moved Jim Gilliam from left field to second base to replace Don Zimmer, who had been pinch-hit for, and inserted Sandy Amoros in left. Martin led off with a walk. Gil McDougald beat out a bunt. Yogi Berra was up.</p>
        <p>''I threw a fastball about 10 inches outside,'' Podres said, ''but Yogi reached out and sliced it high down the left-field line. I didn't know which base to back up, third or home.''</p>
        <p>On the run, the left-handed Amoros stuck out his glove, caught the ball and fired to Reese, who turned instantly and threw to Gil Hodges at first base to double up McDougald. Bauer grounded out.</p>
        <p>With two out in the ninth and Elston Howard up, catcher Roy Campanella called for a fastball.</p>
        <p>''That was the only time I shook Campy off the whole game,'' Podres said. ''I wanted to throw my changeup and Howard bounced it to Pee Wee.''</p>
        <p>The Dodgers and Brooklyn celebrated their first World Series championship far into the night. So much so that when Podres was asked what he remembered about the celebration, he laughed.</p>
        <p>''I don't remember nothin','' he said.</p>
        <p>1956</p>
        <p>In the opener at Ebbets Field, Gil Hodges's three-run homer off Whitey Ford helped to build a lead for right-hander Sal Maglie as the Dodgers won. In Game 2, right-hander Larsen had a 6-0 lead going into the bottom of the second inning, but the Dodgers knocked him out en route to a 13-8 triumph.</p>
        <p>''I got wild and Casey took me out,'' Larsen said. ''I walked too many batters to suit him and to suit myself. I was so bad, I didn't think I'd start again.''</p>
        <p>After Ford and Tom Sturdivant got the Yankees even, Larsen walked into the Yankee clubhouse for Game 5 to find a baseball in one of his spiked shoes. Stengel's third-base coach, Frank Crosetti, had put the ball there.</p>
        <p>''That's how you found out you were starting,'' Larsen said. ''Until then, nobody had told me anything. Casey had a hunch, I guess.''</p>
        <p>The first two Dodger batters, Jim Gilliam and Pee Wee Reese, looked at a third strike. Larsen's control had set the tone.</p>
        <p>''I didn't feel any different than I had in the second game, any better or any worse,'' he said. ''I give all the credit to Yogi. He gave me a great target and I hit the target. I had the best control I ever had. In the dugout in the seventh inning, I told Mickey, 'Look at the scoreboard.' ''</p>
        <p>On the scoreboard the Dodgers had 0 runs, 0 hits.</p>
        <p>''Wouldn't that be something?'' I said to Mickey.</p>
        <p>''He wouldn't even look at me after that,'' Larsen remembered. ''The whole dugout was like a morgue. I knew I had a no-hitter going. Every pitcher knows when the other team gets its first hit, but it really never occurred to me that I had a perfect game.''</p>
        <p>With two out in the ninth, Dale Mitchell, pinch-hitting for Maglie, who had pitched a five-hitter, looked at a third strike as the Yankees won, 2-0. Back in Ebbets Field, Labine pitched a 1-0 seven-hitter, then Johnny Kucks blanked the Dodgers, 9-0, in Game 7 as Yogi Berra hit two homers.</p>
        <p>''What Labine and Kucks did,'' said Larsen, ''they were the two best games I ever saw pitched.''</p>
        <p>Then again, Larsen never really saw the perfect game he pitched. He was too busy pitching it in the last Subway Series until now.</p>
