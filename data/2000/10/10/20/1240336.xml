        <p>Directed by Lane Janger  Not rated; 92 minutes</p>
        <p>In ''Just One Time,'' Lane Janger, the director and co-writer of the picture, plays Anthony, a New York firefighter living in premarital bliss with his fiancee, a lawyer named Amy (Joelle Carter). The prospects of their future happiness are clouded, however, by Anthony's persistent fantasy of sharing Amy's favors with another woman. With their wedding day approaching, the matter becomes urgent.</p>
        <p>According to Anthony's understanding of Catholic doctrine, the church would consider a menage a trois a violation of the vows of matrimony. An out-of-wedlock threesome, by his reasoning, would be O.K. This may come as news to the Holy See.</p>
        <p>Mr. Janger's film bravely addresses an issue that has been tackled many times before. There's a whole curtained-off section of your neighborhood video store devoted to it, but the definitive treatment came a few years back in a cluster of ''Seinfeld'' episodes. ''Just One Time,'' with its breezy jokiness, is more sitcom than smut, but at 90 minutes without a laugh track or commercial break, it hardly holds its own against an average episode of ''Dharma and Greg'' or ''Friends.''</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is that Mr. Janger, who writes some good jokes and isn't bad at pacing his scenes, doesn't have much comic presence as an actor.</p>
        <p>His droopy eyes and perpetual five o'clock shadow give him a degree of hangdog charisma, but his range doesn't extend much beyond anxious moping.</p>
        <p>He and the stiff, passive Ms. Carter never really seem like a couple. We're told that they love each other, but we never pick up a pulse of real feeling between them. The plot contrives to place all manner of comic obstacles between them and the altar, but it's hard to believe that anything is really at stake.</p>
        <p>What comic spark there is in this movie comes from the secondary characters, especially Jennifer Esposito and Guillermo Diaz, who play the leading candidates for the role of hypotenuse in Anthony and Amy's triangular fantasies. Amy agrees to indulge Anthony's desire on condition that he reciprocate, and Victor (Mr. Diaz), a young gay man who lives with his mother in Anthony and Amy's Lower East Side block, is happy to oblige.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Amy finds herself attracted to Michelle (Ms. Esposito), a furniture restorer and the block's resident lesbian. The middle of the movie follows the couple's his-and-her sexual identity crisis. The high point comes when Anthony, on his first ''date'' with Victor, brings some of his macho firehouse buddies to a gay bar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Janger's script generates multiple entanglements -- the arrival of Amy's globe-trotting hippie-ish parents, the tensions that arise between Anthony and his best friend, Dom (David Lee Russek) -- but his direction never achieves the nimble frenzy of farce that the material requires.</p>
        <p>At the end Anthony sprints through Lower Manhattan clutching a bouquet of daisies. By the time he reaches Amy, his face is haggard and his shirt soaked with sweat.</p>
        <p>Like him, ''Just One Time'' works hard at being charming, but comedy is best when it looks effortless.</p>
