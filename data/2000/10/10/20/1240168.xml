        <p>Mixing Cuisines</p>
        <p>In the culinary world, fusion cooking -- merging the elements of two or more cuisines -- is no longer popular as a buzz word, but the food itself certainly is. Established fusion restaurants are holding their own while new ones are opening all over town. These 12 restaurants that know no borders are among the best in the genre. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)</p>
        <p>1. Asia de Cuba</p>
        <p>* [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 726-7755</p>
        <p>237 Madison Avenue, at 37th Street</p>
        <p>Murray Hill</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The manic energy of this place makes every night feel like a party. The name says it all: a blend of Asian and Latin food. For an appetizer you can't beat the oxtail spring roll, a combination of rich meat and crisp pastry that comes with a black bean, cucumber and tomato relish. Thai beef salad is also admirable: spicy beef carpaccio with avocado, shredded coconut and orange segments. Entrees include Chinese five-spice sirloin, stuffed with scallions and ginger, and seared marinated lamb.</p>

        <p>2. AZ</p>
        <p>*** [Rating: 3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 691-8888</p>
        <p>21 West 17th Street</p>
        <p>Flatiron district</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>A to Z reflects the range of influences that Patricia Yeo, a Bobby Flay protegee, brings to her highly inventive, extroverted and wildly successful brand of fusion cooking, with dishes like duck schnitzel, and chicken smoked in Lapsang souchong tea leaves. AZ is gorgeous, an improbable but enchanting blend of strict Asian geometry, Art Nouveau and turn-of-the-century Viennese craft influences. The sultry bar and lounge on the ground floor attract the young and the beautiful. In the third-floor dining room, tilted glass panels open to the sky in clear weather, and a thin sheet of water flows down a stone slab near the entrance. It's a room to dream in, and a threat to steal the show. When the food arrives, however, the stargazing stops. After that, Ms. Yeo holds center stage.</p>
        <p>3. Boca Chica</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 473-0108</p>
        <p>13 First Avenue, at First Street</p>
        <p>East Village</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This little Pan-Latin restaurant brightens up an otherwise drab corner on the edge of the East Village. Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, Mexico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic are just some of the countries whose cuisines are juxtaposed on the enticing menu. Main courses come in huge portions, served with a mound of white or yellow rice and beans. Top choices include camarones chipotle, shrimp in a tomato, chili and cilantro sauce, given a rich, smoky note by the chipotle peppers; crisp, tangy chicharones de pollo, the classic Dominican dish of chicken pieces marinated in lime, soy and spices, served broiled rather than fried, as is traditional; and pinones, sweet plantains stuffed with a savory mixture of ground beef and pork.</p>
        <p>4. Kitchen/Market Bright Food</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 243-4433</p>
        <p>218 Eighth Avenue, at 21st Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>This restaurant stands out for its blending of Southwestern and Asian ingredients. Appetizers include the Tijuana Caesar salad with smoky corn bread croutons, and Vietnamese duck and guava taquitos with mango slaw and tamarind dipping sauce. Main courses include moo shu Mexican vegetable hand rolls with chipotle peanut sauce and rice, and banana leaf steamed Yucatan salmon with coconut basmati rice and mango slaw. Bright Food Shop also serves breakfast featuring dishes like cornmeal pecan griddlecakes, and huevos rancheros on corn tortillas.</p>
        <p>5. Cafe Asean</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 633-0348</p>
        <p>117 West 10th Street</p>
        <p>Greenwich Village</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>This charming little cafe combines the vogue for Pan-Asian menus with a pleasant, rustic American look and an eager-to-please staff. In fact, the hardest thing to like about Cafe Asean is the name, pronounced AH-see-ehn, after the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The menu is largely Vietnamese with a scattering of Malaysian and Thai dishes; the Vietnamese are the best bet. Bun tom, rice vermicelli with grilled shrimp, is perfectly cooked. Fresh salads of lettuce, basil and mint topped by grilled shrimp or slices of grilled beef are simple and satisfying.</p>
        <p>6. Komodo</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 529-2658</p>
        <p>186 Avenue A, near 12th Street</p>
        <p>East Village</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Komodo, which opened last November, is one of the city's few Mexican-Asian hybrids. In the hands of Maggie Moore, the chef, the combination of ingredients sparks culinary fire, and the fusion idea never outweighs the flavors on the plate. Appetizers include Asian guacamole spring rolls with roasted tomatillo salsa; tempura oysters with red bean-ancho sauce, and Korean beef satay with Indonesian peanut sauce over marinated grilled cactus. Entrees include grilled sirloin topped with oysters tempura and crispy leeks; roasted salmon with blood orange, guava and ginger cream; and snapper fillet wrapped in corn husks and grilled with chili-cilantro marinade. For drinks try one of the sake cocktails created by the restaurant to compliment the menu.</p>
        <p>7. March</p>
        <p>*** [Rating: 3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 754-6272</p>
        <p>405 East 58th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>March's celebrated chef and owner, Wayne Nish, has created an opportunity for culinary diversion by replacing the usual three-course restaurant menu -- appetizer, entree and dessert -- with one that allows you to choose from four to seven smaller courses. Several of Mr. Nish's dishes are variations on sushi and sashimi. They are so beautiful they look more like jewelry than food. More robust dishes include two kinds of foie gras: one is sauteed with szechuan peppercorns, chickpea puree and Chinese sausage; the other is made into a terrine, dusted with garam masala and served with papadum and Sauternes glaze; and venison with caramelized pearl onions and chanterelles in onion coulis.</p>
        <p>8. Pascalou</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 534-7522</p>
        <p>1308 Madison Avenue, near 92nd Street</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Pascalou could be termed multicontinental, since it strays into Asia and North America as well as many parts of Europe. The chef, Pascal Bonhomme, is French, but his food is eclectic. His pseudo-Caesar salad hits a lively note with the addition of pecans and apple. Lamb chops are Middle Eastern, spiked with cumin and served with couscous, while beef and shrimp salad is prepared Thai style, with basil, mint and peanuts. Stick-at-homes can fall back on roast chicken and mashed potatoes.</p>
        <p>9. Sono</p>
        <p>** [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 752-4411</p>
        <p>106 East 57th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>It's fusion overdrive at Tadashi Ono's French-Japanese hybrid, one of the most distinctive restaurants to open in 1999. The flavors are unusual, and the combinations arresting, but fundamentally Ono prizes simplicity and purity. Shrimp in the shell, stir-fried with yuzu zest and sweet-hot shishito pepper, for example, brings a fresh intensity to shrimp. Surprises abound, as in tuna sashimi with avocado and Dijon mustard, or the shockingly flavorful wasabi sauce that goes with the duck.</p>
        <p>10. Tabla</p>
        <p>*** [Rating: 3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 889-0667</p>
        <p>11 Madison Avenue, at 25th Street</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The newest of Danny Meyer's restaurants, Tabla vibrates with sound and sizzles with color. At the bar downstairs, cooks grill roti and nan in odd and interesting flavors. Upstairs the dining room is darkly sensuous, with walls stained in shades of jade and coral. Floyd Cardoz's menu features American foods transformed by Indian spices. Among the appetizers are eggplant and sweet pepper samosa, and tandoori shrimp with tomato sorbet, ginger, frisee and baby greens. Main courses include roasted lobster with two-colored amaranth, gingered risotto and toasted spice glaze; and spiced loin and braised shoulder of lamb. Desserts are impressively offbeat. Try the warm chocolate-almond cake or the vanilla-bean kulfi, an ice cream with character.</p>
        <p>11. Union Pacific</p>
        <p>** [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 995-8500</p>
        <p>111 East 22nd Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The extraordinary combinations of flavors and textures created by Rocco DiSpirito at this restaurant are startling and wonderful. His exciting menu, can provoke moans of pleasure as you eat. It features a bouillon of forest mushrooms; cauliflower pastilla (or bsteeya) with fresh herb puree; and bee-pollen-glazed duck with hearts of palm and fennel soubise. Almost everything on the menu is wonderful, and the unusual wine list emphasizes selections that are bright with enough acidity to make them friendly to this food.</p>
        <p>12. Vong</p>
        <p>*** [Rating: 3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 486-9592</p>
        <p>200 East 54th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Vong, Jean-Georges Vongerichten's foray into French-Thai fusion cuisine, is eight years old, but it seems as if it's been around for ages. With branches around the world, it has evolved into an institution, and its exhilarating combinations no longer seem as novel as they once did. Still, the chef's mastery of Asian seasonings can be tasted in many dishes, like perfectly balanced chicken and coconut soup, flavored with galangal and shiitake mushrooms; spiced cod with curried artichoke hearts; and lobster with Thai herbs. Mr. Vongerichten made a special mark with desserts like fruit salad with white pepper ice cream, in which the heat of the peppercorns creates a lovely sensation standing against the cool salad.</p>
