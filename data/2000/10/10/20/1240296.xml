        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio staked a claim on foreign policy and women's issues yesterday, meeting with Henry A. Kissinger and then, an hour later, plopping down on a couch with his wife for an interview with Barbara Walters and the other hosts of the ABC program ''The View.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Lazio, who has made no formal address on his foreign policy views during his Senate campaign, met privately at Mr. Kissinger's Park Avenue office in Midtown for about a half-hour. Afterward, Mr. Kissinger emerged with Mr. Lazio and expressed support for him, and the two spoke to reporters.</p>
        <p>The meeting occurred two days after an address on foreign policy that Mr. Lazio's Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, made in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''I had a very good conversation with Mr. Lazio,'' Mr. Kissinger said. ''And we reviewed a number of topics on the Middle East. It was a very instructive, very positive conversation, and I'm delighted to have been able to be of some assistance to him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kissinger said the United States should have vetoed a United Nations resolution this month that condemned Israel's use of force in the confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians, instead of abstaining from the vote. President Clinton mediated a truce between Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Tuesday, though skirmishes continued.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kissinger suggested that Mr. Clinton had been too ambitious in peace talks last summer. ''I respect President Clinton for the effort he made to bring about peace,'' he said. But at the same time, the president's game plan ''raised too many issues for the time that was available,'' he said. ''But I respect his effort.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kissinger did not directly criticize Mrs. Clinton, who on Tuesday outlined a foreign policy vision of ''a renewed internationalism, not an old isolation,'' particularly in humanitarian efforts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kissinger said, ''I believe that the United States should be engaged where there is a clear demonstration of the American national interest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, an unknown outside  Long Island until this race, has also been fighting a so-called stature gap in his competition with the first lady; though his appearance with Mr. Kissinger seemed to be an effort to close that gap, it also seemed to draw attention to it. Seven of the 11 questions asked at the news conference were directed to Mr. Kissinger.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and his wife, Patricia, went on to a live appearance yesterday on ''The View,'' a morning talk show in which Ms. Walters and four other women are the hosts. Mr. Lazio tried to join in the light banter: Ms. Walters shrieked in mock horror after he revealed he is a Mets fan. He faced questions about his performance in the candidates' first debate, in which he walked to Mrs. Clinton's lectern to urge her to sign a pledge to back campaign finance reform.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said that his action, which drew criticism from Democrats and some Republicans as overly aggressive, was not staged. ''It really wasn't,'' he said. His advisers have said he fully intended to take out the written pledge and wave it, but his approaching Mrs. Clinton, his aides have said, was impulsive.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lazio stepped up to her husband's defense. ''My feeling is that it would not even be an issue if it was a man on the other side of the podium,'' she said. She later added: ''I think that there are different perspectives when a woman is in the race. Rick has to be a little bit more cautious and careful. That may not be necessarily fair to him.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Lazio later said the congressman himself had never expressed such a view.</p>
