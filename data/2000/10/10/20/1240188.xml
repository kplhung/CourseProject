      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Some concert programs strike a lovely balance without seeming to try, and the double bill of duets presented last Friday night at the Stanley Kaplan Penthouse by Jazz at Lincoln Center did it right. The tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano and the pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba gave bravura performances together, in an almost actorly display of strength and craft; the guitarist Jim Hall and the bassist Scott Colley, by contrast, put on an understated and humorous set.</p>
        <p>In the right situation, Mr. Lovano can become something like the Laurence Olivier of jazz -- a serious practitioner with no fear, a high-wire buddha who has found his own rhythm, clearly ecstatic to be doing what he's doing and using the logic of bebop harmony and every bit of his own physicality to shape his delivery. He showed up with his saxophones as well as a full drum set and gongs; he became a percussionist on three pieces, in one of them while simultaneously playing a tenor saxophone.</p>

        <p>Some concert programs strike a lovely balance without seeming to try, and the double bill of duets presented last Friday night at the Stanley Kaplan Penthouse by Jazz at Lincoln Center did it right. The tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano and the pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba gave bravura performances together, in an almost actorly display of strength and craft; the guitarist Jim Hall and the bassist Scott Colley, by contrast, put on an understated and humorous set.</p>
        <p>In the right situation, Mr. Lovano can become something like the Laurence Olivier of jazz -- a serious practitioner with no fear, a high-wire buddha who has found his own rhythm, clearly ecstatic to be doing what he's doing and using the logic of bebop harmony and every bit of his own physicality to shape his delivery. He showed up with his saxophones as well as a full drum set and gongs; he became a percussionist on three pieces, in one of them while simultaneously playing a tenor saxophone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubalcaba, one of the greatest virtuosos of jazz piano at the moment, played in a digressive outpouring.</p>
        <p>The musicians propelled themselves forward on long lines. For Mr. Rubalcaba, Thelonious Monk's ''Ugly Beauty'' was a torrent; and for Mr. Lovano, Billy Strayhorn's ''Passion Flower'' was an opportunity to use everything he knew, from harmony to a Johnny Hodges-like emotive sighing that lies in an area beyond technique.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall also offered a set that brought up questions about the artist's relationship to his craft; there is probably no more self-effacing player at his level in jazz. He plays as if he could ditch it all tomorrow and never think about it again.</p>
        <p>Playing his sweet, oddball, sectional tunes against Mr. Colley's lithe accompaniment, he played either solo or strummed accompaniment. He did each with personality and deliberation, and was so little concerned about combining the two roles that he set his guitar at different volumes to accomplish each task.</p>
        <p>Even at their most unconventional, Mr. Hall's tunes sometimes run the risk of becoming dinky, like ''Frisell Frazzle'' and ''Uncle Ed,'' which used light blues and country phrases in original, circuitous song forms that were not their natural element.  But he is true to himself; he's not razzing popular music or pulling anybody's leg. As he began his solo with his thumb alone in Billie Holiday's ''Don't Explain,'' you had to pinch yourself to remember that this was a concert and not a suburban living room; his incredible reserve is one of the great artistic manipulations in jazz.</p>
