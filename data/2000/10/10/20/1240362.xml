        <p>Jose Canseco is back on the Yankees' roster. Even though he probably will be used only as a pinch-hitter, Canseco said yesterday that he is ready to help his team with his legs and glove, too.</p>
        <p>Canseco, 36, who was left off the roster for the American League Championship Series, also said that he wants to play in New York next year, but he wants to be thought of as more than a someone who can come off the bench to change the game with one swing.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I can help any organization in a part-time role,'' Canseco said. ''I don't see why I can't be an everyday player.''</p>
        <p>Yankees Manager Joe Torre is not looking much past next week. He has added Canseco to the Yankees' World Series roster because there may be three games at Shea Stadium, where the D.H. will not be used, and the Yankees may need a  right-handed pinch-hitter with power.</p>
        <p>Canseco batted only .243 in 37 games after the Yankees claimed him off waivers on Aug. 7 from Tampa Bay. He did not play in the division series against Oakland even though he was on the roster.</p>
        <p>Canseco played in three World Series with the Oakland Athletics, the last in 1990. He has 7 hits in 45 World Series at-bats.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, he is one of the few players who has an experience with a resemblance to the Subway Series. He was with Oakland in the all-Bay Area Series against San Francisco in 1989.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner Arrives</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner showed up at Yankee Stadium to lean against the batting cage and watch the Yankees' one-hour workout yesterday. The team's principal owner refused to make any predictions about the Series.</p>
        <p>''We'll show up,'' he said. ''We'll be there. I've been reading about how old we are, but we'll be there.''</p>
        <p>When asked if this Series was more special, because the Mets are the opponents, Steinbrenner said, ''It is exciting to be in a World Series, and it is for them, too, I imagine.''</p>
        <p>Later, in the Yankees' clubhouse, Steinbrenner suggested that the Series was probably more exciting for the Mets because they don't play in as many as the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner said: ''We have missed seven World Series in 38 years! They have been in only seven World Series in 38 years! You look it up!''</p>
        <p>His math was off a little. Since the Mets' first year in 1962, the Yankees have been in 11 World Series -- meaning they have missed 27 in that span -- while the Mets are playing in their fourth.</p>
