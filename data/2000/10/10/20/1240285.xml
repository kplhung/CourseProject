        <p>Paying the price for the record delays and flight cancellations of the summer, the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, reported a greater-than-expected loss yesterday for the third quarter, while Northwest Airlines exceeded Wall Street expectations.</p>
        <p>UAL said that rising fuel costs and a generous new contract settlement with its pilots led to a loss of $64 million, or $1.29 a share, compared with net income of $359 million, or $2.89 a share, in the corresponding period last year.</p>

        <p>Paying the price for the record delays and flight cancellations of the summer, the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, reported a greater-than-expected loss yesterday for the third quarter, while Northwest Airlines exceeded Wall Street expectations.</p>
        <p>UAL said that rising fuel costs and a generous new contract settlement with its pilots led to a loss of $64 million, or $1.29 a share, compared with net income of $359 million, or $2.89 a share, in the corresponding period last year.</p>
        <p>Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted a loss of 54 cents a share after UAL management warned last month that the company would lose money for the quarter.</p>
        <p>The loss appeared more drastic because, according to accounting standards, 65 million shares owned by United employees are excluded from the per-share calculation when UAL suffers a loss. Including that stock, the loss amounted to 57 cents a share, according to Raymond E. Neidl, an airline analyst with ING Baring in New York.</p>
        <p>United, which is the world's largest airline, was forced to cut its schedule by more than 2 percent over the summer after pilots and mechanics, angry about the slow pace of contract negotiations, disrupted operations. Nevertheless, revenue rose 1.2 percent, to $4.9 billion, during the quarter, compared with $4.85 billion a year earlier. That reflects the strong demand for air travel that has allowed carriers to raise fares five times this year.</p>
        <p>Douglas A. Hacker, UAL's chief financial officer, said the summer's disruption cost the company $450 million to $500 million in revenue. He added that its operations had improved markedly since it reached a tentative contract with its pilots on Aug. 26. Cancellations are down 60 percent and on-time departures have improved by 40 percent from the darkest days of the summer.</p>
        <p>But UAL said that its reduced schedule, combined with higher wage and fuel costs, would likely result in another loss for the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>''United's new labor cost structure is staggering,'' said Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst at PaineWebber in New York. ''It will materially impair the company's profitability.''</p>
        <p>United's troubles helped bolster earnings at Northwest, which picked up some United passengers where the two airlines' networks overlap in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>The third-quarter performance at Northwest, which is the country's fourth-largest carrier, was also a testament to the strong demand for airline seats. Northwest has one of the oldest, least fuel-efficient fleets in the airline industry. It also did less than many of its rivals to hedge against rising oil prices, which were 43 percent higher than they were in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Yet, it still managed to increase its earnings during the quarter.</p>
        <p>Northwest's profit from operations increased to $191 million, or $2.06 a share, from $180 million, or $1.96, in the year-earlier quarter. The results beat the $1.98 average estimate in a First Call/Thomson Financial survey of analysts.</p>
        <p>Rising fuel costs also hurt Trans World Airlines, which reported an operational loss of $45.2 million, or 62 cents a share, for the quarter, compared with a loss of $36.2 million, or 61 cents a share, in the period last year. Sales grew 11 percent, to $972.7 million, from $876.4 million in the third quarter of 1999.</p>
