        <p>The loneliness of following his pitchers from afar has surprised Mel Stottlemyre. But the Yankees pitching coach, recovering from treatment for bone-marrow cancer, expressed deep appreciation for the regular phone calls from Yankees Manager Joe Torre.</p>
        <p>''It was tough watching on a daily basis, wanting to be with the guys, watching on the day of the game,'' Stottlemyre said to reporters on a speaker phone yesterday from his New Jersey home. ''Joe Torre has probably been the most important person for me to get through this the way that I have, and even though I'm not there, he's contacted me daily and made me feel like I've been important to him and the ball club, and that I have been there in some respects for the ball club.''</p>

        <p>The loneliness of following his pitchers from afar has surprised Mel Stottlemyre. But the Yankees pitching coach, recovering from treatment for bone-marrow cancer, expressed deep appreciation for the regular phone calls from Yankees Manager Joe Torre.</p>
        <p>''It was tough watching on a daily basis, wanting to be with the guys, watching on the day of the game,'' Stottlemyre said to reporters on a speaker phone yesterday from his New Jersey home. ''Joe Torre has probably been the most important person for me to get through this the way that I have, and even though I'm not there, he's contacted me daily and made me feel like I've been important to him and the ball club, and that I have been there in some respects for the ball club.''</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre, who left the team in mid-September to receive treatment, said he feels terrific and asked about the possibility of rejoining the team in the postseason. But he says his doctor is reluctant to have him exposed to large groups of people; he is particularly susceptible to infection because of his treatment. But Stottlemyre was given the go-ahead to visit Yankee Stadium when there are few people around, and yesterday he stopped by Torre's office, leaving just as some pitchers were arriving. He chatted with Roger Clemens.</p>
        <p>The 58-year-old Stottlemyre indicated that he would be able to coach next year. ''My understanding is that if I continue to listen to them and do as they say,'' he said, referring to doctors, ''then I will be as good as new come spring. My primary concern is my health. I feel healthy enough to return.''</p>
