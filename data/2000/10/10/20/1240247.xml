        <p>Opium production in Afghanistan dropped 28 percent this year because of widespread drought and a United Nations crop-substitution program, the senior United Nations drug-control official said today.</p>
        <p>Afghanistan supplies an estimated 75 percent of the world's illicit opium, and the decline was one of the few bright spots at an international conference on drug trafficking and terrorism in Central Asia sponsored by the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p>
        <p>Despite the decline, regional and international leaders warned that illegal drug trafficking from Afghanistan and its rulers' links to insurgent movements pose the major threat to the tenuous political and economic stability of the five Central Asian nations: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. All were republics of the Soviet Union before that country dissolved at the end of 1991.</p>
        <p>''The threat is increasing and the major reason is the situation in Afghanistan,'' said Erlan Idrisov, the Kazakh foreign minister. ''It is the source of instability in the region.''</p>
        <p>An estimated 80 percent of Europe's heroin flows through the region. The drugs come across hundreds of miles of poorly policed borders and through remote mountain passes so high that drug-sniffing dogs are rendered useless by the altitude, then pass through Russia. The bulk of the shipments is heroin, concealed in cars, buses and trucks and carried by small groups of people on foot and horseback.</p>
        <p>This summer border guards in Kazakhstan, acting on a tip, stopped the car of the ambassador from Tajikistan. They slit open the tires and discovered a large amount of heroin in plastic bags. The ambassador was not implicated.</p>
        <p>Col. Zhanybek S. Bakiev, the chief of Kyrgyzstan's new international drug-control office, said last week that finding heroin is almost impossible unless the police have information in advance. He illustrated the difficulty by describing a recent incident in which border guards scouring a suspicious passenger bus found a large quantity of heroin concealed in the compressor for the air brakes.</p>
        <p>Thus, in a region where most trade travels by truck and roads built in the Soviet era lead deep into Russia, stopping drugs is a difficult task.</p>
        <p>The conference is intended to promote cooperation on border controls and regional security. Organizers said they want to develop a ''security belt'' around Afghanistan to curb the flow of drugs and the spread of insurgent violence, which many believe is financed by drug money.</p>
        <p>But speaker after speaker emphasized that the republics lack the financial resources to fight the flow of drugs on their own. They appealed for more aid to hire and train border guards and improve communications and detection equipment. And some chastised the United Nations and Western governments for promising assistance that never arrived.</p>
        <p>Tajikistan provided evidence that outside aid can make a difference. A new drug-control agency established with help from the United Nations seized 1.3 tons of heroin in the first nine months of this year, about the same amount seized in a year in the United States or Western Europe, according to United Nations officials. Most of the seizures occurred along the Afghan border.</p>
        <p>Heroin is refined opium, and Pino Arlacchi, executive director of the United Nations antidrug program, said opium production fell this year in Afghanistan to about 3,600 tons, after doubling last year, to 5,100 tons. While drought caused most of the decline, Mr. Arlacchi said a crop-substitution program accounted for about one-third of the drop.</p>
