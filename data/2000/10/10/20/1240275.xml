        <p>When her twin sons were born, Janice Lynch remembers holding them close and thinking, ''I have some cute little twins who are going to be movie stars when they grow up.'' Yesterday, the twins, 13-year-old seventh-graders still barely five feet tall, were arraigned on charges of raping and robbing a 40-year-old neighbor on Sunday in front of her terrified toddler.</p>
        <p>It is one of those crimes that horrifies the public, leaving a trail of questions about what kind of boys, from what kind of family, would commit such a vicious act so young.</p>
        <p>Answers are not excuses, but what emerges from interviews with the twins' relatives and teachers and from child welfare experts is a picture of a damaging childhood wrenched further by a two-year odyssey through the city's foster care system.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the debate over foster care has been framed as a conflict between child protection and family preservation. But many child welfare experts consider that choice a false dichotomy, and whatever the outcome of the twins' criminal case, the chaotic troubles of their short lives illustrate why.</p>
        <p>When the twins entered foster care at 10, they were possibly already the walking wounded of earlier family traumas. They were the youngest of five children abandoned by a crack-addicted father, their earliest school years spent moving from one homeless shelter to another. They were 6 when a fire destroyed all the family's possessions. By 7, the first-born twin had been attacked by a pit bull outside one shelter and hit by a car near another; he was declared learning-disabled when he was 8.</p>
        <p>Yet the foster care system itself may have inflicted new psychic injuries. The boys were shuttled through five placements in two years, including foster homes where they complained of beatings -- unfounded complaints, according to the city -- and a psychiatric center where an assessment stretched into weeks away from any family members and ended with the boys split up for more than a year. Psychologists say the sense of abandonment experienced by such children typically makes them feel angry and unloved.</p>
        <p>In March 1998, after six months in the foster care system, the twins, then 11, were accused, along with a 7-year-old, of sexually molesting a 5-year-old relative in a foster home.</p>
        <p>The city's child welfare agency determined that there was insufficient evidence to support the charge, but Marty Beyer, a Washington, D.C., clinical psychologist who consults with child welfare and juvenile justice systems about such cases, said it raises questions about whether the twins themselves had been sexually abused in foster care or earlier.</p>
        <p>Their mother, who veers from combative denial of their guilt in the latest case to tearful depression, said that by the time the Family Court discharged them to their ailing grandmother a year ago, the boys felt lost.</p>
        <p>Foster care ''affected them bad because they didn't know what was going on,'' Ms. Lynch said in one of several interviews this week. ''They didn't trust anyone anymore,'' she added.</p>
        <p>City officials say Ms. Lynch's own failings as a parent, including alleged substance abuse and inadequate supervision, required the removal of the boys and their three older sisters in October 1997. Ms. Lynch, whose teenage daughters were returned to her a year ago after she passed a drug test, denies ever abusing drugs or being neglectful. She describes herself as a mother who struggled with too little help to do the best she could for her children, all born of a stormy relationship with her ninth-grade sweetheart.</p>
        <p>''Their father turned his back on me after the twins were born,'' she wrote in a school composition book after the twins' arrest, in an essay she titled ''Why Me, the Janice Lynch Story.'' ''When I saw my kids' father on crack, it went all down heels. He started stealing my kids' clothes and food, and I called the police often.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lynch, who was 17 and in 10th grade when her first baby's birth led her to drop out, wistfully lists a series of short-lived jobs going back to the 1980's: in a typewriter ribbon factory in Queens; as a waitress at Roy Rogers in Pennsylvania Station; at a doughnut shop; most recently in the mail room of Dean Witter. Mainly, she said, she made ends meet through public assistance, food stamps and help from her mother, who provides licensed foster care in a neatly kept apartment in the Mount Hope section of the Bronx.</p>
        <p>For a decade Ms. Lynch managed to stay in one apartment nearby, but she said she and the children had to turn to the shelter system in 1993 when water damage made the apartment uninhabitable and then it was destroyed by fire.</p>
        <p>''I really had to start over from the bottom, with all my kids,'' she wrote in her notebook, recalling a confused procession of shelters and apartments in all five boroughs.</p>
        <p>In Brooklyn, she said, the first twin had to have stitches in his neck after being mauled by the dog. Later, he was hospitalized with a broken foot after the car ran him down. The incident so traumatized his brother, she added, that he would not leave his twin's bedside for three days.</p>
        <p>But life seemed to take a turn for the better four years ago when the family got a three-bedroom apartment on De Kalb Avenue in the north  Bronx under the federal rent-subsidy program known as Section 8. Ms. Lynch remembers every detail of the twins' room, painted blue with gold trim, with twin beds, a lamp for reading, a TV, and pictures of Donald Duck and Michael Jordan that she gave them for Christmas in 1996.</p>
        <p>That was their last Christmas together. In the spring of 1997, a caseworker from the Administration for Children's Services became involved with the family while taking the three children of one of Ms. Lynch's sisters into foster care. The caseworker suspected that Ms. Lynch herself was a crack user and that she was neglecting the children, Ms. Lynch said in an account corroborated by agency records.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Lynch tells it, she belligerently denied the accusation, rejected the agency's inquiries and ignored its letters and telephone calls.</p>
        <p>Caseworkers, armed with records of repeated truancies and a report that the twins had been locked out one night while their mother was at a party, took them all into custody. The three girls were eventually sent to an aunt's house; the boys went to the first of several foster homes.</p>
        <p>''They cried every time I saw them,'' Ms. Lynch said. ''They wanted to go home with me.''</p>
        <p>But Within two weeks, cut from rental assistance and cash aid when the children were removed, Ms. Lynch had lost the family apartment and most of its belongings. The twins were briefly placed with their grandmother, but when she allowed Ms. Lynch to stay there, too, caseworkers removed the children again.</p>
        <p>''No kids, no home, no welfare, no job,'' she wrote in her notebook. ''No one wants to care for Janice Lynch.''</p>
        <p>It took her two years to win the girls back, who now live with her in a one-bedroom subsidized apartment with torn linoleum and broken faucets not far from Yankee Stadium. The oldest daughter, 17, is a student at City College; the second, 15, is five months' pregnant.</p>
        <p>Outside Intermediate School 306 on Tremont Avenue, where the twins were in special education classes this fall, teachers and other staff members described them as troubled and troublemaking -- but no more than many of their peers.</p>
        <p>In court yesterday, the twins denied the charges against them, including rape in the first degree, attempted sodomy, burglary and multiple counts of assault. Looking dazed, they sat on either side of their parents. Their father, Keith Cane, who relatives say is now drug-free, insisted that the boys' lawyers argue for their release.</p>
        <p>The court refused.</p>
        <p>''The allegations shock the consciousness of the community,'' Judge Marian Shelton said. She ordered the twins returned to a secure detention center, citing ''the combined interest of protecting the victim, the community and the serious risk of the juveniles committing another act.''</p>
        <p>Their mother kissed them before they were led away.</p>
