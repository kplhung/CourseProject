        <p>BERGER-Ruth M. Of South Salem, NY, died peacefully at home on October 18, surrounded by her loved ones. She was, and always will be, the beloved and adored wife of Alan and adored and cherished mother of Danielle. Our hearts ache with the suddenness and shock of losing you. You brought from your beloved Switzerland a zest for life and you filled our days with love and joy. We will always hear your song, see your face, and cherish the love we shared. And in all that we do we will always be guided by your loving and generous spirit.</p>
