        <p>2 Die in West Bank Clash, Straining New Cease-Fire  An army-escorted hike by three dozen Jewish settlers in the West Bank touched off a protracted firefight that weakened expectations that the two-day-old cease-fire agreement would take hold. The seven-hour clash left two dead, one Israeli and one Palestinian. They were the first deaths since Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed in Egypt this week to halt the violence.</p>

        <p>Blast Inquiry in Yemen  The investigation into the attack on the destroyer Cole has led to a mountainous tribal region on Yemen's eastern border with Saudi Arabia that became a stronghold of Islamic terror groups returning from fighting Soviet forces in Afghanistan.</p>
