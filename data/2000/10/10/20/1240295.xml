        <p>Joe Torre's team meetings are secret, held with the thick blue clubhouse doors closed, a jacketed sentry posted outside. But deciphering his private message can sometimes be simple: just listen to his players afterward. They often echo his words, like a campaign mantra.</p>
        <p>The World Series is not about Mike Piazza against Roger Clemens or the Yankees-Mets rivalry, several of them, including Clemens, said after Torre's meeting yesterday. The World Series is bigger than that, and the Yankees seem determined to stay on message.</p>
        <p>''We'll show up, I can tell you that for sure,'' said George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, who marched through the clubhouse repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Torre conducted business as usual, his players working out on the sunny fall afternoon, and he revealed the Yankees' pitching rotation for the first three games -- the left-hander Andy Pettitte will start Game 1 tomorrow, Clemens will start Game 2 and Orlando Hernandez Game 3. Torre would not announce his Game 4 starter, but all signs pointed to David Cone, the veteran right-hander, who would make his first appearance at Shea Stadium since the Mets traded him in 1992.</p>
        <p>By starting Game 2, Clemens will fall in line to pitch Game 6, meaning that he will probably not pitch or bat at Shea in this series, which should defuse at least some of the lingering rancor over Clemens's July 8 beaning of Piazza.</p>
        <p>''I don't see any reason why I should revisit that,'' Clemens said, ''other than to say, I'm glad to see that Mike is O.K. and he could keep playing. Again, I was as upset as anybody, I reacted that way on the mound, even in the heat of battle.</p>
        <p>''This is about the World Series, not about us. He's going to battle me when he steps in there, and I'm going to battle him and try to get him out, and I wouldn't expect anything different.''</p>
        <p>Clemens knows he will be under great scrutiny when he pitches against Piazza, but that ''won't deter how I try and pitch,'' he said. ''I'll still pitch inside. That's part of my game. I've got to go in there. He's a dangerous hitter. Depending on who their hottest hitter is, we might have to pitch around him. It's not going to deter how I work or how aggressive I am.''</p>
        <p>Clemens said he would have no problem batting at Shea -- ''I'll do what I need to do,'' he said -- and Torre mentioned that he would not have hesitated to use Clemens in Shea. But Torre was visibly annoyed that the Piazza beaning is looming over this Subway Series, and he strongly chastised the news media for revisiting the incident.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a disservice to people what's going on,'' Torre said. ''Whether you pick up a newspaper or you watch a network, that's all you see is Mike getting hit in the head. I would like to believe this World Series is more about competition and fun than it will be about getting even and inciting riots.''</p>
        <p>Torre would not commit to his Game 4 starter, saying he would like to see how the first couple of games play out. But Torre has spoken with Cone extensively about the right-hander's readiness to start, and the fact that the manager, the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre and Cone spoke so openly yesterday about the possibility of a Game 4 start are strong clues.</p>
        <p>The 37-year-old Cone was 4-14 with a 6.91 earned run average during his miserable regular season, dislocating his left, nonthrowing shoulder in the last month; he believes that if he even had a mediocre year, the team would have won far more than the 87 victories it compiled in the regular season. Cone, essentially the last man on the Yankees' pitching staff in the first two rounds of the playoffs, pitched only one inning, against Seattle in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>But Cone looked good in that one inning and the starter Denny Neagle pitched poorly, constantly working behind in the ball-strike count, something that Torre detests. Knowing Cone's history in the World Series -- he is 2-0 with a 2.15 E.R.A. in five starts -- and how he might respond, Torre acknowledged he was giving serious consideration to using Cone.</p>
        <p>It is probably further along than that. Stottlemyre, speaking with reporters on a speaker phone, said he would agree with whatever Torre decided. But he added: ''If anything is going to lift David Cone back to pitching at the level he's pitched before, I think the Shea Stadium atmosphere, the fact that it's against the Mets, all those things would all be pluses, and I think he would react very favorably.</p>
        <p>''I think inside David Cone it would be a tremendous lift for him. It would also be a tremendous lift for the ballclub.''</p>
        <p>Cone has been hoping for a chance like this, for a shot at some redemption. He has not started a game since losing to Baltimore on Sept. 30, but he has always responded well to extensive rest; he threw his perfect game last year after 11 days off. ''I can lay it on the line,'' he said yesterday. ''It's a long off-season to recover. There's nothing to save.</p>
        <p>''It would mean everything to me.''</p>
        <p>Neagle came to the Yankees in a midseason trade with Cincinnati, slumped at year's end, and he feels he has not been around to earn the type of trust that Torre has in Cone. ''It could be Coney's last hurrah in uniform,'' Neagle said. ''I totally understand. Hey, but he's also a great postseason pitcher, and it's not like you'd just be throwing him out there.''</p>
        <p>Torre already had plans to switch Chuck Knoblauch from designated hitter to second base for the games in Shea Stadium, but he said yesterday that he was thinking about starting Knoblauch at second in either Game 1 or Game 2 at Yankee Stadium, a move that would enable him to insert a slugger like Glenallen Hill or Jose Canseco into the lineup as the designated hitter. Knoblauch has not played in the field since Sept. 29 because of defensive problems rooted in his throwing jitters.</p>
