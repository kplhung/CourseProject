        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Oct. 14 news article about Erasmus Hall High School football and Sid Luckman brought back many pleasant memories. Sid and I were classmates in the class of 1935 during its glory days. One of the courses we suffered through together was Latin, which focused on Julius Caesar's ''Gallic Wars.''</p>

        <p>Your Oct. 14 news article about Erasmus Hall High School football and Sid Luckman brought back many pleasant memories. Sid and I were classmates in the class of 1935 during its glory days. One of the courses we suffered through together was Latin, which focused on Julius Caesar's ''Gallic Wars.''</p>
        <p>Since Sid, even in his sophomore year, was already an established football star at Erasmus, we asked him why he was taking such a difficult course.</p>
        <p>His answer was, ''It's good for developing the mind.'' In view of the fact that he was such a clever field general at Columbia, and later with the Chicago Bears, he must have been correct. I wonder how good a football general Julius Caesar would have been.</p>
