        <p>'Most Valuable Primate'  Directed by Robert Vince  PG; 93 minutes</p>
        <p>''MVP: Most Valuable Primate'' may bear the outline of a cookie cutter, but at least the cutter wasn't wielded by a klutz.</p>
        <p>Out of the same factory that gave the world animals as athletes in ''Air Bud'' and ''Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver'' in 1997 and 1998, ''MVP'' recycles the formula to substitute a chimpanzee for the dogs and ice hockey for basketball and football.</p>
        <p>With its plot about a team of losers transformed into champions by the arrival of a talented player from out of town and a mysterious skating chimp with fancy moves and a Hull of a shot, ''MVP'' breaks no new ice in storytelling.</p>
        <p>But for juvenile filmgoers and families in search of a more-than-twice-told tale with uplifting messages about the rewards of perseverance, the virtues of animals and acceptance of the handicapped, ''MVP'' will do.</p>
        <p>Written, directed and produced by Robert Vince for Keystone Family Pictures, brewers of the ''Bud'' films, the new chimp-on-ice comedy has the good grace not to overdo the animal antics, not to make the inept Nelson Nuggets any more clownish than necessary, not to turn its teenage hero and heroine into caricatures and not to transform their parents into buffoons.</p>
        <p>Nor does ''MVP'' lay an unduly heavy hand on its plot points about the mentally impaired university janitor who is the chimp's best friend and the hearing-impaired girl who takes in the chimp when a  plan to save the animal from being sold by a greedy dean to a disease lab inadvertently lands the animal not in his family's habitat, an animal preserve in California, but in a snowy little town in British Columbia.</p>
        <p>So while Jack, the precocious, communicative chimp, is making himself a new home in a convenient treehouse, the teenage Steven Westover (Kevin Zegers of the ''Bud'' films) and his kid sister, Tara (Jamie Renee Smith), are trying to fit into life in Nelson, where their parents have just moved from California.</p>
        <p>But Steven, a hockey star in California hoping to advance in the sport, finds the dispirited Nuggets uninterested in much besides brawling as they lose game after game. And Tara, because of her lack of hearing, finds herself an outcast among her new classmates.</p>
        <p>The discovery of Jack changes all. Jack, whose previous life in a university research environment has revealed him to be an able scholar, picks up skating and hockey in a flash. When he intrudes on a Nuggets game, the team, the league and the town are galvanized. And Tara's new pal helps her make new friends in school.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, though, the villainous university dean is determined to recover Jack, and it is only a matter of time before all paths cross in Vancouver, just as the rags-to-respectability Nuggets are playing for a championship in a National Hockey League arena.</p>
        <p>Will the evil dean triumph? Will Jack wind up in a hepatitis lab? Will the dreams of Steven and the Nuggets turn out to be fool's gold?</p>
        <p>Never fear. Movies like ''MVP'' are intended not to disturb but to comfort.</p>
        <p>Like cookies.</p>
        <p>''MVP: Most Valuable Primate'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes hockey violence and a bit of bathroom humor.</p>
