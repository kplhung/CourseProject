        <p>It was lunch time at the Ridgewood Diner.</p>
        <p>An old man from Belize nibbled at a sandwich at a table near the door. An older woman sipped orange juice from a cardboard cup at a booth in the back. The Egyptian counterman leaned on his elbows in front of a row of empty stools. He was dressed in grease-stained kitchen whites. He was staring at his hands.</p>
        <p>''Hey,'' the old woman, Ann McMahon, called out to him when the silence became too much. ''So who you rooting for, anyway? The Yankees or the Mets?''</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' the counterman, Mohammed Hosnay, confessed. ''Baseball? I don't even understand that game.''</p>
        <p>That's when the other customer, Nelson Leslie, spoke up.</p>
        <p>''Well, the Yankees are New York's team and the Mets are the underdogs,'' he offered, trying to help. ''A win for either would be good for New York.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McMahon just squawked like a goose. ''Who you kidding?'' she wanted to know. ''Forget the Yankees. Root for the Mets. They try so hard but always get nowhere fast.''</p>
        <p>The city was thrust into civil war on Tuesday night when the Yankees beat the Mariners to join the Mets in an all-New York World Series, an October marvel that has not been seen since 1956. The players posed, the politicians postured and the pundits prognosticated around the clock. But the real story of the Subway Series will be how the games awaken the neighborhoods, illuminating differences or bridging divides, as the Battle of New York plays out.</p>
        <p>This year, the fans are as numerous as they are diverse. They are not only 90-year-old women and immigrants from Belize. They are nuns and crossing guards, truck drivers, pizzeria owners, cabbies, drinkers, teetotalers, aldermen and bums. Across the city, they are abuzz with baseball chatter, talking in barber shops and schoolyards, in coffee shops and living rooms, on street corners and in local bars.</p>
        <p>The Ridgewood Diner, a dumpy little joint beneath the shadow of the elevated M train, is just one place among many inflamed with baseball fever. It sits on the border of Ridgewood, which straddles Queens and Brooklyn, and Bushwick, in Brooklyn. They are two ethnically different neighborhoods hanging beside each other in the middle of the city like a bedsheet draped across the clothesline of Myrtle Avenue.</p>
        <p>The two neighborhoods form as good a laboratory as any in which to observe the World Series games as they brush up against regular New Yorkers and their daily lives. They are nearly split between Yankee fans and Met fans. They both contain the well-to-do, the middle-class, the poor and the really poor. They are home to blacks, Hispanics, Italians, Irish, Romanians and Poles.</p>
        <p>The regular folks of Bushwick and Ridgewood are clearly caught up in the Subway Series games. At the 83rd Precinct, the scratchboard in the conference room is covered with trash-talking taunts that hack at both teams. At St. Barbara's Church, parishioners bicker over the Mets and the Yankees even during Mass.</p>
        <p>At the same time, there are parts of both neighborhoods content to let the series just slide by. The Italian immigrants of the European Coffee House on Fresh Pond Road think the big game means the soccer match between the Milan and Juventus teams. The Mormon missionaries who roam Myrtle Avenue looking to increase their flock are oblivious to the baseball craze.</p>
        <p>Like many places in New York, Ridgewood and Bushwick have long been landing points for the city's immigrants. For some of them, baseball has made that landing easier to bear.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leslie, for example, first learned about baseball from the American merchant marines he met while working as a shipwright on the docks of his native Belize. When he moved to Brooklyn more than 20 years ago, he played on a sandlot baseball team. The game, he said, helped make him an American.</p>
        <p>''Baseball was very popular in Belize so I already had something that would make me fit in,'' Mr. Leslie, 60, said on Wednesday afternoon. ''I knew the rules and I could talk to people about Billy Martin. I love Billy Martin. He made me feel like I belonged here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hosnay was not as lucky. He was raised in Egypt on a diet of soccer and political strife. Just the other day, two women sat at his counter and asked him how the baseball game had gone the night before. He had to tell them he was sorry, that he did not know.</p>
        <p>''I wish there was a place I could go to learn about baseball, like a school or something,'' he went on. ''A place where they would tell you, 'Baseball began here and these are the rules.' '' He feels somewhat embarrassed by his ignorance. ''I have nowhere to learn and so I do not pay attention to the games at all,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>But the Ridgewood Diner was, in fact, the school that he was looking for. From Ms. McMahon, there was a lesson on the passions and the history of New York baseball. From Mr. Leslie, a study on how to become a citizen through the sport. Mr. Hosnay's own contribution to the class, as small as it might be, was a willingness to learn from those who went before him.</p>
        <p>''So, Mohammed,'' said Ms. McMahon. ''You're not a baseball fan at all?''</p>
        <p>''No,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I didn't think so. It just takes time.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McMahon should know. She has lived in Ridgewood since 1930. She has eaten at the diner nearly every day since 1970. Her baseball memory is long. It reaches back well before Don Larsen's perfect game in the last Subway Series, 44 years ago.</p>
        <p>''In New York, you got to know baseball and you got to pick your team,'' Ms. McMahon said. ''I just got caught up with the Mets. What can I say? I feel sorry for them.'' Despite her loyalties, Ms. McMahon admitted that the Subway Series will be good for New York no matter who prevails. Mr. Hosnay took her word for it. Mr. Leslie also agreed.</p>
        <p>''Baseball is an artistic game, a beautiful game,'' Mr. Leslie said as he polished off his lunch. ''But more than anything else, it is a game of teamwork. When people play together, there may be a loser, but everybody wins.''</p>
        <p>BASEBALL: SUBWAY SERIES -- ACROSS THE DIVIDE  Correction:  October 21, 2000, Saturday  A chart yesterday listing statistics about subway lines serving Shea and Yankee stadiums misstated the figures for the average miles between mechanical failures for trains on the No. 7 and No. 4 lines for the last six months of 1999, as calculated by the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group. No. 7 trains traveled 125,682 miles (not 125,612), and No. 4 trains traveled 163,227 miles (not 63,227).</p>
