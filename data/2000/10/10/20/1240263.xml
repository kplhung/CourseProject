        <p>Brushing aside objections from President Clinton, Republican leaders of Congress announced today that they had agreed on a plan to pump $28 billion into Medicare over the next five years, mainly by increasing payments to health maintenance organizations, hospitals and other providers that care for the elderly.</p>
        <p>With that plan, the Republicans appear to have set themselves up for a high-stakes political confrontation with the White House just three weeks before Election Day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has repeatedly complained that the Republican bill, details of which have emerged piecemeal over the last week, would give too much money to H.M.O.'s., which he says are already overpaid.</p>
        <p>Republicans, on the other hand, say it is imperative to increase payments to health maintenance organizations to keep them from dropping out of selected Medicare markets.</p>
        <p>Representative Jim McCrery, Republican of Louisiana, said lawmakers had heard from hundreds of constituents who were saying in effect, ''I've lost my Medicare H.M.O., and I want it back.''</p>
        <p>The president has threatened to veto the legislation, and Republicans today virtually challenged him to carry out that threat.</p>
        <p>Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said he could not believe that Mr. Clinton would veto the bill, since it provides $5.7 billion in new preventive-care coverage and other assistance to beneficiaries over the next five years.</p>
        <p>Medicare spent roughly $214 billion in the fiscal year that ended on  Sept. 30. Congress sharply reduced the growth of Medicare when it trimmed payments to health care providers in 1997. Now, under pressure from providers of all types, it is acting to restore some of the money. Democrats endorse that goal but disagree with Republicans on how the money should be divided up.</p>
        <p>The new bill, as described by Republican lawmakers and their aides,  has these provisions:</p>
        <p>*H.M.O.'s would receive $10.2 billion more from Medicare over five years than under current law -- $6.2 billion in basic Medicare payments, plus $4 billion to reflect the cost of new benefits and the higher rates for doctors, hospitals and nursing homes.</p>
        <p>*Hospitals would receive $8.4 billion of additional Medicare money in the next five years. This includes a full adjustment in 2001 to cover inflation in the cost of goods and services used by hospitals.</p>
        <p>*Nursing homes would receive $1.6 billion of additional Medicare payments. The bill would enable  nursing homes to pay higher wages to nurses and nursing assistants but would not require them to use the money for that purpose.</p>
        <p>*Home health care agencies would receive $1.3 billion in additional payments over the next five years. This would provide a 12-month delay in a 15 percent cut that is scheduled to take effect next October.</p>
        <p>Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, said the Republicans had not discussed the bill's details with him or other administration officials. The veto threat is ''still operative,'' said Mr. Jennings, who pleaded with Republicans to consult the White House before sending their bill to the floor of the House and the Senate for votes next week.</p>
        <p>''The absence of bipartisanship,'' he said, ''significantly reduces the viability of any health care initiative.''</p>
