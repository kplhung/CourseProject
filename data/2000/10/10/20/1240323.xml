        <p>The inquiry into the attack on the destroyer Cole has led investigators to a mountainous region on the eastern border with Saudi Arabia that has been a stronghold of Islamic groups returning from the war against Soviet forces in Afghanistan, American and Yemeni officials said today.</p>
        <p>As the investigation gathered pace today, the Navy announced it had recovered the bodies of the last four sailors listed as missing after the suicide bombing attack, which occurred last Thursday and killed 17 sailors and wounded 39 others.</p>
        <p>Divers with metal-cutters found the bodies deep inside the ship, an area so devastated that Louis J. Freeh, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, described the scene after a visit as ''absolutely catastrophic damage.''</p>
        <p>Yemeni officials also said they had searched a house near the harbor that they have tentatively identified as the place where the bomb was assembled.</p>
        <p>The search yielded at least one document that originated in Hadhramaut, a region about 500 miles northeast of Aden along the border with Saudi Arabia. The area is the ancestral home of the family of Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi financier who is the F.B.I.'s most-wanted terrorist suspect because, the bureau says, he directed the bombing of the American embassies in East Africa in 1998.</p>
        <p>Although the document, a driver's license, was made out to a false name, the Yemeni officials said, they had begun intensive inquiries in the region. But they did not say the evidence had led them to conclude that Mr. bin Laden, who is in hiding in Afghanistan, is a suspect.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh and other American officials said it was still too early to speculate about who might have ordered or carried out the attack, or on possible motives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh's one-day visit here, to consult with investigators and with President Ali Abdullah Saleh, reflected the importance attached by Washington to leads developed by the Yemenis.</p>
        <p>Yemeni officials have said a 12-year-old boy provided a crucial lead when he told the police that he had been approached by a bearded Arab man with glasses who approached him as he played beside the bay last Thursday morning, about the time the Cole entered the harbor. The boy's account, the Yemenis said, was that the stranger gave him a few coins to watch a car and boat trailer. Then the man unloaded the boat, launched it and disappeared, the boy said.</p>
        <p>Yemeni officials said the car was registered to a woman from Somalia, across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen.</p>
        <p>At a news conference, Mr. Freeh praised the ''fine investigative work'' by the Yemenis in identifying two safe houses a few miles across the bay from where the Cole was attacked, as well as the car, the trailer and the documents linking two men who lived at one house to Hadhramaut. The Yemenis displayed ''very, very good police work,'' he added.</p>
        <p>President Saleh said in a television interview Wednesday that one of the houses had been used to prepare what he and Mr. Freeh, separately, described as ''the explosive device.''</p>
        <p>American officials said the phrase would cover a large bomb of about a third of a ton of TNT, the kind American investigators originally believed to have been used in the attack, as well as something more sophisticated, like a ''shaped charge'' -- a torpedo or a missile.</p>
        <p>In the week since the attack, more detailed accounts have described much greater damage to the destroyer than earlier Navy reports suggested. Mr. Freeh appeared shocked by the damage he saw when a Navy launch took him up to the gaping hole on the Cole, which Navy officials describe as being wide enough for two city buses to pass through abreast. Witnesses -- Yemenis on the waterfront and sailors abroad the Cole -- have said a small boat moving among other craft servicing the Cole rammed the ship's port side and exploded in a ball of flame.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh said photographs did not adequately convey the destruction. The decks separating mess halls and engineering spaces, where most of the sailors died, collapsed in the blast, leaving ''a tangled mess of metal and wire,'' he said.</p>
        <p>President Saleh gave a similar account. The Yemeni leader, a former army general, said his initial insistence that the explosion must have resulted from an accident aboard the Cole was based on having gone out to look closely at the Cole and wondering ''how a small boat that is about the size of a desk could possibly cause this much damage.''</p>
        <p>The president said he had been told by ''American technicians'' that the damage from the explosion had reached within seven feet of the ship's arsenal, where cruise missiles were stored.</p>
