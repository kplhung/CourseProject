        <p>Parents beware: Your kids have strategies, part stealth and part seduction, to defy regular bedtimes for the duration of the Subway Series.</p>
        <p>Daniel Vithlani, a 9-year-old from Manhattan, intends to sneak into the living room after his mother is asleep, hit the mute button on the television and watch his beloved Yankees to his heart's content.</p>
        <p>Daniel's usual 9:30 lights out on school nights, and 10 o'clock on weekends, is likely to be forgiven, the boy predicted yesterday, because even his mother, a baseball know-nothing, understands that history is being made here.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I'll get in trouble,'' he said confidently, to the high-fives of friends at an after-school program at the 92nd Street Y. ''She knows it matters a lot.''</p>
        <p>Daniel's heady anticipation was echoed in interviews with dozens of children, aged 7 to 14, throughout the region yesterday. Whether they were rooting for the Mets or the Yankees, whether they knew the year and the combatants in the last Subway Series and whether they expected to do their homework or not next week, the youngsters were of one mind about certain things.</p>
        <p>They reported that the heckling already has started between siblings and friends who root for different teams, but was gentler in tone than the arguments they have overheard among adults. They said that their schools had quickly jumped on the baseball bandwagon, with activities like jersey and cap days, contests to pick the winner and the number of games and dueling chants in the lunchroom.</p>
        <p>And they told of desperate attempts to get tickets, whether by entering sweepstakes on their favorite radio stations or cozying up to friends whose parents were well connected.</p>
        <p>When it comes to shouting matches between Yankee and Met fans, ''the grownups are the worst,'' said Eric Wilson, 13, who attends Intermediate School 123 in the Bronx and hosts a hip-hop radio program at the Point, a community center in Hunts Point. Among his friends, Eric said, the back-and-forth is sharp but harmless. ''Everybody's cool with it,'' he said. ''I don't think no fights are going to break out.''</p>
        <p>But his grandmother, with whom he lives, has no such faith in the adults, who may tumble out of local bars with fists flying. She has told Eric that he must be in the house earlier than usual, and he has not objected. ''Kids think better than adults,'' he said. ''It's just a sport. It's not a big old the-world's-coming-to-an-end kind of thing.''</p>
        <p>David Rivera, 11, who was playing soccer outside at nearby St. Ignatius middle school, agreed that adults let sports rivalries get the better of them. David's father roots for the Yankees, he said, and his uncle for the Mets. ''They love each other,'' he said. ''But when it comes to baseball, they don't talk.''</p>
        <p>At St. Ignatius, a contest was launched yesterday to pick the series winner, the number of games and the score of the deciding contest. Most of the ballots were for the Bronx Bombers. ''There are a maximum of maybe five or 10 people in our school who like the Mets,'' said Danny Santana, 12. ''And all of them are teachers.''</p>
        <p>Danny's mother, however, is among the few Mets' faithful in the borough, even though, he said, ''she's not from Queens or anything so she has no excuse.'' But his mother was the one who ''stood on the phone for four hours pressing redial'' so that he and his father could see a Yankees-Mariners game during the American League championships.</p>
        <p>Danny did not get to bed until 1 a.m. that day, and he impressed his parents by waking up on time for school, with his homework completed. This will be his main arguing point when he ''tries to negotiate'' a late bedtime next week. ''This is like every 100,000 years or something,'' he said. ''I really want to see these games.''</p>
        <p>The issue of bedtimes loomed larger than any other yesterday with a broad consensus that where there's a will there's a way.</p>
        <p>At the HMV music store on Lexington Avenue and 86th Street, half a dozen middle school students were counting on the fact that most had their own television sets.</p>
        <p>''They don't approve,'' Cassie Nadaner, 13, said of her parents' attitude toward late-night ballgames. ''But they don't tell me I can't. And anyway the TV is in my room.''</p>
        <p>At H.C. Crittenden Middle School in Armonk, a suburb in Westchester County, Christine Wiegand, 11, said she had mastered her technique during the playoffs. ''I go up to my room like I'm going to sleep,'' she said. ''But when my mom is downstairs doing chores, I sneak into my parents' room and watch TV. When I hear someone coming up, I turn it off.''</p>
        <p>In Ossining, on the other side of Westchester, Thomas O'Connor, 13, already has permission to stay up, provided his homework and chores are done. ''It's living history,'' explained his mother, Henriette O'Connor.</p>
        <p>But Thomas' cousin, a second grader, is not so fortunate. Mrs. O'Connor said of her sister's family that ''after a lot of negotiation, they came up with a deal that he watches until 9:30 and then they tape the rest'' for viewing over breakfast.</p>
        <p>Tape delay was also the plan proposed by Ned Gerson's mother, a nonfan. Ned, a 9-year-old, shares a passion for baseball with his father and both agree that ''it's no good if it's not real.''</p>
        <p>Ned said he expected his mother's plan would be scratched once she was properly educated on its import. ''When we tell her it's the Subway Series, that might change it,'' he said.</p>
