        <p>+ ''GORE VIDAL'S 'THE BEST MAN.' ''  Whatever the weaknesses of this unsteady revival, it makes you wish Mr. Vidal were writing the dialogue for the presidential debates. Despite the notoriously short shelf life of satire in the theater, this 1960 morality tale of a national political convention still rings with the whip cracks of abiding worldly wisdom dispensed in quips. At its best the play brings to the back-stabbing world of campaigning some of the fiery verbal artifice that the movies ''All About Eve'' and ''The Sweet Smell of Success'' brought to the back-stabbing worlds of show business and journalism. Unfortunately, what those movies have that this production does not is a rousing, melodramatic vigor. Led by Charles Durning, Spalding Gray and Christopher Noth, directed by Ethan McSweeney, the starry ensemble often feels frustratingly tentative (2:20). Virginia, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 to $75 (Ben Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''PROOF.'' An exhilarating and assured new play by David Auburn that turns the esoteric world of higher mathematics literally into a back-porch drama, as accessible and compelling as a detective story. A mystery about the authorship of a particularly important proof, it is also about twin enigmas: genius and love. Without any baffling erudition, the play presents mathematicians as both blessed and bedeviled by the gift for abstraction that ties them achingly to one another and separates them, also achingly, from concreteminded folks like you and me. Perhaps most satisfying of all, it does so without a moment of meanness. Performed by an exemplary cast, most notably Mary-Louis Parker, the play reaches into the most competitive and difficult intellectual terrain and finds - guess what? - good people (2:00). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets, $24 to $69 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>* ''THE TALE OF THE ALLERGIST'S WIFE.'' The hard-working demons who possessed little Linda Blair in ''The Exorcist'' have nothing on the forces raging within one Marjorie Taub, the title character of Charles Busch's window-rattling comedy of midlife malaise on the Upper West Side. Marjorie, avid culture consumer and avid self-flagellator, is played to spectacular effect by Linda Lavin, who turns feeling blue into a study in Technicolor. She is the volcanic center of a nimble sitcom of a play that pushes at the edges of its form without ripping through them. Mr. Busch, best known as the leading lady of his own camp fests, has swum into the mainstream. And with the help of Lynne Meadow's graceful, low-key direction and an assured cast that features Tony Roberts and Michele Lee, he stays comfortably afloat. The evening doesn't quite know how to resolve itself, but with the fierce Ms. Lavin in charge, it earns its wall-to-wall laughs (2:15). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets, $30 and $70 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>''THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST.'' Playing a less-than-merry widow in this somber screwball comedy by Tom Donaghy, Mary Steenburgen has that grown-up waif look that makes sane people run for cover. She's Little Orphan Annie with cleavage, a manicure and an agressive air of neediness, bringing new resonance tothe words ''dangerously vulnerable'' and cleverly subverting this actress's trademark wide-eyed goofiness. Unfortunately, Ms. Steenburgen is lodged in a preachy work that devotes more time to cultivating themes than characters. Mr. Donaghy, the gifted author of ''Minutes From the Blue Route,'' specializes in the fractured suburban family, but here he has found little new to sayon the subject. And Neil Pepe's straightforward staging never quite makes sense of the play's shifts between barbed dialogues and self-explanatory soliloquies. With Garret Dillahunt as an obsessive-compulsive father and Mary McCann as a runaway Mom (2:00). Atlantic, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $40 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>+ ''LIFEGAME.'' The Improbable Theater, the inventive young British troupe that turned Scotch tape into ectoplasm in the haunted house play ''70 Hill Lane,'' is now turning instant biography into instant, multiform theater. The appearling show is based riskily on the classic premises that everyone has a story to tell and that no examined life is truly boring. Each evening a pre-selected volunteer is brought onstage and asked basic biographical questions. The answers are quickly turned into vignettes by the seven-member ensemble. the result is less Jerry Springer than Federico Fellini; that is, as in the later, warmer memory films of Fellini; that is, as in the later, warmer which childhood recollections are recreated with both comic flourish and deep wistfulness. The overall effect is of a glowing gentleness, of curiosity coupled with respect. Any dry or feelings of suspense and good will for the people onstage (2:00). Jane Street Theater, 113 Jane Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 5 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets, $25 to $37.50 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>''ARABIAN NIGHTS.'' Oh, what wonders are to be beheld ont he stage of the New Victory Theater: great hoards of gold and silver, a valley of diamonds, magical birds, ghouls, a wicked sorceress, mena dn women turned to stone and restored to life. Here are high adventure, low comedy, tales of peril and death and lessons to live by. The source of these wonders is the Young vic Theater Company of London and its scintillating production of ''Arabian Nights,'' intended for audiences at least 7 years old. Adapted and directed by Dominic Cooke, this imaginative display of theater magic weaves its spell from rich strands of fine acting, riveting storytelling, music, dance, puppetry, design, lighting and costumes. Of course, the framing device is the tale of the beautiful and brave young Scheherazade, who literally risks her neck for her despairing people after the sultan, embittered by his wife's infidelity, orders the beheading of each of her successors after a single night. With the women of the kingdom in terror, Scheherazade carries out a plan to so beguile the sultan with her tales that each morning he will postpone her execution (2:00). New Victory, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 7; tomorrow at 1 and 7 p.m.; Sunday noon and 5 p.m. Tickets $10 to $25 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
