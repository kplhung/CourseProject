        <p>Technology stocks soared yesterday, lifting the Nasdaq composite index to its third-biggest gain ever as upbeat profit reports and a sunny forecast by Nokia dispelled many of the clouds hanging over Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Continuing a rebound that began in the depths of near-panic selling Wednesday morning, stocks climbed steadily through the day, with all the main gauges finishing near their best levels. The Nasdaq surged 7.79 percent, a move exceeded only by the 7.94 percent advance on May 30 and the 7.87 percent gain posted last Friday.</p>
        <p>''They were looking for an excuse to rally,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates in Greenwich, Conn., referring to a battered high-technology sector, where semiconductor shares had dropped 45 percent from their peak. ''All of a sudden,'' he said, ''all the pieces were in place.''</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq gain amounted to 247.04 points, putting the index at 3,418.60 and narrowing its loss this year to 16 percent. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index advanced 46.63 points, or 3.5 percent, to 1,388.76. As for the Dow Jones industrial average, which tends to lag when Nasdaq soars, the gain was 167.96 points, or 1.7 percent. The blue-chip Dow climbed back above the 10,000 mark, to 10,142.98.</p>
        <p>Much of the buying was said to have come from individual investors, which along with many professionals seemed to have become overly demoralized by a steady barrage of warnings by leading companies that profits or sales would not meet expectations.</p>
        <p>''There were disappointments, sure,'' said Jeffrey Warantz, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. ''But we knew earnings were going to slow down,'' he added. What happened was that ''investors had gone wild and taken more off the stocks than was warranted.''</p>
        <p>Amid the bargain hunting, some mutual funds may have built up more cash than they needed to meet anticipated redemptions during the market's rocky performance since early September, while others may simply have finished the selling they wanted to do for tax reasons as the end of the fiscal year approaches.</p>
        <p>Still other investors who had bet on a continued decline -- before yesterday the Nasdaq had declined every day but two this month -- were forced to buy stock to cover their short positions when the market turned up. Yesterday was the 13th anniversary of the 1987 crash.</p>
        <p>Nokia, the world's biggest maker of mobile phones, not only beat third-quarter profit forecasts but predicted a record fourth quarter. This was a week after Motorola, No. 2 in the field, cautioned that earnings would lag into next year, prompting a sell-off. Nokia rose $8.13, to $38.13.</p>
        <p>Microsoft, which reported its earnings after the close of the market on Wednesday, leaped $10.13, to $61.88, making the biggest positive impact on the three main gauges. A total of 127 million Microsoft shares changed hands, the third-heaviest trading of its shares on record.</p>
        <p>The Dow's biggest gainers after Microsoft, which accounted for more than one-third of the total, were J. P. Morgan, up $8, to $142.25; Hewlett-Packard, up $5.38, to $90.94; and Intel, which rose $3.75, to $41.94.</p>
        <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson, down $2.50, to $91.75, in a weak drug group, was the biggest drag on the Dow.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Rise  By Bloomberg News</p>
        <p>Treasury prices rose yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said productivity gains were keeping inflation in check.</p>
        <p>The price of the 10-year note rose 3/32, to 100 24/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.65 percent from 5.66 percent. The 30-year bond rose 8/32, to 107 2/32. Its yield dropped to 5.75 percent from 5.77 percent.</p>
        <p>Bonds rose and notes pared losses after Mr. Greenspan and Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, said there was little evidence that growth in worker productivity was slowing.</p>
