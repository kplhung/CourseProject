        <p>Bucking a marked downward trend among rivals, Nokia of Finland, the world's leading mobile phone manufacturer, reported a 40 percent gain in third-quarter earnings today.

        <p>Bucking a marked downward trend among rivals, Nokia of Finland, the world's leading mobile phone manufacturer, reported a 40 percent gain in third-quarter earnings today. The results were far stronger than expected and contributed to a broad rebound in depressed technology stocks in Europe and the United States.</p>
        <p>Nokia said third-quarter earnings rose to 892 million euros, or $749 million, from 638 million euros in the quarter a year earlier. Sales increased 50 percent, to 7.57 billion euros, and the company said it expected an increase of 25 percent to 35 percent in sales next year.</p>
        <p>The earnings increase was more than double the 17 percent gain that had been widely expected by securities analysts. Nokia shares rose 22 percent, their biggest daily increase ever, to 43.67 euros, or about $36.68, erasing more than half their 41 percent fall since July. In the United States, Nokia's American depository receipts rose $8.13, or 27 percent, to $38.13.</p>
        <p>Nokia's performance contrasted sharply with rivals, including Motorola, the world's No. 2 mobile phone maker; Matsushita Communications Industrial; and Royal Philips Electronics -- which all cut their estimates of mobile phone sales recently. Nokia said more than 400 million mobile phones would be sold this year, bringing the total number of people with cell phones to 700 million by the end of this year and to one billion -- one fifth of the world's population -- by 2002.</p>
        <p>Nokia's chief executive, Jorma Ollila, said the results showed that ''Nokia is in better shape than ever to lead the market and technology development ahead.'' Nokia ascribed its bullish results to its practice of introducing ever-newer models, enabling it to erode its rivals' share of the market. In the third quarter alone it introduced seven models.</p>
        <p>The Swedish mobile phone maker Ericsson, the world's third-largest manufacturer and Nokia's rival, is set to announce third-quarter results on Friday and analysts were forecasting an 18 percent earnings gain. Ericsson shares rose as much as 6.2 percent today, roughly in line with other European technology stocks like Alcatel and Siemens. Over all, Ericsson says it is expecting losses in its mobile phone business for the full year.</p>
        <p>Nokia had initially planned to publish its results a week from today, but the company said it changed the date because of the volatility of global markets. Mr. Ollila, the chief executive, said in a conference call that the company had increased its market share in the third quarter ''and our target for the ongoing quarter is to strengthen it even further.''</p>
