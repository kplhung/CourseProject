        <p>The retired head of the Salvadoran National Guard admitted in court today that he knew that his troops, five of whom were convicted in the killings of four American churchwomen in 1980, had been involved in the torture and killings of civilians when he was appointed to lead the guard in 1979.</p>
        <p>The commander, Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, a colonel at the time, insisted that he did not have the resources to root out wrongdoers.</p>
        <p>He and former Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia, who was defense minister, are co-defendants in a federal wrongful-death suit brought by the women's relatives. The four were raped and shot on Dec. 2, 1980. Although the guard members were convicted in 1984, no higher-ranking officer has been held accountable.</p>
        <p>In a day of sometimes testy direct examination, Mr. Vides Casanova said he was aware of torture cells in the guard headquarters that had been used by the government of Gen. Carlos Humberto Romero, who was ousted in a coup in October 1979.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vides Casanova said that despite his suspicions he did not prosecute any officers over atrocities. Instead, he said, when he took command, he issued an order that his troops not engage in illegal interrogations or executions.</p>
        <p>''Why was it necessary to send such an order?'' the plaintiffs' lawyer, Robert Montgomery, asked.</p>
        <p>''The face that the National Guard had was of being the most violent body,'' the defendant said. ''I did everything humanly possible to correct all those deficiencies. But it is not easy to change a tradition of 50 years overnight or to make democracy in a country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vides Casanova testified in the second week of the trial on the allegation that he and Mr. Garcia knew of abuses by the security forces but did nothing to stop them. The suit contends, as have an international Truth Commission and others, that he and Mr. Garcia obstructed the inquiry into the killing of the women and of government opponents.</p>
        <p>The day began with a litany of atrocities tallied by the Truth Commission. The panel said the military committed 85 percent of the executions, rapes and disappearances in the 12-year civil war in El Salvador. In the churchwomen's case, the report and declassified United States Embassy cables said Mr. Vides Casanova was uncooperative.</p>
        <p>Focusing on the November 1980 deaths of six leaders of the rebels' Democratic Revolutionary Front, or F.D.R., Mr. Montgomery showed Mr. Vides Casanova embassy cables implicating the National Guard a week before the churchwomen's slayings.</p>
        <p>''By killing leaders of the F.D.R.,'' one cable said, ''the military has explicitly rejected dialogue and heralded an era of extremism. Those who kidnapped the F.D.R. leadership have warned the priests they are next if they did not stop poisoning the minds of the young.''</p>
        <p>The Roman Catholic Church, with its missionaries and laypeople who worked with the poor and opposed authoritarian rule in the war, was often a target of death threats and executions.</p>
        <p>In his testimony, Mr. Vides Casanova said he did not recall contacting a cousin, Col. Edgardo Casanova Vejar, commander of the zone where the women were abducted, around the time of the killings. Mr. Vides Casanova added that at no point in the inquiry did he contact his cousin, even though he had the authority to do so in an investigation.</p>
        <p>An inquiry that he later authorized was reluctantly led by a major who was accused in a report by a United States federal judge of muddying the investigation by transferring the men involved in the churchwomen's shootings and switching their rifles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vides Casanova insisted that although he could not recall exact conversations that he might have had with subordinates and diplomats, he had not hidden anything and that in some cases he had just recently come across reports that suggested otherwise.</p>
        <p>''I have never been interested in covering up anything,'' he said. ''I feel sorrow and regret that persons under me were perpetrators of these crimes. But this information, I only had knowledge of it only two years ago.''</p>
