        <p>Representative Bob Franks, the underfinanced underdog vying for the United States Senate, told a group of elderly voters here that his well-heeled opponent was distorting his record on Medicare.</p>
        <p>''I am terribly frustrated to turn on the television every day and every night and see a television commercial run by my opponent where he proclaims that Bob Franks cut Medicare by $200 billion,'' he said at the Bayshore Seniors Day Center in Monmouth County. ''Folks, it is simply not true.''</p>
        <p>With Election Day less than three weeks away, Mr. Franks, the Republican candidate, is filling his days with personal appearances throughout New Jersey to try to counter the barrage of advertising his Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine, has been able to buy in the New York and Philadelphia television markets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks finally began running his own television spots on New York stations this week, but his $150,000 budget pales against the $2 million or so Mr. Corzine is spending every week on TV time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks began his day greeting commuters at the Westfield train station in Union County, then spoke to veterans in Lyons in Somerset County, to the audience at the seniors center here, and finally to students at Rutgers University.</p>
        <p>With a large number of undecided voters in this race, Mr. Franks's campaign believes he still has a chance to woo enough people to his camp even though Mr. Corzine is comfortably ahead in the polls. While Mr. Franks has spent much of the last few weeks attending fund-raisers, he is now concentrating on voters, especially those who have a good record of turning out at the polls, like the elderly residents here.</p>
        <p>At the Bayshore center, Mr. Franks criticized Mr. Corzine for running an advertisement in which he accused Mr. Franks of cutting Medicare funds, a charge that is not quite accurate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks voted for the 1995 budget reconciliation bill, and a 1996 budget compromise, which included reductions in future Medicare spending. The Franks campaign notes that Medicare spending continued to grow, but at a slower pace. And, he told his audience, he worked with other legislators to reduce Medicare fraud and waste so that services could be expanded.</p>
        <p>''In 1995, Medicare didn't pay for mammograms,'' he said. ''Now, Medicare reimburses for mammograms. Five years ago, it didn't cover bone density testing against osteoporosis, but it does today. Five years ago, Medicare didn't reimburse for colorectal cancer screening. It does today.''</p>
        <p>''Jon Corzine should stop trying to scare New Jersey seniors with claims that are simply untrue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, meanwhile, spoke at a meeting of about 100 union officials in Atlantic City and later to a rally of about 500 home health care workers on the front steps of the State House.</p>
        <p>The union leaders belong to the New Jersey State Industrial Union Council, which has about 300,000 members. The council's president, Bill Kane, called Mr. Corzine a man who ''answers to no one but himself'' and praised him for his willingness to help working-class families.</p>
        <p>In a 15-minute speech, Mr. Corzine outlined some basic campaign themes: support for affirmative action, abortion rights and affordable universal health care, and opposition to school vouchers and privatization of any Social Security financing.</p>
        <p>Then he flew by helicopter to Trenton for the noontime labor rally. The health care workers want their hourly pay, now between $7 and $8, increased by $1, and the financing for their health benefits increased by 50 cents an hour. In brief remarks endorsing their campaign, Mr. Corzine said: ''We have to make sure people have a living wage.''</p>
