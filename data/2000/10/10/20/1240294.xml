        <p>Several New Jersey civil rights leaders and black lawmakers said today they are concerned that state officials are preparing to offer a plea bargain to the two state troopers who shot three unarmed minority men during a traffic stop in 1998, in order to avoid a prolonged criminal trial focusing on racial profiling.</p>

        <p>Several New Jersey civil rights leaders and black lawmakers said today they are concerned that state officials are preparing to offer a plea bargain to the two state troopers who shot three unarmed minority men during a traffic stop in 1998, in order to avoid a prolonged criminal trial focusing on racial profiling.</p>
        <p>The troopers, John Hogan and James Kenna, were indicted on charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault, for wounding passengers of a van they stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike -- a case that transformed racial profiling into a national issue. But prosecutors said last month that evidence recently gleaned from two eyewitnesses has made them consider dropping the most serious charges against at least one officer, and there have been several discussions about possible plea bargains since then.</p>
        <p>Robert Galantucci, the lawyer representing Trooper Hogan, declined to comment on the discussions, and in an interview today said only: ''There is no agreement, and I don't think there's going to be an agreement.''</p>
        <p>James J. Gerrow, the special state prosecutor assigned to the case, has refused to discuss the case, as has Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, however, documents have emerged showing that state law enforcement officials concealed detailed evidence of racial profiling from the public for years, providing fresh ammunition for the troopers' lawyers to argue that state police commanders condoned racial profiling. So today, when a newspaper published details about another proposed plea agreement, which would spare the troopers prison time, black legislators warned that the special state prosecutor not be swayed by the specter of more bad publicity.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman LeRoy Jones, a Democrat from Essex County, warned that if any plea bargain is viewed as an attempt at political damage control, it would undermine efforts to rebuild the reputation of the State Police in minority neighborhoods. ''This is the same old story in which black men get attacked by police and the offending officers get protected by the system,'' said Mr. Jones, who is black. ''It fosters resentment and distrust. It sends the signal that the status quo will endure and that reform will only be cosmetic. The prosecutor has the responsibility to administer justice, not deals.''</p>
        <p>Racial profiling has been one of New Jersey's dominant political issues since the night of April 23, 1998, when Troopers Hogan and Kenna stopped a van near Exit 7A of the turnpike. The four occupants of the van -- three of them black, the other Latino -- were driving to a basketball camp in North Carolina. Moments later, the officers opened fire, wounding three of the van's occupants.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors originally pushed for the attempted murder charges, arguing that forensic evidence rebutted the troopers' claims that they shot in self-defense after the van rolled backward and knocked Trooper Hogan to the ground. But in April 2000, nearly two years after the incident, two new witnesses emerged and gave statements that corroborated some of the troopers' account.</p>
        <p>In the months since the testimony of those witnesses has become public, prosecutors have indicated that they may drop the attempted murder charge against Trooper Hogan. Superior Court Judge Andrew J. Smithson has said that on Oct. 31 he will rule on the defense motion to dismiss all charges because of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>
        <p>But civil rights leaders say that they will be dismayed if the troopers are offered a lenient plea bargain.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey, said that he would be disappointed by any plea agreement that did not compel the troopers to admit they stopped the van simply because of the drivers' race and to name supervisors who taught and condoned racial profiling.</p>
        <p>If the troopers balk at such an offer, however, the state faces the unsettling prospect of going to trial against troopers who might defend themselves by claiming they were trained and ordered to single out black and Latino motorists.</p>
        <p>''I think that's something the state would be very uneasy about and have great difficulty rebutting, especially  in light of its own admissions about profiling,'' Reverend Jackson said.</p>
