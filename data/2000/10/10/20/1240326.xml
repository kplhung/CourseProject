        <p>The code division multiple access technology of Qualcomm Inc. has been given a second chance in China, months after the country's second-largest mobile phone company, China Unicom Ltd., said it had decided not to back the system. Qualcomm's technology is a rival to the global system for mobile communications, which is more widely used in China. China Unicom's president, Wang Jianzhou, said Wednesday that his company would take over and expand a trial system using Qualcomm's technology that now serves one million customers, but that Unicom would let ''market demand'' determine which system would survive. The decision came after heavy lobbying by the United States government and Qualcomm's chairman, Irwin Jacobs, who met with China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji, this month.</p>
