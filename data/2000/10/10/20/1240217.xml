        <p>Among the diplomats and foreign leaders flocking here to congratulate Serbia and greet the newly elected Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, this week, the heir to the Yugoslav throne, Crown Prince Alexander, has stood out in his enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>Beaming broadly, the 55-year-old British-educated prince and his wife, Katarina, have been touring the country his father fled and promising to return to live here.</p>
        <p>''My family belongs here,'' he said today at the end of his visit. ''I have been a refugee for 55 years, and I do not want to be one for 56 years.''</p>
        <p>With the collapse of Slobodan Milosevic and his ''negative nationalism,'' as the prince described it, Serbia is once more casting around for something to believe in. Although he appears more like a British diplomat than a Serbian king, Crown Prince Alexander has made it clear he intends to help his country now that Mr. Milosevic, whom he openly criticized, has left power.</p>
        <p>This was only his third visit to Serbia, and he has never lived in his homeland. The house of Karadjordjevic ruled Yugoslavia from 1918 to 1941, when his father, King Peter, fled the Nazi invasion. After the war the Communist leader, Marshal Tito,  branded the royal family enemies of the state and confiscated their property.</p>
        <p>Crown Prince Alexander was born in 1945 in a room in Claridges Hotel in London. Although the room was declared a piece of Yugoslav territory for the moment of his birth, he has lived all his life in Britain and speaks Serbian only haltingly. He makes his living as a businessman in London.</p>
        <p>Showing himself something of a diplomat, he dodged questions all week on whether he wanted to be king of Yugoslavia. ''I do not wish to talk of fairy tales,'' he said. ''I personally believe everyone is a king and queen. I am coming back slowly. We'll take things step by step.''</p>
        <p>There is no overwhelming enthusiasm for a return of the monarchy in Serbia. Crowds of several hundred people gathered to meet the prince as he toured the country, visiting churches and towns, the graves of his ancestors and factories and mines.</p>
        <p>His first gesture was to show his support for the opposition leaders and demonstrators who led the uprising against Mr. Milosevic two weeks ago. He met with President Kostunica, the Serbian Orthodox Church leader, Patriarch Pavle, and members of the student movement Otpor, and traveled to congratulate the miners of Kolubara who proved pivotal in facing down the regime.</p>
        <p>But it was in the small town of Cacak, in the heartland of Serbia, where he was met with an emotional welcome, with speeches, a brass band and a crowd of some 5,000 organized by the mayor and local hero, Velimir Ilic.</p>
        <p>''When we were protesting we said who our first guest would be when we won, and he is here today,'' Mr. Ilic told the crowd, introducing the crown prince.</p>
        <p>Orthodox monks and nuns jostled for a place on stage as young men waved banners and shouted, ''Long live the king!'' As the old Yugoslav national anthem played across the square on loudspeakers, with its famous line ''God save the Serbian king,'' people in the crowd stood to attention and wiped tears from their eyes.</p>
        <p>Many in the crowds were older people and families, and said they had come out of curiosity to see a part of their history. Others said they hoped the prince would help the country recover with economic and other aid.</p>
        <p>''It's good that you came and even better if you stay,'' shouted one miner from the back of the crowd at Kolubara.</p>
        <p>Clutching a signed photograph that aides of the prince handed out to the crowd, Miroljub Misic said: ''It's a big thing for Serbia. We have been waiting for 50 years through Communism for this. It is in our blood. We are all royalists, not Communists.''</p>
        <p>Others were more cautious. Some wondered if Serbia in its economic state could afford a king, or even whether there should be a referendum on the issue.</p>
        <p>''We need the king to be with us and get used to him,'' said another miner, Miodrag Simovic. ''Both sides need to get used to each other, and after five years or so, then we can tell.''</p>
        <p>A few small political parties support the idea of the monarchy, but it is not clear how strong public opinion is for its restoration. Polls in the mid-1990's showed a solid one-third support for the idea, and more than two-thirds over all said they would not object if it would bring stability, The Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>Members of the Orthodox Church appeared delighted at the crown prince's visit. ''I have no words,'' said an old priest, Radisav Obradovic, at St. Dmitri Church in the small town of Gornji Milanovac. ''Just look at the tears in my eyes. After so many years he is coming home.''</p>
        <p>''You can see how happy the people and the church are to see him back,'' he said. ''How can this really be our homeland if we do not have a king. Serbia is nothing without a king.''</p>
        <p>He said he thought the majority of Serbs would support a monarchy. ''It starts like a river and will grow,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The prince has been careful to emphasize the need for democracy first in Serbia and Montenegro, the last two republics of Yugoslavia, and said his main aim was to help bring badly needed aid to the country.</p>
        <p>But he said he intended to return to live in the country and might even apply for the return of family property, including the Beli Dvor, a former royal residence in Belgrade.</p>
        <p>Asked if he wanted a referendum on his becoming king, he said: ''We must allow some breathing space and show an ability to discuss this without overbearing pressure. The emphasis must be on developing democracy.''</p>
        <p>'''Half the countries in the European Union are constitutional monarchies, and a monarch can provide pride, unity and continuity,'' he said. ''But I also do admire the many republics.''</p>
