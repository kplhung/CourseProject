        <p>United Technologies Seen In Deal to Buy Honeywell  United Technologies, which makes everything from jet engines to elevators, is expected to acquire Honeywell International, the diversified manufacturer that merged with Allied Signal last year, for $40.3 billion in stock, executives close to the negotiations said.</p>
        <p>Both boards plan to meet today to vote on the acquisition, the executives said. The companies acknowledged that they were in talks, but declined to comment further. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Ban Is Urged on Medicine Ingredient  A panel of experts recommended that the Food and Drug Administration ban an ingredient in decongestants and appetite suppressants from over-the-counter medicines, citing new evidence that the chemical may increase the risk of stroke in young women. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Eli Lilly Ends Sepracor Agreement  Eli Lilly said that it had terminated its agreement with Sepracor, a small drug company, to make a new version of the antidepressant drug Prozac after some patients taking the new formulation in clinical trials developed abnormal heart rhythms. The news sent Sepracor's stock down $33.75, or almost 30 percent, to $87.06. Lilly fell 75 cents, to $88.50. [C6.]</p>
        <p>I.R.S. Seeks Credit Card Records  The Internal Revenue Service has asked a federal judge to issue summonses for two years' worth of records of MasterCard and American Express card transactions in the United States that were billed to bank accounts in Caribbean nations. Using the Internet and other outlets, banks in those nations openly solicit tax evasion in schemes, some using credit and charge cards, that the I.R.S. says have proved attractive to executives, business owners, physicians and other wealthy Americans. [A1.]</p>
        <p>A study of 250 publicly traded companies showed that 24 owed no tax or received credits against past or future tax obligations in 1998, up from 13 in 1997 and 16 in 1996. The study also found that 71 of the 250 companies paid taxes at less than half the official 35 percent corporate rate during the three years. [C2.]</p>
        <p>G.O.P. Chiefs Push Medicare Bill  Brushing aside objections from President Clinton, Republican leaders of Congress announced that they had agreed on a plan to pump $28 billion into Medicare over the next five years, mainly by increasing payments to health maintenance organizations, hospitals and others that care for the elderly. [A28.]</p>
        <p>Support Grows for Internet Filters  Congressional support is growing for efforts to require schools and libraries with Internet access to install software to block access to pornography, obscenity and materials considered harmful to minors. [A28.]</p>
        <p>Criticism Rises With Euro's Fall  Wim Duisenberg, the gruff and blunt-speaking president of the European Central Bank, acknowledged that he had blundered in his recent comments, suggesting that the central bank would not intervene again soon to strengthen the euro, and vowed to hold his tongue more in the future. With the euro sinking this week to a record low, Mr. Duisenberg has been criticized for saying things that in easier circumstances might have been quickly forgotten. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Greenspan Says Oil Has Small Effect  Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the effects on the economy from higher oil prices had been modest so far. And he said there had been almost no effect on inflation expectations, reducing the chances the oil prices could set off a destabilizing spiral of rising wages and prices. [C15.]</p>
        <p>The nation's trade deficit narrowed in August to $29.4 billion, a six-month low, as a surge in exports of aircraft engines, computer chips and other capital goods reduced the effect of record imports. [C6.]</p>
        <p>UAL Loss Is Larger Than Expected  UAL, the parent of United Airlines, reported a greater-than-expected third-quarter loss, paying the price for the record delays and flight cancellations this summer. [C16.]</p>
