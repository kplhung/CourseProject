        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>GREGG ALLMAN, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Midtown, (212) 997-4144. Moonlighting from the Allman Brothers Band, the weary-voiced singer behind the beefy, soul-tinged keyboard parts leads his own band, including Buzz Feiten on guitar. It should jam the old songs in less familiar directions. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; $70 (Jon Pareles).</p>

        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>GREGG ALLMAN, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Midtown, (212) 997-4144. Moonlighting from the Allman Brothers Band, the weary-voiced singer behind the beefy, soul-tinged keyboard parts leads his own band, including Buzz Feiten on guitar. It should jam the old songs in less familiar directions. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; $70 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>BAD RELIGION, Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 247-0200. Greg Graffin has called punk a form of folk music and aspires to be its Woody Guthrie. This year Mr. Graffin, a 36-year-old singer-songwriter, celebrates the 20th anniversary of his band, Bad Religion, with more touring, spreading the news about progressive politics, environmentalism and other matters close to his heart. Though he is preparing for a future without the band by completing his degree in zoology at Cornell, Mr. Graffin has also said that Bad Religion's tuneful, muscle-heavy rock could continue to interest him and the band for another two decades. As long as young people seek inspired truth-tellers in leather jackets, he's probably right. The Promise Ring opens this show. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $22.50 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>* THE BEAUTIFUL SOUTH, Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 247-0200. Radiohead may be getting all the buzz these days, but for a truly English pop experience check out this band, whose eighth album is giving the anointed of art rock trouble at the top of the British charts. The Beautiful South uses soul music and acerbic lyrics to update the British music hall tradition with such ebullience that few Britons can resist. It's truly fun and intelligent music that more Americans should discover and love. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.; tickets are $22.50 (Powers).</p>
        <p>BUDDHIST RITUAL SONG AND DANCE FROM KOREA, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. The Young San Preservation group, led by the female monk Dong Hee, has revived an ancient and elaborate Korean Buddhist ceremony. The uniquely Korean Young San ceremony, which was suppressed when Japan colonized Korea from 1910 to 1945, includes ritual dances accompanied by gongs, drums and cymbals as well as somber chants that, like Gregorian chant, are sung in unison without a beat. It is described as ''the sound of ecstasy and the nectar of enlightenment.'' Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $26; $15 for students (Pareles).</p>
        <p>SHIRLEY CAESAR, YOLANDA ADAMS, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212) 496-7070. Two generations of gospel singers share this bill, called ''Sisters in the Spirit.'' Shirley Caesar comes from the junction of gospel music and Southern soul; with her gutsy voice and the timing of a performer who has been on the circuit for decades, she preaches stories that turn into fervently devoted songs. Yolanda Adams is a devout virtuoso who summons both jazz agility and soul flamboyance; she has made it her mission to carry gospel messages to the hip-hop generation. Sunday at 7:30 p.m.; tickets are $35 to $50 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* RAY CHARLES, Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833. If Ray Charles isn't the greatest American singer, he's definitely one of the top contenders. His voice is full of pain and jubilation, cockiness and despair, wisdom and impulsiveness; he knows American music from the blues to Tin Pan Alley to gospel to jazz. Tonight at 8; tickets are $30 and $35 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>LOU DONALDSON QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. The crown prince of blues and bop, Mr. Donaldson is a saxophonist who reminds you of the earthiness inside jazz. He is also a wild, funny character who always plays better than you expect on an average night. Sets through Sunday are at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., with a 1 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow night. Cover: $20; $10 minimum; $15 cover for Sunday (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>DOOBIE BROTHERS, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212) 496-7070. Tom Johnston, who led the Doobie Brothers through their first phase of hit-making, is back in charge of the band, which has just released a new album. But it isn't likely to forgo its early-1970's hits like ''Listen to the Music,'' ''China Grove'' and ''Long Train Runnin'.'' Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $35 to $75 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>DIZZY GILLESPIE ALUMNI ALL-STARS, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. The now-frequent reunions of musicians who used to perform with Gillespie can be unpredictable fun. Musicians this weekend include Jon Faddis, James Moody, Lewis Nash, Paquito D'Rivera and the indefatigable, brilliant-when-he-wants-to-be Clark Terry. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 9 and 11:30; cover charge is $30; $20 for bar; $5 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>LARRY HARLOW AND THE LATIN LEGENDS, Supper Club, 240 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 921-1940. One of the in-house wizards behind the sound and style that made up New York's Fania label in the 1960's and 70's, Mr. Harlow can be a tremendously exciting pianist -- far more than his reputation, which cloisters him in the salsa scene, would indicate. He will have the driving cuatro player Yomo Toro, another Fania regular, on hand in this combo. Tomorrow night at 12:30 a.m.; admission is $25 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* JIMMY HEATH BIG-BAND BIRTHDAY BASH, Flushing Town Hall, 137-35 Northern Boulevard, Queens, (718) 463-7700. Mr. Heath, an early associate of John Coltrane and one of the great sax players of the generation that was there when bebop was a growing kind of music, makes jazz look easy; he has humor, style and an amazing grasp of harmony. In his case age is just another word for maturity. He is celebrating his 74th birthday onstage with a band that includes the trombonist Benny Powell. Tonight at 8; tickets are $24 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>MAGIC SLIM AND THE TEARDROPS, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Morris Holt, a k a Magic Slim, followed the classic Chicago blues trajectory: born in Mississippi in 1937, he went to Chicago in his teens and worked his way up to being a mainstay of the city's South Side club circuit, playing hard-luck blues with guitar solos that poke and jab over his band's lean, assertive vamps. Sunday at 8 and 10:30 p.m.; admission is $25 at tables and $10 minimum; $15 at the bar, with no minimum (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MAT MANERI QUARTET, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319. The violinist Mat Maneri loves in-between material: microtonal notes and rhythms that are stretched out to accommodate all sorts of interior filigree. Through the 90's he was associated with outskirts-of-jazz musicians like Matthew Shipp, Joe Morris and his father, Joe Maneri; this is his own band, with the terrific saxophone player Tony Malaby, the bassist Jerome Harris and the drummer Randy Peterson. Tonight at 9; cover charge is $10; $5 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>MASTERS OF NORTH AND SOUTH INDIAN MUSIC, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. A double bill of improvisatory Indian classical music features a vocalist and  father-and-daughter violinists. Padma Talwalka sings khyal songs, a North Indian vocal tradition; she has studied the three main schools of khyal improvisation. M. S. Gopalakrishnan, the elder violinist, is one of the few musicians who performs both north Indian (Hindustani) and south Indian (Carnatic) styles of improvisation; he shares the stage with his daughter and disciple, M. Narmada, who studied with both her father and her grandfather. Tonight at 8; tickets are $25 and $30, $15 for students (Pareles).</p>
        <p>ROBERTA PIKET TRIO, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319. A studious mainstream-jazz pianist who is extending the lineage of Chick Corea, McCoy Tyner and Richie Beirach, Ms. Piket leads an interactive trio that has been working as much as any local jazz band in recent months. Sunday at 9 p.m.; cover charge is $10; $5 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>CHARLIE PIGGOTT AND GERRY HARRINGTON, Blarney Star, 43 Murray Street, TriBeCa, (212) 732-2873. Traditional Irish music for button accordion and fiddle. Tonight at 9 and 10:30; admission is $10 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MICHELE ROSEWOMAN TRIO, Up Over Jazz Cafe, 351 Flatbush Avenue, at Seventh Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 398-5413. Ms. Rosewoman, a pianist, was one of the earliest of the contemporary jazz players to find ways to integrate Cuban religious music into her own post-bop training. Her trio includes the bassist Rufus Reid and the drummer John Lamkin. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 10:30 and midnight; cover charge is $18 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>HILTON RUIZ SEXTET, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. One of the best Latin-jazz players in New York since the 1970's, Mr. Ruiz leads a group this week that includes the saxophonist Craig Handy, the trumpeter Ryan Kisor and the percussionist Renato Thoms. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $20; $10 minimum; $17.50 on Sundays (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>JIMMY SMITH QUARTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Soul-jazz organ playing as a genre seems to owe its life to Jimmy Smith, who carved out much of its musical language as well as its market success in the mid-50's. He's still at it, and this week his band includes the amazingly fluent guitarist Russell Malone. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8 and 10:30, with a $25 cover charge; Sunday night's sets are at 7 and 9, with a $18 cover; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
