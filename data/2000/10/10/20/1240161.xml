      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>All over New York multiple sins have been committed in the name of baba gannouj. Hummus has been subjected to unspeakable acts. Right off the bat, Mamlouk deserves praise for restoring luster to these Middle Eastern staples. The hummus has no tricks up its sleeve other than fresh ingredients mixed in the proper proportions and a texture that's pure satin. The same goes for the wonderfully smoky baba gannouj, sprinkled with a few jewel-like pomegranate seeds. These two classics made up only two-fifths of the first course in Mamlouk's set menu the night I ate there. They were joined by a puree of red bell peppers thickened with ground walnuts, a salsalike avocado salad and a sweet, syrupy mound of grilled marinated bell peppers.</p>
        <p>Next came fatoush, a mint-accented salad strewn with crisp pita chips. Then there was a vegetarian moussaka, the Egyptian-style tomato-eggplant stew rather than the Greek dish of the same name, followed by hefty chunks of lamb shank in a creamy, lemony sauce based on dried yogurt and topped with toasted pine nuts. There was more to come: chicken in a dense lentil puree, and then zarda, a rustic Iraqi rice pudding, not too sweet, with baked apple slices and walnuts.</p>

        <p>Mamlouk is the younger sibling of the two Moustache restaurants in Greenwich Village. Salam al-Rawi, the owner and chef, shuffles the menu nightly, roaming all over the Middle East from Egypt to Jordan to Iran and his native Iraq. The fixed menu puts all the decisions in his very able hands, so diners need only show up, order a pot of mint tea and wait for the culinary trip to begin. Tables for two are closely spaced and rather uncomfortable. Parties of four get more room and much less chance of watching the dishwashers at work. For $15, diners can order a hookah and puff away like the caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland.</p>
        <p>Mamlouk, 211 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 529-3477. Dinner, $30.</p>
