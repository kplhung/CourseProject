        <p>When the Rangers put the 23-year-old defenseman Jason Doig on waivers this week, they were gambling that they could sneak him through so they could send him to the minor leagues without losing his rights.</p>
        <p>The gamble paid off yesterday: Doig cleared waivers and was assigned to Hartford of the American Hockey League along with the rookie goaltender Jason LaBarbera. A spot opened for Doig in Hartford when Martin Richter, the Rangers' ninth-round selection in last summer's draft, was returned to the Czech Elite League. The Rangers also returned defenseman David Wilkie to Houston of the International Hockey League.</p>
