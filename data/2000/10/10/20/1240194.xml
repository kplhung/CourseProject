        <p>WHATEVER the flaw that causes some Firestone tires to shed their treads, with sometimes lethal results, the company says that failure is highly unlikely if the tires are inflated properly.</p>
        <p>Because the flaw remains unknown, that contention is unproved, but Congress evidently agrees with Firestone. An auto safety bill that both houses overwhelmingly approved last week made headlines mainly for increasing penalties for executives who hide safety defects. But it also included a provision that would eventually require systems to let a driver read the tire pressure on the car's instrument panel, similar to the dashboard warnings for low oil levels or high coolant temperature.</p>
        <p>Several variations of systems that monitor tire pressure already exist. In the past, they have been marketed as a way to avoid flat tires. Now, there is an additional safety angle, because of the seeming propensity of a Ford Explorer to roll over if one of its tires falls apart.</p>
        <p>Some new cars come from the factory with such devices, and systems will soon be available that can be added on to older cars.</p>
        <p>''How often do you check your tire pressure?'' asked Phillip G. Zaroor, president and chief executive of Advantage Enterprises Inc. of Harrisonville, Mo., which makes a device that checks tires every four seconds. Few drivers regularly monitor tire pressures, he said. And most cannot identify an underinflated radial tire at a glance, as they could with earlier bias-ply tires.</p>
        <p>Underinflation can cause tire failure, according to Firestone, because if the tire sags too much, the sidewalls flex as the tire rotates, building up heat. The statement is drawn from simple observation, because Firestone says the mechanism that leads to tire failure is still unknown.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zaroor's device, called PressurePro, is a simple add-on: a Chap Stick-size device that screws unto each valve stem, in lieu of the cap. Inside is a battery pack, consisting of three button cells, a pressure monitor and a radio transmitter. The system comes with a receiver that could be mistaken, at first glance, for a radar detector. It plugs into the cigarette lighter for power.</p>
        <p>The transmitter works whenever the vehicle is traveling 10 miles an hour or faster, and its signal carries 100 feet, so it works well on a trailer hauled behind a recreational vehicle, Mr. Zaroor said. The receiver unit can be programmed to emit a warning beep at a certain pressure level.</p>
        <p>Like garage door openers, each transmitter sends a coded signal, to avoid being picked up by the wrong receiver. More than 4,000 have been sold, mostly for recreational vehicles and trucks, he said.</p>
        <p>But the original model is a bit long, and, if installed on the valve stem of a car tire, which is set at a 15-degree angle, it would protrude beyond the edge of the tire and could be damaged if, for example, the car scuffed the curb. In addition, if the unit failed, it could deflate the tire. (The stems on truck tires are typically not angled, which allows the device to stay within the wheel area.)</p>
        <p>That system had a retail price of $179, but is probably not available on store shelves any longer, he said.</p>
        <p>A new version, intended to have a retail price of less than $100, is due out in February. Because it uses more advanced microelectronics, it is smaller and does not protrude from the tire. It also uses less power, and so requires only one battery instead of three, and that battery is supposed to last for two years, twice as long as those in the original device. And, he said, the device cannot deflate the tire.</p>
        <p>Another company, Schrader-Bridgeport, part of Tompkins P.L.C., sells SmartValve, a unit that alerts the driver when a tire is low, for $275; a model that specifies which tire, and by how much, is $363. The company, best known for its conventional pencil-type tire-pressure gauges, as well as for its tire valves, also provides the tire-monitoring units that are standard equipment on the Chevrolet Corvette and Plymouth Prowler. The company's Web address is www.schrader-bridgeport.net/ssv.</p>
        <p>SmarTire Systems Inc., of Richmond, British Columbia, has been making tire monitors for years, but is only now nearing mass production of a system that is likely to have wide appeal. Its technology was first used on gigantic vehicles in open-pit mines, where big tires can cost tens of thousands of dollars each.</p>
        <p>In 1997, tire makers came to SmarTire to develop a system that would warn the driver of a car with ''run flat'' tires that a tire was actually flat, said Charlene Krepiakevich, a spokeswoman for the company.</p>
        <p>''Run-flat tires are designed to allow you to continue to drive safely,'' she said. ''But if you don't know it's gone flat, eventually you'll be stranded.''</p>
        <p>To prevent that from happening, the company developed a temperature and pressure monitor that is strapped inside the wheel. Like Mr. Zaroor's device, it broadcasts to a monitor in the passenger compartment.</p>
        <p>But run-flat tires have not yet caught on. And partly because installation of the SmarTire unit is complicated, the system had sold for about $300 for light vehicles and $400 for vehicles that are heavier or have more than four wheels.</p>
        <p>Now, Ms. Krepiakevich said, SmarTire is anticipating a booming market, and mass production should lower prices. A new, refined version of its hardware will go into mass production soon, she said. It has a battery that will last seven years, which, she said, is almost certainly longer than the life of the tire.</p>
        <p>Temperature and pressure usually move in tandem, so measuring one should generally be adequate, but SmarTire measures both. John I. Bolegoh, manager of technical services at the company, said that if a tire developed a slow leak on the highway, the normal rise in temperature during highway driving might mask the leak by indicating stable tire pressure. SmarTire would give early warning of a problem, he said. Or if a brake was dragging, the temperature of one tire might rise much higher than the others', another early warning sign.</p>
        <p>The company plans to distribute the device through after-market auto parts stores. It has also signed a deal with TRW, a big parts supplier, to try to have its product included on new cars. That would permit a variety of built-in display systems, Ms. Krepiakevich said. A description is available at www.smartire.com/fl/.</p>
        <p>Maintaining tire pressure would have other benefits, including less tire wear, lower fuel consumption and better handling.</p>
        <p>And a factory-installed model could also establish the appropriate inflation for a new car. A study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that most people inflate their tires to the maximum pressure stated on the sidewall, not to the manufacturer's instructions in the owner's manual or on the door post, two more obscure locations.</p>
        <p>Just what the Federal rule will require will not be clear for months. Congress gave the Transportation Department a year to develop rules requiring a warning system for tire pressure. The rule would be applied to new cars two years after it was published.</p>
        <p>Until then, of course, one can always use the old-fashioned tire-pressure gauge.</p>
