        <p>''Ah am talkin' 'bout YOU!'' cried 5Al Gore at a big rally in Flint, Mich. Populist Al is back, sounding as if he had just emerged from the overnight shift at the steel mill. Like George W. Bush, Mr. Gore is more Southern on some days than others. The one thing we know about the next administration is that it will be headed by a guy with hot and cold running accents.</p>
        <p>Emotionally, at least, Mr. Gore has been on a roll. It'll be interesting to see whether those pesky undecided voters have another reversal of momentum left in them. Gore-Bush-Gore-Bush -- the polls are starting to look like DNA. We could keep doing this over and over until Nov. 7, like musical chairs. Last guy to grab the Big Mo wins. Last guy to grab any Mo wins.</p>
        <p>The debate thrilled the Gore campaign. More important, even the crowd in Flint caught the tide and bellowed ''You won! You won!'' as Mr. Gore, in shirtsleeves, beamed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has been to a million town halls like the one on TV Tuesday. His  questioners usually try to go for his strong suit, the cerebral. A man this week asked him to recompute the rate of return on Social Security. Mr. Bush has been to a lot of town halls this year too, but the questions tend to be less demanding. ''Can I have a hug?'' a woman asked the other day. Hugging is, of course, what governors do. But it is not all that great of a preparation for standing on national television and having an average citizen ask whether you actually enjoy executing murderers.</p>
        <p>Did the Undecided Voters notice that Mr. Gore sounded smarter? Will they reward him with a bump in the weekend polls? Who are these people, anyway? Are they really undecided, or are they just holding out for a gig in a network focus group? Do they e-mail each other, taking secret votes on whether or not to send the CNN tracking poll up 15 points tomorrow?</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, at least, seems to feel they're paying attention, and that they're good for at least one more total reversal of direction. ''You are the wind beneath my wings! That's how I feel right now!'' he cried to the crowd in Flint after delivering the requisite smooch to Tipper.</p>
        <p>He described his opponent as the sort of guy who will ''just talk and talk and give all these fancy words. . . .'' This is how you know a campaign is coming near the end -- when Al Gore starts warning people about George W. Bush, that silver-tongued devil with the stuck-up vocabulary.</p>
        <p>But it can't hurt Mr. Gore's chances that he seems to be feeling more energized. When he gets that way, he goes into emotional overdrive. He could get worked up while waiving the reading of the minutes of the last meeting. ''I said before and I'll say again -- and this is controversial at a gut level -- I don't believe the presidency is a popularity contest,'' he told a group of senior citizens in Des Moines.</p>
        <p>Seated in the audience was Winnie Skinner, the elderly Iowan who became a star after she told Mr. Gore that she pays for her prescription drugs by collecting recyclable cans. Like a lot of Mr. Gore's examples of true-life woe, Ms. Skinner's lot turned out to be not quite so bad as it seemed at first. Her son in Texas informed the press that he had plenty of money and was perfectly willing to help out his mother, if only she'd let him.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore, who has had to drop all the references to the girl who had to stand during science class in Florida and the dog whose arthritis medicine was cheaper than his mother-in-law's, was not willing to abandon Ms. Skinner, his favorite Real Person. ''The national media tried to make a big deal out of the fact her son is well-to-do. She doesn't have to pick up cans to pay for her prescription drugs. She can go and ask her son for money. But you don't want to do that, do you, Winnie?'' said the vice president.</p>
        <p>Everybody loves spunky old ladies with attitude. But in the great scheme of things, it's hard to see Ms. Skinner as the reason we need a multibillion-dollar prescription drug program for the elderly. If Mr. Gore loses, we may look back and conclude that his fatal error was that his Real People had too much money. It's easy to locate impoverished seniors or schools without enough desks. But finding them in middle-class neighborhoods in swing states is a challenge.</p>
        <p>Maybe the Real People and the Undecided Voters are the same human beings. For this election, there are only about 20 of them, and they run the country.</p>
