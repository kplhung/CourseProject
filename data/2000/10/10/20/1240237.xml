        <p>Peace in Northern Ireland is once again precarious. Support for the Good Friday peace agreement signed in 1998 has dropped dangerously among Protestants, mainly over the issues of a new name for Northern Ireland's police and the Irish Republican Army's reluctance to give up its weapons. Later this month the council of the Ulster Unionist Party, the major Protestant party in the peace agreement, will meet. While it is likely that the party's leader, David Trimble, who has become a courageous champion of the peace agreement, will keep his job for the present, the party's council will probably pass resolutions that would sabotage the peace agreement by pulling the party out of the process soon.</p>
        <p>The Protestants are angry that legislation now pending before the British House of Lords would change the name of Northern Ireland's police force from the Royal Ulster Constabulary to the more neutral Police Service of Northern Ireland for operational purposes. Although both names would appear on the organization's title deed, Protestants feel that the bill would airbrush the R.U.C. from history.</p>

        <p>Peace in Northern Ireland is once again precarious. Support for the Good Friday peace agreement signed in 1998 has dropped dangerously among Protestants, mainly over the issues of a new name for Northern Ireland's police and the Irish Republican Army's reluctance to give up its weapons. Later this month the council of the Ulster Unionist Party, the major Protestant party in the peace agreement, will meet. While it is likely that the party's leader, David Trimble, who has become a courageous champion of the peace agreement, will keep his job for the present, the party's council will probably pass resolutions that would sabotage the peace agreement by pulling the party out of the process soon.</p>
        <p>The Protestants are angry that legislation now pending before the British House of Lords would change the name of Northern Ireland's police force from the Royal Ulster Constabulary to the more neutral Police Service of Northern Ireland for operational purposes. Although both names would appear on the organization's title deed, Protestants feel that the bill would airbrush the R.U.C. from history.</p>
        <p>The police organization is particularly crucial to Protestants because it is the most important institutional expression of the Britishness of Northern Ireland that they long to hold onto. More than the name is at issue. The Good Friday agreement committed Protestants to sharing power with Catholics, on the police force and in other bodies, and as it has been carried out, Protestants' power has been eroded in favor of more representative government.</p>
        <p>This was desirable and inevitable. What Protestants opposed to the agreement have failed to notice is that these concessions are designed to buy something valuable: long-term peace. The R.U.C. is more than 90 percent Protestant, and is viewed by many Catholics as an occupying force. The pending police bill seeks to turn it into a service that Catholics will join -- a necessary foundation for peace. The police reform bill's modest changes have not gone far enough to win the support of the moderate Catholic party. It does not, for example, investigate the R.U.C.'s past abuses and weed out guilty officers. It should not be watered down further.</p>
        <p>The I.R.A., for its part, must take steps to help  Protestants understand what they can win by sharing power. The most important step is disarmament. The I.R.A. has always refused to turn over its weapons. After a long battle, it grudgingly opened the arms caches to international inspection, but so far the I.R.A. has allowed only one inspection and has not fully cooperated with the disarmament commission established by the peace process. A real embrace of disarmament would go a long way toward winning the trust of Protestants and keeping the peace agreement alive.</p>
