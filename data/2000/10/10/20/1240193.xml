        <p>It is a curtain call revelation that there are four cast members in ''Maquina Hamlet.'' You might think there are more of them. But until they take their somber bows, the actors have been hard to keep track of, performing as they do without speaking and often wearing rat-head masks among mannequins who are often in similar masks.</p>
        <p>As a mystery cleared up it isn't much, but after watching this hourlong play -- a fragmented, willfully obfuscatory, horrifically imagistic and aggressively disturbing work about power and cruelty and the presumptuousness of storytelling -- you're glad to have a firm and simple reality to hold onto.</p>

        <p>It is a curtain call revelation that there are four cast members in ''Maquina Hamlet.'' You might think there are more of them. But until they take their somber bows, the actors have been hard to keep track of, performing as they do without speaking and often wearing rat-head masks among mannequins who are often in similar masks.</p>
        <p>As a mystery cleared up it isn't much, but after watching this hourlong play -- a fragmented, willfully obfuscatory, horrifically imagistic and aggressively disturbing work about power and cruelty and the presumptuousness of storytelling -- you're glad to have a firm and simple reality to hold onto.</p>
        <p>The show, which can be seen tonight and tomorrow at the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, is an adaptation, by the Argentine troupe El Periferico de Objetos, of ''Hamlet Machine,'' which itself is an adaptation of sorts of Shakespeare's tragedy by the East German provocateur playwright Heiner Muller, who died in 1995.</p>
        <p>The script is a mere eight pages contrived from disjointed literary citations and harshly poetic declamations. It divides itself into five scenes in which Hamlet (and a handful of alter egos, one of which is an actor playing Hamlet) and Ophelia are situated in modern circumstances rife with political and sexual violence. The spoken lines are disembodied, delivered in voice-over (in Spanish; the show has English supertitles) so their identification with the speaker is difficult if not purposely obscured.</p>
        <p>Muller wrote it, it seems, partly as an intellectual joke, a play about intellectuals whose introspection leaves them helpless, a play without a play's structure or even stage directions; the possibilities for staging are vast. But it is also brutally serious in its depiction of human cruelty as the mindless alternative to nuanced thinking. The playwright's grim, abrasive amusement is aimed equally at the fecklessness of conventional narrative and the appalling coldblooded exercise of tyranny.</p>
        <p>The directors of the Argentine production -- Ana Alvarado, Daniel Veronese and Emilio Garcia Wehbi -- have chosen not to embody the literal  text on the stage. Rather, the scenes -- macabre, surreal and often shocking in their brutality, alluding to repressive politics in Argentina and elsewhere -- merely depart from the spirit and select details of the script.</p>
        <p>With the actors visiting casual torment on one another and on a variety of mannequins, puppets and dolls lighted (by Alejandro Le Roux and Mariano Dobrysz) to often chilling effect, and accompanied by an original score (by Cecilia Candia) that is ominous enough all by itself to make your hair stand up, the scenes cascade over the audience like a shower of glass shards. In one, an ugly depiction of mutual seduction, Ophelia (Felicitas Luna), wearing a red dress and crouching in a box that is half the size of a phone booth, is approached by three Hamlets (Jorge Onofri, Alejandro Tantanian and Mr. Wehbi). All are wearing rat masks, contortedly hunched over and grunting like animals; it's meant to be terrifying and funny, and it is, especially when it turns out the Hamlets are seeking only to light Ophelia's cigarette.</p>
        <p>In another, a cafe scene with mannequins seated at tables, rat-masked men dance with hermaphroditically dressed mannequins, also in masks and mounted on rollers; as they dance, the actors roughly seize their partners' sexual parts, slap their faces, beat them, hurl them to the floor. In a third, an audience of mannequins watches as men hurl darts into the back of a bound prisoner; then, as the mannequins stare at photographs of atrocities projected on the back wall of the stage, one at a time they are lifted from their chairs and savagely beaten. A child, in the form of a doll, has a sword thrust between its legs; a tiny naked headless female doll is bent over and shot with a pistol. Large dolls are manipulated to stomp on smaller ones.</p>
        <p>It's stomach-churning stuff, all the more distressing for the unavailability of any storytelling convention. The applause for the actors in the end is tinged with relief -- and eye-opening amazement that so few could wreak such havoc on so many.</p>
