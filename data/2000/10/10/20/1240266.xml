        <p>Congressional support is growing for efforts to require schools and libraries with Internet access to install software to block access to pornography, obscenity and materials considered harmful to minors.</p>
        <p>Provisions of an appropriations bill expected to be approved in the next few days would make filtering software a condition for grants under the E-rate program, which subsidizes Internet connections for schools and libraries. Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, in their debate this week, also spoke approvingly of such filters.</p>
        <p>Yet a commission appointed by Congress to study protecting children online has pointedly declined to recommend mandatory filtering. The Child Online Protection Act Commission, created by Congress in a 1998 Internet pornography bill, will issue a report today that calls instead for educating parents about the problem and enforcing existing obscenity laws.</p>
        <p>''We looked at mandatory filtering'' and unanimously rejected it, said Donald Telage, chairman of the commission and an executive of Network Solutions, the company that manages many Internet functions.</p>
        <p>The group, which included anti-pornography activists like Donna Rice Hughes of the advocacy group Protectkids.com, declined to support mandatory filtering because the technology was not yet good enough to block only the materials users want blocked, Mr. Telage said. He said the commission received evidence that even the most popular filtering products blocked innocuous sites and allowed adult materials to slip through.</p>
        <p>The timing of the filtering bill drew criticism from Alan Davidson of the Center for Democracy and Technology, which took part in the commission's work.</p>
        <p>''For Congress to be charging ahead even before it sees the report of the commission it created calls into question whether this legislation is really about protecting kids effectively,'' Mr. Davidson said.</p>
        <p>The legislation is drawn from proposals by three Republicans, Senators John McCain of Arizona and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Representative Ernest Istook of Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>Under the E-rate program, some $4 billion has been distributed to schools and libraries over the last three years, subsidized by a fee on long-distance phone bills.</p>
        <p>The White House is watching the appropriations bill closely, and a spokesman expressed reservations about mandates for filtering. ''The administration strongly supports efforts to ensure that schools and libraries protect minors from inappropriate materials,'' said the spokesman, Elliot Diringer. ''However, we do not believe that the federal government should mandate a particular type of technology, particularly since the technology is evolving so quickly.''</p>
        <p>The administration would support a bill that required schools and libraries accepting E-rate grants to develop their own Internet-use plans, Mr. Diringer said. But the filtering provision is such a small part of the huge appropriations bill for the Labor, Education and Health and Human Services Departments that its presence alone is unlikely to draw a presidential veto.</p>
        <p>Arguing for the legislation, Senator McCain said it would benefit communities by putting control of Internet use in their hands. Deciding what to block ''is only up to the school board and the library board,'' he said. ''It's not up to anybody else.''</p>
        <p>Public support is high for software solutions to the problems presented by Internet pornography. In a survey released this week by the Digital Media Forum, a media policy consortium established by the Ford Foundation, 92 percent of those surveyed said schools should filter out Internet pornography on student computers and 79 percent said schools should filter out hate speech.</p>
        <p>But librarians worry that the software will limit access to information, said Emily Sheketoff, executive director of the Washington office of the American Library Association. ''A filter is a machine,'' Ms. Sheketoff said. ''It is not a human being with sensibilities and judgments.''</p>
