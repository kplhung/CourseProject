        <p>Mike Hampton hits and acts like an everyday player, right down to his attitude about watching games from the bench. He hates it -- ''I pull my hair out,'' the Mets left-hander said -- but one of the few things he enjoys is watching Al Leiter bat. Hampton hit .274 this year, Leiter .053.</p>
        <p>''It lightens the mood,'' Hampton said. ''I know he gets upset; he just can't hit. You throw your bat out there enough times, you might hit it. He's got the body going in the right direction, toward first, but the bat just kind of stays where it started.''</p>

        <p>Mike Hampton hits and acts like an everyday player, right down to his attitude about watching games from the bench. He hates it -- ''I pull my hair out,'' the Mets left-hander said -- but one of the few things he enjoys is watching Al Leiter bat. Hampton hit .274 this year, Leiter .053.</p>
        <p>''It lightens the mood,'' Hampton said. ''I know he gets upset; he just can't hit. You throw your bat out there enough times, you might hit it. He's got the body going in the right direction, toward first, but the bat just kind of stays where it started.''</p>
        <p>Leiter does not dispute that. ''But, I'm the only one in here with one World Series hit,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The banter about batting put a light spin on a surprising decision that was announced yesterday by Mets Manager Bobby Valentine and the pitching coach, Dave Wallace. Hampton, who started Game 1 in each of the Mets' first two playoff rounds, will start the second game of the World Series against the Yankees on Sunday at Yankee Stadium. Leiter, who has followed Hampton in the rotation so far, will pitch Game 1.</p>
        <p>Hampton had expected to start on Saturday because it would allow him enough rest to pitch a possible Game 5 next Thursday at Shea Stadium, where he would be able to bat. General Manager Steve Phillips had said that could be a factor in the decision, but it turned out to be a minimal consideration.</p>
        <p>''If we have to rely on Mike to hit -- I rely on him to pitch,'' Wallace said.</p>
        <p>After Wednesday's workout, Hampton and Leiter pulled Valentine aside and asked him in the trainer's room if he had made a decision. Valentine told them that Leiter has followed Hampton all year; because Hampton started the Mets' last game, on Monday, Leiter should naturally pitch next.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Right on,' '' Hampton said.</p>
        <p>Leiter has not earned a victory in nine career postseason starts, but his teams have gone 6-3. He won Game 1 of the 1993 World Series as a reliever for Toronto; three games later, he singled using the bat of his teammate Ed Sprague.</p>
        <p>''It's an honor to get the first start in the World Series,'' Leiter said. ''It's something that means a lot. It's important. But beyond that, I think it's just as important for the other game starters to be excited about pitching Games 2, 3 and 4.''</p>
        <p>After Leiter and Hampton, Rick Reed will start Game 3 at Shea and Bobby J. Jones will start Game 4. Glendon Rusch, the Mets' fifth starter during the regular season, will remain in the bullpen, but the final roster is still undecided because Dennis Cook has a kidney stone that concerns Valentine.</p>
        <p>''That's why we're going to wait until the last minute and second,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Hampton earned most valuable player honors in the National League Championship Series by beating St. Louis twice and allowing no runs over 16 innings. Valentine said that if the Mets had lost Game 5 of the N.L.C.S., Leiter would have pitched the sixth game and been unavailable to start Game 1 of the World Series.</p>
        <p>''I believe in my heart that Mike understands this is not a demotion,'' Valentine said. ''If he had not won, Al would have ended up pitching the next game, and this would have been a moot point.''</p>
        <p>In his complete-game victory over the Cardinals on Monday, Hampton threw 120 pitches, a total he exceeded only once after the All-Star Game break. By pitching on Sunday, he will have a fifth day to rest. Leiter, who has not pitched since Game 2 in St. Louis last Thursday, will have eight days of rest instead of nine.</p>
        <p>''It actually worked out good,'' Wallace said. ''Al doesn't have too much time off, and Mike has an extra day.''</p>
        <p>While not saying he needed the extra rest, Hampton essentially agreed. ''I threw 120 pitches, so it definitely couldn't hurt,'' he said. ''In a situation like that, you're strong anyway just because of the magnitude of the game.''</p>
        <p>Leiter, who grew up on the Jersey Shore, rooted for the Mets and was drafted by the Yankees, said it was never his dream to start the first game of the Subway Series. As a kid, he said, he wanted to pitch the seventh game, and he did that for the Florida Marlins in 1997.</p>
        <p>Leiter got a no-decision that night, but he pitched well and the Marlins beat Cleveland in extra innings.</p>
        <p>''Al's been in that situation before,'' said Cook, a teammate with Florida in '97. ''He's not going to be bothered by the crowds or the pressure or the situation. In fact, I think he thrives on that kind of stuff, he feeds off it. He'll be excited and ready to pitch.''</p>
        <p>Leiter has pitched twice this postseason, allowing 5 runs in 15 innings and building on his reputation as a big-game pitcher. ''I think the last handful of situations the last few years, for some reason I've been able to internalize a lot of things and focus on what really matters,'' Leiter said. ''It sounds so simple, but what keeps a player from doing the best he can and nailing his performance is he's mentally out of it.</p>
        <p>''It's easy to be mentally out of a baseball game based on exterior distractions. And obviously here in the World Series, Game 1, it's exciting, there's all the pageantry, the singing, the production and all that.</p>
        <p>''If you're able to eliminate all that, the fan distractions and the media hype, and really focus on 'How do I get Knoblauch out?' and 'How am I going to pitch to Jeter?' your whole mindset is your game plan. As long as you can continue to think that way, you'll do all right.''</p>
