      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Eli Lilly &amp; Company said yesterday that it had terminated its agreement with Sepracor, a small drug company, to make a new version of the antidepressant drug Prozac after some patients taking the new formulation in clinical trials developed abnormal heart rhythms.</p>
        <p>The news sent Sepracor's stock down $33.75, or almost 30 percent, to $87.06. Lilly fell 75 cents, to $88.50.</p>
        <p>Sepracor, which is based in Marlborough, Mass., had estimated that it would earn tens of millions of dollars a year in royalty income from the new antidepressant once regulators approved it.</p>
        <p>''That goes away,'' said Timothy J. Barberich, Sepracor's chief executive. ''There is no way to sugarcoat the fact that that simply disappears.''</p>
        <p>The drug, which is known as R-fluoxetine, was expected to be the improved Prozac and represented one of several strategies that Lilly  had planned to try to fill in for sales it expects to lose when the Prozac patent protection expires next August. Last year, Prozac, at $2.1 billion, accounted for more than 20 percent of Lilly's sales.</p>
        <p>To make up for the anticipated loss, Lilly is also working on a once-a-week Prozac pill and another drug that is a combination of Prozac and Zyprexa, a drug used by patients with schizophrenia. Earlier this year, Lilly also began selling Serafem, a drug of the same chemical as Prozac, for women with menstrual problems.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Lilly said that it would also significantly increase its efforts to develop duloxetine, another antidepressant.</p>
        <p>As for Sepracor, Mr. Barberich said the company hoped to replace the expected income from R-fluoxetine with sales of other drugs that the company is developing, including an improved version of Claritin, the allergy drug sold by Schering-Plough.</p>
        <p>But the news shows that Sepracor's business may be more risky than some investors and Wall Street analysts had thought. Sepracor is trying to minimize the risk and expense of developing drugs by taking other companies' blockbuster products and improving them so that they have fewer side effects.</p>
        <p>To improve drugs, Sepracor developed a technology that exploits the century-old discovery that most chemicals are formed with two mirror-image compounds, or isomers. For most drugs, only one side of the pair is active, and the other may cause side effects. By eliminating the problematic isomer, Sepracor hopes to develop safer drugs.</p>
        <p>The approach worked in the case of Allegra, the allergy drug sold by Aventis. Sepracor developed Allegra by taking an older drug, Seldane, and improving it.</p>
        <p>Neil B. Sweig, an analyst at Ryan, Beck &amp; Company, said the plunge in Sepracor's stock price showed what can happen to small biotechnology companies that depend on one or two products or agreements with large drug companies. ''This has been devastating to Sepracor,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Separately, Lilly reported that its third-quarter profit increased 15 percent, in line with analysts' estimates. Net income was $778.8 million, or 71 cents a share, compared with profit from operations of $679.7 million, or 62 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 9 percent, to $2.81 billion from $2.59 billion.</p>
        <p>Bristol-Myers Squibb and American Home Products also reported earnings yesterday.</p>
        <p>Bristol-Myers said that its third-quarter net income rose 13 percent, to $1.24 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.1 billion, or 54 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 5 percent, to $5.3 billion from $5.04 billion. The results beat Wall Street forecasts by a penny a share.</p>
        <p>At American Home, third-quarter profit from operations increased 18 percent, to $762.1 million, or 58 cents a share, from $645.1 million, or 49 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 13 percent, to $3.68 billion from $3.26 billion. The results matched analysts' estimates.</p>
