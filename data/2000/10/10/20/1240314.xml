        <p>Re ''A Senseless Health Deduction'' (editorial, Oct. 14):</p>
        <p>For two years, the American Medical Association has strongly supported using refundable tax credits to expand health insurance coverage to the uninsured.</p>
        <p>Simulations conducted by our Center for Health Policy Research show that providing lower-income individuals with tax credits large enough to cover all or most of their health insurance premiums, combined with increased enrollment of those eligible for Medicaid and the state Children's Health Insurance Program, will get us very close to providing health care coverage for all Americans.</p>
        <p>Several bipartisan bills have focused on tax credits to expand coverage. We are committed to working with the sponsors of these bills and other lawmakers to make universal coverage a reality in the next Congress.</p>
