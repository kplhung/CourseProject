        <p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has narrowed the number of bidders for the World Trade Center to Brookfield Financial Properties, Silverstein Properties, Vornado Realty Trust and Boston Properties, according to state officials and real estate executives. Last month, the Port Authority accepted eight bids, ranging up to $3 billion, for a 99-year lease of the 11 million- square-foot complex. Analysts said the actual value of the offers would probably be $500 million less, because the city insisted after the bids were submitted that the new owners would have to pay full property taxes, rather than the reduced $25 million annual payment the Port Authority makes. Among the losing bidders  was Tishman Speyer Properties.</p>
