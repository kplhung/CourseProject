        <p>As ''The Yards'' grimly wends its way toward a sudden surprise ending that's corny enough to cap a 1940's Warner Brothers crime story, it is impossible not to admire the film's epic ambitions, thwarted though they may be by the final spasm of nobility. But until that moment, ''The Yards,'' directed by James Gray (''Little Odessa''), impresses as one of the few films in recent years to dare to tread in the sacred shadow of Francis Ford Coppola's ''Godfather'' movies. For that kind of nerve, it deserves points.</p>
        <p>With its candlelit chiaroscuro, its hushed family pow-wows, and a dark, churning score by Howard Shore that consciously echoes Nino Rota's and Carmine Coppola's original music for ''The Godfather,'' ''The Yards'' aspires to the same towering evocation of a shadow world within the one we know.</p>
        <p>James Caan, the original Sonny Corleone, is conveniently on hand to infuse ''The Yards'' with his smiling-cobra charm as Frank Olchin, the corrupt captain of a hugely profitable business repairing New York subway cars. Frank, who has grown rich and arrogant from a bribery and kickback scheme that involves the Queens borough president (Steve Lawrence), lives in a mansion whose interiors are bathed in the same eternal dusk that dimly glows inside the Mafia castles of ''The Godfather.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Coppola's classic films aren't the only obvious forerunners of ''The Yards.'' Often the movie recalls Sidney Lumet's gritty New York dramas of the 1970's and 80's. Some of its punchiest scenes show politicians, labor organizers, businessmen and policemen thrashing out issues and haggling for pieces of the pie. As these men in their cheap suits and bad dye jobs jockey for advantage, ''The Yards'' portrays New York City politics as a sweaty back-room world of shady deals and mutual back-scratching. If that world feels authentic, it also seems slightly out of date in these yuppified times.</p>
        <p>Finally, there are those sentimental old-time prison movies that ''The Yards'' updates with its Coppola and Lumet-influenced touches. According to the formula, a good-hearted ex-convict back on the streets and determined to go straight finds himself led astray along a path from which there is no turning back. The only cliche missing is a concerned streetwise priest.</p>
        <p>The dirty-faced angel suckered back into the criminal life in ''The Yards'' is Leo Handler (Mark Wahlberg), a street kid who served his time after taking the fall for a group of friends involved in an auto theft ring. Earnestly played by Mr. Wahlberg, who speaks his role in a near-whisper, he is a chip off James Cagney's block. As Leo endures one personal disaster after another, you know he will end up either a martyr or a hero, and you root for him to be saved by a miracle.</p>
        <p>In old-time Hollywood style, ''The Yards'' also gives Leo a long-suffering, physically fragile mother of the sort that the Cagney character would call ''Ma,'' as in ''Aw, Ma!'' Val (Ellen Burstyn) who has been living for her son's return, is the kind of doting but perpetually weepy mother whose heart condition dramatically improves or worsens depending on the fortunes of her fugitive boy.</p>
        <p>Val also happens to be the sister of Frank's wife, Kitty (Faye Dunaway). No sooner has Leo returned from prison than he has a job interview with Frank, who promises him low-level work as a repairman once he completes the requisite training. Leo, who is less than enthusiastic about such prospects, wonders how his best friend, Willie Gutierrez (Joaquin Phoenix), who also works for Frank, has money to burn.</p>
        <p>He soon finds out. When Willie takes him along on his rounds collecting payoffs for Frank, he invites Leo to be a partner. Leo can't resist the easy money. One night, Willie invites Frank to accompany him to the Queens subway yards, where trouble breaks out between competing contractors. In panic, Willie commits a murder, while Leo nearly kills  a policemen who tries to prevent him from fleeing.</p>
        <p>As the incident balloons into a scandal that threatens Frank's business, Leo goes into hiding and finds himself gradually cut off and eventually named the chief suspect in the  killing. Adding emotional complications is Willie's engagement to Frank's beautiful stepdaughter (and Leo's cousin), Erica Soltz (Charlize Theron), who was Leo's teenage sweetheart.</p>
        <p>''The Yards'' is held together with so many narrative nuts and bolts it sometimes feels clogged with machinery, and as the story unfolds, the screenplay frantically tries to sketch in crucial details with little bursts of exposition. That rush to fill in the blanks takes its toll. And when ''The Yards'' builds to a moment of Greek tragedy near the end, it feels more  forced than cathartic.</p>
        <p>But for all its incongruities, ''The Yards'' is a serious film that strives for a moral complexity and a textural density rarely found in contemporary dramas. Its greatest asset is Mr. Phoenix's incendiary Willie. Hot-wired with ambition, every nerve twitching with impatience, his eyes ablaze, he is the personification of upward mobility run amok, an impassioned young man so desperately on the make he could explode at any second.</p>
        <p>''The Yards'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of violence and profanity.</p>
        <p>THE YARDS  Written and directed by James Gray; director of photography, Harris Savides; edited by Jeff Ford; production designer, Kevin Thompson; produced by Paul Webster, Nick Wechsler and Kerry Orent; released by Miramax Films. Running time: 115 minutes. This film is rated R.</p>
        <p>WITH: Mark Wahlberg (Leo Handler), Charlize Theron (Erica Soltz), Joaquin Phoenix (Willie Gutierrez), James Caan (Frank Olchin), Ellen Burstyn (Val Handler) and Faye Dunaway (Kitty Olchin).</p>
