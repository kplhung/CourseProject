        <p>Wim Duisenberg, the gruff and blunt-speaking president of the European Central Bank, admitted today that he had blundered in his recent comments and vowed to hold his tongue more in the future.</p>
        <p>With the euro sinking this week to a new record low against the dollar, Mr. Duisenberg has been criticized as never before for saying things that in easier circumstances might have been quickly forgotten. But these are not easier circumstances. These are times when nothing seems to go right for the euro, the 11-nation common currency, and many are looking for someone to blame.</p>
        <p>Since its introduction at the beginning of 1999, the euro has lost more than one-quarter of its value against the dollar. Originally envisioned with pride as a rival to the dollar, the euro has become a frustrating symbol of Europe's inability to keep pace with American growth and investment.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Duisenberg whipped up a new storm this week, suggesting in an interview with The Times of London that the European Central Bank would not intervene again soon to strengthen the euro.</p>
        <p>He also acknowledged that he had tried and failed to persuade Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers to soften his calls for a strong dollar when the United States participated in a coordinated purchase of euros last month. In doing so, Mr. Duisenberg seemed to be suggesting that American support for more such interventions was unlikely in the near future.</p>
        <p>The comments led to another sell-off of the euro and raised questions on the steadiness of his leadership.</p>
        <p>Less than a year after the euro's debut, Mr. Duisenberg said the central bank practiced ''benign neglect'' when it came to exchange rates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duisenberg swallowed those words soon afterward. After the euro plunged below parity with the dollar, he began emphasizing a growing concern about the exchange rate. A month ago, when central banks intervened in the currency markets to defend the euro, Mr. Duisenberg said he wanted to see an ''orderly reversal'' of the euro's sharp decline over the preceding 20 months.</p>
        <p>But instead of a reversal, the euro climbed only a few cents and then began to slip back toward its pre-intervention low of 84.38 cents. And despite central bankers' vague warnings of more interventions, there were none. On Monday, after his comments appeared in the Times of London, the euro slipped to less than a penny of its previous low and on Wednesday it sank to a new bottom of 83.76 cents. Today, the euro rebounded a little, settling in New York at 84.37 cents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duisenberg conceded today that he had slipped. ''I do realize that some of my recent remarks gave rise to critical comments, and certainly they gave rise to a lot of advice,'' he said at a news conference in Paris, after a meeting of the central bank's board of governors. ''I draw my conclusions and I accept the advice and that is, I'm not going to answer any questions related to that recent interview and any questions related to interventions.''</p>
        <p>Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the French central bank, who is expected to succeed Mr. Duisenberg in a year or two, insisted at the same news conference that Mr. Duisenberg had the full support of each country in the euro zone.</p>
        <p>Newspapers have been much less forgiving. The Munich daily Suddeutsche Zeitung accused Mr. Duisenberg of having committed the ''banker's mortal sin'' in talking about intervention plans. The French newspaper Liberation called him the ''euro-dolt.''</p>
