        <p>After watching the three presidential debates, several prominent Democrats on Capitol Hill bluntly questioned Gov. George W. Bush's capacity to lead yesterday, reinforcing a theme that surrogates for Vice President Al Gore plan to voice repeatedly in the final days of the campaign.</p>
        <p>''The governor is a high-risk choice,'' said Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska in a telephone interview. ''I've got concerns about whether or not he's up to the job.''</p>

        <p>After watching the three presidential debates, several prominent Democrats on Capitol Hill bluntly questioned Gov. George W. Bush's capacity to lead yesterday, reinforcing a theme that surrogates for Vice President Al Gore plan to voice repeatedly in the final days of the campaign.</p>
        <p>''The governor is a high-risk choice,'' said Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska in a telephone interview. ''I've got concerns about whether or not he's up to the job.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton joined in the criticism yesterday, though he restricted his comments to a contention by Mr. Bush in Tuesday's debate about a 1997 Texas law that allowed patients to sue health maintenance organizations for denying coverage. Mr. Bush took credit for that provision even though he initially opposed it, allowed the bill to become law without his signature and vetoed an earlier version of the legislation.</p>
        <p>''I almost gagged when I heard that answer on the patients' bill of rights in Texas,'' Mr. Clinton said while meeting with House and Senate Democrats in the Cannon House Office Building. ''Could you believe that? Here's a guy who takes credit for a bill that he vetoed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said the Bush campaign was trying to deceive voters about Republican positions on the issues. ''As hard as we try to bring clarity,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''they're really good at clouding up.''</p>
        <p>The comments by Mr. Kerrey and other lawmakers came a day after Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, William M. Daley, visited Capitol Hill to meet with Congressional leaders. Several senators told Mr. Daley that the debates had convinced them that an effective political argument should be made against Mr. Bush's capacity for presidential leadership, and Mr. Daley encouraged them to make it, officials in Congress and the Gore campaign said.</p>
        <p>The campaign has tried to make that case in recent weeks through its spokesmen. One of them, Chris Lehane, said last week that Mr. Bush would be ''held to presidential standards when it comes to describing his policy views,'' and asserted that ''thus far he has not met the Quayle standard,'' a reference to former Vice President Dan Quayle.</p>
        <p>Steve Elmendorf, the chief of staff to Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, said leaders in each house would question Mr. Bush's leadership in news conferences, floor speeches and media interviews. ''As people have watched these debates, they have come in with a real sense that this is something we've got to talk about,'' Mr. Elmendorf said.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Elmendorf said House members would not question Mr. Bush's intellect. ''Being president requires a lot more than brains,'' Mr. Elmendorf said. ''But particularly when you put him up against Gore, you can question his experience and ability to lead.''</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, characterized such comments as ''echoes of former Gov. Ann Richards,'' who was defeated by Mr. Bush in 1994 after a campaign in which she regularly belittled him.</p>
        <p>''The governor is very proud of how he has brought people together in a bipartisan way to lead and get things done in Texas,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''I do want to say that the worse Al Gore does in the polls, the more he and his surrogates are going on the attack, and the more they go on the attack, the worse Al Gore will do in the polls.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerrey, who is retiring from the Senate early next year to become president of the New School University in New York, said in the interview that ''competency is an issue and there are serious questions about Governor Bush.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''When I hear him answer a question about the Middle East, I don't hear experience talking. I hear: 'I was a governor. I've got a vision. And I stick with my friends.'''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerrey said he was particularly concerned about Mr. Bush's ability to handle complicated trade, defense and foreign policy matters. ''Many of the answers in the debate indicated to me that on foreign policy and defense issues he's going to have to contract out to get other people to advise him,'' Mr. Kerrey said.</p>
        <p>Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, also speaking in a telephone interview, made a similar point by noting the complexity of the annual negotiations over appropriations bills. ''I read where Governor Bush doesn't like meetings of more than 15 minutes and one sheet of paper kind of things,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''These negotiations get so complex that the president really needs to know the details.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leahy added: ''It isn't simply saying I work with Democrats and Republicans in a statehouse where the governor has very little authority anyway. This is a much different thing, and at least listening to him in the debates he seems to have an aversion not only to the details but to policy making as well.''</p>
        <p>He said that if Mr. Bush wanted to demonstrate his leadership abilities he should, as the leader of his party, instruct Senate Republicans to vote on federal judgeships for a number of women and minorities that have been held up in that chamber.</p>
        <p>In the same vein, Mr. Gephardt, speaking in the same Congressional leadership meeting as Mr. Clinton, challenged Mr. Bush to lobby House Republicans to approve the president's request for money to hire teachers and build new schools.</p>
        <p>''Let's test those skills you claim to have honed so well in the Texas Legislature,'' Mr. Gephardt said.</p>
