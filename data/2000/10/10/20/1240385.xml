        <p>FRASER-Ann Brewer, 98, surrounded by family, died peacefully on Sunday, October 15th in her beloved cabin in Newcomb, NY. She was married to George E. Brewer, Jr. for 45 years and is survived by her daughters, Effie Kimball, Ann Knox, her daughter-in-law Charlotte Brewer, 13 grandchildren and 20 great-granchildren. Her sons, Michael and George Fraser, predeceased her. Born in NYC, she attended the Brearley School and graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1923. During World War II, while her husband was overseas, she served with the Red Cross and took in a war-displaced English family of five. She was Chairman of the Board of the New York School of Social Work at Columbia University and served on the boards of St. Faith's Home, Tarrytown, NY and Camphill Village, Copake, NY. A long-time resident of NYC, she was a member of the Cosmopolitan Club. In 1990 she moved to Collington, a retirement community near Washington, DC. There will be a service in Newcomb on October 21 and a later memorial service at Collington, MD. In lieu of flowers, contributions to the Ann Brewer Memorial at the Student Conservation Association, PO Box 550, Charlestown, NH 03603.</p>
