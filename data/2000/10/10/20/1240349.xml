        <p>With the Democrats running new commercials attacking his Social Security plan, Gov. George W. Bush struck back hard yesterday, contending that Vice President Al Gore was pitting ''grandparents against grandchildren'' for political gain.</p>
        <p>Campaigning at a tool factory outside Detroit, Mr. Bush said Mr. Gore ''leads the party of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but the only thing he has to offer is fear itself.'' In a speech laced with some of his strongest broadsides in the campaign so far, he went on to accuse the vice president of being irresponsible and not facing up to the fiscal problems that Social Security will encounter in coming years.</p>
        <p>''A true leader does not try to pit grandparents against grandchildren,'' Mr. Bush told the cheering crowd in Macomb County, the home of the so-called Reagan Democrat. ''A true leader will fix this problem so that both the 'Greatest Generation' and the rising generation can depend on the promise of Social Security.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush wrapped the mantle of Roosevelt around his own plan to divert some of the Social Security payroll tax to private investment accounts for younger workers. He called his proposal a ''New Deal for a new generation.''</p>
        <p>The speech amounted to one of Mr. Bush's most sustained defenses of his Social Security plan since he unveiled it last May. He also spoke more broadly of the high-technology, investor-driven ''new economy,'' portraying himself as an advocate of an entrepreneurial future and Mr. Gore as a relic the ''planners and bureaucrats'' of the past.</p>
        <p>The Republican presidential nominee gave a spirited defense of Texas as a mecca of the high-technology industry, painting a picture of his state at odds with Mr. Gore's portrayals of it as a smog-ridden place where children lack health insurance coverage.</p>
        <p>''We are attracting young, ambitious workers from all across America,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>But at the heart of Mr. Bush's  address was his proposal for Social Security. On Wednesday the Democrats, moving fast to take advantage of one of the exchanges in the third and last presidential debate, began broadcasting a commercial about Social Security.</p>
        <p>Asking ''which promise is he going to break?'' the advertisement echoes the language Mr. Gore used when he raised Social Security in the last moments of the debate.</p>
        <p>''He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security trust fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own,'' Mr. Gore said in the debate, referring to Mr. Bush. ''But he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he's promised the same trillion dollars to them. So this is the Show Me State, reminds me of the line from the movie, 'Show me the money.' Which one of those promises will you keep and which will you break, governor?''</p>
        <p>The Democratic criticisms were based on the fact that Mr. Bush has put out the framework of a Social Security plan but not details, saying he wants flexibility to negotiate with Congress.</p>
        <p>Analysts say that the transition from the current system to the kind proposed by Mr. Bush will require some hard choices. Under the Social Security system the payroll taxes of current workers are now used to pay current retirees. So if part of those taxes are shifted into private accounts, a way has to be found to keep paying current retirees.</p>
        <p>Many experts estimate the cost of such a transition at nearly $1 trillion and say those funds would have to be accounted for through reductions in guaranteed benefits or a temporary infusion of cash into the trust fund.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not provide more details yesterday, but instead ridiculed Mr. Gore's math, saying, ''My opponent, a man prone to exaggeration at times, seems to be deliberately missing a trillion dollars. Maybe if you've been in Washington too long you lose your ability to count real money.''</p>
        <p>He insisted that the Social Security system, which is projected to run a $2.4 trillion surplus over the next 10 years, would have ''more than enough money to pay all the benefits it owes America's grandparents while allowing grandchildren to open personal accounts within the Social Security system.'' And he predicted that personal accounts, invested in the stock market, would ''grow to $3 trillion by the year 2016, helping save Social Security for the future and building wealth for a new generation of Americans.''</p>
        <p>To give his advocacy of private accounts the sheen of bipartisanship, Mr. Bush invoked two Democratic senators who favor such an approach -- Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Both men are leaving Congress at the end of this session.</p>
        <p>''With this Social Security reform, over time the working class will join the investor class,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Millions of Americans -- of every race and age and background -- will have not only wages, but accumulated wealth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush found other ways to go after Mr. Gore, winning the applause of his audience. He noted that a Texan, Jack S. Kilby, had just won the Nobel Prize for inventing the integrated circuit in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>''It was an amazing achievement, unrivaled in the annals of technology -- until 1986 when one senator from Tennessee, alone in his office, invented the Internet,'' Mr. Bush said, mocking Mr. Gore's statement in 1999 that he had been instrumental in the creation of the Internet.</p>
        <p>In His Own Words</p>
        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH  Speaking yesterday in Macomb County, Mich.</p>
        <p>''Yesterday, the Democratic Party released its latest attack ad prepared by the Gore media team and designed to scare seniors. The chairman said that I had grabbed the third rail of American politics, and ''he just didn't realize that we hadn't switched on the electricity yet and that's what we're going to do with this television ad as well.''</p>
        <p>Not this time. Not this year.</p>
        <p>It is irresponsible for the chairman of the Democratic Party and for Vice President Gore to stoke the fears of seniors while ignoring the hopes of  younger workers. A true leader does not try to pit grandparents against grandchildren; a true leader will fix this problem so that both the Greatest Generation and the Rising Generation can depend on the promise of Social Security.</p>
        <p>Now, my opponent, a man prone to exaggeration at times, seems to be deliberately missing a trillion dollars.</p>
        <p>Maybe if you've been in Washington too long you lose your ability to count real money. Independent analysts confirm, the Social Security system has a $2.4 trillion surplus over the next 10 years, more than enough money to pay all the benefits it owes America's grandparents while allowing grandchildren to open personal accounts within the Social Security system.</p>
        <p>The personal accounts will grow to $3 trillion by the year 2016, helping save Social Security for the future and building wealth for a new generation of Americans.</p>
        <p>Where we see a vision of hope, the Democrats will wage a campaign of fear. But this will not stop us from doing what is right.''</p>
