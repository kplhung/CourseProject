        <p>303 Gallery  525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea  Through Nov. 4</p>
        <p>In their last New York show two years ago, the young British twin-sister team Jane and Louise Wilson presented a mysterious and absorbing multiscreen video tour of Stasi City, the abandoned headquarters of the once terrifying East German secret service. Here they direct their haunting, ultraformalist vision to two other sites of post-Cold War resonance: Star City and the Baikonur cosmodrome, the first a training center for Russian cosmonauts, the latter the Russian space program's primary home.</p>

        <p>303 Gallery  525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea  Through Nov. 4</p>
        <p>In their last New York show two years ago, the young British twin-sister team Jane and Louise Wilson presented a mysterious and absorbing multiscreen video tour of Stasi City, the abandoned headquarters of the once terrifying East German secret service. Here they direct their haunting, ultraformalist vision to two other sites of post-Cold War resonance: Star City and the Baikonur cosmodrome, the first a training center for Russian cosmonauts, the latter the Russian space program's primary home.</p>
        <p>Four films are projected onto two pairs of wall-size screens set up in opposite corners of the gallery. Focusing mostly on architecture and high-tech equipment -- from mundane meeting rooms to a vast, zero-gravity training pool to giant rocket-launching towers -- the camera takes you on a virtual journey through places that seem at once futuristic and dilapidated, a mix of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ''Blade Runner.''</p>
        <p>All four screens tend to focus on the same subject matter at any given moment, but here the camera swoops up, there it slides down; here it approaches and enters, there it retreats. With its ominous accompaniment of ambient noises -- clanking, buzzing, whining and roaring -- the experience is mesmerizing, a walk-in, constantly evolving, Cubist hallucination.</p>
        <p>There is, of course, a moral or sociological perspective being urged here. Though the Russian space program is still active, it has evidently fallen on hard times. The overall sense of gloom and dereliction in the films expresses a poignant Romantic conviction that the great, all-conquering dreams of Modernity -- political as well as scientific -- have sadly failed.</p>
