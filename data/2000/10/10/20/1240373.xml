        <p>Uncharacteristic failures by the defending Stanley Cup champion Devils resulted in a 5-2 loss last night in Washington to a Capitals team that had gone without a victory in its first six games.</p>
        <p>The penalty killers and goalie Martin Brodeur, strengths of the Devils for years, were ineffective as New Jersey fell to 2-2-1.</p>
        <p>The penalty killers allowed goals on the Capitals' first two manpower advantages, and Brodeur was pulled by Coach Larry Robinson for the first time since April 15, 1998, after allowing four goals on 10 shots in just under 34 minutes.</p>
        <p>We didn't get the goaltending, and there were too many passengers that didn't want to pay the price, Robinson said.</p>
        <p>The most embarrassing moment, however, belonged to Chris Terreri, who took over for Brodeur. In his first appearance of the season, Terreri displayed his rustiness by letting the second shot he faced jump out of his glove for a goal.</p>
        <p>Turner Stevenson took two penalties in the opening period for the Devils, and Washington capitalized both times, exposing the Devils' weakness at killing penalties. They entered the game 28th in the league in that department.</p>
        <p>Steve Konowalchuk beat Brodeur just 22 seconds after the first penalty to Stevenson, which came at 3 minutes 14 seconds.</p>
        <p>The Devils' penalty killers looked even worse during the second penalty. They were pinned in their zone for a full minute, allowing several shots before Adam Oates scored with 1:55 left in the period.</p>
        <p>Sergei Nemchinov narrowed the gap with his second goal of the season just 1:11 after the first intermission.</p>
        <p>The Capitals, who had lost four games and tied two going into last night's game, awakened after Nemchinov's goal and extended their lead to four goals on scores by Oates at 7:43, Petr Bondra at 13:56 and Dmitri Mironov in the 16th minute.</p>
        <p>Brian Rafalski scored a power-play goal for the Devils with 6:47 left, the only goal in the last period.</p>
