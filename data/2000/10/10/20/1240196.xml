        <p>''Bedazzled'' is about a troubled young man, unhappy with his life and desperate for wealth, love and power, who signs away his immortal soul in exchange for everything he thinks he desires. Does this sound familiar?</p>
        <p>It's a story that has been recycled more frequently than ''A Star Is Born,'' and not only in Hollywood: it goes back at least to Christopher Marlowe's ''Tragical History of Dr. Faustus'' in the 16th century. Goethe's ''Faust,'' two centuries later, was, as they say in show business, a remake. Of course, ''Bedazzled'' has a more recent and less highbrow source: Stanley Donen's cheeky 1967 satire of the same name, which starred (and was written by) Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.</p>

        <p>''Bedazzled'' is about a troubled young man, unhappy with his life and desperate for wealth, love and power, who signs away his immortal soul in exchange for everything he thinks he desires. Does this sound familiar?</p>
        <p>It's a story that has been recycled more frequently than ''A Star Is Born,'' and not only in Hollywood: it goes back at least to Christopher Marlowe's ''Tragical History of Dr. Faustus'' in the 16th century. Goethe's ''Faust,'' two centuries later, was, as they say in show business, a remake. Of course, ''Bedazzled'' has a more recent and less highbrow source: Stanley Donen's cheeky 1967 satire of the same name, which starred (and was written by) Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.</p>
        <p>Harold Ramis, directing from a script he wrote with Peter Tolan and Larry Gelbart, has cleverly updated the earlier film, transporting the action from swinging London to yuppie San Francisco. In place of Mr. Moore's shy burger-flipper, Mr. Ramis's film stars Brendan Fraser as Elliot Richards, a socially maladjusted tech-support geek whose office mates go to great (and justifiable) lengths to avoid having anything to do with him.</p>
        <p>More than anything else, Elliot longs for the attention of a pretty co-worker named Alison (Frances O'Connor), who doesn't even know he exists. In the middle of a humiliating night out, Elliot encounters a seductress in a tight red dress (Elizabeth Hurley), who says she is the devil and has the business card to prove it. (It says ''The Devil'' in handsome type.) Soon she has packed him into her Lamborghini Diablo (get it?) and spirited him away to an after-hours club where she produces a fat contract. He'll be granted seven wishes, and she'll have, well, you know.</p>
        <p>What follows is outrageous fun. Elliot, wishing himself rich, powerful and married to Alison, is transformed into a Colombian drug lord. Mr. Fraser is a master of goofy befuddlement, and his face as he discovers himself speaking Spanish is almost worth the price of the ticket.</p>
        <p>The considerate princess of darkness has equipped Elliot with an enchanted pager that allows him to bail out if his wish isn't going well. And so he finds himself, after the narcotraficante gig doesn't work out, as a seven-and-a-half-foot-tall N.B.A. superstar, a famous author and the most sensitive man in the world (in a brutally funny parody of ''Dawson's Creek'').</p>
        <p>The physical transformations that Mr. Fraser undergoes in each scenario are impressive, but the real artistry is in his quick-change performance. He looks perpetually surprised at himself as he utters dumb-jock cliches, sings a song in praise of our friend the dolphin (complete with dolphin voices) and delivers nonsensical witticisms at a high-toned literary soiree.</p>
        <p>With his slightly pudgy face and his loose, ungainly physical presence, he manages to be both likable and ridiculous. Ms. Hurley struts through her role with insouciant glee; her performance is a sneaky tribute to Mr. Cook's arch English naughtiness, even as her get-up recalls Raquel Welch's cameo in the original film as the incarnation of lust.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramis, a reliable purveyor of pleasant comedy -- and the author of one indisputably great movie, ''Groundhog Day'' -- offers a streamlined refashioning of the raffish anarchy that made the first ''Bedazzled'' a product of its place and time. He brings off big blunt effects, like Mr. Fraser's crashing onto the hood of a car or shattering a backboard with clean efficiency, and keeps the momentum going with offhand witty jokes and sight gags. In an especially clever touch, he uses the same actors who play Elliot's co-workers as comic foils in the wish sequences -- a kind of infernal homage to ''The Wizard of Oz.''</p>
        <p>The old ''Bedazzled'' -- a worthwhile video rental whether or not you see the new version -- flirted, in its youthful, rebellious way, with blasphemy. Mr. Ramis, a man of his times, elects to embrace piety instead. ''Bedazzled'' ends with the usual affirmations of the need to work hard, to believe in yourself and to make your own way in the world.</p>
        <p>''Heaven and hell are right here on the earth. It's up to you to choose.'' It's a familiar Hollywood moral that  also happens to be one of the cornerstones of Western theology: the doctrine of free will. Who could wish for more?</p>
        <p>''Bedazzled'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some mildly off-color jokes and sexual references.</p>
