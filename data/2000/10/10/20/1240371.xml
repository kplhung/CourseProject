        <p>PENGUINS 3, SENATORS 3: Martin Straka scored with 22 seconds left in regulation to lift the Pittsburgh Penguins to a tie with Ottawa.</p>
        <p>Straka took a pass from Jaromir Jagr, after a failed clearing attempt by the Senators, and beat goalie Jani Hurme to complete the Penguins' comeback from a three-goal, third-period deficit.</p>
        <p>Jagr and Alexei Kovalev also scored for Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Rookie Martin Havlat, Magnus Arvedson and Alexei Yashin scored for Ottawa, which had its four-game winning streak stopped. The Senators (4-0-2) managed to set a franchise record for best start to a season, beating last year's mark of 4-1-1.</p>
        <p>CANADIENS 3, FLYERS 3: Oleg Petrov scored with 3:13 left in regulation as the Montreal Canadiens earned a tie with Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>The Flyers, an Eastern Conference finalist last year are winless in six games.</p>
        <p>Petrov skated from the right corner and fired the puck high over the glove side of Philadelphia goalie Roman Cechmanek.</p>
        <p>PREDATORS 2, RED WINGS 1, OT: Cliff Ronning's goal 1:51 into overtime gave the surprising Nashville Predators a victory over the Detroit Red Wings.</p>
        <p>Sergei Fedorov forced overtime when he scored Detroit's only goal with just 3.4 seconds left in regulation.</p>
        <p>But Ronning took advantage of a collision between Detroit goalie Manny Legace and defenseman Larry Murphy at the right of the Red Wings net and put a shot between Legace's glove and the right post.</p>
        <p>BLUES 7, KINGS 1: Roman Turek stopped 17 shots and six St. Louis players scored as the Blues beat the Los Angeles Kings.</p>
        <p>Turek and the Blues shut down the Kings, who entered as the N.H.L.'s highest-scoring team with 29 goals in their first seven games.</p>
        <p>MAPLE LEAFS 4, OILERS 1: Mats Sundin had two goals and an assist to lead the Toronto Maple Leafs over the Edmonton Oilers.</p>
        <p>Curtis Joseph stopped 18 shots and has won all seven games he has played against his former team since joining the Leafs in the 1998-99 season.</p>
