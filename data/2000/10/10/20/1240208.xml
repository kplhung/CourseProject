        <p>As readers may know, I am a caricaturist and recently brought a lawsuit against Margo Feiden Galleries, which has represented me for many years, in order to regain what I considered to be proper control over my artworks.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As readers may know, I am a caricaturist and recently brought a lawsuit against Margo Feiden Galleries, which has represented me for many years, in order to regain what I considered to be proper control over my artworks. We have settled that lawsuit and entered into a new contract replacing a 1974 agreement.</p>
        <p>In an Oct. 14 Arts pages article, Margo Feiden was quoted as saying that our new contract is ''very much the same'' as the previous one. My view is different: the new contract is dramatically different from the 1974 agreement, and under it I have the control I sought over my drawings  not only for exhibition of works in museums but also other rights in my works.</p>
