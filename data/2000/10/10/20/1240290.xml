      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Lazio campaign released a new 30-second advertisement yesterday in response to a Clinton ad that attacked Rick A. Lazio for missing votes this year in the House of Representatives in order to campaign. It is also the first ad to directly criticize Hillary Rodham Clinton's failed 1993 attempt to overhaul health care.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- A black screen with scrolling white text, as if it were a Teletype. (In the background is a clacking sound like that of a Teletype.) The commercial copies the format of the advertisement it seeks to rebut.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''The Daily News says Hillary Clinton's ads have, quote, 'twisted the truth to the breaking point.' Rick Lazio actually has a 96 percent voting attendance score. Now, here's the record Hillary Clinton is trying to hide. Her plan for government-run health care would have devastated New York's teaching hospitals and cost 72,000 local jobs. Hillary has supported 15 tax increases, including higher taxes on Social Security benefits. Hillary Clinton. A record New York cannot afford.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Lazio's attendance score has been slipping as he misses votes for the campaign, including yesterday's, when he released the commercial. Last year, he was present for 99 percent of the votes in the House, according to The Congressional Quarterly. (The average was 96.5 percent.) The 96 percent figure used here derives from House records through Oct. 11. Mr. Lazio's claims about the impact of Mrs. Clinton's health care proposal come from news reports at the time. When asked at the candidates' first debate about the effect her plan would have on New York, Mrs. Clinton said that she was supportive of using federal money for teaching hospitals and that her health care proposal was ''a starting point, a basis for argument and compromise within the legislative process.'' The assertion that Mrs. Clinton has supported 15 tax increases is a distortion. The basis for this claim is President Clinton's 1993 budget proposal and other taxes he proposed as governor of Arkansas. This year, Mrs. Clinton proposed a package of tax cuts amounting to nearly $500 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- This commercial, which falls in line with the Lazio campaign philosophy of fighting attack ads with attack ads, includes a change in slogans from ''Hillary Clinton. You just can't trust her'' to ''Hillary Clinton. A record New York cannot afford.'' The change, which a senior campaign adviser says is not permanent and was done in part to play off the tax issue, appears less than three weeks before the election and as some Republican officials have criticized the direction, or lack thereof, of the Lazio campaign. Mr. Lazio and his advisers say they are satisfied with the campaign, but plan to emphasize and contrast the candidates' records and positions on issues more frequently. This commercial's legitimate point, that Mr. Lazio has generally been attentive to House matters outside of this Senate race, is somewhat undercut by the distorted strikes against Mrs. Clinton. Negative ads, however, can be effective, and this one could remind viewers of Mrs. Clinton's shaky record on legislative proposals while countering any doubts about Mr. Lazio's commitment to Congressional work.</p>
