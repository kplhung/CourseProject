        <p>Garry Kasparov offered and Vladimir Kramnik took a draw after only 11 moves of the seventh game of their Brain Games Network World Chess Championship in London yesterday. Kasparov spent 38 minutes and Kramnik 9 minutes on this remnant game.</p>

        <p>Garry Kasparov offered and Vladimir Kramnik took a draw after only 11 moves of the seventh game of their Brain Games Network World Chess Championship in London yesterday. Kasparov spent 38 minutes and Kramnik 9 minutes on this remnant game.</p>
        <p>The mystery is why Kasparov wasn't going all out to win and equalize the match, which Kramnik leads by one point, 4 to 3.</p>
        <p>He certainly must be mindful that every draw now brings Kramnik closer to the 8 1/2 points that will win the $1.33 million prize.</p>
        <p>Some reports from the playing hall say the champion looked tired when he came in. He may be ill, or he may simply be suffering from Kramnikphobia.</p>
        <p>In addition to winning Game 2, Kramnik outplayed Kasparov in Games 4 and 6, but let him escape. The challenger has had the upper hand throughout.</p>
        <p>For example, in Game 6, Kasparov was two pawns down, but found the marvelous queen post at f5.</p>
        <p>After that, Kramnik could no longer play to win, because after the only try, 66 Kg6 67 Qe8 Kh6 68 Kg2? Qd5 69 f3 Ne5!, he is obliged to take the draw by perpetual check or risk losing.</p>
        <p>Kasparov began with the English Opening, just as he did in Game 5, but varied with 3 d4 cd 4 Nd4, to open the center, instead of repeating his earlier 3 g3. He got no advantage then and neither does he now.</p>
        <p>The system of defense Kramnik chooses with 4 . . . a6 5 Nc3 e6 6 g3 Qc7 7 Qd3 Nc6 is solid and beyond reproach.</p>
        <p>Obtaining the exchange of knights with 8 Nc6 dc allowed him to continue his development with ease, after 9 g3, by 9 . . . e5 10 O-O Be6.</p>
        <p>One more move, 11 Na4, delivered with a draw offer, ended the game when Kramnik accepted.</p>
        <p>Game 8 is tomorrow at 3 p.m. London time (10 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time).</p>
