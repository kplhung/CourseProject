        <p>The traditional method of beating the Yankees has been to throw left-handers against them, to combat lineups stacked with left-handed hitters. The Mets are well equipped to do this and will start the left-handers Al Leiter and Mike Hampton in Games 1 and 2.</p>
        <p>But there is a twist to the Yankees' left-handed hitters this year: they have hit pretty well against left-handed pitchers. They do not always hit them hard, and do not always beat them. Leiter and Hampton, in fact, threw well against the Yankees this year and did beat them.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' left-handed hitters will not be overwhelmed, the way they might have been as recently as last year, but they acknowledged it would not be easy. ''You're talking about facing some quality pitchers,'' said David Justice, the Yankees' left fielder. ''It's going to be a challenge.''</p>
        <p>Justice is one of the few left-handed batters in baseball who hits left-handers better than right-handers. He batted .321 against lefties after joining the Yankees, with nine homers in 81 at-bats. He hit .299 against right-handers, with 11 homers in 194 at-bats.</p>
        <p>The Yankees emerged from their late-season offensive slump in the eighth inning of Game 2 of the American League Championship Series when Justice started a seven-run rally with a double off the Seattle left-hander Arthur Rhodes. Then, in Game 6, Justice ripped a decisive three-run homer off Rhodes.</p>
        <p>Feeling comfortable against left-handed pitchers, Justice said, is a day-to-day thing. ''Sometimes you feel great against them, sometimes you don't,'' he said. ''I'm not going to lie. If a left-hander puts it on the outside corner at the knees, I've got a tough day ahead of me.</p>
        <p>''Both Leiter and Hampton, they're good. You saw what they did to Edmonds.''</p>
        <p>They shut down Jim Edmonds, the Cardinals' left-handed slugger, in the National League Championship Series. But Justice added that he did not see any reason a left-handed hitter would be at an inherent disadvantage against a left-handed pitcher. ''I grew up playing against left-handers,'' he said. ''A lot of my buddies I grew up with were left-handed, so, early on, I was used to seeing guys throwing from that side. And another thing, I don't care if I get hit.''</p>
        <p>Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez has registered a higher average against lefties the last couple of years, in part because he has been good at holding his front shoulder in place as the pitch is coming in, rather than bailing out. Martinez does not hit left-handers for power as well as he does right-handers -- he had three homers in 171 at-bats against lefties this year -- but he does drive the ball through the middle and to left-center field.</p>
        <p>Martinez said it was important to keep his front shoulder tucked ''because if you don't, you're going to be in trouble.''</p>
        <p>''Every left-handed hitter has to do that against left-handed pitchers, because if you don't, you have no chance,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''You try to have good at-bats,'' said Martinez, before mentioning his teammate Jorge Posada. ''You know they're going to throw strikes. Jorge is probably going to be hitting behind me, so you don't want to try to do too much. If I can walk, I'll take a walk, or get hit by a pitch. Whatever it takes.''</p>
        <p>Against Leiter specifically, Martinez said, ''You've got to stay short and compact in your swing and go the other way and swing at strikes.''</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill batted .190 against lefties in 1999, the league's lowest average. This year he hit with an approach similar to that of Martinez. Hard-throwing left-handers, like Leiter, had success throwing high fastballs past O'Neill this year, but he batted .348 against lefties, most of the damage coming in the form of singles. O'Neill collected nine doubles and three homers in 158 at-bats against lefties, compared with 17 doubles and 15 homers in 411 at-bats versus right-handers.</p>
        <p>Some of the Yankees who usually hit lefties hard have not done so this year. Center fielder Bernie Williams's average against lefties has dipped over the last couple of years, a typical progression for a switch-hitter; Williams is naturally right-handed and hit lefties very hard in the past, but he has a more refined left-handed swing now because of more frequent opportunities against right-handed pitching.</p>
        <p>Posada, another switch-hitter, is younger than Williams and still is stronger against lefties than right-handers, and Derek Jeter's .390 average against lefties this year was among baseball's highest. If Glen allen Hill starts at designated hitter, he can be potent. He hit eight homers in 59 at-bats against lefties this year, but he has not hit well against Leiter or Hampton in his career.</p>
