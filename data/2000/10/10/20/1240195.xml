        <p>Things are grievously stressed in the tenement home of the Boyle family when the curtain goes up on ''Juno and the Paycock,'' Sean O'Casey's bitter drama set in 1922 Dublin during the Irish civil war.</p>
        <p>Jack, the wastrel patriarch, is out of work and determined to stay that way.

        <p>Things are grievously stressed in the tenement home of the Boyle family when the curtain goes up on ''Juno and the Paycock,'' Sean O'Casey's bitter drama set in 1922 Dublin during the Irish civil war.</p>
        <p>Jack, the wastrel patriarch, is out of work and determined to stay that way. Dissembling with comic transparency and cavorting drunkenly with his equally dissolute neighbor, Joxer Daly, he manufactures shooting pains in his legs to keep potential employment at bay. His wife, Juno, is in a state of perpetual fury at his laziness, which keeps them living in squalor. Their son, Johnny, who lost an arm in the failed Easter rebellion against the English in 1916, has more recently been shot in the hip during a riot protesting the treaty that divided Ireland into the republican south and the loyalist north. He is a beaten man as the play begins, physically shriveled, emotionally haunted and, as is slowly revealed, fatally compromised.</p>
        <p>The only hope in the family resides in the daughter, Mary, a pretty young woman intent on maintaining her appearance, improving her mind and working for the cause of labor. Alas, she is no match for the male-dominated forces at work, both in her nation and in the household, and before the play ends she sees her virtue and her future sacrificed to the mindless, irresponsible pride that the playwright decries as the pathetic lifeline of the historically bedeviled Irishman. Her illegitimate child, fathered by an ill-chosen pretender to the middle-class professionalism and rectitude to which she herself aspires, faces a future that only the heroic Juno can imagine.</p>
        <p>''My poor little child that'll have no father,'' Mary wails.</p>
        <p>''It'll have what's far better,'' Juno responds, shouldering, as ever, responsibility for her family along with her fate. ''It'll have two mothers.''</p>
        <p>When the play was first performed at the Abbey Theater in Dublin in 1924, it reflected the anguish and futility of the working-class Irish back to its weary citizenry, and it staked O'Casey's claim as the successor to J. M. Synge as the nation's leading theatrical voice. It is a play, however, whose power has always transcended its time and place; in a review of a 1988 production on Broadway, Frank Rich of The New York Times found the Boyles' grinding poverty resonant in the city's epidemic of homelessness.</p>
        <p>Now, with tensions in the Middle East once again fanned into flame, the new production of ''Juno'' by the Roundabout Theater Company, which opened with grim timeliness last night at the Gramercy Theater, feels like a bludgeoning corollary of the news from Ramallah, a fearsome and heartbreaking reminder of the eroding humanity that is the cost of intractable civil strife.</p>
        <p>Under the direction of John Crowley, the associate director of London's Donmar Warehouse, where he first staged the play, the production takes a pointed but dramatically risky tack, beginning at a feverish height of tension and determinedly ratcheting it tighter. It opens with startling authentic film clips from rebellion-torn Dublin projected on a scrim curtain. The image fades to a dilapidated brick tenement before the curtain rises to reveal the sooty, ill-furnished squalor of the Boyles' front room, where Juno (Dearbhla Molloy) is cooking breakfast and Mary (Gretchen Cleevely) is dressing for work.</p>
        <p>The men arrive presently, and from the outset their snappish demeanors make it clear the family is well beyond the accommodating weariness that would allow life to go on with a semblance of normalcy. This is a household where antennae have been scraped raw, where discussion is conducted in the exasperated bellowing of oft-expressed frustration and where people bound together by blood and circumstance couldn't be more selfishly resentful of their individual fates. Things will only get worse for them, of course, and even the prospect of good fortune -- an inheritance that never arrives -- does not seriously threaten to make the family whole.</p>
        <p>The strategy has its power. A nerve-wracking thrum of impending calamity hangs heavy in the Boyle flat, mitigated only by Rae Smith's set, an ugly, sparely furnished room with a small window that lets in only angular sunlight and a grimy ceiling prominently overhead. The ceiling is far too high for a tenement, but it feels less like a hole in the play's realism than a theatrical necessity, allowing space not only for the actors' high dudgeon to dissipate but for the audience to breathe. Even so, by the time the play ends, first with a nearly broken Juno in an agonizing lament to the Virgin Mary, then with Jack's famously drunken complaint -- ''the whol' world's in a terrible state o' chassis'' -- each taking a turn alone onstage, the room is dank and stuffy with despair.</p>
        <p>One result of the production's relentless tension, however, is that it gives rise to performances that are clamorously insular. The actors are playing people who don't grow into their shells as a result of the action; they're in them from the start. O'Casey, in all of his plays, was particularly deft at creating an enclosed social environment that seethed with natural life, gurgling with lyrical humor and with shared as well as privately held emotion. His plays, acrid and critical of his own people, were tempered with affection, and thus, deep sadness.</p>
        <p>But many of the performances here, all with fierce emotions ablaze, feel isolated from one another, and what one is hungry for throughout this production is a freer exchange in the ensemble. This is particularly true in the midplay scene in which the Boyles -- with Joxer, Mary's suitor Mr. Bentham and a neighbor, Maisie Madigan -- celebrate their presumed windfall with whisky and song. In spite of a lovely, touching duet by Mary and her mother, their arms sweetly interlocked, there remains something unrelaxed in the scene as a whole, as if these were strangers only pretending to be intimate.</p>
        <p>It's possible there's a culture clash at work. The strongest of the principals here are the two native Irish actors, Jim Norton as Jack Boyle and Ms. Molloy as Juno, both of whom command the stage with the force of authenticity and, even at the distance their characters keep from each other, engage with an animosity born of long proximity.</p>
        <p>Thomas Jay Ryan, with a walrus mustache and clad in soiled tweeds, his hair greasily plastered to his head, certainly looks the part of the untrustworthy good-for-nothing Joxer, and he works terrifically hard, from his pinched-shouldered posture to a surprising nimbleness that is sparked by his visceral terror of Juno. But the effort shows; he and the rest of the Americans in the cast seem inwardly focused, because they're either fulfilling the director's vision or straining to be Irish, or both.</p>
        <p>Still and all, this is not a show that one shrugs off. The palpable effects of living in perpetual crisis is bruisingly rendered here; it's a production that succeeds in stringing itself taut and that even now, maybe especially now, makes O'Casey's angry howl vibrate with credibility.</p>
