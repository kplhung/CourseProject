        <p>President Clinton said today that he would no longer sign multiday, stopgap spending measures, and sought to inject a sense of urgency into slow-moving Congressional deliberations over bills needed to keep the federal government running.</p>
        <p>Speaking to a group of Democratic senators and representatives, the president said that when the temporary spending bill, or continuing resolution, approved by the House and Senate today expired on Wednesday, he would only sign stopgap bills that lasted one day.</p>
        <p>''I think you need to go out and get everything done you can,'' Mr. Clinton said to a cheering group of Democratic lawmakers, who probably saw him as a group for the last time as president.</p>
        <p>''I will stay here with you,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''If we don't finish by Wednesday, we're going to day-by-day continuing resolutions.'' He also used the meeting to criticize Gov. George W. Bush for comments in Tuesday's debate about a patients' bill of rights in Texas.</p>
        <p>The stopgap spending bills are needed for the government to continue spending money because its authority to do so expired when the fiscal year ended on Sept. 30. Unless the continuing resolutions are passed by Congress and signed by the president, federal workers like Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and air traffic controllers cannot be paid and federal payments for Social Security, Medicare and veterans' pensions cannot be made.</p>
        <p>In recent days, Democrats have complained that the Republican leadership was stalling on reaching agreement with the White House on several politically fragile spending bills and was not feeling any pressure from rank-and-file Republicans to complete negotiations with the administration.</p>
        <p>Today, with Democrats asserting that they were fed up with what they said were delays, the House and Senate approved another stopgap financing measure, this one due to expire at midnight Wednesday.</p>
        <p>For their part, Republican leaders accuse Democrats of being obstructionists and say the delay comes from Republican efforts to prevent Democrats from engaging in profligate spending.</p>
        <p>''The White House and Congressional Democrats are unwilling to let go of the surplus, and that is why we're in Washington today,'' said Representative Tom Delay of Texas, the majority whip.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's threat has upped the ante in what in past years has been a high stakes endgame between the White House and Congressional Republicans by raising the specter of a government shutdown.</p>
        <p>In addition to approaching brinkmanship, moving to one-day temporary spending measures means that lawmakers must stay in Washington to pass a new stopgap bill each day while negotiations between Congress and the White House take place.</p>
        <p>During most of this month, while the government has been operating on a weeklong spending authority, many lawmakers have remained at home campaigning for re-election for as many as five days at a time, returning to Washington for only two days of work.</p>
        <p>Some Republican leaders say that the strategy may backfire because requiring Congress to pass one-day spending bills will leave little time for lawmakers to do anything else, including finishing work on the remaining spending measures.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, the House and the Senate approved a $130.7 billion bill that finances several agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
        <p>Four spending bills -- all of which contain contentious issues, including education -- are still to be passed.</p>
        <p>Some Republicans say they believe the White House threat to sign only one-day stopgap spending bills  is little more than a publicity stunt. These Republicans say that Congress should have reached agreement and finished its work on the outstanding spending measures by next Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''I think the White House is just trying to create a little drama,'' said John P. Feehery, a spokesman for the Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, ''and we dare to be dull.''</p>
