        <p>After an 18-month renovation, the rundown rows of empty buildings that, like battered bookends, long filled the corners of Morningside Avenue at West 117th and West 118th Streets in central Harlem, have been turned into 49 condominium apartments.</p>
        <p>The one- to three-bedroom units were carved from refurbished interiors created behind the restored brick facades of the buildings. Each of the two rows of six 19th-century buildings was combined into a pair of five-story structures. One is at 371 West 117th Street; the other is at 370 West 118th Street.</p>

        <p>After an 18-month renovation, the rundown rows of empty buildings that, like battered bookends, long filled the corners of Morningside Avenue at West 117th and West 118th Streets in central Harlem, have been turned into 49 condominium apartments.</p>
        <p>The one- to three-bedroom units were carved from refurbished interiors created behind the restored brick facades of the buildings. Each of the two rows of six 19th-century buildings was combined into a pair of five-story structures. One is at 371 West 117th Street; the other is at 370 West 118th Street.</p>
        <p>The residences, including several duplexes, have 648 to 1,225 square feet. All have been sold for $60,083 to $146,959 to buyers with annual household incomes of $28,000 to $70,950.</p>
        <p>The $6.8 million project, called Morningside Parc, looks across  Morningside Avenue to Morningside Park. Its 49 units were developed with city and state subsidies, under the Partnership New Homes Program. Its sponsors include the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the New York City Housing Partnership, with further support from the New York State Affordable Housing Corporation.</p>
        <p>This project ''is a good example of how renovating existing buildings can be another vehicle to providing affordable homeownership,'' said Charles Brass, president of the housing partnership.</p>
        <p>The project's developer and community sponsor is the nonprofit Harlem Community Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development agency. Galaxy General Contracting of the Bronx is the builder. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and the Community Preservation Corporation each provided $2.03 million in construction financing.</p>
        <p>Morningside Parc is the long-awaited second phase of a larger renovation project totaling 148 condo units in former city-owned buildings on parts of both sides of West 117th Street between Manhattan and Morningside Avenues and stretching to West 118th Street. The first phase was completed in 1990, and it took four years to sell all 49 units in a market that was then in a downturn, with Harlem properties lagging those elsewhere in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Today the opposite is true. The current 49 apartments were sold within four months through a lottery that drew more than 550 applicants, said Diane P. Phillpotts, the president of Harlem Community Development.</p>
        <p>Lisa M. Stevenson, who is in her mid-30's and works for a nonprofit theater services group in Manhattan, is buying a one-bedroom condo at the project.</p>
        <p>''Without this project I would still have to rent or move to Queens or New Jersey to buy,'' she said. ''I can now own my own piece of Manhattan, stay in the neighborhood and be part of the genesis in Harlem.''</p>
        <p>According to the city's housing preservation agency, it has invested more than $300 million in Harlem since 1994 and has 20,000 residences completed, under way or planned. That includes 4,200 homeownership units, which Carol Abrams, a department spokeswoman, said ''tracks with what the three Harlem community boards are advocating.''</p>
        <p>Among the larger recent projects is Renaissance Plaza, which is nearing completion on Lenox Avenue and West 116th Street. It includes 62,000 square feet of stores topped by 241 city-subsidized co-ops. Another large project is planned at 1400 Fifth Avenue between 115th and 116th Streets. It will have 129 condos above 25,000 square feet of stores.</p>
        <p>Prices of existing homes in Harlem are rising. The average sales price for condo apartments in Manhattan above West 110th Street and East 96th Street was $184,013 in the second quarter of this year, up from $171,286 in the same period in 1999, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. At the same time the board put the average sales price for town houses at $266,780, up from $224,538.</p>
        <p>Along with public subsidies lowering the price of each Morningside Parc unit by $33,000, the project has been granted tax abatement from the city, which will effectively keep real estate taxes at a minimum for 30 years. Monthly common charges, including taxes, are initially projected to be $259.52 to $489.38; without the abatement they would be $270.40 to $509.89.</p>
        <p>The buildings that make up Morningside Parc as well as those in the larger development had been taken over by the city through tax foreclosure. In time they became ugly bruises on the two blocks.</p>
        <p>That began to change in 1989 with the project's first phase, which included the renovation of a six-story mid-block building on the south side of West 117th Street into 42 condominiums. Also, four brownstones on the north side of the street were converted into 8 condominiums.</p>
        <p>Nearly 10 years passed between the completion of the project's first phase and the start of the second, a delay due mainly to the downturn in the real estate market.</p>
        <p>Along with restoring the facades of the former walk-up buildings, the renovation, designed by Roger C. Lewis &amp; Associates of Rockville Centre, N.Y., included new plumbing and heating systems, elevators and lobbies. Each complex also has such amenities as a community room and a landscaped rear courtyard.</p>
        <p>The apartments feature oak floors, ceramic tile bathrooms and washer and dryer hookups. Many also offer park views. Buyers will be able to start occupying their units by the end of November.</p>
        <p>Construction of the project's third phase is expected to start early next year. It will include 47 condos created from seven buildings on the south side of West 117th Street from mid-block west to the corner of Morningside Avenue. The seven are to be renovated into two structures, completing the transformation of the block begun over a decade ago.</p>
