        <p>The Doctors Council, a union representing salaried physicians, announced yesterday that the National Labor Relations Board had upheld the council's right to represent almost 200 doctors at Metropolitan Hospital in Manhattan. The labor board rejected an appeal by the New York Medical College, which employs the doctors at Metropolitan Hospital. The medical college had asked the labor board to overturn a unionization election held on April 18 in which Metropolitan's doctors voted, 89 to 22, for the Doctors Council.</p>
