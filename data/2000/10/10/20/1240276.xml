        <p>The scene was hidden by the dugout roof, but may have been the most surprising development for the Mets in the National League Championship Series.

        <p>The scene was hidden by the dugout roof, but may have been the most surprising development for the Mets in the National League Championship Series. On Monday night, with a chance to clinch a World Series berth, the Mets had loaded the bases in the fourth inning -- and the normally low-key Edgardo Alfonzo was standing in the dugout, yelling.</p>
        <p>According to players around him, Alfonzo was screaming for his teammates to keep attacking the Cardinals and build on the 3-0 lead that the Mets had taken in the first. Todd Zeile cleared the bases by driving a double off the right-center-field wall. Those three runs were the death knell for the Cardinals, but began a party at Shea.</p>
        <p>Off camera, a leader continued to grow. Alfonzo may be the Mets' best all-around player, but no one had mistaken him for being outspoken. That night, he was as vocal as anybody on the Mets. It is a trait Alfonzo is developing, and one his teammates have embraced.</p>
        <p>''He's really evolved in becoming the leader of this club,'' said Pat Mahomes, a relief pitcher who has so far been kept off the Mets' postseason roster. Mahomes said he watched Alfonzo's display with admiration. ''I think in the past he's always known he can play at this level. I think finally he's starting to see that he's really something special, and that he's a person that can say something and people will listen to what he's saying.''</p>
        <p>Even though he was named to his first All-Star team in July and is appearing in his second consecutive postseason, this may be Alfonzo's first true taste on center stage. As the Mets kept winning in the division series and then the N.L.C.S., more attention was heaped on their second baseman. Alfonzo is quiet by nature, preferring to let his personality shine with a dry humor. That often involves rubbing his fingers together to produce a buzzing sound in a reporter's ear, which usually sends the victim jumping.</p>
        <p>In his native Venezuela, the modest Alfonzo is a star. He received one of the loudest ovations at a charity softball game in Caracas last January that was held to benefit victims of deadly flooding outside of the Venezuelan capital.</p>
        <p>''He's a big man down there,'' said Alfonzo's older brother, Edgar, a minor league manager for the Mets. ''He's one of the best players we have down there. He's a quiet guy, but he's famous.''</p>
        <p>Edgar is the same way and taught his brother to be respectful. Edgardo Alfonzo has done the same with the Mets' younger Latin players, from Rey Ordonez several years ago to Melvin Mora last season to Timo Perez this month. Perez credited Alfonzo with teaching him to act like a big leaguer, but these days Alfonzo is reaching all corners of the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>So why has the player that Mike Piazza once labeled ''our silent assassin'' suddenly spoken up? His teammates point to several reasons.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo, who turns 27 next month, has been one of the most mature players in the Mets' clubhouse since he was a rookie in 1995. He has developed into too dangerous a hitter and accomplished a fielder to lack self-confidence, but teammates are starting to see something else.</p>
        <p>''It's probably more of him realizing he's as good as he is, and it's appreciating it and not having to be shy,'' said third baseman Robin Ventura. ''There's a certain shyness that he has that draws him away from attention. He also realizes there's nothing he's going to be able to do about it. He's not going to play bad just to stay away from it. I think there is a certain thing that goes on with him that now he's able to balance both of those.''</p>
        <p>That description also fits Ventura, one of the most admired Mets. ''Nah, he's a much better player,'' he said, referring to Alfonzo.</p>
        <p>A lasting image from last season was the sight of a misty-eyed Alfonzo sitting in the dugout at Turner Field in Atlanta after Kenny Rogers's bases-loaded walk ended the Mets' season two victories short of the World Series. Every player on that team knows how exhausting the final month of last season was. But Alfonzo told his brother last week that this team was different.</p>
        <p>''To go so far and in the end we couldn't finish it up, it must be something,'' Edgardo Alfonzo said. ''Now we have an opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Alfonzo could have waited for one of the older players to speak up. The Mets are full of talented veterans, but there is not a brash mouth among the everyday players. Mahomes acknowledged that the most fiery guys are on the bench.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of guys that try to get guys fired up, but you usually don't see that from him,'' Mahomes said. ''I think he realizes that this is a very good chance for us to do something special.''</p>
        <p>The veteran Darryl Hamilton, one of those bench players, said: ''I think he's getting into it a little more, and that's not a bad thing, especially now that it's playoff time and the World Series. He knows how difficult it is to be in this position. He understands how close we came last year without getting it done. It's good to have a guy that realizes how difficult this is to be our leader, because when you sit back and say, 'This is something that's cool,' and 'This is great,' you forget that it doesn't happen too often.''</p>
        <p>Alfonzo has hit in all nine of the Mets' playoff games this month. He batted .444 in the N.L.C.S. and holds the club record with 16 postseason runs batted in, which he has accomplished over two seasons.</p>
        <p>Still, Alfonzo's greatest contribution against the Cardinals may have been the observation he made after the Mets lost Game 3, 8-2. He said the Mets gave up, a startling admission that teammates initially disagreed with. Alfonzo said the Mets needed to be more aggressive, from the reserves on the bench to the players on the field. Following up his words with his bat, he drove in the first of four Mets runs in the first inning in what became a 10-6 victory in Game 4.</p>
        <p>''If you know something's wrong, you want to see what it is,'' Alfonzo said.</p>
        <p>Ventura was one of the players who did not agree with Alfonzo at first, but he now has a more nuanced view.</p>
        <p>''If he feels that way, then obviously there was something there to make him feel that way,'' Ventura said, ''which was enough for everybody to take notice of.''</p>
