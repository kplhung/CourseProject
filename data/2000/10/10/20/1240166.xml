        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 10.</p>

        <p>* ''ALMOST FAMOUS,'' starring Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written and directed by Cameron Crowe (R, 120 minutes). Mr. Crowe's loose, affectionate look back on his earlier career as a teenage rock journalist overflows with wonderful performances and memorable moments. Mr. Fugit brings the perfect balance of intelligence and innocence to the role of William Miller, a San Diego teenager who takes to the road with a scruffy band called Stillwater, on assignment for Rolling Stone. ''Almost Famous'' isn't perfect -- it lacks a necessary dimension of demonic sleaze -- but Mr. Crowe's smart, compassionate writing and performances by Mr. Crudup, Ms. Hudson, Jason Lee and Frances McDormand (among many others) make it hum (A. O. Scott).</p>

        <p>* ''ALMOST FAMOUS,'' starring Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written and directed by Cameron Crowe (R, 120 minutes). Mr. Crowe's loose, affectionate look back on his earlier career as a teenage rock journalist overflows with wonderful performances and memorable moments. Mr. Fugit brings the perfect balance of intelligence and innocence to the role of William Miller, a San Diego teenager who takes to the road with a scruffy band called Stillwater, on assignment for Rolling Stone. ''Almost Famous'' isn't perfect -- it lacks a necessary dimension of demonic sleaze -- but Mr. Crowe's smart, compassionate writing and performances by Mr. Crudup, Ms. Hudson, Jason Lee and Frances McDormand (among many others) make it hum (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''BAMBOOZLED,'' starring Damon Wayans, Savion Glover and Jada Pinkett-Smith. Written and directed by Spike Lee (R, 135 minutes). Mr. Lee's answer to ''Network'' is a scaldingly funny satire of the television industry in which a failing network hits the ratings jackpot with an old-time black minstrel show that resurrects offensive stereotypes. Accepted as hip, ironic and liberating by mainstream audiences but reviled by black militants, it starts a national craze for wearing blackface. If this messy cinematic collage goes every which way, its anger at a television industry that largely excludes blacks and whose black programming (in the director's view) perpetuates minstrelsy is right on target. Mr. Wayans plays the black Harvard-educated executive who dreams up this Frankenstein monster of a show (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''BEST IN SHOW,'' starring Jennifer Coolidge, Christopher Guest, John Michael Higgins, Michael Hitchcock, Eugene Levy, Jane Lynch, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara and Parker Posey. Directed by Mr. Guest (PG-13, 89 minutes). In the mold of Mr. Guest's earlier cult favorites, ''This Is Spinal Tap'' and ''Waiting for Guffman,'' this semideadpan satire spoofs the world of dog shows. A cross section of American eccentrics gather with their prized pets at a Philadelphia competition. The humor in this largely improvised film is barbed and condescending but rarely vicious. Like most skit comedy, the whole is somewhat less than the sum of its parts. Great fun, nonetheless (Holden).</p>
        <p>''BILLY ELLIOT,'' starring Gary Lewis, Julie Walters and Jamie Bell. Directed by Stephen Daldry (R, 90 minutes). Mr. Daldry's debut feature tells the story of an 11-year-old coal miner's son in northern England who dreams of becoming a ballet dancer. The movie holds few surprises; you always know where it's going, and sometimes you can predict exactly what the characters are going to say. But Mr. Daldry finds honest feeling and dramatic integrity in shopworn material, and the cast, notably Mr. Lewis as Billy's father, Ms. Walters as his teacher and young Jamie Bell as Billy himself, help rescue the movie from its most hackneyed impulses (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''THE CONTENDER,'' starring Gary Oldman, Joan Allen, Jeff Bridges and Christian Slater. Written and directed by Rod Lurie (R, 132 minutes). A political thriller pumped up with as much dramatic juice as ''The Contender'' doesn't have to be believable to be gripping. If this lurid Washington yarn about a sex scandal that threatens to destroy the hand-picked nominee (Ms. Allen) of the liberal President (Mr. Bridges) to fill a vacated vice presidential slot clanks with tin-eared oratory and preposterous plot turns, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Scenery-chewing performances by Mr. Oldman (as the scrofulous, misogynist congressman who leads the smear campaign), Mr. Bridges as a Clinton-Johnson presidential amalgam and Ms. Allen as the dignified and high-principled nominee contribute to the fun (Holden).</p>
        <p>''DANCER IN THE DARK,'' starring Bjork and Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Lars von Trier (R, 134 minutes). Mr. von Trier's new musical, shot in raw, jumpy digital video, is a fascinating exercise in brutality, mitigated by the otherworldly charisma (and the music) of the Icelandic pop star Bjork. As Selma, a Czech immigrant factory worker going blind in the early 1960's in Washington State (the film was shot in Sweden), Bjork seems to be inventing a whole new style of film acting, and her performance is miraculous. Mr. von Trier, continuing his campaign to rescue the art of film from complacency and convention, follows Selma's utter annihilation with sadistic relish. ''Dancer in the Dark'' is both stupefyingly bad and utterly overpowering; it can elicit, sometimes within a single scene, a gasp of rapture and a spasm of revulsion. Go to the theater prepared, with a handkerchief in one hand and a rotten tomato in the other (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''DR. T AND THE WOMEN,'' starring Richard Gere. Directed by Robert Altman (R, 122 minutes). Like last year's ''Cookie's Fortune'' (which was also written by Anne Rapp), Mr. Altman's new comedy has a mellow, rambling feel. The keen edge of social criticism that characterized masterpieces like ''Nashville'' and ''The Player'' has been blunted somewhat, but Mr. Altman remains an unparalleled choreographer of chaos. Mr. Gere, playing a harried, gentlemanly Dallas gynecologist, is virtually the only man in the movie, and his generous performance anchors the film and provides a foil for wonderful supporting turns by Kate Hudson, Laura Dern, Helen Hunt and Shelley Long (Scott)</p>
        <p>* ''GIRLFIGHT,'' starring Michelle Rodriguez, Jaime Tirelli and Paul Caldron. Directed by Karen Kusama (R, 90 minutes). Ms. Kusama's debut feature is a fierce, sweet, somewhat predictable boxing picture with a novel twist that makes all the difference: the contender is a young woman. What makes the movie something more than a smart, feminist sports movie (which is already something) is the presence of Ms. Rodriguez in the leading role, an angry Brooklyn teenager named Diana Guzman who finds dignity and discipline in the ring. Ms. Rodriguez is like a female Marlon Brando, with an overpowering, slow-burning charisma that few actresses of any era can match. Her performance is a knockout (Scott).</p>
        <p>''LADIES MAN,'' starring Tim Meadows. Directed by Reginald Hudlin (R, 90 minutes). For what it is -- a ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch inflated to feature length -- ''The Ladies Man'' isn't bad at all. Mr. Meadows plays Leon Phelps, a Chicago D.J. whose idea of sex-machine suavity ---to say nothing of his taste in clothes -- probably would have seemed tired in 1974. To eke out 90 minutes of amusingly dirty-minded gags, Leon must flee from a gang of jealous husbands and discover his true feelings for his long-suffering producer, gamely played by Karyn Parsons. For maximum enjoyment, bring along a bottle of Courvoisier and a jar of pickled pigs' feet (Scott).</p>
        <p>''LOST SOULS,'' starring Winona Ryder and Ben Chaplin. Directed by Janusz Kaminsky (R, 102 minutes). Most of the neighborhoods in which ''Lost Souls'' plays are bound to be scarier than this horror movie retread, and it's probably a bad idea to release an ''Exorcist'' remake while the original is enjoying a 25th anniversary re-release. Ms. Ryder is part of a team of renegade religious professionals and Catholic priests -- the X-Fathers -- performing exorcisms to prevent the birth of Satan. Mr. Chaplin may just be that person, though his career as a smug author exploiting the lives of serial killers should probably tag him as the personification of Evil. Mr. Kaminsky, the talented cinematographer who shot ''Saving Private Ryan'' and ''Schindler's List,'' makes his directorial debut with this feature, which has intriguing visual details. To those who wonder why, we can only suppose that perhaps the Devil made him do it (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''MEET THE PARENTS,'' starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 105 minutes). Mr. De Niro's scowl has become the kind of cultural shorthand that generally presages entry into the Smithsonian, where it can lie in state next to the Fonz's jacket, Archie Bunker's chair and Cher's hair. He uses it in this likable paranoid comedy, in which he plays every guy's worst nightmare: the father of his girlfriend. Mr. Stiller is the nervous, eager-to-please boyfriend, and the story plays out in a rustic suburban scenario that's too quiet: Martha Stewart's ''Night of the Living Dead'' (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''RATCATCHER,'' starring William Eadie. Directed by Lynne Ramsay (not rated, 94 minutes). This brilliant feature-film debut of Ms. Ramsay is a gorgeous blend of beauty and squalor, packed with imagery that will play over and over in your head for weeks. The movie follows a 12-year-old boy (William Eadie) in Glasgow during a few weeks in the early 1970's while a garbage strike is under way. The film's power comes from its hushed lyricism and a group of actors with an awe-inspiring openness to the camera (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''REMEMBER THE TITANS,'' starring Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Donald Faison and Ryan Hurst. Directed by Boaz Yakin (PG, 113 minutes). Like the action blockbusters its producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, is best known for, this story of a Virginia high school football team's painful, ultimately triumphant struggle to integrate is a relentless, pounding succession of big moments. Mr. Washington and Mr. Patton play two coaches who must overcome their own differences to build a winning team and their passage from hostility to respect to friendship is mirrored by the young men who play for them. The film, which takes place in 1971 and is based on a true story, is at times thumpingly corny, but it also offers some genuine, solid inspiration (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''REQUIEM FOR A DREAM,'' starring Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans. Directed by Darren Aronofsky (not rated, 102 minutes). Mr. Aronofsky's adaptation of the Hubert Selby Jr. novel is both a knockout and a downer. ''Requiem'' looks at the lives of four addicts (played by Mr. Leto, Ms. Burstyn, Ms. Connelly and Mr. Wayans) connected to one another by the bonds of love, friendship and family; it also emphasizes that the rituals of consumption are as important as the addiction. The tumble of imagery is powerful, almost overwhelming, and totally under the director's control, and though the material is bleak, ''Requiem'' offers the compensating high from an instinctive filmmaker (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''TIGERLAND,'' starring Colin Farrell. Directed by Joel Schumacher (R, 110 minutes). Shot in gritty, handheld 16 millimeter, Mr. Schumacher's film about a group of Vietnam-bound G.I.'s in 1971 Louisiana looks raw and real. But beneath the rough visual surface and the pungent profanity of the script lurks a hokey, phony melodrama that might briefly have seemed fresh and relevant 30 years ago. Mr. Farrell, the young Irish actor who plays an alienated rebel named Bozz, brings a winning bad-boy energy to his part, but his talent, and the talented supporting cast, can't save the movie from drowning in the shallows of Mr. Schumacher's imagination (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''YI YI (A ONE AND A TWO),'' starring Wu Nienjen. Directed by Edward Yang (not rated, 173 minutes). This nearly three-hour chronicle of the daily life and domestic turmoil of a middle-class Taipei family is so full of humor, life and delicate feeling that you may wish it were longer. Mr. Yang directs with classical precision and a relaxed, generous approach to storytelling. Wu Nienjen plays NJ Jian, a businessman whose midlife crisis is just one of a half-dozen stories that wind through this lovely film, which seems, in its unassuming, observant way, to cover the whole spectrum of human experience (Scott).</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>''TOTALLY TOTO.'' His name was Antonio de Curtis Gagliardi Ducas Comneno di Bisanzo. But adoring Italian filmgoers knew him simply as Toto (1898-1967). He was to Italy what Fernandel was to France, what Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd were to America, what Chaplin was to the world. A great comedian, he was a master of timing. The persona that made him so beloved was Neapolitan, with a face, like Keaton's, simultaneously inscrutable and communicative and a tongue that twisted words and phrases. This beloved comic is now the subject of a 15-film retrospective presented at the Walter Reade Theater by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Cinecitta. At 4:30 p.m. tomorrow, this series will present Amleto Palmeri's ''San Giovanni Takes Off,'' the 1940 comic tour de force in which Toto's Everyman persona emerged for the first time. With star-crossed lovers, feuding families and a crazed fight, this film tells of a porter whose excessive devotion to an image of St. John the Baptist arouses the ire of local residents. Another highlight of the weekend, at 8:30 p.m. tomorrow, is ''The Passionate Thief,'' the 1960 Mario Monicelli serio comedy that starred Anna Magnani and Ben Gazzara as out-of-work actors with Toto in the role of a pickpocket plying his trade at a lavish New Year's Eve party. The series continues through Oct. 31 at the Walter Reade at Lincoln Center. Admission: $9; $5 for Film Society members; $4.50 for the elderly at weekday matinees. Information: (212) 875-5600 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
