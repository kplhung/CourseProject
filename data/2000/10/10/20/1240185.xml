        <p>You can almost tell Jackie Chan's age by looking at his nose: the older he is, the wider his nose because it has probably been broken a few more times since you last saw him. As any fan of the Hong Kong action genre knows, the acrobatic Mr. Chan does all his own stunts and suggests much of the high-flying choreography for his films. There is probably no better platform for his inventive movement than the 1994 ''Legend of Drunken Master,'' a pluperfect vehicle for his tricky martial slapstick.</p>
        <p>It's one of the few instances when Mr. Chan isn't playing the reluctant yet astonishingly flexible coward who is forced to fight, a combination of Stan Laurel and Harold Lloyd. As Wong Fei-Hung, son of a kung fu master, he's not exactly eager, but he is plucky. And the silly and enjoyable conceit in ''Legend,'' originally subtitled and now dubbed into English, is that Fei-Hung actually has to get drunk to be any good at this specialized style of kung fu, literalization on the order of the Justice of ''Poetic Justice'' really being a poet.</p>

        <p>You can almost tell Jackie Chan's age by looking at his nose: the older he is, the wider his nose because it has probably been broken a few more times since you last saw him. As any fan of the Hong Kong action genre knows, the acrobatic Mr. Chan does all his own stunts and suggests much of the high-flying choreography for his films. There is probably no better platform for his inventive movement than the 1994 ''Legend of Drunken Master,'' a pluperfect vehicle for his tricky martial slapstick.</p>
        <p>It's one of the few instances when Mr. Chan isn't playing the reluctant yet astonishingly flexible coward who is forced to fight, a combination of Stan Laurel and Harold Lloyd. As Wong Fei-Hung, son of a kung fu master, he's not exactly eager, but he is plucky. And the silly and enjoyable conceit in ''Legend,'' originally subtitled and now dubbed into English, is that Fei-Hung actually has to get drunk to be any good at this specialized style of kung fu, literalization on the order of the Justice of ''Poetic Justice'' really being a poet.</p>
        <p>Sober or drunk, Fei-Hung is so proud of his technique that he describes each blow as he throws it, and the actor's game, expressive face glows. Mr. Chan, who does a lot of mugging, gets to use all the elasticity of his rubber face and play to the camera while participating in some of the most amazing stunts ever filmed.</p>
        <p>The climactic last battle, which takes place in a steel mill and, in addition to the stunning fights, has Mr. Chan falling into a pile of hot coals and later breathing fire, is breathtaking; it's as if the Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor of ''Singin' in the Rain'' had dared to take each other on, and the physical dynamism is superb. (This sequence is better than anything in ''The Matrix'' because there are no digital effects and Mr. Chan is seen in almost every frame.) It is fitting that the punch-outs bring dance numbers to mind, since Mr. Chan's wind-it-up version of drunken boxing looks like a lethal version of the Cabbage Patch.</p>
        <p>In ''Hong Kong Babylon'' (Hyperion Press, 1996), Fredric Dannen's book on the Hong Kong film industry, Mr. Chan tells the author that the epic throwdown that ends the film took four months to complete. That much effort wasn't expended in the writing. Although Mr. Dannen observes that ''no one leaves a Jackie Chan movie during the end credits,'' when outtakes showing mishaps are unspooled, he could have noted that no one really goes for the story, either.</p>
        <p>''Legend'' is nominally about Fei-Hung's involvement in an attempt to stop thieves from plundering Chinese cultural treasures. The narrative also whizzes through a switch of packages on a train and a battle that leads to the destruction of a two-story restaurant. (The scene appears to have been ''quoted'' in Ang Lee's ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' though half of all Hong Kong action films feature such a sequence).</p>
        <p>The film also includes one of the few Bruce Lee references in a Chan film: the bare-chested star standing at the ready with three slashes across his belly, like Lee in ''Enter the Dragon,'' and the hoariest of Hong Kong chestnuts, events that may force the closing of the kung fu school run by Fei-Hung's father, Master Wong (Ti Lung). There's even a lift from ''The Jazz Singer'' when Fei-Hung, after serially embarrassing his father, is kicked out of the house while his angry parent bellows, ''You're not my son!'' (Mr. Chan steals from himself, too; the scene of the loaded Fei-Hung belching bubbles was a bit he also used in this year's ''Shanghai Noon.'')</p>
        <p>If you feel as if you've seen this movie before -- and not just because of the rote reiterations of standard Hong Kong plot devices -- it's because ''The Legend of Drunken Master'' received a very limited United States release in 1995 as ''Drunken Master 2,'' the sequel to the frenzied action comedy that raised Mr. Chan to star status. Some movie buffs say the first ''Drunken Master'' is the best Chan movie ever made, but ''Legend'' is just as deserving of your time, if only because Mr. Chan looks older than both his father and his stepmother (Anita Mui, the star's real-life ex-girlfriend, who competes with him for camera time and outdoes him).</p>
        <p>The picture is crammed with subplots and with milling extras and activity making shrewd use of the wide screen. There are a few nice touches, like a softball being tossed back and forth on a train packed with people. Fans of ''Drunken Master 2'' will notice some trims, with some scenes ending a few beats earlier, and a new ''just say no'' emphasis, scoring an anti-alcohol point. They won't be able to argue against the improved audio technology, since in the previous version every blow sounded exactly the same.</p>
        <p>There is some accidental hilarity. When an opponent faces off against Mr. Chan in the big-deal final combat scene, the foe is brandishing a chain and posed, sweating in a T-shirt, against a fiery backdrop that makes it look as if a tussle of a much different sort -- perhaps calling for a little rough trade -- is about to break out. Quibble aside, if you have a taste for Hong Kong action (and I do) then ''The Legend of Drunken Master'' has enough going on to make it a classic. You'll want to own it -- that is, if you don't already have the first, subtitled version.</p>
        <p>''The Legend of Drunken Master'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes adult language, repeated sequences of brilliantly staged action and brutality, and, oh, yes, alcohol consumption.</p>
