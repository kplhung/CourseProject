        <p>There was rejoicing in the fashion flocks when the documentary film ''Unzipped'' appeared in 1995.

        <p>There was rejoicing in the fashion flocks when the documentary film ''Unzipped'' appeared in 1995. For in that movie, it seemed, was born an heir to the great and terrible Diana Vreeland, the fashion editrix whose biblical pronouncements on style were indeed gospel to men and women of the cloth -- the cloth being, in this case, silk organza or double-faced cashmere.</p>
        <p>Isaac Mizrahi, the subject of ''Unzipped,'' was a wild-haired designer who frankly came from Brooklyn instead of being an enameled mandarin with a self-invented past. Like Vreeland, however, Mr. Mizrahi found epiphanies in the shapes of shoes and necklines, and he expressed these religious responses with Wildean epigrams and theatrical flair. Arch and obsessive in one breath, this compulsive self-observer emerged as a puckish priest of style for the Age of Irony.</p>
        <p>That he is now the star of his own cabaret act, which opened last night at the Greenwich House Theater under the title ''Les MIZrahi,'' is perhaps inevitable. After all, Mr. Mizrahi, whose clothing company folded in 1998, came along when fashion, having mostly exhausted its old bag of tricks, had become more about presentation than clothes.</p>
        <p>As ''Unzipped,'' directed by Douglas Keeve, made abundantly clear, style was showmanship, a perception subsequently confirmed by the runaway success of a small one-woman play called ''Full Gallop,'' in which the actress Mary Louise Wilson impersonated Vreeland. Why shouldn't Mr. Mizrahi, still a relatively young (and even younger-looking) man, open a new chapter of his life on the stage?</p>
        <p>It would be gratifying to report that Mr. Mizrahi is indeed made for the stage; that, as an old Gloria Vanderbilt jeans commercial put it, ''The fit is fantastic!'' That isn't quite the case. The flamboyant, neurotic starlight that Mr. Mizrahi gave off in ''Unzipped'' is definitely in evidence in ''Les MIZrahi,'' which is directed by Richard Move and is the inaugural production in the Drama Dept.'s cabaret series. But the former designer hasn't quite figured out how to present himself in this incarnation, and the uncertainty creates some discomfort.</p>
        <p>Actually (and Mr. Mizrahi, with his knowledge of star trivia, is surely aware of this), the show recalls those old touring productions in which actors who had become Personalities and were -- er -- between jobs appeared in intimate vehicles in which they were simply themselves. Like such productions, ''Les MIZrahi'' lets its star sing, reminisce, dis, joke and vent.</p>
        <p>This being the year 2000, the theater-as-therapy aspect is much more upfront. (Don't forget that Liza Minnelli was once one of his clients.) In his opening song, ''Me and My Show,'' for which Mr. Mizrahi has set new lyrics to a Sondheim melody, he baldly addresses his quandary: ''A designer onstage? Where could I go?'' he asks. He needs love, he tells his audience, and he hopes it will oblige him.</p>
        <p>It is hard not to root for Mr. Mizrahi. He still has a boyish anxiety and eagerness to please that makes watching his show something like being a parent at your 11-year-old's piano recital. He was also, at the preview I attended, visibly nervous. It isn't easy being yourself in a spotlight, and Mr. Mizrahi hasn't yet developed the armored persona that even seemingly laid-back monologuists like Spalding Gray have acquired.</p>
        <p>He is at his best when he has something homey to do: cutting a coat from muslin on the sewing machine his father gave him as a boy; dispensing Rice Krispies treats to the audience; standing at an easel sketching dresses he designed for Audrey Hepburn (whom he adored) and Helen Hunt (whom he did not). Without such props, his narrative timing comes unmoored. And a sequence in which he watches inspirational clips of glamorous movie stars only points up how much better the same sensibility was conveyed in ''Unzipped.''</p>
        <p>In that documentary he was filmed in professional action, preparing a collection, naturally bringing a sense of theater to everyday life. Here he has to bring life to theater. And he is by far at his best when he is able to pretend that this isn't the case, as if he were simply chatting up an admiring acquaintance across a dinner table.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mizrahi is accompanied by the charmingly clean-cut Ben Waltzer Trio, and he has an appealing, unforced singing voice. In some songs, like ''When You're Smiling'' and ''Tea for Two,'' his gestures indicate that he has closely watched performers like Ms. Minnelli, Shirley MacLaine and Kay Thompson. His revenge number about the trials of the rag trade, a reworking of Gilbert and Sullivan's ''I've Got a Little List,'' isn't quite clever enough.</p>
        <p>Yet there is a moment when Mr. Mizrahi sits on a stool and delivers an utterly simple rendition of ''Baubles, Bangles and Beads,'' with an aching, self-exposing hopelessness that makes the song his own. It is so different from anything else in the evening that it makes you catch your breath and think, ''Hey, he could be a real cabaret performer.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime he is guaranteed a cult audience that will come for the inside digs at difficult divas and rival designers and the edicts on the philosophical significance of fur trim and Norman Norell. And oh yes, the clothes. They include an all-black Beat look a la Audrey Hepburn in ''Funny Face,'' a white-tie ensemble, a polka-dot lounging robe and a rhinestone-studded suit. He wears them well.</p>
        <p>LES MIZRAHI</p>

Harrington; lighting by Kirk Bookman; sound by Laura Grace Brown; video montage, Charles Atlas; production manager, Christian Douglas Cargill; musical director, Mr. Waltzer; stage managers, Sarah Bittenbender and Maria Ryan.
