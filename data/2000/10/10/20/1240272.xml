        <p>THE last time the Yankees lost a World Series, George Steinbrenner said he was sorry. ''I want to sincerely apologize to the people of New York and to the fans of the New York Yankees everywhere for the performance of the Yankee team in the World Series,'' the owner declared.</p>
        <p>This was 1981, and the Yankees had just lost in six games to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Earlier in that World Series, Steinbrenner disclosed that he had been involved in a brawl in a hotel elevator that no one ever believed. Earlier that month, Steinbrenner held a clubhouse meeting during a playoff series with Milwaukee and angered Rick Cerone to the point where the catcher cursed at him and called him a fat something or other.</p>
        <p>Is this any way to run a postseason ball club?</p>
        <p>The Mets don't expect such behavior from their owners in the upcoming World Series.</p>
        <p>''What happened?'' the right-hander Bobby J. Jones said, incredulity leaping from his mouth when the Steinbrenner apology was mentioned to him. After more details were related, he said, ''Really?'' and he laughed. When he stopped laughing, he said, ''I doubt that our owners would do anything drastic like that.''</p>
        <p>Turk Wendell agreed that Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday would not resort to such antics. ''I think they're a couple of very nice guys,'' the reliever said. ''The Mets' owners are a lot classier than George Steinbrenner.''</p>
        <p>Al Leiter, who worked for Steinbrenner at the start of his career, said he didn't know the Mets' owners very well but said they ''certainly are a lot different from George.'' Wilpon and Doubleday, he added, ''seem to be pretty easygoing from my perspective in this clubhouse.'' Had either owner ever come into the clubhouse and held a Steinbrenner-like meeting?</p>
        <p>''No,'' the pitcher replied, ''unless I was in the weight room at the time.''</p>
        <p>The Francos, two of the senior members of the Mets, couldn't cite any examples of outlandish behavior. ''They've always been nice to me,'' Matt Franco said. ''I don't remember reading anything negative in the papers. I don't believe I've heard them say anything.''</p>
        <p>John Franco said he has never heard either owner speak critically of a player and added, ''I don't remember them doing anything crazy.'' Nor would he expect them to do anything crazy if the Mets lose the World Series.</p>
        <p>Dennis Cook was another who said he had never heard the owners utter a negative word. ''In fact,'' he said, ''usually around here, whenever we got into a losing streak, they were the first ones to speak up and give their support for the team. It's always been a first-class organization.''</p>
        <p>Darryl Hamilton had nothing but good things to say about the owners.</p>
        <p>''I don't think our guys are like that,'' the outfielder said when some Steinbrenner stories were related. ''They're proud of us and always will be. Sure, we have a big series ahead of us. Not only is it the World Series, but it's against our crosstown rivals. Obviously you want to win bad. But I think ownership knows we're going to give them everything we have, and I think that's good enough for them.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton recalled a scene from last year's league series.</p>
        <p>''When we were down 2-0 against Atlanta, we had a workout here,'' he said. ''Mr. Wilpon came out on the field in a suit and tie while we were taking batting practice. He walked over to every guy in the field and put his arm around us and said, 'Hey, I got a lot of friends who called and said they're praying for my team.' I said: 'You don't have to pray for my team; my team's going to be O.K. They've given us everything they have. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.'</p>
        <p>''I'll never forget that,'' Hamilton said. ''This is the last place I figured an owner would be so cool to the fact that we're trying, and he knows that. For that reason, I got all the respect in the world for him. I'll never forget that. It was awesome.''</p>
        <p>So does Wilpon ever erupt? Does he ever show his emotions run amok?</p>
        <p>''Privately, in my box, I can be very emotional, but not against anybody else,'' he said yesterday. ''I get frustrated that we left a guy on third or whatever. At home, watching on television with my wife or kids, I can get quite emotional.''</p>
        <p>If the Mets were to lose this World Series to the Yankees, would a Steinbrenner-like statement be forthcoming with Wilpon's name attached? An apology to Mets fans? A nasty critique of his players? A Mr. May tag for Mike Piazza? Don't look for any of it.</p>
        <p>''I think I could handle it as a professional,'' Wilpon said, ''but that's not to say I wouldn't be disappointed.''</p>
        <p>If the Yankees should lose, on the other hand, the presses and the airwaves might burn up with a sizzling Steinbrenner salvo.</p>
