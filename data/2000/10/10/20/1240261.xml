        <p>As carnivalesque as the atmosphere has been in anticipation of Friday night's heavyweight fight between Mike Tyson and Andrew Golota, if something truly odd should happen -- like a clean fight -- the bout has a chance to be entertaining and even revealing.</p>
        <p>For all his unpredictability, Golota has boxing skills, and when he chooses to show them, he usually does so early in his fights. He may cower or self-destruct in later rounds, but Golota should come out against Tyson and at least try to land some big, first-round right hands.</p>
        <p>Friday night could be an important opportunity for Tyson to demonstrate, even if only for a round or two, how much of his old form he has retained. If Tyson is forced to fight, however briefly, maybe he can prove to the boxing community that he still has some credible expertise -- that he can punch in precise combinations and is not just the wild brawler who has been on exhibit in the three years since his disqualification for biting Evander Holyfield.</p>
        <p>An impressive, controversy-free Tyson victory might be enough to initiate talks about a title fight between Tyson and Lennox Lewis.</p>
        <p>Golota could disappoint and freeze at the fight's start, as he did when he was knocked out in the first round against Lewis in October 1997. But should Golota fight courageously against the early onslaught that is expected from Tyson, then Golota has much to gain, too. If he could upset Tyson in what is a scheduled 10-round, pay-per-view fight Friday, Golota would be catapulted into the heavyweight title picture. A victory for Golota, who is known for head butts and low blows, could redefine his career.</p>
        <p>Today, at the weigh-in, there were no surprises or out-of-bounds hostilities. Tyson, who has a 48-3 record, weighed 222 pounds, roughly what he has for each of his fights in the last few years. Golota, who is 36-4, weighed 240 pounds, normal for him.</p>
        <p>As he has for most of the week, Tyson appeared relaxed and carefree. Golota was not smiling, but he did not seem disturbed by Tyson's large entourage, which stalked around the podium where the weigh-in was conducted and occasionally taunted Golota.</p>
        <p>The tactics for the fight are fairly predictable. Expect Tyson, who is six inches shorter than Golota, to work to Golota's body with combinations that finish with right hands to the head. Tyson has also been working on his head movement, hoping he can avoid being an easy target for Golota's chopping punches.</p>
        <p>The plan seems to be for Tyson to duck under Golota's punches as he steps inside and digs into the massive torso of Golota.</p>
        <p>As much as Golota has faltered late in his last three defeats -- because he has either been disqualified for low blows or given up -- he probably wants the fight to go into the later rounds. Golota expects Tyson to charge from his corner when the bell rings, which  Tyson did in his first-punch knockout of Lou Savarese in June. Surviving those early moments will be a key for Golota, who needs to score with both hands, and he might have the edge if he can extend the fight.</p>
        <p>Golota has won two 10-round fights in the last two years, against Orlin Norris and Jesse Ferguson.</p>
        <p>Tyson has not won a fight that has gone more than five rounds since 1991, when he defeated Donovan Ruddock in 12 rounds.</p>
        <p>Considering the reputations of Tyson and Golota, the choice of the referee has been somewhat controversial. The Michigan state boxing commission chose a referee from the Detroit area, Frank Garza, who has never worked a fight this big.</p>
        <p>Garza, 48, has been a professional referee for 14 years and has never disqualified a boxer. He said he is not concerned with Tyson's or Golota's past misdeeds.</p>
        <p>''I'm absolving them of any past notoriety,'' Garza said. ''I'm not going to stop them from being the best they can be. My job is to protect them from being the worst they can be.''</p>
        <p>Zab Judah of Brooklyn, undefeated in 24 fights, will defend his International Boxing Federation junior welterweight championship against Hector Quiroz of California on the undercard Friday. Laila Ali, Muhammad Ali's daughter, who has a 7-0 record with seven knockouts, will meet Kendra Lenhart of Texas in a six-round light heavyweight match.</p>
