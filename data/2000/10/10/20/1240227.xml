        <p>The Democratic National Committee released a new commercial this week attacking Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to create private investment accounts in the Social Security system. Building on criticism that Vice President Al Gore directed at the Bush plan in the final presidential debate on Tuesday night, the commercial says Mr. Bush cannot meet his promise to create investment accounts for younger workers without shortchanging retirees.</p>
        <p>The commercial is running in 9 states and will be on the air in 11 states by Monday. Among them are swing states like Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Washington and Oregon. It is scheduled to run for a week to 10 days. Democratic officials said they expected to spend as much as $3 million to buy television time for the commercial.</p>

        <p>The commercial is running in 9 states and will be on the air in 11 states by Monday. Among them are swing states like Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Washington and Oregon. It is scheduled to run for a week to 10 days. Democratic officials said they expected to spend as much as $3 million to buy television time for the commercial.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Opens with pictures of Mr. Bush. Shifts to shots of dollar bills streaming by, followed by a pensive-looking older woman. Flashes the front page of The Wall Street Journal, and closes with a picture of Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Announcer: ''What would George W. Bush's plan do to Social Security? He's promising to take a trillion dollars out of Social Security so younger workers can invest in private accounts. Sounds good. The problem is: Bush has promised the same money to pay seniors their current benefits. The Wall Street Journal shows he can't keep both promises. Which promise is he going to break?''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The commercial is correct in saying that Mr. Bush is proposing to take $1 trillion out of the revenues from the payroll tax that finances Social Security benefits. That money would go to help establish accounts through which individuals could invest in stocks and bonds for retirement. But the commercial is somewhat misleading in its implication that Mr. Bush's plan would not leave enough money to pay current retirees.</p>
        <p>Social Security is taking in more money than it needs to pay benefits, although that situation will reverse in 15 years. Because of the complex way in which the government accounts for Social Security revenues, there is enough money available to pay benefits even if $1 trillion is diverted to private accounts in the next decade. On the other hand, Mr. Bush's plan would arguably move up the date at which the federal government would need to begin using general tax revenues to help pay benefits to current retirees.</p>
        <p>SCORE CARD -- The Gore campaign has been frustrated by its inability to make Mr. Bush pay a political price for his Social Security proposal, which would be the biggest change to the retirement system since its inception. The commercial tracks the theme Mr. Gore has emphasized on the stump for the last few days, that there is a price to be paid for the approach Mr. Bush is advocating. In political terms, the commercial is clearly intended to suggest that older people -- who reliably vote against tinkering with Social Security -- have something to fear from Mr. Bush. In doing so, it opens Mr. Gore to accusations of using scare tactics.</p>
