        <p>If independent film has a tough time these days, it was no easier in 1983.</p>
        <p>''Not so many good, individually stylish independent films reach commercial distribution that we can ignore those that finally break through, even when they are something less than perfect,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. ''In some cases the imperfections are what catch the attention, as in Slava Tsukerman's deadpan delirium of a drug dream, 'Liquid Sky.' ''</p>
        <p>Gone as quickly as one of its psychedelic eruptions, Mr. Tsukerman's film, recently released on tape and DVD by Wintertainment, stirred a flurry of raves then and is now recalled as a harbinger of the strangeness to come from filmmakers like David Lynch, Atom Egoyan and others.</p>
        <p>In every review was the admonition ''not for everyone,'' and so it isn't. A drug-besotted punk fantasy set in New York, ''Liquid Sky'' refers to heroin and involves Margaret, a leggy New York model with a painted face who spends much of her time getting beaten and raped, a snarly junky named Jimmy and Margaret's vicious little roommate, Adrian (Paula E. Sheppard), who deals drugs and runs a club patronized by creepy fashion editors and photographers who crowd Margaret's penthouse roof for games of sadistic voyeurism.</p>
        <p>Also on the roof is a spaceship the size of a dinner plate containing aliens who observe people and the city as brightly colored abstractions. The German astrophysicist (Otto Von Wernherr) who is studying them notes that they are not only as dependent on drugs as Margaret's crowd but also appear to derive energy from humans at the height of sexual pleasure.</p>
        <p>Not every film of this description receives a warm critical reception, but for all its ridiculous narrative, ''Liquid Sky'' conveys an oddly vibrant impression of city life. A Soviet immigrant, Mr. Tsukerman arrived in New York in 1976. Critics noted his  joy in having the liberty to express himself. ''For me freedom was very important,'' he said this week in an interview.</p>
        <p>''Liquid Sky,'' he added, is basically an unvarnished take on the subcultures he found here. The remarkable thing about the film is how the tawdriness generates richness. Much of the film's high style belongs to Anne Carlisle, who plays both Margaret and Jimmy with a perfect androgyny that makes them virtually interchangeable.</p>
        <p>''Where Mr. Tsukerman goes from here, I've no idea, but he seems to possess a rare and unusual talent,'' wrote Mr. Canby, who died on Sunday after a 35-year career as a Times film and theater critic. This week the director said he had finished an 18th-century love story starring Ben Gazzara and was looking for a distributor.</p>
        <p>''Hollywood wanted me to make another 'Liquid Sky,' only less shocking,'' he said. ''A positive, New Wave Cinderella story.'' For information about the original, call (800) 735-5847.</p>
