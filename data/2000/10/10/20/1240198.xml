        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>* POLLY BERGEN, Feinstein's, at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. Ms. Bergen's first New York club appearance in 35 years is a revelation. The singer, whose pop contralto is in fine shape despite having picked up some gravel, pours her life into songs with an intensity and a dramatic force matched by hardly any other veteran cabaret performer. This woman has been around, and she knows the score and still has joie de vivre and a sense of humor. Her versions of ''The Party's Over,'' ''The Ladies Who Lunch,'' ''Here's That Rainy Day,'' ''I Don't Remember Christmas,'' ''Why Was I Born?'' and ''Stars'' (Janis Ian's excoriation of fame) are close to definitive. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11. Cover: $50 for the late show tonight; $75 for the early show tonight and both shows tomorrow. Food and beverage minimum: $50 for early shows; $25 for late shows. Barbara Cook opens Tuesday; through Nov. 25 (Stephen Holden).</p>

        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>* POLLY BERGEN, Feinstein's, at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. Ms. Bergen's first New York club appearance in 35 years is a revelation. The singer, whose pop contralto is in fine shape despite having picked up some gravel, pours her life into songs with an intensity and a dramatic force matched by hardly any other veteran cabaret performer.

Food and beverage minimum: $50 for early shows; $25 for late shows. Barbara Cook opens Tuesday; through Nov. 25 (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>''BERLIN TO BROADWAY WITH KURT WEILL,'' Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 239-6200. If this is not a flawless revue, it is nevertheless an ingratiating tribute to Kurt Weill's achievement. Fridays at 10:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 4:30 and 7:30 p.m.; Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 3 p.m.; no performance Thursdays. Tickets: $45 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>BARBARA CARROLL, Bemelmans Bar, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. This agelessly chic red-haired pianist and singer seems to know every important popular song ever written and to be able to perform from memory in any key. Her elegant, lyrical pianism is a compendium of 20th-century jazz styles, from Count Basie to Erroll Garner to Bill Evans and beyond. And her clipped, understated vocals, which verge on speech-song, approach lyrics from a wry but warmhearted point of view. Tonight and tomorrow night beginning at 9:30, through Dec. 31. Michael Devine, Tuesdays through Saturdays at 5:30 p.m., through Dec. 30. Cover: $15 at table and $5 at the bar; no minimum (Holden).</p>
        <p>* HOWARD FISHMAN QUARTET, Sardi's, 234 West 44th Street, (212) 221-8440. Powerful echoes of Stephane Grappelli and Bix Beiderbecke are among the influences rippling through the Howard Fishman Quartet's seamless swing. The group -- Mr. Fishman on guitar, banjo and vocals; Russell Farhang playing virtuosic Grappelli-style violin; Erik Jekabson on trumpet; and Jonathan Flaugher on bass -- folds elements of vintage jazz, swing and early bluegrass into rhythmically animated, richly allusive jazz chamber music. Whether the music is Stephen Foster (a bubbly ''Old Folks at Home''), Gershwin (''Soon'') or Romberg (''When I Grow Too Old to Dream''), it is all translated into lilting, fine-tuned ensemble music that transcends time and idiom. Friday nights at 10:30. No cover charge, but $15 minimum at tables. The Howard Fishman Quartet also performs Sunday night at 8:30 (through Oct. 29) at Joe's Pub, Joseph Papp Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $12 (Holden).</p>
        <p>SALLY MAYES, Firebird Cafe, 363 West 46th Street, Clinton (212) 586-0244. The platinum-haired sometime Broadway performer (''She Loves Me'') has a nice feel for 1940's and 50's Broadway and swing music. One of the high points of her effervescent cabaret show (a best-of anthology from 10 years of her nightclub work) is the ''Savage Medley,'' a compendium of witty songs with elegantly salacious lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Another is her signature song, ''Miss Byrd,'' from the Off Broadway show ''Closer Than Ever.'' Best when she's peppy, Ms. Mayes is a bland balladeer. The show has superb musical direction by Patrick Brady. Tonight and tomorrow night at 11. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Also at the Firebird Cafe: tonight at 9, Toni Lamond, singer. Cover: $20; $15 minimum. Tomorrow night at 9, Alexandra Haas, singer. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Sunday night at 7, Babbie Green, part of the singer-songwriters series. Cover: $20; $15 minimum. Opening Wednesday, Steve Ross, singer and pianist, in ''Love and Laughter: The Sequel''; through Dec. 2 (Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Reprise Room at Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes. He focuses on what he calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, whose creamy baritone echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock concentrates on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's singer of ballads, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves that there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Tonight and Monday through Wednesday nights at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $50 and $55; ringside seating, $75 and $80 (Holden).</p>
