        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>BRITAIN, GERMANY: NORTH KOREA TIES  Britain and Germany plan to set up diplomatic relations with North Korea. Speaking to the BBC before a meeting of Asian and European leaders in Seoul, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain said, ''This opening of diplomatic relations is not in any way an approval of the conduct of the regime.'' Chancellor Gerhard Schroder told German television, ''It will happen.'' Neither country announced a date for setting up ties.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: DALAI LAMA MEETS ADAMS  The Dalai Lama began a three-day visit by sharing a moment of silent prayer in Belfast with Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political wing. The exiled Tibetan religious leader will meet with religious and community groups, as well as Irish and British political figures. The two men exchanged gifts: for Mr. Adams a long white silk scarf; for the Dalai Lama a Celtic cross.</p>

        <p>IRELAND: NEW OMAGH ARREST  The police arrested a fourth man in connection with the 1998 bombing that killed 29 people in Omagh, Northern Ireland. The Irish police can detain people suspected of terrorist acts for 72 hours without charge; a court extended this period by 24 hours for three suspects arrested on Tuesday. One has been freed, and the two others must be charged or released by today.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: CHARGED IN THAI RAPE  In the first case of its kind, a 47-year-old-transport worker has gone on trial for raping an 11-year-old girl during a ''sex holiday'' in Thailand seven years ago. He is the first person to stand trial under a 1994 law that allows suspects in ''sex tourism'' cases involving minors abroad to be prosecuted in France. Unicef, which is a civil plaintiff, estimates some two million children are pressed into prostitution, including 400,000 in Thailand.</p>

        <p>AUSTRIA: CAUGHT CHATTING  Transport Minister Michael Schmid, a member of the far-right Freedom Party, turned himself in to the police after television showed him breaking the law by using his mobile phone while driving a car. He issued an apology, saying he answered the phone ''on a reflex.'' He faces a fine of $18.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>MEXICO: CRYING FOUL IN VOTE  Candidates for governor in the state of Tabasco are calling for protests, new elections and an interim government to take over from the departing governor, Roberto Madrazo, a stalwart of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. A recount is under way after Sunday's vote, with the PRI candidate, Manuel Andrade, and his rival, Raul Ojeda of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, both claiming victory in a contest marked by irregularities. Mr. Ojeda and Jose Antonio de la Vega, from President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada's National Action Party, say the PRI stole the vote.</p>

        <p>CHILE: STRIKE DRIVES UP PRICES  Striking truckers blocked roads across Chile for a third day in a strike against a tax on diesel fuel. Short lines formed at fuel stations in Santiago, the capital, and market traders said fish and vegetable prices were climbing. The government backed down slightly from a previous stance of no talks, offering to negotiate an end to the dispute if the truckers stopped blocking roads.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>ZIMBABWE: CALM RETURNS TO CAPITAL  After three days of sporadic riots over the soaring cost of food, the townships near the capital, Harare, settled into an uneasy calm as the police and soldiers continued their patrols. The leading opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, said it planned to introduce a parliamentary motion calling for the impeachment of President Robert Mugabe.</p>

        <p>IVORY COAST: O.A.U. BOYCOTTS VOTE  The Organization of African Unity said it would not send observers to Sunday's presidential election, fearing it would legitimize an undemocratic process. Two major groups, the Democratic Party, which held power from independence until 1999's military takeover, and the Rally of Republicans, headed by former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara, will both boycott the poll after a Supreme Court ruling barring most challengers to the military ruler, Gen. Robert Guei.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: AMERICANS HURT IN BOMBING  Three American women were among 21 people injured when a suicide bomber set off explosives strapped to his body in the capital, Colombo. Two people died in the attack, presumed to have been carried out by the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Another suicide bomber nearly killed President Chandrika Kumaratunga on the same spot last Dec. 18.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: CABINET SWORN IN  President Chandrika Kumaratunga, left, swore in a large cabinet of more than 40 ministers at her official residence, retaining the most powerful portfolios -- finance and defense -- for herself. Her ruling coalition emerged from elections short of a parliamentary majority, and she handed out a raft of plum ministerial jobs to satisfy allies.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>IRAN: REFORMISTS CONDEMN COURT  Major reformist parties condemned a hard-line court controlled by the country's supreme leader in a sign of their increasing dissatisfaction with the slow pace of reforms. The Special Court for Clergy, instrumental in prosecuting reformist clergy, recently charged a progressive cleric with apostasy, spreading corruption and waging war on God, crimes that carry the death penalty. The Islamic Iran Participation Front said the court was unconstitutional and was used as a tool to eliminate opponents of the establishment.</p>
