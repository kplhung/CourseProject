        <p>The Internet auction giant eBay reported quarterly earnings yesterday that beat Wall Street's expectations and offered a sharp contrast to the recent high-technology gloom.</p>
        <p>The company reported $15.2 million in earnings for the quarter, or 5 cents a share, on revenue of $102.8 million from gross merchandise sales of $1.4 billion. The earnings were sharply higher than the $1.2 million, or 1 cent a share, for the quarter a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Analysts polled earlier in the day by First Call/Thomson Financial had suggested the company would earn 4 cents a share.</p>
        <p>The company promised more good news in the months ahead, with estimates of 2001 revenue of $630 million, about 50 percent higher than projections for this year. ''The best is yet to come,'' said Meg Whitman, the company's chief executive.</p>
        <p>In regular trading yesterday, eBay shares rose $3.81, to $57.19, on the Nasdaq in anticipation of good news. In after-hours trading following the earnings report, the stock jumped above $66.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the news showed that eBay's auction system was continuing to gain devotees, not only in the United States but overseas as well. ''Using eBay, buyers and sellers are able to meet for an almost endless stream of products around the world,'' said Derek Brown, an analyst with W. R. Hambrecht &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>In contrast to online retailers like Amazon, which have enormous costs of doing business, eBay's role as the online bazaar allows it to keep costs low. The company's warehouse is ''scattered around houses and basements around the globe,'' Mr. Brown said. ''That's the secret sauce.''</p>
        <p>An officer of the company, which is based in San Jose, Calif., attributed eBay's continued success to discipline.</p>
        <p>Rajiv Dutta, the vice president for finance, said eBay paid close, old-economy-style attention to profits even as other Internet companies disparaged profits in favor of growth and market share at any cost. Also, he said, ''We've been sort of incredibly lucky.''</p>
        <p>In addition to its transaction fees, the company said it would generate revenue by offering services accompanying those sales. In the case of cars, for example, the company hopes to cull extra income by connecting buyers with insurance, inspections, shipping and more.</p>
        <p>Another analyst, Timothy G. Fogarty of Thomas Wiesel Partners, said the company's prospects were are bright, but not unlimited. ''We still have to ask ourselves legitimate questions about what kind of valuations are justified,'' he said. ''You still have to inject some sanity.''</p>
        <p>TECHNOLOGY  Correction:  October 21, 2000, Saturday  An article in Business Day yesterday about the earnings of eBay, the Internet auctioneer, referred imprecisely to its revenues for the period ended Sept. 30. The figure of $102.8 million was for online operations; consolidated net revenues were $113.4 million.</p>
