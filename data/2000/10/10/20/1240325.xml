        <p>The creator of StarLink corn, Aventis CropScience, said it had dropped a deadline of today for farmers to sign up to sell the bioengineered corn back to the company. Aventis has also extended the buyback program to cover other corn crops grown within 660 feet of StarLink fields, some of which may have been fertilized by drifting StarLink pollen. In addition, according to Tom Miller, the Iowa attorney general, Aventis agreed this week that farmers can participate in the buyback without giving up their right to sue the company. Mr. Miller said Aventis had also agreed to pay for storage and transportation to approved distribution sites for corn that has become intermingled with the StarLink varieties. Aventis has been struggling to contain the StarLink corn, which is approved only for animal feed and industrial use, since reports last month that it had shown up in taco shells.</p>
