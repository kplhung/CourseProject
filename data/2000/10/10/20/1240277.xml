        <p>A federal jury has found the village of East Rockaway discriminated against one of its local businessmen because he rented apartments to minorities. The jury awarded the businessman, Robert Gunning of East Rockaway, $750,000 in compensation for violations of his constitutional right to equal protection and due process.</p>
        <p>In a verdict reached late Wednesday in United States District Court in Central Islip, jury found that the village, part of the Town of Hempstead, in Nassau County, , singled out Mr. Gunning because he rented apartments to blacks and other minorities.</p>
        <p>''They were literally trying to drive him out because of something he was doing, when it was not only his right, but it would be illegal for him to do otherwise,'' said Robert J. Valli Jr., one of Mr. Gunning's lawyers. According to testimony in the case, the village of about 10,000 people is at least 95 percent white.</p>
        <p>Rick Ostrove, another of Mr. Gunning's lawyers, said the verdict showed that people who rented to minorities -- and not just the minorities themselves -- are protected by the law. ''It is now a constitutional violation for a village to take action against one of its citizens for renting properties to minorities,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gunning's problems began in the early 1990's, Mr. Ostrove said, when he was renting some of his apartments to minorities. Mr. Gunning, who runs marinas and owns rental properties in Hempstead, said he rented to people who answered newspaper advertisements and could afford a security deposit and the first month's rent. The apartments, in a dozen single- or multi-family homes, rented for $1,000 to $1,400 a month, he said.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gunning realized that he did not have dock permits for one of his marinas, which had been in business for about 50 years, he applied to Hempstead for the permits. But the village of East Rockaway stalled in approving the permits. In 1994, it passed a law requiring marinas to provide one parking place for every boat slip, Mr. Ostrove said. At the time, Mr. Gunning operated the only marina in the village, according to the suit, and he was supposed to have been excused from the parking requirements because the marina had been in use before the law passed. The village did not give him that permission, and he was no longer able to run the marina.</p>
        <p>''He was forced to sell a number of his properties, and he lost the main marina,'' Mr. Ostrove said.</p>
        <p>According to the claim, members of the village board of trustees reportedly made remarks disparaging Mr. Gunning's renters, although during the trial, at least one trustee denied making such remarks.</p>
        <p>In the suit, Mr. Gunning said that village officials had denied his requests for sign permits and issued him summonses for violations of various ordinances that were not equally enforced against other property owners. Mr. Ostrove said there were 15 to 20 such violations, for example, for not taking in garbage cans early enough in the day.</p>
        <p>In a press release issued today, East Rockaway denied any wrongdoing in connection with the case, saying, ''The village believes that the verdict was in error and is taking steps by its attorneys to move to set aside the verdict and proceed with an appeal if the applications to set aside the verdict are not granted.''</p>
        <p>Milton Thurm, a lawyer who represented East Rockaway in the trial, said the jury may have been swayed when Mr. Gunning broke down and cried on the stand.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there was any intent on the part of the village to discriminate against this gentlemen,'' Mr. Thurm said. He said the village might fight the verdict because it was not clear that Mr. Gunning was entitled to the permit for the marina or that he had actually applied for it.</p>
