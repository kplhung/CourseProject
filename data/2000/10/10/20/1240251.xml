        <p>A Candid Return  From the Edge</p>
        <p>It was another award ceremony in a hotel ballroom -- this time, in Albany, where SOL WACHTLER once presided over the state's highest court. Mr. Wachtler was on the podium again, giving a speech to -- and receiving an award from -- the Mental Health Association in New York State, a network of 32 local mental health groups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wachtler resigned from the court after he was arrested, in 1992, for a campaign of harassment against a woman with whom he had had an affair. At the time, he attributed his behavior to depression and dependence on prescription drugs. He served nearly a year in federal prison.</p>
        <p>How did Mr. Wachtler become involved with the association?</p>
        <p>''The short version,'' said JOE GLAZER, the association's chief executive, ''is, three years ago, after reading Sol Wachtler's book, I sent him a letter congratulating him on his candor and his recovery. Since then, he has helped us, quietly, deal with issues such as outpatient commitment, consumer protection and right to counsel that without his assistance we would not have been able to frame so that they ended up being a part of a law.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Wachtler's speech, it centered on problems that mentally ill inmates face.</p>
        <p>''When you talk to the judge, he will tell you his credibility is diminished,'' Mr. Glazer said. ''But in the world of mental illness, his credibility is enhanced every time he stands in front of the microphone.''</p>
        <p>Stamped Approved</p>
        <p>There was no sleight of hand involved: 16 stamps bearing the magician DAVID COPPERFIELD'S picture were issued yesterday. First there was a ceremony at Grand Central Terminal. Later he showed off the stamps -- four each from St. Vincent and the Grenadines; Nevis; the Commonwealth of Dominica; and Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique -- while sitting on the terrace above his triplex apartment on the East Side. Money from the stamps will go to a nonprofit foundation he set up to teach magic as therapy in hospitals.</p>
        <p>Eventually it was time for a visitor to do a disappearing act and go back to the office.  But there was a problem: Mr. Copperfield could not unlock the door leading to the staircase they had come in by. The trick turned out to be a second, secret staircase, beyond Mr. Copperfield's swimming pool.</p>
        <p>Where's the Dow?</p>
        <p>The traders had limped off the floor after a day on which the Dow Jones industrials had lost 149 points. Now it was evening, time for the history people to gather at the New York Stock Exchange, a stop in the new book ''Touring Lower Manhattan: Three Walks in New York's Historic Downtown'' by ANDREW S. DOLKART and STEVEN WHEELER.</p>
        <p>There were those who asked, ''Where's MARIA BARTIROMO?'' and ''Where's KATHLEEN HAYS?'' -- referring to two CNBC correspondents who broadcast from the exchange -- and ''Where's PEG BREEN?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bartiromo and Ms. Hays had long since left the CNBC set. Ms. Breen -- the president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, a nonprofit group that published the book -- was on the floor. She was chatting about the exchange's new building with VISHAAN P. CHAKRABARTI, an associate partner at Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill.</p>
        <p>''We're still drawing,'' Mr. Chakrabarti said, predicting that the project would be finished in 2006. Ms. Breen added, with approval, ''They're keeping this building.''</p>
        <p>It was probably just as well that no one asked, ''Where's RICHARD PIEPER?'' Mr. Pieper, an architectural preservationist, had trouble at the checkpoint in the lobby -- and his name was on the guest list. He said that he had been teaching a metals-conservation class at Columbia University before heading for the party and was carrying a suitcase full of metal samples, which created problems for the guards.</p>
        <p>''The funniest part was when they X-rayed it,'' he said after he was finally admitted to the party. ''The guard asked, 'Sir, do you mind telling me what's in this box?' I held the box out to him to open and he recoiled. I wish you could have seen his face.''</p>
