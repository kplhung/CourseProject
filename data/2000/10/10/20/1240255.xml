        <p>After the first day of the Presidents Cup, the United States had all the momentum and the International Team had none of the points.</p>
        <p>What happened today at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club was stunning, the best possible start for the Americans, and a worst-case scenario for their opponents. Sweeping all foursome matches, and threatening to turn the biennial competition into a rout, the Americans took a 5-0 lead into Friday's action, leaving the International Team in danger of having the cup snatched away in embarrassing fashion.</p>
        <p>It was the first time since the Americans swept the four-ball in 1994 that a team had jumped to a 5-0 lead.</p>
        <p>''We're going to have to do something quick if we're going to make a match out of this,'' said Nick Price of South Africa, standing by the 18th green just moments after losing the match that completed the sweep. ''We got whitewashed today. If we don't get some points tomorrow, it's going to be a very anticlimactic Saturday and Sunday.''</p>
        <p>On Friday there will be five morning four-ball matches followed by five afternoon foursome matches. The first team to 16 1/2 points wins the cup.</p>
        <p>Two years ago in Melbourne, Australia, the International Team romped to a 20 1/2-11 1/2 victory, and the Americans were criticized for being an individualistic squad that played without passion.</p>
        <p>But everything changed last year at the Ryder Cup in Brookline, Mass., when the United States pulled off an incredible Sunday comeback, rallying from a 10-6 deficit to defeat Europe.</p>
        <p>Seven players from last year's Ryder Cup team form the nucleus of this year's Presidents Cup team -- Tiger Woods, David Duval, Phil Mickelson, Davis Love III, Hal Sutton, Tom Lehman and Jim Furyk All of those players won today.</p>
        <p>''Brookline did a lot for us as a team,'' said Lehman, who teamed with Mickelson to ambush Steve Elkington and Greg Norman, 5 &amp; 4 in the opening match, setting the tone for the day. ''Momentum is a big deal in sports, and there's no doubt that there has been some carry-over. As a group, we have a lot of belief in ourselves.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the International Team could hardly believe what took place. Norman and Elkington started horrendously, falling 6 down after just eight holes. When the rest of the International Team saw two of its leaders being pummeled so early, doubt seemed to creep through.</p>
        <p>''That was pretty much the idea,'' Mickelson said. ''If we could start off the right way, not only winning a point, but winning decisively, we felt we'd give our team confidence. That was the purpose, to get the entire team in the mind-set of winning.''</p>
        <p>And win the Americans did. Stewart Cink and Kirk Triplett, Presidents Cup rookies, won handily over Mike Weir and Retief Goosen, 3 &amp; 2, but the other three matches went to the final hole.</p>
        <p>The marquee match was the 1-up victory by Woods and Notah Begay III over Vijay Singh and Ernie Els. Typically, Woods made a huge pressure putt in the match -- a 20-footer on No. 16 to save par and to keep Woods and Begay 1 up with two holes to play.</p>
        <p>How confident was Woods about that putt? Before he made it, he told Begay that the putt was going in.</p>
        <p>''I had such a good feeling I could bury it,'' said Woods, who pumped his fist with enthusiasm after the ball fell into the cup.</p>
        <p>Els and Singh never caught up, and things went from bad to worse for the International Team. Sutton and Furyk never trailed, defeating Robert Allenby and Stuart Appleby, 1 up, and the sweep was completed when Duval and Love took a 2-up lead after 15 holes, then hung on to defeat Price and Carlos Franco, 1 up. The International Team never seemed to adjust to the speed of the quick greens, blowing crucial putts past the hole and losing opportunities to catch up.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the International Team captain, Peter Thomson, left himself open for criticism by not playing Shigeki Maruyama today. Maruyama was 5-0 at the 1998 Presidents Cup. Thomson announced that he would include Maruyama in the Friday morning lineup, while separating Norman and Elkington.</p>
        <p>When the Americans jumped to a 4-1 lead in 1996, the International Team rallied before losing 16 1/2-15 1/2. But after today's start, the Americans vowed not to let up.</p>
        <p>''You look at their team, and you'd never predict we'd be up 5-0,'' Duval said. ''I think we'll come out the same way tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>DAVID DUVAL broke his 7-iron on the second hole, forcing him to use a replacement that someone retrieved from the clubhouse. Duval only took one shot with the substitute club, but he hit the green with it. A new 7-iron was being shipped to Duval tonight.</p>
