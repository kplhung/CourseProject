        <p>A great Subway Series, or any kind of series, requires great enmity.

        <p>WHERE is the hate?</p>
        <p>A great Subway Series, or any kind of series, requires great enmity. You need ancient tribal rivalries: Brooklyn versus Manhattan, Gotham versus Beantown, the South Side of Chicago versus the North Side. But when it comes to the Yankees and the Mets, most New Yorkers don't even care enough to take sides.</p>
        <p>Even Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was nearly martyred by his Dodger enemies during the original Subway Series era, is going soft. Today he presides over a bipartisan rally. He has already promised a post-series parade for both teams, which utterly misses the emotional essence of the parade.</p>
        <p>Riding up Broadway's Canyon of Heroes is our version of the ancient Roman ritual called a triumph, in which a victorious general would enter the city on a gilded chariot. He would ride to the Capitol accompanied by relatives, soldiers, senators, booty from the conquered and placards saluting his victory. Some losing soldiers were invited, but they were dragged in chains and showered with spit, not confetti. When the parade reached the Capitol, they were executed. Bipartisanship was not the order of the day.</p>
        <p>Times change, and today's paradegoers may not care to see Mike Piazza going up Broadway in chains, or Derek Jeter executed at City Hall. Fine. We could have a perfectly acceptable parade without saliva or bloodshed. But it needs to be animated by some visceral chauvinism: Our men have conquered! Our homes are safe! The barbarians have been routed!</p>
        <p>For most New Yorkers, the barbarians have already been routed, since our teams beat everyone else, so what's the point of the series? If Aida had shared the spirit of today's rally in Bryant Park, her famous aria to the troops going into battle, ''Ritorna vincitor!'' (''Return victors!''), would have been: ''Hey guys, there are no losers in this war.''</p>
        <p>Where has all the hatred gone? Some Met fans loathe the Yankees, but they're a distinct minority. A New York Times/CBS News poll in the city and suburbs last year found that the most typical baseball fans -- 34 percent of those polled -- root for both teams. An additional 21 percent said they root for neither.</p>
        <p>Less than half of those polled expressed a preference for one team: 16 percent for the Mets, 28 percent for the Yankees (and most of those Yankee fans probably didn't care enough about the Mets to hate them). The poll also found no socioeconomic differences between the teams' fans worth fighting about. There are geographic differences, but again nothing to stir the blood. The Yankees draw more fans from Manhattan, the Bronx and New Jersey, while the Mets draw more from the other boroughs and Long Island, but they both draw fans from all over.</p>
        <p>DURING the last Subway Series, the team boundaries were clear enough to inspire a lynch mob, as Mr. Giuliani likes to recall. His father, who had moved from Yankee territory in East Harlem to his wife's neighborhood in Brooklyn, sent young Rudy out in a Yankee uniform, whereupon some Dodger fans put a noose around his neck and were about to hang him when his grandmother intervened.</p>
        <p>Today it's hard to imagine any boys caring enough to hang a rival fan, even if there were another young Rudy out there. The Mets are not integral to any place's identity the way the Dodgers were to Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Today's Subway Series would be nastier if the Dodgers were still around, but the rivalry probably would have ebbed anyway. The old interborough differences would have mattered less as fans scattered to the suburbs and television created one large metropolitan market. Chicago still has its two original teams in place -- Cubs on the North Side, White Sox on the South Side -- but even there the animosity has subsided.</p>
        <p>''The fans are not quite as divided,'' said Richard Babcock, the editor of Chicago magazine. ''When I was growing up north of the city, I was genetically incapable of rooting for the Sox, but now I go to an occasional Sox game. You still see a split between Cub fans and White Sox fans, but it's like two tribes who can't quite remember anymore why they're supposed to hate each other.''</p>
        <p>If there is to be any hope of reviving hatred here, the teams would have to stand for something different. Maybe they could divide up demographically -- smokers versus nonsmokers, or recyclers versus nonrecyclers, or car alarm owners versus decent people. Maybe one of the teams could move to Jersey. But for this series, the awful question remains: Can't we all not get along?</p>
