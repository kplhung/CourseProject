        <p>This Sunday's presentation of PBS's ''Nature'' series opens with the image of Julia Roberts sitting in a bureaucrat's office in Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, while arrangements are made for her trip into the country's heartland. She has arrived in this remote nation north of China because she loves horses, she says. Montana, apparently, just wouldn't do.</p>
        <p>Without referring to her status as the most bankable female movie star in Hollywood, Ms. Roberts wonders about the Mongolians, ''What will they make of me, a girl from New York?''</p>
        <p>Non-Mongolians may feel equally flummoxed, if they happen on this bizarre hour of television. In ''Wild Horses of Mongolia With Julia Roberts,'' the movie star briefly takes up residence in a Mongolian family's spare ''ger,'' a local term for a portable structure of wood and canvas that resembles a round tent (which foreigners refer to as a yurt). She positions herself fetchingly on the Mongolian steppes and becomes an incongruous spot of glamour against the stark stretches of breathtaking nothingness. She drinks fermented mare's milk and then learns how to milk a horse (a valuable alternative skill for the future, when she no longer commands $15 million to $20 million a picture).</p>
        <p>''Nature'' began sending celebrities into the wild in 1993 when Timothy Dalton decided he didn't just want to narrate a documentary about wolves, he wanted to meet some wolves face to face. After that, no species was safe from Hollywood. Goldie Hawn trekked after elephants in India, Robin Williams frolicked with dolphins, and Whoopi Goldberg went to the zoo.</p>
        <p>This is Ms. Roberts's second outing for PBS, following up on her 1998 session with orangutans. Here, however, her equine interest is frequently diverted by her fascination with the culture and politics of the Mongolian people as they emerge from Communist rule.</p>
        <p>After spending some time with her cheerful-seeming and gracious Mongolian hosts, people dressed in bright clothing, she says of these descendants of Genghis Khan: ''There is a sense of happiness that seems to permeate everything.'' This romantic vision of hardscrabble nomadic life may have been helped along by her inability to speak Mongolian and her hosts' lack of English -- and by the knowledge that she will leave her ger soon enough and return to a world with bathrooms.</p>
        <p>(Ms. Roberts isn't the only one interested in Mongolia these days. The American Museum of Natural History currently has two Mongolia shows, ''Fighting Dinosaurs: New Discoveries From Mongolia'' and ''Mongolia Observed: Photographs Present and Past.'' The semi-nomadic Xiongnu Empire of Inner Mongolia is featured in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's ''Year One: Art of the Ancient World East and West.'' This summer Asia House presented an exhibition of the ceremonial masks of Mongolia.)</p>
        <p>The documentary captures the bleak landscape and the exotic drama of the nomads, who fold their gers and move whenever water runs out, which happens quickly in this parched terrain. The pre-winter light is exquisite, so Ms. Roberts manages to look fabulous even as she complains that her feet felt like blocks of ice during the night. As you might expect, gers have no central heating.</p>
        <p>The program's many contrivances are sometimes amusing and often puzzling. Ms. Roberts seems to have removed herself to the middle of nowhere, yet suddenly a man rides by in a motorcycle. She lives in one ger and her hosts in another, but where is the camera crew staying? Did her hosts have any idea who she was? Had they ever seen a movie?</p>
        <p>These questions come to mind because the focus is more on anthropology than nature, and the feeling is more fairy tale than factual (though Ms. Roberts dispenses much information). The horses are consistently upstaged by the people, even during the climactic horse race displaying the fierce grandeur of these wild animals. The jockeys, who are cute Mongolian children, are much more compelling than the stocky, spiky-maned Mongolian horses.</p>
        <p>Eventually Ms. Roberts does climb into the saddle and becomes positively Zen, perhaps in homage to her temporarily adoptive country's resurgent interest in Buddhism. She observes that the ''grass is never greener on the other side of the fence because there are no fences.'' (There's also no sign of green grass.)</p>
        <p>After hopping onto the big military-style truck that has come to take her home, Ms. Roberts says solemnly, ''There's a lot we can learn from Mongolia.'' And where else but on television would the lesson be delivered quite like this?</p>
        <p>SONGS IN ORDINARY TIME  CBS, Sunday night at 9  (Channel 2 in New York)</p>
        <p>The ''CBS Sunday Movie'' adaptation of ''Songs in Ordinary Time'' squeezes Mary McGarry Morris's 740-page best-selling novel into a couple of hours. Though Rod Holcomb's direction and Malcolm Macrury's screenplay are serious and straightforward and the actors do their work well, this is more than enough time to spend with these sour, self-pitying characters.</p>
        <p>Set in a small Vermont town in 1961, ''Songs'' tells the story of Marie Fermoyle (Sissy Spacek), a secretary in the local factory and the mother of three children. This is not a friendly little town but a mean gossipy place, so Marie the earnest matron is still regarded as a bad girl because she ''had'' to get married 17 years earlier. Her ex-husband is a bothersome drunk and her children treat her with disdain, except for her youngest son, Benjy, who adores her.</p>
        <p>When a dangerous con man (Beau Bridges) comes to town, Marie becomes his dupe while the town assumes a unified sneer and waits for disaster -- which arrives on cue.</p>
        <p>NATURE  Wild Horses of Mongolia With Julia Roberts  PBS, Sunday night  (Channel 13, New York, at 8)</p>
        <p>Produced by Andrew Jackson and directed by Nigel Cole. A co-production of Tigress Productions and Thirteen/WNET New York. Jeremy Bradshaw and Charles Brand, executive producers. Fred Kaufman, executive producer for Nature. Presented and narrated by Julia Roberts.</p>
