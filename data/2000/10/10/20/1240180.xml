        <p>The charismatic, predatory stranger who through sexual manipulation and bullying takes over a household in which he's either a guest or a servant is a ready-made metaphor for class struggle that the movies have plied for decades. Raw working-class ambition trumps aristocratic ''decadence'' every time. Jon Reiss's film, ''Cleopatra's Second Husband,'' might be described as an American yuppie variation on the theme, even though the class distinctions are blurred.</p>
        <p>In this version Robert Marrs (Paul Hipp), a sulky young gentleman of leisure, and his nagging wife, Hallie (Bitty Schram), rent their sumptuous Los Angeles house to Zack Taylor (Boyd Kestner) and his girlfriend, Sophie (Radha Mitchell). The sexy, mysterious housesitters, new in town, have been recommended to the Marrses by friends of friends.</p>

        <p>The charismatic, predatory stranger who through sexual manipulation and bullying takes over a household in which he's either a guest or a servant is a ready-made metaphor for class struggle that the movies have plied for decades. Raw working-class ambition trumps aristocratic ''decadence'' every time. Jon Reiss's film, ''Cleopatra's Second Husband,'' might be described as an American yuppie variation on the theme, even though the class distinctions are blurred.</p>
        <p>In this version Robert Marrs (Paul Hipp), a sulky young gentleman of leisure, and his nagging wife, Hallie (Bitty Schram), rent their sumptuous Los Angeles house to Zack Taylor (Boyd Kestner) and his girlfriend, Sophie (Radha Mitchell). The sexy, mysterious housesitters, new in town, have been recommended to the Marrses by friends of friends.</p>
        <p>If the Marrses are connoisseurs of the good life, there is nothing going on beneath the surface. Robert is a spineless, morbid art photographer who specializes in taking pictures of maggot-encrusted roadkill. Hallie, a compulsive whiner, never stops complaining and baiting her husband, who feigns indifference to her nastiness. It takes this couple less than 15 minutes of screen time to make us despise them.</p>
        <p>But when the Marrses, dissatisfied with their vacation cottage, decide to return home early, they discover that Robert's beloved tropical fish have somehow died in their tank. Despite this ominous sign, they allow Zack and Sophie to stay on for a few more days when the visitors protest that they have nowhere else to go. All Zack and Sophie ever seem to do is have hot, noisy sex (often with the door left ajar) that contrasts with the pallid, rigidly scheduled couplings of the Marrses, who are trying to have a baby.</p>
        <p>When Sophie signals her availability to the passive-aggressive Robert, he seizes his opportunity and makes only a token attempt to conceal his infidelity. Hallie, on learning that Robert has cheated, goes ballistic and walks out. Robert becomes his guests' cook and servant, surrendering the master bedroom to them along with his credit cards and sinking into a depressive silence.</p>
        <p>Once Sophie departs, the sadomasochistic games really begin. Zack rapes Robert and beats him up during their one-on-one basketball contests. Just when Robert seems to have turned into an inert emotional vegetable, he hatches a horrifying revenge that Zack implausibly fails to sense.</p>
        <p>''Cleopatra's Second Husband,'' which opens today at the Screening Room, is well acted, but it doesn't enrich its metaphor beyond giving an old story a sour contemporary resonance. The problem is that the characters are so dislikable that not much seems to be at stake. Zack and Sophie may be monsters, but they exhibit a vitality that the selfish, shallow Marrses lack.</p>
        <p>If the movie's ominous cat-and-mouse games titillate, its broader message seems to be a too-familiar one: that behind the facade of yuppie affluence and refined taste fester a fatal apathy and spiritual rot.</p>
        <p>The movie is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, sexual situations and violence.</p>
