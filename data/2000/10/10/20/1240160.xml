        <p>Meet the Parents  Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo  Directed by Jay Roach  PG-13 105 minutes</p>
        <p>Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) has a few things to keep in mind when visiting Jack Byrnes (Mr. De Niro), his prospective father-in-law, in leafiest suburbia. Jack considers smoking a weakness, so stash the cigarettes and go to the drugstore for some nicotine patches. Jack's cat has lost its defense skills, so never let it out of the house. Do not flush the downstairs toilet; it floods. At home in Chicago you regularly make love to Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo), Jack's extremely beloved elder daughter, but do not do so under her father's roof. As Jack puts it: his way or the Long Island Expressway.</p>

        <p>Meet the Parents  Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo  Directed by Jay Roach  PG-13 105 minutes</p>
        <p>Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) has a few things to keep in mind when visiting Jack Byrnes (Mr. De Niro), his prospective father-in-law, in leafiest suburbia. Jack considers smoking a weakness, so stash the cigarettes and go to the drugstore for some nicotine patches. Jack's cat has lost its defense skills, so never let it out of the house. Do not flush the downstairs toilet; it floods. At home in Chicago you regularly make love to Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo), Jack's extremely beloved elder daughter, but do not do so under her father's roof. As Jack puts it: his way or the Long Island Expressway.</p>
        <p>With the rules established early, Greg unintentionally breaks nearly all of them and many others during a weekend intended to introduce the Byrneses to the young man who, if he can possibly survive the obsessively judgmental and intrusive Jack, may well join the family. A fire breaks out; a septic tank erupts; the cat vamooses. The one rule Greg would like to break -- no sex with Pam -- is upheld by Jack, who has a knack of bursting upon the scene at exactly the right moment.</p>
        <p>Jack, in fact, is a trained spy, a former C.I.A. man who now sells surveillance devices. Greg is a nurse, much to the amusement of Jack and  Dina (Ms. Danner), Pam's mother, whose younger daughter is about to marry a doctor. But Greg is also a resilient city boy who suggests to Jack that Puff the magic dragon might not really be a creature who lives by the sea. Is there a way out of this disaster?</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE -- Greg accidentally bloodies Pam's sister during a water polo game. Otherwise there is some comic banging about.</p>
        <p>SEX -- Not with Jack around, but he does turn up some sex toys in what he presumes is Greg's luggage.</p>
        <p>PROFANITY -- Not a whole lot, but some.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>UNDER AGE 11 -- No great harm would be done, but the film has nothing to attract young children.</p>
        <p>AGES 11 AND UP -- Mr. Stiller and Mr. De Niro are very funny together. Some children won't relate, but most will have some laughs.</p>
        <p>Whispers:  An Elephant's Tale  With the voices of Angela Bassett, Anne Archer, Debi Derryberry  Directed by Dereck Joubert  G 72 minutes</p>
        <p>The father doesn't stay around for his son's birth, but that's O.K. They're elephants. Shortly after little Whispers (380 pounds) wobbles to his feet, his mother gets lost in a panicked rush away from ''takers,'' or hunters, who blast away at the herd. Separated from his mother, the little one attaches himself to elephants who don't want anything to do with him.</p>
        <p>Realize that these are real elephants, some trained but most of them wild, filmed by Mr. Joubert and his wife, Beverly, in and around the Chobe National Park in Botswana. ''Elephants actually do communicate,'' Ms. Joubert says in the film's publicity materials. ''What we did is interpret their talk and put it into the English language.'' And in English they talk in the same sappy cliches as humans, especially movie humans putting on sing-song voices in trying to be elephants.</p>
        <p>In the main, they keep telling one another to hurry. After an intragroup squabble, a female called Groove goes off by herself. Still looking for a guardian, Whispers follows. Groove gripes about this, but the pair endure lion attacks, assaults by hunters and other perils together. That makes them a team. Whispers learns to trumpet and becomes a hero. And they have terrific sunsets in Botswana.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE -- It's been almost 50 years since American childhood was traumatized by the shooting of Bambi's mother. ''Whispers'' is no ''Bambi,'' and the lions do more damage than the hunters, but several attack scenes (a couple of them quite spectacular) could frighten young children.</p>
        <p>SEX -- None.</p>
        <p>PROFANITY -- None.</p>
        <p>FOOTNOTE -- The animal photography -- lions leaping onto elephants' backs in the dead of night and the like -- is superb and startling. Too bad they have to talk.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>AGES 3-6 -- Again, the lions and the loss of Whispers's mother could upset them. On the plus side, there is the steady drumbeat of love of family, courage under duress and loyalty to friends.</p>
        <p>AGES 7-10 -- Fine.</p>
        <p>Lost Souls  Winona Ryder, Ben Chaplin, John Hurt, Philip Baker Hall, Elias Koteas  Directed by Janusz Kaminski  R 102 minutes</p>
        <p>What will you be doing tomorrow afternoon at 4:55? If you're Peter Kelson (Mr. Chaplin), you'll be transforming into Satan himself. At the exact moment he turns 33, Kelson, a cocksure, best-selling crime writer, will go to the devil. Or so it is believed by Maya (Ms. Ryder), who has been rescued from demonic possession herself by a team of Catholic priests dedicated to keeping Satan where he belongs, down below.</p>
        <p>Maya's mission, should she accept it (just try to stop her), is to save  Kelson and mankind from the ultimate darkness. At first Kelson dismisses all this, as do his smooth blond girlfriend (Sarah Wynter) and his own mentor in the clergy, a slightly oily priest named Father James (Mr. Hall), whom he has known since childhood. But then a troubling sign starts to crop up: the letters XES. His friends note that XES is nothing more than sex spelled backward. But Maya tells him that he'd better snap out of his ''malignant narcissism'' and realize that XES are also Greek numbers and signs of the devil.</p>
        <p>Several timber-rattling supernatural events later, Kelson has come around to Maya's way of thinking.  But now he he has reason to doubt his own family. With no time left, Maya has only one course of action.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE -- A man's neck is broken (loudly); a botched exorcism gets out of hand and leaves some human wreckage along with cracked plaster, broken windows and a burst sprinkler system; and there are other scattered violent incidents.</p>
        <p>SEX -- None, though Ms. Ryder's Maya is plenty sexy.</p>
        <p>PROFANITY -- Quite a bit, as might be expected under the circumstances.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>UNDER AGE 14 -- Keep in mind that the R rating requires an accompanying adult. This is one of those films that may not be entirely out of the question for young teenagers, but it is a parental decision.</p>
        <p>AGES 14 AND UP -- Forgive us this transgression, but this is really quite a funny film -- not that it means to be. In fact, many teenagers will think it's a hoot. Again, parents be advised.</p>
