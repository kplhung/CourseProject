      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Vice Pres Al Gore, in final debate with Gov George W Bush, hammered away at Bush's tax giveaway to rich; notes that low- and middle-income Americans pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes, and payroll taxes would not be cut under Bush plan; notes also that Gore forced Bush to acknowledge that his partial privatization of Social Security would divert $1 trillion from surplus into private accounts, siphoning off funds that will be needed in future to pay benefits to retirees</p>

        <p>Both presidential candidates used their final debate this week to set up their stretch drives to the election. Gov. George W. Bush proclaimed himself the cure for partisan bickering in Washington and painted Vice President Al Gore as a big-spending, big-government liberal. But Mr. Gore came away with two overriding issues to exploit in the closing weeks. He hammered away at Mr. Bush's tax giveaway to the rich, and he forced Mr. Bush to acknowledge that his partial privatization of Social Security would divert $1 trillion from the surplus into private accounts, siphoning off funds that will be needed in the future to pay benefits to retirees.</p>
        <p>Federal spending. Governor Bush distorted reality when he said that Mr. Gore's campaign proposals added up to ''the largest increase in federal spending in years.'' The Bush campaign cited figures this week to show that the Gore program would raise federal spending, in terms of dollars, by more than at any time since the Great Society program of the 1960's. But that is a misleading measure. President Johnson's programs raised federal spending as a percentage of national income, from 17 to over 21 percent. The Gore program would head in the opposite direction. Federal spending as a percentage of national income would fall, from about 18 percent to less than 17.5 percent by 2010, the lowest level since the mid-1960's. That can hardly be described as big government run amok.</p>

        <p>Federal spending. Governor Bush distorted reality when he said that Mr. Gore's campaign proposals added up to ''the largest increase in federal spending in years.'' The Bush campaign cited figures this week to show that the Gore program would raise federal spending, in terms of dollars, by more than at any time since the Great Society program of the 1960's. But that is a misleading measure. President Johnson's programs raised federal spending as a percentage of national income, from 17 to over 21 percent. The Gore program would head in the opposite direction. Federal spending as a percentage of national income would fall, from about 18 percent to less than 17.5 percent by 2010, the lowest level since the mid-1960's. That can hardly be described as big government run amok.</p>
        <p>Tax cuts. Mr. Gore made it clear that he would continue to pound Mr. Bush for proposing tax cuts that would primarily benefit the richest 1 percent of the American population. Mr. Bush tried to parry the thrust by saying that the share of taxes paid by wealthy families would actually rise under his plan, to 64 percent from 62 percent. But his figures apply only to income taxes. Low- and many middle-income families pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes, and payroll taxes would not be cut a dime under the Bush plan. Mr. Bush also calls for gutting the estate tax, which is paid almost entirely by the richest families. So even if wealthy families pay a slightly larger fraction of income taxes under the Bush plan, they will pay a lower share of all federal taxes.</p>
        <p>Social Security. The vice president sounded an important theme when he accused Mr. Bush of financial legerdemain -- promising to use $1 trillion to set up private retirement accounts while needing to use the same dollars to pay current retirees. Mr. Gore's accusation applies more to the future than to the present. For the next few years, Social Security will run huge surpluses, providing enough money to create private accounts and to pay retirees. But those surpluses are temporary, and eventually Mr. Bush must find dollars to serve both purposes. Indeed, to make his program work he will be forced to cut benefits well below current guarantees, raise taxes or borrow, an issue he refuses to confront.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush wants to create the private retirement accounts alongside the existing public trust fund by diverting, say, a sixth of the current Social Security payroll tax. He defends the idea by saying that workers currently get only a ''paltry'' 2 percent return -- in terms of future retirement benefits -- on the money they pay in payroll taxes. But, he says, they could easily earn at least twice as much on private accounts invested in stocks and bonds. The comparison is highly misleading.</p>
        <p>More than 80 percent of the payroll taxes that workers pay into the common trust fund fly right back out to pay the benefits of current retirees. This money is never invested, earning a zero rate of return. The problem is that Social Security has promised to pay trillions of dollars to retirees in excess of taxes the system expects to collect in future years. These unfunded promises will not disappear under partial privatization. One way or another, taxpayers will foot the bill, making the private accounts far less attractive than Mr. Bush advertises.</p>
        <p>Some estimates suggest that over the next 75 years or more, retirees will not come out ahead, and the ones who are unlucky in their private account investments could come out well behind.</p>
