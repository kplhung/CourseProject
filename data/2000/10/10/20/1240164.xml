        <p>A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend.

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>''AMAZONS OF THE AVANT-GARDE,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If only a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibition still isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems, if anything, more remarkable, not less, for having as little to do with sex as it does and almost everything to do with painting. Many of the works have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).</p>

        <p>''AMAZONS OF THE AVANT-GARDE,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7).

        <p>''A BRUSH WITH NATURE: THE GERE COLLECTION OF LANDSCAPE OIL SKETCHES,'' Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Nov. 12). Most of the artists in this show -- English, French, Italian, German, Belgian and Scandinavian, from the 17th to the 19th centuries -- are barely known today. In their own age they did something quite offbeat: they left studios to paint outdoors, registering transient moments of light and atmosphere by sketching quickly in oil from nature. Until recently it was assumed that this plein-air approach, used to train hand and eye for more ambitious compositions, began with the Impressionists. These canvases today are sought-after prizes. The 68 on view here were assembled by a pioneering scholar and collector in the field, John Gere (1921-1995), former Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, and his wife, Charlotte. Mostly painted in Rome and the surrounding countryside, they capture such painterly events as the seamed face of a rock, the rush of water through a valley, the play of sunlight on a ruin, the quirky architecture of a building or a wall. Tune your eye to small when you look at this show, and you'll find it a treasure. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; $5 for students (over 10) and the elderly (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''THE EMBODIED IMAGE: CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY FROM THE JOHN B. ELLIOTT COLLECTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 7). In China the written word has traditionally been the highest art form and a source of political and emotional power. To see that power in action, check out this grandly scaled exhibition, which brings together two superb calligraphy collections -- from Princeton University and the Met -- in the most comprehensive survey yet seen in these parts. The dozens of scrolls covered with hand-written words collectively radiate a kind of conversational buzz and suggest a richly varied cast of personalities: fastidious court functionaries, impulsive social agitators, unworldly monks, visionary poets. Together they offer an ice-breaking introduction to an art that can all too easily seem, to non-Chinese speakers, unapproachable. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>''AN ENGAGEMENT WITH FOLK ART: CYRIL I. NELSON'S GIFTS TO THE MUSEUM OF AMERICAN FOLK ART,'' 2 Lincoln Square, at West 66th Street, (212) 595-9533 (through Jan. 7). This show celebrates the largesse of Mr. Nelson, a book editor and folk art collector, who has given 113 objects to the museum with the promise of more. The works, from the late-18th to the mid-20th centuries, cover the traditional areas of folk art -- portraits, landscapes, sculptures, painted and decorated furniture -- but the focus is on American needlework: quilts, coverlets, blankets and the like. Among the quilt spectaculars is the ''Samuel Steinberger Log Cabin Quilt, Courthouse Steps Variation,'' by a 19th-century immigrant. Painted furniture, too, shines in this show. The painting and sculpture pieces make a more modest impression, but overall, what's on view represents a refined, solid ensemble that is very visitable. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''IN THE PRESENCE OF SPIRITS,'' African Art From the National Museum of Ethnology in Lisbon, Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Dec. 31). Shown in quantity for the first time in the United States, this collection from the former Portuguese colonies of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau was assembled by the Portuguese government, starting in the 1960's. The more than 140 objects on view relate to the secular and the supernatural in African culture: masks, power figures, dolls, decorated stools and chairs, pipes, posts and other artifacts. Outstanding is a group of initiation masks made from wood and more fragile materials like feathers, fabrics and barkcloth fibers; ranging from fierce to benign in expression, they are giddily imaginative. Impressive, too, is a selection of dolls, important in the socialization of girls, from the Ambo people of southwestern Angola. The objects in the show were chosen for their high aesthetic value, and it doesn't disappoint. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for children, students and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>LEE KRASNER, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 7). Despite its restless energy and moments of formal power and elegance, Lee Krasner's career in this economical retrospective looks more like one of tantalizing frustration than real fulfillment. In the 1950's and early 60's, Krasner painted splattery, ambitious Abstract Expressionist works, but they look indebted to other artists, Pollock and de Kooning mainly. Where she looks most herself is in collage; a set of large collages on canvas from the early 50's have raw density or explosive buoyancy. Collages made in the 1970's using 40-year-old charcoal drawings have a beautiful Cubistic elegance; they are the best works of her career. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month); Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>''OPEN ENDS,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Jan. 2). The third and final cycle of ''MOMA 2000,'' the year-and-a-half-long, millennium-marking rethinking of the Modern's permanent collection, is off and running, with the first of three staggered floor-through sections in place. The dates covered are 1960 to the present, so there's some sense of how a bastion of modernism is dealing with a postmodern world. Pretty well, judging from recent acquisitions of work by Pipilotti Rist, Matthew Barney and Cai Guo-Qiang. The real interest, though, is in smart theme shows that play with such contemporary fixations as childhood innocence and adult experience, and the blend of art, abjection and design. (The third-floor galleries open on Nov. 5.) Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''PIERRE ET GILLES,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Jan. 7). No history of postmodern photography, fashion photography, celebrity portraiture, record album covers or the highbrow beefcake tradition would be complete without the work of the French photo team known as Pierre et Gilles, who have collaborated on over-the-top, tightly styled, hand-finished photographs since 1976 and become wildly famous in Europe in the process. In their first American museum retrospective, their work feels more than a little embalmed, existing behind a not-so-invisible shield of artistic conservatism. Certain images come to life as art objects -- most notably, one of a beautiful young sailor up to his chest in water with an iridescent night sky behind him -- but those  are few. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, until 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students, artists and the elderly (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>* BRIDGET RILEY, ''Reconnaissance,'' Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through June 17). Once overly identified with Op Art, this British abstract painter never got her due in anti-Op New York, but this beautifully installed show of 40 paintings from 1961 to 1984 should change things. Concentrating on the early black-and-white paintings that made Ms. Riley famous, it presents stringently pure yet accessible works that have, at their best, extended the optical potential implicit in the work of Mondrian, Josef Albers and Ad Reinhardt. At their weakest, their meticulously calibrated patterns can be so aggressive that they virtually kidnap the eye, take it on a joy ride and leave it in a crumpled heap. Either way, the overall effect is of an artist of unusual dedication who has remained loyal to the original premises of her art and yet steadfastly refused to repeat herself. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and the elderly (Smith).</p>
        <p>''RUSKIN'S ITALY, RUSKIN'S ENGLAND,'' Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through Jan. 7). This show commemorates the 100th anniversary of the death of John Ruskin (1819-1900), artist, art and architectural critic, social reformer, educator and the first official professor of art in England. From its own collections, the Morgan has mined a biographical medley of letters, manuscripts, photographs, drawings, paintings and artifacts relating to the life of this Victorian giant, whose published writings run to 39 volumes. Although not really an art show, it includes paintings and drawings by Ruskin and artists he admired, among them J. M. W. Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. It touches on his widely influential books of criticism, his beautifully finished sketches of architectural structures, his teaching and his monographs on proposed social reforms. Not omitted are his 1877 attack on James McNeill Whistler, his failed marriage and attraction to young girls and his sad end after a long siege of mental illness. But there is much to celebrate in his life, and this show doesn't stint. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6 for students and the elderly; free for children under 13 with an adult (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* SCYTHIAN GOLD. ''The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures From the Russian Steppes,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 4.). ''Gold of the Nomads: Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 21.). Certain kinds of art are box-office gold. Art made of gold is one of them, and there's a Fort Knox-size supply of the precious stuff in these two opulent exhibitions. The Brooklyn show is a survey-style glimpse at some exquisitely wrought 14-carat objects drawn from museums in Ukraine, where the Scythians put down roots in the first millennium B.C. The Met has drop-dead museological rarities from the State Hermitage Museum, but the focus here, which gives the proceedings a kind treasure-hunt thrill, is on a cache of objects excavated fairly recently from tombs belonging to non-Scythian people whose identity is something of a mystery. Ideally, the two shows should be seen together: they offer a really substantial archaeological update on the last big Scythian showcase in these parts, the Met's smash-hot ''In the Land of the Scythians'' of 25 years ago. Hours and admission: See above( Cotter).</p>
        <p>* EDWARD STEICHEN, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Feb. 4). A big, thorough exhibition, maybe a little too big and glossy, of one of the great photographers in American history, a restless, benign, flawed genius. Steichen also painted, made films, designed textiles, organized aerial reconnaissance photography in two world wars and put together the most popular photography exhibition ever, ''The Family of Man.'' We'll see how people respond to someone whose eclectic work can look, if anything, almost too elegant and self-regarding. Steichen ultimately seemed to reduce everything and everyone to props to demonstrate his own refined and stage-savvy sensibility. But what refinement. His best work has a finesse that borders on the erotic. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>DAN FLAVIN, Zwirner &amp; Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677 (through Nov. 4). Flavin's simple, fluorescent-light works from the 60's illuminate this posh new gallery to simultaneously matter-of-fact and mystically radiant effect. The white ones have classic Minimalist rigor; examples consisting of just two or three colors are almost hedonistically sumptuous (Johnson).</p>
        <p>JOHN GOSSAGE AND HERMANN VOGEL, ''Empire,'' Roth Horowitz, 160a East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067 (through Oct. 28). A veteran Conceptualist photographer, Mr. Gossage has orchestrated a dry but sly installation that intersperses his own oblique, fragmentary photographs of famous American memorials (shot on surveillance film using a hand-made telephoto lens) with beautiful, mid-19th-century photographs of Egyptian archaeological sites by the German photographer Vogel. This produces a suggestive layering of histories and politics (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''REMBRANDT AND THE VENETIAN INFLUENCE,'' Salander-O'Reilly Galleries, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606 (through Nov. 18). The Venetian influence in Rembrandt's later paintings has long been noted; this show is an attempt to demonstrate by specific examples. But the topic is more suited to a museum presentation; this one mounts only a dozen paintings, three by Rembrandt and one labeled ''Studio of Rembrandt,'' along with oils by Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese. It is too small and catch-as-catch can to make the case. The most salient example here of Venice in Rembrandt is his great painting ''Flora'' (circa 1654). Next to it, the other works in this show pale (Glueck).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>MAGDALENA ABAKANOWICZ, Marlborough, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900 (through Oct. 28). This pre-eminent Polish sculptor's regiment of 95 life-size, headless shells of human figures in rough bronze confronts the visitor here, creating a theater of tragic existentialism. On the terrace, giant, simplified dinosaur heads suggest a deep background of primordial terror (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* RINEKE DIJKSTRA, Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160 (through Oct. 28). This Dutch artist's solo debut in the United States includes a video (much seen elsewhere) of dancing teenagers in European clubs and a series of photographs she has been taking since 1997 of children in parks. In the video the youngsters preen touchingly. The photographs, color pictures along the lines of Thomas Struth's but more casual and less chilly, are heroic portraits, acutely sympathetic (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>LARRY CALKINS, American Primitive, 594 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 966-1530 (through Oct. 28). Mr. Calkins, who is based in Washington State, is self-taught but his work in various media has a professional-looking sophistication. Flat, child-size dresses on hangers -- one sprouting big nails, another festooned with little discs bearing the image of a moth -- are materially rough but poetically graceful. The surfaces of small paintings made of soot swarm mysteriously with ghostly images of flying insects (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MONIKA KULICKA, John Gibson, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-1192 (through Oct. 30). As a protest against modern civilization's mechanization of the world, this young Polish artist who now lives in New York has slathered real, mossy green chlorophyll over five pieces of old wood furniture in a quixotic attempt to restore the dead wood to life. The absurdity of the gesture is amusing and yet somehow a little sad (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''LIFE, AFTER THE SQUIRREL,'' Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347 (through Oct. 28). This nutty fun house of a show begins with Filipe Miguel's rustic shed, supposedly inhabited by post-apocalyptic squirrels. The main exhibition space has a squishy plastic floor and a ceiling of inflated pine trees. Works include Tony Tasset's stuffed ''Dead Bluejay''; Aernout Mik's video of old men horsing around; a hypnotic video by Pipilotti Rist; John Neff's deadpan video recital of Hal the computer's last speech; and Vincent Pruden's provocative makeup table for applying blackface (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ALICE MAHER, Nolan/Eckman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-6190 (through Oct. 28). An Irish sculptor who creates evocative metaphors in a variety of media, Ms. Maher is having her first New York exhibition. ''Gorget'' consists of two sets of nine potato-size, smoothed-over female heads that look like archaeological treasures; one set is of solid crystal, the other, of chrome-plated bronze, looks as though it were made of mercury. On paper, the artist draws fields of interwoven loopy lines that look like undulating expanses of netting (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''PARADISE NOW: PICTURING THE GENETIC REVOLUTION,'' Exit Art, 548 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-7748 (through Oct. 28). ''We are at a threshold,'' declares the text panel at the start of this show. And we are, you know. Never mind that most of the art isn't great, because with more and more artists tapping into science, something big is bound to happen soon. Think of this as a preliminary report. The works span a decade and run the gamut from paintings and sculptures to the collecting of sperm and the breeding of very tiny exotic frogs. The artists fret predictably about tampering with Mother Nature and stress identity politics, also predictably, but the spirit of the show, an intangible, tips the scales in a positive direction (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>DAVID RABINOWITCH, Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through Nov. 18). Restricting his vocabulary to circles, ovals and straight lines, and his means to pencil, ink or colored pencil, this Constructivist-Minimalist sculptor produced this series of extremely spare drawings during the early 1970's. Called ''Construction of Vision,'' they are resolutely abstract and quasi-scientific. But the ellipses and angled lines, cleanly drawn with mechanical drafting tools, have a subtly playful animation (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CHRIS VERENE, American Fine Arts, 22 Wooster Street, (212) 941-0401 (through Nov. 11) and Paul Morris, 465 West 23rd Street, (212) 727-2752 (through Oct. 28) With often piercing intimacy, this 31-year-old photographer chronicles the lives of friends and relatives in his hometown of Galesburg, Ill. Each of 60 richly colored, squarish images in this two-gallery show has a brief handwritten text added by the artist. Under the picture of a cousin, Steve, and his young daughter at a McDonalds, the text says, ''His wife had just left them to go to a battered woman's shelter.'' A dozen prints, at Paul Morris, tenderly document the daily existence of Mr. Verene's grandfather (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* NEIL WINOKUR, Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 431-0166 (through Oct. 28). For this delightful portrait of his hometown, Mr. Winokur has produced a series of 32 still-life photographs, each a crystal-clear, deadpan picture of an ordinary but richly iconic object against a bright colored backdrop. A Greek-style paper coffee cup, a Chinese food container, a Giants pennant, an old Broadway playbill, a Con Edison orange cone, a hot dog, a rat, a toy-size Empire State Building: these images produce a resonantly evocative cross section of New York experience (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>DAMIEN HIRST, Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111 (through Dec. 16). Welcome to the Damien Hirst Universe. It's a big shiny place with mathematical grid paper printed on the walls, pale pristine dot paintings and many large vitrine sculptures, including two outfitted as gynecological examining rooms and filled with water and fish. It shows the artist moving beyond the dead animals and putrefying flesh that catapulted him to fame while clarifying and enriching the grandiose themes of his art: life and death and their complex, sometimes oppressive relationship to science and commerce. It contains some undeniable duds, but if it doesn't win over those who have resisted the work of this notorious young British artist, it won't be for lack of trying (Smith).</p>
        <p>* PETER HUJAR, ''Photographs, 1980 to 1987,'' Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200 (through Oct. 28). A show of 98 photographs from Hujar's estate, some never shown before. The prints, on a particularly warm paper that is no longer made, are quite beautiful. One would not use that adjective for the images, which are powerful and quietly, deeply disturbing, full of pain but resolutely refusing to dramatize it, now and again touching, now and again amusing in an elegiac sort of way. They are portraits of friends, some nude, some in costume, some engaged in odd enterprises like biting into a strawberry. They are portraits -- they cannot be called anything else -- of animals. They are images of destruction: collapsed houses, the flayed carcasses of slain cows, a dead dog on a heap of trash. They are intense and reticent at the same time. They are memorable (Vicki Goldberg).</p>
        <p>ALBERT RENGER-PATZSCH, Tatintsian, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 633-0110 (through Oct. 28). If the German photographer Renger-Patzsch (1897-1966) were working today, he would probably make his formally perfect, subtly poetic pictures of industrialized landscapes, medieval church interiors and close-up plant studies into glossy, sofa-size Cibachromes. These small black-and-white vintage prints from the 1920's and 30's offer a welcome, intimately evocative respite from today's overly showy photo-aesthetics (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>''RE-DRAWING THE LINE,'' Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-0473 (through Oct. 28). This unfocused show of works in which line figures, literally or conceptually, includes an invigorating giant doodle by Diana Cooper; whited out ledger pages by Peter Wegner; the image of a scribble cut from brown felt by Arturo Herrera; a dripped line from a performance by Francis Alys; a string sculpture by Pae White; and tangled plastic zip ties by Mungo Thomson. The importance of line in obliquely conceptual works by Alessandro Balteo and Sophie Tottie is harder to see (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>SUZANNE ANKER, Universal Concepts Unlimited, 507 West 24th Street, (212) 727-7575 (through tomorrow). One of those Leonardo types who like to combine art and science, Ms. Anker presents silk-screened paintings and sculptures addressing the representation of genetics. Silk-screen panels display silvery, gridded fields of chromosome symbols with little human images mixed in. The 500 silver-painted, three-dimensional letters A, C, T and G piled on a glass panel refer to DNA. (Johnson).</p>
        <p>LOUISE FISHMAN, Cheim &amp; Read, 521 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727 (through tomorrow). Ms. Fishman's Abstract Expressionist painting is still tough and gritty in its bluntly gestural, grid-based physicality, but now it has a lusciousness of color that verges on the hedonistic. ''A Stranger,'' with its web of impulsively made, wide slate-gray lines over a salmon pink field, is a voluptuous yet still excitingly raw picture (Johnson).</p>
        <p>PETER GOULD, Kagan Martos, 515 Broadway, near Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 343-4293 (through tomorrow). This young Pop-Conceptualist presents two neat, small parklike installations based on fast-food restaurant landscaping. Grass is represented by green Formica and bushes by silhouettes cut from thin flat panels; stacked red bricks provide architectural framing. These cartoonlike abstractions of the modern, corporate oasis are quietly funny and oddly touching (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER,'' Kaikodo, 164 East 64th Street, (212) 223-0121 (through tomorrow). Kaikodo's sales exhibitions are always a treat, and the sheer number of Chinese and Japanese paintings in this one is a major lure. These days New Yorkers rarely get to see material in this quantity and variety outside museums. Highlights include an album painting of a flower attributed to the 13th-century artist Qian Xuan (it's very fragile, so you have to ask to see it); a 17th-century calligraphic scroll by the fractious Fu Shan; and a witty four-panel portrait of a family of gibbons, gold-medal acrobats all. Devotees of ceramics and textiles will also find much to admire (Cotter).</p>
        <p>BARBARA KRUGER, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Sunday). A lot has changed about the art world in the 20 years or so since Barbara Kruger came on the scene with her snappy photomontages, but a lot has not changed about her work. Her trademark red, white and black text-and-photograph montage is a brand product of the immediate past. Dense and noisy, this retrospective, including audio embellishments, has an intended carnival atmosphere without frivolity. Your reaction will necessarily depend on a blend of generational sympathy, political concord, aesthetic expectation and tolerance for sarcasm. Ms. Kruger in a sense helped pave the way for her own diminished currency, which for a political artist like her may be viewed as a kind of success. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>GERHARD RICHTER, Barbara Mathes, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-5135 (through tomorrow). This exhibition of small works by the enigmatic and hugely influential German painter features a group of canvases from the 80's and 90's bearing his familiar brand of beautifully scraped, dragged and squeegeed Abstract Expressionism and an intriguing six-part photographic self-portrait in which blurry shirtless men -- the artist himself multiply exposed -- do mysterious things in dim, empty rooms (Johnson).</p>
        <p>BRIDGET RILEY, ''Paintings 1982-2000 and Early Works on Paper,'' PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292 (through tomorrow). This show picks up where the small survey of Bridget Riley's paintings at the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea leaves off, following her continued involvement with color through nine recent canvases, while a group of gouache studies from the 1960's documents the transition from black-and-white to color, through subtly vivid tones of gray (Smith).</p>
        <p>DAVID SMITH, ''The Last Nudes,'' Gagosian, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through tomorrow). Made in 1964 and not seen during the great modernist sculptor's lifetime, ''The Last Nudes'' is a series of paintings of naked women, each rendered in a loose, drippy black line on white easel-scale canvas. Smith used an enamel-loaded ear syringe to make them. The Freudian implications may be amusing -- the emission of vital fluids triggered by female flesh -- but the pictures, though not without a certain graphic vitality, are barely worth a glance (Johnson).</p>
