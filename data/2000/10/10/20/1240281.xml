        <p>Backers of a proposed sports arena here for the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils gathered today to prod Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to quickly commit state aid to the project, arguing that it had economic and social benefits for both the state and the city.</p>
        <p>Many in the group, which was dominated by Democratic officials, criticized the Republican governor, whose administration announced in August that all public aid to the arena would be limited to $75 million in infrastructure improvements. The group pressed her to be more generous in supporting the effort, an 18,000-seat arena that is estimated to cost $325 million.</p>
        <p>The session, convened by the likely Democratic candidate for governor in 2001, Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge, was attended by top officials of YankeeNets, which owns the teams and would be the arena's likely developer, Mayor Sharpe James of Newark and other political and corporate leaders.</p>
        <p>They concluded that Newark would be a better location for a new arena than the Meadowlands, where a money-losing operation currently exists, and that if such a complex were to be built here, it would accelerate the city's revitalization. Harvey Schiller, the president of YankeeNets, said the proposal reflected a nationwide trend of moving sports teams to urban centers from suburban locations.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey said in an interview that he could see the state contributing as much as one- to two-thirds of the cost of the arena. The aid would include improvements in roads and other infrastructure as well as public funds to supplement private investment and to attract funds at low interest.</p>
        <p>Citing recently confirmed reports that the Meadowlands complex, where the Nets and Devils now play, was losing money and costing taxpayers about $50 million a year in operating subsidies, Mr. McGreevey said that building a Newark arena made good fiscal sense.</p>
        <p>The Whitman administration has been negotiating for the last two months with YankeeNets on state assistance for the arena. Pete McDonough, a spokesman for the governor, said the gathering today was unnecessary because the administration had been making great progress in those talks.</p>
        <p>''This is purely political for McGreevey, an announced candidate for governor, to call a forum to ask for more money when we are making progress,'' Mr. McDonough said.</p>
        <p>Rae Hutton, a spokesman for the Senate president Donald T. DiFrancesco, a likely Republican candidate for governor, said that it was not surprising that Mr. McGreevey -- who raised Woodbridge taxes to build a new municipal building -- would call for more public financing for the arena.</p>
        <p>More than two years ago Governor Whitman contended that the Nets and the Devils should remain at the Continental Arena at the Meadowlands, which is state owned. But the Nets seemed determined to move to a new arena in Newark. The governor then said that the state would not assist them unless the Nets could lure another sports team to make the proposed arena economically viable.</p>
        <p>At the time, Dr. John J. McMullen owned the Devils and was pressing for a plan to build an arena in Hoboken. But he sold the team to the YankeeNets last spring and removed any barrier to the two teams moving in unison. The governor's office then said that in its negotiations with YankeeNets it would insist that all city, county and state public aid be capped at $75 million. In addition, it would continue to try to press for a rebuilt arena at the Meadowlands.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. McDonough said that the state had dropped the idea of building an arena anywhere other than Newark and that it would be flexible on the $75 million limit.</p>
