        <p>Sotheby's has omitted a few details from its catalog for today's sale of the contents of Mercer House, the 19th-century Italianate mansion in the heart of Savannah, Ga., that is perhaps best known as the home of Jim Williams. He was the antiques dealer who was the protagonist in ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' the best-selling book, and in the movie based on it.</p>
        <p>Take Lot 399, an Oushak carpet from the first half of the 20th century, expected to sell for $10,000 to $15,000. The carpet is the one on which Danny Hansford, the 21-year-old lover of Williams, fell when he was shot to death in 1981. A bullet hole in the carpet was crucial evidence in the well-documented murder trials as prosecutors measured the angle of the bullet's path through the carpet and into the floor to prove that Williams fired the last shots, execution style, standing over Hansford as he lay dying on the carpet.</p>

        <p>Sotheby's has omitted a few details from its catalog for today's sale of the contents of Mercer House, the 19th-century Italianate mansion in the heart of Savannah, Ga., that is perhaps best known as the home of Jim Williams. He was the antiques dealer who was the protagonist in ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' the best-selling book, and in the movie based on it.</p>
        <p>Take Lot 399, an Oushak carpet from the first half of the 20th century, expected to sell for $10,000 to $15,000. The carpet is the one on which Danny Hansford, the 21-year-old lover of Williams, fell when he was shot to death in 1981. A bullet hole in the carpet was crucial evidence in the well-documented murder trials as prosecutors measured the angle of the bullet's path through the carpet and into the floor to prove that Williams fired the last shots, execution style, standing over Hansford as he lay dying on the carpet.</p>
        <p>All Sotheby's catalog says is that the carpet has an ''open mustard field with a bold serrated pale blue medallion and moss green spandrels within a lavender angular vine and rosette border, open mustard outer surround, minor losses and slits to ends.'' Nowhere is the shooting or the bullet hole mentioned.</p>
        <p>''It's rather ghoulish to put up for sale a rug that has been drenched in a dying boy's blood without informing unsuspecting bidders,'' said John Berendt, author of ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.''</p>
        <p>Williams, 59, died in 1990, six months after being acquitted at his fourth trial.</p>
        <p>Asked why Sotheby's did not reveal the history of the carpet, Matthew Weigman, an auction house spokesman, said the company had no comment.</p>
        <p>Water Tower as Art</p>
        <p>There will be a new silhouette on the West 53rd Street skyline: a water tower that at first glance looks like other New York City water towers. But this one is made of translucent resin and changes between green and white, depending on the light.</p>
        <p>The tower is the creation of Rachel Whiteread, the English artist who over the last decade has made a considerable name for herself casting the interior volumes of familiar objects and structures in materials like plaster, resin, concrete, wax or rubber. Ms. Whiteread, who won the coveted $32,000 Turner Prize in 1995, has cast works in this manner before, everything from water bottles and bathtubs to an entire house.</p>
        <p>Her water tower was commissioned by the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit organization that presents art around the city. For the last two years it has been atop 60 Grand Street, at West Broadway in SoHo. But next weekend the 9,500-pound water tower will be moved to the northwest corner of the Museum of Modern Art's roof.</p>
        <p>The work has been given to the Modern by Susan, Karen and Nina Freedman in honor of their parents, Doris and Alan Freedman. Susan Freedman is the president of the Public Art Fund, which her mother founded in 1977.</p>
        <p>''The water tower seemed to stand for the city in so many wonderful ways,'' she said. ''It represents what my parents loved about New York.''</p>
        <p>Kirk Varnedoe, chief curator of paintings and sculpture at the Modern, said the museum had selected the roof location where the tower would be most visible from the street. How long it will stay on the roof hasn't been determined. The museum will close in spring 2002 for its major renovation and expansion.</p>
        <p>Auctioneer Is Back</p>
        <p>Simon de Pury, the former chairman of Sotheby's in Europe, who was one of the company's most visible auctioneers before his resignation three years ago, is returning to the rostrum -- for Phillips.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Pury said this week that he had agreed to take two Phillips sales: its auction of Impressionist and modern art on Nov. 6 and its auction of contemporary art on Nov. 13, both at the American Craft Museum on West 53rd Street. But that's as far as his affiliation with the auction house goes. ''When I left Sotheby's, I thought I would no longer conduct auctions,'' he said. ''But I've actually been doing a lot of charity sales.''</p>
        <p>Ever since LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton bought Phillips a year ago, it has been trying to hire top-flight talent from Sotheby's and Christie's. It has also been looking for someone to run the rudderless auction house.</p>
        <p>Art world experts say Mr. de Pury was being wooed to run Phillips, but he said the current arrangement was not a sign of things to come, only ''a two-shot deal.'' Meanwhile, Mr. de Pury has resigned from the board of Gucci, one of LVMH's rivals, where he had served for several years.</p>
        <p>Finding a Michelangelo</p>
        <p>Since 1991 Sotheby's has been selling the contents of Castle Howard, known to millions of television viewers as the stately home in Yorkshire where Evelyn Waugh's ''Brideshead Revisited'' was shot. Everything has been up for sale, from dusty bureaus, abandoned dinner services and rusty watering cans -- the contents of its attic -- right down to a multimillion-dollar painting by Guercino.</p>
        <p>Just when you thought there was nothing left, Sotheby's has announced it has discovered a Michelangelo drawing that it expects to bring $8.7 million to $11.6 million.</p>
        <p>The drawing, ''Mourning Woman,'' was discovered in an album of otherwise undistinguished old master drawings that had been in the library. It is thought to have been made early in the artist's career, from 1495 to 1505.</p>
        <p>Only after months of tests did Sotheby's confirm the attribution. Simon Howard, who lives at Castle Howard, said he had decided to sell the drawing in part because the cost of insuring it would be prohibitive and also because he felt it should be in a public collection, officials at Sotheby's said.</p>
        <p>James Miller, deputy chairman of Sotheby's in Europe, said the drawing would first be offered to the national museums in Britain. If they cannot raise the money, it will be sold in London next year. ''We're incredibly lucky to have over 100 Michelangelo drawings in London,'' he said. ''But Edinburgh has none.''</p>
