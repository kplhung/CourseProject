        <p>HOPE springs eternal at the CMJ Music Marathon, the annual rock convention and showcase that opened last night in dozens of clubs around New York City.</p>
        <p>New bands, hundreds of them, hope for recording contracts, good reviews or at least some names to add to their e-mail lists. Established performers hope to rekindle old loyalties and to prove they're still worth hearing. College radio programmers hope to make contacts that will lead to jobs after graduation, independent label moguls hope to reach tastemakers, and Web site operators hope to generate more clicks.</p>
        <p>What they're not hoping for -- most of them, anyway -- is the kind of stardom and windfalls that seemed within reach a decade ago. ''The goal right now,'' said Bobby Haber, the founder of CMJ, ''is to figure out a way to make sustainable careers for the artists who don't choose to go down a traditional path.''</p>
        <p>This year's event is the 20th annual music marathon presented by CMJ, which used to stand for College Media Journal and now encompasses trade and consumer magazines, music conventions and an extensive Web site (www.cmj.com), including a new ''artist services'' zone where up-and-coming musicians can submit songs for evaluation. As it moves into its third decade, the marathon has had a longer career than most of the musicians it has presented.</p>
        <p>Still, this year's marathon includes some songwriters who have been on the college circuit since the 1980's or before, among them David Lowery of the groups Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven (tonight at Acme Underground), Grant Hart of Husker Du (tonight at the Cooler), Damon and Naomi, formerly of Galaxie 500 (tonight at the Knitting Factory), Ari Up of the Slits (tomorrow at Wetlands), and the Waco Brothers, a band featuring Jon Langdon of the Mekons (tomorrow at Brownies and later at Maxwell's). Chuck D of Public Enemy is the convention's keynote speaker and he introduces his new group, Confrontation Camp, tomorrow night at CBGB. At the other extreme, the marathon includes bands whose members may have more relatives than fans.</p>
        <p>Over the years the CMJ marathon has reflected how collegiate rock infiltrated the mainstream, briefly ruled the charts and has since been devoted to making a decent living at the margins. Because the mainstream music business puts its faith in charts, CMJ made national charts of what was being played on college radio stations, which have historically taken pride in ignoring commercial considerations and championing the new and the obscure. A barely known band on an independent label, selling a few thousand copies of an album, could have a No. 1 record on a CMJ chart, which is one way of impressing a recording company.</p>
        <p>The Gold Standard</p>
        <p>The commercial peak arrived in the mid-1980's and early 90's, when collegiate favorites like R.E.M. (which started in the college town of Athens, Ga.), New Order and of course Nirvana made their way to broad mainstream popularity. Collegiate rock, perpetually seeking brains as well as heart, was in sync with a public that was finally catching up to punk-rock. In the early 90's grunge convinced major labels as well as college radio programmers that today's club act could be tomorrow's Soundgarden.</p>
        <p>But grunge turned out to be a watershed. ''It was the greatest blessing and the greatest curse,'' Mr. Haber said. ''The minute alternative rock became commoditized; all of a sudden it was no longer about very passionate kids making exciting music. And suddenly, if it didn't sell gold, it was worthless.''</p>
        <p>Recording companies signed college-circuit acts and eventually dropped them when they didn't conquer the Top 40; selling tens of thousands of albums to dedicated fans didn't cover the overhead at a giant conglomerated recording company. The marathon includes bands like Ida (tomorrow at the Bowery Ballroom) and the Ass Ponys (tonight at CB's Lounge) that have returned to independent labels after going through the crucible of major-label deals.</p>
        <p>An era of lowered expectations has forced musicians to be resourceful. Along with the ever-unpopular option of a day job, some have chosen to multitask their music. BT (Brian Transeau), the electronica composer who is at the Roxy tonight, has scored films and created video-game sounds. Momus (tomorrow at the Fez), who writes drolly misanthropic songs set to giddy synthesizer tracks, chose an older strategy to finance an album: he had patrons commission him to write songs about them.</p>
        <p>In the last few years pop has swung toward the unserious and anti-intellectual, and at the moment its guiding commercial mind-set comes not from collegiate tastes but from high school boys craving trash-mouth rebellion and from junior high school girls looking for dreamboats. Meanwhile college radio stations are back to playing the music that sounds best in dorm rooms. Most of it has cult-size followings, not megahit potential, but its fans treat the music as more than a passing thrill. They delve into obscure lyrics and exult in finding rare releases; they follow careers while the mainstream music business is busily selling one-hit wonders.</p>
        <p>College radio stations are playing the post-post-punk rock called emo, with its knotty guitar riffs and determinedly sincere vocals, from bands like At the Drive-In (tonight at Irving Plaza), Jets to Brazil and Pedro the Lion (both tonight at Bowery Ballroom) and Burning Airlines (tonight at the Thompson Center at New York University). They're playing alternative country and Americana, the roots-rock hybrids sung by people like Neko Case and Her Boyfriends (Sunday at the Mercury Lounge), Laura Cantrell (tonight at the Rodeo Bar) and the early-Springsteen-style Marah (tonight at the Mercury Lounge). They're playing introspective bands like Grandaddy (tonight at Irving Plaza), Clem Snide (tonight at Tonic), Death Cab for Cutie (tonight at Brownies) and the Mendoza Line (tonight at the Knitting Factory).</p>
        <p>They're playing elaborate neo-psychedelic pop from bands like Oranger (Sunday at Great Lakes) and Of Montreal (tonight at the Knitting Factory), and fractured, noise-edged pop from bands like Starlight Mints (tomorrow at the Cooler). They're playing ''stoner rock'' that looks back, with mixed affection and irony, at the big guitar riffs and arena ambitions of the 70's, with bands like High on Fire (tonight at the Continental). They're playing thoughtful, guitar-picking songwriters like Amy Correia (tonight at the Cutting Room) and Teddy Thompson (Sunday at the Westbeth Theater Center).</p>
        <p>They're playing electronic dance and ambient music from disc-jockey-producer-programmers like David Holmes (tomorrow night at Centro-Fly), Spring Heel Jack (tomorrow at the Bowery Ballroom) and Armand Van Helden (Sunday at Centro-Fly). They're playing quirky homemade music like the faux-naive Christian songs of Danielson Famile (tonight at the Cooler). And they're playing alternative hip-hop, from the nerdy, hilariously sophomoric MC Paul Barman to the politically charged Mr. Len (both at Westbeth tonight).</p>
        <p>College radio stations, along with public radio stations, are also the last bastion of more venerable styles, like blues and jazz, and an outlet for world music, although those are barely represented at the marathon.</p>
        <p>Musically all those styles have little to share. They're part of the proliferation of genres and subgenres that now defines popular music. But with all their differences they manage to survive without mass promotion, reaching their fans in unpredictable ways: not just through occasional play on a college radio station but through what Internet types are starting to call ''trust networks.'' It's the extension of old-fashioned word of mouth and its amplification into what the entertainment business calls buzz, which now encompasses chat rooms, news groups, ''hot lists'' on file-sharing sites like Napster and Scour, and the automated taste-monitoring and marketing suggestions of Internet radio stations and retail sites. Hip-hop (both mainstream and alternative) and electronica have already mastered buzz building; other collegiate styles can take notes.</p>
        <p>Jammed Underground</p>
        <p>The function of the CMJ marathon, as it was in 1981, is less to help unknown bands crash into the big time -- as much as they think they'd like to -- than to reinforce and spread those word-of-mouth networks. That's why many of the musicians, and CMJ itself, are counting on the Internet. It offers the chance to reach widely scattered listeners, who in turn can tell other potential fans. Web sites have taken over the CMJ convention floor, where do-it-yourself CD makers used to be.</p>
        <p>But the Internet has opened the floodgates for music that should have stayed in its makers' basements and bedrooms; strategies are still being invented to sift through the morass. And even when the word does get out about a great unknown band, it's an open question whether that band can make money selling its music if songs have been bouncing around the Internet at no cost. The independent-music underground is bigger now, and better wired, than it was in 1981, as well as more fragmented. The question, then and now, is how promising musicians can break even.</p>
        <p>''We're not promising to make you stars,'' Mr. Haber said. ''But if you believe that this is your calling, we hope to offer something that helps you stay alive.''</p>
        <p>A Herd of Dreamers</p>
        <p>The CMJ Music Marathon continues through Sunday. There are panel discussions at the New York Hilton Towers, Avenue of the Americas at 53rd Street. A $495 festival pass ($250 for students) covers admission to all concerts and panel discussions; single tickets vary in price and can be bought at the performance sites. Marathon information: (877) 633-7848 or www.cmj.com. Highlights and the sites for events this weekend follow. The individual clubs can be called for information on performers, times of the shows, admission prices and other details. Shows are subject to change.</p>
