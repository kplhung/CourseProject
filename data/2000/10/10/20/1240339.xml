        <p>Unemployment in New York City continued to drop last month, and has declined sharply over the last year, according to figures released yesterday by the New York State Department of Labor. After adjustment for seasonal factors, the jobless rate in the city fell to 5.6 percent, from 5.8 percent in August and 6.7 percent a year ago. The rest of the state did not fare as well in September; the unemployment rate rose slightly, to 3.9 percent, which was also the national rate. A year ago, both upstate New York and the nation had jobless rates of 4.2 percent. The end of the communication workers' strike against Verizon caused an unusually big increase in the number of people working in September. But job growth has been strong over the last year, rising by 2.1 percent in the state and 2.5 percent in New York City. Rockland County experienced the fastest pace of job growth in the state, at 2.9 percent; in Buffalo and Niagara Falls, the number of jobs edged up only 0.3 percent.</p>
