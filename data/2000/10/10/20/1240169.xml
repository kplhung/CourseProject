        <p>The Patriot</p>
        <p>A gentle farmer with a gang of children to provide for, Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson, left) is determined to keep himself and his eldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger), out of the Revolutionary War. A man with a violent past, Benjamin rejects fighting because he's so good at it. Eventually, though, he can't avoid the call to battle, which is bad news for the British, of whom he makes fast and ruthless work. The same might be said for Roland Emmerich's film, which becomes, Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times, ''a gruesome hybrid, a mix of sentimentality and brutality that suggests a 'Lethal Weapon' movie directed by Norman Rockwell.''</p>
        <p>2000. Columbia Tristar. $112.18; DVD, $27.95. 158 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Oct. 24.</p>

        <p>Up at the Villa</p>
        <p>An experienced hand at adapting unlikely literary properties, Philip Haas (''Angels and Insects'') doesn't have very good luck with a lesser novella by W. Somerset Maugham. A page from the Merchant-Ivory cookbook calls for a gorgeous setting (Florence), international stars and a dash of historical trouble. Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is an English widow adrift in Tuscany and ripe for entanglements with an imperial muckety-muck with the stiffest of upper lips (James Fox) and an American adventurer (Sean Penn). Though it's interesting enough, the story ''would benefit from a crisp, straightforward presentation instead of the slow, talky, sodden treatment it receives here'' (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>2000. USA . $56.49; DVD, $24.95. 115 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Oct. 24.</p>
        <p>Keeping the Faith</p>
        <p>A priest named Brian (Edward Norton) and the rabbi who is his best friend, Jake (Ben Stiller), are in love with the same woman (Jenna Elfman). ''I think I've heard this one,'' says a bartender in the film, Mr. Norton's directorial debut. Before they became a freaky triangle, the three were childhood friends. Here they roam through a comedy that gently skewers religious rituals, but ''the lightweight charm of the leads curdles when the film tries to home in on their dilemma'' (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2000. Touchstone. $107.37; DVD, $29.99. 129 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.</p>
        <p>Center Stage</p>
        <p>Culled from stiff auditions around the country, teenage dancers come to New York to train at the fictitious American Ballet Academy (somewhere near Lincon Center) and, if they are more than a little fortunate, be chosen for the American Ballet Company. A harlequin print of romantic triangles involving dancers, choreographers and the academy's fearsome artistic director (Peter Gallagher), Nicholas Hytner's film is best in dance scenes when it ''follows the performers without stepping on their toes, to marvelous effect'' (Scott).</p>
        <p>2000. Columbia Tristar. $107.37; DVD, $24.95. 113 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Oct. 24.</p>
        <p>Straight to Video</p>
        <p>Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.</p>
        <p>TREASURES FROM AMERICAN FILM ARCHIVES: 50 PRESERVED FILMS, 1893-1985. A  varied collection of independently made films, gathered from 18 archives around the country and put together into a set of four DVD's by the National Film Preservation Foundation. 11 hours. $99.99, with a 150-page book of credits and commentary. Distributed in retail outlets by Image Entertainment. Information: www.filmpreservation.org.</p>
        <p>THE BRITTAS EMPIRE and OPEN ALL HOURS. In the first of two British sitcoms, Gordon Brittas (Chris Barrie) outdoes Basil Fawlty as he arrogantly mismanages the Whitbury New Town Leisure Center, the English equivalent of a health club, making matters intolerable for all those around him. In ''Open All Hours,'' Ronnie Marker is maybe England's stingiest shopkeeper, something that cramps his pursuit of the voluptuous nurse Gladys. 2000. BFS, of Richmond Hill, Ontario. ''Brittas Empire,'' $49.98, three cassettes, 150 minutes; ''Hours,'' $49.98, three cassettes, 150 minutes. Information: (800) 268-3891.</p>
