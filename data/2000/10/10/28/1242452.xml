        <p>Aaron Glenn was nearly begging, trying to prevail upon a few people to plead his case to Coach Al Groh.</p>

        <p>Aaron Glenn was nearly begging, trying to prevail upon a few people to plead his case to Coach Al Groh.</p>
        <p>''Let me do a reverse,'' the cornerback said. ''I don't care if I'm a decoy. I just want to play offense a couple of times. I could line up and block. I'm not even asking for the ball. Just let me run an out route. You don't even have to look at me.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps Glenn is somewhere down on Groh's trick-play list, the one that has already had running back Curtis Martin throw a touchdown pass, cornerback Marcus Coleman line up as a receiver and catch a desperation pass, linebacker Mo Lewis run on a fake field goal and, perhaps most astonishing of all, the 6-foot-7-inch, 305-pound offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott making a bumbling, rumbling touchdown catch to send the Jets' Monday night game against the Miami Dolphins into overtime.</p>
        <p>Could anyone have imagined that behind Groh's stern facade, which would fit an Internal Revenue Service investigator, lies the heart of a guy dying to spin the roulette wheel?</p>
        <p>''Honestly, no,'' said Coleman, who became a receiver when quarterback Vinny Testaverde asked the coaches if he could have Coleman on offense. ''The call he made in New England, Mo's run, I was standing right next to him. He called it, it worked. I patted him on the butt. That's a gutsy call. From a team standpoint, when you see your coach doing that, taking chances like that, he's trusting the players that they'll make the plays. All that does is give you more confidence in him.''</p>
        <p>Groh is reluctant to take on the role of gambler, despite a playbook that has yielded almost one surprise a game. His predecessor, Bill Parcells, liked to pull the occasional surprise, too, but nothing like this.</p>
        <p>During training camp, Groh had linebackers line up in the backfield on goal-line situations. That may be the only trick that failed: the Jets tried to complete a short touchdown pass to linebacker Bryan Cox during preseason, but he dropped the ball. Since then, though, it is as if Groh had sprinkled pixie dust onto the playing field.</p>
        <p>''They're not in there for any purpose other than they are plays in the system,'' Groh said. ''You lose a lot of money in the market and in casinos gambling. You do well trying to play odds in your favor. Maybe it's my own validation of it, but I prefer to think of it in those terms.''</p>
        <p>None of the plays are an accident. They are practiced repeatedly. Players teased Martin during practice that he would tip off the opponent when he shucked the gloves he normally wears in preparation for throwing the ball. Martin's pass was wobbly and a photo showed that his hand was nowhere near the laces, but Wayne Chrebet was able to stretch to make the grab to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>
        <p>Lewis said he had been shocked when Groh called for his fourth-down run against the New England Patriots, figuring that the play they had practiced, in which punter Tom Tupa takes the snap and pitches to Lewis, would be kept in reserve for later weeks. And Elliott, the backup left tackle, may have caught the ball six out of seven times in practice, as Coleman estimated, but he bobbled it almost as many times before clutching it to his chest as he hit the ground for the touchdown, and the first reception of his career.</p>
        <p>''I had to make an adjustment on the ball,'' Elliott said, in jest. ''It was swanlike.''</p>
        <p>Martin said: ''More important that I'm stunned that we did it is I'm surprised so many have worked. Usually you might get one out of every five trick plays that may work. For us, they're all working.''</p>
        <p>Groh recalled that when he prepared to play Don Shula-coached Dolphins teams, there was always the suspicion that Miami would try an unusual play to get an edge. Trick plays not only terrify opposing teams, but they also demonstrate that a coach will try anything to win.</p>
        <p>''It seems like a special year,'' Coleman said of the remarkable success the trick plays have had. ''Sometimes you can go out and line everybody up and beat everyone straight up. But you don't want to keep it the same all the time.</p>
        <p>''If it works in practice, it will work in the game. We don't just let it work in practice. We definitely cover each other. Being open like that, you give yourself an edge. I'm sure he'll come up with something else.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>AL GROH continued to express disappointment with the play of the safeties, and a change could be coming. SCOTT FROST, who has spelled the starter, KEVIN WILLIAMS, at free safety the last two weeks, could replace Williams as the starter, although Groh would not reveal his plans. Both Williams and Frost were burned for big plays by the Dolphins, as was strong safety VICTOR GREEN. ''It's not just the free-safety situation,'' Groh said. ''The entire safety position has to play better.''</p>
