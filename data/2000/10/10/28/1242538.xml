        <p>As he accepted the World Series trophy yesterday morning, Yankees Manager Joe Torre paused to thank others.</p>
        <p>He first mentioned General Manager Brian Cashman, who was not at Shea Stadium because of the death of his wife's mother on Thursday. Cashman was the organization's point man on the many trades made during the season, including the deals for David Justice, Denny Neagle, Luis Sojo and Jose Vizcaino.</p>
        <p>Torre referred to Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, who is recovering from treatment for bone-marrow cancer and was not at Shea Stadium; and to the Yankees' scouting staff. Some in baseball believe the Yankees' scouts have benefited from the experience derived from their annual playoff preparation.</p>
        <p>Yankees scouts thought the Mets were vulnerable to high fastballs, from the leadoff batter Timo Perez to the slugger Mike Piazza to Jay Payton and Benny Agbayani. Yankee pitchers closely followed the reports and allowed 16 runs in five games, walking only 11 and striking out 48.</p>
