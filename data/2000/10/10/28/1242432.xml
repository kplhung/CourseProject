        <p>David J. O'Reilly, those who know him contend, is an exceedingly nice man. Considerate, they say, down to earth, a good listener. He is also chairman of Chevron, which last week agreed to take over Texaco to create the world's fifth-largest oil company. Is a nice guy up to the task?</p>
        <p>Shareholders and experts credit Mr. O'Reilly's charm and powers of persuasion for sealing the deal. But now, as Mr. O'Reilly, 53, takes the helm at the combined concern, to be called Chevron Texaco, some ask if an affable, relatively young executive who introduces himself as Dave can forge a corporation lean and mean enough to thrive.</p>
        <p>Much of the concern stems from Mr. O'Reilly's short track record, since he became Chevron's chairman only in January. Yet the merger has vaulted him into the ranks of oil chiefs like Sir John Browne of BP, Lee Raymond of Exxon Mobil and Thierry Desmarest of Totalfina Elf, men whose flair for taking risks harks back to the bold oil magnates of a century ago.</p>
        <p>Some experts question if Mr. O'Reilly fits the bill. Oil companies must become bigger and offer better earnings to attract investors enamored of the new economy.</p>
        <p>''He's a consensus builder,'' said the manager of a fund that owns shares of Chevron. ''When there's a consensus decision, it's usually low-risk. You can have a discussion about something, but there has to be one person outside the boardroom who takes the whole company upon himself.''</p>
        <p>The industry takeovers have created companies that are states unto themselves. While many in the industry began to recognize the need for mergers in early 1998, it took Sir John to begin the empire-building, as BP acquired Amoco and Arco in rapid succession.</p>
        <p>Sir John, 51, transformed British Petroleum into a powerhouse through internal change and acquisitions. And Mr. Desmarest, 54, led the French company Total in its acquisitions of Petrofina of Belgium and Elf Aquitaine within a year. The most successful merger may have been the marriage of Exxon and Mobil, led by Mr. Raymond of Exxon, who now runs the world's biggest oil company.</p>
        <p>Little unites their management styles, but each corporation seems an extension of the man at the top. A lover of opera and pre-Columbian art, Sir John is considered a pioneer -- for his takeover strategy, the independence of his business units and his attention to environmental and human rights issues. The reclusive Mr. Raymond may be his antithesis, blunt and unapologetic about doing things the traditional way. Mr. Desmarest, though soft-spoken, still used street-fighter instincts in his hostile takeover of Elf.</p>
        <p>Chevron arguably had its own philosopher-king in Kenneth Derr, Mr. O'Reilly's predecessor, who retired late last year. And skeptics and supporters of Mr. O'Reilly, who declined to be interviewed, agree that his ability to build on Mr. Derr's work will be crucial.</p>
        <p>After becoming chairman in 1989, Mr. Derr made a career of bucking the prevailing wisdom, industry experts said. He began restructuring in the early 1990's, but rather than cast a wide exploration net, he focused on a few potentially large fields, despite their location in hot spots like Kazakhstan and Angola.</p>
        <p>In spring 1999, Chevron tried to buy Texaco for $37.5 billion, which Texaco rejected as too low. But people close to the talks said much of the problem was the tension between Mr. Derr and Peter I. Bijur, Texaco's chairman. This time, Texaco was under shareholder pressure to find a partner. But it also helped that Mr. Bijur, to be vice chairman, now faced Mr. O'Reilly across the table.</p>
        <p>''Dave and Peter clicked,'' said one person involved in the talks.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Reilly has contributed to a culture that Mr. Derr helped nurture at Chevron, one where people have been on a ''first-name basis for the last generation,'' said one retired senior Chevron executive. The company is known for its lack of formality and decentralized structure.</p>
        <p>Being something of a self-made man may explain Mr. O'Reilly's unpretentiousness and his drive. The son a department store manager and a homemaker, Mr. O'Reilly grew up in Dublin in an era when Ireland's youth went abroad for their fortunes. A middle-distance runner, he was urged to train for the Olympics, but instead he studied engineering at University College of Dublin, where he was recruited by Chevron.</p>
        <p>''Our greatest export has been our people,'' said Professor John Kelly, a former instructor of Mr. O'Reilly. ''There's no chance now of getting Dave back. But he meets with his old friends here. He enjoys a pint of Guinness with the lads. He's a regular guy.''</p>
        <p>Among his achievements at Chevron, Mr. O'Reilly may be remembered best for the ''necktie rebellion'' in 1986 at the El Segundo, Calif., refinery outside Los Angeles. He told executives to shed their ties because ''he wanted to eliminate any solid line between the groups,'' the retired executive said.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Reilly's demeanor has helped him tackle a series of difficult jobs. In places like El Segundo, Mr. O'Reilly had to play diplomat as much as engineer, dealing not only with the workings of his plant but with California's stringent pollution laws and a community nervous about having a refinery close by. Under Mr. O'Reilly, Chevron's refining business reduced the frequency of breakdowns and accidents and increased earnings to $633 million in 1998 from $75 million in 1995.</p>
        <p>By 1998, Mr. O'Reilly was already on Chevron's board and became involved in its restructuring efforts, which stemmed in part from the acquisition of Gulf Oil in 1984, at $13.5 billion the industry's largest deal ever and ultimately a headache for Chevron.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Reilly ''saw a bad merger and what the company did to deal with it,'' said Frederick Leuffer, senior oil analyst with Bear, Stearns. ''You can bet that when all the approvals are in place, he and Bijur aren't going to waste any time cutting waste.''</p>
        <p>That Mr. Derr chose Mr. O'Reilly as his successor may attest to a toughness that his detractors may not see yet.</p>
        <p>''You need statesmanship when you go abroad and meet heads of state,'' said Etienne H. Deffrages, a global strategist at Andersen Consulting. ''You need a very steady hand in a dangerous business where you can get a phone call in the middle of the night that your workers have been kidnapped or a pipeline has exploded. The fact that Chevron picked someone so young who they think has those qualities means that he is probably exceptional. Don't assume that Dave O'Reilly isn't tough enough to do the job.''</p>
