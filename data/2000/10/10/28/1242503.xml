        <p>Detectives searching for a gunman who has sexually assaulted and robbed four women since September used a scrap of information from an apparently unrelated crime to trace a suspect to his home within a mile of where all the attacks occurred, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The detectives, from the Brooklyn Special Victims Squad, which investigates sex crimes, arrested Andy Joseph, 21, of 70 Linden Boulevard on Thursday night in the sex attacks and robberies, the police said. Most of the attacks began when the assailant confronted the women in elevators.</p>
        <p>Mr. Joseph, who lives with his sister, was charged with four counts of first-degree robbery, two counts of first-degree rape, one count of sodomy and one count each of attempted rape and attempted sodomy, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police were able to track down Mr. Joseph because a detective, Steven Litwin, had recalled that the brother of a man arrested for an unrelated killing in the area was a sex offender, said Lt. Derek Powers, who heads the Brooklyn Special Victims Squad.</p>
        <p>The detective, thinking it possible that the brother was the man he was seeking in the attacks, called the detective in the 70th Precinct who handled that murder investigation, Lieutenant Powers said. And while he found that there was no tie between the murder suspect's brother and his case, he learned that there had been an incident in the 70th Precinct in June that was similar to the pattern of sex attacks he was investigating.</p>
        <p>Although there was no sex attack in that case, the police had taken a report and learned that a security camera in the apartment building where it occurred had captured a man on videotape, Lieutenant Powers said. Detective Litwin showed a photograph made from the videotape to a woman who witnessed one of the four sex attacks and she identified the man in the photograph as the attacker.</p>
        <p>Armed with the photograph, Detective Litwin and another investigator, Detective Woody Simons, began canvassing the neighborhood around where the attacks occurred, focusing on Linden Boulevard.</p>
        <p>The superintendent of one of the buildings recognized the picture and told the detectives that he believed the man lived at 70 Linden Boulevard, Lieutenant Powers said. Using a police computer that lists people who have been arrested for crimes by their address, the detectives ran a check. Mr. Joseph, whose arrest photograph matched the picture from the videotape, was among those listed.</p>
        <p>Capt. Timothy Horner, of the Brooklyn Detective Bureau, credited the two investigators with solving the case and said the police were  reviewing other similar incidents in the area.</p>
