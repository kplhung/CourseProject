        <p>As close as the Mets came to the Yankees in each game of the World Series, the feeling remains that the teams were really not playing in the same ballpark (and that doesn't mean Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium). The scores indicated two almost evenly matched teams, but the real story was told by the outcomes of the games, not the scores.</p>
        <p>If the Mets had scored two runs, the Yankees would have scored three. If the Mets had scored six runs, the Yankees would have scored seven. The ratio of games won by each team seemed about right. If the Mets and the Yankees played a season's worth of postseason games, the Yankees might very well win 70 to 80 percent of them.</p>
        <p>The difference between the teams that might make a rivalry between pennant winners so one-sided is not necessarily in the personnel, but in approach and attitude and execution.</p>
        <p>''What I learned about that franchise this postseason is that winning becomes a habit,'' Andy MacPhail, the general manager of the Chicago Cubs, said yesterday. ''They can deliver the two-out, no-one-on rally that eludes the rest of us and get key hits from a variety of people. They don't rely on any one or two players or pitchers. That's a credit to their staff.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees staged their season's most significant two-out, no-one-on rally in the ninth inning of Game 5 Thursday night. After Al Leiter struck out Tino Martinez and Paul O'Neill, Jorge Posada walked. Then Scott Brosius and Luis Sojo singled him around the bases with the decisive run.</p>
        <p>Officials with many clubs were giving the Yankees credit yesterday for their achievement -- their third consecutive World Series championship and fourth in the last five years. But the line of credit was immediately followed by a ''but.'' Or the comments were reversed with the credit coming second.</p>
        <p>''If every club were allowed to spend $100 million in payroll, you would not have the same team winning every year,'' Jim Bowden, the Cincinnati Reds' general manager, said. ''But let's not take away from what the Yankees have accomplished. They deserve the credit where credit is due.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees continued their conquest of the rest of the major leagues, which only exacerbates the issue of payroll disparity. The Yankees had the highest payroll this year, no matter what method of computation is used, and it was reflected in their play.</p>
        <p>As if the payroll wasn't high enough when the season began, $92.5 million, the Yankees imported gobs of talent during the season, turning over 32 percent of their roster and raising the payroll to $112 million.</p>
        <p>''Brian did a tremendous job and deserves a lot of recognition for what the entire organization accomplished,'' MacPhail said, referring to General Manager Brian Cashman. ''The trades were a great boost to them.''</p>
        <p>Without at least some of the acquisitions, the Yankees would very likely have fallen short of their goal. ''Look at the moves they made,'' Dave Dombrowski, the Florida Marlins' general manager, said, then cited David Justice and Glenallen Hill as two players whose hitting fueled the Yankees. ''They have good baseball people making good decisions.''</p>
        <p>But while crediting the moves the Yankees made, the officials point out that few teams could have made them economically. The Oakland Athletics, for example, might have won that fifth game of their division series with the Yankees had they been able to acquire a front-line pitcher in July. But the Athletics have a $32 million payroll and were not substantially adding to it.</p>
        <p>MacPhail said baseball needs a system that would allow ''more teams to be more competitive on a more frequent basis.''</p>
        <p>Bowden cited poor television ratings and said people grow tired of seeing the same team win year after year. ''They'd like to see someone who has a chance,'' he said. ''But basically you know in spring training who's going to be there.''</p>
        <p>Asked what impact another Yankees World Series triumph makes on baseball, Bowden said: ''It continues to have an impact on the fact that higher payrolls have a much better chance of winning the World Series. But the Yankees know how to spend the money and put championship clubs on the field. A lot of teams, like the Dodgers, have money to spend, but the Yankees know how to spend the money, how to put good teams together, not just good players.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees' challenge, just as it has been the past two seasons, will be to sustain their level of play next season by continuing to spend wisely on good ingredients for the team. They know their 2000 team was not as good as the previous two teams and will seek to make some significant changes. What effect those changes will have on their payroll will be one of the off-season sports to follow.</p>
        <p>MacPhail, who has experienced World Series success with the Minnesota Twins but has never had the Yankees' kind of money to work with, said he believed the Yankees would find it difficult to keep winning the way they have the past few years.</p>
        <p>''As well as they have been operated and how many resources they have, they'll go though a brief down cycle,'' he said. ''Such is the nature of the game.''</p>
        <p>An executive of another club noted that the Yankees used many of their better minor-league prospects for their in-season trades this year and might not have many left to use in future trades.</p>
        <p>''Now they may have to do it totally with money,'' he said.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner has never been shy of using that method, even though he may have a payroll limit. If he does, on the other hand, no one has discovered it.</p>
        <p>Bowden was asked if he ever fantasizes about having a $100 million payroll.</p>
        <p>''Of course,'' he said. ''I'm a general manager.''</p>
