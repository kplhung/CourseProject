        <p>The former manager of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's disbanded Senate campaign said yesterday that the campaign would transfer ''hundreds of thousands of dollars'' to state campaign committees for New York Republican candidates next week.</p>
        <p>The manager, Bruce J. Teitelbaum added that the campaign had already given $6,000 directly to Representative Bob Franks, the Republican Senate candidate in New Jersey, and $10,000 to Joan B. Johnson, the Republican candidate for Rick A. Lazio's seat on Long Island.</p>
        <p>The campaigns for Mr. Franks and Ms. Johnson confirmed the contributions last night.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giuliani still has about $3.5 million in the bank from his abandoned race against Hillary Rodham Clinton. Although a number of state Republicans have said that the mayor should give the bulk of that money to state and national Republican candidates, as he is allowed to do by law, a Republican close to Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that Mr. Giuliani had no intention of doing that.</p>
        <p>''Giving all his money away is absurd,'' the Republican said. ''It would be folly. Money is power in politics. By preserving some of his cash, he preserves his options.''</p>
        <p>There is some speculation that Mr. Giuliani might run for governor in 2002. The mayor has also expressed an interest in running for mayor again in 2005.</p>
        <p>Mr. Teitelbaum said that Mr. Giuliani's campaign had given money directly to some Republican incumbents who are considered vulnerable. Mr. Teitelbaum said the mayor had given $7,500 to State Senator Guy J. Velella of the Bronx; $5,000 to State Senator Frank Padavan of Queens; and $5,000 to State Senator Thomas P. Morahan of Rockland County. He has also given $1,750 each to 10 Assembly candidates.</p>
        <p>Although the total contributions are not as large as many state Republicans would like, they are nonetheless an attempt to spread political good will and influence on behalf of the mayor. Mr. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May, citing his prostate cancer, there remains some anger in the party over his protracted decision and the turbulence in his personal life at the time. On May 10, Mr. Giuliani announced that he was seeking a separation from his wife, Donna Hanover, then two days later took a public stroll with another woman, Judith Nathan.</p>
