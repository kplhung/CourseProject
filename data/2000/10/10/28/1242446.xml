        <p>As a die-hard Mets fanatic, I'm disappointed that the team didn't accept Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's invitation to take part in Monday's ticker-tape parade down the Canyon of Heroes in lower Manhattan to honor the World Series champions.</p>
        <p>Why? As any true Mets fan knows, the Mets actually won the Subway Series.</p>
        <p>True, if all you're looking at are the final ''scores'' of the five World Series games, the Yankees were, technically speaking, the ''winners,'' but only in the narrowest sense of the word. To determine who really won the World Series, one has to look beyond the scores to the numbers that really count:</p>
        <p>Which team was host to more Subway Series games at its stadium? The Yankees played host in the first two World Series games at Yankee Stadium, but the Mets, in a stunning comeback, held the last three games at Shea Stadium. By this measure, the Mets edged the Yankees, 3-2.</p>
        <p>Which team had more players named Franco? The Yankees failed to produce a single player named Franco in any of the five Subway Series games, while the Mets, in the clutch, came through with two key Francos, John and Matt. Mets win, 2-0.</p>
        <p>Which team had its players' names on the backs of their jerseys? In this key contest, the ''we're-too-cool-to-have-our-names-on-our-shirts'' Yankees were no match for the clearly labeled National League squad. Mets win, 1-0.</p>
        <p>Which team inspired more use of rhyming slogans? The ''Let's/Mets'' rhyme featured prominently in ''Let's Go, Mets,'' while ''Wave Your Hankies for the Yankees'' never really caught on. Mets shut out the Yanks.</p>
        <p>Which team had more players who did not throw a jagged piece of wood across the playing field? In this crucial category, the two teams were very evenly matched; still, the Mets edged the Yankees, 25-24.</p>
        <p>Which team was the answer to the five questions above? The Mets win again and this time, most impressively, in a 5-0 sweep.</p>
        <p>Now that I've established, once and for all, that the Mets won the Subway Series, the only remaining question is whether or not the Yankees will decide to show up at next week's parade. Personally, I hope they do. Otherwise, they run the risk of looking like sore losers.</p>
