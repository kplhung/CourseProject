        <p>Mexico's antitrust commission said it began a formal proceeding against Coca-Cola to determine if it was guilty of monopolistic practices in Mexico. Coke, which had a 64.6 percent share of Mexico's $5 billion soft drink industry last year, has been accused by competitors of placing unfair exclusivity demands on stores that stock its products. The decision comes after representatives of the commission and Coke failed to negotiate an agreement. The affair has led to a dispute between Coke and PepsiCo Inc., the company that had accused Coke of violating fair trade practices. Coke said Pepsi refused to negotiate a settlement, but Pepsi said Coke refused to accept its latest offer.</p>
