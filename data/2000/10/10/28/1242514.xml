        <p>Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton engaged in a quarrelsome hour of bickering and badgering in their final debate yesterday, as they attacked each other's ethics, commitment to Israel and proposals to improve the nation's education system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton turned their third and final encounter of the Senate race in New York into the political equivalent of a food fight, barking out insults, citing damaging newspaper accounts about each other's alleged misdeeds, and repeatedly talking over each other.</p>
        <p>The moderator, Gabe Pressman of WNBC, seemed at times amused -- though at times startled -- by the rancorous display between a first lady and a member of Congress that was unfolding within the hushed confines of a third-floor television studio at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. [Excerpts, Page B8.]</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio suggested that Mrs. Clinton's support for a Palestinian state, as well as what he asserted was her association with radical Palestinian leaders, had threatened Israeli security and undercut the peace process. Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Lazio of trying to avoid a discussion about his positions on health care and the economy by raising what she asserted were false claims about her commitment to Israeli security.</p>
        <p>They accused each other of playing politics on everything from legislation to finance breast cancer treatment to abortion.</p>
        <p>But the substance of the debate -- and there was some -- was frequently drowned out in the theatrics of the moment: Mr. Lazio turned red and angry as Mrs. Clinton criticized his ethics for taking contributions from the housing industry, and Mrs. Clinton folded her arms and looked sternly at him as he blamed her for the quality of schools in Arkansas.</p>
        <p>''Can I just try to get the truth through for one moment please, Gabe?'' Mr. Lazio said during one of a number of rounds in which both candidates demanded the floor from Mr. Pressman.</p>
        <p>''You don't know where to start with Mr. Lazio. He does go on,'' Mrs. Clinton said at another point, with what appeared to be an exaggerated exhibition of exasperation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pressman, 76, who has been moderating debates in New York politics since 1965, seemed like the teacher trying to take control of an unruly classroom for much of the session. ''Order, please, order!'' Mr. Pressman demanded. The request often went unheeded.</p>
        <p>The debate was taped yesterday afternoon at WNBC studios and broadcast last night. The two candidates are seeking to succeed Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who is retiring after serving four terms in Washington.</p>
        <p>In a departure from the previous debates, where both candidates stood behind lecterns, Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton sat at a round table with Mr. Pressman, with bookshelves at their backs. The absence of lecterns or any time limits lent itself to something of a free-for-all. And by now, both candidates were experienced enough with debating, and with each other, that both seemed comfortable in the setting and primed for a fight.</p>
        <p>Of the three debates, yesterday's was nearly as quarrelsome as the first one. Mr. Lazio was noticeably more combative than he was in the second debate, perhaps reflecting the pressure he may feel because of polls that show him slightly trailing Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>In this environment, it was hardly surprising that Mr. Lazio seemed startled midway into the debate when Mr. Pressman, reading from a series of e-mail news releases sent out by each campaign attacking the other, inquired if the two candidates disliked each other.</p>
        <p>''It's not a matter of personal dislike,'' he finally said. He returned to what was his standard campaign speech, suggesting that the main differences between them were philosophical -- until Mrs. Clinton cut him off.</p>
        <p>''This is what's called a filibuster, Gabe,'' she said. Mr. Pressman then asked Mrs. Clinton to name three things she liked about Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>After hesitating a moment, she responded, ''It seems like he has a very nice family. And that he, you know, has worked very hard. And that, you know, he's an attractive young man.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who is a very youthful 42-year-old, gazed back at his opponent and said: ''Well, I think you're an attractive woman. And I think you've got a very nice family. I'm sure you're a very good mother as well.''</p>
        <p>There was, at that, roars of laughter from the supporters of both candidates who had joined reporters to watch the taping on video monitors that had been set up in another studio, which is normally used by ''Saturday Night Live.''</p>
        <p>At another point, Mr. Lazio became infuriated as Mrs. Clinton suggested -- ''Let me perhaps enlighten you on his record,'' she said to Mr. Pressman -- that Mr. Lazio had taken campaign contributions in return for supporting a bill that weakened consumer protections on factory-made housing.</p>
        <p>While it is true that Mr. Lazio accepted donations from housing industry executives in the late 1990's, the final bill that passed this year was modified to address concerns raised by consumer groups and the AARP, an alteration that Mrs. Clinton failed to mention when she attacked Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>''That is absolutely false, and you know it Mrs. Clinton,'' Mr. Lazio said, a flash of anger in his eyes. ''Please, do not make up things.''</p>
        <p>She responded by citing a report in The Daily News, but was interrupted by Mr. Lazio: ''Let me tell you something, Mrs. Clinton: In eight years, there's one thing that I will not tolerate, and that's being dragged down into the mud. My reputation is impeccable. My integrity is impeccable. Never in my life has anybody accused me of doing a single thing because of who supported me.''</p>
        <p>The first lady got her own opportunity to display anger at Mr. Lazio when he attacked her record on Israel, noting that she had been an early supporter of the creation of a Palestinian state and had raised $50,000 at an event sponsored by a Muslim American group. The group's president has been accused of having expressed support for the right of Palestinians to use armed resistance against Israel. Mrs. Clinton decided this week to return the money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio suggested that there was a ''question mark'' next to Mrs. Clinton on Israel. The problem is ''that many people around the world -- and the Palestinian Authority -- looks at you and your comments and your proximity to the White House  and your role in the White House,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''And when you call for a Palestinian state, when you accept contributions from people that support Hamas, when you invite them to the White House, and they're your guests, you send a message out to the world and to the Palestinian Authority that encourages violence to be used as a tool to achieve political ends.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton turned sternly to the camera and noted that she had returned the money. ''I learned that an organization claimed credit for sponsoring a fund-raiser I attended. And it's an organization whose members have made statements that I find offensive and have condemned. And as soon as I found out the facts, I returned all of the money that was raised because I did not want anyone to have a false impression about my strong support for Israel's safety and security.''</p>
        <p>She later said, ''There is no question mark next to me. There's an exclamation point. I am an emphatic, unwavering supporter of Israel's safety and security.''</p>
        <p>The two candidates also quarreled over Mr. Lazio's role in Congressional approval of legislation to finance breast cancer treatment for working poor women. President Clinton signed the bill without a ceremony in part, aides said, because he did not want to give his wife's opponent a prominent stage on an issue that could prove potent with women.</p>
        <p>Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio claimed some credit for the bill getting through, with Mr. Lazio insisting that he was the author of the legislation and had personally pushed it through the House. But the first lady said that her opponent was trying to gain political points with the bill, asserting that he had neglected it until shortly after he entered the race for Senate. ''This bill, which he does try to take credit for, the credit really belongs to the breast cancer advocates,'' she said. ''And in fact, I just don't think that this is a bill that we should be playing politics with.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio interrupted her. ''My opponent is playing politics with breast cancer right now,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Pressman's urging, the candidates returned to the topic of Mrs. Clinton's residency. Mr. Lazio noted, again, that he lived in New York all his life, and that ''you can rest assured no matter what happens with this election, you check on me a year from now,'' and he would still be in the same Long Island home.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also told Mr. Pressman that she intended to stay in New York for ''the rest of my life.'' And to bolster her case that a non-New Yorker can serve the state, she pointed, if in general terms, to a game between two New York teams that had dominated the news here for the past week. ''What I was struck by was how, you know, people who weren't born in New York could deliver for New York,'' she said.</p>
