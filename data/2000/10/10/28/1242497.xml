        <p>With time running out, here is how things stand for Al Gore in heavily Democratic West Virginia: Even among a crowd that had  gotten up extra early to stand in line for his rally on the statehouse steps this morning, a surprising number of people said they were either wobbly in their choice or had already decided to vote Republican.</p>
        <p>A steady trickle of those who came began leaving shortly after Mr. Gore started talking. And when Senator John D. Rockefeller IV told the crowd that Mr. Gore was especially in sync with West Virginians because ''He's an Appalachian, just like us,'' there were groans.</p>
        <p>West Virginia is a place where Mr. Gore should not even have to show up. But with only 10 days to go, he is in a statistical dead heat nationally, and trailing here. Today's banner headline in The Charleston Daily Mail read: ''Bush Leads in New State Poll,'' over an article that showed the vice president down by 10 points in one survey.</p>
        <p>Local Democrats blame the other side for scaring hunters and coal miners. Mr. Gore's low poll numbers, they say, stem from Republican efforts to cast him as determined to take guns away from hunters -- a contention he has repeatedly denied -- because he supports a number of gun safety measures and wants all new handguns registered.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Gore's environmental record has been cast as a negative, a threat to coal miners, though the vice president has in fact pushed for increased health benefits for miners. Neither Mr. Gore nor his critics mention that his own father, Senator Albert Gore Sr., ran a coal company, Island Creek, after he was voted out of office in 1970 and that the company was heavily criticized by environmental groups.</p>
        <p>Still, some here who are not supporting the vice president said they had not been turned off only by these tactics. And the crowd waiting to see Mr. Gore seemed not so much scared as bored.</p>
        <p>Over and over, even people who said they supported Mr. Gore gave this as their sole reason: ''I'm a Democrat.''</p>
        <p>Tom Daugherty, a Realtor, sighed and said, ''He's better than Bush.'' His wife, Chris, a state worker with the division of environmental protection, was even less enthusiastic. ''I don't like any of them,'' she said. ''I want another choice.''</p>
        <p>This was a Democratic rally. But in interviews all over the grounds, it was striking how much more passion came from those who said they were voting Republican.</p>
        <p>Rebecca Willis, who was there to chaperone an elementary school class, said of Mr. Bush, ''I think he's for all the people, where Gore stresses middle class, middle class.''</p>
        <p>Several young people said they were prepared to break with their Democratic parents on Election Day. And a number of colleagues and couples were split along party lines. ''I have liberal politics, so he's really the only choice I have,'' Gary Rezek, a data analyst, said of Mr. Gore. ''It took me a while to decide that, but I think he'll be a good president.'' Mr. Rezek said he almost went for Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate. But ''after seeing him on TV, he didn't seem that enthusiastic, either.''</p>
        <p>Standing next to him, a co-worker, Jason Crowder, said he would definitely vote for Mr. Bush. ''I just want his values,'' he said, adding, ''I just came here to see the vice president. You never get a chance to see that.''</p>
        <p>Except for the comedian Bill Cosby, who mostly encouraged the crowd to vote, the warm-up speakers pulled out all the stops in trying to jolt the audience, repeatedly telling them their way of life was at stake.</p>
        <p>Bob Wise, the Democratic candidate for governor, cried, ''Let the word go forth from every hill and hollow: 'Al Gore for president.' ''</p>
        <p>Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers, was both more dire and more colorful. ''George Bush has been here saying coal miners are for him. They're confused. Coal operators are for him,'' he yelled. He told the crowd that Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, had voted 18 times in Congress to cut benefits for coal miners. Then, in the biggest applause line of the day, he thrilled groups of schoolchildren in the crowd by crudely describing the dimensions of Newt Gingrich's backside.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gore took the microphone, rolling up his shirt sleeves as he began, he laughed and offered special thanks to Mr. Roberts. ''He'll probably be hearing again from Newt Gingrich,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore left no doubt that he was fully aware of his predicament here, telling the crowd that Republicans ''tremble at the thought that all their efforts at confusion won't work and you'll see all their fuzzy-ness.''</p>
        <p>''My home in Tennessee is on the edge of Appalachia,'' he said, and went on to point out that his former Congressional district included parts of Appalachia. ''I've spent many a Saturday night filling out forms related to black lung. I've heard the stories, I've seen the faces.''</p>
        <p>The line drew applause, but one local Democrat suggested that in the most backhanded possible compliment to the Clinton-Gore administration, maybe West Virginians had gotten too comfortable to care. ''They can't stand prosperity,'' said Charlie Hodge, a retired steel worker.</p>
        <p>And on the way out, Mrs. Willis, a Bush supporter coming and going, gave this assessment: ''It ran a little long and my back hurts. I'll have to go home and do a hot tub.''</p>
