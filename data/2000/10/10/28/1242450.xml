        <p>If he were headed to the polls today, Curt Farrison, a real estate broker in the predominantly black neighborhood of South Norwalk, would gladly pull the lever for Al Gore.

''They are an option. It gives you choice. You can take that voucher and turn that into a decent education for your child.''</p>

        <p>If he were headed to the polls today, Curt Farrison, a real estate broker in the predominantly black neighborhood of South Norwalk, would gladly pull the lever for Al Gore. But Mr. Farrison, whose three children are all grown, said he disagreed with the vice president's opposition to vouchers, which would let poor parents use tax dollars to send their children to private schools.</p>
        <p>''Every opportunity to give your children a better life, you take,'' said Mr. Farrison, who is black. He recalled how nearly 30 years ago he and his wife moved from Norwalk to Danbury so their children could attend better public schools. ''That's what the vouchers are,'' he said. ''They are an option. It gives you choice. You can take that voucher and turn that into a decent education for your child.''</p>
        <p>Joseph E. Mann, a Democratic district leader in South Norwalk, is a party loyalist who has never considered voting for George W. Bush. But he disagrees pointedly with Mr. Gore's support for the death penalty. ''I happen to not be for it,'' Mr. Mann said. ''I think there are too many problems associated with it, especially for minorities.'' He added, ''I just don't think it's a deterrent and I don't think it's civilized.''</p>
        <p>In conversations with two dozen black voters in this diverse city of nearly 80,000 people, the death penalty and school vouchers emerged as two issues on which even some of the staunchest Democrats could find reason to disagree with Mr. Gore. And yet, no voters said that a differing view on either of these issues would change their vote -- at least not in the presidential race.</p>
        <p>The conversations, with small-business owners and teachers, government employees and social service workers, clergymen and police officers, suggested a Clinton-style compartmentalization of issues and priorities among black middle-class voters here. The voters, mostly Democrats but also some Republicans, said smaller differences could be put aside in favor of larger considerations, especially concerning the economy.</p>
        <p>''I think the current administration should go back in, no questions asked,'' said Harold McCready, 65, a Republican member of Norwalk's City Council and the owner of the Old Post Liquor Store on Cedar Street. ''When I put my hand into my right pocket -- that's where I keep my money -- when I feel there are greenbacks there all the time, I don't want that to change. And the stock market has been good to me.''</p>
        <p>Cassandra Eaton, a private music instructor, said that as a black woman, she might not see eye to eye with Mr. Gore on all issues, but she considered his policies appealing to the middle class. ''Right now he is offering more for us in the middle class,'' she said. ''I am looking for someone to identify with. Obviously, the racial thing I can't identify with him. But there is something there, I am hoping. He has that edge for me.''</p>
        <p>For this reason, Ms. Eaton said she could put aside her differences with Mr. Gore on school vouchers. As a 60-year-old grandmother of two young boys, 7-year-old Eric and 3-year-old Anthony, Ms. Eaton said she would like to see private school available to them. ''If I could get them in private school through vouchers, I would,'' she said. ''I would want that option.''</p>
        <p>The voucher issue is far less crucial in Connecticut, a state that is firmly in the grasp of Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, than it is in Michigan, a swing state. There, a statewide ballot referendum on vouchers has drawn attention to a philosophical disagreement between Mr. Bush, who supports vouchers, and Michigan's Republican governor, John Engler, who opposes them.</p>
        <p>Although the stakes are not so high here, the issue is still sensitive enough that not everyone feels comfortable speaking about it. Ms. Eaton said she was hesitant to discuss the issue because it was so contentious. Opponents, including Mr. Gore, argue that vouchers would drain necessary resources from public schools, hinder public school reform and hurt the majority of poor students who would remain in public school.</p>
        <p>''It's a very touchy thing,'' Ms. Eaton said. ''Especially when you want the best for everyone. At the same time, when you look at others who can make it on their own, you want the best for your youngsters as well.''</p>
        <p>Geraldine Jean-Louis, a Haitian immigrant who recently became a citizen, paused in the ShopRite parking lot to say that she, too, saw vouchers as an opportunity to get the best for her child. ''My son goes to public school and enjoys it,'' she said. ''But I'd rather have him in a class with 14 or 15 children instead of being in a class with 40 children.''</p>
        <p>Robert E. Burgess, the director of Norwalk Economic Opportunity Now, a local nonprofit social service organization, said he was more concerned about the economy and Social Security but that he did agree with Mr. Gore on vouchers. ''The majority of kids in this country are in public school, and public school will always be needed,'' he said. ''So the voucher will be counterproductive to helping the majority of the children.''</p>
        <p>Giving school vouchers to people and saying, ''You go where you want to go,'' he said, would take money from the public schools. ''There will be no improvement in the public schools,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At age 57, Mr. Farrison, the real estate broker and a Norwalk resident again, is a satisfied man. He has three grown children: a son in the Marines and two college-graduate daughters now embarked on professional careers. Business is steady at the local real estate brokerage that he owns. And if his mind becomes preoccupied these days, it could well be that he is contemplating his 1-year-old grandson or his next game of golf, making him just the kind of happy voter unlikely to throw an incumbent out of office.</p>
        <p>Although he parts ways with Mr. Gore on school vouchers, he says he understands Mr. Gore's criticism of them. ''It's a Band-Aid,'' he said. ''But Band-Aids stop bleeding and they stop infection one day at a time. The true battle is about making the school systems equal. The quick fix-'ems are vouchers, obviously busing, etc.</p>
        <p>''Those are just Band-Aids and any person worth his or her salt recognizes that,'' Mr. Farrison said, adding that Mr. Gore has the right long-term idea. ''He is saying exactly what I am saying. He is saying, 'Let's not use the Band-Aid, let's fix the system.' ''</p>
        <p>But he added: ''In the absence of having the fix in place, let's go with the vouchers. Let's put vouchers on the table and then once we do that, let's put a solid fix on the system. Let's take out the hammer and the nails.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Farrison said he did agree with the vice president on the death penalty. ''How do we make the punishment so horrible that people don't kill?'' he asked. ''I do strongly believe in an eye for an eye.''</p>
        <p>One reason that votes in the presidential race may not hinge on vouchers or the death penalty is that education and criminal justice are largely administered at the state or local level. That point was not lost on Mr. Farrison, who said that despite his support for Mr. Gore, he might not vote for other Democrats running in local races. ''In my opinion, the best way to vote is issue by issue, candidate by candidate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Shelley T. Ragsdale, the owner of the Ragsdale Fuel Oil Company, on West Avenue, said that he had sent one son to public school and the other to private school and recognized the benefits of both systems. But he said that tax dollars should not be made available in the form of vouchers to encourage parents to remove children from public schools. He also said he feared that the poor would not really benefit.</p>
        <p>''People of color will not flourish in this system and people of non-color will flourish,'' he said. Vouchers would barely cover tuition, Mr. Ragsdale said, and many poor parents would not be able to afford to transport their children to the private schools located outside their home neighborhoods. ''They rely on the bus system,'' he said. ''They don't have the wherewithal.''</p>
        <p>Also, he said, the poor children ''would feel out of place'' in the wealthier private schools.''</p>
        <p>The Rev. Albert D. Tyson, pastor of Bethel A.M.E. Church, said he agreed with Mr. Gore on vouchers and planned to vote for him because he favored the Democrats' economic proposals. Mr. Tyson, who is 73, said that his vote for Mr. Gore would not be deterred by his passionate disagreement with the vice president on the death penalty. After all, Mr. Tyson and other voters noted, Mr. Bush's home state of Texas has carried out more executions than any other state.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Tyson said he wished that Mr. Gore had a different view. ''Once a person's life is taken, you can't give it back to them if you have made a mistake,'' he said. ''And the justice system is not perfect, and that disturbs me.''</p>
        <p>Despite such disagreements, the voters interviewed said race relations were better now than they were eight years ago and they suggested that credit belonged to President Clinton. ''I think in every respect the record is good, much better than anyone else's as far as involving minorities in government,'' said Mr. Mann, the local district leader. ''I think there is no doubt that Clinton has been good for minorities, anywhere you want to look.''</p>
