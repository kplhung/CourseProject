        <p>Gov. George W. Bush made it sound like the nuttiest clump of policy granola imaginable.</p>
        <p>''How many of you own a rooftop photovoltaic system?'' Mr. Bush asked crowds at several campaign rallies this week, ridiculing Vice President Al Gore's proposal to give tax credits to homeowners who install solar panels for electricity. His message was that the vice president's approach to tax cuts was convoluted and, to many voters, irrelevant.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Bush did not note was that he included essentially the same proposal when he outlined his energy policy last month. It was on the final pages of a long document, but it was there: a promise, like Mr. Gore's, to give a tax credit of up to $2,000 to homeowners who decided to harness energy from the sun.</p>
        <p>And while Mr. Bush frequently tears into Mr. Gore's ''targeted'' tax cuts for voters who, for example, put money into certain kinds of investment accounts, there are targets in his own proposals.</p>
        <p>He has suggested helping low-income people buy health insurance by giving them tax credits. He has proposed deductions for the purchase of long-term-care insurance, so that people can afford nursing homes down the line. He has called for tax breaks to people who care for elderly parents at home.</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said that to draw any such similarity was to  miss Mr. Bush's larger point: that what Mr. Gore is trying to sell as widespread tax relief comes almost entirely in the form of deductions and credits, leaving many Americans without benefit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, by contrast, would reduce tax rates in every income bracket, in an effort, Mr. Bartlett said, to make sure everybody who pays taxes gets a break.  Mr. Bartlett said the Bush campaign's tax incentives for specific purposes were simply icing on the cake.</p>
        <p>Kym Spell, a Gore spokeswoman, said Mr. Bush was nonetheless indulging in doublespeak.</p>
