        <p>Here amid the steel and concrete canyons, green grass grows. A naked cockspur hawthorn tree stands in new soil, and freshly dug plants bend in the wind.</p>
        <p>But City Hall here seems an unlikely spot for a garden of any variety. Especially 20,000 square feet of garden. On its roof.</p>
        <p>One of a handful of similar projects around the country, the garden is part of a $1.5 million demonstration project by the city to reduce its ''urban heat islands,'' said William Abolt, the commissioner of the Department of Environment.</p>
        <p>Heat islands -- dark surfaces in the city, like rooftops -- soak up heat. That retention can bake a building, making it stubborn to cooling.</p>
        <p>The roof of City Hall, a 90-year-old gray stone landmark on LaSalle Street in the heart of downtown, has been known to reach temperatures substantially hotter than the actual temperatures on the street below.</p>
        <p>For instance, in July, when the temperature on the ground was 75 degrees, it was 110 on the roof, Jessica Rio, a spokeswoman with the Department of Environment, said.</p>
        <p>The garden will provide greenery and shade. And that, say city officials, will save the city dollars on those blistering summer days. The projected savings from cooling is about $4,000 a year on a new roof whose life span is about 50 percent longer than that of a traditional roof.</p>
        <p>The sprawling open-air rooftop garden is being carefully built on a multitiered bed of special soil, polystyrene, egg-carton-shaped cones and ''waterproof membrane'' -- all to keep the roof from leaking, or  caving under the normal combined weight of soil, rain and plant life.</p>
        <p>The design calls for soil depths of 4 inches to 18 inches. When the last plants and seedlings are buried and the last bit of compost laid, the garden will have circular brick steppingstones winding up two hills.</p>
        <p>After a year and a half of planning, the garden was begun this spring; when it is completed sometime next month, it will actually cover only about half the roof of the building, which City Hall shares with the administrative offices of Cook County.</p>
        <p>The county's rooftop turf will be left untouched, officials said, the better to monitor the impact the garden makes on building temperatures and energy costs.</p>
        <p>But the energy savings are only part of the expected payoff.</p>
        <p>''The primary focus of what we wanted to do was to establish this laboratory on the top of City Hall and get people involved and understanding their impact on the environment and how the little things that we do can make an impact on the quality of life,'' Mr. Abolt said, adding that the plants could also help clean the air.</p>
        <p>''Worrying about air quality is not enough. You've got to do something about it. It can't all be done in Washington,'' Mr. Abolt said.</p>
        <p>The rooftop will not be open to the public; about the only people who can catch a glimpse of it -- aside from those city workers with access to the roof and the occasional tour group -- are workers in nearby buildings who are on a floor high enough to gaze down upon it.</p>
        <p>Rooftop gardens, in places where concrete jungles have erased plants and trees, are not new, not even in Chicago. Arms of greenery dangling over terraces or sprouting from rooftops, common in Europe, are becoming more so in the United States as people become increasingly conscious about the environment and the loss of nature amid urban sprawl.</p>
        <p>People want to create their ''own little garden space,'' said Jerry Garden, the land steward for the Chicago Audubon Society, which has donated birdhouses to the City Hall garden.</p>
        <p>According to city officials, what is unique about this garden is the technology and type of public space.</p>
        <p>Mayor Richard M. Daley, who urged the environment department to look into the project after noticing rooftop gardens in Hamburg, Germany, three years ago, has praised the garden as the first of its kind on a public building in the country.</p>
        <p>It will hold thousands of plants in more than 150 species -- wild onions and butterfly weed, sky blue aster and buffalo grass -- to provide data on what species adapt best. Small plants requiring shallow soil depths were chiefly selected.</p>
        <p>Of the $1.5 million in project costs, about $1 million was used to build the  roof on which the garden rests.</p>
        <p>The project was paid for in association with Commonwealth Edison, which settled a long dispute with the city last year and agreed to spend $1 billion by 2004 on improvements intended to increase the reliability of the power company to Chicago consumers. That agreement included the creation of a $100 million ''environmental futures'' fund controlled by the city, which was the source of financing for the rooftop garden.</p>
        <p>Many plants in the garden have been grown in greenhouses and are larger than normal planting size -- something that planners hope will help them survive the winter, said Kevin Laberge, environmental manager for the garden project.</p>
        <p>If all goes well, planners say, the  roof will be a rainbow of glory next summer. For now, Mr. Abolt likens the garden to a hair transplant.</p>
        <p>''The first couple times you see it, you're like, 'Oh, my goodness, it's going to happen,' '' he said. ''Before you know it, this stuff takes off.''</p>
