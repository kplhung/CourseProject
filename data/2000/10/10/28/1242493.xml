        <p>It is called a houri, Arabic for a small workaday boat with an outboard motor that can be purchased for as little as $2,000 in almost any Yemeni port.

        <p>The houri is a low broad-beamed fishing boat, 15 to 25 feet long, made of white fiberglass, with wood seats and an outboard motor. Some have high prows, and others broad flat ones. According to Yemeni investigators, a houri, or a craft much like it, was used in the Cole attack.

        <p>It is called a houri, Arabic for a small workaday boat with an outboard motor that can be purchased for as little as $2,000 in almost any Yemeni port. But after what occurred here this month, the houri may never look the same again, at least to those who grieve for the 17 American sailors killed in the suicide bombing attack on the destroyer Cole.</p>
        <p>The houri is a low broad-beamed fishing boat, 15 to 25 feet long, made of white fiberglass, with wood seats and an outboard motor. Some have high prows, and others broad flat ones. According to Yemeni investigators, a houri, or a craft much like it, was used in the Cole attack. The investigators cite shards of fiberglass and wood found on the Cole and accounts by sailors on watch on the destroyer at the time of the attack.</p>
        <p>Houris are everywhere on the 1,500-mile coastline of Yemen. They are so numerous in the main fishing port at Sirah Island, across the Aden Peninsula from where the Cole has lain listing since the blast, that visitors can arrange to buy one in five minutes, with no questions about the buyer's identity or purpose.</p>
        <p>Along the shore, fishermen mix expressions of sorrow for the American sailors with an air of inhibition. The reluctance to discuss the bombing is partly because Yemeni investigators have been in the area asking about the boat in the attack.</p>
        <p>But there was also something else widely found in Aden since the bombing -- a halting, half-expressed sense of astonishment, sometimes of satisfaction and even pleasure, that a mighty power, the United States, should have had its Navy humbled by two Arab men in a motorized skiff like a houri.</p>
        <p>In Washington, the question is how the United States, with its formidable power and worldwide responsibilities, can increase its chances of foiling attacks like the one on the Cole.</p>
        <p>But a visit to Sirah and what it suggested about the ease with which the Cole bombers might have been able to take one of the first steps in their plan -- buying the boat -- underscored just how difficult finding answers would be. Among the fishermen, there were edges, too, of the mixed feelings found elsewhere in Aden.</p>
        <p>''You have big boats, and look, they are nothing!'' a 17-year-old who gave his name as Mohsen said as he looked out from Aden's main harbor-front at the Cole's hull.</p>
        <p>Remarks like that one, from old and young, from men calloused from lifetimes spent stevedoring to unemployed youngsters playing at open-air pool tables, reflect a perception of something frequently debated in war colleges in the United States.</p>
        <p>A cause of sneaking pride in the developing world as much as it is a source of anguish in the West, it is called ''asymmetrical warfare,'' or simply the potential of small ideologically impassioned groups to surprise and overwhelm an enemy with far greater technology and firepower.</p>
        <p>It is an ancient concept, tracing its origins as far back as the Old Testament account of David's killing Goliath. Long before the Cole, the principle had forced its way back into the forefront of concern among American security and intelligence specialists after a decade of terrorist bombings of American targets that have caused widespread death and destruction.</p>
        <p>Sirah, overlooked by an ancient Arab fort, teems with lithe quick-eyed fishermen with boot-brush mustaches who go to sea in cotton skirts called futas, the villager's everyday dress. At dawn and dusk, they shuttle from their boats to a market, clutching the day's catch of tuna and snapper, as well as rarer species found in the tropical waters between Aden and the Horn of Africa.</p>
        <p>After haggling with fish traders, the boatmen settle down, cross-legged, for sugary tea and gossip at Al Sayaad, a fishermen's cafe.</p>
        <p>For a visitor at Sirah, a tentative deal to buy a 25-foot houri along with a 75-horsepower outboard was completed in the time needed to drink a single cup of tea. After hasty negotiations, the price was set at 925,000 rials, or $5,150. The seller, Muhammad Awad, seemed unconcerned about the buyer's identity or purpose.</p>
        <p>''It'll be no problem,'' he said. ''You want the boat, you have it. You can be fishing in an hour.''</p>
        <p>Not everything in the Cole attack can have been so simple. American officials here have said the attackers were well financed, with patience to prepare the bombing over weeks or months and enough help to rent or buy at least five safe houses, a four-wheel-drive vehicle and a boat trailer and mobile telephones.</p>
        <p>Building the bomb was not child's play, either. American officials have said it was a highly sophisticated ''shaped charge,'' housed in a heavy steel that directed the blast with sufficient power to penetrate the Cole's half-inch reinforced steel hull, designed to withstand a force of 50,000 pounds a square inch, according to the Navy.</p>
        <p>President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen has said ''specialized American agencies'' had told him that the explosive, described by Yemeni officials as C4, was legally available only in the United States and Israel, as well as one Arab country and one ''Islamic country,'' neither of which Mr. Saleh named.</p>
        <p>When it came to installing the bomb in the boat, a carpenter and a welder from Aden are among at least 60 people reportedly suspected in the investigation. The welder, working at a safe house, is widely believed to have helped fashion the covering needed to direct the explosive power. The carpenter is said to have confessed to building wood housing, possibly a false floor, to conceal the bomb. If the boat was a houri, that would not have posed major problems.</p>
        <p>Houris, though small, have a relatively deep draft, capable of carrying more than a ton and a half of fish, tackle and spare fuel beneath the slatted seats, according to the boat chandler on Sirah. Initial accounts by American officials put the quantity of explosives used against the Cole at the equivalent of 400 to 700 pounds of TNT. Subsequent accounts have suggested that the bomb might have been far larger.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saleh's contention has been that the entire enterprise had to have been carried out by terrorists with bases outside Yemen, men whom he described as ''Arab Afghans,'' meaning veterans of the Muslim guerrilla struggle in the 1980's that drove Soviet forces from Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>As the Federal Bureau of Investigation completed its examination today of the Cole and shore sites possibly used by the bombers and began sending home some agents, American officials here and in Washington continued to say that they were not yet certain that the prime suspect in the case was Osama bin Laden, son of a billionaire Saudi Arabian construction magnate, who is accused of inspiring and directing a worldwide ''holy war'' against the United States. But the officials remained cautious, saying proof had yet to be found.</p>
        <p>But after Mr. Saleh's statement, there has been speculation that the F.B.I. might be closer to identifying the culprits than it has announced.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, among the fishermen of Sirah, the thought of what happened to the sailors on the Cole, and to the billion-dollar American ship packed with 21st-century technology, has a sobering resonance.</p>
        <p>''Most of our talk here is fish talk,'' said Nasir Sabaa, 58, a fish trader. ''But we think of the men who died, too, and we are very sorry. It is bad for America. But it is bad for Yemen, too, because the terrorists who want to destroy you want to destroy Yemen, as well.''</p>
