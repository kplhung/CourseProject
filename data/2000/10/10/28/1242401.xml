        <p>Leon Bates devoted most of his Sunday evening recital at Carnegie Hall to American piano music composed in the first half of the 20th century, a part of the literature that has long been the backbone of his repertory. And as a programmatically puzzling side trip, perhaps meant to cleanse the palate between the angularity of Copland's Variations and the dreamy softness of Barber's Ballade, he glanced toward Japan for two brief, gently dissonant works by Takemitsu, ''Rain Tree Sketch'' (1982) and ''Rain Tree Sketch II'' (1992).</p>

        <p>Leon Bates devoted most of his Sunday evening recital at Carnegie Hall to American piano music composed in the first half of the 20th century, a part of the literature that has long been the backbone of his repertory. And as a programmatically puzzling side trip, perhaps meant to cleanse the palate between the angularity of Copland's Variations and the dreamy softness of Barber's Ballade, he glanced toward Japan for two brief, gently dissonant works by Takemitsu, ''Rain Tree Sketch'' (1982) and ''Rain Tree Sketch II'' (1992).</p>
        <p>Mr. Bates began with Edward MacDowell's ''Keltic'' Sonata (1901), a relic from a time when American composers embraced German Romanticism in all its bombastic grandeur. Even in MacDowell's own time, that preference was fading: his younger colleague Charles Tomlinson Griffes was more taken with the picturesque delicacy of French Impressionism, and for composers like Copland, Barber and Ned Rorem, a generation later, the German style was an antique world not worth revisiting.</p>
        <p>Still, MacDowell's music has always kept at least a tenuous foothold in American musical history, and Mr. Bates's assured, thoughtful performance of the ''Keltic,'' with its cascading chords and brawny textures, was a useful reminder that this country's musical tradition began long before Nadia Boulanger began teaching its most promising young composers.</p>
        <p>Having established that, Mr. Bates turned to the music of Copland, one of the earliest and biggest stars of Boulanger's class. When he composed the Variations, in 1930, that class was a recent memory for Copland, and the folksy ballets that made him a household name were more than a decade in the future. Here Copland was exploring the edges of modernist angularity, something he would return to later in his career. Mr. Bates's reading was stolid at first, but he quickly got into the details of the piece and presented them forcefully and with an admirable clarity.</p>
        <p>Where Mr. Bates was most fully in his element, though, was in the three Barber works that closed the program. His graceful, carefully shaped accounts of the Ballade (1977) and Nocturne (1959) preserved the steady rhythmic flow that drives each work, without shortchanging the subtle demands that each makes on a pianist's technique and imagination. In Barber's Sonata (1949), by contrast, the demands are not subtle at all: a mixture of classic forms, 12-tone figuration and pure old-fashioned virtuosity, it is the most galvanic work Barber composed. Mr. Bates tapped into its spirit immediately, contrasting the prickly rhythms, dancing melodies and the chromatic undercurrent of the opening Allegro energico, and then shifting gears easily (from sparkling to dreamy to sizzling) as each of the last three movements required.</p>
        <p>As an encore, he offered a bravura reading of a Gottschalk showpiece, ''The Banjo.''</p>
