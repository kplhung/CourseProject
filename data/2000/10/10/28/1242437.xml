        <p>The media giants Reed Elsevier and the Thomson Corporation are buying Harcourt General for $4.4 billion in cash and the assumption of $1.2 billion of debt, a lower-than-expected price for one of the largest acquisitions in the publishing business.</p>
        <p>The main reason for the low price, analysts said, is that consolidation in the educational and professional publishing businesses -- Harcourt's core -- has progressed so far that there are almost no bidders left. Each of Harcourt's main businesses is dominated by just three or four companies, like McGraw-Hill or Pearson. Almost all potential bidders faced antitrust problems or had balance sheets full from recent acquisitions.</p>
        <p>''If you look at all the potential acquirers, people are already maxed out,'' said Gareth Thomas, an analyst at Commerzbank Securities in London.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the joint acquisition, which will require the approval of antitrust regulators in the United States and Europe, Reed Elsevier has agreed to buy all of Harcourt and then sell about 30 percent of it to Thomson for $2.06 billion in cash.</p>
        <p>Reed Elsevier, a British-Dutch publisher, pursued the deal primarily for Harcourt's legal, scientific, technical and medical publishing businesses. Reed Elsevier is already the largest company in that market by far.</p>
        <p>''The breadth and depth of Harcourt's journals fit well,'' said Crispin Davis, the chief executive of Reed Elsevier. Harcourt is particularly strong in medical journals, where Reed Elsevier is somewhat weaker, he said.</p>
        <p>Reed Elsevier will also retain Harcourt General's elementary and high school publishing business. Harcourt is one of the largest publishers of elementary and high school textbooks in the United States, while Reed Elsevier sells textbooks in other English-speaking countries. At least for the moment, Reed Elsevier will also keep Harcourt's small trade-book publishing operations.</p>
        <p>Thomson, which is based in Toronto, will acquire Harcourt's units that provide online training and testing to adults, as well as its higher-education publishing business.</p>
        <p>Richard J. Harrington, the chief executive of Thomson, said the acquisition satisfied the company's plans to expand into the online training business, a market growing at a rate of about 25 percent a year.</p>
        <p>''The idea of learning after college to improve your wages or your position in business is really driving hard, and businesses are interested in the training and development of their people,'' he said. Harcourt is the second-largest company in online training, behind Smart Force.</p>
        <p>The advent of the online services increased the economies of scale in both higher-education publishing and adult education, he said. As universities customize online curriculums, professors edit their own print-on-demand textbooks and companies contract for online employee testing and training, large educational publishers can spread the costs of the new technology over more products and revenue, he said.</p>
        <p>Thomson expects to cut the expenses of the units it is acquiring by  $75 million a year within three years. The units have a combined annual revenue of about $750 million.</p>
        <p>For Harcourt's chairman, Richard Smith, whose family owns 28 percent of the company's stock, the sale ends a 40-year odyssey through the business world. It began with his father's chain of drive-in movies and included acquisitions in soft-drink bottling, department stores, luxury retailing, insurance, broadcasting and finally publishing. The company acquired the book publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1991.</p>
        <p>Harcourt General, based in Boston, has since sold or spun off most of its assets, including the spinoff of its General Cinemas theaters as GC Companies in 1993 and the spinoff last year of its Neiman Marcus retail chain. GC filed for bankruptcy protection last month, and Harcourt General was saddled with a $100 million liability because it guaranteed some of the movie theater leases, further lowering the company's price.</p>
        <p>Some analysts had expected Harcourt to fetch a price as high as $6 billion, especially if it was sold off in pieces. But for tax reasons, Mr. Smith sought to sell the remaining publishing company as a whole, which made a sale more difficult. The bidding cooled further when the two principal contenders, Reed Elsevier and Thomson, decided to collaborate.</p>
