        <p>The New York Republican State Committee is conducting a telephone campaign attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton's record on issues of importance to Jewish voters, and a Manhattan man who received such a call yesterday described it as push-polling -- a technique disavowed by reputable pollsters in which a caller claims to be doing a survey but asks loaded questions.</p>
        <p>The man, Seth Hulkower, said he was at home about 3 p.m. when he received the call. ''She said she was conducting a survey,'' Mr. Hulkower said.

        <p>The New York Republican State Committee is conducting a telephone campaign attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton's record on issues of importance to Jewish voters, and a Manhattan man who received such a call yesterday described it as push-polling -- a technique disavowed by reputable pollsters in which a caller claims to be doing a survey but asks loaded questions.</p>
        <p>The man, Seth Hulkower, said he was at home about 3 p.m. when he received the call. ''She said she was conducting a survey,'' Mr. Hulkower said. ''And then she launched into, 'Did you know that Hillary Rodham Clinton had been a supporter of a Palestinian state before she decided to run for Senate?' At that point, I cut her off.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hulkower, 42, said he was about to hang up when he became curious about who was paying for the call, which was made from the offices of West Teleservices, a national telemarketing company, in Lubbock, Tex. He said he asked the woman, who said she did not know. He asked to speak to a supervisor, he said, and the supervisor eventually disclosed that the call was being paid for by the Republican State Committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hulkower, who said he is Jewish, said he was familiar with the concept of push-polling and considered the call to be a form of it. State Republican officials said they believed that West Teleservices was doing work on the party's behalf, making calls questioning Mrs. Clinton's record on issues of interest to Jewish voters. But the officials said they did not engage in push-polling and always had callers identify themselves as being from the Republican State Committee.</p>
        <p>The calls are a new twist in the fierce battle in the New York Senate race over the loyalties of Jewish voters, who are traditionally a reliable Democratic constituency but this year are thought by some Republican leaders to be more likely to abandon Mrs. Clinton because of her positions on the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Dan Allen, a spokesman for the New York State Republican Committee, said last night that he was unable to obtain a script of the calls that the committee had made on Jewish issues.</p>
        <p>''We are not doing any push-polling, and the phone calls that we made, we have identified ourselves as coming from the New York Republican State Committee,'' Mr. Allen said. ''We have nothing to hide.''</p>
        <p>Dan McLagan, a spokesman for the campaign of Mrs. Clinton's Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, said he was not aware of the calls.</p>
        <p>Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, suggested that the Lazio campaign was behind the calls.</p>
        <p>''Rick Lazio's campaign promised New Yorkers that it would not push poll,'' Mr. Wolfson said. ''Now we know that isn't true. New Yorkers will absolutely reject Mr. Lazio's desperate tactics.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has sought to bolster her standing with Jewish voters by appearing with prominent Jewish politicians, promoting her endorsement by Jewish newspapers, and speaking out about ensuring Israel's security.</p>
        <p>But as violence in the Middle East has flared, the issues have stayed at the forefront of the Senate race. When the United States did not veto a United Nations Security Council resolution criticizing Israel, Mrs. Clinton disagreed with the move, distancing herself from her husband's administration. Still, Mr. Lazio criticized her, saying that she should have exerted more influence over President Clinton.</p>
        <p>The Republicans continue to point out that Mrs. Clinton voiced support for a Palestinian state and embraced Yasir Arafat's wife during a visit to the West Bank. And this week, there was a new controversy: Mrs. Clinton's decision to return $50,000 in contributions collected at a fund-raiser sponsored by an American Muslim group after some of its leaders were accused of voicing support for radical Palestinian organizations.</p>
        <p>This is not the first time that push-polling has surfaced as an issue in the Senate campaign. In February, the campaign of Mr. Lazio's predecessor, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, accused the Clinton campaign of making calls intended to spread misinformation about the mayor. The Clinton campaign said that it had not done so.</p>
        <p>Push-polling usually arises in frenzy at the end of campaigns, when politicians hope their tactics will not draw scrutiny. Just before the Republican presidential primary last March in South Carolina, Senator John McCain accused the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of using this strategy, which Mr. Bush denied.</p>
