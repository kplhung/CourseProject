        <p>Enda Johnson of Brown, a junior from Ireland who broke his right foot last March during the indoor season, captured the Heptagonal Games Association men's cross-country title, covering the five-mile course at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx in 24 minutes 56.3 seconds yesterday.</p>
        <p>Johnson scored a 25-yard victory over Tom McArdle (25:00.2), a sophomore who led Dartmouth to the team title with 55 points. The Big Green has now won the championship 13 times. Steve Sundell of Columbia (25:11.9) was fifth.</p>
        <p>Sara Tindall, a senior at Brown, retained her title in the women's 3.1-mile race, winning in 17:32.8. Yale won the team championship for the first time since 1989 with 47 points.</p>
        <p>In the Big East Conference championships at Boston's Franklin Park, Keith Kelly of Providence, runner-up a year ago, won in 23:21 to help the Friars regain the team title with 39 points.</p>
        <p>Ann McGranahan of Villanova was the women's gold medalist in 16:59. Megan Guiney, runner-up in 17:03, led Boston College to the team crown with 38 points.</p>
