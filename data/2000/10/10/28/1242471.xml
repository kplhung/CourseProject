        <p>The Yankee Stadium stop on the No. 4 line smelled not so much like victory yesterday as it did like bleach.</p>
        <p>Nuris Rosario, a transit worker, was putting her shoulder into her broom, scouring the last residue of the 2000 Subway Series off the long concrete platform.</p>
        <p>Somehow, though, you could tell that she did not want to wash it all away. It might have been something about her uniform: a bright orange vest barely concealing a pinstriped Mariano Rivera jersey, a pinstriped baseball cap pulled down tightly over her New York City Transit hat.</p>
        <p>''People get off of the train today, and they see me, and they say, 'Yeah, Yankees! Yeah, Yankees! Yeah, Yankees!' '' she said, taking a quick break and keeping a wary eye on her supervisor. ''Everybody on the trains is talking today.</p>
        <p>''Today, I am happy,'' she added. ''Very happy.''</p>
        <p>The Subway Series might have already passed into memory. But there was at least one place yesterday where it seemed to be still going on: in the subway. Or, to be more accurate, on the No. 4 train, and mostly in the Bronx. It also appeared elsewhere, like on a B train near downtown Brooklyn in the morning, where the conductor felt compelled to announce: ''The time is 10:45. Today is Friday, Oct. 27, the day after the New York Yankees win their 26th World Series. Have a good day.''</p>
        <p>Maybe the only place where the series afterglow seemed absent was on that comparative vale of tears known as the No. 7 train. Up and down the line in Queens, there was very little Mets team spirit on display and even less Mets merchandise.</p>
        <p>A 61-year-old apartment building superintendent did have his blue-and-orange hat on, pulled low over his eyes. But when describing how he had come to be a Mets fan, it seemed as if he was trying to rationalize a little. ''I used to live near Highbridge in the Bronx, and there were just too many Yankees fans around there, so I decided to be a Mets fan in 1962,'' explained the man, who gave his name as ''Patrick, just Patrick.''</p>
        <p>Asked why he liked the team, he shrugged and said, ''They were good for an argument.''</p>
        <p>But over on the No. 4 train yesterday afternoon, people who would normally assume their train face upon passing through the turnstile were talking to other people they had never met before. They were swapping sports pages. They were reliving games -- the way people do with favorite movies when they say, ''Remember the scene where Brando. . . ?'' knowing that the other person remembers the scene just as well.</p>
        <p>At the Mount Eden stop, a teenage boy and girl in school uniforms huddled on the end of the platform, making out to the sound of passing trains. They were both wearing Yankees hats, apparently celebrating their team's victory together.</p>
        <p>At the Woodlawn stop, the end of the line, Doreen Rodriguez, Heidi Narvaez and William Torres, transit employees and Yankees fans all, had taped newspaper sports pages -- most prominently The New York Post's one-word headline ''Dynasty'' -- to several steel platform columns, just in case any passers-by forgot what had happened the previous night.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying not to rub it in with people,'' said Ms. Rodriguez, not at all convincingly. ''I know there are maybe a few broken hearts out there.''</p>
        <p>Joseph Dozier, a 24-year-old maintenance man, was making no pretense of subtlety. Decked out in a gray Yankees jersey and dark blue Yankees cap, he was saluting ''all the dudes who I see who are wearing anything with Yankees on it today.''</p>
        <p>''What can I say?'' he said, bounding onto a southbound train at the Yankee Stadium stop. ''It's a joyous occasion. There's not a lot happening in the South Bronx except the Yankees, you know what I'm saying? When you get some positive vibes, you just have to go with it. Enjoy the moment.''</p>
