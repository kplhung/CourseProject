        <p>The ticker-tape parade in honor of the Yankees' World Series victory was scheduled by City Hall yesterday to start at noon on Monday.</p>
        <p>The parade up Broadway in Lower Manhattan, from Battery Place to Chambers Street, is to be followed by a ceremony at City Hall about 2 p.m., with attendance restricted to invited guests. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani predicted yesterday that the parade would attract a larger crowd than any of the 168 parades that have taken place along that stretch of Broadway, known as the Canyon of Heroes, since 1886. Mayor Giuliani recommended that those spectators hoping for a place along the route should arrive at least an hour before the parade begins.</p>

        <p>The ticker-tape parade in honor of the Yankees' World Series victory was scheduled by City Hall yesterday to start at noon on Monday.</p>
        <p>The parade up Broadway in Lower Manhattan, from Battery Place to Chambers Street, is to be followed by a ceremony at City Hall about 2 p.m., with attendance restricted to invited guests. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani predicted yesterday that the parade would attract a larger crowd than any of the 168 parades that have taken place along that stretch of Broadway, known as the Canyon of Heroes, since 1886. Mayor Giuliani recommended that those spectators hoping for a place along the route should arrive at least an hour before the parade begins.</p>
        <p>Al O'Leary, a spokesman for New York City Transit, said the transit agency expected 100,000 additional passengers on subways heading to the parade. Although trains are to be added on all lines serving Lower Manhattan on Monday morning, he advised people to avoid the numbered subway lines (the 2, 3, 1 and 9 on the West Side and the 4, 5 and 6 on the East Side) because of heavy passenger congestion. For those on the East Side, he said, service on the 6 train, which normally goes to Chambers Street, would be extended to Bowling Green to provide more access to the parade route. The best subway service is expected to be on the N, R, A, C and E trains.</p>
