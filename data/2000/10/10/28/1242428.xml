        <p>What moves me most, I think, are not the statistical accomplishments or aggregate power of this team, but rather the postseason personalities of individual players.</p>

        <p>What moves me most, I think, are not the statistical accomplishments or aggregate power of this team, but rather the postseason personalities of individual players.</p>
        <p>Who cannot feel thrilled to watch Andy Pettitte, his face frozen in an intense grimace, refuse to fail? Then there is Paul O'Neill, a personal favorite in my house for years, who ended a fantastic Series on the eve of the anniversary of his father's death and could give a few corporate training courses in the art of closing the deal.</p>
        <p>David Cone, dignified out of the the bullpen. Luis Sojo, cast off like a used tissue after last season, then brought back into the fold and made into a quiet hero. And I bet Joe Torre moved many grown men to tears after the game, when he summoned his wife to the railing, where he rested his head to weep.</p>
        <p>And yet.</p>
        <p>I remember feeling so much more excited in 1996, when the Yankees shook off Atlanta after what appeared to be a sure loss. Of course, that was the team's first title in 18 years, and we walked around the East Village slapping high fives with guys in S.U.V.'s. So why not this year?</p>
        <p>Maybe it was the interminable length of the games. Or perhaps it was the dubious doings of a pitcher from Houston who reminds me that if you're going to be married to the Yankee family, there are going to be some relatives you would rather not associate with. On that note, watching George Steinbrenner's tears, and knowing how he would most likely have behaved had the Series gone the other way, did not exactly warm hearts.</p>
        <p>While the games were nail-biters (if you could stay up long enough to insert fingers into your mouth), the Series as a whole was not, contrary to what the hype makers sold us.</p>
        <p>As in any war, Mets people became all too human. All that believing they claimed to be doing. And poor Al Leiter.</p>
        <p>My friend Kate could not disagree more. If it was indeed the Mets' turn, she reasons, then why didn't they take it? ''They had, in theory, seven games to beat the Yankees. Am I expending any energy feeling sorry for them? No.''</p>
        <p>Some random thoughts: Jeff Nelson -- who was I to doubt you? Please, come for Thanksgiving. Mike Piazza should consider what role that endlessly groomed mustache played in his karma. If Fox wants to win viewers in Minneapolis, the way to do it is not with ''sounds of the game,'' in which we are treated to moronic banter from the dugout. Nor is flying in Fox television actors, placing them in seats that paying fans deserve, and showing promotions for their sitcoms between at-bats.</p>
        <p>On the front page of this newspaper the other day, there was a photograph of a man in Ivory Coast destroying the poster of the overthrown military ruler. He was not sporting a Mets shirt, but rather the pinstripes. Call it cultural commodification, but it is a reminder that the New York Yankees, much like the Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls, mean something to the world about physical power and the will to win, and that in itself keeps me thrilled to be a fan.</p>
