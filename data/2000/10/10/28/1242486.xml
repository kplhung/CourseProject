        <p>The monumental Subway Series had been over for about an hour when a soggy Joe Torre trudged through the third-base dugout runway holding the championship trophy as snugly as he would hold his 4-year-old daughter. Torre carried the trophy into the small manager's office at Shea Stadium, noticed that there were not enough family and friends with him and came back outside to wave more in. It was as if Torre were playing host to a party in his hotel room, again.</p>
        <p>When the Yankees perform in the postseason, the one trait that stands out more than any other is that they are more comfortable than fearful. From the way they extend at-bats to the way they react to mistakes to the way they shout ''dry man'' when they see a player who has not been sprayed with Champagne, the Yankees treat playing in the postseason the way you treat preparing for a vacation.</p>

        <p>The monumental Subway Series had been over for about an hour when a soggy Joe Torre trudged through the third-base dugout runway holding the championship trophy as snugly as he would hold his 4-year-old daughter. Torre carried the trophy into the small manager's office at Shea Stadium, noticed that there were not enough family and friends with him and came back outside to wave more in. It was as if Torre were playing host to a party in his hotel room, again.</p>
        <p>When the Yankees perform in the postseason, the one trait that stands out more than any other is that they are more comfortable than fearful. From the way they extend at-bats to the way they react to mistakes to the way they shout ''dry man'' when they see a player who has not been sprayed with Champagne, the Yankees treat playing in the postseason the way you treat preparing for a vacation.</p>
        <p>We have done this before. This is supposed to be fun. There is a wonderful reward waiting for us if we do things the right way. That is your recipe for two weeks in Maui, and that is the Yankees' recipe for rumbling to another victory in the World Series.</p>
        <p>Now the Yankees did not do everything perfectly while winning their third straight title and their fourth in the last five years, but they were more resilient and more prepared while silencing the Mets in five games. These teams were more evenly matched than that, but the Yankees made what was a close series seem like a rout. They have won 16 of their last 17 World Series games, a stunning streak if it occurs in April. In October, it is a historic run.</p>
        <p>''They played good,'' Mariano Rivera said. ''I mean, they played like a champ. We played better. You know? We made all the good pitches. We did all the things we needed to do and we won.''</p>
        <p>The Series turned before it was even nine innings old. The Mets had a 3-2 lead with one out in the bottom of the ninth in Game 1 and Armando Benitez had a 1-2 count on Paul O'Neill. If Benitez squashed O'Neill, the Mets would have been an out away from becoming the first team to beat the Yankees in a World Series game since the 1996 Braves. For once, the Yankees might have felt nervous.</p>
        <p>But O'Neill fouled off four pitches, and the critical 10-pitch at-bat ended when Benitez fired a high fastball. O'Neill eventually scored the tying run and the Yankees won, 4-3, in 12 innings. It started with a walk, something that can destroy any closer. When Rivera was asked if that blown save immediately turned the Series toward the Yankees, he agreed.</p>
        <p>''Oh, yeah,'' said Rivera, nodding. ''We knew this guy was not going to hold us. Benitez is a good guy and he's a good pitcher, but the playoffs are different. The bullpen, it's even more different. We were aggressive, and when you're aggressive, you get a lot of good things.''</p>
        <p>As much as the Yankees relied on their experience, that does not instantly secure the most important outs in a game. Rivera does. In the last four World Series the Yankees have won, John Wetteland (who was 4 for 4 in 1996) and Rivera have combined for 11 saves in 11 opportunities. Meanwhile, the opposing closers have, amazingly, botched four of five chances.</p>
        <p>Mark Wohlers fizzed when Jim Leyritz went deep in 1996. Scott Brosius did the same thing to Trevor Hoffman in 1998. John Rocker botched the first game of the World Series for Greg Maddux last season. Then Benitez duplicated that this season after walking O'Neill.</p>
        <p>''All you're doing is trying to stay with him,'' O'Neill said. ''You can't give that at-bat away.''</p>
        <p>Simple words, but, in the postseason, not so simple to do. While O'Neill, Derek Jeter and Tino Martinez had patient at-bats, players like Jay Payton and Benny Agbayani and even Edgardo Alfonzo looked overeager. The Yankees had 25 walks while the Mets had 11. Bernie Williams, who has now played in 19 World Series games, intimated that the hectic atmosphere could have been a factor in his slump. So how could the Mets, who had only four players with experience in the World Series, feel comfortable?</p>
        <p>You can talk about the Yankees getting fortunate bounces. Todd Zeile came within inches of hammering two homers, in Games 1 and 2. Payton's throw to the plate in the decisive moment of Game 5 clipped Jorge Posada's thigh. Mike Piazza drilled a ball to deep center field to finish the first Subway Series in 44 years, barely missing the sweet spot of his bat and a possible game-tying homer.</p>
        <p>You can talk about any of these plays, but it would be a loser's lament. The Mets had a tremendous chance to win Game 1, but they failed and they never got up again. The Yankees were the best team and the most experienced team,  and that team won.</p>
        <p>''We win the big ones,'' Rivera said. ''That's why we're so good.''</p>
