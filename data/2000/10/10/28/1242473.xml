        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy has blocked a cherished homegrown administrator from heading the prestigious Bronx High School of Science and, according to an alumnus who has spoken with him, is hoping to recruit someone of the caliber of a Nobel Prize-winning scientist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy, a 1970 graduate of the school, has refused to appoint William J. Stark, a veteran social studies teacher and administrator, to become Bronx Science's principal, although the teacher was the unanimous choice of a search committee of parents, students, alumni, faculty and union representatives.</p>
        <p>Through the Bronx superintendent, Mr. Levy has directed the committee to try again, saying he would like to raise the profile of Bronx Science by picking a more impressive name -- if not a Nobel Prize winner then a university researcher or an ''outstanding'' principal from another school.</p>
        <p>Faculty and parents said yesterday that while they respected Mr. Levy's often-expressed desire to elevate New York City schools, they worried that in this case, he might be getting carried away. Running a public high school, they say, is more like running a fine restaurant than a political campaign, a foundation or a college. At Bronx Science, they say, the importance of spin and public relations pales compared with the mundane ability to deal with cantankerous union officials, powerful custodians and 2,700 needy, if talented, adolescents.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Levy's former math teacher, Deborah J. Stepelman (then Goldstein) has weighed in, gently imploring the chancellor by e-mail, as a ''voice from the trenches,'' to reconsider. And three of the five principals who have headed the school since its founding in 1938  have also championed Mr. Stark.</p>
        <p>''A celebrity and a big name doesn't bring to the school the wisdom and understanding that is necessary for the job,'' said Milton Kopelman, who headed  Bronx Science from 1970 to 1990.  ''I considered myself a schlep and I also considered myself a star.''</p>
        <p>The last principal, Stanley Blumenstein, announced his retirement at the beginning of the last school year. After advertising the job, a so-called C-30 committee, prescribed by the chancellor's regulations, interviewed more than 20 candidates and sent five names in ranked order to the Bronx superintendent of high schools, Norman Wechsler. Mr. Stark was their unanimous first choice, according to Steven Eskow, co-president of the Parents Association.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wechsler then sent two of those names to Mr. Levy. Mr. Stark was one finalist. Mr. Levy rejected both finalists last summer, instructing the committee to start again. In August, Mr. Stark was appointed interim acting principal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy and his deputy for operations, David Klasfeld, did not return several telephone requests for comment. Mr. Levy's spokeswoman, Margie Feinberg, referred all questions to Mr. Wechsler, who also did not return calls.</p>
        <p>However, in an interview with The Riverdale Press, Mr. Wechsler said that ''it would be wonderful'' to find a candidate ''with a doctorate or a Nobel Prize in the sciences, or in research with prestigious universities or people who've had previous experience as outstanding principals.''</p>
        <p>Such a leader, he went on, could enhance the school's reputation, attract new financing and programs and recruit a higher caliber of student.</p>
        <p>''There are some people who feel that over the past number of years, the school may have had more of a challenge in competing with Stuyvesant,'' Mr. Wechsler told The Riverdale Press, referring to Stuyvesant High School, Bronx Science's historic rival.</p>
        <p>And Marshall Jaffe, chairman of the Bronx Science alumni association board of trustees, said that Mr. Levy had told him that ''he wanted someone who had achieved prominence, not necessarily in public education.''</p>
        <p>By state law, Bronx Science must admit students by specialized exam scores. In a recent alumni newsletter, Mr. Stark described how in the 33 years since he had arrived at the school, it had gone from an institution where the students were almost all white and lived in the Bronx to one where more than 50 percent come from Queens, 36 percent are white, 10 percent black, 9 percent Hispanic and 45 percent Asian.</p>
        <p>The school boasts five Nobel Prize winners among its alumni. Other well-known graduates include Harold Brown, the former secretary of defense in the Carter administration; William Safire, the journalist;  E. L. Doctorow, the novelist; Robert Moog, the inventor; Bobby Darin, the singer; and Stokely Carmichael, the black-power advocate later known as Kwame Ture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy was himself an unconventional choice for chancellor, as a former corporate lawyer for Citigroup, and he needed a waiver from state law to get the job. He has made sentimental visits to Bronx Science since becoming chancellor earlier this year, and in speeches, he has become teary-eyed while speaking of public education as a spiritual calling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jaffe, chairman of the Bronx Science alumni association board, said he was troubled that neither Mr. Wechsler nor Mr. Levy had put forward any candidates who had achieved prominence.</p>
        <p>''If you have a person who's really competent, let's hear about him or her,'' Mr. Jaffe said. ''If you don't, and this is a charade or some kind of waiting game, let's end it now.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Mr. Jaffe said, he worried that all the delay was undermining the stability of the school and the reputation of Mr. Stark, whom he described as ''steeped in'' the school's ''culture of excellence and meritocracy.''</p>
        <p>Asked yesterday if he would consider becoming principal of Bronx Science, Dr. Eric R. Kandel of Columbia University, one of three scientists who shared this year's Nobel Prize in medicine, suggested that while he and his fellow Nobel laureates might like to be high school principals, they probably did not have the right skills.</p>
        <p>''I consider leading a school as important as winning a Nobel Prize,'' said Dr. Kandel, the former co-captain of the track team at Erasmus Hall High School. ''But the principal himself should be a teacher, or at least somebody who knows about high school education.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 7, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Oct. 28 about Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy's decision to reject a candidate for principal of the Bronx High School of Science misstated the year that Milton Kopelman, who criticized the decision, took the job. It was 1977, not 1970; he left in 1990.</p>
