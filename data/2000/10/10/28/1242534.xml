      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A television review on Oct. 3 about ''Building Big,'' a five-part PBS documentary about feats of architecture and engineering, misstated the year in which an ill-fated bridge, then the world's longest, was built across the Firth of Tay in Scotland. It was completed in 1877, not 1890. A picture caption with the review misidentified the bridge shown and the date of the scene. It was a recent photograph of the Firth of Forth bridge, also discussed in the documentary, not an 1890 view of the Firth of Tay bridge. A correction prepared on Oct. 3 went astray at The Times.</p>
