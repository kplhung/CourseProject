        <p>Representative Bob Franks opened the final act of his race for the Senate today with a bus tour aimed at driving home his message that he has begun to cut into the lead of his Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine.</p>
        <p>As political theater goes, the props were in place but the house was thin. An immense silver bus carried only Mr. Franks and an aide for most of the trip from here in Somerset County to Newark to Pennsauken and then to a television appearance in Philadelphia, and the audiences at the two public events were closer to  claques than crowds.</p>
        <p>Still, buoyed this week by a narrowing gap in one poll and an unexpected $600,000 from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Mr. Franks said he believed that a race that once looked unwinnable had inched into the might-be column.  And today he devoted his speeches and interviews to hammering his rival for the cost of his proposals and for the tens of millions that Mr. Corzine, a Wall Street success story, has spent on the race.</p>
        <p>At his kickoff rally here, after ticking off a list of Mr. Corzine's ambitious programs for health, education and care of the elderly, Mr. Franks accused his opponent of failing to appreciate Congress's work in balancing the country's books and even providing a surplus.</p>
        <p>''Folks, I helped to balance this budget and I can tell you there's not enough in the surplus to pay for his program,'' Mr. Franks declared, referring to Mr. Corzine. ''His program will wreck the surplus.''</p>
        <p>Although the rally was staged in front of the Somerset Administration Building, with a ready number of political workers inside, the crowd was small enough to be counted by hand -- 41 people, including a contingent of Republican leaders.</p>
        <p>Those leaders included Donald T. DiFrancesco, the president of the State Senate, and Dick Zimmer, the Republican candidate for his old Congressional seat from New Jersey's 12th District.</p>
        <p>Dale Florio, an influential lobbyist in Trenton and chairman of the Somerset Republican Committee, turned the small turnout into a little partisan joke, by blaming Republican successes under Gov. Christine Todd Whitman.</p>
        <p>''I wish we had a bigger crowd, but because of our great governor we have a great economy, and everybody's working,'' Mr. Florio said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, meanwhile, spent this morning in New York City, attending an editorial board meeting at El Diario, the Spanish-language daily, and sitting for an interview on WNNY-AM (1380), an all-news Spanish radio station with a wide audience in northern New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Then, back in New Jersey, Mr. Corzine sat for an interview with  News 12 New Jersey at which he seemed to respond to the concerns of voters that his programs might be too costly by emphasizing that he would not compromise the budget to pay for them.</p>
        <p>While his health care goals early in the campaign were unambiguous --  universal coverage through government insurance and employer mandates -- Mr. Corzine implied that he  would scale back those goals if they jeopardized a balanced budget.</p>
        <p>''We don't need to spend ourselves back into deficits or raise taxes,'' he said on the program ''The Hot Seat.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine also released two new TV commercials today that attack Mr. Franks.</p>
        <p>One, which implies that Mr. Franks -- who generally supports abortion rights -- would back Supreme Court nominees who do not,  casts the election as a choice between ''putting a woman's right to choose at risk with Bob Franks,'' or ''protecting a woman's right to choose with Jon Corzine.''</p>
        <p>The other, which will appear only on Philadelphia TV stations, criticizes Mr. Franks's environmental record in South Jersey, saying his voting in Congress ''puts our families at risk.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks also taped a television interview for the program ''Inside Trenton.'' Like Mr. Corzine, he acknowledged public concerns about spending, and he did so by distancing himself from the large tax cuts proposed by his own party's presidential candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>''Candidly, I am a bit concerned about Governor Bush's tax cuts,'' Mr. Franks said. ''They depend on all those trillions in the surplus being realized year after year.''</p>
        <p>''I don't want to backslide into the days of deficits,'' Mr. Franks said. '' I don't want to go back.''</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the people who met the candidates today or heard them speak offered generally positive views of each.</p>
        <p>Barbara Gallucci, 60, Old Bridge, proved she had paid attention to the TV commercials about Mr. Corzine's homespun prairie boyhood in Illinois. ''He's more of a homebody, a person for the people,'' Mrs. Gallucci said after Mr. Corzine had greeted her at the Peterpank Diner on Route 9 in South Amboy. ''He was born on a farm, and I like the way he'll protect Social Security and work to make prescriptions affordable.''</p>
        <p>Late in the afternoon, residents of The Fountains Adult Residential Community in Pennsauken used the Franks fliers they had been handed to shade their eyes from a bright autumn sun as he again struck his theme -- that Mr. Corzine's lead had narrowed to five percentage points  in the latest Quinnipiac University poll.</p>
        <p>Rose Jacovelli, a resident, appreciated the visit. ''He was good enough to show up,'' she said, ''so that's good enough for me.''</p>
