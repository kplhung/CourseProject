        <p>Vice President Al Gore returned to Pennsylvania today to promote his economic plan for new high-tech jobs, shore up support among traditional Democrats and convince undecided voters that he would assure a prosperous future.</p>
        <p>''When you encounter an undecided voter, tell them the facts but then give them the passion in your hearts,'' Mr. Gore pleaded at a rally here at Carnegie Mellon University. ''Give me your help and give me your votes and give me your heart so I can fight for you, and I'll fight for your future.''</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore returned to Pennsylvania today to promote his economic plan for new high-tech jobs, shore up support among traditional Democrats and convince undecided voters that he would assure a prosperous future.</p>
        <p>''When you encounter an undecided voter, tell them the facts but then give them the passion in your hearts,'' Mr. Gore pleaded at a rally here at Carnegie Mellon University. ''Give me your help and give me your votes and give me your heart so I can fight for you, and I'll fight for your future.''</p>
        <p>Faced with polls that show his lead in Pennsylvania narrowing, Mr. Gore spent much of the day reiterating parts of his economic plan, pledging to eliminate the national debt, target tax cuts to certain middle-class voters and provide tax deductions for college tuition.</p>
        <p>Here and during a morning rally in West Virginia, Mr. Gore also cast himself as a friend of coal miners, lambasted the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush for television commercials that Gore aides said went over the line, and relied on leaders of the steelworkers union and the mine workers union to help promote his candidacy.</p>
        <p>And as he traveled through the industrial heart of the old economy, Mr. Gore spent a significant part of his day talking about the new one.</p>
        <p>''I have a simple approach to the Internet economy,'' he said at the Carnegie Library in Munhall. ''Government should keep its hands off. No burdensome government regulations. No new tariffs on Internet transmissions, and a moratorium on taxes on the Internet. The Internet economy is like the goose that's laying silicon eggs. Let's make sure it stays healthy and well-fed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said his approach to the economy could add 10 million high-tech jobs over the next decade. He said that over the next five years he wanted to double the federal government's spending on research in information technology, and over the next seven years double the amount spent on medical research.</p>
        <p>But all this technology and the new jobs will go to waste, he warned, if people are not educated, and he reiterated his desire to ''make education our No. 1 priority.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's schedule is being stapled together on a moment-by-moment basis. He is campaigning in places where he did not expect to have to compete at this stage. On Saturday, after a morning speech in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., he travels to Washington to watch his son's football game, then is off to Minneapolis and Detroit. On Sunday he plans a bus trip across Michigan, and on Monday a bus trip across Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>Tuesday will see Mr. Gore in California, the most important state and one where Mr. Gore's once commanding lead has also thinned somewhat. He is to tape an appearance for the ''Tonight'' show with Jay Leno. Mr. Bush is appearing on the Leno show the night before. Mr. Gore is also planning a rally in Los Angeles, and he is expected to visit Oregon for the second time in 10 days.</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman, said that the trip to California was ''primarily an opportunity to do the Leno program, which is a great way to speak to a large number of people. Leno and Letterman, quite literally, have become the town squares of the campaign.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's schedule today reflected the renewed urgency that his campaign detects in Pennsylvania and in the Democratic bastion of West Virginia, where coal companies are worried that Mr. Gore's environmental concerns could lead to overregulation of the coal industry.</p>
        <p>Asked about the support for Mr. Gore in Pennsylvania, Terry Madonna, a political analyst at Millersville University, said the vice president was simply losing the personality contest.</p>
        <p>''There is no one big issue for people to focus on, so they have the luxury of looking at the personalities of these candidates,'' he said. ''There are a substantial number of voters in this state, even Democrats, who don't like Gore. It's the only thing that really explains what happened to his campaign.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Madonna said that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush were both moving gingerly around two big issues here, abortion and gun control, and how they affect two important groups in this state -- Republican women in the suburbs who favor abortion rights and white Democratic men in the western part of the state who favor gun rights.</p>
        <p>''Gore's position on abortion helps him in the suburbs, but on gun control, he gets hurt by blue-collar, pro-union, white men in the $25,000-to-$60,000 income bracket, the big, white, Catholic, working-class majority.'' Mr. Madonna said. ''Bush can emphasize his anti-gun control, but that hurts him in the suburbs.''</p>
        <p>The vice president began the day with a rally in West Virginia in front of the Capitol in Charleston, where he practically declared himself an Appalachian.</p>
        <p>''You want somebody who will fight on behalf of the widows of miners,'' he said, pronouncing ''widows'' as ''widduhs,'' accentuating his Southernness as he sometimes does when he is campaigning below the Mason-Dixon line.</p>
        <p>''You want somebody who understands coming from part of Appalachia,'' Mr. Gore said. ''My home in Tennessee is on the edge of Appalachia and my Congressional district that I started representing 24 years ago includes a big part of the district that is in Appalachia, with coal miners. I have spent many a Saturday night in a small courthouse filling out forms related to black lung.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and others noted that Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush's running mate and a former member of Congress, voted 18 times against increasing federal benefits for victims of black-lung disease.</p>
        <p>The vice president also said essentially that the Bush campaign was distorting his positions in television commercials because it was in the grip of special interests.</p>
        <p>''The other side won't say to you plainly that they're in it to fight for the special interests,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Of course not. They fuzz it up, like the math. They will try to use all of the special-interest contributions to put misleading advertisements on the TV screen every few minutes to try to make you think that up is down and black is white and outside is inside.''</p>
        <p>In West Virginia Mr. Gore was joined by Cecil Roberts, national president of the United Mine Workers, who said the coal operators were for Mr. Bush while the coal miners were for Mr. Gore. He was also joined by Richard Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and former president of the mine workers union. Mr. Trumka made a plea for Mr. Gore, and concluded by yelling, ''We know that Nov. 7 is the day that we take back the country!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was introduced by Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, who also vouched for Mr. Gore's devotion to coal. ''When Al Gore says that West Virginia is blessed by an abundance of coal,'' Mr. Rockefeller said, ''he knows the importance of coal, and he knows the importance of that to our future, doing it responsibly but doing it, mining it.''</p>
        <p>In a final plea, Mr. Rockefeller said of Mr. Gore: ''He understands us. He is us.''</p>
