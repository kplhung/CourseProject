        <p>The Nassau County executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, rejected the Legislature's four-year fiscal rescue plan today, saying he could not accept its 15.4 percent increase in county property taxes next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, has until Nov. 6 to actually veto the changes that legislators made to his budget proposal Thursday night. The plan that he submitted last month included a 3.8 percent tax increase.</p>
        <p>But at a news conference today, he said he would use the time to try to forge a compromise with Democratic and Republican legislative leaders -- one that has remained elusive over the many weeks the three sides have worked to prevent a state board from taking over the finances of Nassau, one of the wealthiest counties in the nation.</p>
        <p>Speaking generally, Mr. Gulotta said he would seek more spending cuts to reduce the need for so large a tax increase. Failing that, he said, there would be no other way to change the budget except by veto.</p>
        <p>''I am not approaching this with a threat to veto, even though I realize that could be a possibility if all else fails and we cannot achieve consensus,'' Mr. Gulotta said. ''This tax increase in unacceptable and I do not intend to permit it to stand as is.''</p>
        <p>His comments got a chilly reception from Judith A. Jacobs, the Democratic legislative presiding officer, who led her caucus Thursday night in narrowly passing a $2.2 billion  budget for 2001, as well as a spending plan for the following three years. All 10 Democrats voted for the plan, and all 9 Republicans opposed it.</p>
        <p>''We are not willing to compromise our beliefs,'' Ms. Jacobs said. ''Compromise means that you are stepping away from something that you believe is whole and real. There is nobody in this delegation that would have proposed a 15.4 percent tax increase on the county portion of your tax bill if we felt that this was not absolutely necessary.''</p>
        <p>The plan would increase the county tax bill by $155 a year for the average household. The county property tax makes up 19 percent of residents' overall property tax bills.</p>
        <p>The Democrats said today that their 2001 budget would reduce spending by $145 million, in part by laying off 64 nonunionized county workers, merging several departments and freezing wages for union employees working without a contract.</p>
        <p>But it would still spend $60 million more than Mr. Gulotta had proposed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs said she did not believe that spending could be cut any further without gutting essential services.</p>
        <p>Members of the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, the state board overseeing county finances, said their staff was still reviewing the plan, and refused to comment on it. The board will continue to help the county's elected leaders, said Richard M. Kessel, a member of the state board. But he said Nassau officials must make the final decisions before the board officially weighs in.</p>
        <p>''I don't think NIFA will take any formal action until the county executive has determined how to proceed with the budget that was adopted by the legislative majority,'' Mr. Kessel said.</p>
        <p>At his news conference, Mr. Gulotta stressed the need for cooperation among himself, Ms. Jacobs and Peter J. Schmitt, the leader of the Republican minority in the Legislature, to prevent the state board from  seizing fiscal power from them. And he said he would also seek recommendations from the board, which was created as part of a plan offered in May by Gov. George E. Pataki to bail out the county and restructure its debt.</p>
        <p>Moments after his plea for compromise, Mr. Gulotta was asked a question about a criticism that had been leveled at him by Mr. Schmitt, his fellow Republican. ''Who's Peter Schmitt?'' he replied dismissively.</p>
        <p>Robert W. Lazaro, a spokesman for Mr. Schmitt, declined to respond. But he indicated how far away the Republican delegation was from consensus with Mr. Gulotta by saying, ''We stand by our plan that makes spending cuts its first priority.''</p>
        <p>In his budget, Mr. Gulotta called for laying off more than 300 unionized workers and giving county police officers and detectives 22 percent raises over the next five years in exchange for a total of $60 million worth of savings through concessions.</p>
        <p>Today, he said he was willing to consider raising his tax proposal, but not nearly as high as the 15.4 percent passed by the Democrats. Republican lawmakers, in their 2001 budget proposal, called for a 5 percent increase in county taxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta would not cite specific items in the adopted budget that he would cut. He pointed to his budget proposal -- a proposal the state board, Ms. Jacobs and Mr. Schmitt had rejected -- as a place to find those cuts. But then he refused to say whether he was even committed to those proposals.</p>
        <p>He also would not say whether he would continue to support tentative  contracts he negotiated with two police unions. Regarding the layoffs he proposed, he said, ''I think we would have to take another look at that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta can either accept the Legislature's plan or veto parts or all of it. If he vetoes all the Legislature's changes, the plan he submitted would re-emerge. The Legislature can override any of his vetoes if it musters 13 out of 19 votes.</p>
        <p>The final result would go to the state board, whose members have urged a compromise.</p>
        <p>''All I will say is where there is a will, there is a way,'' Mr. Kessel said.  ''And if the three parties can come together on a consensus budget we will all figure out a way to get there somehow.''</p>
