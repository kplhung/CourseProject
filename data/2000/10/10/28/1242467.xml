        <p>This 30-second commercial, titled ''My Turn,'' was released by Representative Bob Franks, a Republican, in his campaign against Jon S. Corzine for the United States Senate seat from New Jersey.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Smith &amp; Harroff.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The ad opens with flashes of frames from Mr. Corzine's campaign commercials, flickering faster and faster as they fade to black. Mr. Franks, wearing a denim open-collar shirt and a blue blazer, then addresses the camera. The screen then dissolves to a black background with white subtitles and quotations from newspapers amplifying the script: ''Corzine's proposals: 'impossibly expensive,' '' ''Corzine's plan: 'hand the bill to ordinary taxpayers.' '' Mr. Franks reappears, then the screen again fades to black as he concludes his appeal, leaving on the screen only the words, ''Congressman Bob Franks for US Senate.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Bob Franks: ''Jon Corzine spent 60 million bucks to be seen and heard everywhere. Now it's my turn to say something. I'm Bob Franks. Jon Corzine's universal spending proposals would cost billions and cost every New Jersey taxpayer as much as $5,000 a year. His plan would wreck the balanced budget I helped write and raid the Social Security fund I helped protect.</p>
        <p>''I'm Congressman Bob Franks. I'll bring to the Senate experience and values all of Corzine's money can't buy.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Corzine has not yet reached $60 million in spending likely will before Election Day. The quotations are from newspaper editorials in The Star-Ledger and The Trentonian, respectively. But the $5,000-per-taxpayer figure that Mr. Franks cites incorporates greatly exaggerated estimates of the costs of Mr. Corzine's proposals. It was prepared by the House Budget Committee, of which Mr. Franks is a member, and whose chairman, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, is his best friend in Congress. While Mr. Corzine's programs will require billions in new spending, he says they can be paid for without raising taxes or raiding Social Security.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The recycling of the $5,000 tax-increase estimate will only give Mr. Corzine ammunition to attack Mr. Franks's credibility. But Mr. Franks nonetheless manages to accomplish an awful lot in this plainly low-budget ad, which practically screams ''underdog.'' By referring to the balanced budget and Social Security trust fund -- which Mr. Franks dealt with as a member of the House Budget Committee -- he alludes to his own experience, thus finally beginning to articulate a reason for New Jerseyans to vote for him.</p>
