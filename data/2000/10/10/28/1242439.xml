        <p>Steve Flesch is having a fun-filled week, both at the amusement park and on the golf course.</p>
        <p>Instead of worrying about winning the National Car Rental Golf Classic at Walt Disney World, or worrying about Tiger Woods being in contention, Flesch has taken the relaxed approach to this tournament. He has visited the theme parks with his family, and he has refused to practice after each round. After winning more than $1.5 million on the PGA Tour this year, Flesch has decided to reward himself this week for having the best year of his career.</p>
        <p>But if Flesch continues to play well, his reward may be bigger than he imagined. Tying the 36-hole tournament record (128), and pulling ahead of Woods, the world's No. 1 player, Flesch shot a seven-under-par 65 to lead Woods by two strokes after today's second round. Woods, who shot a 67, was in second place at 14 under par. Carlos Franco (65-66) and Duffy Waldorf (65-66) were tied for third place at 13 under par.</p>
        <p>Woods, Flesch and Franco all played on Disney's Magnolia course, where the final two rounds will be conducted. Waldorf played on the Palm course.</p>
        <p>If Flesch were to win this weekend, it would be the highlight of his career. He would win his first event on tour at age 33, capture the $540,000 first-place check and defeat Woods in the process. But Saturday will be a test for Flesch, who will be playing with Woods for the first time in the day's final group and in front of a typically large gallery.</p>
        <p>Flesch insisted he was looking forward to the experience of playing with Woods.</p>
        <p>''I think it will be exciting,'' said Flesch, who has 12 top-10 finishes this year. ''I know, being in Orlando, he is going to have a lot of people rooting for him. I look forward to it. If you are playing with Tiger, you are playing pretty well.''</p>
        <p>Starting the day tied with Woods after an opening-round 63, Flesch made birdies on three of his first four holes and tied the 36-hole tournament record set by Tim Simpson in 1990. A left-handed player who is known for his accurate iron play, Flesch used a hot putter to take the lead today. Three of his seven birdies came on putts of 20 feet or more -- a 20-footer on No. 13, a 20-footer on No. 16 and a 30-footer on No. 6.</p>
        <p>Woods failed to keep pace because he was not as sharp. Woods hit several poor drives, including a wild shot on the par-5 No. 10 that landed well right of the fairway, behind a tree, forcing him to play out sideways to get back into the fairway and settle for par. Woods birdied only one of the four par-5 holes, which is unacceptable by his standards.</p>
        <p>Yet, in a round that had to be considered merely average, Woods still shot a 67. After having already won this tournament twice, including last year, he entered the weekend confident as always.</p>
        <p>''I didn't hit the ball anywhere near as well as I did yesterday, but I putted well,'' Woods said. ''To be honest with you, I didn't play as good as my score would indicate.''</p>
        <p>But while Woods is used to finishing first, winning has been an elusive task for Flesch. His best chance this year came in July at the Advil Western Open, where he was one stroke off the lead with nine holes to play before losing to Robert Allenby.</p>
        <p>''I was staring at the leader board and seeing who was ahead of me,'' Flesch said. ''I started pressing a little bit.''</p>
        <p>To beat Woods, and to win the tournament, Flesch will have to do a better job of handling pressure. And while many of his peers expect him to eventually win on tour, Flesch would love to break through sooner, rather than later.</p>
        <p>''I take it as a compliment that people have enough faith in my game to believe I can win out here,'' Flesch said. ''I believe I can. The time just hasn't come for me yet. I think if I work on my patience, everything will happen. As long as I keep playing well, I'll get a win.''</p>
