        <p>State Senator Mary Hartley, a Democrat, is campaigning door-to-door these days with a virtual bull's-eye on her back. As a Democrat seeking her fourth two-year term in the Arizona Senate, where Republicans have a two-seat majority, Ms. Hartley is one of several incumbents that state Republican leaders have singled out in their fight to maintain control of the chamber.</p>
        <p>Their efforts are nothing new to Ms. Hartley. Her opposition to Republican policies, she said, routinely earns her descriptive epithets from political opponents, as if ''pugnacious'' or ''combative'' were part of her name.</p>
        <p>But here in Ms. Hartley's District 20, as well as in nearly 6,000 other districts in 43 other states, the stakes are the highest in a decade.</p>
        <p>With control of state legislatures in 2001 comes control of the pens that redraw Congressional districts after the 2000 census. The party that holds most power in a state capitol generally prevails in creating safe House seats for years to come. And with the current division so narrow -- 222 Republicans, 209 Democrats, 2 independents and 2 vacancies -- the major parties are spending record amounts this year on state legislative races.</p>
        <p>Kevin Mack, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said that in 1994, the Democratic National Committee had contributed only $250,000 for statehouse races.</p>
        <p>''This year,'' Mr. Mack said, ''we expect to spend $8 million to $10 million.''</p>
        <p>Tom Hofeller, redistricting director for the Republican National Committee, predicted that the Republican party would spend ''about an equal amount.''</p>
        <p>The competition is intense.</p>
        <p>Democrats control 19 state legislatures, compared with 17 in the hands of Republicans. In another 13 states, each party controls one chamber. One state, Nebraska, has a nonpartisan, single-chamber legislature. Political experts predict that a shift of just five seats or fewer in each of 39 chambers would change the control of the legislatures in 29 states.</p>
        <p>That could translate to a swing of dozens of seats in the United States House, making the elections in 2002 far more critical to the long-term balance of power in the House than in the elections next month.</p>
        <p>''Legislatures are as even now as they have ever been,'' said Tim Storey, a policy analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures. ''But if current trends continue, Republicans could lock in a strong advantage for the next 10 years.''</p>
        <p>As recently as 1990, Democrats controlled both chambers of the legislatures in 30 states, with 6 controlled by Republicans and 13 split.</p>
        <p>In the next two election years, the Democrats' advantage began unraveling. By 1994, when Republicans gained control of Congress for the first time in 40 years, similar changes were under way at the state level. Republicans went into the elections that year controlling 8 state legislatures and emerged with 19. The Democrats have since regained two states.</p>
        <p>Now, with 5,910 of 7,424 seats in 44 states up for election this year, many political experts say the competition for control is so close in so many states that it is impossible to predict which party will benefit from redistricting. (Six states do not have legislative elections this year.)</p>
        <p>The line-drawing efforts are all the more important in the states that are expected to gain or lose House seats in 2002 because of population shifts to the South and West. Two independent political groups, Polidata and Election Data Services, project the same results: that Arizona and Texas will pick up two seats each and that California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia and Nevada will each gain one seat.  The groups predict that New York and Pennsylvania will lose two each and that Connecticut, Illinois, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma and Wisconsin will each lose one.</p>
        <p>Each major party has its own list of state chambers that are critically important to win this year, and the parties agree on several, including the following:</p>
        <p>PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE -- With Republicans in firm control of the Senate and Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican, in office for two more years, the Democrats desperately need to win the state House to keep Republicans from redistricting in a way that could overturn a one-seat edge that  Democrats have in the state's 21-member House delegation. The State House seats are evenly divided (100 to 100) between the two parties, with three seats vacant.</p>
        <p>How eager are the national parties to win control? When a special election for a vacant seat in Scranton was held in June, Vice President Al Gore campaigned in the district; President Clinton recorded radio commercials; and Governor Ridge, along with other notable Republicans, made local appearances. With nearly 17,000 people voting, the Democratic candidate, Jim Wansacz, won by 752 votes over the Republican, Tom Parry.</p>
        <p>MICHIGAN HOUSE -- As in Pennsylvania, a Republican is governor: John Engler in Michigan's case. Republicans control the Senate, and Democrats have an edge (10 to 6) in the United States House. But with all 110 State House seats up for election, Democrats need to overcome the Republicans' 6-seat majority, or Republicans will control redistricting for the first time in 20 years.</p>
        <p>WISCONSIN SENATE -- Wisconsin has a Republican governor, Tommy G. Thompson, and a split Legislature, with Republicans in firm control of the House and Democrats clinging to a one-seat edge in the Senate. Democrats hold 5 of the 9 United States  House seats. With 16 of the 33 State Senate seats up for election, Democrats are expected to hang onto their majority.</p>
        <p>TEXAS SENATE -- A victory by Gov. George W. Bush could actually help the state's Democrats increase the party's 17-to-13 advantage in the Washington delegation. If Mr. Bush wins, his lieutenant governor, Rick Perry, a Republican, will become governor for two years until the next election. But the Texas Constitution provides that Mr. Perry's successor will be chosen by the Senate, in which Republicans hold a one-seat margin, with 15 of 31 seats up for election this year. The competition is so intense that in the race for the only open Senate seat, the Democratic and Republican candidates say they have raised a total of $3.3 million.</p>
        <p>If Democrats win the Senate, choose a Democratic lieutenant governor and keep control of the State House, as is expected, the party would have greater influence over redistricting for a Congressional delegation that could grow by two seats.</p>
        <p>Here in Arizona, the primary focus is on the State Senate, in which all 30 seats are being contested. At least a third of the Senate races are considered too close to call. Seven senators cannot run again because of term limits, and three others are resigning. Otherwise, Republicans abound. They are expected to retain control of the House, where they have an  advantage of 40 seats to 20, and Gov. Jane Dee Hull, a Republican, has two more years to serve.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hartley, 46, said that with population growth expected to give Arizona two new Congressional seats,  Democrats would be ''in deep guacamole for decades'' if the Republicans held onto the State Senate. With no control over redistricting, the Democrats would be unlikely to add members to a House delegation of six that now includes five Republicans.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hartley is one of several incumbent Democrat state senators  considered vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Her challenger, Craig Savage, the only black Republican running for a seat in the Legislature, is promoting school vouchers as a way to ''break the cycle of poverty.'' It is a message, Mr. Savage said, that resonates among many of the Hispanics and blacks who make up a majority in the district, a working-class area in central and west Phoenix. Ms. Hartley opposes school vouchers.</p>
        <p>Until this year, Republicans never felt they had a chance to win the seat, but now they do, Mr. Savage said.</p>
        <p>''Ideally, it would help us get an additional seat in the Senate,'' he said, ''but even if it helps us keep the majority, it's just as important.''</p>
