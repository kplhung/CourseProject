        <p>President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan halted construction today on a nuclear power plant that had been championed by the country's former officials and had come to symbolize the wide gulf between them and the new president.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Chang Chun-hsiung, who announced the decision, said building a fourth nuclear plant in Taiwan was unnecessary and would create unacceptable environmental and safety hazards.</p>
        <p>''We have to make a rational, responsible and conscientious choice for the sake of Taiwan's posterity,'' Mr. Chang said. ''I believe that today we can tell our children that we made a brave and correct choice.''</p>
        <p>The decision, though expected, enraged the Nationalist Party, which Mr. Chen swept out of power in March after a half-century in power. The Nationalists said the $5.5 billion project was critical to Taiwan's economy and reputation among foreign investors.</p>
        <p>Souring the atmosphere further, Mr. Chen had just met the chairman of the Nationalists, Lien Chan, who had urged him to hold off on a decision. The project, in a northern coastal town, Kungliao, is one-third complete and has already cost $1.4 billion.</p>
        <p>''What they did was illegal,'' said Wang Jyng-ping, the speaker of the Parliament and a Nationalist official. Mr. Wang said the legislature would consider trying to censure or impeach the leaders.</p>
        <p>The decision is a blow to foreign companies, including General Electric, which has a $1.8 billion contract to supply a reactor. Prime Minister Chang said Taiwan would compensate the contractors.</p>
        <p>Since taking office in May, Mr. Chen has tried to reach out to the Nationalists, who still dominate the legislature. But he has been hamstrung by his party, the Democratic Progressive Party, and by promises he made in his campaign. One was to scrap the project, which is bitterly opposed by environmental groups.</p>
        <p>''This was a major test of Chen's political will,'' said Andrew Yang, secretary general of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies, a research organization in Taipei, Taiwan's capital. ''There was no compromise on this issue. Chen himself had to make the choice, and this was his choice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yang predicted that the suspension of the project would further hobble Mr. Chen's ability to govern. Among his first moves as president, Mr. Chen chose a Nationalist official, Tang Fei, as prime minister. But Mr. Tang resigned several weeks ago, in part because he opposed efforts to halt the nuclear plant.</p>
        <p>''The old wounds haven't healed, and new wounds are being created,'' Mr. Yang said.</p>
        <p>The announcement also rattled the business community. Stock prices in Taipei fell 2.3 percent, despite heavy government intervention to stem the decline. Rumors that the project was about to be scrapped hit the market just before it closed, adding to the slide.</p>
        <p>''Certainly, some people will be shocked and negatively impacted,'' said James Lin, general manager of Union Bank of California in Taipei.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lin said the government had convincingly demonstrated that Taiwan would have an adequate power supply until 2007, even without a fourth nuclear plant. Mr. Chang estimated that shelving the project would cost the state power authority $2.3 billion to $2.8 billion.</p>
        <p>In the heat of the lobbying campaign, several Taipei newspapers reported that the United States had pressed Taiwan to go ahead with the project. The American Institute in Taiwan, Washington's unofficial embassy in Taipei, denied that it had sought to influence the government.</p>
        <p>''The major concern for the U.S. is that contract provisions that have been agreed upon are fulfilled in either case, whether the construction of the power plant is continued or is halted,'' the institute said in a statement this month.</p>
