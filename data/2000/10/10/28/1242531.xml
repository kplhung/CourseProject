        <p>A front-page article on Sept. 23 about intervention by the world's major central banks to support Europe's unified currency, the euro,  misstated the record high of the dollar against the German mark. The 1985 figure, above 3 marks, was not the record; the dollar was as high as 4.2 marks in April 1956. A reader's e-mail message in late September about the error was initially mis directed at The Times, and this correction was further delayed by efforts to verify past price data.</p>
