        <p>There was plenty to think about in the program presented by American Ballet Theater on Thursday night at City Center. Three of the four works made distinctive statements about the art of classical ballet. The fourth had nothing to do, at least superficially, with ballet.</p>
        <p>Robert Hill, a longtime Ballet Theater principal and a gifted teacher, has an eye for dancers and a refreshing curiosity about the classical idiom. All nine performers in his recent ''Baroque Game'' look less like a cast than a lovingly chosen assembly of technical whiz kids with strong individual presences. And Mr. Hill tests them on both scores, with hard-driving dance that ranges from dramatic stillness and sensual, clinging lifts to lickety-split turns that send the dancers careering about the stage.</p>

        <p>There was plenty to think about in the program presented by American Ballet Theater on Thursday night at City Center. Three of the four works made distinctive statements about the art of classical ballet. The fourth had nothing to do, at least superficially, with ballet.</p>
        <p>Robert Hill, a longtime Ballet Theater principal and a gifted teacher, has an eye for dancers and a refreshing curiosity about the classical idiom. All nine performers in his recent ''Baroque Game'' look less like a cast than a lovingly chosen assembly of technical whiz kids with strong individual presences. And Mr. Hill tests them on both scores, with hard-driving dance that ranges from dramatic stillness and sensual, clinging lifts to lickety-split turns that send the dancers careering about the stage.</p>
        <p>Better programming might have made it easier to absorb ''Baroque Game,'' the last of three dances before intermission. Essentially a piece built around two couples (Julie Kent and Angel Corella, and Michele Wiles and Giuseppe Picone), ''Baroque Game'' is handicapped by its score by Dmitry Polischuk. The music is mired in its own soaring, crashing circuities. The dance wanders from one near-climax, one emotional state and one technical test to another with no clear end in sight.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hill's exploration of technique and idiom is never unrewarding. And he draws wondrous dancing from his cast, which also included Oksana Konobeyeva, Sascha Radetsky, Herman Cornejo, Carmen Corella and Ilona McHugh.</p>
        <p>It seems we will have to make do with ballet companies dancing the work of Martha Graham, given the tragic inactivity of the Graham troupe these days. Is the Ballet Theater production of ''Diversion of Angels,'' staged for the company by Takako Asakawa, an authentic Graham experience? The answer must be no. The Ballet Theater dancers have not trained in the very different Graham technique, though it is unlikely that Graham dancers of today move like the ones who performed the piece at its premiere in 1948.</p>
        <p>This ballet version is an authentic dance experience, however, that invariably draws spontaneous sighs of pleasure from audiences as the curtain falls. The Ballet Theater dancers move with their whole torsos, lacking the urgent earthy thrust of the Graham diaphragm. But ''Diversion of Angels,'' set to an exalted score by Norman Dello Joio, is one of Graham's most luminous, airy pure-dance pieces and so comes close to the airborne aesthetic of ballet.</p>
        <p>Stella Abrera danced the woman in white with a Grahamlike spiritual intensity and nicely hard-edge lyricism. Her partner, Marcelo Gomes,  had a fine complementary rock-hard solidity. The lead cast was completed by Sandra Brown and Isaac Stappas as the dramatic Couple in Red and Erica Cornejo and Herman Cornejo, who are siblings, as the flighty Couple in Yellow. Sean Stewart, as the Fourth Man, found a third, seeming instinctual way of performing the work, merging his elegant ballet body line with all-out dancing that pushed the parameters of the choreography in a way that had little to do with ballet.</p>
        <p>Harald Lander's ''Etudes'' was choreographed the same year as ''Diversion of Angels'' but looks much older in its enjoyably corny purported examination of the training of ballet dancers from the first plie to gasp-inducing pyrotechnics. The cast was headed by Paloma Herrera, Joaquin de Luz and Maxim Belotserkovsky, all of whom turned in solid but unsparkling performances.</p>
        <p>The program was completed by the third-act pas de deux from ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' danced with a delicious appreciation of ballet manners by Susan Jaffe and Vladimir Malakhov. David LaMarche and Ormsby Wilkins were the evening's conductors.</p>
