        <p>Gov. John G. Rowland said today that he planned to end Connecticut's $2.2 million annual contract for auto safety inspections with the company that performs them, after seven of the employees were charged this week with taking bribes from drivers in return for clearing vehicles with safety defects.</p>
        <p>The seven inspectors, employees of the company, Environmental Systems Products Inc., based in East Granby, Conn., were arrested on Tuesday after state investigators said the employees had solicited and accepted bribes of $50 to $80 from drivers whose vehicles had safety problems like bald tires.</p>
        <p>In one case, state investigators said, a safety inspector broke a car's headlight and asked the owner for a bribe to ignore the broken headlight and certify the car as safe.</p>
        <p>All seven employees worked at inspection stations in Thomaston and Bridgeport, Conn., two of the 25 stations that Envirotest, a subsidiary of Environmental Systems, operates in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Today, the state's acting commissioner of motor vehicles, Gary J. DeFilippo, sent a letter to Enivronmental Systems, notifying it of the state's intention to cancel the contract. Mr. Rowland said that the company had 30 days to respond to the letter and that the state would end the contract shortly afterward.</p>
        <p>''It's my intention to make sure that Envirotest is not going to be in the vehicle inspection business,'' Mr. Rowland told reporters this morning. ''As far as I'm concerned, they'll be out of the business as soon as possible. They've had two warnings; that's plenty.''</p>
        <p>About 150,000 vehicles 10 years and older are tested each year under the contract.</p>
        <p>The state's action does not affect a second contract with Envirotest, for a separate program to test vehicle emissions. Those tests are conducted on 1.1 million autos annually under a contract that ends in June 2002 and that state officials said was worth $22.6 million a year.</p>
        <p>Dean Pagani, the governor's press secretary, said that despite Mr. Rowland's loss of faith in Envirotest, trying to cancel its emissions-testing contract would not make sense because soliciting new bids would take at least a year.</p>
        <p>''There would probably be a federal penalty if we just scrap the program,'' Mr. Pagani said. ''We have to have some kinds of emissions program.''</p>
        <p>Environmental Systems Products, which operates hundreds of emissions-testing stations in 11 states and British Columbia, said it planned to increase its surveillance of employees, cooperate fully with the state motor vehicles inspectors who work at each station and increase the reward offered to employees who report wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>''We take this whole situation very seriously,'' said Richard P. Webb, Envirotest's executive vice president and chief operating officer. ''Foremost in my mind right now is doing everything possible to restore the public confidence in the program.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Webb said he had requested a meeting with state police officials on remedies for the problems.</p>
        <p>The state has held contracts with Envirotest for six years, and the company has been the subject of criticism and dispute for almost as long. The governor in 1994, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., awarded the inspections and emissions contracts to Envirotest, overruling the motor vehicles commissioner, who had chosen another company.</p>
