        <p>At a key meeting today, directors of Gazprom, the world's biggest natural gas company, voted to tighten control over management in a move to halt what many directors say has been a loss of assets.</p>
        <p>Pushed by the Russian government, which is the company's biggest shareholder, Gazprom's directors voted to require management to seek board approval for any sales or share issues. Company shareholders have grown increasingly concerned that Gazprom is losing value through asset sales and the issuance of new shares on conditions unfavorable to the company.</p>
        <p>''Obviously management is very nervous,'' said Boris Fyodorov, a member of the board representing minority shareholders. ''The decision on control of assets is excellent, but it doesn't solve the problem of past deals.''</p>
        <p>The meeting brought the entrenched management of this huge company closer to confrontation with the new government, which has begun to look for ways to revamp the company since taking office this year. The high-profile meeting was postponed until today, to allow President Vladimir V. Putin time to confer with his close aides, who are members of the board.</p>
        <p>Today's resolution would have been unthinkable in past years, when management was less accountable to shareholders and the board met infrequently.</p>
        <p>Gazprom needs to be managed in a new way, and assets need to be assessed and inventoried, said Dmitri Medvedev, chairman of the board, and a close aide to Mr. Putin, in a written interview. Mr. Medvedev agreed to the interview only on the condition that questions and answers be in written form.</p>
        <p>As the government moves closer to serious reform in the company and the end of the term of the chief executive, Rem Vyakhirev, nears, shareholders and business rivals say there are indications that company assets are being transferred to subsidiaries, possibly to the benefit of management. Shareholders' concerns are reflected in the company's stock price, which has lagged far behind those of other Russian companies.</p>
        <p>''As a shareholder we're quite concerned about what's happening in the company,'' said Oleg Biryulyov, a fund manager at Chase Fleming Asset Management in London. ''Gazprom transparency is close to zero. How long can this continue?''</p>
        <p>Board members raised questions about a gas company called Itera, which sells natural gas primarily in countries that were once part of the Soviet Union. Itera is widely known to have access to Gazprom's pipelines, even though competing companies say that they cannot get access. But both Itera and Gazprom deny that they have a relationship. Itera will be discussed at the next board meeting, according to Mr. Fyodorov.</p>
        <p>When asked about Itera in the interview, Mr. Medvedev replied that so far, no ties with Gazprom have been proved, but he added that the directors continued to work on the issue, keeping in mind the importance of achieving full transparency in Gazprom's operations.</p>
        <p>Signs that assets have been undervalued are traceable in public records, however. In one example, Itera and a company owned by relatives of Mr. Vyakhirev paid far below market value for stakes in a gas company in which Gazprom had been the biggest shareholder. In the transaction, Gazprom's stake in the gas company fell to 21 percent from 40 percent.</p>
        <p>The deal valued the company, called Sibneftegaz, at $1.7 million, according to Russia's Federal Security Commission. Companies owned by Itera bought 38 percent of Sibneftegaz, while a company owned by Mr. Vyakhirev's brother, Gennadi I. Vyakhirev, bought 5 percent, for a price equivalent to less than a penny for a barrel of oil.</p>
        <p>That's cheap, even by Russian standards. In a comparable transaction this year, the country's biggest oil company, Lukoil Holding, paid about 13 cents a barrel of oil for a group of energy fields, according to United Financial Group investment bank in Moscow.</p>
        <p>Sibneftegaz, which owns gas reserves equal to about 2.3 billion barrels of oil, said the price was fair because the company only owns the reserves and has yet to start producing.</p>
        <p>The management is ''beginning to act like a cornered animal,'' said one Moscow-based banker, who spoke on condition he not be identified. ''This is the test for reform in this country. If they aren't willing to tackle this, then I don't know if there'll be a market here.''</p>
        <p>Gazprom's sheer size makes reform a daunting task. The company is a major part of Russia's economy and foreign policy. It owns a quarter of the world's gas reserves and is by far Russia's biggest company. One out of every five of the country's tax dollars is paid by Gazprom, while its production is equal to more than 5 percent of overall economic output. It supplies Western Europe with 26 percent of its natural gas.</p>
        <p>Board members also asked Mr. Medvedev to propose a way to lift foreign-ownership restrictions in Gazprom. Rules prohibits foreigners from buying local shares, which trade at a far lower price than the shares that trade abroad.</p>
