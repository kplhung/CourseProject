        <p>A student at a Manhattan special education high school has been charged with murder in the shooting death of an 18-year-old man who refused to turn over his silver neck chain, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The student, Victor Moreno, 18, of Sutter Avenue in Brooklyn, was arrested about 10 p.m. Thursday at the 83rd Precinct station house after he had been taken there for questioning, the police said. They said they were led to him through tips from witnesses and from a high school guidance counselor in whom he had apparently confided.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moreno was to be arraigned by this morning on charges of first- and second-degree murder, said a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office.</p>
        <p>The police said that on Tuesday, Mr. Moreno shot Joseph Gallo-Rodriguez, a trainee at a towing company, when Mr. Gallo-Rodriguez refused to give up his necklace, a chain with a crucifix, the authorities said. Mr. Gallo-Rodriguez had been changing a tire on a teacher's car in front of Bushwick High School on Irving Avenue when he was confronted. The teacher was not injured.</p>
        <p>Marta Rojo, the principal of the Manhattan School, the public school on West 52nd Street that Mr. Moreno attends, declined to comment on the arrest. A spokeswoman for the Board of Education, Margie Feinberg, referred questions to the police, saying, ''It would be inappropriate for me to discuss this case.''</p>
        <p>One police official said that the guidance counselor's tip was one bit of information that culminated in the arrest. When speaking with the counselor, Mr. Moreno ''only said a couple of things, but based on everything else, we were able to piece it together,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>Although the police had at first reported that two robbers had approached Mr. Gallo-Rodriguez and then fled after the shooting, it was not clear yesterday whether there was an accomplice.</p>
        <p>''We're still trying to see whether the other person was involved or wasn't involved, or whether the other person may have just been a witness,'' the official said. ''We don't have that other person, so we can't say that person was definitely involved.</p>
        <p>''We have the person who did the shooting,'' the official said, although he added that the police had yet to recover the revolver used in the shooting.</p>
        <p>The official said that Mr. Moreno did not show signs of remorse.</p>
        <p>''The guy wasn't standing here crying, 'I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry.' But that doesn't mean he isn't,'' he said. The victim and the suspect did not know each other, the official said, adding that the shooting was ''definitely over the chain.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gallo-Rodriguez's mother, Joanne Gallo of Starrett City, Brooklyn, said she was saddened but not surprised to hear that an 18-year-old had been arrested in her son's death. ''I figured it had to be somebody young,'' Ms. Gallo said, citing the apparently spontaneous nature of the crime.</p>
        <p>''Other people would be like so angry, but I'm so concerned about that kid's mother,'' Ms. Gallo said yesterday. ''She must be devastated to know what happened.''</p>
