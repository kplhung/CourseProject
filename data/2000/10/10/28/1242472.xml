        <p>The Gore campaign has told President Clinton to steer clear of battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania in the closing days of the presidential race to avoid alienating the swing voters who will play a crucial role in choosing his successor, Democratic officials say.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, a legendary campaigner of his generation, has been invited to several states by Democratic candidates involved in competitive races for Congress.</p>
        <p>But the Gore campaign, to which the president has granted final say on his political travel schedule, has told him to concentrate on efforts to motivate black and Hispanic voters to get to the polls, and to limit his travel to states that the vice president is likely to win, including New York, where Mr. Clinton will appear at a rally on Tuesday for his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton remains highly popular among African-Americans and liberals. But while most other Americans generally approve of his performance as president, polls find his personal appeal among them low. The vice president has been struggling throughout the campaign to keep himself from being associated too closely on the stump with his partner of the last eight years.</p>
        <p>The Gore camp's analysis is that campaigning by the president, even if limited to statewide races, could discourage support for Mr. Gore among swing voters and energize Republicans to turn out on Election Day for Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has engaged in aggressive political fund-raising throughout the country for months, but most such appearances have been at relatively small indoor gatherings after dark, before committed Democrats, rather than in larger public forums.</p>
        <p>In addition to traveling to New York, Mr. Clinton will go next week to Kentucky, where the Gore campaign has approved a visit to help a Democratic candidate for the House, and to California, for two public rallies and fund-raisers for three House candidates. (California has apparently become not so safely in Mr. Gore's column as was previously thought, but Mr. Clinton is very popular there, and his visit was arranged by the state's Democratic governor,  Gray Davis.)</p>
        <p>Other presidential stops under consideration in the closing days of the race include Arkansas and Louisiana, places where the Gore campaign feels fairly confident. But numerous other states are now off limits, say Democratic officials, all speaking on the promise of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Those states include Michigan, where the Senate campaign of Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat opposing a Republican incumbent, Spencer Abraham, sought a last-minute appearance by Mr. Clinton. ''Base turnout in Detroit is very important to winning in Michigan,'' said Carol Turner, Ms. Stabenow's campaign manager, ''and we really believe the president can be helpful with that.''</p>
        <p>The visit has been blocked by the Gore campaign, however, prompting complaints from some local and national Democrats who consider Ms. Stabenow's race critical to their party's hopes of retaking Senate control.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore,'' one Democratic strategist grumbled, ''is not out to win the Senate.''</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Gore have studied polling data in deciding how Mr. Clinton might help, and Michigan is a prime example of the mixed reactions that they have determined a presidential visit would bring.</p>
        <p>In Detroit, where he is extremely popular, the president would help turn out black voters. He would also draw some support in Detroit's well-heeled outer suburbs, given the national prosperity and the vast wealth that the financial markets have bestowed during his tenure. But in the working-class areas around Detroit, middle- and lower-income conservatives would be displeased, on ethical grounds.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign has also determined that Mr. Clinton would be a liability in other parts of the state, like Lansing, a relatively cosmopolitan college town, where he would discourage swing voters that the Gore campaign is counting on. And in Grand Rapids, where there are more conservative Republicans, he would likely energize Bush supporters.</p>
        <p>In Pennsylvania, the campaign of Representative Ron Klink, a Democrat challenging Senator Rick Santorum, also sought the president's aid. But that request, too, has been turned down by Gore aides.</p>
        <p>To be sure, Mr. Clinton will be playing some role in battleground states. In a get-out-the-vote effort, the president has recorded messages that will be sent by computer to the telephones of Democratic loyalists.</p>
        <p>''Hello, this is President Clinton,'' one says. ''I am calling today to talk with you about my friend Al Gore. Michigan is critical in deciding who will lead our country in the new century, so every vote is important.''</p>
        <p>Besides those telephone messages, recorded for use in other states, too,  Mr. Clinton has begun gathering prominent blacks at the White House and urging them to turn out the vote.</p>
        <p>Today, at the first such session, 150 African-Americans from civic, civil-rights and labor organizations gathered in the East Room for a political rally that was officially billed as a budget briefing.</p>
        <p>Behind the scenes, Mr. Clinton is engaged in similar efforts. On Saturday, he will continue with his private telephone conference calls with hundreds of black ministers across the country. The calls are aimed at inspiring the clergy to mention the presidential race in their sermons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton himself will participate in two services at black churches this Sunday morning. At the urging of Senator Charles S. Robb, who is in a tight race for re-election against former Gov. George Allen, he will speak at the 11:45  service at the Alfred Street Baptist Church in Arlington, Va. Earlier that morning, he will speak at Shiloh Baptist Church in Washington.</p>
        <p>Though his itinerary is being restricted by the Gore campaign, the president's associates describe him as itching to hit the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>Given this period of prosperity and peace, Mr. Clinton, at a star-studded fund-raising dinner in New York on Wednesday night, expressed anger and frustration in assessing the state of the presidential polls, say two supporters who were there.</p>
        <p>But when questioned today at a news conference on the budget negotiations with Congress, the president expressed no desire to alter his campaign role and said he believed his focus ought to be on finishing the appropriations process.</p>
        <p>''I've always been happy,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''to do what I could: basically to go out and say what I believe, which is that the country is in better shape than it was when I took office, that we're moving in the  right direction, and I hope we'll build on that instead of reversing it.''</p>
