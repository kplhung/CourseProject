        <p>Hoping to siphon votes from Vice President Al Gore, Republicans in three closely contested states prepared to broadcast a television commercial featuring Ralph Nader, as the candidate himself campaigned here tonight and continued to aim his sharpest barbs at the Democratic ticket.</p>
        <p>Speaking to a capacity crowd at Iowa Memorial Union hall on the University of Iowa campus, Mr. Nader painted Mr. Gore as ''unbelievably subservient'' to corporations and described Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I.

        <p>Hoping to siphon votes from Vice President Al Gore, Republicans in three closely contested states prepared to broadcast a television commercial featuring Ralph Nader, as the candidate himself campaigned here tonight and continued to aim his sharpest barbs at the Democratic ticket.</p>
        <p>Speaking to a capacity crowd at Iowa Memorial Union hall on the University of Iowa campus, Mr. Nader painted Mr. Gore as ''unbelievably subservient'' to corporations and described Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, as ''the quintessential hermaphrodite of American politics -- a Republicrat.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Nader continued to press his case for a third-party movement, describing the two major parties as equally beholden to big business interests.</p>
        <p>The goal for Mr. Nader is simple: he wants to receive 5 percent of the popular vote, so his party, the Green Party, can become a viable third party that qualifies for federal financing.</p>
        <p>In his quest for that percentage, Mr. Nader could drain enough votes from Mr. Gore to hand victory to the Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and the Republicans are now trying to capitalize on that possibility.</p>
        <p>One group, the Republican Leadership Council, has prepared a television commercial in which Mr. Nader attacks Mr. Gore and is ready to broadcast it in Oregon, Washington and and Wisconsin, where the Green Party has made significant inroads among Democrats.</p>
        <p>The commercial features a clip from a speech Mr. Nader made earlier this week. ''Al Gore is suffering from election-year delusions if he thinks his record on the environment is anything to be proud of,'' Mr. Nader is quoted as saying.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign reacted angrily to that advertisement, noting that Mr. Nader also had some choice words for Mr. Bush in the speech (calling him ''nothing more than a corporation running for president disguised as a person'') that the Republicans had left out of the commercial.</p>
        <p>''They've given up all hope of selling Mr. Bush,'' said Kym Spell, a Gore campaign spokeswoman, ''so now they're selling Nader.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader had his own suggestion. ''Why don't the Democrats take my comments on Bush and do the same?'' he said.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Nader campaigned in Iowa today, Mr. Lieberman ran a gantlet of Nader supporters in an impromptu visit to a cafe in downtown Portland, Ore. In impassioned, unscripted exchanges he challenged them to switch their votes, only to be challenged himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman confronted the Nader dilemma head-on, arguing that voting for Mr. Nader would only help Gov. George W. Bush, by draining votes from Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>''I'd urge you to think about how you'll feel on Nov. 8 and you wake up and George Bush has carried Oregon and is president because a lot of people voted for Nader,'' he said to Mike Manning and Bob Anderson, a pair of Nader supporters eating breakfast in the Bijou Cafe, an organic food restaurant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manning, a truck driver, replied, his voice cracking: ''But I have to look in my child's eyes, when they look at me and say, 'Why are species dying?' ''</p>
        <p>He said he found Mr. Bush repellent, but added: ''I will vote for Nader. I've got to think about my conscience.''</p>
        <p>The give-and-take came as Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, quietly let the deadline pass for pulling out of the race for re-election to his Senate seat from Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman is running simultaneously for both offices, a decision that some voters and fellow politicians have criticized as nothing more than a bid for job security.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, at a rally here tonight, Mr. Nader and his supporters continued to talk about their sense that the Democratic Party has betrayed its liberal roots, pointing out its support for the death penalty, the war on drugs, strict new limits on the welfare system and a host of other causes. There was less mention made of the possibility that, by taking votes away from Mr. Gore, Mr. Nader could deliver the election to Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The Democrats, alarmed at the possibility have mounted an aggressive campaign to try to reclaim the votes of people who are leaning Green. Advocates of abortion rights have bought television advertisements warning that a vote for Mr. Nader is as good as a vote for Mr. Bush and could therefore endanger legal abortions. Environmentalists warn about Mr. Bush's record in Texas. And liberal Democrats have been sent to rally the faithful.</p>
        <p>Tonight's rally here drew nearly 1,000 people, many of whom donated $3.50 each for the privilege.</p>
