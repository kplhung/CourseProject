        <p>There are times on the campaign trail these days when what Gov. George W. Bush seems to be offering is less a package of proposed legislation than a seminar on leadership.</p>
        <p>A leader, he tells crowds, does not pit one group of people against another.

        <p>There are times on the campaign trail these days when what Gov. George W. Bush seems to be offering is less a package of proposed legislation than a seminar on leadership.</p>
        <p>A leader, he tells crowds, does not pit one group of people against another. To lead, he says, is to stand firm on convictions, wrap one's fingers around even the thorniest problems and take the long view, no matter what the short-term impact. Variations on those words and themes course through almost every one of Mr. Bush's speeches.</p>
        <p>His vision of Washington looms just as large, but he is not talking about a place on the map. He is assailing what he portrays as misbegotten thinking marked by arrogance, truculence and meddling, and personified in his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>''We're a government of the people, by the people, and for the people,'' Mr. Bush said in Knoxville, Tenn., on Tuesday. ''We're not a government of Washington, for Washington and by Washington.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush addresses specific issues, too: tax cuts, Social Security, Medicare, education. But what is most striking about his stump speech in this final, mad dash toward the finish line of the presidential race is the way in which almost every subject he discusses, almost every claim he makes, bolsters a more diffuse argument about character and tone.</p>
        <p>His Knoxville speech, as close to a standard set of remarks as any he made in the last week, was a perfect example. When he defined the differences between his plan for Social Security and Mr. Gore's, he moved beyond particulars to the assertion that his approach reflected a willingness to think boldly, differently. He insisted that his approach was also, in a sense, humbler, because it would encourage people to have more power over their futures and discretion over their money.</p>
        <p>''But they don't want you to do that in Washington,'' he said, making the last three syllables sound like dirty ones. ''They want the government making decisions for everybody.''</p>
        <p>When he plugged the need to modernize Medicare, he emphasized the importance -- seemingly regardless of the proposal itself -- of steering the legislative process in a civilized, sensible way. ''This is going to require a leader who brings people together,'' he said, ''someone who does not use Medicare as a political issue but someone who sees it as an important priority.''</p>
        <p>The current iteration of Mr. Bush's stump speech, which has evolved considerably in the 16 months since he began his presidential campaign, provides a perfect window into the fundamental questions that dog his bid for the White House and his chosen strategies for answering them.</p>
        <p>How does a candidate beat an opponent who, some polls say, holds positions on issues more closely in line with those of most Americans?</p>
        <p>He turns his approach to those issues into proxies for his governing style, which he says would be more principled and less cynical.</p>
        <p>''The pundits have been saying, you know, that people don't want tax relief,'' Mr. Bush told the crowd in Knoxville, defending his tax-cut proposal, which many political analysts consider a liability. ''You know what my answer is?'' he continued. ''I really don't care what the polls say. I'm standing before you because I do what I think is right.''</p>
        <p>How does a candidate unseat an incumbent administration at a time of extraordinary prosperity? He denies ''Washington'' credit for it, casting that possibility as an affront to the Americans that the federal government serves.</p>
        <p>''Our economy is strong today not because of Al Gore,'' he said. ''Our economy is strong today because we're a land of dreamers and doers.''</p>
        <p>He also insists that the choice before voters is not between jeopardizing prosperity and continuing it, as Mr. Gore claims, but between a shepherd of that wealth whose leadership they can respect and one whose methods are manipulative.</p>
        <p>''I want to remind you of what my opponent said in Los Angeles, California, in his convention speech,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He said to the people out there he is going to make sure the 'right people' get tax relief.''</p>
        <p>''I want you to think about that for a potential president of the United States,'' Mr. Bush added, then liberally translated Mr. Gore's remarks. ''He said, 'Put me in Washington and I'm going to decide who the right people are.' That's not the way we think. That's not the American way.''</p>
        <p>And he promises to end partisan nastiness, implicitly making the case that one of his greatest strengths, an often warm and engaging personality, is not merely a social asset but a political one, with the power to drive a path through gridlock.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't have to be that way in Washington,'' he said, ''where there's finger pointing and name-calling and bitterness.''</p>
        <p>''This country can have a fresh start,'' he added, ''after a season of cynicism.''</p>
        <p>Is he talking about impeachment? Yes, but not by name. That is the sleight of hand in his stump speech, which resurrects bad memories without asking people to relive them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's stump speech also reflects his considerable growth as a candidate. In the beginning, he delivered virtually the same remarks, in the same order, with the same intonation, wherever he went, as if clinging to a life line. Now he confidently rearranges the pieces.</p>
        <p>Every few days, he sets up a teleprompter to deliver a special address that grafts new language onto existing themes. But once the teleprompter goes away, the fresh bits stay lodged in his memory, to be woven into later comments.</p>
        <p>The state of the race is evident in the phase of the speech. A year ago, it was dense with lofty, lovely couplets, as he went about the task of trying to establish eloquent bearings.</p>
        <p>Now, policy details frequently eclipse poetic flourishes, and overt appeals for votes take center stage as the moment of decision nears.</p>
        <p>Twice he beseeched the crowd in Knoxville not only to head to the polls in large numbers but also to persuade ''independent-minded voters or some of those open-minded Democrats'' that he was their man.</p>
        <p>His speech is a delicate balancing act, clearly intended to reassure the conservative faithful that he is one of them while it signals to moderate voters that he is one of them, too.</p>
        <p>So he pitches his tax cut of $1.3 trillion over 10 years, but he dwells only on what it would mean for single mothers making $22,000 a year or families of four making $50,000.</p>
        <p>He frames every discussion about education around the conservative buzz phrase ''local control,'' but he also spotlights the need to make sure that less privileged children and minority students are doing better.</p>
        <p>One aspect of Mr. Bush's speech has proved timeless, and its stamina underscores how firmly he believes that if the election turns on values and character, victory will be his.</p>
        <p>Always, at the close, Mr. Bush envisions his inauguration and the act of putting his ''hand on the Bible.'' He says he will be pledging not only to uphold the laws of the land, but also ''to uphold the honor and the integrity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.''</p>
