        <p>The Swiss engineering conglomerate Sulzer has dropped its plan to merge with Sulzer Medica, one of Europe's biggest medical device companies, after investor criticism led to a decline in both companies' share prices since the deal was announced last month. The proposed merger could not overcome the market's preference for companies that deal only in a single field, Sulzer said. The company will retain its 74 percent stake in Sulzer Medica, which is listed in Zurich and New York, but indicated it was considering a bid for Zimmer, a medical unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb.</p>
