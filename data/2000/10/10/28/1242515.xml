        <p>Sotheby's and Christie's completed an agreement yesterday to pay $512 million to settle claims that they cheated about 100,000 buyers and sellers in a price-fixing scheme dating back to 1992. The civil settlement, to which they agreed on Sept. 22, comes as prosecutors for the Justice Department stepped up efforts to conclude a three-year criminal investigation focusing on evidence that the world's largest auction houses stifled competition by colluding on a wide range of business practices. Last month, Sotheby's pleaded guilty to violating antitrust laws, as did Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's former president and chief executive. Officials at Christie's turned over documents to the Justice Department in January and in return received conditional amnesty.</p>
