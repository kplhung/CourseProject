        <p>From his lesser-known days as lightweight champion to his victory over Oscar De La Hoya in June to capture the welterweight championship, Shane Mosley has focused on boxing. He said yesterday that he was still keeping out distractions for his first title defense next Saturday against Antonio Diaz at the Theater in Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>He wishes De La Hoya would show the same dedication so the two can have their rematch.</p>
        <p>''You can see he's trying to do music and maybe acting and whatever else he's trying to do,'' the 29-year-old Mosley said before a workout at Kingsway Gym in Manhattan. ''I think his priorities are a little out of whack right now.''</p>
        <p>De La Hoya is trying to extricate himself from a contract with the promoter Bob Arum. That leaves Mosley (35-0, 32 knockouts) to search for lower-profile opponents.</p>
        <p>Diaz (33-2, 22 knockouts) is a 24-year-old from the junior-welterweight ranks whose most impressive victory was a knockout of Ivan Robinson on April 15. Robinson had defeated the hard-hitting Arturo Gatti twice.</p>
