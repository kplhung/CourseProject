        <p>I'm starting to question the relationship my priest has with the Maker.</p>
        <p>Before Game 4, I called on the Rev. Mike McHugh to ask him to pray a little harder for the Mets.</p>
        <p>At the 11:45 a.m. Mass at Most Precious Blood Church in Astoria, he wore a Mets cap during the homily. He asked the members of the congregation to bow their heads  if they felt so inclined, to get on their knees and pray for the men in orange and blue.</p>
        <p>Then we lost. On our own field.</p>
        <p>The Mets did not play badly; the Yankees just played better. I believe that adage ''The Lord helps those who help themselves.'' The Mets did little to help themselves in this Series. The games were good, but they lost because they couldn't get that timely hit. And if the Mets don't help themselves this off-season by signing another  professional bat, then you can expect another year of second-place finishes washed down with over-priced beer.</p>
        <p>And what happened to those prayers?</p>
        <p>''Our prayers weren't answered,'' Father Mike told me. ''Maybe God said no.''</p>
        <p>A friend of mine, a Yankees backer, said that he believed God did indeed love baseball, just not Triple A ball.</p>
        <p>My friend is a real wise guy. Smug. A Yankees fan.</p>
        <p>I will admit that over the last week I met some Bombers boosters who are decent people. There was ''Freddy the Fan'' Schuman, 75, banging his pot and pan in the parking lot of Shea Stadium like the kids used to. And even though Mets fans heaped abuse on Freddy, all he would say was: ''You've got your team, I've got mine. Let's just enjoy it while we got it, son.''</p>
        <p>Freddy told me he had never watched a Yankee game with any scintilla of perspective, and then I noticed he was missing his right eye. It was caused by a stickball accident at the age of 9. ''Be happy just to be alive,'' Freddy said. ''All the rest is noise.''</p>
        <p>I suppose. But that's easier to say when your team has won three rings in a row and half the town isn't rubbing your nose in the proverbial dog dung. The whole thing has made me tired.</p>
        <p>I will also admit that I ran into some real losers on the Mets side of the line.</p>
        <p>I saw Game 3 as a working member of the press. Apparently you aren't allowed to cheer in the press box -- something about tradition -- so I left it and wandered through the stadium.</p>
        <p>In the ninth inning with the Mets leading 4-2 and the Yankees fans filing out early, I took a seat in the upper deck.</p>
        <p>I stood next to some old, fat drunk. He was wearing a Mets cap. When Jeter struck out, I turned for the high-five. That's when he stuck his finger deep into my right eye.</p>
        <p>''Now we're even,'' he said.</p>
        <p>I have no idea why he did it. What could I do? ''You're an old, fat, drunk,'' was all I said to the athletic supporter.</p>
        <p>I told this story to Father Mike, who said the only plausible explanation was that the guy was probably a Yankees fan who was so drunk he thought he was a Mets fan.</p>
        <p>I don't believe that, but I still believe. Mets in six in 2001.</p>
