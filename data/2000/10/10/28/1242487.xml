        <p>It is the little things, like the oranges that are showing up on campus again. It is the big things, like Barry Switzer, the favorite son and former coach, showing up on the sideline. It is the familiar things, like talk-radio programs buzzing with all things Sooners. It is the forgotten things, like a big game in October against a bitter rival.</p>
        <p>It is something Oklahoma fans have awaited for 12 long years: the undefeated Sooners (6-0) versus the undefeated Cornhuskers (7-0) on Saturday, with both teams carrying hopes for an Orange Bowl appearance and dreams of a national championship.</p>
        <p>Nebraska is No. 1 in the Bowl Championship Series ranking, Oklahoma No. 2.</p>
        <p>Their rivalry is dotted with great names and bitter history: the coaches Bud Wilkinson and Switzer and the players Joe Washington and Billy Simms on the Sooners' side; Bob Devaney, Tom Osborne, Johnny Rodgers and Roger Craig on the Cornhuskers' side. Nebraska ended Oklahoma's 74-game conference unbeaten streak in 1959; the Sooners have handed Nebraska its only loss of the season five times.</p>
        <p>Nebraska has outscored the Sooners, 179-28, in their last three meetings. Their last game, Nebraska's  69-7 rout in 1997, was the most lopsided in the 78-year history of the series.</p>
        <p>''The key to turning around a program is buying into that program,'' Oklahoma's current quarterback, Josh Heupel, said. ''When you do that, you win games. When you win games, you get respect.''</p>
        <p>Heupel never stops sounding like the son of a football coach, which is what he is; his father, Ken Heupel, is the coach at Division II Northern State University in Aberdeen, S.D.</p>
        <p>After Switzer coached his final game in 1988, the Sooners went through three head coaches, none of whom were able to unite the university's powerful constituencies.</p>
        <p>Switzer's immediate successor, Gary Gibbs, resigned after the 1994 season despite a 44-23-2 record and persevering through two years of being banned from bowl games for National Collegiate Athletic Association violations the program incurred under Switzer.</p>
        <p>Alumni and boosters were unhappy with his 2-15-1 mark against three major opponents -- Texas, Colorado and Nebraska -- and they let him know it by flying planes over Memorial Stadium with banners urging him to move on.</p>
        <p>Howard Schnellenberger, who had won a national championship at Miami, was forced out after a single 5-5-1 season. He tangled with the school's president, David Boren, and alienated his players with a hard-nosed swagger that permeated throughout a staff he had brought with him from his previous job at Louisville.</p>
        <p>The three-year tenure of John Blake, a former Sooners player, was the worst in Oklahoma history. Blake, who was an assistant with the Dallas Cowboys before returning to Oklahoma, shuffled quarterbacks, abandoned his offense and tried to install the wishbone. He was dismissed after compiling a 12-22 record.</p>
        <p>Safety J. T. Thatcher, who started at running back as a freshman under Blake, played in that 1997 loss to Nebraska.</p>
        <p>''There were too many people going different ways.'' Thatcher said of the lean times. ''There was not enough trust.''</p>
        <p>The missteps finally ceased in December 1998, when Oklahoma hired Bob Stoops, then a 38-year-old defensive coordinator for Steve Spurrier at Florida who also helped Bill Snyder rebuild the program at Kansas State.</p>
        <p>Stoops, playing against type, installed something the Sooners' faithful had not seen much of from their own team: a wide-open passing offense.</p>
        <p>''He's been mentored by two widely different coaches in Snyder and Spurrier and taken the best from both of them,'' said Merv Johnson, who was the assistant head coach under Switzer and is now an assistant athletic director at Oklahoma. ''Unlike a lot of defensive coaches, he understood you got to open it up and move the football and score points. He got that from Steve, along with a sense of fun. From Bill he learned the attention to details and a work ethic that makes your assistants and players accountable.''</p>
        <p>Stoops's mantra is balance, an emphasis he attributes to his time with Spurrier. He displays it administratively by holding dinners for his staff and their families every other Wednesday and by scheduling the first meeting of the day for 8:45 a.m., so his coaches can get their children to school.</p>
        <p>He demonstrated it by asking Switzer to speak to his team and stand on the sideline, so the Sooners' glorious past could be linked to their promising future. Stoops also showed it on the field this year when, after a 7-5 season last year, he decided the Sooners needed to run the ball more, to give the defense time to rest.</p>
        <p>The fulcrum on which this on-field balance swings is Heupel, one of the most unlikely Heisman Trophy candidates to emerge in some time.</p>
        <p>Heupel, a senior, began at Division I-AA Weber State in Ogden, Utah. After a season, he transferred to Snow Junior College in Ephraim, Utah. He was an all-American but unwanted by most big-time programs until Stoops's offensive coordinator, Mike Leach, stumbled across Heupel's videotape. Leach knew he had found the right quarterback to run a spread offense, so he called Heupel and left a message on his answering machine, offering him a scholarship.</p>
        <p>Heupel showed up here in January 1999 and so haunted the weight room and cultivated his teammates that he was elected captain four months later. This was before he had played his first game as a Sooner or Stoops had coached his first game here.</p>
        <p>Last season Heupel passed for 3,460 yards and 30 touchdowns, broke 13 school passing records and was named Big 12 offensive newcomer of the year. Leach, now in his first year as head coach at Texas Tech, has called Heupel ''the best quarterback in the country from the neck up.''</p>
        <p>This season Heupel has completed 68.6 percent of his passes while throwing for 1,894 yards and 11 touchdowns. Two weeks ago, in Oklahoma's 41-31 upset of Kansas State, then No. 2 in the Associated Press poll, he got knocked down 14 times and still completed 29 of 37 passes for 374 yards.</p>
        <p>But Heupel also demonstrates why he is considered a thinking man's quarterback. ''The point is to get in the right place and in the right situation and take care of the ball,'' he said. ''If you do that, you're going to have success.''</p>
        <p>There is a chance that Oklahoma, 3-0 in the South Division of the Big 12, and Nebraska, 4-0 in the North, could meet again on Dec. 2 in the conference championship game. But no matter how the Sooners fare on Saturday, Heupel believes he knows where Oklahoma football is heading. ''We need to get back to the level where it has been, where it should be,'' he said. ''The championship level.''</p>
