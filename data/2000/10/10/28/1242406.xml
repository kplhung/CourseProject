        <p>Anna Kisselgoff reviews Marius Pepita's ballet La Bayadere, choreographed by Anna-Marie Holmes of Boston Ballet (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Among Marius Petipa's 19th-century ballets, ''La Bayadere'' was virtually unknown in the West until 1961, when the Kirov Ballet arrived in Paris and the equally unknown Rudolf Nureyev triumphed in a one-act excerpt, ''The Kingdom of the Shades.''</p>
        <p>It is a measure of how much has changed that Anna-Marie Holmes, artistic director of the Boston Ballet, has just added her new staging of a three-act ''Bayadere'' to the other 19th-century classics she has already based so successfully on Kirov Ballet versions. Excellently led on Thursday night by Simon Ball and April Ball, who are brother and sister, the production will be performed through Sunday afternoon at the Wang Theater here.</p>

        <p>Among Marius Petipa's 19th-century ballets, ''La Bayadere'' was virtually unknown in the West until 1961, when the Kirov Ballet arrived in Paris and the equally unknown Rudolf Nureyev triumphed in a one-act excerpt, ''The Kingdom of the Shades.''</p>
        <p>It is a measure of how much has changed that Anna-Marie Holmes, artistic director of the Boston Ballet, has just added her new staging of a three-act ''Bayadere'' to the other 19th-century classics she has already based so successfully on Kirov Ballet versions. Excellently led on Thursday night by Simon Ball and April Ball, who are brother and sister, the production will be performed through Sunday afternoon at the Wang Theater here.</p>
        <p>Yet although the dancing was impressive, with debuts by two soloists who are not yet principals -- Ms. Ball in the title role of the temple dancer (bayadere), Nikiya and Christina Elida Salerno as her rival Gamzatti -- the staging is too miniaturized to achieve the opera-house opulence that can save this white elephant of a ballet from itself.</p>
        <p>For the truth is that even at its premiere in 1877, ''La Bayadere'' was a hybrid work, a transitional ballet in which Petipa did not yet have the unity of style he would show in ''The Sleeping Beauty'' in 1890. Its saving grace is the ''Shades'' excerpt, now well known for its single file of 32 women in white tutus and white veils repeating arabesques and back arches as they descend a ramp. True to the Kirov production, Ms. Holmes has positioned the ramp in  two directions.</p>
        <p>It was not until Natalia Makarova's touchstone staging in 1980 for American Ballet Theater that a Western audience saw this excerpt in context, a full-evening version that harked back to Petipa's original St. Petersburg production.</p>
        <p>Only then could one understand the genius with which Petipa's pure-dance exposition of classical dancing also distilled an expressive core: like Albrecht in ''Giselle,'' the Indian warrior Solor in this scene encountered in the world of the spirits the woman he had loved and betrayed.</p>
        <p>The difference is that ''Shades'' points to the high classical style that a Romantic ballet like ''Giselle'' did not espouse. Trying to discard the Romantic style, Petipa ended up with the melodramatic tinsel and dross that Russian critics have disparaged over the ages.</p>
        <p>Revisions in the Soviet era made the ballet viable and Ms. Holmes has remained true to the Kirov staging, derived from a landmark 1941 version that inserted the now familiar  gasp-producing male solos. In Act I, she has kept the Golden Idol solo  where it belongs, and included the Kirov's dance for Nikiya and a slave (she stands on his bare chest). Kirov dances that Ms. Makarova omitted include a tribal dance (rechoreographed by Ms. Holmes) and a charming dance, ''Manu,'' for Jennifer Gelfand, dancing with a jar and two children.</p>
        <p>Unlike Ms. Makarova, Ms. Holmes follows Kirov practice (since 1920) and discards the last act, in which a temple collapse destroys all. Instead she ends the Shades scene with a  celestial reunion for Nikiya and Solor: a sensible way to tie up loose ends but an anticlimax.</p>
        <p>Ms. Makarova and Nureyev, in his 1992 staging for the Paris Opera Ballet, knew that ''La Bayadere'' can overcome its weaknesses only though an opera house grandeur. Alas, the Wang Theater, a former movie palace, is not an opera house,  and Sergiy Spevyakin's decor, sometimes nicely fanciful in its Indian filigreed motifs, looks cramped.</p>
        <p>Ludwig Minkus's score, conducted by Mark Churchill, is played without  some repeats. Is that why the last Shades actually run down the ramp when they should already be on the floor below? The corps, however, was remarkably disciplined. The Boston Ballet may not have the spectacular dancing of international-rank troupes but Mr. Ball comes close.</p>
        <p>He is a noble dancer, extremely well placed in his positions, as is Ms. Ball. She has a luscious quality to her classical style: both are well trained. Ms. Salerno, as the Rajah's daughter, looked fragile but exuded unexpected power.</p>
        <p>Sergei Berejnoi, Tatyana Terekhova and Tatiana Legat, formerly of the Kirov, staged the work with Ms. Holmes. All did a creditable job, but  ''La Bayadere'' is a work that has to succeed in spite of itself and here it was only partly persuasive.</p>
