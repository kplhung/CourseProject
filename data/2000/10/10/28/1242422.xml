        <p>Sierra Leone has resumed exporting diamonds under a new plan approved by the United Nations, which imposed an embargo three months ago on selling the country's gemstones to keep the revenues from fueling an intensive civil war, industry executives and traders said today.</p>
        <p>The first shipment under the certification program arrived on Thursday in Antwerp, Belgium, the biggest trading center in uncut stones, said Mark van Bockstael, a spokesman for the Diamond High Council in Antwerp, an industry group.</p>
        <p>The stones, often referred to as conflict diamonds, were accompanied by certificates of origin. The program could be a forerunner to a broader global effort to stamp out the $700 million-a-year trade in illicit diamonds that has backed conflicts in Angola, Congo and Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>But diamond traders, advocacy groups and Mr. van Bockstael acknowledged that the system could be circumvented by traders who worked with rebels like those in Angola and Sierra Leone. Those groups can sell diamonds through third countries not limited by embargoes.</p>
        <p>Today, the rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola said that it still controlled one-half the country's diamond trade, rebutting government assertions that the rebels had been pushed out of gem-producing regions.</p>
        <p>Under the United Nations plan, diamonds mined in government-held areas of Sierra Leone are supposed to be scrutinized by government inspectors and sealed for export in packets. The stones are accompanied by certificates of origin whose digital ''fingerprint'' is e-mailed to the authorities in the importing country, usually Belgium or Israel. Mr. van Bockstael said $5 million of rough diamonds were awaiting shipment, more than three times Sierra Leone's official exports last year.</p>
        <p>An American trader based here, Nicolas Karras, who received the first certificate, said the system was flawed because ''conflict diamonds never did go through an organized system in the first place.''</p>
        <p>Rather, rebels illicitly exported stones from areas under their control through neighboring Liberia, which was not under United Nations restrictions on its diamond trading, even though it exports far more diamonds than it is able to extract from its own mines.</p>
        <p>''This is going to make it more difficult'' for illicit diamond traders, Mr. Karras said in a telephone interview from Antwerp. ''There's only one thing that's going to get rid of conflict diamonds, and that's to get rid of the rebels militarily.''</p>
        <p>Alex Yearsley, a spokesman for Global Witness, an advocacy group, said illicit dealers of Sierra Leone stones might have already switched some trading to other West African countries like Gambia and Gabon.</p>
