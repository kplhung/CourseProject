        <p>As debate rages this season about how to spend the federal budget surplus, no one is discussing the real forces that generated it and how to keep them healthy.  Many Americans understand that our unprecedented economic well-being comes from mining the extraordinary vein of basic knowledge laid down by our research universities over the last few decades.</p>
        <p>Why, then, do we hear nothing in the campaign about how the Democrats or the Republicans will ensure new discoveries to keep our prosperity going?</p>
        <p>When I confront a politician with that question, I am told that these issues are too technical and complex for a campaign. I disagree. The issue is straightforward: We must keep replenishing the vein we are mining because, if it runs out, we will have no more of the ore from which technological innovation is created. We must be concerned about both direct financing for basic research projects and maintaining the health of institutions that educate the people who make innovation happen.</p>
        <p>Basic research is often considered to be studies done with no practical goal in mind. It may be very abstract. However, years -- even decades -- after its completion and publication, basic knowledge may suddenly have a great commercial impact. Thus, the health of the American basic science enterprise in the 1950's and 60's generated the huge surge of industrial applications in the 70's, 80's and 90's. We have seen this with the fundamental discoveries in microelectronics, biology, information theory, computer science. These basic sciences generated modern telecommunications, biotechnology, the computer industry and now the Internet.</p>
        <p>The cold war fueled basic research funding for four decades, as we feared that the Russians might outstrip us in science, giving them an edge in military technologies. Our investment paid off, not only in the most sophisticated military the world has ever known, but in our prosperity.</p>
        <p>Were I a politician, I would forcefully state that the vibrancy of the American economy for our children and grandchildren depends on our investment in basic science today. I would insist that the science budgets of the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense be strengthened. The only budget keeping up with the opportunities is that of the National Institutes of Health, and I would pledge -- as Al Gore did for cancer research -- that the momentum would be continued.</p>
        <p>We spend less than half a percent of the gross domestic product on basic science. We should be able to afford to double that amount. Today, the federal government does not even finance the full cost of the research it supports at universities, as a recent RAND study noted, and this forces universities to use their endowment returns to subsidize the research.</p>
        <p>On the education side, the political parties have fallen over themselves championing increased support for kindergarten through 12th grade. I certainly support them. It is higher education, however, that produced the people whose intellectual capital has contributed so decisively to today's prosperity.</p>
        <p>We need to remember that people in training -- graduate students and postdoctoral fellows -- carry out the bulk of the research. Thus more money for research means more apprenticeship training opportunities to nurture the development of the next generation of scientists and scientific entrepreneurs. It is a system that is self-renewing as long as the commitment to it is maintained.</p>
        <p>I am confident that championing scientific accomplishment and higher education would be a vote-winning strategy for Vice President Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. It would be refreshing to see one or both of them adopt it.</p>
