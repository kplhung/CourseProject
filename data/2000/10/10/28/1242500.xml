        <p>A night attendant at a Brooklyn gas station died early yesterday, shortly after he was shot three times in the course of an attempted robbery, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The man, Sedat Kurt, was shot outside the door of a Sunoco gas station on Caton Avenue, in the Prospect Park South section, at 12:20 a.m., the police said. He died at Maimonides Hospital less than one hour later, they said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurt, 43, a native of Istanbul,  was an attendant during the night shift at the full-service station, co-workers said, arriving to work at 6 p.m. and leaving 12 hours later.</p>
        <p>He died from a gunshot to the torso that perforated several major blood vessels, said Ellen S. Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city's chief medical examiner.</p>
        <p>The police said that it was not clear whether anything had been taken or what led the gunman to shoot Mr. Kurt. The gunman wore a ski mask and, after firing several shots, jumped into a dark station wagon driven by another person, the police said. They fled in a station wagon south on McDonald Avenue, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurt's friend and former roommate, Ibrahim Ergin, 39, said the victim had come to America four years ago while working on a cargo ship. ''As soon as the ship came here to the United States, he never went back to Turkey,'' Mr. Ergin said. ''I don't think he planned it. I really don't think so. That's life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ergin, a taxi driver, said he last saw his friend about two weeks ago, when he stopped by the station to fill up on gas. Mr. Kurt had considered returning to Istanbul and buying an apartment with the money he had saved in New York, Mr. Ergin said, but he recently mentioned plans to apply for a green card.</p>
        <p>''He never even went out,'' Mr. Ergin said. ''He was always going from home to work and work to home. He had to take care of his kids in Turkey and his girlfriend's kids here.'' Mr. Kurt sent between $300 and $500 a week back to his wife and children back in Istanbul, his friends said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurt lived with his girlfriend, Yelena Dudel, and her three children. Sitting on a blue felt sofa in their Ocean Avenue apartment, Ms. Dudel said she had always had a bad feeling about her boyfriend's late hours. ''I told him, 'It's a very dangerous job -- just change the job, just change the job,' '' she said. ''But he would say it's good money and that he makes good tips.'' Ms. Dudel said Mr. Kurt had told her that the previous night attendant had quit after being assaulted on the job.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dudel said that she last spoke with Mr. Kurt when he telephoned from work about two hours before the shooting. ''He called me at 10 to say hello and how are you and how the kids were doing, and that's it,'' she said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The owner of the gas station, Morris Yanni, broke into tears as he spoke of his employee, who he said was also a friend. He said that the cash register had not even been opened during the attempted robbery. ''We've had a couple of small things, but this worries me,'' Mr. Yanni said. ''Right now we're full service, but we're going to have to change it to self-service during the night shift.''</p>
