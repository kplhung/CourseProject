        <p>The race for Congress in New York's Second District has plenty of ingredients for great political drama. One of 35 open spots in the close battle for control of the House, the seat is held by Rick A. Lazio, who is giving it up to run for the Senate.

        <p>The race for Congress in New York's Second District has plenty of ingredients for great political drama. One of 35 open spots in the close battle for control of the House, the seat is held by Rick A. Lazio, who is giving it up to run for the Senate. And the Republican candidate, if successful, could be the first black woman from her party elected to Congress.</p>
        <p>But sometimes it is hard to tell exactly what is happening on stage. The two characters with major party roles are unusually close in their views. The unwieldy cast includes three other candidates. And the audience, in a swath of eastern Long Island, is being tugged by two offstage presences: Mr. Lazio and Vice President Al Gore, both of whom appear to be running well here.</p>
        <p>To complicate matters, the Second District -- predominantly middle-class suburbs that include Babylon, a third of Huntington and a small sliver of Smithtown -- has a history of independent voting.</p>
        <p>''This race for me has been like the mystery meat in your grammar school lunch,'' said Amy Walter, an editor of the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter in Washington. ''I just really don't know what to make of it.''</p>
        <p>In some ways, the Republican, Joan Johnson, has waged a high-profile battle, giving a speech at the Republican National Convention and campaigning with Gov. George E. Pataki and Senator John McCain.</p>
        <p>But the campaign of her Democratic opponent, Steven B. Israel, says she is ''in hiding'' -- resisting his requests for more than two debates, and not attending several candidate forums, including ones sponsored by the League of Women Voters and the Gray Panthers of Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>''I missed those because I was someplace else,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''It's so funny that he should mention those 2, when he and I have been to 10 or 12 together.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel's campaign disputes the number of forums Ms. Johnson attended, saying it was far fewer than 10. In addition, some of the Washington political handicappers who could potentially help Ms. Johnson say they have not been able to arrange meetings with her.</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson, 66, may not need the exposure. A resident of the Second District for 38 years, she has been Islip's town clerk for nine years, and last November she won more votes than any other local official, taking 70 percent of the ballots in a town that makes up 51 percent of the district. She won the Republican primary in September with 61 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>''Watch, you're going to see history made in this race,'' she said recently as she accepted the endorsement of the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''I'm going to shock them all, like Jesse Ventura did.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel, 42, a member of the Huntington Town Board since 1993, lived in Nassau County for most of his life, but moved to the district in 1991. In the 1980's, he spent three years in Washington working for members of Congress and says his legislative experience would serve constituents well in Washington.</p>
        <p>He cites his work in Huntington as another qualification.</p>
        <p>''We were Nassau County in 1994, with staggering debt, bonds one step above junk, recurring deficits, budgets passed by default,'' he said, adding that he worked with the Republican supervisor to stabilize taxes, halve debt payments and improve the town's bond rating from the worst to the best on Long Island. The board lowered taxes five years in a row, from 1996 to 2000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel's campaign said that he had raised more than $800,000 for the primary and the general election.  Ms. Johnson said she had raised more than $600,000.</p>
        <p>Polls have been inconclusive: a Republican survey this month showed Ms. Johnson leading by 12 percentage points, while a Democratic poll showed Mr. Israel up by 3 points.</p>
        <p>But party loyalty is not to be counted upon. Although 56 percent of the  voters in the Second District are registered Republicans, the district  sent a Democrat, Thomas J. Downey, to Congress for 18 years, then elected Mr. Lazio, a Republican, in 1992. In 1996, voters re-elected Mr. Lazio by better than a 2-to-1 margin while giving President Clinton a 20-point advantage.</p>
        <p>''Party is almost irrelevant in the district,'' Mr. Israel said. ''People know their way around the ballot. They've proven it in every election.''</p>
        <p>Both candidates realize they may be helped by politicians higher up on their tickets, though those benefits may cancel each other out. Mr. Lazio  remains very popular in the district, but Democratic polls show Mr. Gore running ahead of George W. Bush by 5 to 8 percentage points in the presidential race.</p>
        <p>Perhaps as a result, both Mr. Israel and Ms. Johnson are vying for the political center. Mr. Israel defines himself as ''strongly bipartisan'' and ''fiscally disciplined,'' while Ms. Johnson speaks frequently in favor of building affordable housing.</p>
        <p>Voters are left to choose between a  candidate who favors the Brady Bill requiring background checks for gun buyers, abortion rights and tax cuts for the middle class, and, well, a  candidate who favors the Brady Bill, abortion rights and tax cuts for the middle class.</p>
        <p>There are a few differences.</p>
        <p>''I support paying down the debt to preserve Social Security; my opponent promotes privatizing Social Security,'' Mr. Israel said. ''I support targeted middle-class tax cuts for working families for college or for their parents' long-term care.'' Unlike Ms. Johnson, he supports mandatory trigger locks on handguns.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Johnson points out that she supports only a limited Social Security investment program that would allow people to put about 2 percent of their funds in the stock market. As for middle-class tax cuts, she wants to repeal the so-called marriage penalty in the tax code.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because of the way both candidates lean to the center, they may be susceptible to challenges from other parties.</p>
        <p>The Conservative Party nominee, who beat Ms. Johnson in the party's  primary with 54 percent of the vote, is Richard N. Thompson, a lawyer and former major league baseball player from West Islip. A former Republican, he says he joined the race to give voters an alternative to  what he calls ''the two liberal candidates.''</p>
        <p>''I'm the guy with the platform that appeals to conservatives and independents,'' said Mr. Thompson, 42, who supports using the budget surplus to pay down the national debt, expanding Medicare to pay for prescription drugs and banning the use of soft money in campaigns. He also favors legislation to ban the late-term procedure that critics call partial-birth abortion.</p>
        <p>Robert T. Walsh, 55, of Deer Park, a Republican investment banker who is running on the Right to Life party line, says his experience managing $65 billion in financial services over a 30-year career on Wall Street has prepared him well for Congress. He won 39 percent of the Republican vote in the primary, and calls himself ''the real Republican candidate'' in the race.</p>
        <p>''Joan Johnson has been recognized by everybody in the Second Congressional District as someone who is too liberal for all the people in this community,'' he said.</p>
        <p>David Bishop, 35, a Suffolk County legislator who lost to Mr. Israel by  400 of the 13,000 votes cast in the Democratic primary, endorsed Mr. Israel this month. But his name still appears on the ballot, for the Independence, Working Families and Green Parties.</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson said the presence of so many men in the race is helping her. ''Women say to me, 'Those three guys are going after you -- they're getting you my vote,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>But Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, said that while as a moderate, black, Republican woman, Ms. Johnson presents a compelling profile that can play well locally, her inaccessibility in Washington has been troublesome.</p>
        <p>''She is a mystery candidate this cycle for us,'' he said, noting that of  30 representatives of political action committees and interest groups he polled, only one had met her. ''I've been doing this for 20 years, and when you get a candidate who doesn't come through and nobody has met the candidate, you start to wonder what's wrong.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson said her priorities have kept her in the district rather than in Washington. ''I've got to be here; this is where the votes are,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Israel, Mr. Rothenberg called him a good candidate -- able to raise money and talk articulately about the issues -- though he had one reservation: ''He drives you a little bit buggy in that he took credit for everything that happened in the Huntington Town Board.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Walter, of the Cook Political Report, gave a plot summary for the unfolding election drama, beginning with Mr. Israel's role: ''The question really is, can he overcome the Republican leanings of this district, will he be able to effectively cut into Johnson's base in Islip, and steal some voters from her, and will he benefit from the Right to Life and Conservative Party strength in this district?''</p>
        <p>''Both are here on the high wire,'' she said. ''Let's see who's best able to stay balanced.''</p>
