        <p>At first, Kenyon Martin seemed unfazed about having his No. 4 jersey retired at the University of Cincinnati's Shoemaker Center, as if hanging with the Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson and Jack Twyman were an everyday experience.</p>
        <p>The university retired his locker, encasing his red suede sneakers and uniform in glass, and Martin supposed, shrugging, that it was cool.</p>
        <p>He approached his homecoming with little sentimentality, focusing instead on his new team, the Nets, and the final preseason contest against the Cleveland Cavaliers. His detached attitude changed, however, when the crowd of 10,134 began roaring, jolting him into a state of aggressiveness the Nets had not yet seen.</p>
        <p>Martin not only returned to all-out adoration, he seemed to return to the player the Nets thought they were getting when they drafted him with the No. 1 pick as the consensus college player of the year.</p>
        <p>He scored 14 points and grabbed 12 rebounds for his second straight double-double since Coach Byron Scott criticized his effort Monday, ending the Nets' preseason with a 91-83 victory over Cleveland. The teams meet again in the season opener Tuesday at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>Kendall Gill finished his scorching preseason with another strong shooting night, hitting 9 of 13 shots (69 percent) and leading the team with 19 points. Johnny Newman had 16 off the bench, and the Nets (2-4) shot 54.4 percent. But this night belonged to Martin.</p>
        <p>He felt comfortable here, he said. Earlier in the day, Charlie Luken, the mayor of Cincinnati, presented Martin with the key to the city at City Hall. But Martin appeared still wearing his Nets practice shirt and sweat pants, not seeing what the big fuss was all about. Scott was wondering the same thing about him.</p>
        <p>''I liked his intensity tonight, he showed me a little bit of the Kenyon Martin I had expected to see,'' Scott said. ''I'm just trying to get the young man better and better. He took another step.''</p>
        <p>Fifteen seconds into the second quarter, Martin soared to the basket for an alley-oop dunk that sent the crowd into a frenzy.</p>
        <p>''I might have had too much adrenaline flowing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Martin confronted Cleveland's Robert Traylor after the 6-foot-8-inch, 289-pound Traylor elbowed Martin going over his back. Both were assessed a technical foul. ''They think I'm a rookie,'' Martin said. ''But I've never backed down from anyone.''</p>
        <p>Martin's Cincinnati career ended in March when he broke his right leg in the Bearcats' Conference U.S.A. tournament game.</p>
        <p>The Nets have little time for him to develop, though, since forward Keith Van Horn broke his leg in a preseason game Oct. 17 and will be out for at least another month, forcing Martin into immediate action.</p>
        <p>''We expect a lot out of him and we should expect big things because he's the No. 1 pick,'' said the team president, Rod Thorn. ''He cannot just be another guy.''</p>
        <p>He was not tonight.</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>Spurs Beat Knicks</p>
        <p>(By The New York Times), SAN ANTONIO, Oct. 27 --  A preseason that started with four consecutive victories ended with two straight losses for the Knicks, who were defeated tonight by the San Antonio Spurs, 90-79, at the Alamodome. The Knicks, who open the regular season against Philadelphia at home Tuesday, finished the preseason with a 5-3 record.</p>
        <p>Glen Rice played for the first time in nearly two weeks after missing four games with a sore left knee. He shot 4 of 9 and had 15 points in 20 minutes. Latrell Sprewell led the Knicks with 24 points.</p>
        <p>Coach Jeff Van Gundy, who is looking for ways to get Rice on the floor with Sprewell and Allan Houston (14 points), experimented with a lineup that featured Rice playing as a power forward alongside those two. Charlie Ward and Larry Johnson rounded out the five, and the lineup, which had no player taller than 6 feet 8 inches, played fairly well against a lineup that included Tim Duncan (17 points), Danny Ferry and Malik Rose.</p>
