        <p>''Who are we, anyhow?'' asks the intellectual historian John Patrick Diggins about Americans in this quirky, plucky and agitated book. One possible answer may be this: We are those who have to ask.</p>
        <p>But is there even a ''we'' to ask about? The United States may be the only nation in the world that was invented from an idea, lacking any foundation in a defined territory, a religious authority, a common culture or a single people. From the moment of its founding it was riven with conflict: agrarian vs. rural, patrician vs. plebian, Old World loyalists vs. New World iconoclasts, Indian vs. settler, German vs. French, slave vs. freeman. E pluribus unum? Barely. And in the contemporary United States, debates about multiculturalism and racism have taken divisiveness still further.</p>
        <p>''Never before in American history,'' Mr. Diggins writes, ''has there been such confusion about the meaning of America and the identity of the American people.'' So is there, in the midst of all this, any consensus, any unifying principle?</p>
        <p>Mr. Diggins, a professor of history at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, is a staunch believer that there is. He calls it ''Lockean liberalism.'' It is a vision of equality and liberty in which rights are guaranteed and opportunities offered. But this vision of liberty has a tragic face. It is tempered by John Locke's recognition that being human is never free of desires or demands. One freedom is the freedom not to be selfless, the freedom to be ambitious, the freedom to work, the freedom to own.</p>
        <p>This is a not a simple concept, and Mr. Diggins gives it his own distinctive spin. It is, he suggests, the closest the United States comes to having a central doctrine. But it does not make for a complacent populace or a comfortable consensus. Lockean liberalism is rife with tensions and ambiguities. In fact, Mr. Diggins points out, it ''thrives in a competitive environment of power, struggle, and self-assertion.''</p>
        <p>This can divide people as well as unite them. But the founders understood that such tensions were unavoidable. ''The plea for a common unity,'' Mr. Diggins writes, ''is precisely what they rejected.'' The authors of the Federalist Papers, he notes, cherished the existence of diversity because it prevented democracy from becoming tyranny. Multiplicity of views ensured no single view would become too dominant.</p>
        <p>So how does the ''we'' evolve? Here is where Lincoln comes in. Mr. Diggins argues that during the Civil War, when notions of liberty and property were being questioned and divisiveness led to bloodshed, Lincoln molded the modern American nation. In his views on slavery, in his insistence on national unity and in the majesty of his ideas, Lincoln was the founding father of a nation in which the Declaration of Independence became the sacred document.</p>
        <p>The Constitution with its checks and balances was designed to handle conflict, compromise and dissension. But the Declaration, in Lincoln's hands, became a guarantee of universal rights and liberties. For Lincoln its reference to the pursuit of happiness also meant the pursuit of property and the dedication to work. Lockean liberalism, with all its tensions, became a formative principle for the national government.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately Mr. Diggins does not systematically develop these ideas; they take shape gradually over the course of the book, interrupted again and again by his pressing sense that Lincoln's achievement is at risk. It is, he argues, precisely what has been at stake in America's culture wars, and precisely what is being undone by the work of contemporary radical historians.</p>
        <p>The National History Standards, for example, written in 1994 and used to shape high school history curriculums, ''lies somewhere between comedy and farce.'' In its preoccupations with diversity and injustice it ''minimized the importance of the Western Enlightenment and replaced political knowledge about human nature with cultural mystiques about races and racial heritages.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Diggins argues, historians who grew out of the New Left of the 1960's have also attacked the ''liberal consensus,'' questioning the importance of property, rejecting bourgeois interests in political compromise and refusing to accept that a ''consensus'' can even exist in American history, which is no more than a composite of competing narratives.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Diggins modern American history envisions a society that is defined not by a ''we'' but by its absence. There is only the clamor of competing claims. He praises efforts at reform, attempts to redress past injustices, efforts to come to terms with the ''dreadful disgrace'' of American racism. But the enterprise has gone awry. For the notion that there are no transcendent principles, the notion that each culture can create its own moral universe, the notion that politics is always local and never national: this is, in Mr. Diggins's view, precisely what the Civil War was fought over and precisely what Lincoln overturned by abolishing slavery and sacralizing the Declaration.</p>
        <p>In other words, the battle that is now taking shape over the American past is a distinctively American battle, in which the question ''Who are we?" is decisive. Mr. Diggins's book would be more effective if were more focused and detailed. But it still leaves the impression that this time so much more is at stake because the real answer to ''Who are we?'' may be nothing more nor less than this: We are a nation with a particular history. And that terrain is now as bloodied as Gettysburg.</p>
