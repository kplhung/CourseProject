        <p>Canadian authorities arrested two Vancouver-area men yesterday and charged them in the deaths of 329 passengers and crew members of an Air-India Boeing 747 that blew up over the Irish Sea in 1985, en route from Canada to London.</p>
        <p>The two, Ripudan Singh Malik, 53, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, 51, were arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, capping what the Mounties called the longest and most expensive criminal investigation in the nation's history.

        <p>Canadian authorities arrested two Vancouver-area men yesterday and charged them in the deaths of 329 passengers and crew members of an Air-India Boeing 747 that blew up over the Irish Sea in 1985, en route from Canada to London.</p>
        <p>The two, Ripudan Singh Malik, 53, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, 51, were arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, capping what the Mounties called the longest and most expensive criminal investigation in the nation's history. The downing of the jet is considered the deadliest act of sabotage in the history of aviation.</p>
        <p>In an eight-count indictment, the men were charged with using suitcases packed with explosives to bomb two Air-India jets on the same day, June 23, 1985. Air-India Flight 182 blew up in midair, killing all aboard.</p>
        <p>An hour earlier, a suitcase blew up in Narita Airport, outside Tokyo, as it was being loaded onto Air-India Flight 301, destined for Bangkok; it killed two baggage handlers.</p>
        <p>Anger against India erupted in 1984, when Indian troops occupied and destroyed Sikhdom's holy site, the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The temple had become a center for radicals seeking an independent Sikh state, an issue that polarized the Sikh diaspora around the world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malik and Mr. Bagri, who are both Sikhs, are to appear in court on Monday. Mr. Malik, who runs a school and credit union catering to the immigrant community, has long been a suspect in the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bagri, a mill worker from Kamloops, British Columbia, was described Thursday in The Province in Vancouver as a key lieutenant of Talwinder Singh Parmar, a Sikh militant leader shot to death by the Indian police in 1992.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bagri was also charged with trying to murder Tara Singh Hayer, editor of The Indo-Canadian Times, North America's largest Punjabi newspaper, in 1998. Mr. Hayer survived the attempt but three weeks later was shot to death in his wheelchair in his garage.</p>
        <p>''Although arrests have been made, this does not mark the conclusion of the police investigation,'' Constable Cate Galliford, spokeswoman for the Mounties' Air-India task force, said at news conference yesterday afternoon. She said, ''We do anticipate future arrests, but we don't know when those will take place.''</p>
        <p>Beverly Busson, the Mounties' commanding officer in Vancouver, said at the news conference, ''This has been a worldwide investigation with extremely challenging logistical problems.''</p>
        <p>Canada is home to half a million people of Indian origin, most of them Sikhs. Four Sikhs serve in Parliament, mostly from the Vancouver area, where half of the nation's Indo-Canadians live.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, a Sikh, Ujjal Dosanjh, became premier of British Columbia and Canada's first nonwhite provincial premier. Mr. Dosanjh, a moderate, paid a price for speaking out against Sikh extremism that gripped the Vancouver community after the Golden Temple raid.</p>
        <p>Four months before the Air-India bombing, Mr. Dosanjh was attacked outside his law office by a man wielding an iron rod. Mr. Dosanjh suffered a broken hand and needed 80 stitches for head wounds.</p>
        <p>In recent years radicalism has ebbed. Moderates have won control of Vancouver's largest Sikh temples, the provincial government has cut ''community development'' grants that once went to radical temples and the federal government is trying to curb Punjabi hate-radio transmissions broadcast from Washington State.</p>
        <p>As rumors of arrests circulated in Vancouver, Premier Dosanjh said charges would be a large step for Canadian justice. He said, ''I think people of British Columbia, people of Canada, would finally heave a sigh of relief.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 21, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Oct. 28 about Canada's arrest of two men charged in the deaths of 329 people on an Air-India plane that blew up in 1985 referred incorrectly to the place where the plane went down. (Similar errors appeared in four articles in 1996 and an editorial in 1985.) The plane fell into the Atlantic, about 150 miles southwest of Cork, Ireland, not into the Irish Sea between England and Ireland.</p>
