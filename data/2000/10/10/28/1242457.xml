        <p>Everything he ever needed to know about figuring out the city's drop in crime he learned from baseball. Just ask.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't be able to do percentages at all if it weren't for baseball averages,'' Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday. ''The only interest I ever had in figuring out percentages when I was 9 or 10 or 11 years old was to figure out Yogi Berra's average. It's a very educational thing.''</p>
        <p>Otherwise, the mayor continued, ''I couldn't figure out, I wouldn't have any idea, like when I do all these presentations on percentages, you know, 'Crime is down 50 percent, murder is down by 70 percent.' ''</p>
        <p>Which leads up to what is fast becoming the mayor's annual announcement that it is fine with him if students play hooky on Monday to attend the Yankees victory parade. And once again, the city's No. 1 Yankees fan -- who has frequently said that he should control the school system -- recommended that teachers use this year's parade for ''educational purposes.''</p>
        <p>As an example, the mayor said, teachers could organize class field trips to the festivities and have students write essays afterward.</p>
        <p>''You engage children's minds in different ways,'' Mr. Giuliani counseled from under his Yankees baseball cap at a news conference in City Hall. ''Some of it is through sports, some of it's through art. So use it. This is a great thing. It'll make them read more, it'll make them think more. Baseball is an enormously strategic sport. If you can get somebody involved in baseball, and they can figure out, or even start appreciating, why Joe Torre and Bobby Valentine did the things that they did during this World Series, these kids can be lawyers.''</p>
        <p>The Board of Education did not endorse the mayor's call for sanctioned truancy. ''Everyone likes baseball,'' Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said in a statement. ''The World Series was very exciting for us all. But that is no reason to skip school. Just like the rest of the city agencies, school will be open and I expect both teachers and students to attend. I particularly expect Mets fans to be there.''</p>
        <p>The chancellor signed his statement, ''Harold O. Levy, chief truant officer.''</p>
        <p>Last year, after a similar announcement by Mr. Giuliani, 64 percent of the city's public high school students showed up for class, compared with the normal 80 percent.</p>
