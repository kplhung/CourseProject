        <p>Israeli soldiers shot and killed four Palestinians as violence ignited across the West Bank and Gaza Strip after several days of relative calm.</p>
        <p>Arab groups had declared a ''day of rage,'' but it was not clear whether the expanded confrontations were intended to occur just on Friday, the Muslim Sabbath, when gatherings for noon prayers have often proved focal points for protests.</p>
        <p>In Ramallah, ambulances screamed in constant rotation as hundreds of Palestinians gathered on a hill to watch squads of young men hurl rocks at Israeli jeeps.</p>
        <p>Bombs exploded in Hebron and near Bethlehem, and protesters hurling firebombs started a fire on an armored personnel carrier in Gaza.</p>
