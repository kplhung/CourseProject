        <p>The celebration in the Yankees' clubhouse spilled over into the players' lounge, with the Champagne flowing freely as players crowded into the room in the back of the locker room.

        <p>The celebration in the Yankees' clubhouse spilled over into the players' lounge, with the Champagne flowing freely as players crowded into the room in the back of the locker room. But the joyous tone changed when the television flickered across an image of Mets Manager Bobby Valentine at his somber postgame news conference.</p>
        <p>First, a towel was thrown at the screen. Then the players began to mockingly chant ''Who let the dogs out'' at the screen, derisively screaming the song that had been used repeatedly by the Mets this season.</p>
        <p>Afterward, as the players filtered back into the locker room, the Yankees allowed themselves a bit of boasting, answering what some felt were slights uttered by the Mets in the Series. ''Turk had said some stuff about the bullpen,'' Yankee reliever Jeff Nelson said of Mets reliever Turk Wendell. ''Benny Agbayani said some things, and maybe they were taken out of context. If they'd have left their mouth shut, it would be better. It's better to just go out on the field.''</p>
