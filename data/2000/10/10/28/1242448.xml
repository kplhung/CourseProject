        <p>As the West rushed to embrace Vojislav Kostunica's recent emergence as president of Yugoslavia, Kosovo's Albanians -- suppressed for years by the Serbs until NATO intervened last year -- felt threatened once more.</p>
        <p>While the former president, Slobodan Milosevic, was in power, the Albanians were confident of support and understanding from the West -- and even sympathy for their goal of independence.</p>
        <p>But now they are suspicious about Mr. Kostunica and feel a new urgency to resolve the status of Kosovo, which is administered, for now, by the United Nations. International peacekeeping troops have been protecting the Kosovo people since Yugoslav troops withdrew in June 1999 after 78 days of NATO bombing.</p>
        <p>The Albanians' concerns remain despite the momentous change that swept through their neighbor and old enemy, Serbia, just weeks ago, bringing Mr. Kostunica in as the new president and fundamentally changing the political world around Kosovo.</p>
        <p>At first, the Albanians here ignored what was going on to the north. Since they remain officially part of Yugoslavia, they could have participated in the Yugoslav election that brought Mr. Kostunica to power. But the Albanians boycotted the election, as they have every election organized by Belgrade during the past 10 years, because, they argue, voting would legitimize a rule by Serbs they do not want.</p>
        <p>''We are not joining in with the international euphoria over the events in Belgrade, but I understand the euphoria,'' said Alush Gashi, a senior member of the largest political party, the Democratic League of Kosovo. He said Mr. Kostunica is someone the Albanians can talk to, ''and if he is someone who has not committed any crimes, that's good, but he is a man who has not distanced himself from crimes against humanity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica's rise to power has coincided with the first real elections the Albanians have known since Mr. Milosevic stripped them of autonomy in 1989. The balloting on Saturday will be for local councils, but the campaigning, which the Albanians have embraced enthusiastically, has revolved around global issues -- first and foremost, independence for Kosovo.</p>
        <p>This week, Mr. Kostunica acknowledged that crimes were committed by Yugoslav forces in Kosovo and has promised to work on freeing Albanian prisoners from Serbian jails as he tries to forge a relationship with the people of Kosovo. His pledge was welcomed by Dr. Bernard Kouchner, head of the United Nations administration in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>''If the Albanians are not saying anything, that means they see it as good,'' Dr. Kouchner told journalists this week. ''Kostunica's comments are good, and I think he will be making more. We will face difficulties, but the difficulties will have become positive.''</p>
        <p>And Richard C. Holbrooke, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said during a visit to Kosovo this week that he was confident that Mr. Kostunica would not pursue Mr. Milosevic's tactic of infiltrating the Serb police and military on covert missions to destabilize Kosovo and intimidate the beleaguered Serb communities left here.</p>
        <p>But most ordinary Albanians say they see no difference between Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Kostunica.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe he is better -- he was also a paramilitary in Kosovo,'' said Mihrije Preneqi, an electrician, as she left a political rally in Pristina, the capital. She was referring to a photograph that showed Mr. Kostunica holding an automatic rifle during a visit to Kosovo, and which has been widely published here since he won the presidency.</p>
        <p>Ms. Preneqi said she supported independence, but also some dialogue. ''If the Serbs are democratic, then we see our future as neighbors,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But speeches at the election rallies this week showed that popular feeling is still violently anti-Serb. Hashim Thaci, the former political leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which fought Serbian forces for two years, and now leader of the Democratic Party of Kosovo, draws much of his support from young activists and former fighters.</p>
        <p>''The killer Serb army under Milosevic is the same army under Kostunica,'' Mr. Thaci said. ''I want you to be sure that every act of Belgrade will be rejected and condemned, and will get the response it deserves from the Albanians and from the democratic world,'' he said, to enormous cheers.</p>
        <p>Yet, when pushed, the Albanians agree that Mr. Kostunica can only be an improvement on Mr. Milosevic, who disenfranchised them and sent his forces against them and their armed rebellion in Kosovo, culminating in the expulsion of more than a million people from their homes during the NATO bombing campaign. Hundreds of thousands were left homeless and thousands were killed.</p>
        <p>Qerim Mulaj, 30, a former guerrilla fighter, now unemployed, said he could see Albanian leaders entering into a dialogue with Mr. Kostunica in due course. ''If all the Albanian prisoners are released and the fate of the disappeared solved, then they could. It would be normal,'' he said as he left the rally.</p>
        <p>Political leaders are calling for general elections in Kosovo as soon as possible, arguing that this is the only way that they can have viable, elected leaders who can negotiate their future and deal with Serbia, rather than rely on foreigners to do it for them.</p>
        <p>''Independence is not your issue, it is not the West's issue,'' said Ramush Haradinaj, a former commander of the liberation army and now leader of an alliance of parties, the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo.</p>
        <p>''We will work inside the rules,'' he said, ''but I do not need to discuss it with anyone. The West is not the one who decides,  and it must respect the will and determination of Kosovars.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Haradinaj makes it clear he will continue the battle for independence if necessary, even if it has moved into the political arena. ''Kostunica is good because a democratic Serbia will be better prepared to accept the reality here,'' he said.</p>
