        <p>Preservationists and state officials cheered this month as International Paper agreed to sell them a large wooded property called Treetops, to be conserved as open space. But now a New York City developer that had planned to build luxury homes on the site is suing the company over the sale.</p>
        <p>In the lawsuit, filed Tuesday in State Superior Court here, the developer, Brickman Associates, said it had agreed to buy the property for $15 million and it accused International Paper of backing out of the deal.</p>
        <p>The Treetops property, a 110-acre plot that includes a 33-room house, was once owned by the torch singer and actress Libby Holman, who died in 1971.</p>
        <p>The property is in a watershed area considered rich in natural resources.</p>
        <p>Last week, International Paper announced that it had agreed to sell the site to the Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit conservation group, in a deal that also involved the state and the municipalities of Greenwich and Stamford.</p>
