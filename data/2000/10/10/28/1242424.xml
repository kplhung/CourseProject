        <p>Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson says he knows his rulings in the Microsoft antitrust case are controversial, but he has no regrets, even though, as he put it today, ''virtually everything I did may be vulnerable on appeal.''</p>
        <p>Speaking to an antitrust conference sponsored by George Mason University, Judge Jackson said a breakup of the company, which he ordered in June, ''was never my remedy of choice.''</p>
        <p>He added, however, that ''Microsoft intransigence'' left him no choice.</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson has made many of these remarks before. In fact, Microsoft recently tried to use one of his comments against him. In a appellate court brief, the company quoted him as saying his rulings were vulnerable on appeal in an effort to bolster its case.</p>
        <p>Last spring, Judge Jackson found Microsoft in wide violation of state and federal antitrust laws and ordered the company broken up. Those rulings are now on appeal.</p>
        <p>In earlier interviews, Judge Jackson acknowledged that he followed a long learning curve as he worked to understand the technological issues underlying the case. Trying to short-circuit that, the appellate court invited a technology expert to hold a computer-technology seminar for the judges next month, one that would not touch upon the issues in the trial.</p>
        <p>But both Microsoft and the government raised questions about that idea, and on Thursday the court, in a one-paragraph statement, said it would not proceed with the review session ''upon consideration of the parties' responses'' to the plan.</p>
