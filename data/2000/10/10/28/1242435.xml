        <p>Editorial notes that black plaintiffs have sued automobile finance companies for allegedly charging them more for their loans than they charge comparable white borrowers; praises Justice Department for siding with plaintiffs</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Black plaintiffs have sued automobile finance companies because, they say, the companies charged them more for their loans than they charged comparable white borrowers. The lenders reject the accusation that their loans are racially discriminatory, pointing out that they never knew the race of the borrowers. That might seem like an ironclad defense. But the Department of Justice does not think so, and it has properly weighed in on the side of the plaintiffs.</p>
        <p>In one lawsuit filed in Nashville two years ago, according to documents pried loose by The Times and ABC News, a black couple purchased a Nissan vehicle with money borrowed from the Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation. The lender never met the borrowers. Instead the dealer met with the couple and submitted an application to the lender, who set a minimum interest rate based on the couple's credit rating. The dealer then decided how much of a markup to add to that rate. The dealer and lender split the proceeds of the markup, which cost the borrowers thousands of dollars over the loan's life.</p>

        <p>Black plaintiffs have sued automobile finance companies because, they say, the companies charged them more for their loans than they charged comparable white borrowers. The lenders reject the accusation that their loans are racially discriminatory, pointing out that they never knew the race of the borrowers. That might seem like an ironclad defense. But the Department of Justice does not think so, and it has properly weighed in on the side of the plaintiffs.</p>
        <p>In one lawsuit filed in Nashville two years ago, according to documents pried loose by The Times and ABC News, a black couple purchased a Nissan vehicle with money borrowed from the Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation. The lender never met the borrowers. Instead the dealer met with the couple and submitted an application to the lender, who set a minimum interest rate based on the couple's credit rating. The dealer then decided how much of a markup to add to that rate. The dealer and lender split the proceeds of the markup, which cost the borrowers thousands of dollars over the loan's life.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs maintain that the markups are typically higher for black borrowers than for white borrowers with comparable income, wealth and credit records. That difference, the Justice Department agrees, violates the fair-lending rules even if the lending process took no intentional account of race.</p>
        <p>The dealers may not be biased. They presumably set the markups to maximize profits and are able to charge applicants who have few alternative sources of loans -- often blacks -- more than applicants who can easily borrow from banks or family. Blacks may wind up paying more even if the dealers have no discriminatory motives.</p>
        <p>The lenders say that if the dealers are responsible for discriminatory markups, sue them. But, Justice argues, the lenders control the loans and are therefore legally responsible. It also makes sense to put liability on the people who can most easily monitor and enforce the fair-lending rules, namely the large lenders. The lenders created the system. They should be compelled to fix it.</p>
