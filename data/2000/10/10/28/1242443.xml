        <p>INSIDE the Mets' clubhouse early yesterday morning, there was a library hush to the room. The Mets had just lost to the Yankees in the fifth and final game of the World Series. Players spoke in muted tones, but unlike after previous disappointments against the Atlanta Braves, there was no sense of devastation. They played great against a great team, and lost.</p>
        <p>With the Yankees outside celebrating their third consecutive World Series title, you would have expected to hear grumbling about the opposition ''celebrating on our turf,'' but there was none of that.</p>
        <p>Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said: ''It doesn't hurt more because we lost here. We don't feel insulted or like they're rubbing dirt in our faces.''</p>
        <p>The Mets succeeded where two previous National League champions had failed: they won a game and had point-blank chances to win two more if not for balls hit a centimeter too high or a centimeter too low.</p>
        <p>The Mets had played as well as they could have possibly played. They flustered the unflappable Yankees into rare misplays: Tino Martinez and Andy Pettitte on the same play, and Scott Brosius on another.</p>
        <p>In an unforgettable moment in Game 2, World Series pressure drove Roger Clemens to the point of hysteria when he threw the barrel of a splintered bat toward Mike Piazza. But there was even comic closure to that situation in the fourth inning of Game 5 on Thursday when Kurt Abbott's bat broke and Derek Jeter fielded it. With a knowing smile, Jeter politely handed the barrel to a batboy.</p>
        <p>But for a bounce here or there, the Mets  got nearly everything they wanted in this series, even down to the final at-bat in Game 5: Piazza, the potential tying run, against Mariano Rivera. Piazza got some of the pitch, not all of it, but enough to give Mets fans one last hope for glory before the ball settled into Bernie Williams's glove for the final out.</p>
        <p>As Al Leiter said after the game: ''When you have good teams and good players, good stuff happens. Lucky stuff happens.''</p>
        <p>In the span of five days, Leiter pitched two of the best games of his career. In Game 1, the Mets lost in 12 innings when closer Armando Benitez could not hold Leiter's 3-2 lead. In Leiter's mind, he pitched hard enough but not long enough (seven innings), so Thursday night he was going to pitch to doomsday, long and hard. Between innings of Game 5, Leiter had walked back and forth in the tunnel leading from the dugout to the clubhouse telling Lenny Harris: ''We're going to win, we're going to win. There's going to be a Game 6.''</p>
        <p>After the Yankees' two-run, ninth-inning rally, Leiter was distraught. ''I was upset; I'd never been so emotional in a game,'' he said. ''I know it's just a game, not life or death. Why was I so upset? I guess because I knew how well I threw, and still not being able to get through. Plus all the other stuff going on: playing for the team I rooted for as a kid, wanting to beat the Yankees. It was just very emotional.'' Leiter pitched long (eight and two-thirds innings) and hard (142 pitches).</p>
        <p>Benny Agbayani talked about the Mets' evolution: from just missing the playoffs in 1998 to reaching the National League Championship Series last season to reaching the World Series in 2000. Still, the Mets did not beat Atlanta to get there. ''People can say that, but we don't care,'' he said. ''We didn't care who we played, as long as we got here.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' shortcomings, indeed the difference between the organizations, was crystallized by one position: shortstop. The position is the Yankees' foundation and has become the Mets' Achilles' heel this season. The Mets were plagued by the absence of a quality shortstop after Rey Ordonez broke his arm early in the season. They tried the playmaking Melvin Mora at shortstop and finally traded him for Mike Bordick. But by crucial Game 5 of the World Series, Bordick was out of the lineup. The series ended with Abbott, a backup all season, at short.</p>
        <p>Before the World Series, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed a dual celebration for the Mets and the Yankees. Regardless who won, New York City was the winner. John Franco considered the invitation and finally shook his head. The Yankees won the World Series for the third consecutive time. They won convincingly. They should parade alone.</p>
        <p>''I think it'd be kind of weird,'' Franco said. ''I think that if you ask the guys in the clubhouse, they would say the same thing.''</p>
        <p>The Mets assumed a noble realism about themselves. Perhaps this is what separates Mets fans from Mets players.</p>
        <p>The players probably knew as early as Game 2 that the Yankees were the better team. The challenge was whether they could steal the series. But for a bounce here, a bounce there, they nearly did.</p>
        <p>The question now is: How much will those missed bounces cost the Mets? After Giuliani entered the Mets' clubhouse wearing a Yankees jacket, he congratulated several players and finally went over to Leiter and gave him a hug. They shook hands and Giuliani said, ''You'll be back.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees are certain they'll be back. Maybe next season. The Mets, lacking the same infrastructure and the Yankees' allure to attract star-quality free agents, can only hope. Hope is the defining condition of  the Mets fans, thus their slogan: You Gotta Believe.</p>
        <p>As one Yankees fan left Shea Stadium after it was over, he spotted a group of Mets fans holding ''Gotta Believe'' signs and told them that was the difference between them.</p>
        <p>''You believe,'' he shouted. ''We know.''</p>
