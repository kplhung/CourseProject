        <p>Following the lead of the House, the Senate today approved a $37.7 billion spending bill that President Clinton has promised to veto. But even as they defied the president with the vote, the Senate's Republican leaders called for negotiations with the White House to iron out their differences on the legislation.</p>
        <p>The senators approved the spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and State Departments and the federal courts by a vote of 49 to 42. The measure is the same bill the House passed on Thursday, provoking a threat of a veto by Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>The president has objected that the measure lacks a broad amnesty for certain illegal immigrants. In the White House's view, the measure also contains too little money to allow the government to pursue litigation against tobacco companies.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Clinton criticized the measure for not expanding federal hate-crimes protections to cover people who are attacked because of their sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>Rather than daring the president to veto the bill, Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, said he hoped Mr. Clinton would hold on to the measure while White House and Congressional negotiators tried to reach a compromise on areas of disagreement. If an agreement is reached, any corrections to the measure would be made via amendments to other spending bills.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully, he will decide not to veto it while we work out any agreements that need to be worked out,'' Mr. Lott told reporters after the measure was approved.</p>
        <p>White House officials say they have made no decisions on whether the president will veto the bill right away or hold on to it.</p>
        <p>''We have not yet received the Commerce, Justice, State bill, but generally we have not yet made decisions about the timing on bills that are up to be signed or vetoed,'' said Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
        <p>Even as the Senate was acting, White House officials met with senior Republican and Democratic lawmakers to try to reach an agreement. Ostensibly the talks were on a spending bill to finance the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Departments, but Congressional leaders and the White House expect the discussions to include a number of other outstanding issues.</p>
        <p>Both sides reported scant progress at the end of the day. But, in keeping with a somewhat conciliatory atmosphere, Mr. Clinton, in remarks to reporters, praised the attempt to cobble together an agreement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said of the labor, health and education bill, ''If you notice, even though it hasn't passed and it should have passed, I didn't say a word of criticism in my remarks about it because we're continuing to work together in a bipartisan fashion.''</p>
        <p>Republicans also hope that progress in the talks will prompt Mr. Clinton to change his mind about signing only temporary spending measures that last 24 hours. Since the fiscal year ended on Sept. 30, stopgap measures are required to give the federal government authority to continue to spend money.</p>
        <p>If those governmental agencies without approved spending bills are to keep functioning, Congress must remain in session over the weekend, passing temporary stopgap spending bills, known as continuing resolutions, on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
        <p>The White House hopes that forcing the lawmakers to remain in Washington over the weekend will generate pressure from rank-and-file members, especially those in tight re-election fights, on their leaders to complete work on the outstanding spending bill.</p>
        <p>But Republican leaders scheduled votes on the temporary bills for Saturday morning and for Sunday evening to give the lawmakers the maximum amount of time to campaign.</p>
        <p>But while work was being done on the outstanding spending measures, prospects for enactment of a $240 billion tax package that had been bundled with an estimated $30 billion package of Medicare payments to health care providers seemed to be receding.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott put off a vote on the measure until next week in the face of a threatened filibuster by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who objected to a provision that blocks further implementation of an Oregon law that allows physicians to assist terminally ill patients who seek to commit suicide.</p>
        <p>And with time running out in this legislative session, Mr. Clinton has threatened to veto the tax measure, saying that too many of its provisions benefit the wealthy. ''The tax bill is gone,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>The majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, said of the Democratic minority leader, ''Dick Gephardt is more concerned about his own personal political fortunes than he is about passing legislation that would help real Americans struggling with real problems.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gephardt called his comments ''absolute, unadulterated nonsense.''</p>
