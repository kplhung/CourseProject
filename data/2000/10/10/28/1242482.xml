        <p>Twelve hours after the end of the World Series, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine sat comfortably in a seat that had once seemed so hot. Valentine, wearing khakis and a Mets golf shirt, sat in his office at Shea Stadium and spoke with ease and candor about the World Series and his uncertain future.</p>
        <p>There is a chance that Valentine managed his last game for the Mets on Thursday, when they lost to the Yankees, 4-2, in the fifth and final game of the World Series. Valentine's contract expires on Tuesday, but he is in a strong negotiating position. It seems inevitable that he will land a lucrative deal somewhere.</p>
        <p>''Change is the thing people dislike most in life,'' Valentine said. ''I'm no different. Yet, on the same token, I enjoy and embrace challenges. Whether I stay or not -- and I have no reason to believe I'm not going to -- I know there's going to be plenty of challenges in front.''</p>
        <p>General Manager Steve Phillips must sign his own deal before he can begin negotiating with Valentine. ''We're hoping that both deals can be done by the 31st,'' Phillips said.</p>
        <p>Phillips said he and the Mets' owners have had ''conceptual discussions about the structure of a deal,'' but that nothing will be announced on his contract until Monday at the earliest. That would leave little time to work out a deal with Valentine before Wednesday, when Valentine would become a free agent.</p>
        <p>Phillips will not grant other teams permission to speak with Valentine until Wednesday; the Cincinnati Reds have been denied permission, and Valentine hinted yesterday that another team may have also inquired. Valentine's first choice is to stay with the Mets, and he said he could ''absolutely'' re-sign with them before exploring his value on the open market.</p>
        <p>But that would depend on the Mets' offer, Valentine said.</p>
        <p>''My timetable was last year at this time,'' he said. Valentine wanted to make a deal then but was told by one of the Mets' two owners, Fred Wilpon, to wait until this year. That was a business decision, Valentine said yesterday, and it would ''obviously'' take more to sign him now than it would have a year ago.</p>
        <p>''We decided to wait to the end of the year to see what I was worth, right?'' he said. ''And if we came in last, it would have been determined that I wasn't worth very much.''</p>
        <p>Instead, the Mets won 94 games and the National League pennant. In the division series, Valentine outmanaged the Giants' Dusty Baker, who recently signed a two-year contract with an average annual value of nearly $2.75 million.</p>
        <p>Seattle's Lou Piniella was offered a three-year deal on Thursday, reportedly for $7 million. The Yankees' Joe Torre is baseball's highest-paid manager, at $3 million a year; other managers, including Don Baylor of the Cubs and Phil Garner of the Tigers, have four-year contracts that pay them more than $1 million a year. Valentine earned less than that on his expiring three-year deal.</p>
        <p>Managing in New York has a significant downside, Valentine said, adding that he was not sure if there was an added benefit that went along with the burden.</p>
        <p>''Managing in this city for our team, the situation that we're in, all things considered -- the Yankees, et al. -- is, I think, the most difficult situation in America,'' he said. ''Now I haven't been in everybody else's shoes, but I've imagined what it's like to be across the field or in another city. I'm not a glutton for punishment.''</p>
        <p>But if Valentine seemed to suggest that he is ready to leave, he went on to outline several reasons why he wants to stay with the Mets -- from the proximity to his family to his desire to buy a home in Fairfield County, Conn., where he is from.</p>
        <p>''I'm 50 years old,'' he said. ''I'm very tired of renting an apartment and not having my dogs and my family with me all year. I can guarantee you that -- very tired.''</p>
        <p>Valentine said many players came into his office after Game 5 and asked him to stay, a gesture that he said meant a lot. Valentine also pointed out that he has worn a Mets uniform for parts of four decades.</p>
        <p>''There's no other affection, affinity, attraction or connection that can come close to what I have here with the Mets,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another close connection Valentine has is with Tommy Lasorda, his friend and mentor and the senior vice president of the Los Angeles Dodgers, one of five teams with a managerial opening.</p>
        <p>Lasorda spoke with Valentine yesterday morning, reminding Valentine that he had lost his first two World Series as a manager and had learned much from losing. Valentine was asked yesterday what he expects to learn from this World Series.</p>
        <p>With the wounds from the Series still fresh, Valentine conceded several mistakes he made that he would not repeat.</p>
        <p>''You just can't take things for granted,'' he said. ''Because it's late in the season or guys have gotten to this point, you still have to pay major attention to detail. There were some things that were touched on and they were emphasized, but they could have been overemphasized. They could have been beaten to a drum, and I would have felt better about it.''</p>
        <p>Specifically, Valentine said, he was disappointed in himself for not reiterating before Game 5 that Andy Pettitte, the Yankees starter, would use his outstanding pickoff move when he gets in trouble. With runners on first and second and one out in the fourth inning, Pettitte picked off Kurt Abbott when first baseman Tino Martinez -- playing off the bag -- sneaked in from behind.</p>
        <p>Valentine said the first-base coach, Mookie Wilson, reminded Abbott, but Abbott was trying to be aggressive on the bases and thinking of breaking up a possible double play. Valentine said he should have been yelling from the dugout to reinforce the possibility of Pettitte's move.</p>
        <p>Valentine also blamed himself for not calling the rookie Timo Perez into his office after he noticed Perez's failure to run hard in a playoff game before the World Series even started. In Game 1 of the Series at Yankee Stadium, Perez was thrown out at home after failing to run hard on a two-out double off the wall by Todd Zeile.</p>
        <p>''I should have seized that opportunity, in the playoff situation, to call him in the next day and tell him about showing his speed off every time he was running,'' Valentine said. ''And if he did that, I think he would have run harder when that ball hit off the fence.''</p>
        <p>Still, Valentine said, he is at peace with the way things went.</p>
        <p>''It's over, and it was one of the greatest experiences of my life,'' he said. ''I'm glad I got to share it with a great team, and I'm sorry that we fell short of our final goal.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>MARK RODGERS, the agent for the Mets left-hander MIKE HAMPTON, said Hampton will not file for free agency until Rodgers speaks with Mets General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS, which he hopes to do early next week. Rodgers said Hampton could re-sign with the Mets before he files, though the Mets would have to make ''significant progress'' from their position of last winter.</p>
