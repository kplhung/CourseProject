        <p>Last season the soprano Jane Eaglen was a major presence at the Metropolitan Opera, singing in the new production of Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' and the revival of Wagner's ''Ring,'' and doing her best work in New York to date. This season Ms. Eaglen appears only in the title role of Puccini's ''Turandot,'' a run of nine performances that began on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>Ms. Eaglen regularly sings this demanding role: Puccini's famously steely princess in ancient Beijing who nurtures an obsessive hatred of men. But it does not ideally suit her. She has the requisite power: a dramatic soprano that can soar over Puccini's brassy orchestration and the amassed chorus during the pivotal scene at the imperial palace. In sustained passages she is often impressive, especially in the middle and upper-middle range where her sound is at its best: warm, vibrant and ample without being forced.</p>

        <p>Last season the soprano Jane Eaglen was a major presence at the Metropolitan Opera, singing in the new production of Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' and the revival of Wagner's ''Ring,'' and doing her best work in New York to date. This season Ms. Eaglen appears only in the title role of Puccini's ''Turandot,'' a run of nine performances that began on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>Ms. Eaglen regularly sings this demanding role: Puccini's famously steely princess in ancient Beijing who nurtures an obsessive hatred of men. But it does not ideally suit her. She has the requisite power: a dramatic soprano that can soar over Puccini's brassy orchestration and the amassed chorus during the pivotal scene at the imperial palace. In sustained passages she is often impressive, especially in the middle and upper-middle range where her sound is at its best: warm, vibrant and ample without being forced.</p>
        <p>But she lacks the temperament and volatility to make this character credible. Turandot's icy resolve is melted not just by the determined ardor of her princely suitor, Calaf, but also by the example of sacrificial love offered by the devoted slave, Liu. We must witness her transformation and hear it in her voice. On Tuesday, Ms. Eaglen was always herself: a famous soprano come to the Met to sing a role that few others can, and that will have to do.</p>
        <p>Even vocally her work was sometimes sluggish. The Wagner roles she sings do not demand as much of Ms. Eaglen's top range, the one weak area of her voice; but Turandot does. There were a couple of times when Ms. Eaglen's climactic highs wobbled unnervingly.</p>
        <p>The most enthusiastic, and deserving, ovation of the night went to the soprano Angela Gheorghiu, who sang Liu for the first time this season. Dramatically, Ms. Gheorghiu's dark-haired, diminutive beauty makes her an ideal Liu. And vocally the dusky, plaintive timbre of her sound and her supple phrasing convey both Liu's suffering and nobility of character. Though her voice is not essentially large, she focuses and supports her sound so ably that she easily fills the house.</p>
        <p>The vibrant-voiced tenor Richard Margison remains the production's Calaf. The bass Robert Lloyd was a stentorian and sympathetic Timur, the vanquished king, and Calaf's long-lost father. This is the second time I have heard Marco Armiliato conduct ''Turandot'' this season and both performances were perplexingly shaky. He has done good work with the Met orchestra in the past, but on these two nights the playing was rough and poorly balanced.</p>
