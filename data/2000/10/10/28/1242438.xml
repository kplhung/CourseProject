        <p>Israeli soldiers shot four Palestinians dead today as violence flared across the West Bank and Gaza Strip after several days of relative calm.</p>
        <p>In Ramallah, ambulances screamed in constant rotation as hundreds of Palestinians gathered on a hill to watch squads of young men hurl rocks at Israeli jeeps parked across from their barrier of burned-out cars.</p>
        <p>Smoking tear-gas canisters arced through the air from the Israeli side, and at intervals there were bursts of automatic weapons fire from what appeared to be a position in an unfinished building on the Palestinian side.</p>
        <p>Roadside bombs exploded in Hebron and near Bethlehem on the West Bank, and protesters hurling firebombs set an Israeli armored personnel carrier on fire near the Karni checkpoint in Gaza. Shots were fired tonight from Palestinian areas near Gilo, a settlement in Jerusalem, and Psagot, a settlement near here. The shots were answered by machine gun fire from Israeli tanks.</p>
        <p>Helicopters fired rockets tonight at Beit Jala, across a valley from Gilo.</p>
        <p>Today had been declared a ''day of rage'' by various Arab organizations. But it was not clear whether the expanded confrontations were intended to occur just on Fridays, the Muslim Sabbath, when gatherings for noon prayers have often proved to be focal points for protests.</p>
        <p>Still, four deaths today mean four funerals on Saturday. And in the cycle of martyrdom among the demonstrators, the emotional processions have often ended with marches to confront Israeli soldiers, and often new deaths.</p>
        <p>The casualties today bring the death toll in a month of protests to at least 137, all but eight Arabs.</p>
        <p>A 27-year-old was shot in the heart at what has become a traditional confrontation point in this West Bank city. He was dead on arrival at the hospital, officials there said.</p>
        <p>One man was killed in a clash in Tulkarm and another in Qalqilya. A man in Jenin was brain dead from his wound, said the deputy health minister of the Palestinian Authority, Dr. Munzer Sharif, who was compiling reports in an office in Ramallah Hospital.</p>
        <p>In Gaza, a 23-year-old was shot dead in a clash near the Erez checkpoint that separates the Palestinian-run area from Israel, said Dr. Muawiyah Hasanein, director of the emergency room at Shifa Hospital.</p>
        <p>Palestinian hospital officials said 142 people were treated for wounds, with 12 in critical condition.</p>
        <p>In Gaza, Nabil al-Arair, who killed himself on Thursday when he set off explosives that he was carrying in a backpack after pedaling his bicycle near an army post close to an Israeli settlement, was hailed as a martyr at his funeral and left behind an eerie message from the grave.</p>
        <p>''Thank God I am headed where I have always wanted to go,'' he said in a suicide note read at the funeral. ''I urge you to continue the intifada until the liberation of Jerusalem. I urge you to keep up the jihad and resistance.''</p>
        <p>For the first time, a suicide bomber's funeral was broadcast live on the official Palestinian television station. The film can presumably be picked up and carried on the satellite stations that are widely watched here and around the Arab world.</p>
        <p>''Barak, prepare the coffins,'' the mourners chanted, in reference to Prime Minister Ehud Barak.</p>
        <p>The Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing. The group, a Muslim fundamentalist organization, and the larger Hamas have promised additional bombings.</p>
        <p>A Hamas leader, Ismail Abu Shanab, said: ''We say to Barak: 'We are coming. We have accepted the challenge.' We are coming to Tel Aviv. We are coming to every place in Palestine to purify it from Jews.''</p>
        <p>There were grim assessments from the Israeli Army that the clashes would continue unabated for months.</p>
        <p>''We estimate the Palestinians will continue with the waves of violence and shooting incidents, and I estimate there will also be attacks,'' Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz told Army Radio.</p>
        <p>The chief spokesman for the army, Brig. Gen. Ron Kitrey, said the army's ''basic assumption'' was that ''the year 2001 will be a year of unrest, a year that we have to plan out operations to face the situation of a continuing dispute.''</p>
        <p>''We do hope we will be found wrong,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, who lost his parliamentary majority in July, is trying to forge an emergency coalition government between his Labor Party and the right-wing Likud Party.</p>
        <p>Israel Radio said Mr. Barak and Ariel Sharon of Likud met at Mr. Barak's home late Thursday and might meet again as soon as Saturday night.</p>
