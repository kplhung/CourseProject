        <p>Allied Domecq P.L.C. has secured the rights to the Captain Morgan rum brand, which is part of the Seagram wine and beverage business that is up for auction. Seagram is selling the unit, valued at about $7 billion, as part of its planned merger with Vivendi of France. Allied Domecq secured the rights through an alliance with with Destileria Serralles, a Puerto Rican rum supplier that has the right of first refusal should the Captain Morgan brand change hands. Likewise, Vin &amp; Sprit of Sweden is expected to exercise similar authority over its Absolut vodka brand, which is also part of the Seagram portfolio. Vin &amp; Sprit is bidding for the entire drinks division jointly with Bacardi and Brown-Forman, although that agreement does not include the rights to Absolut. Diageo P.L.C. has also submitted a bid jointly with Pernod Ricard S.A.</p>
