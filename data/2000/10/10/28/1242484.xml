        <p>A small army of family members waited outside the visitors' clubhouse at Shea Stadium just past 1 a.m. yesterday.

        <p>A small army of family members waited outside the visitors' clubhouse at Shea Stadium just past 1 a.m. yesterday. Inside, a handful of Yankees showered off the acrid scent of dried Champagne, dirt and sweat, dressing quickly to join the championship celebrations across the city. Rushing out were Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada and Mariano Rivera.</p>
        <p>But Mike Stanton lingered, a procrastinator by nature. Jeff Nelson loitered by his locker, one of several core members of the Yankees' dynasty who might not return next year and could be replaced by a new generation of players -- additions that might include the Cleveland slugger Manny Ramirez.</p>
        <p>Infielder Luis Sojo lounged in the lasting glory of the moment. It was his single off the Mets' Al Leiter that broke the 2-2 tie with two out in the top of the ninth, giving the Yankees a 4-2 victory and their 26th championship. ''I know you guys didn't expect me to be here,'' Sojo told reporters, ''but I mean, it's very special.''</p>
        <p>Sojo started at second base in the first 11 games of the playoffs, but he did not start Game 1 of the World Series, or Game 5, because Jose Vizcaino had better career numbers against Leiter. A former teammate of Leiter's in Toronto, Sojo had two hits in eight at-bats versus Leiter, and he had always been in awe of Leiter's raw stuff, the hard cut fastball that thuds against the bat like a shot-put. ''He's got that heavy ball,'' Sojo said.</p>
        <p>But Chuck Knoblauch pinch-hit for Vizcaino in the top of the eighth inning, and in the bottom of the eighth, Sojo went into the game as the second baseman. Double-switched into the game with Stanton, Sojo was batting ninth in the lineup.</p>
        <p>Leiter retired the first two batters in the top of the ninth, but he walked Posada with two out, the pitch count reaching 138, his highest of the year. The Yankees had two right-handers due to hit, Scott Brosius and Sojo, but Mets Manager Bobby Valentine was leery of the left-handed-hitting Luis Polonia coming off the bench as a pinch-hitter. So, with the left-hander John Franco warming up, he stayed with Leiter.</p>
        <p>Brosius singled to left. First and second and two out. Mike Piazza, the Mets' catcher, went to the mound as Sojo prepared to hit. ''I saw them talking and I knew they were going to throw me a strike,'' Sojo recalled.</p>
        <p>Leiter threw his 142nd pitch: a slider, he said later. Sojo, who went to the plate looking for that nasty Leiter stuff, never saw it. ''It was like a B.P. fastball,'' Sojo said. ''It was just like batting practice, and I hit it up the middle.''</p>
        <p>The ball was rolling slowly in short center, the Yankees' first hit with a runner in scoring position in 26 innings, and Sojo thought Posada would score easily. Posada had glanced over his left shoulder as he rounded third and saw the Mets' Jay Payton charging and throwing. ''I was thinking I better hurry up,'' Posada said.</p>
        <p>Piazza was positioned just to the left of home plate, entrenched, trying to block Posada. The throw was to his right in front of the plate, but Piazza was leery of reaching for the ball and, as he told his manager, ''leaving the back door open.''</p>
        <p>Posada said: ''He left the front door open.''</p>
        <p>Posada veered to avoid Piazza and ran into Payton's throw, the ball bouncing off him and rolling into the Mets' dugout. Brosius was waved home, and Sojo clapped and shouted in the signature moment of a long career.</p>
        <p>Rivera and Jeter mentioned gleefully, with their championship in hand, how the Yankees had been portrayed as an aging team. The fact is, they are an aging team, and there were signs of it in 2000, the list of nagging injuries growing. The right-hander David Cone, 37, struggled and went 4-14, and although he pitched better than his record indicated, it is expected he will pitch elsewhere next season. The contract for Paul O'Neill, also 37, has expired and he wants to come back. But the Yankees figure to explore other options, most notably Ramirez, a 28-year-old star who was born in the Dominican Republic and grew up in Washington Heights.</p>
        <p>Ramirez, who filed for free agency yesterday, will be expensive. The Yankees won this year with a $112 million payroll, and while George Steinbrenner, the principal owner, has tried to avoid establishing salary benchmarks, he has never allowed that sort of modesty to prevent the front office from improving the team. When their local television deal is settled, the Yankees will come into millions of dollars in additional revenue to fund their payroll.</p>
        <p>Ramirez has already rejected a five-year, $75 million offer from the Indians, and Cleveland officials are pessimistic about their chances of re-signing him. They suspect the Yankees will sign Ramirez, who is among the best right-handed hitters in the game; he batted .351 with 38 homers and 122 runs batted in this season. Ramirez's defense is poor and he has somewhat of an enigmatic personality, but that won't deter the Yankees; two years ago, they reached an oral agreement to sign the notorious outfielder Albert Belle before Belle changed his mind and decided to play for the Baltimore Orioles.</p>
        <p>Tino Martinez hit poorly during the regular season -- the Yankees' production at first base was among the worst in baseball -- but helped his chances to stay with the team by hitting well in the postseason, batting .364. He has one year left on his contract, at $6 million.</p>
        <p>Nelson can be a free agent and asked the Yankees for a four-year, $16 million deal, which is very high for a setup man.  But with few quality relievers available and Nelson a proven postseason asset, a compromise could be reached. The Yankees wanted to sign Denny Neagle after they acquired him in July, but he has asked for a multiyear deal worth $40 million or more and the Yankees won't give it to him following his late-season slump. Given Manager Joe Torre's apparent lack of faith in him during the playoffs, Neagle might prefer to go elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are expected to exercise the $1.5 million option on the slugger Glenallen Hill but probably will not retain Jose Canseco or Polonia. They will probably try to sign Sojo, Vizcaino and Dwight Gooden to minor league deals for next season.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are also expected to bid on Baltimore's All-Star pitcher, Mike Mussina, who is seeking a contract comparable, in annual salary, to the seven-year, $105 million deal signed by Kevin Brown in December 1998. Mussina filed for free agency yesterday. Unlike Ramirez, Mussina grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania and might be more comfortable playing in a smaller city, with Cleveland a possible destination.</p>
        <p>The Yankees will make inquiries into the possibility of signing the superstar shortstop Alex Rodriguez of Seattle, knowing there is virtually no chance of pulling off a deal because either Rodriguez or his close friend Jeter would have to agree to change positions.</p>
        <p>Jeter and Rivera are eligible for free agency after next season, and the Yankees will probably resume negotiations on a long-term deal with Jeter. They will have a harder time with Rivera, whose agent has a contentious relationship with club officials.</p>
        <p>There is no sense among the players that the dynasty has ended with Thursday's victory. Only two teams have won at least four straight titles: the Yankees of 1936-39 and the Yankees of 1949-53. Jeter is 26, Andy Pettitte 28, Posada 29, and as Roger Clemens said last week, one of the great things about playing for the Yankees is knowing that Steinbrenner will do whatever it takes to win. And win. And win. Every year.</p>
