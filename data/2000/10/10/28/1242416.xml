        <p>The Sanyo Electric Company, one of Japan's largest home electronics companies, said today that it was providing replacement parts for 180,000 refrigerators because the doors might fall off.</p>
        <p>In its second announcement of a defective product in a week, Sanyo said it had received complaints from 104 people about the refrigerators, which were made between 1995 and 1996. All of the refrigerators were sold in Japan.</p>
        <p>The company said the problem will cost 1 billion yen ($9.2 million).</p>
        <p>The announcement came one week after Sanyo's president, Sadao Kondo, offered to resign to take responsibility for selling defective solar power generators. Sanyo said today that Yukinori Kuwano, head of the company's semiconductor business, would replace Mr. Kondo.  There has been an expanding list of corporate missteps here relating to issues of quality control.</p>
        <p>In August, Mitsubishi Motors acknowledged that it had concealed customer complaints about its faulty cars for over two decades, and the Bridgestone/Firestone unit of the  tire maker Bridgestone announced a recall of 6.5 million tires.</p>
        <p>In September, Mitsubishi Electric said it would recall 45,000 TV's.</p>
        <p>Analysts said he real problem may not be quality but the tendency in Japan Inc. to hide problems. Sanyo said it began receiving complaints  several years ago but did not say why it only now decided to replace them.</p>
        <p>''Maybe it was because of the solar panel thing,'' said Masato Nakamura, who leads a group of lawyers involved in product liability issues. ''They may have wanted to clear this issue up before getting bashed again. Otherwise the new president might have to resign in three days.''</p>
        <p>Separately, Sanyo said it earned 53.90 billion yen ($497 million) in the April-September period after a loss of 48.46 billion yen ($447.5 million) in the similar period last year. It cited strong demand for semiconductors, personal computer equipment, mobile phones and liquid crystal products.</p>
        <p>Sales climbed 7.8 percent, to 2.83 trillion yen ($26 billion) from 2.62 trillion yen ($24.19 billion) a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Sanyo's stock fell 16 yen (15 cents), or 1.9 percent, to 850 yen ($7.85).</p>
