        <p>BEFORE baseball finally loosens its fierce grip on the autumnal city, please indulge one more image from that sport. Think of Representative Rick A. Lazio as the Babe Dahlgren of New York politics.</p>
        <p>Dahlgren, who died four years ago at age 84, went through life as a footnote to baseball history. His claim to minor fame was that in May 1939 he was told by the Yankees' manager to take over at first base for the once indestructible, now suddenly dying, Lou Gehrig.</p>
        <p>Oh, Dahlgren managed to kick around the major leagues for several more years. His career was considered reasonably respectable. But he never dazzled, and, in the end, he was known less for who he was than for whom he replaced.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has basically the same problem as his Senate race against Hillary Rod ham Clinton heads into the home stretch.</p>
        <p>Ever since he bounded off the Republican bench last May to take over from the ailing Rudolph W. Giuliani, he has labored to persuade voters that he is, if you will, a heavy hitter. Not that the mayor is necessarily Lou Gehrig. But his withdrawal from the race has left intriguing questions about the might-have-beens had he stayed in. And like Dahlgren, Mr. Lazio has struggled to get free of his predecessor's long shadow.</p>
        <p>It has not been easy, in part because he has a way of coming across like an eager undergraduate running for student government, all wide-eyed earnestness and eager-to-please smile. When he tries to show he has real substance, he sometimes stumbles.</p>
        <p>That happened on Thursday when, in a speech on foreign policy, he referred to the leader of North Korea as ''Kim Jong the Second.'' Apparently, he misread his own text and thought that Kim Jong Il was Kim Jong II.</p>
        <p>Is this slip a hanging offense? Of course not. But it was telling. Mr. Kim had been major news all week because of his landmark meeting in Pyongyang with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. Not recognizing his name, this week of all weeks, suggested a candidate with a Cliffs Notes knowledge of diplomacy.</p>
        <p>Then yesterday, in their third and final debate, Mr. Lazio took Mrs. Clinton to task once again on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. (This issue has been so dominant, with elbows flying as each candidate tries to outdo the other as Israel's champion, that the loser may want to consider a new career at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the lobbying group better known as Aipac.)</p>
        <p>The latest condemnation of Israel by the United Nations Security Council was ''an abomination,'' the congressman said, and the Clinton administration should have vetoed it. Seeking to cast his opponent as faint-hearted on this matter, he added:</p>
        <p>''It didn't take me a day to put my finger up in the wind and decide which way public opinion was going. It took me only a couple of hours to issue a statement.''</p>
        <p>Now there's a campaign slogan to do a candidate proud: Vote for Lazio. He needs only a few hours to test which way the wind is blowing.</p>
        <p>One problem for the congressman is that he has set quite a high standard for himself. Last month, he suggested that nothing less than the country's future may hang on whether he wins or loses. ''It's a race that could determine the heart and soul of America,'' he said in Watertown, N.Y. ''And for a lot of New Yorkers, I think it's a race over the heart and soul of New York. So there's a lot at stake.''</p>
        <p>F IGHTING for America's heart and soul is a lot to ask even of a Lou Geh rig. For Babe Dahlgren, the assignment is formidable. That may be why Mr. Lazio seemed flummoxed in yesterday's debate when Mrs. Clinton tried to suggest that perhaps he is too callow to be a senator from New York.</p>
        <p>The moderator, Gabe Pressman of WNBC-TV, asked the candidates if they disliked each other. Of course not, they said. Well, came the next question, what is there to like?</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, the first lady replied, has a nice family, he works hard and he is ''an attractive young man.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Lazio's part, even as he praised Mrs. Clinton for also being attractive, for having a nice family and for seeming to be a good mother, he wanted no one to go away thinking he is just another pretty face. ''I think it's much more important that Mrs. Clinton respect me as a public servant,'' he said after the debate. ''I don't really care whether she thinks I'm good looking or not.''</p>
        <p>He may have missed the point. It is entirely possible that the word Mrs. Clinton hoped voters would remember is not ''attractive'' but ''young.''</p>
