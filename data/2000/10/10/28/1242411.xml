        <p>Bruce Springsteen is a community college dropout. His songs have barely touched on higher education since his first album, in 1973, when he sang ''some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer.'' Yet he now has a campus presence that many a Ph.D. would envy.</p>
        <p>He turns up on syllabuses for courses in history, American studies, literature and business ethics. His lyrics have been scrutinized for their symbolism, political underpinnings and narrative technique.</p>
        <p>Journal articles have tabulated Mr. Springsteen's interactions with an audience, searched for recurring themes and strategies in his rhetoric and examined the way he has quietly refused to rule out the homoerotic in his videos, onstage camaraderie and lyrics, which are full of androgynous names like Terry, Frankie and Bobby Jean.</p>
        <p>All is not praise; Mr. Springsteen has been also been criticized for sidestepping the topic of race (until his new song about the Amadou Diallo shooting, ''American Skin,'' stirred up its own controversy) and for objectifying women. Lawrence Grossberg, professor of communications and cultural studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has called him a symbol of ''sentimental inauthenticity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Springsteen is by no means the first hit-maker to get the academic treatment. Scholars have long studied the mechanisms and reception of popular culture: not just music but television, movies, pulp fiction, comics, fashion and advertising as well. Professors say that Mr. Springsteen has made his way into the curriculum partly because of simple demographics. Among his millions of fans from the 1970's and 80's are people who earned graduate degrees and teaching jobs and who now dictate reading lists.</p>
        <p>Scholarly discussions have compared Mr. Springsteen not just to obvious musical forebears like Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie, but to Walt Whitman, John Wayne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Abraham Lincoln and Mark Twain, too. Jim Cullen's ''Born in the U.S.A.: Bruce Springsteen and the American Tradition'' (HarperCollins, 1997) cites those figures and praises Mr. Springsteen as an artist who has revitalized American identity by reaching back for its highest ideals. ''I see him as an inheritor of the best of who we have been,'' said Mr. Cullen, a visiting assistant professor of American civilization at Brown University and preceptor at Harvard University.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Cullen said: ''There's only so far the academy is willing to go with this stuff. It's O.K. to do popular culture, but you have to do it with academic rigor and in intellectually sanctioned ways. I don't think anyone's gotten tenure off Bruce Springsteen.''</p>
        <p>Robert Santelli, deputy director for public programs at the Experience Music Project rock museum in Seattle, is working on a book called ''Teardrops on the City,'' about Mr. Springsteen and the Asbury Park music scene in which he got started.</p>
        <p>''Bruce has self-educated himself rather deeply in American literature, American history and American culture,'' Mr. Santelli said. ''In his study, his bookshelf is what an American studies professor or grad student would be reading. And it shows in his songs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Springsteen has written about rock guitarists, Vietnam veterans, steelworkers, estranged lovers, undocumented immigrants, AIDS patients, policemen, gunmen and boardwalk fortunetellers. ''His music covers a lot of different types of ground,'' said Daniel Cavicchi, who wrote ''Tramps Like Us: Music and Meaning Among Springsteen Fans'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), an anthropological study that explored the way the songs create a community of fans.</p>
        <p>''There's sociology in 'The Ghost of Tom Joad' and his songs about immigration,'' said Mr. Cavicchi, an adjunct professor of American history and culture at the Rhode Island School of Design. ''Historians look into his sense of history and the role of American icons. Psychologists are interested in the way he deals with emotional and personal issues. And the publication of his songbook really legitimized him among academics as a poet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Springsteen's dedication to working-class lives has also made him popular with scholars. ''As race and gender and sexuality have become the dominant modes of understanding our world, class has fallen out of the picture,'' said Jefferson Cowie, a visiting assistant professor at Cornell University who specializes in labor and working-class history. ''There is nowhere else to turn in popular culture for such an explicit and provocative analysis of blue-collar life.''</p>
        <p>''The Moral Passion of Bruce Springsteen'' (International Scholars Publications, 1996), a monograph by the Rev. Pat Primeaux, associate professor of theology and religious studies at St. John's University in Queens, treats Mr. Springsteen's career as an ever broader search for meaning. Mr. Springsteen begins with girls, cars and guitars; moves to an identification with other people; and most recently, said Father Primeaux, reaches a kind of spirituality: ''a sense that he belongs to the whole of experience, and he is part of a much bigger whole.''</p>
        <p>Father Primeaux uses Mr. Springsteen as an example in his business ethics class. ''I would interpret these three phases in terms of opportunities,'' he said. ''Pursuing one opportunity he loses another, until he decides he wants them all. Ethics becomes a matter of which opportunity to pursue.''</p>
        <p>Other Springsteen scholars see different progressions in his work, with many citing 1984, his commercial peak with the album ''Born in the U.S.A.,'' as a decisive turning point. The title song, despite its triumphal chorus, portrays a Vietnam veteran whose life was shattered by the war. After President Ronald Reagan's re-election campaign tried to enlist the song as a patriotic anthem, Mr. Springsteen turned inward, writing about marriage, and looked to the tradition of Woody Guthrie for the sparse songs about have-nots on ''The Ghost of Tom Joad'' in 1995. ''Born in the U.S.A.'' has become a primary source in many classroom discussions about Vietnam, the Reagan era and the difference between intended meaning and what an audience hears.</p>
        <p>The epicenter of Springsteen studies is his home state, New Jersey, where he has loomed in classroom discussions since the 1970's. Martha Nell Smith, a professor of English at the University of Maryland, said she used Springsteen's ''Thunder Road'' to teach composition students about selective detail when she was a Rutgers graduate student in 1978.</p>
        <p>Now, she said: ''I'm an Emily Dickinson scholar, so it's not a surprise that I love Bruce Springsteen because they're both so spare in their poetry. They're deceptively simple. Too often we see things set out in black or white, good or bad. But he's not someone who gives easy answers.''</p>
        <p>Michael Aaron Rockland, chairman of the American studies department at Rutgers, draws on Springsteen in a course called ''Jerseyana'' and credits him with helping to restore the state's self-esteem. ''Here's a guy who comes along and tells it as it is about New Jersey with no apologies, and yet he celebrates the way it is,'' Mr. Rockland said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rockland and others said that taking Springsteen into the classroom did not seem trendy to students in the hip-hop generation. ''From the point of view of today's students, it's like you're into Frank Sinatra,'' Mr. Rockland said. ''And when we study somebody on campus, it's the kiss of death. In effect you're an older guy telling young people, 'This is culture, you should pay attention to it.' But Springsteen's respectability hasn't killed him off because he continues to grow, to do new things.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Springsteen, through his publicist, had no comment on his academic ascendance. But he has not stood in its way.</p>
        <p>H. Bruce Franklin, a professor of English and American studies at Rutgers University, starts his course on the literature of the Vietnam War by discussing ''Born in the U.S.A.'' When he was assembling a 1996 anthology, ''The Vietnam War in American Stories, Songs and Poems'' (Bedford Books/ St. Martin's Press), he wanted to include it but doubted that he could afford the rights to reprint such a popular song. Figuring he had nothing to lose, he got in touch with Mr. Springsteen's office.</p>
        <p>''I faxed to him on my way to class,'' Mr. Franklin said. ''And I come back from class and there's a fax back saying: 'Feel free to use it. And if you want to, make a $100 contribution to a veterans' organization.' ''</p>
