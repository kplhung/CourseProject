        <p>Garth Fagan likes to build works out of scraps of movement, which he combines as it suits his fancy. This choreographic disjointedness can sometimes be refreshing, for the dances are unpredictable. At other times sequences become hodgepodges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fagan pasted together all sorts of movements in ''Traipsing Through the May'' and ''Two Pieces of One: Green,'' which Garth Fagan Dance presented on Thursday night at the Joyce Theater on a program that included a repeat performance of the new ''Trips and Trysts.''</p>
        <p>One does not expect simple narratives in any of Mr. Fagan's whimsically titled creations. ''Traipsing,'' to recorded cello concertos by Vivaldi, did have a subtitle: ''A Telling Tale of a Lovelorn Lass.'' And Nicolette Depass was its principal soloist. But storytelling and character development were not important here.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Fagan seemed interested in casting an amused eye on the ways people can primp, preen, fuss and fidget. David Moore put everyone into billowy costumes at the start of the work and, later, into skimpy outfits akin to bathing suits. The dancers usually fluttered to and fro in a coyly flirtatious manner.</p>
        <p>But some scenes were intense, among them a solo in which Ms. Depass kept bending in a way that made her appear melancholy as well as physically droopy, and a duet in which she and Norwood Pennewell drew cautiously closer. Most striking of all was an ensemble in which the propulsive choreography tossed dancers about and sent them kicking, squirming and rolling on the floor.</p>
        <p>One could wonder how these varied sequences were supposed to cohere. But the dancers seemed to relish every choreographic change.</p>
        <p>''Two Pieces of One: Green'' musically juxtaposed recordings of a taut contemporary jazz score by Tony Williams and serene vocal works by the 16th-century composer, Cristobal de Morales. The choreography, which featured eight dancers in the opening scene and six in the finale, emphasized abrupt starts and stops. In one effective moment, the dancers moved as if struggling against an invisible force exerting tremendous pressure upon them. Often, Mr. Fagan gave the impression that he was hobbling dancers with deliberately awkward steps, only to set them free again. But the purpose of these struggles remained puzzling.</p>
        <p>The company continues through tomorrow night at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea.</p>
