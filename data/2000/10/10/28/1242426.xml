        <p>Novo Nordisk is designing better enzymes for detergents. Dow Chemical is trying to cut the cost of food processing. Pioneer Hi-Bred is aiming for better crops, and MedImmune a stronger version of its main drug.</p>
        <p>What these works-in-progress have in common is their reliance on a new version of a process that is as old as life itself -- evolution.</p>
        <p>The process, known as directed molecular evolution, aims to harness the principle of survival of the fittest -- but at a microscopic level in a test tube rather than in the jungle, and in weeks rather than in millenniums.</p>
        <p>The result, proponents say, could be a whole panoply of improved drugs and industrial chemicals, and the creation of a new business sector. Three companies that specialize in directed molecular evolution -- Maxygen, Diversa and Applied Molecular Evolution -- have gone public in the last year. So has Genencor International, an enzyme company that uses directed evolution as one of its tools.</p>
        <p>Directed evolution works by making numerous mutations in a gene that produces a particular protein. These mutated genes are put into bacteria to make the mutated proteins, which are then tested to see how well they perform a given task. The genes for the best proteins can be mutated again and again in hopes of evolving an even better protein.</p>
        <p>This is somewhat similar to the breeding of crops and livestock, but in this case it is molecules, not living things, that are bred.</p>
        <p>''You can do better than nature,'' said James Young, executive vice president for research and development at Med Immune, a biotechnology company in Gaithersburg, Md.</p>
        <p>MedImmune is one company benefiting from directed evolution, which is also called molecular breeding. The company's two-year-old drug, Synagis, is an antibody used to prevent a serious infection in infants from respiratory syncytial virus. But treatment requires five injections over five months at a cost of $5,000, limiting Synagis's use to those most at risk -- mainly premature infants. If the drug could be made more potent, reducing the cost and number of injections, the market could be expanded to other infants.</p>
        <p>So MedImmune turned to Applied Molecular Evolution, which evolved several improved versions, the best of which is 30 times stronger than Synagis. MedImmune expects to begin clinical trials next year.</p>
        <p>For all its promise, however, directed evolution still remains largely unproved. Only three products -- all laundry detergent enzymes -- have reached the market so far. Some say the technique might be too costly and complex for some applications. Shares of Maxygen and Diversa, which have been public the longest, declined dramatically early this year along with the stocks of other biotechnology companies on concerns about gene patents.</p>
        <p>Until now, scientists have improved natural proteins by making specific changes to them, a process called protein engineering. But scientists usually do not know enough to predict the best changes to make.</p>
        <p>Directed evolution removes the need to understand the protein to improve it. ''Nature's been doing this for millions of years and nature has very little theory,'' said William D. Huse, founder and chief executive of Applied Molecular Evolution.</p>
        <p>Of course, if natural evolution has honed proteins for millions of years, one could reasonably ask if there is much room left for improvement. The answer is yes, because evolution selects proteins that help an organism survive and reproduce. It does not select for a protein that is good at, say, doing the wash.</p>
        <p>One use of directed evolution is to improve enzymes, which are proteins that speed up chemical reactions inside cells.</p>
        <p>Genencor used directed evolution to achieve a fivefold improvement in the stain-removing ability of a bacterial enzyme in a year. Using the older technique of protein engineering the company could make only a twofold improvement in two years. That enzyme, as well as two developed by rival Novo Nordisk, are in use in detergents.</p>
        <p>Still, the market for industrial enzymes is less than $2 billion a year. That's why some directed evolution companies are turning to pharmaceuticals, a much bigger market.</p>
        <p>Maxygen is developing improved versions of proteins that are already being sold as drugs by other companies, posing a potential threat to other biotechnology companies. The company, based in Redwood City, Calif., published a paper showing it could improve the antiviral activity of interferon alpha, now used to treat hepatitis C and other diseases, by as much as a factor of 285,000. Maxygen has licensed one such protein, which it will not identify, to H. Lundbeck, a Dutch drug company, which has not yet begun clinical trials.</p>
        <p>Russell J. Howard, president and chief executive of Maxygen, said patents on human proteins or genes held by other companies would not stop Maxygen because evolutionary techniques can be performed on the equivalent animal genes, which usually are not patented.</p>
        <p>There are two basic approaches to directed evolution, and they can be used separately or in combination.</p>
        <p>One is to create numerous mutations in a single gene. This is often done by deliberately introducing errors into a technique used to copy DNA. One way organisms evolve in nature is through chance mutations.</p>
        <p>The second way is to mimic another powerful method of evolution -- sexual reproduction. Two parents mix their genes and a different combination is given out to each child. No child is exactly like either parent and some children have traits not evident in either parent.</p>
        <p>In molecular sex, two or more similar genes are broken into pieces, which are then recombined in new configurations.</p>
        <p>Unlike natural sex, molecular sex is not restricted to the same species. Scientists trying to create a better hormone might cut and paste the genes for that hormone from humans, cows, pigs and mice. Nor is molecular sex restricted to two parents. Maxygen improved subtilisin, an enzyme used in detergents, by shuffling 26 subtilisin genes, each from a different type of bacteria.</p>
        <p>Maxygen pioneered the recombination approach, which it calls DNA shuffling. A similar approach is used by Enchira Biotechnology, a directed evolution company in a Houston suburb. Diversa and Applied Molecular Evolution tend to use mutations in a single gene.</p>
        <p>A drawback of the sexual approach is that some changes are not possible. Proteins are chains of amino acids, and if all the parent genes code for the same amino acid in a given position in the chain, then all the offspring will as well.</p>
        <p>The mutation approach, in contrast, can try out all 20 different amino acids at any given position. The drawback is that changes can only be made in one or two positions before the numbers become astronomical. In a typical 300-amino-acid protein, there are 5,700 ways to change just one amino acid, but 16 million ways to change two amino acids and 30 billion ways to change three.</p>
        <p>Despite its stock decline, Maxygen is rated by investors as the best of the breeders. Its market capitalization is about $1.3 billion, compared with $830 million for Diversa and $555 million for Applied Molecular.</p>
        <p>Maxygen was co-founded by Alejandro Zaffaroni, who also founded Alza, Affymetrix and other biotechnology companies. It is developing improved enzymes for Novo Nordisk, helping Pfizer with the manufacturing of a drug, developing better crop proteins for Pioneer Hi-Bred and AstraZeneca, and evolving biowarfare treatments for the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>Diversa, based in San Diego, collects microbes from extreme environments, like the polar ice caps and geysers. The company believes that enzymes that can survive harsh conditions make better starting points for evolving industrial enzymes.</p>
        <p>''You don't breed mules to make racehorses,'' said Jay M. Short, Diversa's president. ''You start with thoroughbreds.''</p>
        <p>Starting with an enzyme from bacteria found near deep-sea thermal vents, Diversa and its partner, Dow Chemical, are evolving an enzyme to convert starch into corn syrup under acidic conditions. Diversa is also working with Aventis Animal Nutrition and Celanese, among others.</p>
        <p>Applied Molecular, once known as Ixsys and also based in San Diego, focuses on antibodies. Besides improving MedImmune's respiratory drug, it has developed a cancer drug licensed to MedImmune.</p>
        <p>Enchira, once known as Energy Biosystems, tried to apply directed evolution to removing sulfur from oil but could not attract customers. So the company changed its name and repositioned itself as a pharmaceutical molecular evolution company. Its stock rose sharply, but the market valuation is still only $52 million.</p>
        <p>Evolution does not solve every problem. Scott D. Power, a research fellow at Genencor, said the technique was too complex for some applications. To develop a detergent enzyme that will not be destroyed by bleach, he said, it is simpler to change the part of the enzyme that is damaged by the bleach.</p>
        <p>And Glenn E. Nedwin, president of a research division of Novo Nordisk, said that while evolution can make new enzymes, it does not readily address a bigger problem -- making enzymes cheaper to compete with alternative chemicals. ''I have plenty of interesting enzymes that no one wants to buy because they can't compete, for example, with the price of chlorine,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Screening can also be difficult. Researchers at the California Institute of Technology tried to develop an enzyme for cold water detergents by evolving enzymes that could withstand colder and colder temperatures. The resulting enzymes could indeed survive cold water, but could not lift stains very well.</p>
        <p>''The fundamental rule of directed evolution is you get what you screen for,'' said Frances H. Arnold, a professor of chemical engineering and biochemistry at Caltech.</p>
        <p>But new horizons are opening beyond proteins. Maxygen has evolved a virus to carry genes into the body for gene therapy. And both Maxygen and Diversa are evolving entire micro-organisms to make them better at fermentation.</p>
        <p>Scientists are also evolving substances that are not proteins themselves but produced in organisms by  reactions directed by enzymes. By changing the enzymes, it is possible to change the final products.</p>
        <p>''Now we're evolving whole metabolic pathways,'' said Dr. Arnold, who has made bacteria produce carotenoids -- the nutrients that make carrots orange -- that they would not normally make.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, it might be possible to replace chemical factories with biological processes that use less energy and create less pollution. Maxygen this week announced an agreement with Chevron to develop such bioprocesses to produce specific petrochemical products. John Shanklin, a biochemist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, is evolving vegetable oils that could be used to make plastics.</p>
        <p>Enzymes could also be evolved to withstand the harsh conditions of chemical factories. Right now, because they work best at the moderate temperatures found in living things, enzymes are used mainly in detergents, food and textile processing and animal feeds.</p>
        <p>''There isn't any reason,'' Dr. Arnold said, that ''we couldn't base a whole chemical industry on biotechnology.''</p>
