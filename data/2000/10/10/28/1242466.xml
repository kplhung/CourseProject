        <p>This 30-second commercial, titled ''Divided,'' was released yesterday by Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for Senate from New Jersey, in his campaign against Representative Bob Franks. It is running on television stations in New York and Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Shrum, Devine &amp; Donilon.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The ad shows nothing but sun-splashed images of the United States Supreme Court building in Washington, shot from below so as to lend the narration an air of foreboding. Subtitles float by, amplifying the script; the words ''hangs in the balance'' suddenly tilt to the right.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''The Supreme Court is divided on whether Roe v. Wade will remain the law of the land. A woman's right to choose hangs in the balance. Jon Corzine has made it clear he will support judges who will protect a woman's right to choose. Bob Franks has made it clear he will support judges like Antonin Scalia, one of the current Supreme Court justices most determined to overturn Roe v. Wade. The choice: putting a woman's right to choose at risk with Bob Franks, or protecting a woman's right to choose with Jon Corzine.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Of the nine Supreme Court justices, three are committed to overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights decision: Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Justice Scalia and Justice Clarence Thomas. Mr. Franks, who says he supports abortion rights and Roe v. Wade, nonetheless favors some restrictions, like a ban on the late-term procedure called partial-birth abortion by its opponents, and a requirement that parents of teenage girls be notified before they have abortions. In a debate on Oct. 8, Mr. Corzine said he would have voted against Justice Scalia's confirmation. Mr. Franks said he did not know enough about Mr. Scalia at the time of his confirmation to say how he would have voted, but added, ''Justice Scalia has made an outstanding intellectual contribution to the court.''</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mr. Corzine, like Vice President Al Gore, here tries to alarm supporters of abortion rights over the possibility that his opponent would favor nominees to the Supreme Court who would make abortion illegal. By focusing on the somewhat slim chance that Roe v. Wade could soon be overturned, Mr. Corzine appeals to the overwhelming majority of New Jerseyans who support a basic right to abortion, with or without new restrictions. In doing so, he indirectly highlights what has been both a political strength and a weakness of Mr. Franks: his tendency to seem to take both sides of an important issue.</p>
