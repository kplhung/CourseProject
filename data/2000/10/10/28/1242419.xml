        <p>Three weeks after a shake-up of its top management, Prudential Securities is preparing to stop trading bonds for institutional clients and to lay off a few hundred traders and other employees, people close to the firm said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Prudential, which has struggled to compete in the bond business with bigger firms, has not been making money at it lately and wants to reduce the volatility of its trading results, the people said. The changes, expected to be announced next week, will not affect the bond sales and trading Prudential does for its individual customers, they said.</p>
        <p>Asked about the changes, Charles Perkins, a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Prudential, a unit of the Newark-based Prudential Insurance Company of America, is the sixth-biggest American brokerage firm with about 7,200 brokers in about 300 branches.</p>
        <p>Its chief executive, Hardwick Simmons, resigned three weeks ago and was replaced by John R. Strangfeld, who had overseen the insurance company's mutual fund operations. Mr. Simmons had been trying to find a buyer for the securities unit, but his bosses at the parent company decided not to sell it.</p>
        <p>Prudential Securities has sold about $8.2 billion in United States bonds this year, making it an also-ran in that category. The leading seller of debt, Merrill Lynch, has sold $193 billion.</p>
        <p>One of Prudential's strongest suits has been the creation and sale of bonds backed by mortgages and assets, like packages of consumer loans, but the firm has slipped in that business this year. The last two years, the firm has tried to build up its investment banking operation by buying small firms that specialized in underwriting stocks of technology and health care companies.</p>
