        <p>An uneasy calm returned to the Ivory Coast today as the new president and his opponents held meetings suggesting a truce in the political crisis that has shaken this corner of West Africa for a week.</p>
        <p>A day after politically fueled religious tensions exploded in deadly clashes in the slums and working-class quarters of Abidjan, the president and his main opponent met in an air-conditioned room here, sat on a beige sofa and, as flashbulbs exploded, shook hands.</p>
        <p>After the meetings, the new president, Laurent Gbagbo, left his gated villa in a motorcade, past the tanks and the soldiers carrying AK-47's stationed in front of his home.</p>
        <p>After arriving at the presidential palace, he formed what he called a government of national unity without allies of his main opponent, Alassane D. Ouattara, a Muslim northerner who was barred from running in the presidential election held on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ouattara, whose demand for a new election drew his supporters out into the streets, sounded a less resolute note today. He said he still hoped that a new election might take place. But he emphasized that his party's priority was ''to mourn our dead and to bury our supporters who died.''</p>
        <p>After touring the city today, officials of Mr. Ouattara's party said they had counted 155 dead, most of them his supporters. The number could not be confirmed independently. But as of Thursday, some 90 deaths had been tallied.</p>
        <p>And late today, 40 to 50 young men were discovered dead in a bushy area in Yopougon, a neighborhood north of the center of Abidjan, Ivory Coast's principal city. Most died of gunshots, said journalists who visited the site.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ouattara, a former prime minister and former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said his party would not join the national unity government immediately. But he said he might reconsider after legislative elections scheduled for December.</p>
        <p>The other major party, the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast, which ruled from independence until a military coup last December, has joined the government. After his meeting with the president, the party's secretary general, Laurent Dona Fologo, said he would not call for a new presidential election. His party received four cabinet positions in Mr. Gbagbo's government, out of 23.</p>
        <p>''The people of the Ivory Coast have suffered enough,'' Mr. Fologo said. ''I think they are fed up with the indecisiveness of politicians. Now we want to turn a new page with President Gbagbo.''</p>
        <p>The Democratic Party and Mr. Ouattara's party, the Rally of the Republicans, boycotted Sunday's presidential election after a court controlled by the leader of the ruling military junta, Gen. Robert Guei, disqualified their candidates. The boycott led to a voter turnout of only 37 percent and a victory for Mr. Gbagbo, which General Guei tried to annul on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>But in the most tumultuous week in this country's history, a broad-based uprising against the general led to his downfall on Wednesday. Mr. Gbagbo then declared himself president and -- enjoying the critical backing of France, the former colonial power -- rejected calls for a new election. Mr. Ouattara demanded one, and was echoed by the United States, the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.</p>
        <p>And so the two men's supporters fought with machetes and clubs on Thursday. The violence was intensified by the ethnic and religious divisions that General Guei and Mr. Gbagbo himself have inflamed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gbagbo and his followers are mainly Christians from the south. Mr. Ouattara's supporters are mostly Muslim northerners, many of whom have become targets of official discrimination.</p>
        <p>Events on Thursday made clear that the security troops backed Mr. Gbagbo; many were seen siding with his supporters against those of Mr. Ouattara. Gbagbo supporters, backed by paramilitary gendarmes, also attacked Mr. Ouattara's house with tear gas and gunfire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ouattara was forced to take refuge in the home of his next-door neighbor, the German ambassador. Overwhelmed, Mr. Ouattara and his supporters had no choice but to give up the street battle.</p>
        <p>And so this morning, after the nighttime curfew expired and there were no signs of further unrest, people all over Abidjan went back to work, shops reopened and buses and taxis were running again. Other cities where clashes occurred were also reported to be quiet today.</p>
        <p>Despite the truce, many problems behind the crisis persist just below the surface. If Mr. Ouattara ultimately decides not to join the government, it will be formed by members of two parties representing mostly the Christian south. Although Muslim northerners from Mr. Ouattara's party are bound to be elected in legislative elections in December, they might be shut out of the all-powerful executive and ministries.</p>
        <p>Even though Ivory Coast's population is 40 percent Muslim and 30 percent Christian, the country's three presidents since independence -- four now, with Mr. Gbagbo -- have all been Christians.</p>
        <p>Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who governed for three decades until his death in 1993, was credited with creating an open, multiethnic and multireligious nation. He maintained harmony with the northerners by bringing them into his government -- including Mr. Ouattara, who was prime minister from 1990 to 1993.</p>
        <p>But the presidents who followed -- Henri Konan Bedie, General Guei and now Mr. Gbagbo -- all chose to deal with the challenge of the Muslim north not by building ties, but by creating divisions between Christians and Muslims.</p>
