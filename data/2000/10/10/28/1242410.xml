        <p>ARGENTINA: SEEKS TO EXTRADITE PINOCHET  A judge asked Chile's Supreme Court to extradite the former dictator Augusto Pinochet for the killing of a former Chilean army chief, Carlos Prats, and his wife in Buenos Aires in 1974. General Pinochet, 84, is already fighting a possible trial in Chile for rights abuses during his 17-year rule. He returned home this year after 503 days under arrest in Britain. General Prats, who opposed General Pinochet's coup against President Salvador Allende in 1973, was killed by a car bomb.</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: PEACE TALKS  Manuel Marulanda, left, head of Colombia's largest rebel group, held talks with the government's lead negotiator, Camilo Gomez. The talks, which had been stalled for months, were held in a swath of rebel-controlled territory. Mr. Marulanda said he would like to meet with the head of the armed forces, but the environment for talks has been poisoned by what the government calls rebel aggression.</p>

        <p>CANADA: RACE GETTING TIGHTER  The election campaign heated up when a poll showed the new conservative opposition party, the Canadian Alliance, narrowing its gap with the governing Liberals by 15 points. According to a nationwide Ispos-Reid poll, 28 percent of 1,502 respondents said they would vote for the Alliance, up from 20 percent. The Liberals, the party of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, were at 45 percent, down from 52 percent. ''I sense momentum,'' said Stockwell Day, the Alliance leader.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: $21 MILLION FOR HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL  Parliament approved a budget of $21 million for the construction of a long-delayed Holocaust memorial next to the Brandenburg Gate. Initial estimates had put the cost at $7.5 million. Wolfgang Thierse, the speaker of Parliament, said construction of the monument, by the New York architect Peter Eisenman, would begin next year. Its size, location, cost and form continue to generate controversy.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: COMBAT ROLE FOR WOMEN  Women will be allowed to take on combat roles in the armed forces next year for the first time. By the required two-thirds majority, the Bundestag voted to amend the Constitution to allow women to take part in such missions. Up to now they have worked only as doctors, nurses and band members. The constitutional change is still to be approved by the upper house, where no opposition is expected.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: CONGRESSMAN'S PLEA REJECTED  President Vladimir V. Putin did not reply to a request for a meeting to discuss the case of Edmond Pope, an American businessman being tried on espionage charges, an American congressman pressing for Mr. Pope's release said. Representative John E. Peterson, Republican of Pennyslvania, said developments in the case amounted to ''disappointment after disappointment.'' Separately, judges also refused a request by Mr. Pope's wife, Cheri, to meet with him for a second time this week.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: BOMB THREAT  A bomb threat forced top bureaucrats, including Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, to evacuate their Moscow headquarters, known as the White House. An unidentified male caller said a bomb would go off at 3 p.m. The building was evacuated, but an official said no bomb was found. Two Moscow apartment buildings were destroyed by bombs last fall, and 13 people died in a blast in an underground passageway in August.</p>

        <p>IRELAND: NEW OMAGH SUSPECTS  The police detained three more men for questioning in connection with the 1998 bombing in Omagh, Northern Ireland, that killed 29 people. Terrorism suspects can be held for three days without being formally charged. Seven arrests in the bombing have been made this month.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: MOB KILLINGS ON BORNEO  A raging mob of young men decapitated two people and paraded their heads on sticks through the streets on Borneo as ethnic violence continued unabated in West Kalimantan, raising the death toll to seven in three days. The police declared a nighttime curfew and vowed to send reinforcements to contain clashes between Malay gangs and migrants. Hundreds died in a similar conflict last year.</p>

        <p>TANZANIA: KEY VOTE DUE  Tanzanians will hold an election tomorrow that analysts and diplomats say could spell the end of the union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar. The opposition Civic United Front is expected to win a majority in the Zanzibar House of Representatives and dent the governing party's majority on the mainland, developments that diplomats believe will hasten the island's drive for greater independence.</p>

        <p>RWANDA: 2 PRIESTS FREED  An appeals court threw out the convictions of two Roman Catholic priests sentenced to death for their role in the country's mass killings of 1994 and set them free, the attorney general said. Edouard Nturiye and Francois Kayiranga were convicted and sentenced to death in 1998 on charges that they had organized the killing of 2,000 minority Tutsi who died when the church in which they had sought shelter was bulldozed on top of them.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: WAGNER PROTEST  The first concert performance in Israel of a work by Richard Wagner, Hitler's favorite composer, was about to begin when a man in the audience swung a noisy rattle in protest. Others quietened the 80-year-old Polish-born man, whose family died in the Holocaust, and the performance of the ''Siegfried Idyll'' went on. Holocaust survivors had tried to bar the performance.</p>
