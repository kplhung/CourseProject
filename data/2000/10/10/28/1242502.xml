        <p>A convicted robber has been arrested in the 1995 killing of a retired schoolteacher who was savagely beaten on a residential street in Queens when she refused to let go of her purse, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The convict, Christos Georgiou, 29, who the authorities said had robbed women to support his drug habit, was arrested Thursday and charged with second-degree murder in the May 29, 1995, attack on the teacher, Yorkia Gens, 75, the police said.</p>
        <p>Long a suspect in the killing, Mr. Georgiou is on parole for a second-degree robbery conviction stemming from a series of purse snatchings in Queens that occurred in 1995, the police said. He was paroled this year.</p>
        <p>The slight, frail Ms. Gens, who lived nearby, was attacked by two men as she walked along 80th Road near Grenfell Street, a block from Forest Park in Kew Gardens, the police said. She was on her way to her car to pick up her disabled daughter at a Queens hospital.</p>
        <p>She was punched to the ground and savagely kicked by Mr. Georgiou and another man, the police said. She was hospitalized and died five days later from internal bleeding and trauma.</p>
        <p>''She wouldn't let go of her bag,'' said Detective Steven J. Berger, who interviewed Ms. Gens in the hospital and has been investigating the case on and off for five years. ''They just kept kicking her and punching her.''</p>
        <p>David Chesney, 50, who the police say was Mr. Georgiou's accomplice, pleaded guilty to first-degree robbery on Dec. 7, 1998, in connection with the killing and was sentenced to 8 and a third to 25 years in prison. But it was not until Thursday that Detective Berger had collected enough evidence, including statements from witnesses who had previously been reluctant to come forward, to arrest Mr. Georgiou, he said.</p>
