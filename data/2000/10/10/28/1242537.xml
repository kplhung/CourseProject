        <p>Manny Ramirez and Mike Mussina, two of the most talented players eligible for free agency, were among the first 10 players to file yesterday, the first day of the filing period. Also on the list was Mike Bordick, the Mets' shortstop, who was the first World Series player to file for free agency.</p>
        <p>Eligible players can become free agents in the 15-day period after the end of the World Series. During that time, once they file, they can negotiate a contract only with the team with which they finished the season.</p>
        <p>That means the Cleveland Indians can still negotiate with Ramirez, their right fielder, who drove in 122 runs this season despite missing 44 games with injuries, and the Baltimore Orioles with Mussina, whose 11-15 won-lost record was the worst of his career but most likely will not knock down his asking price. Ramirez is expected to emerge from his free-agency experience as one of the highest-paid players in baseball, very likely commanding more than the $17 million a year Carlos Delgado received from Toronto.</p>
        <p>The Mets acquired Bordick from the Orioles July 28 after Rey Ordonez fractured his left arm. Bordick began his stay with the Mets impressively, but tailed off and wound up hitting .260. He batted .125 in the World Series.</p>
        <p>Among the 157 eligible players who filed for free agency were Sandy Alomar Jr. of Cleveland, Todd Hundley of Los Angeles, Shawon Dunston of St. Louis, Jeffrey Hammonds and Todd Hollandsworth of Colorado, Dave Magadan of San Diego and Tom Lampkin of Seattle.</p>
