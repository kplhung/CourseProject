        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report that families in which both parents work have now edged into a 51 percent majority of married couples with children (news article, Oct. 24). What is surprising is not that it has happened, but that it has only just happened.</p>
        <p>For years the politically correct rhetoric in areas as diverse as family law and television advertising has been that two working parents are the normative structure. But working-mother hype overlooks the flip side of the numbers: nonworking mothers are an amazingly large group.</p>
        <p>Stay-at-home mothers have been marginalized by assumptions that overlook them and proclamations celebrating the number of working mothers. Now that they have become a minority, let's not discount them entirely.</p>
        <p>CYNTHIA LEE STARNES  East Lansing, Mich., Oct. 24, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of family law at Michigan State University.</p>
