        <p>The people of New York knew that it would have to end, the way they know that the winds of November will soon be blustering up Broadway. Still, this thing of theirs, this World Series, seemed to end all too soon.</p>
        <p>And so they stumbled into yesterday's morning light, resigned to put aside the whimsies of fantasy for the realities of life. There are a couple of elections to think about, including one that has something to do with determining the country's leader. There is even that unpleasant duty of setting clocks back tonight, to prepare for the shorter days of tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Of course, in a city as diverse and as eye-rollingly above it all as New York, some found blessed relief Thursday in the Yankees' fourth and final victory over the Mets. They have a point, perhaps, in questioning the charm of people belching out of neighborhood bars to loudly defame others on the basis of team allegiances.</p>
        <p>But for the many -- even those who have long since wearied of baseball-is-the-cosmos metaphors -- there lingered the sense of having shared something fleeting yet memorable. So what if television ratings suggest that the rest of the country preferred watching test patterns to tuning in to the World Series? Here in New York, the glow of its images lit up the nights.</p>
        <p>So pervasive was baseball in a single metropolis that Frank's, a white-linen steakhouse at the Lower Manhattan end of 10th Avenue,  bought a $400 television set to erect above the small bar -- thus ending 88 years of insistence that nothing distract customers from the cuts of beef laid before them. It was a reluctant and temporary concession by the owners, the Molinari family.</p>
        <p>''It's like cooking a steak well done; you don't like it, but you have to do it,'' said George Molinari, the restaurant's chef and a devoted Met fan. ''But the series was more of a New York event than it was a baseball event.''</p>
        <p>Now, the television will come down, he said. And while life in the city began returning to its normal rhythms, mental snapshots of moments both absurd and sublime have been set aside for later.</p>
        <p>There was the man running down Eagle Street in Brooklyn one evening, screaming: ''Do you understand, people? Do you understand? Not since 1956! Not since 1956!'' There was the minister on the No. 7 train, bound for Game 4 on Wednesday night, sheepishly admitting to having hurried an evening service in order to be present for the first pitch.</p>
        <p>And there was Tim Britt, a 45-year-old contractor and cabinetmaker from Brooklyn, dreamily recalling a rare moment of self-awareness. He is a Yankee fan who managed to secure a ticket for Game 3 at Shea Stadium, through means he would just as soon not share. On Monday, the day before the game, he picked up his ticket and veered his Ford Explorer onto the Jackie Robinson Parkway for the ride home.</p>
        <p>''I took a peek in the rear-view mirror and I realized I had this smile on my face from ear to ear,'' he said. ''There are very few moments in life where you have pure delight. And that was one of them.''</p>
        <p>From Game 1's first pitch by Andy Pettitte of the Yankees last Saturday  to the moment Yankee center fielder Bernie Williams accepted the gift of a fly ball for Game 5's final out late Thursday night, the elements cooperated. There was no rain or chill to impeach the integrity of any player's grip on the baseball.</p>
        <p>So too did the nearly 300,000 fans who attended the five games, according to Police Chief Bernard Kerik. The combined statistics for serious crimes committed at Shea and Yankee Stadiums on game nights amount to little more than what one might expect from a rowdy night in Mayberry: seven disorderly conducts, three criminal trespasses and one assault.</p>
        <p>''When you think of all these other cities, particularly L.A., where at the end of some of these games they go out and destroy the city, burn down buildings and turn over cars,'' Mr. Kerik said, in a stream-of-consciousness reflection. ''Between the fans really behaving themselves and the cops doing their job -- that's what resulted in such a great Series.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most egregious act of aggression occurred between the white lines of the baseball diamond, and not in the foul territory that was the rest of the city.</p>
        <p>It came during Game 2 on Sunday night, when Yankee pitcher Roger Clemens fielded the jagged piece of a bat shattered by a pitch to Met batter Mike Piazza, who had been hit in the head by a Clemens pitch earlier in the year. Clemens aggressively tossed the bat in the general direction of Piazza, earning the pitcher a $50,000 fine from Major League Baseball and the enmity of many baseball fans.</p>
        <p>The incident was one of the few not to be exploited by the many vendors of Subway Series ephemera. The foot-long souvenir bats they sold for $9.99 remained intact.</p>
        <p>For a day or so, the Clemens incident threatened to overshadow not only his own dominant pitching performance, but the entire Series. But perspective returned, and the Series came to be seen for what it was: a string of five games in which victory was never determined by more than two runs, in which veteran Yankee players calmly delivered and young Met players betrayed their inexperience.</p>
        <p>The games provided several of those electrifying moments that will help people to remember, years from now, where they were when the Subway Series took place.</p>
        <p>Howling in front of that bodega in the Bronx, when Derek Jeter threw out Timo Perez at the plate during that first game, the longest in World Series. Slapping fists with others in the Carriage House bar in Brooklyn, when Luis Sojo's mischievous  grounder squiggled up the middle to score Jorge Posada and Scott Brosius to win the last game. Watching Mike Piazza's fly ball arc into a Queens night during that same last game, knowing immediately that it would not carry far enough, and turning toward the Shea Stadium exit so as not to witness the celebration of others.</p>
        <p>And for all those direct, visceral connections between the athletic and the sedentary, there were the delayed cultural ripples that follow a baseball being tossed into a civic pond.</p>
        <p>In the city's schools, teachers struggled to keep their students alert from so many late-night games -- sometimes by exploring the didactic possibilities to be found in the length of a bat and the number of syllables in Benny Agbayani. On the city's airwaves, the screams and malapropisms and esoterica that define sports-talk radio suddenly -- scarily -- began to make sense.</p>
        <p>For the literary-minded, Piazza, the Met superstar, wrote daily diaries for The New York Post. At one point, he wrote with so much passion about the Clemens bat incident that he used 17 epithets, which appeared in print as ''bleeping,'' ''bleeped'' and ''bleep.'' He apologized for the preponderance of bleeps, but said that he was a little emotional.</p>
        <p>Piazza's girlfriend, Darlene Bernaola, at the very start of her reign as Playboy Playmate of the Millennium, was among the many celebrities who attended the games and studied the action as though world peace depended on it. There was Jerry Seinfeld, Larry King and a Baldwin brother or two. Along the way, a city learned that Matthew Broderick roots for the Mets and Sarah Jessica Parker for the Yankees; still, the city was assured, the actors love each other.</p>
        <p>There, too, standing stiffly on the No. 7 train to Shea Stadium on Tuesday night, was the state Republican party's answer to Tinker, Evers and Chance: Pataki, Giuliani and Lazio. Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose baseball allegiance hovers somewhere between Chicago and New York -- perhaps in Pittsburgh -- attended no games.</p>
        <p>For a while, it seemed that the on-field excitement and off-field distraction would last forever, as though they had established permanent presence in a city's day-to-day psyche. This sense was reinforced by the length of the games, which each night ended near or after midnight.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, it ended. A Sojo grounder up the middle, a flyout by Piazza to left-center field. Half a city celebrated; half turned off their televisions and radios and tried to sleep.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Yankee and Met fans everywhere struggled to define the parameters of their post-Series relationships. Some Yankee fans heckled those Met fans brave enough to wear their team's orange and blue; others spoke kindly of their wounded brethren, glowing in the magnanimity that comes easily with victory.</p>
        <p>''It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't the Yankees,'' said Tim Smythe, a grip working on the production of a commercial in the West Village. He looked for reassurance from Tom Kudlek, a colleague and fellow Met fan.</p>
        <p>''And I'll tell you --'' Mr. Smythe said, but he could not finish the thought. ''I don't know, man, it really hurts,'' he finally said, before slapping Mr. Kudlek on the shoulder and walking away.</p>
        <p>The most eloquent Yankee response to Met pain was delivered several miles away in Brooklyn. For days, neighborhood children had been scrawling ''Let's Go Mets'' on the sidewalk in front of the Carroll Gardens home of Brian Merro, leaving him no choice but to squirt them away with a garden hose.</p>
        <p>Now, it was his turn. With neither shirt nor shame, he stepped out onto his stoop and began to sing a song about champions, a song that employed the all-inclusive ''we.''</p>
