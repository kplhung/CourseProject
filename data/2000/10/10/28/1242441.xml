        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>SUPPORT FOR GOVERNOR'S WIDOW  She is not on the Missouri ballot for the United States Senate. And she has given no indication that she would serve if appointed. But a campaign to put Jean Carnahan in the Senate is nevertheless well under way, with support groups forming, one rally already held, more planned and e-mail messages that promote her flying in every direction.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Carnahan is the widow of Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri, a popular Democrat killed this month in a plane crash while campaigning to unseat Senator John Ashcroft, a Republican. His death came too late in the campaign to put a substitute Democrat on the ballot. Should Mr. Carnahan win, and polls taken in the past few days indicate the race is a tossup, the new governor, Roger Wilson, a Democrat and Mr. Carnahan's lieutenant governor, has promised to appoint Mrs. Carnahan to serve for her husband.</p>

        <p>Mrs. Carnahan says it is too soon to commit to anything, and Missouri Republicans question the legality of the plan.</p>

        <p>SUDDENLY, TOSSUPS  New polls indicate that the Senate races in Virginia and Michigan, once one-sided, are now tossups.</p>
        <p>In Virginia, a Mason-Dixon survey taken this week found the incumbent Democrat, Senator Charles S. Robb, had closed to within three percentage points of his Republican challenger, former Gov. George Allen. For almost two years, Mr. Allen had enjoyed a comfortable lead in the polls over Mr. Robb. But in recent weeks, Mr. Robb has steadily closed the gap, thanks mainly to gains among women.</p>
        <p>In Michigan, an EPIC/MRA poll taken this week found that Representative Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat, had pulled even with the Republican incumbent, Spencer Abraham, after trailing him for months. Two weeks ago, an EPIC/MRA poll found her 10 points behind. She and Senator Abraham together have spent more than $16 million on the contest.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>GORE AND THE RAP STAR  In Vice President Al Gore's latest appeal to young voters, he sat for an interview with Queen Latifah, a rap singer and syndicated talk-show host whose audience is chiefly between 18 and 24, a lot of them generally switched off by politicians.</p>
        <p>In the interview, to be broadcast on Wednesday, Queen Latifah, whose real name is Dana E. Owens, gave Mr. Gore a ''pop-culture quiz,'' asking if he had ever worn leather pants.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I have,'' he said. But he had a leather vest for riding his Harley, he said.</p>
        <p>Ever been caught speeding?</p>
        <p>''I don't think I ever got caught speeding on my motorcycle,'' Mr. Gore answered. ''Certainly I got caught speeding in my car when I was younger. But that wasn't to say I wasn't speeding sometimes on my motorcycle. I look back on those days and I feel like I'm very lucky to have survived.''</p>
        <p>Then he added: ''Once, on a dare, we went double-dating on my motorcycle.'' At the time, he went on, he was wearing a tuxedo. Did he get pulled over?</p>
        <p>''Actually, there was a blue light,'' Mr. Gore answered. ''And I can't say for sure that they were coming after us, but just on the chance that they were, we cut through an alleyway.''</p>
        <p>And finally: ''On a woman, leather or lace?'' Mr. Gore mulled for a moment, then answered: ''Lace.''</p>

        <p>THE INTEREST GROUPS</p>
        <p>UNION DOLLARS FOR GORE  The political action committee of New York State's largest health-care union sent a $1 million check to the Democratic National Committee this week to bolster the campaign of Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>The contribution, by 1199/S.E.I.U., New York's Health and Human Service Union, followed an earlier donation of $1 million to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and a $600,000 donation to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</p>
        <p>''We are alarmed about the prospect of having George Bush as the next president and about the impact that will have on the labor movement,'' said Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, a division of the Service Employees International Union.</p>

        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>ASSISTED-SUICIDE VOTE  Residents of Maine vote next month on a ballot initiative that would allow very ill patients of sound mind to ask their doctors for medication to help them die. The latest poll on the Oregon-style proposal, conducted last weekend by Strategic Marketing Services, found the electorate evenly divided, 43.5 percent for, 43.5 percent against and the rest undecided. In mid-September, a poll by the same company found that 67 percent of the state's voters supported the initiative.</p>
        <p>States like Michigan, where a similar initiative was defeated in 1998, have seen a similar dynamic as Election Day approached. Some analysts say it may be because people support assisted suicide in general, but become troubled by the details of any particular law.</p>
