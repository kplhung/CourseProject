        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- . . . We live in an age of polls and focus groups.

        <p>Following are excerpts from the debate yesterday between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio, as recorded by The New York Times. The moderator was Gabe Pressman of WNBC-TV in New York:</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- . . . We live in an age of polls and focus groups. And many people have the impression that candidates are programmed to respond to issues according to what their advisers believe the voters want. Can you give me one example where you have taken an unpopular course despite what your advisers say because you thought it was right?</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Sure. Absolutely. I've done that many times, Gabe. In Congress, supporting Nafta and the assault weapons ban after receiving thousands and thousands of calls from people who wanted me to go in a different direction, because I felt it was the right thing to do. I think it's very important to stand up for your beliefs. Even in this race, I know there are a lot of people who would like to see casino gambling. In one of our former debates, I expressed my personal opposition to casino gambling although I believe in the end it's a state decision. So I think there are many, many times when I have demonstrated independence on a whole range of issues. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Mrs. Clinton . . . what about you?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Well, I'll give you two, Gabe. You know, back in 1983 -- when I was probably the first person in the country who said that we should test teachers -- that was extremely unpopular, and it caused quite an uproar. But it was the right thing to do, and I still believe today that we should be testing new teachers and raising standards for our teachers. And then in 1995, when I went to China to speak on behalf of women's rights, there were many people, inside and outside our own government, people literally around the world, who said I shouldn't go, that I shouldn't make a speech, that I shouldn't criticize the Chinese government. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Do you think that there's a feeling abroad, a feeling among the people of America, many of them, that there's a lot of pandering going on, that there's kind of weather vane changes in positions?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Well, I think that in this presidential year there are very big differences between the candidates, just as there are in my race. Sometimes those differences may not be as clearly stated or defined as I think they would be in the White House or in the Congress. But for me, looking at this election, I'm struck by what different views my opponent and I have, what different views the two presidential candidates that we support have. Everything from how we would use the surplus and protect Social Security and Medicare to education ----</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- That's not my question. My question is, is there a kind of perception that candidates are weather vanes? That they change according to the polls?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Well, there may be. I don't know. I'm so focused on what I'm trying to do that I'm mostly paying attention to my own race and what I believe.</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- And you?</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Yeah, I believe there is. I think that's why there's a lot of cynicism among young people. They think that people -- and I think this White House in particular has been known for its extensive use of polling and focus groups and survey data to make decisions. And I think the American people want someone to lead. They want people to lead. For example, I think it was important when the United Nations Security Council voted to condemn Israel for the use of force, which I think was an abomination. I think it was wrong for America to sit on the sidelines. It didn't take me a day to put my finger up in the wind and decide which way public opinion was going. It took me only a couple hours to issue a statement expressing strong condemnation ----</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- You don't use pollsters at all?</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Oh, of course. I mean, of course every candidate, I think, uses pollsters. The question is whether you determine your positions based on polling. And clearly that's not the case. I just wanted to go back to what Mrs. Clinton said before because I think it's important -- on the educational issue. Mrs. Clinton said that she was for teacher testing. Well, but only for new teachers. And what type of testing? In Arkansas, Mrs. Clinton, when you had responsibility for education, the student performance when you left was at the bottom of the barrel. Spending was up. Taxes were up. Student performance at the bottom of the barrel. And out of the governor, now president's own mouth, he said: ''Well, we had to adjust the test. We had to dumb down the tests so that teachers could pass.'' That was a failure. And I think right now I'm for teacher competency exam -- examinations for teachers whether they're new teachers,  but more importantly teachers that have been in the system for some time. I don't understand why you would not want to have  examinations for teachers that were already in the system that are perhaps failing our children.</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Let me ask a teachers type question of you, Mrs. Clinton. About this history in Arkansas, true or false?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Well, it's false, Gabe. And you know, the work that was done in Arkansas received numerous awards and praise, because we really started something that I'm very proud of. And test scores went up in third grade and sixth grade. High school graduation went up. The work that was done was done against great odds. It obviously was then a very poor state. But what's important is what we're going to do in the future. I'm taking the experience that I had where we did test all teachers. And a lot of changes have happened. I've been involved in this now for 17 years, working on behalf of education reform. And I think we know what works. We know that getting classroom size down works. That's why I'm for adding 100,000 teachers to the classroom. We know that modernizing and better equipping our schools works. And we know that high standards works. . . . But what's important is to stay committed to the public school system, not siphon off money, as my opponent would, with vouchers . . .</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- We'll get to vouchers. But . . . is it true what he says -- that you're for testing new teachers but not teachers who are already in the system?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- That's right. And that's what the New York law is. You know, I agree that we should be testing new teachers. I believe that we ought to have pay for performance where we evaluate teachers. I think we ought to streamline the due process standards so that teachers that don't measure up would no longer be in the classroom. And I have a long record of achievement and advocacy on behalf of improving education . . . .</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- See, I have a very different perspective. I have a very different perspective on your record in Arkansas. And I would just urge the voters not to rely on what I'm saying or perhaps even what Mrs. Clinton is saying, with all due respect. But to look it up with their computers, do some research. Because in almost the entire range of student performance . . . there was a dramatic reduction in achievement as a result of ----</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- You know, Gabe, I'm not -- I'm not here to defend Arkansas. I'm here to run for the Senate to represent New York.</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Could -- could I just try to finish my point. Gabe, could I finish my point now?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- I take great, great offense at his misinterpreting and mischaracterizing what went on.</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Could I finish my point?</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- O.K. You finish your point.</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- I realize that you don't want to talk about Arkansas because that experience was a disaster for Arkansas.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- I'm happy to talk about it if that's what you want to spend your time talking about, Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- But what's important ----</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Well, let's ----</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Because that's your record, Mrs. Clinton. And with all due respect, you can't run away from your record.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Well, we have -- we will have posted on the Web site the facts for anyone who's interested . . .</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- . . . There is a difference on the question of teacher testing. We've established that. What about on vouchers?</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Sure. Well, but could I say also it confounds me, actually, why you would say to a new teacher that just came out of school and has learned, hopefully, the most current up-to-date methodology for teaching, and they're accustomed to using computers as teaching tools in the classroom -- why you would say it's O.K. for them but it's not O.K. for somebody that's been out there and teaching for 15 years and may have lost touch with their ability to use the latest techniques. And I think it's because in the end I'm not trapped by the status quo. I'm not trapped by the student -- by the teachers' unions, which I think Mrs. Clinton is. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Are you trapped by the teachers unions, as he says?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- No. In fact I'm very much in line with what I think will work and what experts in the field think. You know, I'm a lawyer. I had to take a bar exam. I think Mr. Lazio's a lawyer. He took a bar exam and he wasn't tested every five years. I happen to think teachers are professionals and should be treated as professionals. That's why I believe that we should test teachers in the beginning to make sure that when they got their teaching degree, when they got their B.A. from whatever school they graduated from, they're qualified. And then I believe we should have continuing legal education . . .</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Can I try to make a couple points here, because I think there's a major difference between Mrs. Clinton and myself on education? . . .</p>
        <p>The truth is . . . that I believe in making changes to put our children first. Mrs. Clinton believes in making sure that decision making on education stays in Washington. I want teachers and parents to make decisions about their education.</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- O.K., you have a chance for a rebuttal here, Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Well, thank you, Gabe. I mean, you don't know where to start with Mr. Lazio. He does go on.</p>
        <p>But the fact is that when I started back in 1983 and proposed teacher testing, I knew that it needed to be done in that particular circumstance. But we've done a lot to improve standards. But I do want to test new teachers and I do want continuing education and professional advancement and development for our teachers. And I do support pay for performance and I do support adding qualified teachers to the classroom.</p>
        <p>Where we part company is that he doesn't support, for example, the 100,000 teachers in the classroom in Congress. And he has not gone along with the bipartisan plan to build and repair our schools so that we actually can have those lower classroom sizes. And he supports vouchers, which I oppose.</p>
        <p>So I think that any fair reading of the record would show that we do have significant differences.</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- . . . On the vouchers thing.</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Can I -- out of fairness I think it's important. Because Mrs. Clinton has repeated these things several times, both in her commercials, which The Daily News has called her on and called her advertising absolutely false, and now I want a chance to be able to rebut that.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, you well know by now, because I know you're a smart woman, that I have voted twice to reduce class size, twice for billions to help us recruit new teachers. I have been a co-sponsor of bipartisan legislation for school construction. You know that.</p>
        <p>What's important here is that we understand the difference between the two candidates. Mrs. Clinton believes that all the decisions should be made in Washington, that we should force categorical programs. I understand that communities should be making those decisions on a community-by-community basis. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- O.K. Let me blow the whistle here on the education issue.</p>
        <p>Some headlines from a selection of press releases and commercials by both campaigns: ''Hillary Clinton plays politics with women's health again.'' ''The latest distortions from the Clinton campaign.''</p>
        <p>And from your side: ''Lazio points fingers, plays politics instead of voting for a resolution condemning Palestinian violence.'' ''Lazio soft-money hypocrisy.''</p>
        <p>You would think from all these things that I read . . . that you dislike each other. Is that true?</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Well, I think that the difference is here, it's not a matter of personal dislike, I think it's a matter for, on our side, to point at the differences between candidates and the philosophy between two candidates.</p>
        <p>I think, for example, it's important to point out on a number of different issues that there's a major difference. . . .</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- This is what's called a filibuster, Gabe.</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Yeah, let me ask you about the emotional content here. Do you dislike him?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- No. I think that I have no personal animus at all toward Mr. Lazio. He seems like a very, you know, nice person. I just have a great deal of ----</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Well, name three things that you like about him. And you name three things you like about her.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Well, it seems like he has a very nice family. And that he, you know, has worked very hard. And that, you know, he's an attractive young man.</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Well, I think you're an attractive woman. And I think you've got a very nice family. I'm sure you're a very good mother as well.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Thank you very much. But that's not what this election's about. And what it is about are the very significant differences between us on everything like education and health care and the economy and the environment and guns and choice and Social Security and the budget surplus. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Let's talk about some of these issues. In recent weeks, scores of people have been killed in the Middle East. Palestinian leaders have blamed Israel and vice versa. Israeli Prime Minister Barak made far-reaching concessions, in his view, to the Palestinians. But in view of what's happened, do you think there should be a Palestinian state now?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Only as part of a comprehensive peace agreement. That's always been my position. That if there were a comprehensive peace agreement that guaranteed Israel's safety and security and the parties agreed at the negotiating table.</p>
        <p>But a unilateral declaration is absolutely unacceptable and it would mean the end of any U.S. aid.</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- What about you?</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Well, I guess that's a change of heart for Mrs. Clinton, because back in 1998 you called for a Palestinian state. You undercut the Israeli negotiating position. And the administration had to rush in to try and distance themselves from you.</p>
        <p>The problem is . . . that many people around the world and the Palestinian Authority looks at you and your comments and your proximity to the White House and your role in the White House. And when you call for a Palestinian state, when you accept contributions from people that support Hamas, when you invite them to the White House and they're your guests, you send a message out to the world and to the Palestinian Authority that encourages violence to be used as a tool to achieve political ends.</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Wait a minute. Didn't your presidential candidate, George W. Bush, also accept contributions?</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- That's absolutely -- well the difference is -- it's absolutely wrong for all, it's absolutely wrong for all. The difference, though, on top of receiving the contributions and attending the fund-raiser and being honored by a group, the leader of which says it is perfectly acceptable to use murder and violence as a tool to achieve political ends, is that people who support the Hamas group, which is a terrorist group, have been invited and courted at the White House, which I think is wrong. And I think it's one reason why ----</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Am I going to get a chance? I'm happy to sit here and let him go on if that's how we want to spend the hour.</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- But Mrs. Clinton, frankly, that's your record.</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- No. She has a right to answer ----</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- But I think it's appropriate, Gabe -- after he's done so many, made so many inaccurate statements ----</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Which ones?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- You know, Gabe ----</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- O.K. I'm the speaker of the House, you're a member. Go ahead.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Thank you, Gabe. You know, Gabe, I learned that an organization claimed credit for sponsoring a fund-raiser I attended. And it's an organization whose members have made statements that I find offensive and have condemned. And as soon as I found out the facts, I returned all of the money that was raised because I did not want anyone to have a false impression about my strong support for Israel's safety and security. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Abe Foxman, the head of the A.D.L., the Anti-Defamation League, says that these organizations, these Muslim organizations, can be in the mainstream when they condemn terrorism.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- I agree with that. Abe and I have talked about that. I agree with that. That certainly every American should be part of the political process. But no American should in any way give aid and comfort to terrorists. And it's especially important today when we see the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole and the loss of 17 of our young men and women, which was just an evil act of terrorism.</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Do you have a comment, briefly?</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- I do want to comment if I can. I think first of all that the people of New York want to have somebody who has a consistent record. And for eight years I have been consistent and strong in my support for the security of the state of Israel. Without equivocation. Without a question mark next to my name.</p>
        <p>You know, it is important for people to understand, when you cavort with terrorists, with people that pronounce that violence and murder can be used as a tool to achieve political ends, you give them credibility. You embolden them and you send a message out to the world. Now, I think it was important that in the hours after the United States failed to use its veto, to -- in the U.N. Security Council -- which I think was one of the great mistakes of the last few years, that I spoke out immediately. I'm sure that Mrs. Clinton had a chance to speak with her husband about this, with the president about this, to urge him not to use that veto. I would love to know what the context of the discussion was.</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- To urge him not to use it or to use it?</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- To urge him to use the veto.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- That was what I urged my husband to do. He made a different decision. But you know, when we're talking about strong and unequivocal support, there is no question mark next to me. There's an exclamation point. I am an emphatic, unwavering supporter of Israel's safety and security. And in fact I've done it at some cost indeed, Mr. Lazio, because ----</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Could I ask a question?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- When the independent -- let me finish, please -- when the Independence Party was considering who to nominate, I made it very clear that I would not run on a party line with Pat Buchanan because of his anti-Semitic comments. You were more than happy to accept that particular line ----</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Mrs. Clinton, that's not totally accurate. That's not totally accurate. First of all, your people ----</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Well, that's how it was reported.</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Your people were up there working hard for that, No. 1. No. 2 is ----</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- They were working hard for the Independence ----</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- No. 2, could I ----</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- You know, I've specifically said publicly that I wouldn't take it if they nominated Pat Buchanan. It was up to them to decide what to do and they would not make that ----</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Could I try and finish my point, Gabe, if I can? And I'm happy to try and ----</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Why wouldn't you take it?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Because I wouldn't want to be associated with Pat Buchanan, who has a record of anti-Semitic comments. And I made that very clear at the time. You can go back and look at my comments.</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- And you know I answered questions from you, Gabe, how I felt about him and condemned him and the fact that he has been intolerant. But the point is it's very hard to accept a record or a claim of consistency when you called for a Palestinian state with full military powers. It's very difficult to accept that you are a consistent supporter when you stand on the sidelines while Suha Arafat issues a blood libel suggesting that Israelis have been orchestrating an attack on Palestinian women and children with poison. It's very difficult for ----</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- What about that Suha Arafat thing? As long as you brought it up.</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- . . . for us to imagine you've been a consistent supporter when you refused to support the law which says that we should move our embassy to Jerusalem, not next year, not at the end of the year, after eight years, but right now. For eight years I've wanted the embassy to be placed in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- You know, I can only respond because, you know, as The Forward said when they endorsed me, Jewish voters should reject smear campaigns, inaccurate information ----</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- But what's inaccurate about that?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- . . . much of which is floating around.</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- But what's inaccurate about that? Be fair.</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Hang on.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- You know, my positions -- my positions for more than 20 years have been to do everything I could to support Israel and to increase the relationships between the United States and Israel. I've worked on everything from the National Council of Jewish Women's program to bring a pre-instruction, preschool instruction program for children of the United States, you know, to speaking out, time and time again, about violence and terrorism. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Did you accept the Independence nomination?</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- No.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- That's because it wasn't offered.</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- No. It wasn't offered to either one of us, to be fair about that. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- O.K. Campaign finance. The issue has been raised kind of inferentially previously. But one thing that disturbs people about your fund-raising, Mr. Lazio, is that you've taken contributions from the housing industry, and that you serve on a committee that regulates housing. Is this likely to instill confidence in the voters?</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Well, I think that if you look at the average donation that I receive, it's like less than $100, Gabe. We have rejected the use of soft money in this campaign. My campaign has neither raised nor spent a dollar of soft money, which is a very different experience from my opponent, Mrs. Clinton's campaign. We could have easily decided to go down that road of trying to raise a lot of money in very large denominations, but decided against it. I have done a good deal of work in the House of Representatives. Of course I've been very active on housing issues, on helping the homeless, helping poor people with public housing, helping Native Americans. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- But have you gotten contributions, heavy contributions, from the housing industry?</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- We've gotten contributions from a whole range of people with different interests that are important to the quality of life of New Yorkers. Do New Yorkers care about the homeless? I believe they do. And that's why I've authored legislation to help them. Public-housing residents -- the most sweeping reform in public-housing history -- was authored by me and passed in the House and signed into law, which I'm proud to say.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Well, Gabe, let me perhaps enlighten you on his record, since he did not. He received a million dollars in contributions from the home-building industry and from the manufacturers of homes. And in return, at least there is an appearance that he did several things. He fought to weaken the safety standards for manufactured housing and in-home building.</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- True or false.</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- That's absolutely false. And you know it, Mrs. Clinton. Please do not make up things.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Well, Mr. Lazio, you just quoted -- you just referred to The Daily News, which ran an investigative article which made exactly that point. In addition ----</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- That is absolutely false.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Well, but it appears that ----</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Let me tell you something, Mrs. Clinton, in eight years -- there's one thing that I will not tolerate. And that's being dragged down into the mud. My reputation is impeccable. My integrity is impeccable. Never in my life has anybody accused me of doing a single thing because of who supported me. I am very proud of my record on housing. . . . There's been nobody else in the House of Representatives who's stood up for poor people and to provide them with good-quality housing. Now, are you going to complain about that? The fact that I've been there for the homeless, I've been there to provide housing for people with AIDS ----</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Well, it's ----</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- I've been there for Native American people, I've been there for people who rely on Section 8 . . . that I'm boosting homeownership for our young families.</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- O.K.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- In fact, I'll be meeting with a group of public-housing tenants this evening because what their memory of that fight was, Mr. Lazio, is that you were trying to remove the caps from the limits that would in some way prohibit a lot of people from being able to have the public housing that they needed because you were going to make it available to more people than just the very poorest of the poor. But let me just go back, Gabe ----</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- I'd be happy to talk about housing policy if you want.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- . . . for a minute. Because not only -- not only is there a problem with the home builders and the safety standards, but the F.H.A. was trying to increase the limits that would enable a person who wanted to be a homeowner to be able to borrow at low interest. And my opponent fought that. He did not want those limits raised and around the time of that fight he received significant contributions from the mortgage banking industry.</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- All right, let me ----</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- Do you understand that the standards that you're talking about were endorsed by the administration's Department of Housing and Urban Development? Do you understand that?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON -- Do you understand that the standards I'm talking about, that you were trying to weaken, were said by the AARP that they would have put people in danger?</p>
        <p>MR. PRESSMAN -- Alright.</p>
        <p>MR. LAZIO -- O.K. now, they've endorsed the bill. . . .</p>
