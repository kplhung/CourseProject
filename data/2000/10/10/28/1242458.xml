        <p>A New Jersey man suspected in the shooting deaths of a candy store patron in Union, N.J., on Monday and a Boy Scout in Virginia last month was himself shot to death early yesterday morning, officials said, by police officers who raided his mother's house about eight blocks from the store.</p>
        <p>The man, Naquan Supreme Perry, 20, may have been emotionally disturbed, the authorities said, having told his mother recently that he was going to kill himself or use a confrontation with the police to end his life. Neither of the killings in which he was a suspect involved robbery or any other known motive, the authorities said.</p>

        <p>A New Jersey man suspected in the shooting deaths of a candy store patron in Union, N.J., on Monday and a Boy Scout in Virginia last month was himself shot to death early yesterday morning, officials said, by police officers who raided his mother's house about eight blocks from the store.</p>
        <p>The man, Naquan Supreme Perry, 20, may have been emotionally disturbed, the authorities said, having told his mother recently that he was going to kill himself or use a confrontation with the police to end his life. Neither of the killings in which he was a suspect involved robbery or any other known motive, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>''By all accounts, even his family's, he was a rather disturbed individual,'' said Thomas V. Manahan, the Union County prosecutor, who spoke to reporters about the shooting at a news conference in Elizabeth, N.J. ''Mr. Perry used to carry his weapon with him at all times, and refer to it as his 'baby.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Manahan also said Mr. Perry's mother told investigators he was depressed over his lack of money.</p>
        <p>Several days before the candy store shooting, the sheriff's office in Loudoun County, Va., had received a tip that the suspect in the shooting there was living with his mother in New Jersey, but they lacked sufficient evidence to arrest him, said Greg C. Brown, an investigator from the sheriff's office.</p>
        <p>''We didn't have enough on him,'' Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>The raid took place just before 5 a.m. yesterday. Officials said 16 members of the Union County Emergency Response Team battered down the door of a house at 1157 Falls Terrace in Union Township, where Mr. Perry was staying with his mother, Barbara Chasten, and five other people.</p>
        <p>Officers wearing bulletproof vests immediately fanned out through the house, identifying themselves as the police, with several heading up the stairs and into the three second-floor bedrooms, including one that Mr. Perry was sharing with his 8-year-old half-sister, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perry, who had been in bed, fired a shot from his 9-millimeter handgun, hitting one of the officers' guns. The police returned fire, hitting Mr. Perry at least once in the chest, Mr. Manahan said. He said none of the officers or the girl were injured.</p>
        <p>The shooting on Monday left 60-year-old Henry Dahlmeyer dead and a friend, Michael Gorka, also 60, wounded in the face. Mr. Perry entered the store and asked the owner the price of a candy bar, officials said. Officials said Mr. Perry said he did not have the money, and when the owner turned away, Mr. Perry shot the two men, then fled.</p>
        <p>On the night of Sept. 15, officials said, Mr. Perry shot and killed Eric VanNederynen, 15, as the boy was walking to a supermarket near his home in Sterling, Va. Mr. Perry had briefly worked at the Countryside Mall in Sterling, where the victim also worked, and he knew the victim's brother.</p>
