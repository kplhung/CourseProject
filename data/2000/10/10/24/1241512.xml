        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Not to my surprise, the Personal Health column indicated that suburban residents walk less, bike less and are physically less fit than city dwellers (''Planning Healthier Suburbs, Where Cares Sit Idle and People Get Moving,'' Oct. 17).</p>
        <p>Eighteen months ago, I moved from the Netherlands to work and I now live in Westchester County. I have not driven a car since. Instead, I own a sturdy mountain bike that I take wherever I can, and for faraway destinations I use public transportation.</p>
        <p>People think it is hilarious when I tell them stories of my trips to the grocery store, as it always involves cars that almost run me over, unnecessary comments at stop signs from these same drivers and cashiers who do not understand that they don't have to bag my groceries because I will put them in my backpack.</p>
        <p>Residents here believe that the only way to get anywhere beyond their driveway is by one of their S.U.V.'s.</p>
        <p>I am flabbergasted by this attitude because Americans seem so obsessed with exercise, health and diet.</p>
