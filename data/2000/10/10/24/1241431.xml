        <p>The General Electric Company's proposed $45 billion purchase of Honeywell International has been widely promoted as the last hurrah of G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch Jr. But it may ultimately be remembered for cementing a dominant position for G.E. in the global aviation business.</p>
        <p>G.E. is already one of the major manufacturers of passenger jet engines and its finance division leases hundreds of airplanes to the world's airlines. Honeywell's $10.5 billion portfolio of aerospace businesses will double aviation-related revenue at G.E., raising it to nearly 15 percent of the $130 billion overall sales of the combined companies.</p>
        <p>More importantly, Honeywell would extend G.E.'s reach beyond large engines to a host of critical aircraft components like navigation systems, generators and landing gear. G.E.'s engine division already pioneered the packaging of engines with services and financing to increase sales and profits. Now it could get another leg up on its competitors by extending the model even further using Honeywell's products, analysts and aerospace executives said yesterday.</p>
        <p>''What all the aerospace companies want to do is go from subsystems providers to selling solutions,'' said Brian Kanter, the head of the aerospace and military practice for the Americas at Deloitte &amp; Touche. ''G.E. figured this out 10 years ago and everybody is trying to figure it out now.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, some executives were so bullish about G.E.'s prospects that they said it could steal profits from Boeing and Airbus Industrie, the two big commercial jet manufacturers.</p>
        <p>One Wall Street analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said a Honeywell customer told him: ''I think G.E. just bought Boeing and Boeing doesn't know it yet.''</p>
        <p>For years, aerospace components makers have joked that airplanes are simply tubes of aluminum on which to hang their products. The profit margins of both G.E. engines and Honeywell's aerospace operations are more than twice those of Boeing's commercial airplane division. The combination of G.E. and Honeywell could siphon even more of the value away from Boeing.</p>
        <p>''Honeywell sold things to Boeing, which Boeing sold to the airlines,'' the analyst said. ''G.E. may say, 'Now we are going to change the rules here.' ''</p>
        <p>Using G.E. as a model, Boeing has recently embarked on a shopping spree, expanding into services like aircraft maintenance and the conversion of passenger jets into freighters. Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chief executive, said through a spokesman yesterday that he saw no threat to Boeing's future profits from the G.E.-Honeywell deal.</p>
        <p>Of course, the combination of G.E. and Honeywell, like many large mergers, could also founder, causing Mr. Welch to rue the day he stole Honeywell out of the arms of a rival suitor, United Technologies, and delayed his retirement. G.E. is expert at merging small companies but it has not taken a bite as big as Honeywell since its purchase of RCA in the mid-1980's.</p>
        <p>But few people in the aerospace industry are betting against the company. ''G.E. has 10 different ways to disguise the way they are making money,'' said one aerospace consultant, who insisted on anonymity.</p>
        <p>He said that GE Capital can lease a jet for a below-market rate but make up the difference and then some on a so-called power-by-the-hour deal in which G.E. provides airlines with engines for a flat hourly fee while taking care of all the maintenance.</p>
        <p>G.E. displayed its prowess last year when Boeing named it as the sole engine supplier for its new long-range 777 over United Technologies' Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce P.L.C. G.E. had invested more than $1.5 billion earlier in the decade to develop a new engine for the 777 but sold fewer than its competitors.</p>
        <p>As sole supplier for the two new 777 models, G.E. would ensure that it would be supplying spare parts and services for its large engine for years to come. To seal the deal, G.E. dipped into huge cash horde and agreed to help Boeing fund the development of the new jets, something its competitors were not willing, or able, to do.</p>
        <p>G.E. could also bolster profits by cutting costs. It plans to integrate Honeywell into its ambitious e-commerce initiatives. Among other things, G.E. has created personalized home pages for each of its airline customers, enabling them to check the status of their engines from computer screens and even buy multimillion-dollar jet engines online.</p>
        <p>Finally, by buying Honeywell G.E. kept it out of the hands of United Technologies, leaving that company's carefully laid plans in tatters. George David, United Technologies'  chief executive, put a brave face on the loss, saying that the company would pursue other deals. But one airline executive who spoke on condition of anonymity was not convinced.</p>
        <p>''The matchup of U.T.C. and Honeywell would have made U.T.C. much stronger,'' he said. ''This is going to make them much weaker.''</p>
