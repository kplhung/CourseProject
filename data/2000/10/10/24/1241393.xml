        <p>SHADOWS OF A PRINCESS  An Intimate Account by Her Private Secretary  By P. D. Jephson  Illustrated. 456 pages. HarperCollins. $26.</p>

        <p>When has the art of the celebrity tattletale enjoyed balmier times? Taking notes on the trespasses of anybody famous has become a sure-fire way to borrow glory and sell a lot of books in the bargain. But the Rosencrantzes and Guildensterns who thus emerge as authors have their own set of standards to meet. Even when wallowing in the deepest dish, the reader is bound to wonder exactly who orchestrated this character assassination. And why.</p>
        <p>In the case of P. D. Jephson, the traitorous and long-winded former private secretary to Princess Diana, those questions are much too easily answered. Mr. Jephson, in a preposterously overlong and stultifying account of his brush with the limelight, tells much more about himself than anyone need know. From his own vantage point as royalty wrangler and traveling bureaucrat, he describes what it was like to have Mother Teresa's number in his phone book, to visit Pakistan and Zimbabwe on official business, to keep track of the gold watches the Princess bestowed on various diplomats and to arrange restroom stops on short notice.</p>
        <p>With vastly unbecoming snobbery, Mr. Jephson writes patronizingly about his employer, stopping frequently to regret her failure to heed his own wise counsel. ''Despite my fine ideas,'' he tells us, ''her continuing lack of a coherent personal strategy, plus her readiness to be easily swayed by a fashionable opinion one minute and obdurately stubborn for no logical reason the next, made it difficult for me to plan a strategy for her public life.''</p>
        <p>That difficulty was heightened by Mr. Jephson's bitterness and resentment, which he shared with other members of the royal staff, that ''regardless of outward appearances, words could hardly describe the depth of our employers' indifference to us as people.'' The various freebies, perks and potables that he fondly describes here seem only to have exacerbated his disgruntlement as a highly-placed hanger-on.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, it might be worthwhile to overlook the sourness of these grapes if Mr. Jephson had anything interesting to tell. But all he offers, beyond an inside look at institutionalized sycophancy, is proof that he has read the same tabloids that you have and can thus report ancient news about the Princess's interests in astrology, colonic irrigation or taking her sons to McDonald's to acquaint them with ordinary life. Lacking much more data than that, he nonetheless manages hundreds of pages worth of stultifying, lifeless prose. For instance: ''However gratifying it may have been to her sense of victimhood, any view in which detached logic played a part -- and this, to be fair, was not her strong point -- would have shown her that all efforts I and others might make to reinforce her image as an independent but still royal operator was now ultimately bound to fail.''</p>
        <p>Though Tina Sinatra's book about her father has a contrastingly generic, ghostwritten sound, right down to neat foreshadowing of the little-did-I-know variety that punctuates many a passage, it packs a no-nonsense punch. The author has scores to settle, and she trains her Howitzers on her final stepmother, Barbara Marx Sinatra, whom she characterizes as a gold-digging former Las Vegas showgirl, ''Horatio Alger in a headdress.'' Ms. Sinatra would like readers to share her wonderment at the fact that her father once wrote his will on a Friday and then signed a new version the following Tuesday, a legal adjustment that she says worked to Barbara Sinatra's advantage by several million dollars. She also expects sympathy in a fight over a kilo of caviar that Tina's friends consumed at Frank and Barbara's house, allegedly for fear it would otherwise spoil.</p>
        <p>But there is more to her story than pettiness or perks. Ms. Sinatra's book describes the poignantly strange circumstance of having a father more available on radio or television than in person, of knowing that his cronies called him ''Chicky Baby'' and of seeing Ol' Blue Eyes himself, sporting his Cavanaugh fedora and driving his silver Thunderbird convertible, arriving to visit his children when he could tear himself away from Ava Gardner. In a book that takes only a fleeting swipe at Kitty Kelley's less flattering portrait of Sinatra, his daughter thinks of him as ''just the loneliest, most guileless man in the world'' and touchingly describes what it meant to lose him.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sinatra maintains that her parents sustained a close, even conjugal friendship long after their divorce and that the interloping Barbara destroyed a content, if dysfunctional, family. Though she has little of interest to offer about her early years, the author energetically comes to life when it is time to describe, say, her father's move to annul her parents' marriage at Barbara's behest. ''I was as gleeful as a Munchkin after the house fell on Margaret Hamilton's sister,'' she reports about Frank's brief separation from Barbara, but in fact the marriage lasted for the rest of the singer's life. Still, Tina vowed, 'I would be the family's Jack Russell terrier; I'd get hold of Dad's leg and would not let go.''</p>
        <p>Eventually Sinatra fell victim to forces even more unstoppable than any of the women in his life. But long after depression, failing memory and increasing physical frailties began taking their toll, Ms. Sinatra maintains, he continued performing publicly under fiscal pressure from his wife. ''It was like watching a puppy suffer,'' the author writes of seeing him on a stage that way. Her genuine-sounding loyalty and longing give the latter part of this book a powerful legitimacy. She knows the grief of watching a loved one slip away.</p>
