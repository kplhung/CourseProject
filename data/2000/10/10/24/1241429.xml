        <p>As budget negotiations continued today between Nassau County officials and members of a state board monitoring the county's fiscal crisis, Democratic lawmakers withdrew their support for a plan to eliminate millions of dollars in aid to the county's three towns and two cities.</p>
        <p>The Democrats reversed their stance on the plan, proposed last month by County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, to withhold  all $50 million in county sales tax revenue that Nassau now passes on to the five other municipalities, starting in 2003.</p>
        <p>Legislative leaders -- both Republican and Democrat -- said they feared Mr. Gulotta's proposal would transfer the county's budget problems to the next level of government.</p>
        <p>''We knew there was not support for it on any level of government,'' said Judith A. Jacobs, the Democratic presiding officer in the County Legislature. ''The effect of stopping this would be so detrimental to the cities and towns.''</p>
        <p>But in their budget plans released last week, the Democrats supported the initiative -- although they proposed postponing the cutoff until 2004. Today, after reversing themselves again, Democrats also said their budget called for distributing an additional $250,000 in sales tax revenue to the county's 64 villages.</p>
        <p>But in doing so, the Democrats would add to a budget deficit expected to grow to nearly $380 million by 2004. To help balance the books, last week they proposed a 16.3 percent increase in the county portion of the property tax next year to raise $95 million. Republican lawmakers countered with a call for a 5 percent raise in those taxes. Mr. Gulotta had proposed a 4 percent increase.</p>
        <p>Today, the three county leaders -- Mr. Gulotta, Ms. Jacobs and Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader -- met with officials from the state board, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, to see if they could reach some consensus.</p>
        <p>Robert W. Lazaro, a spokesman for Mr. Schmitt, said the Republicans would not discuss the negotiations with the state board in public but said they embraced the Democrats' plan to maintain revenue sharing with the towns and cities.</p>
