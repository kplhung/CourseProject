        <p>Because of a broad new study, federal health officials have endorsed long-term use of corticosteroid inhalers for children with asthma.</p>
        <p>In a study published this month in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers with the Childhood Asthma Management Program said the drugs were effective and safe. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute financed the study.</p>
        <p>The conclusions followed a five-year study of 1,000 children from 5 to 12 at eight places around the country. It was described as the longest, largest controlled study of childhood asthma treatments.</p>
        <p>Children in the study were asked to inhale corticosteroids, nonsteroidal medications or a placebo. Across the board, the study said, the steroids had the best effect. Children taking them had 45 percent fewer urgent-care visits, 43 percent fewer hospitalizations and 22 percent more days without an episode of asthma. The drug did not improve overall lung function.</p>
        <p>The only side effect was reduction in the child's growth rate in the first year of use, but it was slight and temporary.</p>
