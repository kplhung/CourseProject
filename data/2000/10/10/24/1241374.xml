        <p>A 21-year-old dancer pushed her face into a pillow last spring as a needle probed one disk and then another in her lower back in a chilly radiology suite. Less than a teaspoon of dye oozed from the needle into the first disk, showing up on an X-ray as a dark puddle within the lighter disk. The needle slipped into the next spot, and again the dye pooled dark inside the disk.</p>
        <p>With the third injection, the dye flowed into the disk and started dribbling out through a tear. The patient cried out and clenched her fists as the seeping dye irritated the already angry nerve endings at the breach. So Dr. Gregory E. Lutz, a physiatrist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, halted the test, called a diskogram, convinced that he had found the tear that had been causing the dancer lower-back pain for two years.</p>
        <p>As a physiatrist -- a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist -- Dr. Lutz prefers conservative treatment: rest, braces, anti-inflammatory injections, physical therapy. But he knew that those measures had failed to relieve the dancer's pain. He could have persisted with that strategy or recommended spinal fusion, a major operation in which the surgeon removes the parts of the disk that are torn or degenerated and fuses bone to stabilize the trouble spot.</p>
        <p>Neither choice was appealing, but Dr. Lutz could offer his patient another option: intradiskal electrothermal therapy, a minor procedure in which an injection is made into the disk and a catheter is inserted and heated to seal the breach, presumably killing the nerve endings carrying pain signals from the site as well.</p>
        <p>If the disk is torn, said Dr. Jeffrey A. Saal, who developed the procedure with his brother, Dr. Joel S. Saal, ''it's as if you had a cut on the back of your hand and it never scabbed over and remained open.'' The heat from the catheter seals the site, he said. The Saal brothers practice in Menlo Park, Calif.; the company they helped found, Oratec Interventions Inc., sells equipment for the procedure and trains doctors to do it.</p>
        <p>A patient walks out of the hospital an hour or two after the procedure, known as IDET (pronounced EYE-det), is performed under local anesthesia, and takes it easy for a few months; some go to work the next day. (A spinal fusion can keep someone out of work for months.)</p>
        <p>Dr. Lutz has done the procedure on nearly 100 patients, he said, and 60 to 65 percent have been able to lead more active lives. For the rest, fusion remains an option.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lutz said, ''It will be a tremendous success story if doctors can do this instead of fusions for degenerative disk disease.''</p>
        <p>The procedure has been performed on more than 20,000 patients worldwide by nearly 2,500 doctors since it started being used more than three years ago, and it looks promising in many studies. But it is designed to help only a particular type of lower back pain, and results are not yet available from controlled, double-blind studies.</p>
        <p>''Until the jury is back in on this thing,'' said Dr. Edward N. Hanley, orthopedics department chairman at the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, ''one has to be very skeptical. The track record would lead us to believe that this is one of a series of fads and fashions utilized to treat back pain.''</p>
        <p>But at the same time, Dr. Hanley said he would ''be a believer'' if the trials now under way came up with good results.</p>
        <p>Many people are looking for ways to relieve back pain. At least two-thirds, and perhaps three-quarters, of all Americans will suffer back pain at least once, medical groups estimate. While most people need only conservative treatments, the American College of Rheumatology says, 4 percent of the Americans with back pain have lingering problems. They account for 85 percent of the $16 billion that lower-back problems cost the nation each year.</p>
        <p>Perhaps a third to a half of the people with chronic pain could be candidates for intradiskal therapy, its proponents say. The procedure is for those who suffer primarily back pain, not the leg pain that occurs when a protrusion like a bulging disk presses onto the sciatic nerve. It is intended for chronic sufferers whose pain comes from disks with tears or degenerated areas, and those who do not have large disk bulges.</p>
        <p>That may sound straightforward, but it is often not easy to figure out why someone's back hurts -- or why it stops hurting. One patient may feel no pain from disk problems that look ominous in CAT scans and M.R.I. images, while another suffers a great deal as tests come back with normal or nearly normal results. It is an area of medicine in which success often means reducing pain to the point that patients can bear the strength and flexibility exercises that can help them move more easily, not achieving freedom from pain.</p>
        <p>That is why, proponents of the therapy say, it is important that a patient have a diskography before trying intradiskal therapy. When seeping dye brings on the same kind of pain the patient has been coping with, the doctor can be reasonably sure that a disk is a part of the problem.</p>
        <p>The dancer with the torn disk had IDET this summer, Dr. Lutz said, and is ''definitely better.'' She hopes to be able to resume her career. For patients like her, with torn disks but no other major disk degeneration, Dr. Lutz's success rate is 75 percent to 80 percent, he said.</p>
        <p>Whether IDET becomes a standard treatment will depend on studies like a multicenter trial that is being run by Dr. F. Todd Wetzel, an orthopedic surgeon who is medical director at the University of Chicago Spine Center. The study involves 74 patients; 38 of them had the therapy at least two years ago, and more than 70 percent of the patients say the procedure helped them, Dr. Wetzel said in an interview.</p>
        <p>''Since I'm not one of the developers of the technique and brought a skeptical bias to the study,'' Dr. Wetzel said, ''I think our data have been well received. They show fairly high patient satisfaction.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Wetzel and his colleagues will present positive data about IDET at the North American Spine Society's annual meeting, which begins tomorrow in New Orleans, as will other researchers.</p>
        <p>For patients with intractable lower-back pain linked to deteriorating disks, IDET could well fill a therapeutic gap, Dr. Wetzel said. ''Now, we've essentially got a fly swatter and an elephant gun, and not much in between,'' Dr. Wetzel said.</p>
        <p>Questions about the new therapy may be settled in many doctors' minds by the first double-blind IDET clinical trial, which will include 75 patients. The study's director, Dr. Robert D. Fraser, a professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Adelaide in Australia, said the study would have all its participants next January and would be completed in July 2001.</p>
        <p>''Quite frankly,'' Dr. Wetzel said, ''Dr. Fraser's study will be absolutely critical.''</p>
        <p>Another double-blind study is just beginning in Tyler, Tex. That study is by Dr. Kevin Pauza at the East Texas Medical Center Neurological Institute.</p>
        <p>If it turns out to be effective over the long term, intradiskal therapy will be a lower-cost alternative to fusion surgery for some kinds of disk problems. An IDET treatment runs about $5,000 to $8,000, while fusion may cost more than $40,000.</p>
        <p>The question is whether it is effective and safe. Until the procedure is proved, many insurance companies will consider it experimental and refuse to pay for treatments.</p>
        <p>One major question about IDET's long-term safety focuses on what happens to the internal structure of the disk over time. Just as applying heat to an egg white tangles its proteins and makes it more solid, applying heat to a disk's outer covering changes the structure of its collagen protein. So it is still a question as to whether a disk that has been sealed by heat will act as an effective shock absorber for the spine.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lutz and others have done safety studies that have been reassuring. But only long-term research can resolve the questions of what happens to the heat-treated collagen and whether nerve endings will grow back and cause more problems.</p>
        <p>How well IDET patients do over time will determine if the initial enthusiasm by many doctors is justified. Many patients say they are glad that they had the procedure.</p>
        <p>One of them is Diane Pearce, an administrative assistant to the associate provost at Princeton. By the time Ms. Pearce, 58, saw Dr. Lutz, she had tried one treatment after another.</p>
        <p>''I had no life,'' she said. ''I'd go home from work and lie down. I couldn't go to the movies or a restaurant. The longer I sat, it would keep getting worse.''</p>
        <p>In March 1999, Dr. Lutz performed one procedure on one of Ms. Pearce's disks, and then he did another on a second disk in September 1999.</p>
        <p>Last April, she felt well enough for her first outing with friends in three years.</p>
        <p>''We took a bus to New York and went to Duffy Square,'' she said. ''I saw 'Kiss Me Kate' and took the bus home. I wanted to kiss Dr. Lutz.''</p>
        <p>That doesn't mean she's ready to go back to tennis and aerobics. She still finds it hard to sit for long periods and cannot do much lifting. But she can walk two miles, and she hopes that next year she'll be able to take a plane trip.</p>
        <p>''I have stiffness,'' she said. ''But the pain is gone.''</p>
