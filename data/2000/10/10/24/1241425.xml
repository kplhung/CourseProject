        <p>Ron Low, stationed at the blue line with his whistle in his hand, suddenly began to chomp his chewing gum with a fury, and he elevated his voice so that it rattled off the rafters of the old Playland rink.</p>
        <p>Low, the Rangers' coach, had told his players to work on a forechecking drill this afternoon, and he wanted them to push the puck up the ice in a hurry and to keep it there. An urgent hockey team forechecks well, and the Rangers have not been forechecking or playing with as much urgency as Low wants.</p>
        <p>To help make his point clear, Low has begun to juggle his lines just six games into the regular season, and not even a familiar pairing was too sacred to break up. Adam Graves, who has been Mark Messier's left wing in both of Messier's tours with the Rangers, has been dropped to the third line for Tuesday's home game against the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
        <p>''A lot of things are subject to change,'' Low said.</p>
        <p>Low also said today that the struggling left wing Michal Grosek would be in the stands for the game. The coach wants to see his team play with more passion, particularly at home, where the Rangers will play four times in the next nine days. They visit the struggling Flyers on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The Rangers (3-3-0-0) are 1-2 at the Garden this year. On Sunday they lost to Tampa Bay, which had been routed by the host Devils a night earlier. ''Sometimes, you wonder if when we're playing at home that we're not the most nervous people you've ever seen,'' Low said.</p>
        <p>Rangers goaltender Mike Richter, who played his first game of the season on Sunday, will probably not play Tuesday. Richter said this afternoon that his surgically repaired left knee felt fine after the game and today's 90-minute practice, but Low does not want to play Richter too much too soon. So Kirk McLean will probably start in goal Tuesday, with Richter returning to the net on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''You can't just gut it out with something like this and say, 'More is better,' '' Richter said.</p>
        <p>Low said that Graves, 32, who has just one goal and has only taken eight shots this season, would drop to the line that includes center Mike York and right wing John McLean. Valery Kamensky will be Messier's new left wing, with Theo Fleury skating on the other wing.</p>
        <p>Besides Messier, York has been the Rangers' best forward this season, said Low, who suggested that Graves, who scored 15 fewer goals last season (23) than he did the year before, may be looking too hard for a spark.</p>
        <p>''Maybe if he's not with Mark, he won't be looking as hard for it,'' Low said.</p>
        <p>Grosek will be scratched, Low said, because it appears as if he has no confidence. In six games, Grosek has a minus-3 rating and 12 penalty minutes. Grosek said today that he is confused by the National Hockey League's tougher stance on hitting from behind and on stick fouls.</p>
        <p>''You have to go into a corner and think about what you're doing,'' Grosek said. ''You have to be careful now.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers, who have not had a winning record at home in three seasons,  have become used to seeing other teams come into the Garden and playing with reckless intensity. This can be a time to change that. ''Everybody wants to win, and everybody's excited to play in the Garden,'' Messier said. ''That doesn't mean it has to be negative for us.''</p>
