        <p>Choice Hotels International, a hotel franchiser for brands like Comfort, Quality and Econo Lodge, is beginning a review for its consumer advertising account. Billings were estimated at $35 million to $40 million. The account has been at Gray, Kirk/VanSant in Baltimore for about 20 years.</p>
        <p>The review was precipitated by last month's arrival of a new senior vice president for marketing at Choice, Wayne Wielgus, from Best Western International. where he had been vice president for global marketing. John Hawkins, a spokesman at Choice in Silver Spring, Md., said the company had not decided whether or not Gray, Kirk/VanSant would be invited to participate in the review. A decision on an agency is planned for January or February.</p>
