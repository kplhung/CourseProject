        <p>Republicans here say the liberalism of Lane Evans, the Democratic congressman who has represented the district for 18 years, scarcely fits this farm-and-factory region of northwestern Illinois.</p>
        <p>It is a claim they have made for nine elections and are pressing again this year as Mr. Evans seeks a 10th term. As in the last two races, they have nominated Mark Baker, a former television newscaster, in hopes of unseating the congressman and helping to confound Democratic efforts to wrest control of the House.</p>

        <p>Republicans here say the liberalism of Lane Evans, the Democratic congressman who has represented the district for 18 years, scarcely fits this farm-and-factory region of northwestern Illinois.</p>
        <p>It is a claim they have made for nine elections and are pressing again this year as Mr. Evans seeks a 10th term. As in the last two races, they have nominated Mark Baker, a former television newscaster, in hopes of unseating the congressman and helping to confound Democratic efforts to wrest control of the House.</p>
        <p>''This district looks like it ought to be a tossup,'' said Jim Winship, a political science professor at Augustana College here. ''But the Republicans have just not been able to crack it.''</p>
        <p>The Rock Island-Moline area, home to the tractor maker Deere &amp; Company, was once known as the Detroit of the Farm Belt, a center of good-paying assembly-line jobs protected by strong unions, especially the United Automobile Workers.  That blue-collar foundation remains  the source of the Democratic strength here in the 17th Congressional District, although the number of U.A.W. jobs has been declining since the mid 1980's, when a big International Harvester plant shut down and other agricultural equipment makers, including Deere, were hit hard by the farm recession.</p>
        <p>The Republican hopes lie in the district's small towns and rural stretches and in the more affluent parts of East Moline, home to many of the area's white-collar workers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker, the Republican challenger, has sought to highlight social issues, noting Mr. Evans's support for abortion rights and gay rights and his opposition to a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to ban flag-burning.</p>
        <p>''Those just aren't the value systems in western Illinois,'' Mr. Baker said as he greeted factory workers in the small city of Sterling. ''And that's what's going to bring him down.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Evans replies that after 18 years in Congress, he is familiar to the voters.</p>
        <p>''If it were true,'' he said of the accusation that he is too liberal for his constituents, ''it would have caused me to lose my job.''</p>
        <p>The son of two Rock Islanders -- a firefighter and a nurse -- Mr. Evans said he needed no lectures about the district's mores. ''I'm born and raised here,'' he said. ''I know the values of people here.''</p>
        <p>In fact, this is not a district that has historically been driven by sharply conservative views, even among Republicans. The last Republican to represent it was Thomas F.  Railsback, a moderate who as a member of the House Judiciary Committee voted to recommend the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon.</p>
        <p>In any event, there is little confusion about where the candidates stand, judging from two dozen interviews on the sidewalks of the district.</p>
        <p>To Don Walker, a 53-year-old construction worker, Mr. Evans deserves support because he has been loyal to unions.</p>
        <p>''He sides with the working people,'' Mr. Walker said as he filled his pickup truck with gasoline. ''Wages are definitely up. Everybody who wants to work is working.''</p>
        <p>But to Phil Rocker, a 72-year-old farmer, Mr. Evans's support for  unions is a bit too automatic.</p>
        <p>''He's 100 percent for the unions, no matter what the issue is,'' Mr. Rocker said. ''I don't have anything against Evans as a person. It's just that he's so liberal, and I tend to be a little more on the conservative side.''</p>
        <p>But much of the talk in this campaign has centered on entirely local issues like the odors emanating from waste lagoons at huge hog-confinement operations, and the debate on whether to build another bridge over the Mississippi River.</p>
        <p>''The economy has come back a lot from the hard times of the 80's,'' Professor Winship said. ''It's a much more diversified region than it used to be. And riverboat gambling has provided a lot of jobs.''</p>
        <p>The district is more than 94 percent white, and its population nearly 40 percent rural. In the last two presidential elections, the voters here sided with Bill Clinton, who defeated Bob Dole by 13 points in 1996. The last two Congressional races have been much closer, with Mr. Evans winning 52 percent of the vote against Mr. Baker in each.</p>
        <p>A peripheral issue in the race this year has been the health of Mr. Evans, who has Parkinson's disease. Evans backers say Mr. Baker's frequent references to his own high level of energy is a not-so-subtle reminder to voters of the congressman's condition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Evans has run advertisements talking about his case of Parkinson's, which he says does not interfere with his duties but does make him more understanding of the challenges faced by people with illnesses.</p>
        <p>To a voter like Debbie Schweska, Mr. Evans's condition makes him even more appealing, as a politician who understands the difficulties of the underdog.</p>
        <p>''You've got these Republicans who are harping about the marriage tax,'' said Ms. Schweska, who works in a convenience store. ''Give me a break. Let's talk about the people who are really struggling, like the moms on welfare who don't get a nickel in child support.''</p>
