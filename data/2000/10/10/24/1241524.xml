        <p>The medicine continues to be bitter at Drugstore.com. On Friday, the company said it was laying off 60 employees, some 10 percent of its work force. Yesterday, the company said it had scaled back its marketing and other spending plans for next year to preserve its cash. The company also released its third-quarter results yesterday, reporting a loss of $33.3 million, or 58 cents a share. That was better than the 64 cents a share that analysts had expected. Sales for the quarter rose to $26.5 million, from $12.2 million last year.</p>
