        <p>FRANCE: MAD COW CONCERN -- Concern about the spread of mad cow disease has been growing as the number of new cases recorded this year has more than doubled since last year. Authorities announced over the weekend that 1,000 tons of potentially contaminated meat had been put on the market as of Oct. 10. The Carrefour supermarket chain said the meat was distributed to 39 stores, mostly in northern France. The latest case brought to 73 the number of affected animals found in 2000, compared with 31 in 1999.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: LE PEN BARRED -- The far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen was stripped of his role as a deputy in the European Parliament after a French court upheld a sentence excluding him from holding public office for a year for assaulting a rival politician. ''I think that it is a major injustice,'' Mr. Le Pen told the Parliament. He was convicted in April 1998 of assaulting a Socialist candidate, Annette Peulvast-Bergeal, during campaigning for national elections in 1997.</p>

        <p>NETHERLANDS: NEW LOCKERBIE INFORMATION -- The Lockerbie trial convened for a 15-minute session in which prosecutors gave the defense a stack of documents described as ''complex and sensitive.'' The new delay was to give the defense time to review the information, which has led the Scottish police to interview six people, five in Europe and one in the United States. The chief prosecutor has maintained a shroud of secrecy over the information.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: SLAYING PROTESTED -- Thousands marched around the country calling for the Basque separatist group E.T.A. to stop their killings, the day after it was accused of the slaying of a prison official, Maximo Casado Carrera, 44, with a bomb placed under his car. At noon people gathered outside their work places in a five-minute silent protest against the killing, the 16th tied to the E.T.A. this year.</p>

The court is expected to decide the case in about two weeks.</p>

        <p>CANADA: PREMIER CHARGED -- A former premier of British Columbia has been charged with fraud and breach of trust for helping a friend get a casino license. Glen Clark, who resigned last year, has maintained his innocence.

        <p>CUBA: PHONE CALL TAX -- Havana, retaliating against a bill in the United States Congress that makes use of Cuban money frozen in the United States, levied a 10 percent tax on the cost of telephone calls between Cuba and the United States.

        <p>IRAN: WEEKLY PAPER CLOSED -- The hard-line judiciary has ordered a small weekly newspaper to stop publishing and has warned that more closings are to come, according to news media reports. The reasons for closing Sobh-e-Omid were not made clear, but hard-liners opposed to reforms by President Mohammad Khatami have shut down more than two dozen pro-democracy publications in recent months. The chief of the Tehran Justice Administration was quoted as saying that ''several other papers'' had also been ordered to close.</p>
