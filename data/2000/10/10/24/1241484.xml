        <p>His eyes were sleepy, his words were deliberate and his mannerisms were listless. Joe Torre did not really look like a manager whose team had grabbed the first two games of the World Series as he shifted behind a lectern at Shea Stadium. Torre looked like someone who was delivering the dreary news about how a business that supports most of the residents in a town was closing.</p>
        <p>One day after Roger Clemens whipped the jagged barrel of the bat in Mike Piazza's path in the Yankees' emotional 6-5 victory over the Mets in Game 2, Torre changed from being volcanic and animated in his support of Clemens to being docile and a bit contrite about the scary situation.</p>
        <p>Torre explained that he did not condone Clemens's action, but he defended Clemens by saying he did not believe the pitcher was intentionally throwing the bat at Piazza. Unlike Sunday, when a perturbed Torre started to walk away from an interview session when reporters asked about Clemens, he patiently answered questions about a topic the Yankees wish would vanish.</p>
        <p>But it will not disappear. The television replay of Clemens firing a hunk of wood at Piazza, even if the pitcher claimed that he thought it was the ball, will persist. The questions from reporters will continue. Torre knows that.</p>
        <p>Since Torre took over as manager of the Yankees in 1996, the Yankees have been viewed as a classy organization. There are many officials who helped shape the Yankees into a team that has won three of the last four World Series titles, but Torre has always been the most obvious focal point.</p>
        <p>He manages from the dugout so calmly, he cajoles the players so smoothly and he handles the owner so deftly. Torre's Yankees meant a team that everyone could respect. That position has been jeopardized because of what Clemens has done.</p>
        <p>''I hope not, but my loyalties are to the Yankees,'' Torre said. ''Again, I made the analogy that you have children and you may not be happy with some of their decisions or the things they do, but you're not going to chase them and make them live somewhere else. You can't pick and choose what part of the person you want to keep, and what part you don't want to keep.''</p>
        <p>Torre said he had a ''tough time'' after the game and went to a late dinner with his wife, Ali. He conceded that one of her first questions was ''Why would you throw a bat?'' So Torre explained why he did not believe Clemens intended to hit Piazza, and then told her about his eruption. Torre told his wife that Clemens had reacted ''out of emotion.''</p>
        <p>Torre is not going to punish Clemens. The manager said he had not even spoken with Clemens about the incident because he did not need an explanation.</p>
        <p>''I understand why he did it, even though you're saying 'Oh, no' when he does it,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Several Mets said they understood why Torre strongly defended Clemens, explaining that that was all a manager could do. Especially a manager who said Clemens was considered a ''wimp'' during his inconsistent times with the Yankees and a manager who knows Clemens is at his best when he is ornery.</p>
        <p>''If you really need a person, you don't want to put him down,'' Lenny Harris said. ''He's going to rip Clemens, but then he is going to need him in Game 6? Then what good is he?''</p>
        <p>But what if the bat had clipped Piazza?</p>
        <p>''I don't condone what he did,'' Torre said. ''But, again, I still hold the fact that he didn't throw at him, O.K.?'' Torre conceded that ''we're going to go overboard'' to protect Clemens because he is ''wearing our uniform.''</p>
        <p>The last time Torre figured he had been as angry was while he was managing the Mets in 1978. Dave Parker barreled over the Mets' John Stearns in a forceful play at the plate and Torre hustled onto the field in a rage. Both benches emptied and Bobby Valentine, who was on the Mets, recalled how the scene was intense until Torre smashed a bat and shattered it.</p>
        <p>''When he did that,'' Valentine said, ''everyone stopped.''</p>
        <p>Torre did not do anything so animated during Sunday night's game, but he was enraged after the game when Clemens's behavior was questioned. Torre returned to being mild mannered yesterday. A reporter remarked how Torre seemed like he was at a funeral; the moderator who repeats questions during interview sessions ignored that part of the question.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad you left the funeral part out,'' said Torre, drawing laughter from more than 100 reporters but no smile from him. Yesterday, a manager who was two victories away from his third straight championship was not smiling.</p>
