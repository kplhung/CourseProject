        <p>The political party that has governed Mexico for seven decades claimed victory in an important governor's race in the state of Tabasco today after a hotly disputed weeklong recount that ended in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>But the opposition says there has been fraud, and the victory may be a mixed blessing for the man who wants to lead the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which lost the presidential election in July, back to power: Roberto Madrazo, the outgoing governor of Tabasco. His handpicked successor, Manuel Andrade, was awarded victory by the state election commission by precisely 8,001 votes, slightly more than 1 percent of the ballots cast. A national election monitoring group, Civil Alliance, reported fraud and irregularities in more than 200 of the 2,110 polling places.</p>

        <p>The political party that has governed Mexico for seven decades claimed victory in an important governor's race in the state of Tabasco today after a hotly disputed weeklong recount that ended in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>But the opposition says there has been fraud, and the victory may be a mixed blessing for the man who wants to lead the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which lost the presidential election in July, back to power: Roberto Madrazo, the outgoing governor of Tabasco. His handpicked successor, Manuel Andrade, was awarded victory by the state election commission by precisely 8,001 votes, slightly more than 1 percent of the ballots cast. A national election monitoring group, Civil Alliance, reported fraud and irregularities in more than 200 of the 2,110 polling places.</p>
        <p>In Tabasco, the opposition -- the right-of-center National Action party and the left-of-center Democratic Revolutionary party -- protested the recount, saying the electoral commission was controlled by Mr. Madrazo's minions. ''Count it right!'' demonstrators shouted after the recount repeated the initially reported results.</p>
        <p>Mr. Madrazo is seeking to head his party, known as the PRI, which in July lost the presidency for the first time since 1929 to an opposition candidate, Vicente Fox Quesada, who takes office on Dec. 1. The thin margin of victory in Tabasco and the allegations of fraud did little to quell a simmering conflict in the party, reeling since the defeat of its presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>''The fragmentation of the party looks dreadful for Madrazo, a man who pledges to unify the party,'' said Frederico Estevez, a political scientist in Mexico City. ''Right now, he doesn't look like a unifier, not by a long shot. He thought he had his fiefdom under control. Turns out he didn't.''</p>
        <p>The PRI is down but by no means out. It still holds slight majorities in both houses of Congress, 19 of the 31 governors' posts and two-thirds of the local legislatures. But without the presidency, the party is an engine without fuel. The voters who embody Mexico's future -- the young, the educated, the skilled and the middle-class -- deserted it in July.</p>
        <p>So the choice of a new leader for the PRI looms large, making Mr. Madrazo's success in controlling his own state -- but his failure to hold it convincingly -- all the more important for Mexico.</p>
        <p>To his opponents inside and outside the party, Mr. Madrazo is a figure of the past, scarred by many accusations of abusing power, misusing money and manipulating public opinion. Six years ago, after he was elected governor, President Ernesto Zedillo tried and failed to force him to resign when documents revealed that he had illegally financed his campaign with millions of dollars in public money.</p>
