        <p>SVIRIDOFF-Mitchell. It is with deepest sorrow that the Local Initiatives Support Corporation mourns the passing of its founder Mitchell Sviridoff. Like thousands of community development corporations from coast to coast, LISC owes much of its growth and success, and in our case our very existence, to Mike Sviridoff's vision, energy, and wisdom. Mike has been a source of inspiration and confidence to people and organizations across America who often had no other champions, no material wealth, and little political influence. With his encouragement and example, they have transformed poor neighborhoods and rural communities against overwhelming odds. Mike has been the visionary, conscience, mentor, and teacher to three generations of grassroots entrepreneurs. His leadership is irreplaceable, but his example will remain a national treasure. Michael Rubinger, Pres. &amp; CEO Robert E. Rubin, Chairman</p>
        <p>SVIRIDOFF - Mitchell. The Trustees and staff of the Vera Institute of Justice extend their deepest sympathy to our colleague Michele and the rest of the family of Mitchell Sviridoff, friend and former Vice President of the Vera Institute. As a Vice President of the Ford Foundation, he envisioned and helped create program still working today to improve conditions of urban life. He was a man of character and inspiration, and we are in his debt. Frederick A.O. Schwarz, Jr., Chair Christopher Stone, President</p>
        <p>SVIRIDOFF-Mitchell. The Board and staff of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation mourn the death of founding father &amp; longtime Boardmember Mitchell Sviridoff. His vision, creative genius, and commitment to improving the lives of low-income people are his enduring legacy. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and colleagues.</p>
