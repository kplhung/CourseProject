        <p>Hotwire.com, an online ticket-selling service backed by six major airlines, plans to open its Web site today. The San Francisco start-up secured initial financing of $75 million in January from the Texas Pacific Group, a private investment firm that has owned stakes in two of the airlines: Continental and America West. The other Hotwire-affliated airlines are American Airlines, Northwest Airlines, United Airlines and US Airways, to sell excess inventory -- seats that would otherwise be unfilled and that are not published on industrywide sites like Travelocity.com and Expedia.com. Hotwire's chief executive, Karl Peterson, says the company wants to make it easier to set travel plans with a home computer. Priceline, another online travel site, for example, requires users to bid for seats and accept the lowest fare offered. Hotwire, however, negotiates with airlines to determine the lowest possible fare for a desired route; the consumer then has the option to accept the offered rate. The process lasts minutes rather than hours, he said. Hotwire has been operating a beta site about six weeks.</p>

        <p>TECHNOLOGY BRIEFING: E-COMMERCE  Correction:  October 31, 2000, Tuesday  A report in the Technology Briefing column of Business Day last Tuesday about the opening of Hotwire.com, an online airline ticket service, misstated the practices of Priceline.com, a competitor. Its users propose a price they are willing to pay for tickets and must buy them if Priceline can match that price. Priceline does not require users to bid for seats and accept the lowest fare offered.</p>
