        <p>OLSON-Sidney L. We mourn the passing of our dear friend, Benefactor and esteemed member of our Board of Overseers, whose commitment to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University and compassion for others is both a legacy and an inspiration. With his beloved wife, the late Miriam K. Olson, he established a professorial chair in cardiology at our institution and was a Fellow of the University's Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. In recognition of his outstanding service to his community, the University awarded him an honorary degree and the College presented him with its Distinguished Achievement Award. To his children, Norman Olson and Arlene Muravchick, to his grandchildren and to the entire family, we offer our heartfelt condolences. Yeshiva University Dr. Norman Lamm, President Robert M. Beren, Chairman Board of Trustees Albert Einstein College of Medicine Robert A. Belfer, Chairperson Board of Overseers Dr. Dominick P. Purpura The Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean</p>
