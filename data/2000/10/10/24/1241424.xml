        <p>Marie Sylvain, a longtime nursing home worker, was so upset about her low wages and workload -- feeding, washing, dressing and changing linens for 14 patients each shift -- that she decided to lead a unionization drive.</p>
        <p>But her employer soon fired her, and the organizing drive quickly fizzled as her 70 co-workers feared that they would also be dismissed if they pushed for a union.</p>
        <p>That was four and a half years ago. Today, Ms. Sylvain voices intense frustration that, because of extended legal appeals, she has still not been reinstated even though a judge ruled nearly three years ago that her firing violated the National Labor Relations Act, which prohibits employers from firing or penalizing workers for supporting a union.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sylvain's dismissal made her one of thousands of workers who are fired, demoted or otherwise punished each year for backing a union. A recent study of National Labor Relations Board data showed that from 1992 to 1997, employers fired or punished more than 125,000 workers for supporting a union.</p>
        <p>Numerous academic studies  showed that it frequently took three to five years for fired workers to be reinstated, delays that union leaders said often caused organizing drives to die at a time when the labor movement was seeking to add hundreds of thousands of members and reverse its decades-long decline.</p>
        <p>''U.S. labor law is stacked against employees who wish to organize a union, allowing employers to intimidate and coerce workers not to unionize,'' said John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.</p>
        <p>But some experts said unions were having trouble attracting members, not because of firings and delays by the labor board, but because of economic changes, especially the shift from manufacturing to services.</p>
        <p>''Job growth is coming where unions are historically weak,'' said Leo Troy, a labor economist at Rutgers University. ''The economy is leaving unions behind. Employer behavior is virtually irrelevant to labor's decline. Employer behavior is an easy scapegoat.''</p>
        <p>The concern about obstacles to organizing is one reason labor is supporting Vice President Al Gore in the presidential race despite differences with him over trade. In numerous appearances at union conventions, Mr. Gore has vowed to push for changes that would make it easier for unions to organize.</p>
        <p>''Vice President Gore has been the most outspoken champion of the freedom to join a union since Franklin Delano Roosevelt,'' Mr. Sweeney said.</p>
        <p>A recent report by Human Rights Watch concluded that because of systematic violations by employers and long delays in obtaining legal redress, the United States was essentially violating international agreements guaranteeing the rights of workers to form unions.</p>
        <p>''Most people view these issues as just a labor-management dispute,'' said Lance Compa, a Cornell University labor relations professor who wrote the Human Rights Watch report, ''but we think the focus should be that there is a right of freedom of association recognized under international law, and that right is being widely denied in the United States.''</p>
        <p>In the 1950's, several hundred workers suffered reprisals each year for backing a union, according to National Labor Relations Board data. But Charles Morris, a professor emeritus at Southern Methodist University, said that by the late 1990's, employers carried out reprisals against more than 20,000 union supporters each year. He also found that 1 out of 18 workers involved in unionization drives faced some type of punishment for supporting the union.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sylvain said her firing frightened other workers from backing a union at Palm Gardens nursing home.</p>
        <p>''They say, 'Look what happened to Marie,' '' said Ms. Sylvain, who said she was paid $6.50 an hour at the nursing home and needed food stamps and Medicaid to support herself and two children. ''The law gives you something with one hand, and then it takes it away with the other.''</p>
        <p>But business groups argued that after eight years under President Clinton, the nation's enforcement was stacked against management, not unions.</p>
        <p>''Back in the 1950's, unions were fat and happy and represented 35 percent of the labor force,'' said Randy Johnson, vice president for labor policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>''Now that they represent just 9 percent of private-sector workers,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''they're blaming the law for their problems. They're trying to create a straw man instead of looking at the more logical explanation that the message unions have for workers isn't selling.''</p>
        <p>Many labor experts said the penalties that employers faced for firing union supporters were so modest that it made economic sense for companies to flout the law.</p>
        <p>When the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Ernest Duval and six other fired workers should be reinstated five years after a nursing home in Palm Beach, Fla., fired them for leading a unionization drive, the labor board concluded that he was owed $1,800 in back pay. The award was modest because federal law requires employers to pay the wages workers missed after their dismissal, minus whatever they earned in other jobs they took after being fired.</p>
        <p>The Human Rights Watch report said: ''An employer determined to get rid of a union activist knows that all that awaits, after years of litigation if the employer persists in appeals, is a reinstatement order the worker is likely to decline and a modest back-pay award. For many employers, it is a small price to pay to destroy a workers' organizing effort by firing its leaders.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Compa said: ''Firing is the single most potent anti-union weapon. The upshot is many employers can achieve their goal of remaining union-free by breaking the law.''</p>
        <p>Vice President Gore has yet to spell out how he would change labor laws to make it easier to form unions. Also looking for ways to discourage illegal firings, Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate, has proposed that improperly fired union supporters receive punitive damages and lawyers' fees. Gov. George W. Bush, who has long clashed with unions, has not called for making it easier for workers to unionize.</p>
        <p>Labor leaders said that as long as the Republicans controlled Congress, it would be difficult to enact laws making it easier to form unions. But, these leaders said, some steps could be taken under existing law, among them having the labor board's lawyers seek more injunctions that would quickly reinstate wrongly fired workers. That would allow the terminated employee to remain on the job during appeals.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sylvain said she wished a court could have ordered her back to work while her case was appealed. In January 1998, 21 months after she was fired, an administrative law judge ruled that the nursing home had fired her illegally and that she should be reinstated. The judge found that the nursing home had concocted a story for firing by saying she took time off without filling out the required vacation forms.</p>
        <p>In March 1999, the National Labor Relations Board in Washington affirmed that decision, but the nursing home appealed. On Oct. 5, a federal appeals court affirmed the labor board and ruled that Ms. Sylvain should be reinstated.</p>
        <p>She is still not back on the job because the labor board has yet to negotiate her reinstatement with her the nursing home.</p>
