        <p>George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, has agreed to release several hundred documents related to United States covert operations in Chile in the years around the 1973 military coup that ousted President Salvador Allende, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tenet, who last summer tried to block the release of about 700 secret documents from the Central Intelligence Agency and other government agencies, has agreed to free up all but two dozen of them, although many of the papers may be heavily censored, officials said.</p>
        <p>The documents, which are scheduled to be released on Nov. 13, are part of a declassification project ordered by President Clinton last year to shed light on human rights abuses, terrorism and other acts of political violence in Chile between 1968 and 1990. The C.I.A. promoted efforts to topple Dr. Allende, a Socialist, and included leaders of the succeeding military government among its informants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tenet in August overruled his own declassification experts and sought to withhold about 450 C.I.A. documents and 250 documents from other government agencies on the grounds that they would reveal too much about how the agency conducts its business worldwide. But he then agreed to an additional review of the papers by members of the White House and the State Department.</p>
        <p>Bill Leary, the White House official who led that review, today announced that Mr. Tenet and the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, had agreed to release ''virtually all'' of the documents in question.</p>
