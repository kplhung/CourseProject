        <p>Scientists studying the planet's stressed-out rain forests, rivers, reefs, deserts and islands are increasingly confronting a new kind of species -- the living dead. They are extant, but, in almost every way, are already extinct.</p>

        <p>Scientists studying the planet's stressed-out rain forests, rivers, reefs, deserts and islands are increasingly confronting a new kind of species -- the living dead. They are extant, but, in almost every way, are already extinct.</p>
        <p>There is the Javan rhinoceros, reduced to 70 or so animals split between a tiny tract in Indonesia and another in Vietnam. There is the golden Vizcacha rat, which was recently discovered along one edge of a remote salt flat in northwest Argentina, just in time for its discoverers to see its tiny habitat being replaced by irrigated olive orchards.</p>
        <p>Then there is the Hawaiian po'ouli. The number of these black-masked honeycreepers on the mountains of Maui has dropped from about 200 in the 1970's to just 3 today. Each inhabits a separate bit of mountainside, unaware it is not alone. Scientists do not know the sex of the birds.</p>
        <p>Such species, to borrow a bleak phrase from emergency-room doctors, are circling the drain. But they have been able to persist far longer than the experts studying them ever anticipated.</p>
        <p>It turns out that many species on their last legs -- or wings or bellies or roots -- somehow find ways to adapt, albeit temporarily, to stark changes in their surroundings. Lonely hearts occasionally find each other to bear a few more offspring and so keep a unique genetic branch on the tree of life growing just a little bit longer.</p>
        <p>They have come to symbolize the challenges faced by biologists who are studying and trying to save endangered species. Extinction has proved to be complex and sometimes excruciatingly slow, often tantalizing conservationists with the prospect of bringing a fading species back.</p>
        <p>Some, like the Puerto Rican parrot, which has rebounded after seeing its population fall to just 12 birds, do seem capable of recovering. But others do not, even when they stare a biologist in the face.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stuart L. Pimm, an extinction expert at Columbia University, pointed to the example of the po'ouli, whose last known members were tracked down several years ago by two of his postdoctoral students after three years of slogging through sodden forests.</p>
        <p>''There is an extraordinary sense of loss when you see wonderful animals and plants and you know you may be the last people to see them,'' Dr. Pimm said. ''The po'ouli lingered below 10 or 20 individuals for years. It's rather like looking at some old, beloved relative who you know is simply not going to last another year or two. You don't know exactly when old uncle Joe is going to die.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the dogged quality of life in its end stages has come as a slight embarrassment to more than a few ecologists and conservation biologists. Two decades ago, in studies like the Carter administration's Global 2000 Report, many experts were predicting that some 20 percent of the world's species at that time would be erased by now -- largely because of the accelerating, intensifying impact of humans on the landscape.</p>
        <p>That may well be happening, but no one has proved it. In fact, often as not -- at least for conspicuous creatures like birds and mammals -- an isolated few specimens tend to pop up just when scientists have decided they cannot possibly still exist.</p>
        <p>There is a growing realization among ecologists that the endgame for species is not nearly as straightforward as it is portrayed in mathematical models. These predict extinction rates by crunching the density of species in a habitat, the size of the habitat and the rate at which it is destroyed. The discrepancy between theory and reality has led some biologists to call for a change in the way conservationists describe the extinction process to the public, and in the way that scientists study it.</p>
        <p>A growing group of paleontologists and ecologists are calling for a new push to improve the data behind estimates and to stop making broad statements comparing current events to past cataclysmic extinction spasms like the one that erased the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Those comparisons, they say, implied a level of clarity in the science that just does not exist. They add that scientists should emphasize that extinction itself happens over a span that is always going to be hard to measure or comprehend.</p>
        <p>''In thinking about global extinction we've got to free ourselves from this human time scale,'' said Dr. John Alroy, an ecologist at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis of the University of California at Santa Barbara. ''To a species, a human lifetime is a little flicker.''</p>
        <p>Human-caused extinctions are happening, Dr. Alroy said, and he is one of many biologists who are convinced that the pace is rapidly accelerating. It is just that this wave of biological losses is building but has yet to break.</p>
        <p>Only in retrospect, when some future culture -- human or otherwise -- examines the fossil record, will the die-off be evident as a substantial pruning of the branches of the tree of life, he said. ''For the entire remaining duration of life on earth,'' he said, ''this event we're responsible for is clearly going to show up as a signature.''</p>
        <p>Instead of focusing on the nearly immeasurable moment when a species ceases to exist, he and other biologists say, science should focus harder on the forces that lead toward extinction -- the destruction or fragmentation of habitat, the introduction of invasive species, the appropriation of water or other vital resources.</p>
        <p>Dr. Alroy is one of dozens of scientists who are essentially trying to forge a new discipline, extinction biology, incorporating ideas from field studies, genetics, ecology and paleontology.</p>
        <p>They are seeking to know -- up close and in current time -- a process that formerly was almost exclusively studied by paleontologists digging through dusty layers of fossils. Mostly, they are trying to develop an agenda to improve the scientific underpinnings that could clarify why some species last and others do not.</p>
        <p>Part of the difficulty in extending extinction science from the past into the present lies in figuring out how to reconcile the clues left by past comings and goings of species with those providing hints of what may be happening to existing species.</p>
        <p>The main tool used by biologists to calculate current extinction rates is a longstanding formula called the species-area curve, which gives an estimate of species lost for a given area of habitat destroyed. Another is population viability analysis, which uses computer models to project trends in a range of conditions affecting isolated populations of a species and calculates the probability of long-time survival.</p>
        <p>''Conservation biologists see changes in the environment and estimate the impact on species, while paleontologists see a record of change in species and try to match what environmental issues drove those changes,'' said Dr. David Jablonski, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago. ''The fundamental problem in all this is the ways we estimate extinction intensities are totally different.''</p>
        <p>Many conservation biologists and groups have compared the current extinction episode with the five great dyings that punctuate the fossil record, but Dr. Jablonski and many paleontologists say the data are so different -- and so incomplete in both realms -- that there is no way to relate past extinctions to whatever is happening now.</p>
        <p>Much more needs to be done to mesh the two disciplines, he said, adding, ''Often, I'm the token paleontologist at conservation biology meetings.'' That has to change, he said.</p>
        <p>A central challenge frustrating scientists studying the most imperiled species is that they are just nibbling at the edges of the world's biological diversity, a fact borne out in the vast gap between the number of species classified by science -- fewer than 2 million -- and the latest far-flung estimates of what is out there: anywhere from 7 million to more than 100 million, depending on who is counting.</p>
        <p>The complexity of extinction, and the vastness of the biosphere, have prompted many scientists to call for a large increase in the number of biologists working both in the field and in museums or laboratories to clarify the relationships and characteristics of the planet's myriad endangered life forms.</p>
        <p>Dr. Edward O. Wilson, an entomologist and ecologist at Harvard University who helped invent the current methods of estimating extinction rates, published an essay in Science last month calling for a large effort to improve mapping of biodiversity around the world.</p>
        <p>''Right now we spend between $150 million and $200 million a year in the United States on studying global fauna and flora,'' Dr. Wilson said. ''That's just dabbling. Compared to the magnitude of the problem, it's chump change.''</p>
        <p>He and other biologists acknowledge that the need comes just as the explosion of advances in genetics and molecular biology is attracting some of biology's brightest young minds -- and a lot of the available grants and government money.</p>
        <p>''If you say I want to go out and look for new mammals that have never been found, it's hard to get support,'' said Dr. Michael A. Mares, a mammalogist and director of the Sam Noble Oklahoma Natural History Museum at the University of Oklahoma. It was Dr. Mares whose team recently discovered the golden Vizcacha rat living on the edge of salt flats.</p>
        <p>The nocturnal rodent eats a desert plant that is four times as salty as sea water. Dr. Mares discovered it while working far from the ''biodiversity hot spots'' that have become a prime focus of conservationists lately. Even in remote Argentinian deserts, pressure from agriculture is intruding, he said.</p>
        <p>While areas with the most species and the most threats are clearly vital to protect, he said, someone has to keep looking on the fringes.</p>
        <p>''In this very isolated valley, you've got the possibility of three or four species and one genus disappearing with very little habitat damage,'' he said. ''These are not charismatic species,'' he added. ''But they play an important role in the ecosystem and do some very interesting things.''</p>
        <p>Other biologists stress the importance, at the same time, of improving understanding of what is happening close to home, in places like the woods tucked amid American suburbs. Extinction and endangerment are not limited to faraway tropics, said Dr. David B. Wake, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who divides his time between the cloud forests of Costa Rica, the suburbs of Southern California and the stream-laced mountains of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wake, whose work in Costa Rica 15 years ago first hinted that a substantial die-off of frogs and other amphibians was taking place, said that salamanders tucked in moist pockets of woodlands in Southern California contained enormous genetic diversity.</p>
        <p>Now, though, isolated populations are being quietly rooted out with each advance of roads and subdivisions, he said. ''I've watched this happen,'' he said. ''I've seen these tiny spots going out. A cougar or bird couldn't exist there, but salamanders can. The challenge for the future is not that we're losing all these species in the rain forest; we're losing them in our backyards.''</p>
        <p>Finally, some scientists say, for extinction biology to gain more credibility, more work is needed to improve the basic taxonomic data determining just what is a species. Last year, Dr. Ross D. E. MacPhee, the curator of mammals at the American Museum of Natural History, published an analysis of the mammal extinctions in the 1996 Red List, a quadrennial roster of the planet's intensive care ward published by the World Conservation Union, and found dozens of instances in which species on the list either were not extinct or were misidentified -- and also of extinct species that the list had missed. A separate analysis of data for fish extinctions produced similar findings.</p>
        <p>Some biologists stress that concern over the current turmoil in the natural world should be tempered with the awareness that change, sometimes a lot of it -- including extinctions and new bursts of speciation -- is an essential part of the ferment of life on earth.</p>
        <p>And life can prove quite tough and adaptable. Puerto Rico, which lost 97 percent of its forests in the centuries following European settlement, is almost completely forested again, local scientists say, with a mix of exotic and native species. And sometimes species, with a little help, do pull back from the brink. The ginkgo tree was nearly extinct in its home range of China, preserved only on the grounds of a few monasteries. Now it has spread around the world and is ensconced in some rather unforgiving ecosystems, including Brooklyn.</p>
