        <p>City officials announced today that they had chosen a former F.B.I. special agent who is now a police chief in Texas to lead Hartford's demoralized, understaffed police department.</p>
        <p>City officials said the new chief, Bruce Preston Marquis, now the chief of the Houston Independent School District, had the leadership skills and ideas necessary to right a police department that has been marked by scandal and is badly in need of change.</p>
        <p>City Manager Saundra Kee Borges said she picked Mr. Marquis, 48, on Wednesday from a field of five candidates because of his ''different perspective'' as an outsider with no allegiance to any local political or police groups.</p>
        <p>''We need somebody to come in and take control of the department,'' Ms. Kee Borges said after announcing her choice today. ''I think we're all looking for major changes in the police department and we're looking for the chief to make them.''</p>
        <p>The city manager said the Hartford police and the city's residents need a dose of steady, consistent leadership from a strong chief.</p>
        <p>The city has been without a permanent chief of police since April 1999, when Chief Joseph Croughwell Jr. took a medical leave, and later retired. At that time, Ms. Kee Borges appointed Capt. Deborah Barrows as acting chief, but scandals that had already begun continued to trouble the department. Since 1998, six officers have been indicted on federal charges of repeatedly forcing prostitutes to have sex with them.</p>
        <p>Last year, an independent national consultant hired by the city issued a thick report describing a department bereft of the policies, personnel and discipline needed to serve a city this size adequately.</p>
        <p>And in July, after the chief state's attorney, John M. Bailey Jr., announced that the Hartford Police Department had not handed over more than $700,000 in drug money and other confiscated property, Ms. Kee Borges demoted Ms. Barrows and appointed Capt. Robert Rudewicz to the acting chief job.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marquis discussed the Hartford police in a telephone interview today. ''I think the biggest problem they have is a lack of leadership,'' he said. ''Basically, the command staff is vacant.'' His top priority, he said, would be to assemble a management team by hiring two deputy chiefs and several assistant chiefs. He said he was ready to fix the department's major problems.</p>
        <p>As a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in Houston in the 1980's and 1990's, he tackled street gangs and served as a member of the bureau's Fugitive Task Force, according to information posted on the Houston school district's Web site. Earlier, he was a senior security manager for the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. In the 1970's, he was a captain in the United States Air Force and served on its police force.</p>
        <p>Asked about his new life in Hartford, he said that it would be the first time he would have spent extended time in New England, but that he was impressed with Hartford's city leaders and their plans for the future.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marquis was born in Oakland, Calif., and raised in San Francisco. His first day on the job, which pays $105,000 a year, will be Dec. 4, city officials said.</p>
