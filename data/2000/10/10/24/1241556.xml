        <p>The investment in women's soccer is starting to pay off handsomely at universities like Notre Dame, Nebraska, Penn State and Clemson. The latest program in the news is Florida State, a school without a men's program.</p>
        <p>Florida State made the perennial power North Carolina its fourth victim among top-20 schools last week with a thrilling 3-2 double-overtime victory in Tallahassee. The Seminoles had defeated Florida, Texas A&amp;M and Wake Forest before they registered perhaps the biggest upset of the year on a goal by the freshman defender Kristin Boyce.</p>
        <p>North Carolina's loss to Florida State was the first time that the Tar Heels (12-2) had lost two games in the regular season. The first loss this year for the 16-time national champion Tar Heels came at the hands of Clemson (15-1-1), the leader in the Atlantic Coast Conference.</p>
        <p>The victory over North Carolina just about guaranteed the Seminoles (11-5-1) a place in the national tournament. They had a 3-30-2 record through their first five years in the A.C.C. and had lost every conference tournament game.</p>
        <p>''I thought we needed four big wins to get into the N.C.A.A. tournament, and we already had three,'' said Patrick Baker, who is in his second year as coach of the Seminoles. ''I didn't really anticipate the fourth one coming against North Carolina.''</p>
        <p>Florida State could not stand prosperity after that victory. It lost to Maryland over the weekend, but still moved up in the coaches' poll, to No. 17 from No. 23. Notre Dame (16-0-1) is rated No. 1, with Washington (15-1) at No. 2 and Nebraska (17-1) No. 3, ahead of Clemson and North Carolina.</p>
        <p>In the men's poll, San Jose State (14-0-1), which is the only undefeated team, is rated No. 1 for the second week in a row, followed by Southern Methodist (14-2), the defending champion Indiana (13-3), North Carolina (14-2) and Connecticut (11-2-2).</p>
        <p>METROSTARS</p>
        <p>The MetroStars are in Germany and Lothar Matthaus is still with the team. Matthaus will play for the MetroStars in tomorrow's exhibition game at Salzburg, Austria, and will also play against F.C. Cologne in Germany next Tuesday, but he is not expected to accompany the team when it returns to the United States on Nov. 1.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars were short of players for their trip to Germany and Austria because Mike Petke and Clint Mathis were with the United States national team for an exhibition game against Mexico tomorrow in Los Angeles, and Billy Walsh was nursing an injury to his left knee. As a result, the MetroStars got midfielder Kevin Anderson on loan from Tampa Bay as a guest player for the two games in Europe.</p>
        <p>ENGLAND</p>
        <p>A foreigner may be hired as coach of the national team for the first time. Arsene Wenger of France and Sven Goran Eriksson of Sweden emerged as the top candidates for the job yesterday, with Roy Hodgson of England, who has coached in Europe, as the third choice.</p>
        <p>While the country's governing body would confirm only that it would make its first move to contact three candidates within a few days, bookmakers did not hesitate to identify the three men as the front-runners to replace Kevin Keegan, who resigned this month after a 1-0 loss to Germany in a World Cup qualifying game.</p>
        <p>Wenger is the coach at London-based Arsenal, while Eriksson coaches Lazio in Rome and Hodgson, who coached Switzerland in the 1994 World Cup in the United States, now coaches Copenhagen in Denmark. Some make Eriksson the first choice because Wenger has a contract with Arsenal until 2002. Bobby Robson and Terry Venables, who coached England in the past and were serious contenders at one point, are no longer considered the favorites for the job.</p>
        <p>Peter Taylor, who directs Leicester City of the Premier League, has been named the interim coach and will be on the sideline Nov. 15 when the national team plays Italy in Turin. Taylor expects to be in charge for only one game.</p>
        <p>''I am determined to enjoy my three days with the England squad as much as possible,'' Taylor told the BBC.</p>
        <p>GERMANY</p>
        <p>Coach Christoph Daum lost two jobs in one day. A positive drug test meant he was no longer in charge of Bayer Leverkusen and would not be taking over the national team from Rudi Voller. Daum had denied accusations that he had used cocaine and participated in sex parties with prostitutes. After news of the positive test on a hair sample, the German federation, which was set to offer Daum a three-year contract to succeed Voller next summer, withdrew the deal.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>After a heartbreaking loss to the Kansas City Wizards in the championship game of Major League Soccer, the Chicago Fire captured the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open title with a 2-1 victory over the Miami Fusion on Saturday. ... The Costa Rican federation accused its Guatemalan counterpart of whipping up bad feelings before next month's World Cup qualifier between the countries, which will be staged in Guatemala and will have an effect on the United States' clash in Barbados the same day. Costa Rican soccer officials said they had protested to FIFA after their supporters learned they were banned from the Nov. 15 game. ... Pele celebrated his 60th birthday yesterday in excellent health with a party in Brazil. He said in a recent interview that he weighed 172 pounds when he returned from the Cosmos in 1977 and his weight now was 178 pounds. ... The Mexican Luis Hernandez, who played for the Los Angeles Galaxy, scored a goal and was awarded a penalty in his debut on loan from M.L.S. to America, the richest club in Mexico.</p>
