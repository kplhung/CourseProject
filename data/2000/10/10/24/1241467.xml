        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>A MESSAGE TO NADER VOTERS -- Ralph Nader supporters who worry that they could tip the presidential election to the Republicans are being told in a new advertising campaign that a ''vote for Nader is not a vote for Bush.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader, the Green Party candidate, currently draws about 4 percent in national polls, and some Democrats fear he could siphon enough votes from Vice President Al Gore to give Gov. George W. Bush of Texas the edge in several states with close races.</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>A MESSAGE TO NADER VOTERS -- Ralph Nader supporters who worry that they could tip the presidential election to the Republicans are being told in a new advertising campaign that a ''vote for Nader is not a vote for Bush.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader, the Green Party candidate, currently draws about 4 percent in national polls, and some Democrats fear he could siphon enough votes from Vice President Al Gore to give Gov. George W. Bush of Texas the edge in several states with close races.</p>
        <p>Full-page advertisements scheduled to run on Thursday in the national edition of The New York Times, The Village Voice, The Boston Globe, The Boston Phoenix, The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Weekly, The Austin American-Statesman, The Austin Chronicle, The San Francisco Chronicle, The San Francisco Examiner, The San Francisco Bay Guardian and The Boulder Camera in Colorado. ''Why Voting for a Candidate Who Can't Win Is the Smartest Thing You'll Ever Do,'' the advertisement reads, ''And Don't Worry, a Vote for Nader is Not a Vote for Bush.'' The campaign is meant to appeal to independents, former supporters of Senator John McCain's Republican candidacy and ''disgruntled Democrats'' who might otherwise sit out the election, said Greg MacArthur, whose group, Citizens for Strategic Voting, paid for the advertisements.</p>

        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>DRAFTING A GOVERNOR'S WIDOW -- At the time of his death in a plane crash last week, Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri, a Democrat, was making a strong run in his effort to unseat Senator John Ashcroft, a Republican. So what happens next, given that Mr. Carnahan's death occurred after the deadline for putting a new name on the ballot?</p>
        <p>The race is still on. If Mr. Ashcroft wins, he wins. If Mr. Carnahan wins, the state's new governor, Roger B. Wilson, who was the lieutenant governor, will name someone to serve. Mr. Wilson is a Democrat. And he has come under considerable pressure from the state's Democratic leaders to promise to appoint Mr. Carnahan's widow, Jean, should Mr. Carnahan win. The thinking seems to be that the prospect of Mrs. Carnahan continuing her husband's work will help carry the party to victory. Mr. Wilson has scheduled a news conference for this morning to address the issue.</p>
        <p>As for Mrs. Carnahan, she has given no indication whether she is interested in serving in the Senate.</p>

        <p>THE VOTERS</p>
        <p>MUSLIM GROUPS BACK BUSH -- By some estimates, there may be as many as six million Muslims in the United States, a relatively small population in a country of some 275 million people. But in a close race, a small vote can loom large, especially when, as in the case of the Muslim vote, it is concentrated in crucial states like California, Michigan, Virginia and New York.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, an American Muslim political action committee, representing four Muslim organizations, endorsed Gov. George W. Bush, saying he had been accessible to Muslim organizations and had showed himself responsive to their concerns over sensitive issues like deportation. The PAC is a branch of the two-year-old American Muslim Political Coordinating Council, made up of the American Muslim Alliance, American Muslim Council, the Council on American-Islamic Affairs and the Muslim Public Affairs Council. Aly Abuzaakouk , the Coordinating Council's executive director, said Mr. Bush had met with American Muslim leaders last March in Austin and in general had been ''more responsive to us than the Al Gore campaign.''</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>EMBATTLED TEXAS OFFICIAL RESIGNS -- The Texas Commissioner of Health, Dr. William R. Archer III, whose comments on race, cultural attitudes and health insurance, have embarrassed his boss, George W. Bush, resigned yesterday. The move came less than a week after he was placed on leave after statements about race were secretly recorded by a black female employee who had been fired. She filed a discrimination complaint. Dr. Archer's tongue also got him into trouble last spring, when he played down the importance of health insurance and blamed the state's high teenage pregnancy rate on the cultural attitudes of Hispanics. Dr. Archer also had come under criticism for his management of the agency.</p>
