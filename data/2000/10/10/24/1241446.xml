        <p>A month after fleeing, the former intelligence chief returned here today, plunging the government of President Alberto K. Fujimori into disarray.</p>
        <p>First Vice President Francisco Tudela, a close ally of Mr. Fujimori, resigned, saying of the intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, who fled to escape allegations of corruption, ''The game he is playing with the country outrages me.''</p>
        <p>Downtown Lima was filled with tear gas as the police and protesters clashed. Opposition leaders, fearing that Mr. Montesinos might be planning a coup with the military high command, pledged to take to the streets.</p>
        <p>In Washington, a spokesman for the White House, Jake Siewert, said, ''Any move to disrupt the constitutional order would lead to Peru's isolation.''</p>
        <p>It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Montesinos's return was the last play of a high-stakes gambler or part of an army plot to force the opposition to accept a sweeping amnesty for the security forces, covering not only human rights violations, but perhaps also arms trafficking and drug dealing.</p>
        <p>Over the last three days, the government has proposed an amnesty as part of the Constitution, a step that would require 80 of the 120 votes in Congress. Because the government has a paper-thin majority in the legislature, it would need the opposition to go along.</p>
        <p>The government is insisting that an amnesty has to be set before a date for presidential elections can be scheduled. Senior military officials have been pressing Mr. Fujimori for the amnesty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos left Panama City, where he had been in exile, on Sunday evening on a private jet with two Panamanian lawyers and a bodyguard for Guayaquil, Ecuador. The former intelligence chief never left the Guayaquil airport, where he reportedly bought food and cellular telephone cards. In the predawn hours, his aircraft flew to Peru without an official flight plan.</p>
        <p>Authorities at the Lima international airport refused to give Mr. Montesinos permission to land, Peruvian officials said, and the plane continued to Pisco, on the Pacific Coast, 160 miles south of Lima, where he landed before dawn today at the airport on a strip controlled by the air force.</p>
        <p>According to radio reports, Mr. Montesinos spent the day in a military hanger in Pisco, where the air force keeps a fleet of combat jets and military helicopters. By nightfall his whereabouts were not clear.</p>
        <p>The response of government officials was one of surprise and confusion. Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez called Mr. Montesinos's return worrisome, adding, ''If he is trying to pressure the country, it should not be permitted.''</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Federico Salas said Mr. Montesinos had chosen to leave Panama because he believed that he would not be granted asylum. ''If he comes to Lima,'' Mr. Salas said, ''I presume he will go to his law office.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori remained silent. He spent much of the day in the presidential palace, where he summoned his cabinet and the commanders of the navy, air force and army for consultations. Late in the afternoon, he drove in a motorcade with his interior and defense ministers to visit military and intelligence installations around Lima.</p>
        <p>Military analysts characterized Mr. Montesinos's landing here as a direct challenge to the president's authority by the military. ''If the president doesn't take drastic action, we are on the cusp of a great crisis,'' Daniel Mora, a retired army general, said. ''He must show he is the commander in chief.''</p>
        <p>United States diplomats said Mr. Fujimori and cabinet members spoke to Mr. Montesinos last week, requesting that he not return.</p>
        <p>''This was the last thing they wanted,'' said a senior Clinton administration official.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos, for 10 years Mr. Fujimori's closest adviser, was not legally barred from returning.</p>
        <p>Even as he sought asylum in Panama, Mr. Montesinos continued to pull strings in Peru and even spoke regularly on the telephone with Mr. Fujimori. The president, after a disputed re-election, stunned the nation last month by saying he would step down in July.</p>
        <p>The lead prosecutor, chosen by Mr. Montesinos, declared during his stay in Panama that there would be no investigation or prosecution of the former spy chief.</p>
        <p>Opposition leaders called for Mr. Fujimori to step down, to be replaced by a transitional government through the election of a new president. The transition administration would include independents and a retired general, Francisco Morales Bermudez, the last military dictator who ushered in a return to democracy in the late 70's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori ''has been pinned to the wall and can no longer govern,'' Mayor Alberto Andrade of Lima said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos has been a lightning rod of controversy since the presidential campaign this year. He ran a dirty tricks campaign against opposition candidates and directed the election apparatus that came under heavy criticism from the Organization of American States for fraud.</p>
        <p>A man with a taste for double-breasted suits and Bach, Mr. Montesinos was long a close associate of the Central Intelligence Agency, according to Peruvian and American officials. He directed an antinarcotics unit in the National Intelligence Service with C.I.A. guidance and was a conduit for United States intelligence and advice in antiterrorism efforts, the officials said.</p>
        <p>His relationship to the United States dates from the 70's, when he was a captain in the prime minister's office. He was cashiered and imprisoned by the army in 1977, after he had been found handing documents to the United States that detailed Russian arms sales to the left-wing military government and traveling to Washington without permission.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration finally broke with Mr. Montesinos two months ago, when evidence emerged that former and current military officials allied with Mr. Montesinos had sold Russian rifles to the largest Marxist guerrilla group in Colombia, United States officials said. Former Peruvian intelligence officers have said Mr. Montesinos was involved in the gun-running or knew about it but remained quiet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos was finally forced to leave his position as unofficial head of national intelligence last month, when a cable television station displayed a tape that showed him handing over an envelope stuffed with cash to a newly elected opposition member of Congress in return for a promise to switch parties. The tape was apparently leaked to the station by navy officers attached to the intelligence agency.</p>
        <p>At first, Mr. Fujimori dismissed Mr. Montesinos. But members of the army high command stood by the intelligence chief. With his powers dwindling, Mr. Fujimori stunned the nation by announcing that he would leave office on July 28, after new elections and four years before the end of his third term.</p>
        <p>He also promised to disband the the intelligence unit run by Mr. Montesinos, whose activities have been taken over by army intelligence.</p>
        <p>Alejandro Toledo, an opposition leader who ran for president, said  the opposition would not go along with the proposal for amnesty for military officers. ''We cannot accept gangster extortion,'' Mr. Toledo said.</p>
        <p>Santiago Pedraglio, a columnist for Gestion, a newspaper in Lima, called Mr. Montesinos's return ''an act of political desperation'' and said him and his allies in the military, ''They can still cause great problems, but they are strategically defeated.''</p>
