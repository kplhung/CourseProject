        <p>Sweeping down the red carpet at the VH1/ Vogue fashion awards on Friday night, Andre Leon Talley, Vogue's editor at large, eclipsed even high-wattage stars like Uma Thurman, Christian Slater, Lenny Kravitz and fashion's premier bird of paradise, Donatella Versace, who was poured into a shockingly slashed gown.</p>
        <p>Mr. Talley pivoted for the televison cameras to show off his own plumage: a floor-length Fendi broadtail coat, a Fred Leighton diamond tiara wrapped around his throat and the model Sophie Dahl slung on his arm like an Hermes tote. ''This is an occasion, and I think one should dress for it,'' he said.</p>

        <p>Sweeping down the red carpet at the VH1/ Vogue fashion awards on Friday night, Andre Leon Talley, Vogue's editor at large, eclipsed even high-wattage stars like Uma Thurman, Christian Slater, Lenny Kravitz and fashion's premier bird of paradise, Donatella Versace, who was poured into a shockingly slashed gown.</p>
        <p>Mr. Talley pivoted for the televison cameras to show off his own plumage: a floor-length Fendi broadtail coat, a Fred Leighton diamond tiara wrapped around his throat and the model Sophie Dahl slung on his arm like an Hermes tote. ''This is an occasion, and I think one should dress for it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The sort of outre getups, lame jokes and gaffes that make so many Hollywood awards shows cringe-worthy but memorable gave way here to slick costumes and well-rehearsed quips. Most important, the $1.8 million production was on live television, which is why these awards now upstage the more venerable gala of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Only television can command the presence of Ms. Versace, John Galliano and fashion's perennial no-show, Helmut Lang. ''Television and music draw millions of viewers,'' said Tom Ford, who was also there. ''This isn't the kind of event that as a designer you can just take or leave.''</p>
        <p>Despite the predictability of processed cheese, there were surprises: Macy Gray, winning for most fashionable artist, wore not Gucci, nor Versace, but a grommeted jumpsuit by Gary White. She identified him as ''my main man -- he makes all my clothes.''</p>
        <p>And Sir Paul McCartney surprised Stella McCartney, his daughter, by strolling onstage to present her with the Designer of the Year award and enveloping her in a teary embrace.</p>
        <p>More consistent with the evening's self-conscious air, though, was Kid Rock, who scoured his lyrics of the epithets that endear him to potty-mouthed 10-year-olds and dressed for the occasion in a Wal-Mart T-shirt. If it was meant to signal subversion, the gesture backfired, fashionistas instantly assuming it to be just another styling trick. Packaging is the evening's raison d'etre, which was not lost on the two hosts, the exquisitely mismatched Cuba Gooding Jr. and Gisele Bundchen, who in their first costume change appeared in caramel-color ostrich (him) and a sparkling Versace tube top (her). Nor was it missed by Jennifer Lopez, who in accepting the Versace Award, which is given, a Vogue publicist said, for personifying the spirit of music and fashion, thanked Ms. Versace ''for that green dress'' -- the navel-baring sliver of chiffon that made her the most noticed star at last spring's Oscars.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lopez's comments drew titters from the audience, which was otherwise as animated as parishioners at vespers. But during commercial breaks, Ben Stiller filmed background scenes for a coming movie, ''Zoolander'' (based on skits from a previous VH1 Awards night). On cue, spectators cheered and applauded, their energy unflagging in take after take. These were, after all, fashion folk, prepared at any instant to forsake careers of creating glamour behind the scenes for a moment in front of the lens.</p>
