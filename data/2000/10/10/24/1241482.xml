        <p>U.S. to Release Chile Files  The C.I.A. director, George J.

        <p>As Race Tightens, Gore Takes No State for Granted  Vice President Al Gore is devoting virtually his entire week to campaigning in smaller states that he should be able ignore -- even his home state, Tennessee -- instead of scrapping for votes in large swing states like Ohio and Michigan. With only two weeks to go until the election, Mr. Gore's schedule reflects the down-to-the-wire nature of the campaign and the way that factors as disparate as his personality and Ralph Nader's candidacy are playing havoc with the electoral map.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Two daily tracking polls show that Vice President Gore has regained some of the ground he recently lost to Gov. George W. Bush. When four of the polls taken since the last debate are averaged together, Mr. Bush's support is 46 percent, Mr. Gore's 44 percent, Patrick J. Buchanan's 1 percent and Mr. Nader's 4 percent.</p>
        <p>A27</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's stump speech has taken on a new urgency, focusing on what he calls ''the big choices'' -- Social Security, Medicare, health care, education and the economy. His message is that he would use the budget surplus responsibly, with discipline, while his opponent would squander it and drive the nation to ruin.</p>
        <p>A26</p>
        <p>Hitting Back on Social Security  Gov. George W. Bush said Vice President Al Gore's Social Security plan would create about $40 trillion in debt by the middle of the century, saddling future generations with a burden and leaving the system of financing the program unfixed.</p>
        <p>A25</p>
        <p>Governor Bush's campaign undertook one of the most complex and expensive political operations ever, dispatching 28 Republican governors to campaign in 13 contested states.</p>
        <p>A25</p>
        <p>Different Tacks on Political Ads  National and local Democratic officials fanned out to nearly 100 cities in 20 contested states to introduce a video assailing Gov. George W. Bush's record in Texas on matters like air quality, schools, medical care and the poor. The latest Republican campaign advertisements take a much softer tack, with two ads merely reiterating the governor's thoughts and ideas on education.</p>

        <p>Working Families in Majority  The Census Bureau reported that for the first time families in which both parents are working have become the majority (51 percent) even among the most traditional families: married couples with children.</p>

        <p>Cancer Bill Pushed by Lazio To Take Effect Quietly  The White House said President Clinton would privately sign a breast cancer bill that Representative Rick A. Lazio helped push through Congress, rather than hold a public ceremony, which would be the usual practice and was something that advocacy groups sought. But Mr. Lazio, vying with Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Senate, would have had to have been invited. Clinton aides said Mrs. Clinton had also been instrumental in the bill's passage.</p>

        <p>Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton battled over health care, an issue that Lazio aides believe is among Mrs. Clinton's most vulnerable.</p>

        <p>AT&amp;T Breaking Itself Up  The board of AT&amp;T, the largest communications company in the nation, approved a plan to split up the company, its most significant overhaul since the 1984 court-supervised breakup of the Bell System.</p>

        <p>Shake-Up at Lucent  The board of Lucent Technologies, a 1996 AT&amp;T spinoff, ousted its chairman and chief executive, Richard A. McGinn, in a move to curb the earnings erosion that threatens to undermine the world's largest maker of telecommunications equipment. Henry Schacht, Lucent's first chairman and chief executive, will assume that job again.</p>

        <p>Lobbying on High-Tech Issues  Big corporations have enlisted influential lawmakers to tuck provisions into spending bills that could reshape the balance of power among phone companies, Internet companies, broadcasters and cable operators. The measures include a relaxing of restrictions that have made it impossible for AT&amp;T to expand further in the cable industry.</p>
