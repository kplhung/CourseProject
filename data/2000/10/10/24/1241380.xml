        <p>A year ago, Sandy, age 56, could not do any of the floor exercises in her movement class because she was so overweight and out of shape that she had great difficulty getting down to the floor and up again. Even the class's 15-minute walk in the park tired her out before it was over, she recalls.</p>

        <p>A year ago, Sandy, age 56, could not do any of the floor exercises in her movement class because she was so overweight and out of shape that she had great difficulty getting down to the floor and up again. Even the class's 15-minute walk in the park tired her out before it was over, she recalls.</p>
        <p>But now, after working with an instructor who helped her improve her strength and agility, Sandy is participating in all the activities. She recently lost 25 pounds, though she says that at 150 pounds, she is still overweight. But she is far more fit than she used to be and is well on her way to becoming fitter, and leaner.</p>
        <p>At 170 pounds, 23-year-old Laurel describes herself as ''a big girl'' who is also healthy, strong and athletic. As she told Shape magazine earlier this year, she participates in a group cycling class twice a week, uses an elliptical trainer two or three times a week and does strength training five times a week. She says that now she is ''in the best shape'' of her life and happy with who she is ''both on the inside and outside.''</p>
        <p>Randi, 50, is also a big girl. About 300 pounds big. Losing weight has been an elusive, though not yet abandoned, goal. But as a mother of an almost-adolescent, she is determined to remain as healthy as possible despite her weight. So Randi swims five days a week for half an hour, does weight training and yoga two or three times a week and walks a mile to and from work.</p>
        <p>At 17, 300-pound Cheryl Haworth already has the same idea. Though fat since early childhood, she is also remarkably fit, an Olympic weight lifter who can run fast, jump high and do a full split.</p>
        <p>Benefits of Being Fit Though Fat</p>
        <p>A common assumption is that people who are fat cannot possibly be fit. But long-term studies of tens of thousands of people tell a different story. Not only is it possible for those who are overweight or obese to be physically fit, but when the obese become fit, their death rates are about the same as lean people who are not fit. And when a fat person combines regular physical exercise with a sound diet, even if no weight is lost, it is possible to offset the well-established risks, like diabetes and heart disease, associated with being overweight.</p>
        <p>This does not mean it is O.K. to be overweight. A person who is lean and fit still does better in terms of health than someone who is fit but remains fat. But while everyone can't become lean, becoming fit is possible for anyone willing to make the effort.</p>
        <p>Dr. C. Wayne Callaway, an endocrinologist and weight specialist at George Washington University, insists: ''We've been far too hung up on weight. I'd much rather see a heavy person who's physically active in my office than a skinny person who's completely out of shape.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Steven N. Blair, a fitness researcher at the Cooper Institute in Dallas, who has had a lifelong struggle with weight, reports that adhering to an American Heart Association low-fat diet and regularly running some 30 miles a week did not prevent him from gradually gaining 25 pounds in the last two decades. But in terms of physical fitness he is in the top few percent of men his age, 61.</p>
        <p>''I may be short, fat and bald, but I'm fit,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And, based on recent findings of a long-term study of 25,000 men tested at the Cooper Institute, no matter what a person's body weight, physical fitness can protect against premature death. The risk of premature death for men who were obese but fit was only a third that of unfit obese men.</p>
        <p>And, those who were obese but fit had death rates about the same as lean and fit men, though the risk of dying of heart disease was 60 percent greater for the obese. A previous institute study suggests that the findings also apply to women.</p>
        <p>Fitness can even overcome the health hazards associated with having a large belly. Excess weight there is associated with a significantly increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. But in another Cooper Institute study, of 20,000 men, those who were fit had similar death rates regardless of their abdomen sizes, while death rates were twice as great among men without excess abdominal fat who were not physically fit.</p>
        <p>Fitness usually refers to a person's aerobic capacity -- the ability of the heart, lungs and circulatory system to supply oxygen-rich blood to muscles and organs and remove metabolic waste products during physical exertion. It is typically measured by having a person exercise on a treadmill while heart rate and breathing capacity are recorded.</p>
        <p>The longer a person can last on the treadmill as the elevation and sometimes the speed are increased -- or, rather, the closer one comes to maximum oxygen-moving capacity for one's age and gender -- the fitter the person is rated. The Cooper Institute studies showed that increasing fitness was life-saving; for each minute of improvement in time on the treadmill, the risk of early death dropped by nearly 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Muscle strength represents another kind of fitness. In a continuing study among the 8,000 Japanese-American men in the Honolulu Heart Program, those with the greatest grip strength have had the lowest risk of death from all causes over a 30-year period regardless of how much they weighed.</p>
        <p>What Fitness Means</p>
        <p>In practical terms, fitness means you can climb stairs or carry heavy packages or run for a bus without getting out of breath. The fitter you are, the less strain there is on your cardiovascular system when you exert yourself. Fitness is also associated with more normal blood pressure, blood cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and those positive factors reduce the risk of developing hypertension, atherosclerosis or diabetes.</p>
        <p>Fitness can be improved through regular physical activity. Ideally, that involves doing an aerobic activity at 60 percent to 85 percent of one's cardiovascular capacity for at least 20 minutes at a time, three or four times a week. The kinds of activities that enhance fitness include jogging, brisk walking, cycling, swimming laps, aerobic dancing and similar activities that increase one's breathing rate and can be sustained for 20 or more minutes at a time.</p>
        <p>The Honolulu findings suggest that strength training -- weight-lifting or working out on resistance machines -- can also contribute to fitness, though such activities do not increase the exercise capacity of the heart and lungs.</p>
        <p>But for people who are out of shape, fitness experts say significant benefits can also accrue from doing an aerobic activity like brisk walking for 10 minutes, three or more times a day. This allows many people to improve fitness by incorporating short bouts of exercise into their daily schedules if they find regular, longer session physically or mentally difficult to schedule.</p>
        <p>Such activities may include raking the lawn, pushing the lawn mower, whacking weeds, walking briskly to and from a bus stop or train station, scrubbing the floor, splitting logs or sawing wood by hand, carrying groceries home from the store or pushing children in a stroller.</p>
        <p>Most of these activities also increase muscle strength, which can enhance the ability to lose excess weight by raising the metabolic rate every minute of the day.</p>
