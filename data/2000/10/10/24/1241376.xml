        <p>''Open wide. A little wider, please. Very good. Now say 'cheese.' ''</p>
        <p>The first part will sound familiar to virtually anyone who has sat in a dentist's chair, but probably not the second. That may change if a new technique proves effective. The procedure seeks to spot incipient cavities using high intensity light and a tiny camera.</p>
        <p>Dentists meeting at an American Dental Association conference in Chicago this month were told that the method, under study by Dr. George K. Stookey of the Indiana University School of Dentistry, could make it easier to spot cavities before they do any harm.</p>
        <p>In a description released by the association, Dr. Stookey, a professor of preventive dentistry, said a dentist could focus the light in the patient's mouth, using a device similar in size to the instruments used to clean teeth.</p>
        <p>If a tooth has lost calcium or phosphate because of caries, the disease that leads to cavities, it will reflect the light differently, and a camera will record the change and relay the information to a computer.</p>
        <p>If the dentist believes a tooth is developing a cavity, the patient will be asked to come back in a few months, and new pictures will be taken to see if more decalcification has occurred.</p>
        <p>Dentists now use X-rays and visual inspection to look for cavities, but by the time they spot trouble, there can already be a lot of damage.</p>
        <p>With the new technique, dentists may be able to detect cavities early enough that they can be treated without the need for a filling, Dr. Stookey said. This can be done  several ways, including by remineralization or with a sealant.</p>
        <p>He said he hoped to be able to make the equipment available to dentists in a year or two.</p>
