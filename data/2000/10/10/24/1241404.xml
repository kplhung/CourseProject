        <p>One solution, although not an answer to the immediate crisis, is to recruit young people into the teaching profession who are experts in these communities and who are vested in improving things. New York's neighborhoods have a bounty of bright, articulate teenagers.

        <p>Those of us in community health education have long known that to provide education to improve the health of a community, we must work in tandem with community leaders, guided by their knowledge and expertise. The same no doubt holds true for general educators.</p>
