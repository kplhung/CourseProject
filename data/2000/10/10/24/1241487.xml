        <p>The replays of Roger Clemens hurling a bat past Mike Piazza in Game 2 of the Subway Series exacerbated the anger and frustration of the Mets yesterday, as some of them spoke of the Yankees' pitcher with a derision barely contained.</p>
        <p>But over all, the Mets were restrained, including Piazza. They have no time for feuding, they have no time for distraction.</p>
        <p>The Yankees won the first two games of the World Series and could bury the Mets in this four-of-seven-game series tonight if they win Game 3 at Shea Stadium, where Orlando Hernandez -- who has never lost a post-season game -- pitches against the Mets' Rick Reed.</p>
        <p>Al Leiter and Mike Hampton, the Mets' two best pitchers, started the first two games, and the Yankees' veterans sprayed hits all over Yankee Stadium and won both games.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, who slumped for nearly a month before they exploded for seven runs in the eighth inning of Game 2 of the American League Championship Series, are back to doing what made them so successful: patiently waiting for pitches to hit, flooding the bases with runners, putting the ball in play, relentlessly picking away at the Mets' pitching.</p>
        <p>And in Hernandez, the Mets face a daunting rival. He has pitched in 10 post-season games and the Yankees have won all 10. He is bothered by a bit of a cold; the night air is expected to be chilly and Hernandez sometimes has trouble gripping his slider in those conditions. But he is usually dominant in his October starts.</p>
        <p>''He loves to compete; he loves the post-season, or whatever he is,'' said Paul O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder. ''He's just been a go-to guy this time of year.''</p>
        <p>Facing an opponent that imposing, the Mets are in no position to dwell on anything other than how to beat El Duque.</p>
        <p>''I still don't know what to think,'' Mets reliever John Franco said of the Clemens-Piazza incident. ''But the important thing is that we have to come out tomorrow and play good baseball and get back in this thing.''</p>
        <p>Major League Baseball still has some questions about the incident in Game 2. Frank Robinson, baseball's enforcement officer, opened an inquiry into the matter yesterday, speaking with officials from both teams, and he is expected to interview Clemens sometime this week.</p>
        <p>Before the Yankees' workout at Shea Stadium, Clemens repeated what he said immediately after Game 2, that he initially thought Piazza's bat was a baseball, and that when he realized he was holding the bat head, he fired it toward the on-deck circle, not realizing that Piazza was moving up the baseline.</p>
        <p>''I was a little fired up,'' Clemens said. ''This is the World Series.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' Todd Zeile said, ''His excuse that he thought it was a baseball was as ridiculous as I've ever heard.''</p>
        <p>Piazza said he hoped that baseball would examine Clemens's actions, but also said, ''I just really think it's important to move on at this point.''</p>
        <p>Yankees Manager Joe Torre made two surprising relatively surprising decisions yesterday. Jose Vizcaino, the hero of Game 1, will start at second base and lead-off, rather than Chuck Knoblauch, who hasn't played in the field in more than three weeks. There had been signals for days that David Cone would start Game 4 for the Yankees, but when Torre finally decided, he chose Denny Neagle.</p>
        <p>Bobby Valentine, the Mets' manager, said he is considering lineup changes for Game 3. Left-handed batters have been more effective than right-handed batters against Hernandez, and the Mets' lineup, as usually constructed, has only two left-handed hitters: third baseman Robin Ventura and the right fielder Timo Perez. Valentine could start the left-handed-hitting Darryl Hamilton in place of left fielder Benny Agbayani, although Valentine has great trust in Agbayani.</p>
        <p>The Mets' wealth of left-handed pitching was expected to be their biggest advantage in this series, against a Yankee lineup that is heavy with left-handed hitters and switch hitters. But O'Neill, Tino Martinez and David Justice went 7 for 17 against left-handed pitchers in the first two games, hitting outside pitches to the opposite field and pulling inside pitches to right, and that threesome has driven home half of the Yankees' runs.</p>
        <p>''When it comes down to clutch hits, those are the guys you want at the plate,'' Hamilton said. ''They've hurt us. I've talked about it from Day 1, that the plus on our ball club was our left-handed pitching getting out their left-handed hitters. The first two games, we didn't get them out, so we've got to find a way to change that.''</p>
        <p>Reed would not appear to match up as well against the Yankees' lineup as Leiter or Hampton. He is right-handed and has a tendency to give up lots of hits and homers. But the Yankees have not faced Reed this year, and he is the type of pitcher who can give the Yankees' problems, if he has good control. If he can get ahead in the count, Reed can change speeds and work both sides of the plate and hide his mediocre stuff, and the Yankees cannot be as patient as they were in the first two games. But if Reed struggles to throw strikes, the Yankees could hammer him.</p>
        <p>Before Game 1 at Yankee Stadium, Reed looked around the field and gawked at all the news media, chuckling at the spectacle of the World Series. His parents had never flown, but yesterday, they boarded a plane in West Virginia, to come to New York to see their son pitch.</p>
        <p>Reed has pitched well in big games before, and the Mets desperately need a strong performance from him. ''I've got to keep them off the board, hopefully,'' Reed said. ''Just give our team a chance to win.''</p>
        <p>Reed said he doesn't care to think about Hernandez's record, just as all of the Mets are trying to forget about the most recent Clemens-Piazza incident. There is something else hanging over the Mets, as well, that was evident in some of their asides after Game 2, and before yesterday's workout. They feel they were largely unlucky in Yankee Stadium, with Lenny Harris and Zeile twice missing home runs by inches, with the Yankees scoring runs with broken-bat hits and bloops.</p>
        <p>Zeile said: ''They're not necessarily having better at-bats than we are. The results are better. Unfortunately, sometimes that's the way it is. You can look at it, good at-bats or bad at-bats, but the bottom line is the results.''</p>
        <p>The Mets will be standing on the bottom line tonight.</p>
