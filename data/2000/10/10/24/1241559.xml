        <p>Did the Yankees really adopt pinstripes because they made Babe Ruth look slimmer? Not really. But just because the oft-told story is a canard doesn't mean ballplayers are outside fashion's ineluctable pull. Just check out El Duque's dark knee socks. Miuccia Prada showed that look for Spring 2001.</p>
        <p>For most of pro baseball's history, it has been a sartorial sinkhole. The hot, itchy (and hardly flattering) wool flannel knickers of the 1870's held on well into the early 20th century, later morphing into Dacron, and then the double-knits that now make Benny Agbayani look like a package of link sausage and Derek Jeter like a calendar boy for trophy buns.</p>

        <p>For most of pro baseball's history, it has been a sartorial sinkhole. The hot, itchy (and hardly flattering) wool flannel knickers of the 1870's held on well into the early 20th century, later morphing into Dacron, and then the double-knits that now make Benny Agbayani look like a package of link sausage and Derek Jeter like a calendar boy for trophy buns.</p>
        <p>Despite the unfortunate ubiquity of ball caps in all settings, baseball clothes were not always considered cool. The 1970's, it is generally agreed, were the nadir: garish colors, self-belted trousers, outlandish patches and a general departure from conservativism. As anyone watching the World Series can see, the traditional uniform is back, pared down, in classic stripes (Yankees) or with an overshirt (Mets) that is the only permissible dash of color on the field.</p>
        <p>The return to old-style uniforms follows a larger trend, best evidenced in the 12 stadiums built over the last decade that favor, as Eric Enders, a researcher at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., said, ''retro elements. Uniforms are minimalist and, Mr. Enders said, ''less fashion,'' which is to say they're more fashion than ever before.</p>
