        <p>Center Kevin Mawae had seen enough. All around him during the Jets' game against Miami last night was ugliness. The offense had gained 9 total yards after the opening quarter. The defense missed a good half-dozen tackles in the first half. There were false starts, two illegal-formation penalties and personal-foul miscues. The Jets were being outhit, outplayed and outcoached.</p>
        <p>So Mawae, one of the team's stand-up players and one of the great leaders in football, gathered the offense together on the sideline while the Jets' defense was on the field. He began screaming at his teammates, begging them really. It was easy to read his lips during one part of his rant: ''We're not going out like this.''</p>

        <p>So Mawae, one of the team's stand-up players and one of the great leaders in football, gathered the offense together on the sideline while the Jets' defense was on the field. He began screaming at his teammates, begging them really. It was easy to read his lips during one part of his rant: ''We're not going out like this.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, after a multitude of horrible plays and some of the worst football the Jets have played in years, they started the improbable comeback. What the Jets accomplished, coming back from a 30-7, fourth-quarter deficit, to tie the score at 30-30 with under five minutes remaining in the game, eventually sending the game into overtime, 37-37, and then winning it, was nothing short of miraculous.</p>
        <p>Most of us football experts in the news media expected a low-scoring, ugly game. But on the way to a defensive struggle a shootout happened.</p>
        <p>Jets 40, Miami 37.</p>
        <p>What a game. It will go down as one of the best regular-season contests in league history.</p>
        <p>More importantly, the Jets now lead the American Football Conference East with a 6-1 record and must be considered among the top teams in the conference. Quite simply, the Jets are a Super Bowl team.</p>
        <p>The Jets showed remarkable courage but committed a multitude of sins that left them in a tremendous hole early.</p>
        <p>They made running back Lamar Smith look like Walter Payton.</p>
        <p>Miami wide receivers Oronde Gadsden and Leslie Shepherd -- hardly Duper and Clayton -- made big catch after big catch.</p>
        <p>The Jets were beaten up by quarterback Jay Fiedler, for goodness sake.</p>
        <p>Dolphins Coach Dave Wannstedt, who was called a dolt when he was in Chicago, formulated a brilliant game plan on both sides of the ball, catching the Jets napping with multiple deep throws and shutting down those short crossing routes Jets receivers normally feast upon. All Coach Al Groh could do was stand there ashen-faced as the disastrous first three quarters unfolded. His Jets looked completely unprepared.</p>
        <p>And did I mention Fiedler was quarterbacking? You can't stop that Fiedler; you can only hope to contain him.</p>
        <p>The encouraging thing for the Jets is that this team has fight like no other in football, as this is their fourth comeback this season. Testaverde was brilliant in the fourth quarter. The Jets consistently, late in the game, were able to spring one receiver, and Testaverde zeroed in on him. Many times it was running back Curtis Martin. And you know Testaverde's ailing pinched nerve had to be bothering him.</p>
        <p>He started out the game with three interceptions but ended up tossing five touchdown passes.</p>
        <p>And the Jets' coaching staff deserves a tremendous amount of credit for one of the more gutsy calls ever. Trailing by a touchdown, Groh called for Jumbo Elliott, yes, an offensive lineman, to make the game-tying touchdown catch with less than a minute left. Elliott made sure he got the football from the ball boy for his trophy case. Can't blame him for that. That play will go down not just in Jets history, but National Football League lore.</p>
        <p>Groh is a solid coach, and he learned a valuable lesson. The early lackadaisical approach of the team against the best defense in the division is a shocking dereliction of duty. Groh did not have his team prepared, but the good news is he shouldn't ever be caught so flat-footed again.</p>
        <p>And Miami did expose a flaw with this team. The Jets have no consistent downfield passing game. Martin is the offense, and while the Jets will make the playoffs, they will not go far unless Testaverde can stretch the field.</p>
        <p>Miami stacked the line of scrimmage with seven and sometimes eight defenders while cornerbacks Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison covered the Jets wide receivers one on one.</p>
        <p>All Keyshawn Johnson bashers take note: the Jets have no receiving threat to make teams pay for using that tactic. Not Chrebet. Not Ward. Not Laveranues Coles. Johnson used to toy with the smaller Miami cornerbacks, shoving them around, or beating them with big plays in the middle of the field.</p>
        <p>The Jets are basically paying the price for not doing what almost everyone in the league thought they should have done this past off-season: sign a speedy free-agent wide out.</p>
        <p>But enough of the negative. This is one of those rare times when both teams actually win, because both played so hard. We have seen some bizarre things from the Jets this season, a halfback option from Martin to beat Tampa Bay, among others, but this game ranks among the most thrilling in the team's history.</p>
        <p>So maybe the team listened to Mawae after all.</p>
        <p>Lucky they did.</p>
        <p>What a game.</p>
