        <p>Mr. Rothstein suggests that the answer to helping poor children succeed is not in giving them a middle-class education where they live but in getting them into middle-class suburbs, which are more likely to have better schools.</p>

        <p>Re ''Offering Poor an Alternative to Vouchers,'' by Richard Rothstein (Lessons column, Oct. 18):</p>
        <p>Mr. Rothstein suggests that the answer to helping poor children succeed is not in giving them a middle-class education where they live but in getting them into middle-class suburbs, which are more likely to have better schools.</p>
        <p>Yet there are thriving communities where there was once poverty in many urban areas precisely because of school improvements. School choice not only gives poor parents the ability to buy up; it also gives school professionals more respect and choice, and communities embrace the choices that succeed.</p>
        <p>Public schools in middle-class neighborhoods aren't something to crow about either. Some of our largest declines in education have been in suburban schools.</p>
