        <p>After more than four weeks of arguing over details, lawyers for Sotheby's and Christie's and customers suing the auction giants for price-fixing are close to signing a $512 million civil settlement, a lawyer told an impatient federal judge yesterday. With no sign of the final papers since the parties reported reaching agreement Sept. 22, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan called both sides into his Manhattan courtroom yesterday to say that without a formal settlement they faced a February trial date. Richard Drubel of Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner, lead counsel for the class of more than 100,000 customers who say they were cheated by collusive practices, told the judge he expected a final agreement ''within 48 hours.''</p>
