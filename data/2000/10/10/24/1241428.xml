        <p>A nearly six-month strike by thousands of actors who appear in television commercials was tentatively resolved today, ending a bitter labor dispute that involved issues ranging from pay in commercials on cable programs to advertisements on the Internet.</p>
        <p>The walkout was the longest and one of the most fractious talent strikes in the history of Hollywood. It raised issues and set the stage, in some ways, for a far bigger labor confrontation planned next summer against film studios and television networks by actors as well as writers. Studios and networks are already in high gear making films and television shows before the threatened strike could shut down the entire entertainment industry.</p>
        <p>In agreeing to end the strike, the advertisers settled several demands made by the two unions representing the actors. One of the demands was a near doubling over three years in the maximum flat fees paid to actors in commercials on cable television.</p>
        <p>The advertisers also dropped their resistance to recognizing the jurisdiction of the unions for commercials that run on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Representatives of two unions, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, announced the tentative end of the strike against advertisers following prolonged talks at the Millennium Hotel in Manhattan. The boards of both unions are set to endorse the agreement on Saturday, and the full memberships will vote shortly after that. A Screen Actors Guild official said that commercial actors could be working again as early as next week.</p>
        <p>''All of us realize that for our common good it was time to end this strike,'' said William Daniels, an actor who is president of the Screen Actors Guild. Anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 actors who earn a significant portion of their incomes making commercials were affected by the strike, which received financial support in recent months from such millionaire stars as Harrison Ford, Nicolas Cage, Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey, Eddie Murphy and Bruce Willis. About 40 percent of the striking commercial actors live in New York, the Screen Actors Guild said.</p>
        <p>At stake in the strike, which began May 1, were several issues. One of them was the rate of pay for actors who make commercials for cable programs. Actors, as well as writers, have long insisted that they had accepted less money for cable advertisements to help the cable industry establish itself. In recent years, though, the actors felt that now-profitable and lucrative cable stations were essentially exploiting them.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, actors would be paid a steady increase of fees for commercials on cable television. The deal stipulates that an actor's fees climb from a maximum of $1,360 in the first year of the contract to $1,706 in the second year and $2,460 in the third year. These maximum amounts are paid to an actor every quarter if an advertisement appears during that time. Currently actors making commercials receive a maximum $1,014 each quarter.</p>
        <p>Another issue involved the unions' insistence that they have jurisdiction over ads using actors on the Internet. ''Frankly, they wanted to cut us out  by not granting us jurisdiction for commercials to be made on the Internet,'' said Greg Krizman, a spokesman for the Screen Actors Guild. ''Depending whom you talk to, that's potentially the fastest point of growth for the ad industry.''</p>
        <p>The advertisers seem to have bowed to the unions on the Internet issue. Ira M. Shepard, a Washington lawyer who was chief negotiator for the advertisers, said that ''we hammered out a fair compromise so the union would have limited jurisdiction in the future over commercials made exclusively for the Internet.'' He said that it was still unclear to what degree the Net would be used in employing actors to advertise products.</p>
        <p>The strike had a definite impact on the economy of Los Angeles, where many of the commercials are filmed. Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit group, estimated direct financial losses of about $125 million. Moreover, there was an additional business loss of $103 million because the strike also affected such businesses as catering.</p>
        <p>There had been speculation recently that the strike would be settled during this round of talks, which began in New York on Thursday. The Screen Actors Guild was under increasing pressure to resolve the strike, partly because of heightened restiveness by actors toward the union's leadership.</p>
        <p>The impact of the strike was visible and audible because familiar faces and voices were honoring the picket lines and not making commercials. For instance, Anheuser-Busch had planned to produce more commercials in the popular ''Whassup!'' series for Budweiser beer, but the actors who play the friends in the spots would not work during the strike, so during the Olympics and baseball playoffs the company reran old spots in the series. Coca-Cola had planned to start running a new campaign for Diet Coke, carrying the theme ''Live it up. Drink it down,'' but had to postpone the introduction of the commercials.</p>
        <p>And Burger King was hampered in producing new spots because Kathleen Turner, who has been the voice in the chain's current campaign, honored the strike; a replacement voice was required.</p>
        <p>Watching high-profile TV shows like the Olympics, baseball playoffs, N.F.L. games, it seemed there were fewer new commercials and more spots were being rerun over and over, perhaps because of limited output of new spots with union talent.</p>
        <p>During the strike, however, the Joint Policy Committee on Broadcast Talent Union Relations, as the coalition of advertisers and agencies  negotiating with the unions is known, disseminated data that showed production was ''virtually unimpeded,'' as the committee described it, by the strike. Many commercials were shot with nonunion talent, while others were moved to Canada or Mexico or overseas to shoot.</p>
        <p>The commercial strike, the longest in the history of actors' unions, had a public side to it as well. The striking actors recently asked consumers to begin boycotting three products made by one of the big advertisers, the Procter &amp; Gamble Company, in an effort to apply pressure to the advertisers and agencies. Forty-four cast members of two soap operas produced by P.&amp; G., ''As the World Turns'' and ''Guiding Light,'' sent a letter to Alan G. Lafley, the company's president and chief executive, urging him to help bring a ''speedy resolution'' to the strike.</p>
