        <p>With the clock ticking to Election Day, Vice President Al Gore's stump speech has taken on a new urgency.</p>
        <p>Gone are his leisurely strolls down memory lane; long absent is the once standard story of his father showing him slave chains in an old house in Tennessee. Gone is the fascination with suburban sprawl and traffic jams and lost luggage at airports, the focus on the hassles of daily life that threatened to turn the presidential campaign into a contest for the local zoning board. And, now that the three official debates are over and Mr. Gore has emerged in a weaker position than when he went into them, gone is his constant clamor for two or three debates a week. Gone too are the jokes, if not the humor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is now focused almost single-mindedly on what he calls ''the big choices'': Social Security, Medicare, health care, education and the economy. He has boiled his message down to its essence, a math problem, basically, that in his view has only one right answer: Mr. Gore would use the budget surplus responsibly, with discipline, while Gov. George W. Bush would squander it and drive the nation to ruin.</p>
        <p>''Prosperity itself is on the ballot,'' Mr. Gore declares now in his most succinct argument for his candidacy. Coupled with this is a phrase that Governor Bush used against him in their first debate and that Mr. Gore has appropriated with great glee. ''Fuzzy math!'' Mr. Gore often shouts as he picks apart Mr. Bush's proposals for a tax cut and privatizing part of Social Security. ''Fuzzy math!'' To the disciplined Mr. Gore, this is a huge failing, and it seems to stick in his craw that Mr. Bush used it against him first.</p>
        <p>The new urgency was evident here on Saturday night, in a high school gymnasium so stuffy that the formal Mr. Gore rolled up his shirt sleeves and mopped his face with a white handkerchief as he delivered in a crisp 18 minutes the essentials of his message. The crowd of several hundred people was cheering most of the time and the acoustics were terrible, circumstances that forced the often wordy Mr. Gore to cut short his tendencies to overinstruct an audience and speak in run-on sentences.</p>
        <p>The larger circumstances -- Governor Bush's tiny lead in the polls, the nearness of Election Day, the demands on his dwindling time -- also forced him into a more direct message, leaving behind the desultory ramble through the high points of his parents' careers to a sharp and urgent plea for help on the eve of the closest presidential race in 40 years.</p>
        <p>This often happens over the course of a long campaign, although few have seemed as long as this one. A candidate spends the primary season introducing himself, uses his convention to define his themes and presses those themes through the fall. For Mr. Gore, this was a lengthy process that included a bitter primary battle against a left-leaning challenger, former Senator Bill Bradley, who forced the vice president to take more liberal positions than he might otherwise have.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Gore, the process has highlighted his search for both an identity and a message. His changing stump speech is a manifestation of that search.</p>
        <p>All year Mr. Gore has been trying to sort out how to take credit for the economy without bragging and without casting himself as President Clinton's eclipsed No. 2. He lays out the facts as he has all year, saying: ''We've turned the biggest deficits into the biggest surpluses. Instead of triple-dip recessions, we've seen a tripling of the stock market. Instead of high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American unemployment ever measured, the lowest Latino unemployment ever measured, 22 million new jobs and the strongest economy in the 224-year history of the United States of America.''</p>
        <p>But now he adds a twist designed to separate himself from Mr. Clinton and propel his candidacy into the future instead of the past: ''But I'm not satisfied,'' he bellows. ''You ain't seen nothing yet!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has also dropped most references to himself. After months of ''introducing'' himself to the public, Mr. Gore is spending these final frantic weeks insisting that the race is about issues, not about personality. ''This is not about me and it's not about Governor Bush,'' he says in nearly every speech. ''It is about you and your family.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Gore emerged from his vice presidential shell, he was forced into a public search for a personal narrative to explain who he was and where he came from. For months, he dwelled on stories about his parents, whose up-from-the-hollers grit seemed more inspirational than the facts of Mr. Gore's own life, in which the drama was internal and the journey abstract.</p>
        <p>He talked about climbing Mount Rainier with his son, an arduous experience that he translated on the campaign trail into vague thoughts about scanning the horizon. Another staple was a line from the movie, ''Grand Canyon,'' in which a character says, ''It's not supposed to be this way.'' Mr. Gore often quoted Gandhi, saying, ''You must become the change you wish to see in the world.'' Another favorite was a line from the Spanish poet Antonio Machado: ''Traveler, there is no path. You make your path as you travel.''</p>
        <p>These expressions were supposed to provide a glimpse into the sensitive side of Mr. Gore. But they added up to an existential question mark rather than a rationale for why he should be president.</p>
        <p>In these final urgent days, the elaborate scaffolding that Mr. Gore had constructed to help build his identity has fallen away. Now, he relates only essential biographical facts that serve a direct purpose.</p>
        <p>He went to Vietnam, i.e., he did not pull strings to avoid the war. He was a journalist, i.e., he has not spent his entire life in a blue suit in Washington. He has been married for 30 years and has four children, i.e., he is a devoted family man who will spare the nation any Clintonian lapses.</p>
        <p>Distancing himself from Mr. Clinton is a subtext of Mr. Gore's speech. He almost never mentions the president's name, but evokes him nonetheless by promising: ''I won't always be the most exciting politician, but I will work hard for you every single day, and I will never let you down.''</p>
        <p>What Mr. Gore has kept in his speech and what he has discarded is a response in part to changing political realities. In the primaries, for example, he would say that Mr. Bradley had not been a good Democrat. (Mr. Gore complained that Mr. Bradley ''quit'' the Senate after the Republicans took over and considered challenging the incumbent Democratic president, Mr. Clinton, in 1996.) Now that he is trying to win over independents and moderate Republicans, Mr. Gore tells audiences that he himself had a reputation in Congress as someone who worked across party lines. With this in mind, he has toned down the raging populism of early September. While he remains an advocate of abortion rights, he has begun to speak of seeking ''common ground'' with abortion opponents.</p>
        <p>The changing stump speech is also a reflection of what has worked and what has not. Mr. Gore has stopped branding Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposal a ''risky tax scheme,'' a phrase his top advisers concluded sounded too cliched and too harsh. He has also given up his promise for ''revolutionary change'' in education, a concept that left audiences more puzzled than energized. But he has not abandoned his assertion that ''we need to make education our No. 1 priority.''</p>
        <p>His biggest applause line now is one he hit on in late summer. ''I will make college affordable'' with a tax credit. And his most enduring are these: ''It's time to treat teachers like the professionals they are,'' and ''It's time to take the medical decisions away from the bean counters who sit behind computer terminals and play God.''</p>
        <p>Since ''Saturday Night Live'' made fun of him after the first debate for using the arcane word ''lockbox'' to describe where he would put the Social Security trust fund, Mr. Gore has been more self-conscious about the word. ''Use whatever word you want,'' he will say, but he will often fall back on lockbox.</p>
        <p>Topics that once loomed large have vanished altogether. He used to talk at length about gun control, pledging to make an issue of Mr. Bush's having signed a bill to allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons to church. But pro-gun commercials in hunter-heavy swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan have forced him to scale back. Now, as he did in the debates, Mr. Gore emphasizes that he does not want to take firearms away from sportsmen.</p>
        <p>In Philadelphia, his only reference to guns was that he wanted schools to be ''gun-free'' and ''violence-free.''</p>
