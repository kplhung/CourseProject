        <p>The Spanish banking company Banco Santander Central Hispano announced that it had abandoned talks with Commerzbank of Germany on raising its stake in Commerzbank from 5.1 percent, to 10 percent. A spokesman for Commerzbank told Spanish reporters that the negotiations had foundered over differences on fixing the value of CC-Bank, which is owned by Banco Santander and specializes in automobile financing in Germany. Banco Santander would have traded CC-Bank and cash for the additional 4.9 percent stake in Commerzbank. Analysts said Commerzbank had hoped a larger stake for Banco Santander would help fend off a hostile bid from Cobra, a German investment group, which is the bank's major shareholder with 17 percent.</p>
