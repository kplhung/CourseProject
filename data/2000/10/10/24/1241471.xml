        <p>Hundreds of Americans were tending to their business today at senior centers, in restaurants and on factory floors around the country when teams of Republican governors suddenly swept into their midst, stumping for a colleague, George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Betty Runzauer was shopping at Winship's Pharmacy here when four governors burst in the door, and she was momentarily speechless.</p>
        <p>''I think Christie Whitman just came into our drugstore,'' she said to her husband, Cy. ''And there's Jeb Bush. But who are those other guys?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Runzauer, who retired to Florida from Bloomfield, N.J., had recognized the governors of New Jersey and Florida but had not made out Edward T. Schafer of North Dakota or Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania. It didn't matter. Before long, she was happily chatting with both about the high cost of prescription drugs, and getting a detailed education on the Republican ticket's plan to pay for them.</p>
        <p>The same scene was repeated in 13 other contested states today as the Bush presidential campaign rolled out one of the most complex and expensive political operations ever undertaken. Acting on the popularity of many governors and the perception that they are Washington outsiders, the campaign hired private jets for seven teams of them (at prices that approached $5,000 an hour per aircraft), found places for them to speak and arranged for drivers to ferry them and restaurants to feed them. In all, 28 of Mr. Bush's fellow Republican governors joined the effort; only Cecil H. Underwood of West Virginia, running hard in his own race, for re-election, did not.</p>
        <p>''It's pretty much been day and night for weeks, setting it all up,'' said an exhausted Joyce Gates, the ''captain'' of Team 5, which included the three governors who joined Jeb Bush in Florida today and their individual security details.</p>
        <p>Some crowds were already so completely Republican that not a single mind needed changing, as was the case when Team 5 dropped by senior centers in Fort Myers and in the Little Havana section of Miami. But that was not really the point, as Governor Whitman explained.</p>
        <p>''The whole thing here is to get local media,'' she said after addressing an adoring crowd at Marriott's enormous Calusa Harbor senior residence in Fort Myers. ''It's not rallies, it's not necessarily to speak to huge groups, but it's to get in the local press, so the message gets out to everyone, far greater than any individual rally.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, on their three stops today the members of Team 5 encountered dozens of reporters for regional and local newspapers and television and radio stations. And some gave individual interviews to radio talk shows and national television networks.</p>
        <p>The division of labor was for the most part constant: Ms. Whitman talked about tax cuts, Mr. Ridge about education, and Mr. Schafer about Social Security and prescription drug plans. Jeb Bush, who accompanied the tour on only one stop, in Palm Beach, talked about his brother's learning curve.</p>
        <p>''A neighborhood drugstore like this is the heartbeat of this community,'' he said, standing in the middle of Winship's, where all business had come to a halt as about 30 customers gathered round. ''You go to barbershops and drugstores, you hear the best advice and what the concerns are. And after you listen -- and this is the sign of a good leader -- you're better able to solve problems. My brother has learned to do this as governor of the state of Texas, and that's what we need in Washington, a little more humility, people willing to listen to the concerns of others.''</p>
        <p>For the most part, the governors on the Florida trip kept their criticism of the Democrats gentle. But a few on other teams went a bit further.</p>
        <p>''We've been looking for an energy policy for the last eight years from the Clinton-Gore administration, and there isn't one,'' said Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut, speaking at a gas station just outside Philadelphia, where Team 1 had been dispatched. ''In fact, I sometimes think Saddam Hussein is running the oil policy for this administration.''</p>
        <p>Speaking at Atlas Machine, a manufacturer of air compressors in Louisville, Ky., Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia accused the administration of being ''antiworker,'' because, he said, Vice President Al Gore's tax plan would not return enough money to the middle class.</p>
        <p>Many of the governors happily echoed Mr. Bush's belief that they are more respected around the country than other politicians, particularly the ones who work in Washington. In fact, an important theme of the three-day Barnstorm for Reform tour, which will reach 25 states in all, was to play up the hard-charging, problem-solving persona of the state executive. The campaign clearly hopes that this image will embrace Mr. Bush, even though the governor's office in Texas is one of the nation's least powerful.</p>
        <p>''Governors are leaders of their states, and have to solve very complex problems,'' Mr. Ridge said. ''We have the responsibility of bringing people together, and we need a leader who can bring people together as well.''</p>
        <p>Left unsaid were many of the policy differences between factions of Republican governors. Mr. Ridge and Ms. Whitman support abortion rights, for instance, and Mr. Bush opposes it.</p>
        <p>Many of the governors have known each other as friends for years, and the members of the Florida team seemed delighted to have an excuse to spend time in the warm sun, away from their Northern states. The day's liveliest moment occurred at the Little Havana Activities and Nutrition Center, a senior center in the heart of Miami's solidly Republican Cuban community. As the governors entered, scores of older Cuban-Americans were dancing to timbals and singing ''Guantanamera''; the governors did their best to join in.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Whitman and Mr. Schafer spoke only limited Spanish, and Mr. Ridge seemed to speak none, while many in the crowd spoke no English. So it was left to Al Cardenas, chairman of the Florida Republican Party, to translate the governors' remarks.</p>
        <p>Many in the crowd cared only that the politicians on the stage were speaking against the Democrats. ''It doesn't matter to me what state they're from,'' Maria Roldos said.  ''There's not one Cuban in this state who's going to vote for the administration that returned that child to Cuba,'' she said, referring to Elian Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ridge tried a bit of Spanish, repeating the crowd's refrain of ''Clinton-Gore, adios!'' But at times he seemed a bit mystified by the intensity and single-mindedness of a group of Miamians he had traveled so far to meet.</p>
        <p>''Sprechen Sie Deutsch?'' he asked at one point. ''Get me to a German community, and I'll do all right.''</p>
