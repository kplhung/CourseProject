        <p>The results in Sunday's presidential election were delayed without explanation today, and Ivoirians expressed fears that the military government was trying to manipulate the outcome.</p>
        <p>After early results this morning showed the junta leader, Gen. Robert Guei, trailing his main opponent by 11 percentage points, soldiers took over the offices of the National Electoral Commission.</p>
        <p>Later this evening, a newscaster on state television said the Commission had no announcement to make. Final results were expected today.</p>
        <p>According to the official partial results announced before the blackout, General Guei won 40 percent of the ballots counted, about 8 percent of total cast. But his main rival, Laurent Gbagbo, a longtime opposition leader and the leader of the smallest of Ivory Coast's three main parties, had 51 percent. A candidate would have to receive more than 50 percent of the votes to avoid a runoff.</p>
        <p>But at a news conference this morning, Mr. Gbagbo said he had won nearly 62 percent of the votes, compared with 26 percent for General Guei. He based his announcement on his party's tallies from half of the 16,317 voting booths.</p>
        <p>''No accident is now possible,'' said Mr. Gbagbo, who stopped short of declaring victory but sounded confident enough that hundreds of supporters began cheering and dancing in celebration.</p>
        <p>Nearby, at General Guei's headquarters, the mood was subdued and there were only a few supporters when members of the military government held a news conference in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>The military government's spokesman, Capt. Henri Sama, said: ''We will win and we will win decisively. To our supporters, they can go on the streets to celebrate as well. We are confident.''</p>
        <p>Captain Sama criticized Mr. Gbagbo for announcing his own preliminary results, saying, ''The only results that count are those of the National Electoral Commission.''</p>
        <p>By then, however, the Commission had ceased making announcements.</p>
        <p>At about 5 p.m., the president of the Commission, Honore Guie, said on television that a ''pause'' was necessary because results had stopped arriving from outside the cities. ''There was a rumor that I had been arrested,'' he said, ''but I am here and the results will resume at 7 p.m.''</p>
        <p>But by late this evening, no further results had been announced.</p>
        <p>The delays marred what appeared to have been well-organized and fair voting on Sunday, based on the scene at voting booths and the assessments of diplomats. But according to official figures, turnout reached only about a third of the registered 5.5 million voters.</p>
        <p>Early this month, a court controlled by General Guei ruled that the candidates of the country's two main parties, the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast and the Rally of the Republicans, were not qualified to run for president. That left Mr. Gbagbo as the general's only credible opponent.</p>
        <p>Protesting the court's verdict, the United States and the European Union announced they would not help finance the vote or send observers.</p>
        <p>The two major parties -- which together garnered 75 percent of the votes in the legislative election in 1995 -- called for a boycott. And the nation's largest Islamic organization told Muslims not to vote because the court had disqualified all candidates from the Muslim north, leaving five Christian southerners to contest for the presidency of a country that is 40 percent Muslim.</p>
        <p>On a continent undermined by political instability and ethnic divisions, Ivory Coast had long been a shining exception. For more than three decades after independence from France in 1960, the country was governed by the Democratic Party under Felix Houphouet-Boigny. He had little patience for political opposition but used close ties with France to turn Ivory Coast into the richest French-speaking African country.</p>
        <p>But his clumsy successor, Henri Konan Bedie, fomented an ethnocentric campaign aimed at separating true Ivoirians from so-called outsiders. General Guei overthrew Mr. Bedie last December in the country's first coup.</p>
