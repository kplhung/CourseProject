        <p>''Always On Call: When Illness Turns Families into Caregivers,'' edited by Carol Levine (United Hospital Fund of New York, $20).</p>
        <p>If any toiler in the health care system deserves far more credit than he or she receives, it is the person who cares for an ailing loved one at home.</p>
        <p>Today, about 25 million Americans provide essential care to seriously ill or disabled family members. Where in years past families could do little more than soothe and maintain bedside vigils, today they monitor intravenous chemotherapy, operate mechanical ventilators, administer medications, change dressings, assist with home catheterization, track insurance payments and coordinate home care services. If they were paid, estimates Carol Levine, the editor of this series of essays on an endeavor that requires those with little training to take over for nurses and physical therapists, it would cost about $200 billion a year.</p>
        <p>The narratives of the caregivers and the health care professionals who have contributed to this book provide a look at a private world in which not only the patient but the caretaker is affected. It is not easy. Barry J. Jacobs, a psychologist, writes of the caregivers: ''One can feel proud and angry simultaneously. One can feel angry about being burdened, then feel guilty for having felt anger, and then become angry again for having been made to feel guilty.''</p>
        <p>Another contributor, Raymond J. Rigoglioso, an editor for the communications division of the United Hospital Fund, wrote: ''For most caregivers, caregiving becomes a chronic state of overwhelming tasks punctuated by emergencies. In addition to the physical care required, it creates financial tumult. Caregivers must learn and navigate one or more of the major insurance bureaucracies, becoming financial managers and advocates for their loved ones.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Levine and the other contributors to this thought-provoking book demand a revision in health care policy that provides long-term care to middle- and working-class patients, and they ask that the health care community offer training, advocacy and emotional support to family caregivers.  Federal tax credits and would better access to information would also help, she says.</p>
        <p>''This is not a problem that money alone can solve, although money is essential,'' she says. ''It's up to each of us -- professional or caregiver, present or future -- to speak out for our loved ones, our patients and ourselves.''</p>
