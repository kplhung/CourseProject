        <p>What's in a Name? A Series Ticket</p>
        <p>The woman in Row 1, Seat 9, at Yankee Stadium on Sunday night was named JANE HELLER. So was the woman in Row 1, Seat 8.</p>
        <p>The Jane Heller in Seat 9 (and above, left) was the Jane Heller who wrote ''Name Dropping,'' a novel about two women with the same name that was published this year by St. Martin's Press. To minimize the confusion here, let the record show that the two women in the ''Name Dropping'' book are both named Nancy Stern. Mercifully, for the sake of this item, not Jane Heller.</p>
        <p>The Jane Heller in Seat 8 was a banker whose clients include the principal owner of the Yankees, GEORGE M. STEINBRENNER 3rd, and MARTHA STEWART. She is the one who invited Jane Heller (the author) to sit in the same section of Yankee Stadium as MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI and his son, ANDREW; BUD SELIG, the commissioner of baseball; DENZEL WASHINGTON; SARAH JESSICA PARKER and her husband, MATTHEW BRODERICK; and THE REV. JESSE JACKSON.</p>
        <p>The two Jane Hellers had had an e-mail exchange several months ago in which Ms. Heller (the banker) said that she had all the other Ms. Heller's books -- and also had the best seats at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>That was several months ago.</p>
        <p>''When it got to be the post-season,'' Ms. Heller (the author) said, ''I thought, this would be a good time to hit her up for a couple of tickets. She said, 'Saturday is taken, but how about Sunday?' ''</p>
        <p>So they chatted with the likes of DEREK JETER and PAUL O'NEILL in the on-deck circle and traded stories about themselves, including the one about how Ms. Heller (the banker) came to be where she was.</p>
        <p>''When my son was 2, he said to me, 'Mommy, you should get the Yankees,' '' she said. ''I started calling on the Yankees. One day, George had a problem at Chemical Bank. He said, 'Get that girl who keeps coming up here.' It's been almost 26 years. I've been his private banker all that time and still am the private banker to the Yankees.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Heller (the author) said that Ms. Heller (the banker) asked when her next book would be out. ''April,'' the author said. ''I'm thinking about opening day.''</p>
        <p>At City Hall, where mudslinging and name-calling are not unheard of, the ROGER CLEMENS bat-flinging incident revealed loyalties that followed the political divide: Mayor Giuliani, a Republican and Yankee fan, and the City Council speaker, PETER F. VALLONE, a Democrat and Met fan, were on opposite sides.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani defended Clemens on the ABC program ''Good Morning America.'' Grabbing MIKE PIAZZA'S broken bat and throwing it toward him was merely an ''instinctual reaction,'' the mayor said. In the Giuliani equivalent of delayed play-by-play, he recreated the scene: ''The bat came at him; he threw it away. I think after he threw it away he realized, 'Oh, my goodness.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone countered later in the day that he was ''appalled'' by Clemens's action, reaction or whatever it was.  He declared that the World Series was no place for ''such childish and violent behavior.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone also said that he had written to Commissioner Selig ''urging him to take appropriate action to ensure that players restrain this kind of recklessness.''</p>
        <p>High Compliment</p>
        <p>The singer MARC ANTHONY is used to fans' tossing teddy bears and lingerie when he is on the stage. But Mr. Anthony blushed Friday night after he met CAROL BALDWIN before a performance at the Vanderbilt, an Art Deco hall in Plainview, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''Your breathing is so sexy,'' Mrs. Baldwin said. That, Mr. Anthony said, was the first time anyone had told him that. Mrs. Baldwin is not easily star-struck. She is the mother of the actors ALEC, DANIEL, WILLIAM and STEPHEN BALDWIN.</p>
        <p>Stephen Baldwin had been scheduled to welcome the crowd, but was late. So LYNNETTE COLE, Miss U.S.A., and JILLIAN PARRY, Miss Teen U.S.A., went onstage instead.  This gave the introduction a different flavor, particularly when Ms. Cole said: ''I feel sorry for all the boyfriends out there.''</p>
