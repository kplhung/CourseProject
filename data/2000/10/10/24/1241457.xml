        <p>Hopping among ethnic groups, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman set out to whip up supporters today in the crucial state of Florida, urging them to get out the vote and, paraphrasing a Frank Sinatra song, telling them, ''If we win it here, we'll win it everywhere.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman spoke to Jewish, black, Cuban and Haitian groups, capping the day with a sunset rally of about 500 people at Miami-Dade Community College.</p>
        <p>''Six months ago, nobody thought we'd be close in Florida,'' he said. ''It is a dead heat here in Florida, and the momentum is in our direction.''</p>
        <p>Florida is the biggest prize up for grabs in the presidential contest between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. (Of the three more populous states, California and New York appear to be in Mr. Gore's column, and Texas in Mr. Bush's.) As a result, Mr. Gore and his running mate, Mr. Lieberman, have treated Florida like a second home.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Bush holds a slim lead in national surveys -- two percentage points in a New York Times/CBS News Poll poll published today -- Democratic and Republican strategists say he needs Florida's 25 electoral votes to win the presidency.</p>
        <p>Speaking to 1,000 people today at the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center, in a Miami suburb, Mr. Lieberman took issue with Mr. Bush's call to withdraw American forces from peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia and Kosovo. Echoing statements made by Mr. Gore on Sunday, Mr. Lieberman said such a withdrawal would ''wound'' the NATO alliance. He suggested that Mr. Bush's understanding of world affairs was lacking, and drew a contrast to Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''I think you've got to consider the extraordinary experience Al Gore has had in foreign policy and military matters, and it's one of the reasons to vote for him,'' he said. ''If Governor Bush thinks he's going to pull American soldiers out of peace-keeping in Europe, he hasn't learned the lessons of the two world wars we fought and the cold war.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Bush campaign, Dan Bartlett, said that in their Oct. 11 debate, Mr. Gore had agreed with Mr. Bush about withdrawing forces from the Balkans, and called the criticism ''puzzling.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore said at the debate that troops should be sent home ''as soon as the mission is complete.'' Mr. Bush is seeking a complete American withdrawal from such missions, which Mr. Gore has never supported.</p>
        <p>In that debate, Mr. Bush also seemed to blunder, saying that the European allies should ''put troops on the ground'' in the Balkans, when they already supply more than 80 percent of the peacekeepers there.</p>
        <p>On the Mideast, Mr. Lieberman, the first Jew on a major party's national ticket, told the synagogue audience that while he and Mr. Gore would pursue a peace treaty, ''we will also not forget the ties of values and strategic interests and alliance that tie the United States of America and Israel together now for 50-plus years.'' That has essentially been the American position for decades. But President Clinton has tried not to appear to take sides as he seeks to broker an Israeli-Palestinian settlement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's remarks could play into the fears of Arab-Americans. The Arab-American Political Action Committee recently endorsed Mr. Bush, with some members concerned that Mr. Lieberman would not be impartial on the Mideast.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, Mr. Lieberman visited the family of the late Jorge Mas Canosa, and the grave of Mr. Mas, the most prominent leader of anti-Castro Cuban-Americans.</p>
        <p>The senator also addressed a group of 70 Cuban-American leaders, pledging that Mr. Gore would not lift the trade embargo against Cuba as long as Fidel Castro was in power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman started his day with a visit to a diner in the heavily black Liberty City section of Miami, accompanied by several black ministers. Later, he attended a small rally of Haitian-Americans.</p>
