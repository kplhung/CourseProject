        <p>Shunsuke Sato, violinist  92nd Street Y</p>
        <p>The debut recitals of teenage winners of the Young Concert Artists auditions over the years have aroused conflicted responses in sensitive listeners: an almost visceral thrill in seeing young musicians executing great technical feats but the nagging sense that these players have slipped too quickly into the pressures of adulthood.</p>
        <p>That said, Shunsuke Sato, the 16-year-old violinist who played his New York debut recital last Tuesday evening, appeared in every way to be ready to play in public, and his concert was a knockout. Mr. Sato was born in Tokyo, moved to the United States when he was 3, and won the Young Concert Auditions when he was 12. He has developed an astonishing level of poise and musicality, and he looked entirely comfortable onstage, playing his entire program from memory but with a suppleness that made it clear that he was not playing by rote.</p>
        <p>Technical challenges seemed not to faze him, but it was the fluidity of his playing that impressed, rather than its muscularity. There were plenty of dazzling moments, though. The opening movement of Strauss's youthful Sonata (Op. 18) was enlivened by Mr. Sato's drive, focus and dynamic subtlety. He drew sparks in both the Bizet-Waxman ''Carmen'' Fantasy and in the prismatic Bachian counterpoint of Ysaye's unaccompanied Sonata No. 2. More striking, though, was the poetry he brought to the Andante cantabile of the Strauss and a transcription of Debussy's ''Plus Que Lent,'' and the atmospheric charm in his account of Castelnuovo-Tedesco's ''Alt Wien.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sato had the support of an experienced and eloquent accompanist, Rohan De Silva.</p>
