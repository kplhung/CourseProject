        <p>In one of the mini-essays he regularly composes, Moby, dance music's philosopher king, wrote that ''context is determined by collective subjective assessment, and not so much by geography or history.''

        <p>In one of the mini-essays he regularly composes, Moby, dance music's philosopher king, wrote that ''context is determined by collective subjective assessment, and not so much by geography or history.'' He was  discussing his ingenious reworkings of field recordings of African-American singers, collected by Alan Lomax in midcentury, into millennial disco affirmations on his hit album ''Play'' (V2). Moby might have lugged out the same academic jargon to define his whole project, which reached its latest apotheosis on Wednesday night at Hammerstein Ballroom.</p>
        <p>More than nearly any other contemporary pop star, Moby stays conscious of music's transfigurative power. A rocker boy who discovered the wider musical vistas of the dance floor, he makes the most personal beat-driven music out there. His shows are communal experiences that remain focused on Moby's role as emotional conduit and coach. That's how he earned the title of dance music's first rock star.</p>
        <p>The problem that Moby must keep solving is how to move beyond the initial surprise that his stylistic realignments cause. Mixing rock attitude with dance moves goes only so far. At Hammerstein he worked hard to go beyond his usual strategies.</p>
        <p>The next-step tactics began with his band. Moby has been playing with a live bassist and drummer for a while; now he has added a turntablist, DJ Spinbad, and a backing vocalist, Dianne Charlemagne.</p>
        <p>Ms. Charlemagne was the crucial new link. This English diva gained notice collaborating with the drum-and-bass master Goldie, but with Moby she is still feeling out her role.</p>
        <p>When she stepped forward vocally, most notably in a gentle take on ''Everytime You Touch Me'' that put her alone with Moby on acoustic guitar, she showed her excellent range. Too often, though, her job was to augment vocal samples, which made her a strange proxy for those lost voices ''Play'' resurrects.</p>
        <p>Moby announced that he and Ms. Charlemagne were recording new material, and given her own central stance in his music, she will surely impress. Not that it's easy for Moby ever to share the spotlight. His frenetic stage presence is another way he messes around with context: his persona is mild-mannered, but under the spell of his own beats he becomes Dionysian. He is the nerd who never gets onto the dance floor, suddenly ruling it.</p>
        <p>He played up his meekness on Wednesday by sharing anecdotes about high school, where he fantasized about playing guitar solos like ''the cool kids.'' He asked the crowd to forgive his self-indulgence as he spat out such a solo before his hip-hop-influenced ''Bodyrock.'' He also led the bassist, Greta Brinkman, and the drummer, Scott Frassetto, through a version of ''The End'' by the Doors, for which he also apologized.</p>
        <p>There was no need for contrition. Fans adore Moby because he creates ecstatic dance tracks and also because he keeps disturbing the formula. Sometimes his tinkerings are purposeful; at the end of the show he and the band performed ''Run on for a Long Time,'' a gospel song he samples on ''Play,'' in its entirety, revealing its original meaning to the curious. Sometimes they are just spins of the wheel. It's the willingness to bet high that keeps Moby in the game.</p>
