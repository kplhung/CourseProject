        <p>To look at Steven Meisel's fall advertisements for Versace and Max Mara, in which the women are displayed as prettily as Canton porcelain, is to imagine a world in which the men have permanently adjourned to the library for brandy and cigars. In that way the ads are curiously old-fashioned. They may contrive to leave a hip impression of female superiority, but as with an old movie, when the couples divide after dinner, don't you share the heroine's gloom to be stuck out with the ladies?</p>
        <p>Fashion is asking the same question. After a season or two of frankly feminine clothes -- those ladylike blouses and pert executive suits that gave retailers and customers alike something easy to focus on -- designers are bringing men back into the discussion.</p>

        <p>To look at Steven Meisel's fall advertisements for Versace and Max Mara, in which the women are displayed as prettily as Canton porcelain, is to imagine a world in which the men have permanently adjourned to the library for brandy and cigars. In that way the ads are curiously old-fashioned. They may contrive to leave a hip impression of female superiority, but as with an old movie, when the couples divide after dinner, don't you share the heroine's gloom to be stuck out with the ladies?</p>
        <p>Fashion is asking the same question. After a season or two of frankly feminine clothes -- those ladylike blouses and pert executive suits that gave retailers and customers alike something easy to focus on -- designers are bringing men back into the discussion.</p>
        <p>And none too soon. Without the louche toughness of a broad-shouldered men's jacket, without the yin and yang of a bra under a sharp pantsuit or a cummerbund worn as a ruched corset, fashion was in danger of drifting into one of the longest-running ladies' lunches in history.</p>
        <p>With the exception of wider shoulders and some of the fuller, pleated pants styles, the clothes women will wear next spring don't require a big imaginative leap. The look is still polished, put together, but with a slightly harder, masculine edge.</p>
        <p>If the New York collections, which ended on Sept. 22, seemed unremittingly girlish in their revivalist affection for flaring disco skirts and loud, 1980's colors, it was a different story altogether by mid-October, when the French shows closed. Whether the look was expressed in the punk outrage of Rei Kawakubo or the garage couture of John Galliano at Dior, or more subtly in the cool appropriation of military styles at Louis Vuitton and Max Mara, it was anything but girlish. Indeed, it could be summed up in the word that happens to be Giorgio Armani's modern ideal: garcon.</p>
        <p>No designer was more favorably placed to exploit this boy-meets-girl story than Tom Ford at Yves Saint Laurent. Chic androgyny is the essence of the Saint Laurent style. Yet, perhaps because of the heavy expectations riding on his first collection as the creative director for Saint Laurent ready-to-wear, Mr. Ford just missed claiming the moment. He had waistcoats and, of course, those fuller jackets and lower slung trousers. But his collection didn't have that faint odor of the streets, that slightly dirty but uncomplicated sense of sex and freedom that a photographer like Helmut Newton instinctively recognized when, in the 1970's, he put Saint Laurent's pantsuits on boyish-looking models and photographed them on streets cruised by prostitutes.</p>
        <p>Other designers who caught the wave for a tougher attitude included Nicolas Ghesquiere of Balenciaga; Ralph Lauren; Marc Jacobs at Vuitton; Daryl Kerrigan; Miuccia Prada, whose drab palette and chaste dirndl skirts are practically lady-killers; and Helmut Lang, who showed everyone how to wear a bra under a summer suit without looking like a flaming fool.</p>
        <p>All these designers had something fresh to say, but if one can really be said to claim the season it was Alexander McQueen. With his own collection in London, and the one he showed a couple of weeks later in Paris for Givenchy, Mr. McQueen proved with his erotic blend of masculine tailoring and feminine underpinnings that he supremely gets this mojo moment.</p>
        <p>In a way, he did what Tom Ford should have done at Saint Laurent. He gave that hint not merely of a woman in a man's clothes, but more exquisitely of a man undressing a woman. The blouse removed, the suspenders already lapping dangerously at her sides.</p>
        <p>Here are some other looks for spring.</p>
        <p>ENGLISH-NOVEL CLOTHES -- That's how Judy Collinson, the general merchandising manager of Barneys New York, succinctly described Ms. Prada's fuller skirts and homey sweaters. And there is something agreeably quiet, even country mouse, about her look this season. But other retailers weren't so enthralled by the many fuller skirts on the runways in Milan and Paris. It's a style that designers like Karl Lagerfeld and Dries van Noten have been touting for the last couple of seasons, but it hasn't turned up with any conviction on the streets. Maybe for spring. Joan Kaner, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, said she preferred Prada's very slim skirts in jersey. ''I think it's going to be the sleeper of the season,'' she said.</p>
        <p>AMERICAN CLASSICS -- Who would have thought that Miguel Adrover, after having the shoestring audacity to remake Quentin Crisp's mattress into a jacket, would embrace the preppy style of Ralph Lauren? He did, and as the collections played out in New York and abroad, his clever reprise of polo shirts, blazers and other earnest country-club attire were right on the mark. ''He did it so subtly, he almost confused people,'' Ms. Collinson said. Veronique Branquinho and Bernhard Willhelm were on a similar wave-length, with clothes that hovered between being astonishingly graceful and inexplicably dowdy. But as Ms. Collinson points out, it's a look, with almost antifashion overtones, that keeps turning up in avant-garde fashion magazines like Self Service.</p>
        <p>DRESS ATTACK -- Almost everyone has some variation on the dress, from the gladiator drapes at Callaghan, Fendi and Daryl K to crisscrossed (make that Alaia-crossed) sundresses at Helmut Lang and the classic slips and shirtwaist styles at Calvin Klein and Oscar de la Renta. Hemlines flutter around the knees, but mini and asymmetrical hems look newer.</p>
        <p>IT'S ALL IN THE WAIST -- ''The belt survived,'' said Jacqui Lividini, senior vice president of fashion merchandising at Saks Fifth Avenue, singling out the key accessory for spring. What's different this season is the shape: it's wider, almost like a cummerbund, and turns up punched with grommets or adorned with bits of fringe fabric (at Balenciaga). Think of the belt, worn either on the waist or low on the hips, as a tough counterpoint to flounced skirts or those one-shoulder draped tops and dresses, which are everywhere this season.</p>
        <p>SOMETHING NOVEL -- ''Nobody can say this was a definitive season,'' Ms. Collinson said, ''and you had the feeling that designers were saying that with their collections.'' And when fashion is in transition, there is no better time to play -- and forget what you think you know about clothes. It came as something of a surprise to discover that those hot-pink bloomers at Oscar de la Renta's show, which had caused people to snigger, were actually from a collection that Mr. de la Renta did in 1968. Not a new thing at all! In fact, they and other styles from the season may just be the looks that win. After all, as Andre Leon Talley, the editor at large of Vogue, pointed out, there's a world of fashion that the public and paparazzi don't see, and for those intrepid style seekers, ''the red carpet is in their living room.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 25, 2000, Wednesday  Picture captions on the Fashion page yesterday with a report about women's clothes with a masculine touch misspelled a designer's given name and the name of an apparel company. The designer is Nicolas Ghesquiere, not Nicholas; the company is Max Mara, not Marra.</p>
