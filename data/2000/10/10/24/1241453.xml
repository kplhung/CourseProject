        <p>The board of Lucent Technologies has ousted its chairman and chief executive, Richard A. McGinn, in a move to curb the earnings erosion that threatens to undermine Lucent, the world's largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment.</p>
        <p>Lucent's board replaced Mr. McGinn, who only two weeks ago insisted that he had no plans to leave the company, with Henry Schacht, who served as Lucent's first chairman and chief executive for 18 months after it was spun off from AT&amp;T in 1996. The board took action Sunday night, and the company announced the change yesterday morning.</p>
        <p>To take the post, Mr. Schacht, 66, resigned as chairman of Avaya Inc., a manufacturer of office communications equipment that itself was spun off from Lucent earlier this year. He plans to remain on the Avaya board as he serves as Lucent's interim head while it conducts a search for another chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGinn was Lucent's president under Mr. Schacht. But during Mr. McGinn's three-year tenure as chief executive, Lucent went from a fast-growing Wall Street darling to a source of concern among many investors after it did not meet optimistic growth promises.</p>
        <p>Each financial quarter this year, the company has had to warn that earnings would be lower than analysts had expected -- a string that was extended yesterday, when Lucent warned that not only earnings, but revenue, would decline in the quarter that ends in December.</p>
        <p>After the stock market's close yesterday, Lucent said revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2001, which ends in December, would decline by about 7 percent from $7.9 billion in the period a year earlier, while earnings from operations would break even at about $1.08 billion.</p>
        <p>The company said the revised expectations reflected difficulties it had had in rolling out a new generation of optical networking equipment that allowed large amounts of digital information to be transmitted using a single wavelength of light.</p>
        <p>Lucent's stock has declined by 72 percent from a high of $79.58 only 10 months ago. The company's shares fell 56 cents, to $22.06 yesterday. With 5.3 million shareholders, Lucent is among the most widely held stocks in the United States.</p>
        <p>''It's been a frustrating, rocky road,'' said John Waterman, managing director of Rittenhouse Financial Services, a Philadelphia investment manager with more than seven million Lucent shares in its portfolio. ''The need for fresh blood is essential.''</p>
        <p>Lucent also reported financial results yesterday for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 30. In keeping with a previous warning, Lucent reported a loss of $225 million, or 13 cents a share, including a loss for discontinued operations.</p>
        <p>Excluding costs for acquisitions, earnings from continuing operations were $600 million, or 18 cents a share, down from $768 million, or 24 cents a share, while revenue increased 14.6 percent, to $9.4 billion in the quarter.</p>
        <p>Earnings declined after the company set aside funds to cover potentially questionable debts from clients that borrowed money to acquire Lucent's products. In addition, sales of voice switches and fiber optic equipment were not as robust the company had hoped.</p>
        <p>In a conference call with investors, Lucent also attributed the earnings decline to an unexpected shortfall of approximately $2 billion in revenue from contracts with two clients, one in the United States and the other abroad. The company did not provide the names of the clients.</p>
        <p>''We are clearly disappointed in our results,'' said Mr. Schacht, Lucent's new chief executive.</p>
        <p>If anything, Lucent's woes highlight an old-economy technology company focused previously on voice telephone calls and PC-centric practices that has struggled to make the transition to the new economy's emphasis on data exchanges and Internet-centric activities.</p>
        <p>Part of Lucent's problems may derive from a failure to deliver products developed by the company's Bell Labs research division to customers in a nimble and efficient way, analysts said.</p>
        <p>''Smaller competitors are nibbling away at Lucent's chair,'' said Greg Geiling, an analyst at J. P. Morgan. ''Psychologically, it's had a devastating effect, so some catalyst is needed to stem defections.''</p>
        <p>At Lucent, which is based in Murray Hill, N.J. and has 126,000 employees, staff turnover has reached 20 percent this year. It has becoming increasingly clear that Lucent has languished while companies in the fiber optics arena, like Nortel Networks of Canada and the Ciena Corporation, and makers of the router boxes that handle Internet traffic, most notably Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks, have raced ahead.</p>
        <p>It was uncertain late yesterday from which industry or company Lucent might seek to recruit a new chief executive. But analysts said candidates would most likely come from competitors that are familiar with Lucent's business.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the company's management did not rule out layoffs for some of the company's work force as part of a company overhaul,  said Deborah Hopkins, the company's chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>''I am personally grateful for Rich McGinn's contributions to the business,'' Mr. Schacht wrote in a letter to Lucent employees. ''However, the board felt a different set of skills was required at this point in the company's life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McGinn was not available for comment.</p>
