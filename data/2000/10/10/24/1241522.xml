        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright plunged into Communist North Korea today, meeting with the nation's mysterious leader, Kim Jong Il, and attending a gargantuan spectacle of about 100,000 performers that celebrated the cult of her host.</p>
        <p>In a day of surprising high-stakes diplomacy, Mr. Kim and Dr. Albright, the first senior American official to meet a North Korean leader, spent more than six hours together, discussing strategic differences that divide the two countries but also impressing each other with warm gestures and words.</p>
        <p>The North Korean leader went out of his way to play the gracious host, moving up by one day his negotiating session with her and then inviting her to the spectacle, where Dr. Albright, who ordinarily champions Western democracy, enthusiastically applauded the 90-minute authoritarian display of choreography and chorus.</p>
        <p>The biggest surprise was the invitation to Dr. Albright to attend the spectacle at the sports stadium this evening, where she arrived with Mr. Kim, wearing his standard khaki jacket and pants. She sat next to him on a dais above the performance, and from time to time Mr. Kim would ask the interpreter to point out special features of the event.</p>
        <p>As the two arrived, the huge crowd at the stadium rose in unison, and to thunderous music, people fervently stretched their arms toward Mr. Kim as if to a deity.</p>
        <p>The dome then filled with fireworks, and an entire side of the arena in front of Mr. Kim and Dr. Albright blinked with changing images, mostly graphics of Communist symbols and triumphs, with tractors, great potato harvests and electrical transformers.</p>
        <p>The images were created by about 30,000 people seated side by side holding color-coded cards in front of them and flicking them in highly synchronized movements to achieve the patterns, Korean officials said. The extravaganza was performed two weeks ago in a tribute to the Workers Party of Korea and repeated for the visiting American.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright responded to Mr. Kim's hospitality with a friendly toast tonight, saying as he sat next to her at a dinner table in a government guest house: ''America's symbol is the eagle, a bird that soars, and Korea's pride is mountains that scrape the sky. There is no obstacle we cannot overcome if we make the strategic decision to do so together.''</p>
        <p>In three hours of talks, Dr. Albright got down to serious business with Mr. Kim, discussing ''issues of concern to the United States.'' Her spokesman Richard A. Boucher said the talks had been ''substantive and useful.''</p>
        <p>The length of the first face-to-face session and the fact that a second is scheduled for Tuesday appeared to indicate that both sides were trying to resolve questions about North Korea's missile and nuclear programs so that President Clinton could make a visit here before he leaves office.</p>
        <p>The North Koreans agreed to a temporary moratorium on their missile-testing program last year and in return the Clinton administration lifted some economic sanctions. But the White House wants to see how much further the North Koreans will go in shutting down their missile research, development and exports before making a final decision on a presidential trip.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the North Koreans test-fired a Taepodong missile, a move that hastened the Clinton administration's decision to move ahead with a national missile defense system and that unsettled Japan and South Korea. Since then, rapid efforts by South Korea to move toward reconciliation with North Korea have defused some of the tensions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boucher declined to be specific on the likelihood of a presidential visit but said that ''being able to deal with these issues successfully is the key to a visit of the president.'' He said that Dr. Albright told him Mr. Kim was ''fully engaged'' during their discussions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright gave Mr. Kim a letter from Mr. Clinton that outlined ''the expectation of further developing relations'' between Washington and North Korea, Mr. Boucher said.</p>
        <p>In her toast at the dinner, where bottles of fine French wine were liberally set, Dr. Albright gave a sense of what might be in the presidential letter: ''I believe that our meetings during these two days will help us to move further down the road of cooperation,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Chairman, the process in which we are now engaged is a process that your father, President Kim Il Sung, helped to begin. It can lead to reconciliation and reunification of the peninsula and to more normal and prosperous relations between your government and others in the region and the world.''</p>
        <p>Distance between the two countries was ''no barrier to closer ties,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Campaigning today in New York, Mr. Clinton said, ''We have some hope of resolving our outstanding differences with North Korea and looking forward to the day when they will truly close the last chapter in the aftermath of the Korean War.''</p>
        <p>Many aspects of events in North Korea today, like the sudden planning of Dr. Albright's trip itself, were filled with unexpected twists and turns, apparently a technique that Mr. Kim likes to use with his guests.</p>
        <p>The incongruity of Dr. Albright, who has made democracy a leitmotif, applauding a mass propaganda show dedicated to the 55th anniversary of the Korean Workers Party, was most likely lost on her hosts.</p>
        <p>But there were several images in the show that must have unnerved Dr. Albright, including one depicting the launch of a long-range ballistic missile, superimposed on the wall of the stadium in front of her. The missile is the very weapon that Dr. Albright has come to persuade the North Koreans to abandon.</p>
        <p>Most of the audience were men in dark suits with red lapel pins showing Mr. Kim and most were members of the Communist Party. Many in the audience looked with a combination of suspicion and awe as a group of Western reporters sat in comfortable green velour chairs in spots usually reserved for special guests.</p>
        <p>The precision of dancing and gymnastics, and the din of brass and drum music, combined with choral works, made similar efforts at Socialist entertainment by the former Soviet Union and China pale by comparison. The effort took 10 months of rehearsing, said Foreign Ministry officials accompanying foreign reporters, and obviously involved many grueling hours of training for young children.</p>
        <p>A closing scene titled ''We will support our powerful nation with rifles'' was staged by thousands of men in army uniform who marched in lock step and shouted, ''We will safeguard our dear leader!'' A less threatening dance called ''The leader will always be with us'' involved probably more than a thousand children dressed in white and performing gymnastics in exact formations. Pictures of Dr. Albright chatting amiably with Mr. Kim at the spectacle were used on government television news tonight, in a lead item that stressed the prestige of having such an honored guest attend the show.</p>
        <p>The North Koreans set the tone of the visit soon after Dr. Albright's arrival by having her meet Marshal Jo Myong Rok, the military official who came to Washington earlier this month, at the mausoleum of Kim Il Sung, the father of the current leader. The secretary was escorted to the bier of Mr. Kim where she stopped briefly to pay her respects, Mr. Boucher said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright then visited the Rangnang kindergarten, where American food delivered by the United Nations World Food Program provides three meals a day to the children, including cabbage soup and buns for lunch today. Even at the kindergarten, Dr. Albright was treated to a performance by 6-year-olds, who performed  synchronized steps and sang to the glory of her host, Mr. Kim.</p>
        <p>With the country suffering from famine, a survey by the United Nations two years ago indicated that two-thirds of the population suffered from chronic malnutrition and were stunted in their growth.</p>
        <p>The children at the kindergarten appeared well fed, but this was because they were receiving almost their entire nourishment from the United Nations, said the program's director, Douglas Broderick. Further, as urban children, they were better off than those in the countryside, he said.</p>
        <p>The children at the center came from the tall apartment blocks nearby where electricity functions about one or two hours a day. Most households have little to cook even when the electricity is on, and meat is a luxury distributed on holidays only, Mr. Broderick added.</p>
        <p>Like this evening at the stadium, the main attraction at the kindergarten was the entertainment by rigorously trained children. ''Pay attention to me,'' and ''Head up,'' said a teacher as she rehearsed a group of girls, adorned with pale pink lipstick, ribbons in their hair and yellow-and-pink dresses.</p>
        <p>Beyond the staged events for Dr. Albright, the city of Pyongyang went about its normal activities. Reporters were given a little more leeway than most foreigners to go outside the Koryo Hotel and walk a few blocks, apparently a gesture of openness. Interpreters and security officials from the Foreign Ministry tried to accompany reporters at all times, although a noodle bar down a side street near the hotel frequented by foreign aid workers and better-off Koreans seemed open to reporters.</p>
        <p>A few buses were on the streets, but the main mode of transportation was walking. About 2,000 privately owned cars have shown up on the streets in the last year, officials said. Most of them are probably bought with remittances from relatives in Japan, they said.</p>
        <p>On a street corner in the center of the city, two women -- apparently municipal workers -- were bent over a pile of sand and water mixing it for poor quality concrete to fix a manhole. A string of restaurants on a main street were closed, the windows dirty and only a few tables inside. A kiosk selling sweet potatoes, doing a fairly brisk business -- or at least creating a lot of interest -- was the only sign of retail life.</p>
        <p>Usually, because of the dire energy shortage, the city is blanketed in darkness, foreigners who live here said. But streetlights were switched on tonight as were lights in the stairwells of the apartment blocks across the street from the Koryo Hotel, apparently in honor of the American delegation and in a signal that North Korea would survive no matter what.</p>
