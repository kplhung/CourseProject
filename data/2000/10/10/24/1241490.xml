        <p>''Are you a man who has trouble controlling your temper? Do your friends and family refer to you as quick-tempered or a hot-head?''</p>
        <p>Scores of men who have heard this message advertised on the radio in New Orleans the last two years have followed its urgings to a local anger-management clinic. From that group, researchers from the University of New Orleans have selected some to take part in an experiment to see if a widely used anticonvulsant called Dilantin might also curb aggressive outbursts.</p>
        <p>Thousands of drug trials like this one are paid for each year by pharmaceutical companies or government agencies.</p>
        <p>But not the New Orleans study. It and hundreds of other trials of Dilantin the last four decades have been conducted because of the insistence -- and the riches -- of one man: Jack Dreyfus, the former president of the Dreyfus Fund, one of the first successful mutual funds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dreyfus, a legendary winner at card games, the race track and on Wall Street, where the Dreyfus lion came to symbolize an aggressive style of investing, credits Dilantin for his own Lazarus-like recovery from depression.</p>
        <p>And so began a quixotic crusade. Leaving Wall Street behind, he dedicated his time, connections and more than $60 million of his money to championing -- despite doubts among many medical experts -- a single drug, in which he has no financial interest.</p>
        <p>The mission of the Dreyfus Health Foundation appears weirdly at odds with medical research, experts say. Rather than searching for the best drug to cure specific health problems, it casts about for health problems that one drug -- Dilantin -- might cure.</p>
        <p>Airline passengers in China have taken Dilantin, known generically as phenytoin, to see if could ward off the effects of flying. It has been administered to children in Brazil who have attention deficit disorder and smeared on the skin ulcers of lepers in India. Prisoners in Texas and Russia have taken it. And, thanks to Mr. Dreyfus, a president of the United States apparently received samples of the drug while in office.</p>
        <p>In ''The Arrogance of Power: The Secret World of Richard Nixon'' (Viking, 2000), the author, Anthony Summers, writes that Mr. Dreyfus told him that he had given large quantities of Dilantin to President Nixon on two occasions to improve his ''moods.'' Two former Nixon aides have disputed that account, saying they saw no evidence that Mr. Nixon used the drug while in office. But in a recent interview in his New York office, Mr. Dreyfus not only elaborated on the encounters but claimed that the former president sought more Dilantin from him nine years after he left the White House.</p>
        <p>''When he was 70 he was here and he asked for more, and I gave it to him,'' Mr. Dreyfus said. ''I know it is a prescription drug, but a president is a president.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dreyfus, a one-time amateur tennis champion, is still agile at 87. And his passion to see Dilantin, which he has been taking for 35 years, used wherever possible is undiminished.</p>
        <p>He described the medication, which is still the most-prescribed treatment in this country for epilepsy, as a miracle drug that can improve moods, reduce fear and anger, improve sleep, lower high blood pressure and relieve shortness of breath, to name just a few uses.</p>
        <p>''It is the most remarkable drug that there is,'' Mr. Dreyfus said.</p>
        <p>The scientific world has largely written off Mr. Dreyfus as a well-intentioned oddball prone to confusing subjective impressions with scientific evidence.</p>
        <p>''He had a bug in his head,'' said Dr. Joseph Stephens, a psychiatrist who headed trials financed by Mr. Dreyfus in 1970 at Johns Hopkins University to see if Dilantin could reduce anxiety and impatience. ''And that was everyone should be on Dilantin.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Barry Smith, director of the Dreyfus foundation, agreed that its  primary goal was to explore the drug's usefulness. But he rejected any suggestion that the foundation, which has been active in 30 countries, was solely focused on promotion, adding that it had also financed projects that helped poorer nations redesign their public health programs.</p>
        <p>''If you can catalyze change in the way people look at problems, then Dilantin is going to find its rightful place, or no place,'' Dr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>The group has found a few new applications for Dilantin, including broadening its use as a topical healing agent. And certainly the foundation's programs have provided some benefits. For example, those who respond to the radio ads in New Orleans get extensive psychological evaluations even if they do not participate in the Dilantin trial.</p>
        <p>But despite Mr. Dreyfus's efforts, Dilantin's place has not significantly expanded beyond seizure disorders. The precise mechanism by which the drug controls seizures is unknown but researchers have theorized that it dampens an excessive buildup of electrical activity in certain brain cells.</p>
        <p>Anticonvulsants like Dilantin are now used in combination with other drugs to control psychiatric problems like mania and aggression. But those medications are latter-day cousins of Dilantin, and scientists said that their use emerged from research unrelated to Mr. Dreyfus's campaign. Dilantin is made by Parke-Davis, a unit of Warner-Lambert.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert M. Post, who pioneered the use of the anticonvulsant Tegretol in mania treatment, said his work grew out of research that showed Tegretol to be superior to Dilantin in dampening hyperexcitability in the primitive part of the brain, the apparent site of problems like mania. He added that he had also chosen the drug because research showed it had other benefits: ''People with epilepsy said that Tegretol even had a more positive effect on mood'' than did Dilantin, said Dr. Post, who is the chief of the biological psychiatry branch at the National Institutes of Mental Health.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dreyfus's tale of his encounter with Dilantin has the feel of science fiction. In 1963, while at the height of his powers as a Wall Street investor, Mr. Dreyfus awoke in a state of terror. He became locked in a deep depression that conventional treatments did not cure.</p>
        <p>Then, as Mr. Dreyfus recounted in ''A Remarkable Medicine Has Been Overlooked,'' a 1981 book whose publication he financed, he had a notion. He sensed ''electricity'' in his body that appeared to intensify with feelings of fear, anger or anxiety. He recalled an epileptic seizure he had observed some 20 years earlier, which, in hindsight, suggested electrical shocks. He soon learned that many epileptics took Dilantin, which was first used 60 years ago to treat that disorder.</p>
        <p>He asked his psychiatrist to prescribe it for him. Within a day, the major symptoms of his emotional distress began to disappear. A few days later, he wrote in his book, ''My need for psychotherapy was gone.''</p>
        <p>Several experts said that Mr. Dreyfus's description suggested that he may have experienced an idiosyncratic, or individual, response to a drug or a placebo effect, or a therapeutic reaction to a substance that is not known to have such an effect.</p>
        <p>''You can't discount the possibility that Mr. Dreyfus recovered from Dilantin,'' said Dr. Stephen M. Stahl, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California at San Diego and an expert on psychopharmacology. ''But it would be considered idiosyncratic.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Smith, the foundation's director, said that he also experimented with Dilantin and noticed his ability to concentrate improved within an hour after the first capsule. Sadly, he said, he soon developed an allergic reaction and had to stop taking the medication. Other known side effects include mental confusion, excessive growth of the gums and loss of sensation in hands and feet.</p>
        <p>Most recently, studies financed by the foundation have tried to see whether Dilantin can control ''impulsive aggression.'' The term, not a recognized psychiatric disorder, is used to characterize symptoms common to various mental problems: overreaction, often violent, to a perceived slight or threat.</p>
        <p>''Jack has been very concerned about the problem of violence,'' Dr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>Under foundation grants, Dilantin has been tested on prisoners in Texas and Russia. The Texas study, which was reported in 1997 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology, found that Dilantin reduced both the frequency and intensity of impulsive aggression among inmates. Dr. Natalia Bechtereva, director of the Institute of the Human Brain in St. Petersburg, said a small-scale study financed by Mr. Dreyfus suggested that the drug was helpful in reducing anxiety and negative thoughts.</p>
        <p>She said the drug appeared particularly helpful in the ''very difficult conditions'' in Russia where inmates were housed in cramped cells.</p>
        <p>''They sleep under Dilantin,'' said Dr. Bechtereva. ''Not because it is a sleeping drug. It isn't. But they are relaxed.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, the foundation presented the results of the Texas study to operators of both private and public prisons in this country to interest them in using Dilantin. Thus far, there have been no takers.</p>
        <p>Dr. Matthew Stanford, chairman of the psychology department at the University of New Orleans, said that the Dreyfus-financed trial of the drug that he is heading with men who responded to the radio ads is going well.</p>
        <p>''It is amazing the life changes we see in these guys,'' said Dr. Stanford, who also worked on the Texas prison studies. ''I have had wives in my office weeping, saying 'I don't know what you did to him, but he is different.' ''</p>
        <p>Dr. Stanford's results will not be published for at least a year. But several experts on impulsivity said the research sponsored by Mr. Dreyfus appeared to be replowing old ground that most scientists had long bypassed because newer and better drugs were available.</p>
        <p>Whatever the merits of Mr. Dreyfus's mission, some who have worked with him over the years are effusive. ''I have never met such a generous and noble man,'' Dr. Bechtereva said. For his part, Dr. Stanford cast Mr. Dreyfus as ''a genius or visionary.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Stephens, who headed the Johns Hopkins trials in the 1970's, was amazed to learn that Mr. Dreyfus's campaign had not ended. But he, too, fondly remembered the former investor. There were clubby cocktail parties in Mr. Dreyfus's art-filled Manhattan apartment. And there was the cheese.</p>
        <p>Each year he worked on Dreyfus-financed projects a large wheel  would arrive around Christmas.  ''When I was no longer in it,'' Dr. Stephens said, ''I never got the cheese anymore, and I missed it.''</p>
