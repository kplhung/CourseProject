        <p>Chairman of the advisory committee of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics.</p>
        <p>On April 10, 1986, . . . my wife collapsed . . . from the rupture of two brain aneurysms. That began a phantasmagoria of events that has since determined the structure of our lives. In a traumatic second, she went from being an articulate public speaker, college administrator, teacher and extraordinary wife and mother to a severely damaged woman. In the past 14 years, she has defied almost every statistic. Very few people survive the level of cerebral damage she sustained. If . . . they do survive, the extent of brain damage . . . results in severe cognitive disruption. . . .</p>

        <p>In retrospect, I realize that I had been thrust into the role of caregiver without any preparation. None of the health care professionals providing for my wife . . . ever told me how to manage the transition from acute emergency to chronic illness, from being a husband to also being a caregiver. . . . This transition is still happening 14 years later.</p>

        <p>Family members caring for a loved one at the end of life often experience a series of difficult and frightening events. The physical needs of dying patients can be tremendous, placing extraordinary burdens on caregivers. . . .</p>
        <p>It is clear that family caregivers of dying patients find themselves in the most vulnerable and fragile positions they have probably ever occupied, with a level of physical exertion and emotional endurance probably unrivaled by any other experience they are likely to encounter. At a time when family caregivers have the greatest needs, the deficiencies in the health care system become even more apparent. Health care institutions and professionals can and must improve their efforts to provide support and guidance to ease family caregivers' anxieties, reduce their physical burdens, and facilitate the decision-making process for end-of-life care.</p>
