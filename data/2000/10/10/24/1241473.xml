        <p>Editorial says even most ardent Yankee fans are unsettled by behavior of Roger Clemens in opening moments of World Series game 2, when he threw piece of broken bat across path of Mets' Mike Piazza; says Bud Selig, baseball commissioner, should notify Yankees that Clemens has no margin for misbehavior if World Series reaches game 6, when Clemens would be likely to take mound again</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Even the most ardent Yankee fans were unsettled by the behavior of Roger Clemens in the opening moments of Sunday's World Series game, when the pitcher threw a large, jagged piece of broken bat across the path of the Mets' Mike Piazza. It skittered by without hitting Piazza, but even so the umpires would have been justified in ejecting Clemens from the game. They made a judgment call not to do so, probably because they did not want to disrupt a championship game. That was an understandable decision, but Major League Baseball should make clear to Clemens that it will not tolerate any further misconduct during the Series.</p>
        <p>Umpires and referees usually give professional athletes a bit more latitude in championship contests to insure unfettered competition. Since Clemens's intent was unknowable to the umpiring crew, and no one was hurt in the incident, his ejection would have been a severe step that would have deprived the Yankees of one of their most effective starting pitchers before the end of the first inning. He went on to limit the Mets to two hits and no runs over eight innings.</p>

        <p>Even the most ardent Yankee fans were unsettled by the behavior of Roger Clemens in the opening moments of Sunday's World Series game, when the pitcher threw a large, jagged piece of broken bat across the path of the Mets' Mike Piazza. It skittered by without hitting Piazza, but even so the umpires would have been justified in ejecting Clemens from the game. They made a judgment call not to do so, probably because they did not want to disrupt a championship game. That was an understandable decision, but Major League Baseball should make clear to Clemens that it will not tolerate any further misconduct during the Series.</p>
        <p>Umpires and referees usually give professional athletes a bit more latitude in championship contests to insure unfettered competition. Since Clemens's intent was unknowable to the umpiring crew, and no one was hurt in the incident, his ejection would have been a severe step that would have deprived the Yankees of one of their most effective starting pitchers before the end of the first inning. He went on to limit the Mets to two hits and no runs over eight innings.</p>
        <p>Still, throwing a sharp piece of lumber in the direction of another player could have had disastrous consequences. None of Clemens's explanations seem satisfactory, including the idea that he somehow mistook the bat for the ball.</p>
        <p>Clemens plays at a high level of intensity, and has overpowered hitters for almost two decades, earning a record five Cy Young awards. His fastball often hurtles toward home plate at nearly 100 miles an hour. But Clemens also has a record of volcanic behavior, and it is in that light that Sunday's incident seems more ominous.</p>
        <p>It is important to distinguish between fair and foul forms of intimidation at the ballpark. Clemens is hardly the first fastball pitcher to direct a speeding baseball high and inside to brush batters back from the plate and plant fear in their minds. That is how hardball is played in the major leagues. But aiming to hit a batter, especially to strike a player on the head, crosses the line and under baseball rules can get a pitcher ejected. Throwing a broken bat in anger, which seemed to be the case on Sunday, can fall into the same category.</p>
        <p>Clemens has always competed close to the line, and this summer one of his fastballs collided with Piazza's head during an inter-league game at Yankee Stadium. He said it was unintentional and he was not ejected from the game. But that incident may well have been Piazza's reward for hitting well against Clemens over the years, including several titanic home runs. Given that history, Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, would be wise to notify the Yankees that Clemens has no margin for misbehavior if the World Series reaches game 6, when Clemens would be likely to take the mound again.</p>
