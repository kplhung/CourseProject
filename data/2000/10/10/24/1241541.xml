        <p>Wesla Whitfield  Arci's Place</p>
        <p>A sly critical humor and a piercing pathos are qualities that rarely coincide in a single performance. Yet a continually shifting blend of wit and sadness -- almost a double vision -- is precisely what Wesla Whitfield projects. The matronly pop-jazz singer, who is appearing through Nov. 4, calls her new show ''Lucky to Be Me.'' It's not a random title. The show exhibits an acute intelligence and wry self-possession.</p>
        <p>Ms. Whitfield's parched crisp of a voice, with its acidic edges, is definitely an acquired taste. But once acquired, it has the cutting impact of an extra-dry gin martini. (Make that a double.) Every crevice and corner of her instrument conveys a different, quirky shading. When she opens up and elongates her vowels, a caustic observation can suddenly deepen and broaden into a plaintive metaphysical cry.</p>
        <p>At her most daring, Ms. Whitfield insinuates new meanings into familiar lyrics. Although her act's title song, from the musical ''On the Town,'' celebrates the euphoria of finding true love, Ms. Whitfield turns it into an anthem about learning to love yourself, gaining serenity and letting go. Several of the show's selections are from ''Guys and Dolls.'' And here again she skillfully lifts them out of their slangy context and makes them universal.</p>
        <p>The singer is accompanied on piano and bass by Mike Greensill and Steve LaSpina. Their spare, hushed arrangements leave her plenty of room to spin out her complicated, double-edged reflections.</p>
