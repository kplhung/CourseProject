        <p>The presidential race has gotten so interesting that people are losing track of that Other Election here in New York. Fear not, I'm prepared to take questions.</p>
        <p>So is Hillary Clinton going to show up for the World Series in her Yankee hat?</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton says she is having trouble fitting it into her schedule. This is actually a reasonable excuse, since she could make a swing through the entire Finger Lakes region in the time it takes a Mets pitcher to retire one batter.</p>
        <p>I can't believe you could be disrespectful about the Subway Series.</p>
        <p>Please. Baseball is the only thing in the world that drags on longer than the presidential elections.</p>
        <p>Now that it's almost over, how would you say Mrs. Clinton has been doing as a Senate candidate?</p>
        <p>Whatever happens on Nov. 7, Hillary -- she wants us to call her Hillary -- has won one battle. She's made most New Yorkers forget how weird her situation is, that we've got a sitting first lady campaigning for the Senate in a state she never lived in before. Ten thousand health care symposiums and trips to dairy farms and tours of multi-ethnic elementary schools later, we're beaten down. We can't remember a single thing she's said over the last year and a half, but we've grown accustomed to her pitch.</p>
        <p>Do you think she could have done as well if she'd run for Senate from Illinois?</p>
        <p>Well, New Yorkers are better than most people at getting used to peculiar situations. This is, you'll remember, a city whose first lady is currently howling about her private parts Off Broadway, while her husband the mayor marches in ethnic parades with a first-lady-in-waiting. We have come to think of this as normal, and one additional first lady would hardly make a dent.</p>
        <p>Did you believe President Clinton when he said that of all the races he's ever been in, he never wanted to win one as much as he wants Hillary to win the Senate seat?</p>
        <p>I absolutely believe that Mr. Clinton cares more about today's race than last year's.</p>
        <p>Does Senator Charles Schumer look forward to having Mrs. Clinton as his junior senator?</p>
        <p>Yes, Senator Schumer is very excited about the possibility of sharing the stage with the most famous woman on the planet. He is undoubtedly looking forward to having Mrs. Clinton take over tiresome duties such as appearing on Sunday morning talk shows, being interviewed on the nightly news and holding well-attended press conferences, leaving him free to devote his time to upstate economic development.</p>
        <p>What happens to New York if Hillary Clinton wins and the Republicans take the White House and Congress?</p>
        <p>With two Democratic senators, one of them Mrs. Clinton, the state would not necessarily be at the front of the line when it comes time to divvy up the road-building projects. Perhaps we will change the state motto from ''Excelsior'' to ''Cave Lacunas in Viis'' (''Watch out for potholes'').</p>
        <p>What happened to Rick Lazio? I thought he was going to be such a great candidate.</p>
        <p>There's still a chance he can pull this off, in which case we will look back on Mr. Lazio as a terrific campaigner who made a canny choice in devoting most of his rhetorical energy to descriptions of how his immigrant grandmother used to stir the tomato sauce. But it is not a good sign that in the Lazio ad where he visits an elementary school, your first impression is that Rick is a member of the student body.</p>
        <p>When Al Gore invaded George W. Bush's space, everybody thought it was a great macho move, but when Mr. Lazio did it to Mrs. Clinton, he got killed. Do you think that's fair?</p>
        <p>Nothing about campaigns is fair. It isn't fair that the vice president could lose the presidency because he's cursed with a dorky demeanor. It isn't fair that women who have been in public life for decades still get letters from their constituents about their haircuts. However, to be totally comparable, you'd have had to have a debate in which Al Gore invaded the space of, say, Liddy Dole, just after one member of an all-male panel of journalists asked her a really mean question about those Viagra commercials.</p>
        <p>Who do you think it would be cooler to be on Halloween, Hillary, Gore or Bush?</p>
        <p>I'm sorry, this is further than I can push the concept of cool. If you want to do something political, go as a Fuzzy Number.</p>
