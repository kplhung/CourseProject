        <p>For a passing moment during his  presentation of General Electric's $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell International yesterday, John F.

        <p>Being mentioned by one of America's most legendary executives was undoubtedly gratifying for Mr. Boisi, but it was probably even more rewarding for his bosses at Chase, which spent about $450 million last spring to buy Mr. Boisi's advisory boutique, the Beacon Group.

The cost of that acquisition, as well as Chase's purchase of Robert Fleming, a London-based investment bank, helped Chase's investment banking expenses balloon 47 percent in the third quarter.</p>

        <p>For a passing moment during his  presentation of General Electric's $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell International yesterday, John F. Welch Jr. interrupted himself to tip his hat to one of the men behind his biggest deal ever: his banker, Geoff Boisi, the head of investment banking at Chase Manhattan and the soon-to-be co-chief executive of J. P. Morgan investment banking.</p>
        <p>Being mentioned by one of America's most legendary executives was undoubtedly gratifying for Mr. Boisi, but it was probably even more rewarding for his bosses at Chase, which spent about $450 million last spring to buy Mr. Boisi's advisory boutique, the Beacon Group. By all measures, Mr. Boisi did not come cheap. The cost of that acquisition, as well as Chase's purchase of Robert Fleming, a London-based investment bank, helped Chase's investment banking expenses balloon 47 percent in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>But the G.E.-Honeywell deal is no doubt gratifying for the lift it gives Chase's banking business, especially as it tries to sell its purchase of J. P. Morgan to investors. ''It's like the papal blessing on our deal with J. P. Morgan,'' Mr. Boisi said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Chase has been moving up in the mergers and acquisitions advisory rankings. Even without taking into account its coming merger with J. P. Morgan, Chase ranks sixth in announced deals this year, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. That is up from 13th place for all of last year. But by advising G.E., Chase is trying to demonstrate that it can win the bluest of blue-chip clients. ''Chase in recent months has been talking about getting invited into advisory relationships that are not contingent upon financing,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch who follows Chase's stock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boisi's predecessor as investment banking chief, James Lee, was a strong advocate of ''one-stop shopping,'' where Chase would use its ability to arrange loans and high-yield bonds to win advisory business.</p>
        <p>Even before Mr. Boisi joined Chase, the firm was making strides at winning deals independent of its balance sheet, said Susan Roth, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. But with Mr. Boisi and the new team of investment bankers the firm will gain through its acquisition of J. P. Morgan, the firm should make even greater strides, she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boisi added yesterday that his new colleagues at J. P. Morgan were a big help, noting the firm represented Allied Signal in its $15 billion merger with Honeywell in July 1999. Lawrence A. Bossidy, the former chief executive of Allied Signal, is on Morgan's board, and J. P. Morgan's chief executive, Douglas A. Warner III, is on G.E.'s board.</p>
        <p>In deference to his boss for the deal-making frenzy, Mr. Welch, Mr. Boisi tippped his hat as well. ''I've been doing this for a long time,'' he said. ''The last 48 hour were among the most exciting of my career.''</p>
