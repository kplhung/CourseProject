        <p>Compact video cameras emerged from tote bags, and silver cameras were whisked from the folds of dark suits as the visitors from Hubei Province in China took turns sidling up to an oversized statue and posing with shy half-smiles.</p>
        <p>They were not standing beside the Statue of Liberty or a hand-painted cow, but admiring a bronze statue depicting a police officer protecting a child. The sculpture greets those who enter a building that many civilians would rather avoid but that foreign police officials are flocking to with increasing ardor: the downtown headquarters of the New York Police Department.</p>
        <p>Alone or by the busload, the officials are trekking to New York to study how the city was able to shake its reputation for out-of-control crime and become what the Giuliani administration says is one of the safest large cities in the United States.</p>
        <p>Dressed in staid business suits, in gleaming white uniforms or even with hats topped with red plumes, foreign visitors gather in the lobby of 1 Police Plaza and cram into halting elevators with detectives and deliverymen. They come from South Korea, Norway and Botswana, bearing gifts of plaques, caps and pins.</p>
        <p>They listen intently as officials from the New York Police Department brief them on favorable statistics, and as their translators struggle with the catchy acronyms of crime-fighting strategies. They soak in slides and jot down notes at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice as professors recount the storied success of the city that cleaned itself up.</p>
        <p>Since the beginning of the year, at least 235 police departments, about 85 percent of them from outside the country, have sent delegations to the New York Police Department, said Lt. David Nadel, the commanding officer of the chief of department's liaison unit. Last year, at least 221 delegations descended upon 1 Police Plaza for briefings, meetings and crash courses in New York-style policing. In 1998, representatives of at least 219 police departments, more than 150 of them from other countries, journeyed to the big brick building by the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
        <p>Some New Yorkers, while appreciative of the falling crime rate, are also distrustful of the department, which has been accused of using excessive force, especially against minority residents, in recent years.</p>
        <p>A recent poll commissioned by the City Council showed that 42 percent of blacks interviewed and 36 percent of Hispanics said that they would feel fearful or somewhat concerned when seeing a police officer walk toward them. The department also faces the possibility of a federal monitor as a result of an investigation into accusations that it fails to properly discipline officers in brutality cases.</p>
        <p>Some visiting officials, however, like Superintendent Eamon Lynch of the Garda Siochana, the Irish national police, say the department's problems are added draws, not detractions, and can be instructive.</p>
        <p>''We will face the same problems that you face in 5 years or 10 years,'' said Superintendent Lynch, who added that he squeezed in an appointment with the Rodin sculptures at the Metropolitan Museum of Art each time police business brought him to the city.</p>
        <p>The delegation of 19 high-ranking police officials from Hubei Province in east central China was one of the most recent groups to tour the halls of New York law enforcement. They were polite, dutifully impressed, and just as dutifully resistant to admit that there might be anything wrong with their own way of doing things.</p>
        <p>''We just have a short training at John Jay College,'' said Shang Wu, a  deputy commissioner of the Public Security Department for Hubei. ''It's very convenient for us to visit the New York Police Department.''</p>
        <p>He was asked whether there were any challenges back home that he hoped to address during the visit. ''No,'' Mr. Shang said abruptly. ''We think our method, our way, is quite efficient.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, officials from the department made their case, displaying charts and serving up statistics. ''The New York City you see today is not the New York City you saw 10 years ago,'' said Chief Charles V. Campisi, as the delegates scrawled diligently into small notebooks. ''We were able to reduce crime in New York to the lowest level it has been in decades, to where New York City now is the safest large city in the United States.''</p>
        <p>Some of the police lingo was a challenge for the group's translator from China, Xiong Hua. ''Proactive?'' he repeated, pausing briefly before settling on a suitable equivalent.</p>
        <p>At 911 headquarters in downtown Brooklyn, the delegates gazed through a glass panel at operators, dressed in ordinary slacks and shirts and prone to chatting with one another between calls. ''In our country, it's policemen and policewomen who do this kind of work,'' said Mr. Shang, diplomatically adding, ''Maybe you have your reasons for having civilians working for the police.''</p>
        <p>The New York Police Department had a different kind of allure a decade ago, said Donna Shirreffs, who coordinates the State Department's own international visitors program in New York. Back then, visitors exhibited what one State Department official called the Kojak Syndrome. They were eager to strap themselves into police cars as officers chased down gun-wielding culprits, but were less enthusiastic about observing number-crunching sessions.</p>
        <p>''Now we get these international visitors that come in and start asking for some serious appointments,'' Ms. Shirreffs said.</p>
        <p>Even so, a group of young bureaucrats and businesspeople from France recently requested a joy ride in a police helicopter, Ms. Shirreffs said. ''They were gracefully denied it,'' she said. ''It was because they were so excited about their visit with the New York police.''</p>
        <p>Nearly every week, one lecturer or another from John Jay addresses visiting law enforcement officials, said Jerry Capeci, a John Jay spokesman. John Jay organized the itinerary of the recent delegation from Hubei, making dates at courthouses and headquarters and offering pizza parlor recommendations.</p>
        <p>Next month, another Chinese delegation is due for a series of lectures on cybercrime, and eight police officers and detectives from the Turkish National Police are enrolled at John Jay this fall.</p>
        <p>The director of the college's Criminal Justice Center, Prof. Robert J. Louden, acknowledged that he sometimes feels like a seventh-grade social studies teacher as presentations on crime-fighting turn into civics lessons on the complicated network of courts, police departments and federal agencies that underpin American democracy.</p>
        <p>''The standard question is, 'Well, why don't you people change your country to make it more manageable?' '' Professor Louden said. ''They can't understand how we get anything done.''</p>
        <p>Police officials from South Korea come to New York at least once a year to pick up crime-fighting crime-busting tips, Lieutenant Nadel said.</p>
        <p>''New York police do very excellent work,'' said Lee Han Myeong, a senior superintendent in the Korean police force who is based at the consulate here. ''New York police are known by the Korean police agency as a success in reforming policies.''</p>
        <p>Compstat, the computer mapping system that tracks crime patterns, is something of a departmental treasure at 1 Police Plaza, and the Koreans are impressed. ''The Korean police agencies are interested in that very much,'' Superintendent Lee said. ''By the Compstat, the N.Y.P.D. was advanced much to analyze the crime rate and the crime trends. They can deploy police power to the weak points.''</p>
        <p>In Korea, the police are now trying to institute a version of Compstat, Superintendent Lee said. What will they call the import? ''We can say just 'Compstat,' but in Korean characters.''</p>
        <p>Not every police official who visits goes home preaching the New York gospel. And as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his Police Department are not without their critics at home, their signature strategies have also sparked debate overseas.</p>
        <p>''The language and policy of New York has had a negative impact here,'' said Dr. Scott Poynting, a senior lecturer at the University of Western Sydney who is the co-author of a recently published book that discusses the impact on Sydney's Arabic-speaking population of the zero-tolerance approach to petty crime.</p>
        <p>''They talk about owning the streets and in quite an aggressive, macho, way, about taking control of the streets and this sort of thing. When they do that, they alienate a whole community which they could instead be looking to for collaboration to keep good law and order.''</p>
        <p>And then there were the delegates from Moscow, who scoffed in Russian that the decline in crime could not possibly be as dramatic as the New York police officials had said. Sharing their skepticism with their interpreter, the delegates made a faux pas.</p>
        <p>''They forgot that we had had a detective join us who speaks Russian,'' Lieutenant Nadel said. ''He told us later.''</p>
