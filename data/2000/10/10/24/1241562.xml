        <p>In the 1940's and 50's, bats didn't shatter the way Mike Piazza's did Sunday night in Game 2 of the World Series against Roger Clemens.</p>
        <p>''Back then, we were allowed six bats a season and they were like iron,'' Phil Rizzuto, the former Yankee shortstop and broadcaster, said at Mickey Mantle's restaurant yesterday. ''They never did splinter back then.''</p>
        <p>Rizzuto is convinced that Clemens did not intend to hit Piazza by hurling one of the pieces of the bat at him. ''He didn't take it and aim it at Piazza, but at the Yankee dugout,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Rizzuto appeared at a news conference to promote a World Series autograph show with the Brooklyn Dodgers' Ralph Branca, the New York Giants' Bobby Thomson, Bill Buckner of the Boston Red Sox, and the Mets' Mookie Wilson and Tommie Agee.</p>
        <p>Buckner, whose first season with the Red Sox, 1984, coincided with Clemens's rookie year, said: ''I don't think what he did was right. I don't think he'd do it again. In the heat of battle, you can do some dumb things.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he was throwing the bat at Piazza, but I think he was throwing near him. If I were Mike Piazza, I would have been in his face and taken one for the team.''</p>
