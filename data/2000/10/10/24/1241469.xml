        <p>As New Jersey officials move to consolidate their takeover of Camden, federal prosecutors yesterday opened the trial of the city's beleaguered mayor. A conviction would force Mayor Milton Milan to leave office, simplifying the state's task of persuading the rest of city government to cooperate.</p>
        <p>At the start of jury selection, seven people were qualified for the jury pool in the trial, which is expected to last four to six weeks. Opening arguments are scheduled for Nov. 6.</p>
        <p>Much of the case against the mayor was obtained with the help of a former Philadelphia crime boss, Ralph Natale, who is under indictment himself and is cooperating with the prosecution.</p>
        <p>The indictment of the mayor, issued in March, charges that a Natale associate gave Mr. Milan more than $30,000 in exchange for help in funneling city business to Cosa Nostra-controlled businesses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Natale is in prison on a narcotics conspiracy conviction, and prosecutors did not rule out the possibility yesterday that Mr. Natale would take the stand against Mr. Milan.</p>
        <p>The trial begins as the state government and a nearly paralyzed city government are bickering over the state's efforts to assume day-to-day control of the city, which is New Jersey's poorest.</p>
        <p>The state intends to bypass the City Council and impose a business manager to run Camden. So state officials have privately welcomed the start of the trial as a way of focusing residents' attention on what the state regards as a pressing need for reform. In a possible shift in that direction, the City Council recently passed a resolution calling on Mr. Milan, 37, to resign, after it twice rejected similar motions.</p>
        <p>But Council members, unwilling to seem supportive of the state's takeover plans, said their vote was motivated by Mr. Milan's long and unexplained absences from office, not his indictment and trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milan's lawyer, Carlos A. Martir, Jr., filed eight motions to delay the trial this month, saying he needed more time to review federal evidence. All were rejected by Judge Joel A. Pisano of Federal District Court, the trial judge in the case. Mr. Milan has pleaded not guilty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milan's indictment grew out of the federal government's long-running corruption, drug dealing and money laundering investigation in Camden and Philadelphia, which lies just across the Delaware River. Sixteen local men have been convicted or pleaded guilty to narcotics charges. The city's former municipal prosecutor, Joseph S. Caruso, has admitted to conspiring with Mr. Milan to solicit a $5,000 campaign contribution from the public defender.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milan's business partner in the Atlas Construction Company has also been indicted on money laundering charges.</p>
        <p>The federal indictment describes Mr. Milan as a man intent on taking mostly small bites, but lots of them. He accepted a central air-conditioning system, wall-to-wall carpeting and new windows in his Camden house in exchange for expediting payments to city vendors, for example, the authorities charge.</p>
        <p>In another incident, he is accused of stealing computers from his construction company to claim the insurance, and then sold one of the computers to a young intern at City Hall.</p>
