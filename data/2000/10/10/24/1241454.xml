        <p>Hours after President Clinton signed a bill requiring states to adopt a lower blood alcohol level as the legal threshold for drunken driving, law enforcement and elected officials in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut said today that they planned to urge lawmakers to pass such laws in the months ahead.</p>
        <p>The law, approved this month by Congress as part of a $58 billion transportation spending bill, requires states to either adopt the new  standard -- which declares drivers legally drunk when their blood alcohol level reaches 0.08 percent -- by 2007 or lose millions in federal transportation grants each year.</p>
        <p>In the three states in the New York region, the blood alcohol limit is 0.10 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said the new law, if adopted by states nationwide, would be ''a common-sense way'' to save some 500 lives a year. Last year, he said, 15,700 people, including more than 2,200 children, died in alcohol-related vehicle crashes.</p>
        <p>The law penalizes states that do not adopt the 0.08 standard by 2004, cutting off 2 percent of their highway financing. The penalty will climb to 8 percent by 2007, but states that adopt the federal standard by that year will get back any money withheld by the federal government.</p>
        <p>Eighteen states and Washington, D.C., have already adopted the new blood alcohol level as their standard for drunken driving. But 31 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, have a 0.10 limit. (In Massachusetts, a level of 0.08 is considered evidence, but not proof, of drunkenness.)</p>
        <p>In states where 0.10 percent is still the legal limit, legislatures will need to pass their own laws to enforce the lower federal standard -- or risk losing substantial amounts of money.</p>
        <p>New York, for example, would lose more than $18 million, New Jersey would lose about $10.5 million and Connecticut would forfeit $5.7 million, said Kathryn Henry, a spokeswoman for the United States Department of Transportation.</p>
        <p>Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut, said Mr. Rowland has supported lowering the blood alcohol level in the past, but would not comment on any new measure until he could review it.</p>
        <p>In 1998, a bill to lower the legal limit for drunken driving in the state to 0.08 percent died in the House. Last year, the State Legislature passed a law that allows anyone previously convicted of driving drunk to be arrested for subsequent offenses if they have a blood alcohol level of only 0.07 percent.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, home to Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a major proponent of the new federal limit, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has not yet considered the new law, said her spokesman, Pete McDonough.</p>
        <p>''We have not discussed it,'' Mr. McDonough said today. ''Point oh-eight has been a highly charged issue in New Jersey for a long time. It's hard to predict what will happen or when it will happen.''</p>
        <p>In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki has voiced support in the past for legislation, which failed in the Legislature, that would have lowered the state's limit to 0.08. Asked today whether Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver would support a new law, his spokeswoman, Patricia Lynch, said Mr. Silver would ''not allow that amount of federal dollars to be lost'' through the state's refusing the lower limit.</p>
        <p>Though lowering the legal blood alcohol level is as a rule a politically popular position, not everyone favors the new law. Many state legislators have battled over efforts to lower the limit for years.</p>
        <p>The National Restaurant Association issued a statement today opposing the 0.08 level, saying that most fatal alcohol-related crashes involve levels far in excess of that figure.</p>
