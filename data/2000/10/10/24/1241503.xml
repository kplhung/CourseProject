        <p>Here is a statement that may be used against me in divorce proceedings: I need the Mets to win.</p>
        <p>There is no fun in a Subway Sweep. We march around town, winning postseason game after game, making teams from every coast look like Little League. It seems mean. Stale. And most of all, it is just not that fun.</p>
        <p>I stopped in a diner near the Lincoln Tunnel on my way to New Jersey on Sunday, and saw a great cross section of New York. Burly men with cell phones and Marlboros on the counter, putting away fried eggs. Young Chelsea types ending their Saturday night over coffee at noon. A handful of city workers, and people who arrived, oddly enough, in limos. A third of the room was in baseball caps. Sports sections were everywhere.</p>
        <p>Making our way back that night, my husband and I stopped at a light and saw a dozen people in a parking garage staring in one direction. Altercation? Of course not! First inning. A city divided, in this case, is a city united. Who wants it to end?</p>
        <p>My first experience with the Bat Incident took place in the car. We pulled up to our apartment and parked long enough to hear the now infamous at-bat. What a strange moment -- the roar of fans seemingly hoping for something weird -- and Roger Clemens delivering it.</p>
        <p>You hear a bench clearing over the radio and there are several long seconds during which you have no idea what is going on. You imagine Derek Jeter with a bloody nose, and Paul O'Neill with a water cooler lifted over his head.</p>
        <p>My evil instincts took over. O.K., Metsies, buck up with anger. Fight back. Put the hurt on Freaky Roger, and force us to dig into the bullpen and fall apart.</p>
        <p>''I think Clemens is a lunatic,'' mused my friend Kate Hinds, perhaps the most loyal Yankee fan I know. ''Didn't he always vow he could never play for New York? He is good for the Series, but he is not good for the team.'' And by the way, she wants the Mets to win, too. ''I don't want Mets fans to have the chance to start whining about how they are so young or whatever. And I want a good Series.''</p>
        <p>We then stop to ponder the idea of that silly eagle flying into the stands and raking the scalp of an unsuspecting fan.</p>
        <p>But I could use fewer games like Saturday night's. Why was it that my 19-month-old picked then to scream on and off for two and a half hours that she no longer wanted to sleep in her crib? The crying and carrying on took me from my bedroom to hers at least a dozen times, so I missed watching Mike Piazza get picked off. And yes, I fell asleep during some of the best parts -- who didn't?</p>
        <p>Among my baby's 11 p.m. rants: ''I want watch baseball!'' I think she is a little young to be making that decree, but she may as well learn early on that her chance of viewing a postseason game before age 13 is dim. You can ask your God to rain down the plague of your choice on the network television and Major League Baseball executives who combined forces to make that so. I will be saving my prayers for Queens.</p>
