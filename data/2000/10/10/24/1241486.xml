        <p>The Mets waited 14 years to get back to the World Series, and several veterans had waited nearly as long or longer to experience baseball's showcase. But the Series could be over by tomorrow night, and all the talk is about a nasty incident that is not going away.</p>
        <p>Some of the Mets were upset that so much of the attention before this World Series was about the pending confrontation between Mike Piazza and the Yankees' Roger Clemens, who beaned Piazza in July. So the players watched in amazement Sunday as Clemens took the bait.</p>
        <p>In the first inning of Game 2, Clemens fired Piazza's broken bat toward him after a foul ball. The benches emptied, but the Mets did not really retaliate, and Clemens shut them out for eight innings in a 6-5 decision that gave the Yankees a two-games-to-none Series lead.</p>
        <p>''Roger Clemens has not intimidated our ball club,'' Piazza said. ''It was not an act of intimidation. The guy pitched a good game, No. 1. It's unfortunate that this incident takes precedence over the ballgame. No. 2, what is intimidation? I mean, it's idiotic.</p>
        <p>''I went out to confront him about it and, obviously, he chose to -- whatever his excuse was. As far as demanding an apology, an apology is only as good as where the source is coming from. So I really couldn't care less about an apology or anything else. It was a stupid situation. What can you say?</p>
        <p>''So we reacted -- you could argue left and right. You're damned if you do, damned if you don't. We punch him, get guys thrown out, we're selfish. We back down, we're -- whatever, we look gutless. So what is there to say?''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Clemens said: ''I was taking a bat and throwing it to our on-deck circle. I wish it would have been somebody completely different -- then it wouldn't have meant anything. I don't want to revisit it.''</p>
        <p>For the Mets, a victory in Game 3 tonight is crucial. If they lose, there is no precedent for a comeback. Twenty-five teams in baseball history have been in an 0-3 deficit in four-of-seven-game postseason series. All of those teams, including the 1999 Mets in the National League Championship Series, have lost the series.</p>
        <p>''It's a must-win tomorrow,'' Piazza said. ''We can't afford to go down, 3-0. We've been down, 3-0, to the Braves and we almost came back and evened the series. But that's extremely difficult to do.''</p>
        <p>Making the task tougher is Orlando Hernandez, the Yankees' Game 3 starter. Hernandez has appeared in 10 career postseason games, and the Yankees have won every time. The Mets right-hander Rick Reed, who was hit hard in his start against St. Louis in the N.L.C.S., opposes him.</p>
        <p>The Mets have experience beating top pitchers. They beat Darryl Kile twice in the N.L.C.S., and they beat Atlanta's Greg Maddux three times and Arizona's Randy Johnson twice during the regular season. ''Sometimes when we've had our backs against the wall facing one of the best pitchers in the game, we've had our best games,'' center fielder Jay Payton said.</p>
        <p>The Mets spoke like that for hours yesterday, when they worked out at Shea Stadium on an off day. They sounded confident and optimistic while acknowledging, in reliever Turk Wendell's words, the Yankees' ''magical kind of karma.'' But they say they are oblivious to the Yankees' October mystique. ''We need to make a few better pitches, make a few better plays in the field,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''Maybe keep one fair or hit one a foot or two farther. That would help, too.''</p>
        <p>Valentine was referring to Lenny Harris's deep foul down the left-field line in Game 2 and two shots by Todd Zeile that missed clearing the left-field fence by inches. The Mets are becoming the latest team to be foiled by the Yankees in October, left to contemplate the breaks that always seem to go the Yankees' way.</p>
        <p>''All those things you can look at and say, 'God, that might have been the difference in the game,' '' Zeile said. ''But I'm a firm believer that every time you're on the losing end of it, you feel like the other team got the breaks. You've got to get away from that excuse-making and go out and make your own.''</p>
        <p>Clemens pitched an outstanding game Sunday, but when the Mets chose not to retaliate -- ''What are we supposed to do to Clemens?'' catcher Todd Pratt asked. ''Go jump him and dog-pile him?'' -- their desire to beat him intensified so much that it worked in Clemens's favor. Harris and Zeile both said the Mets were too aggressive and swung at bad pitches because they were trying so hard to get back at Clemens.</p>
        <p>Like Piazza, some of the other Mets were incredulous over suggestions that they should have brawled with Clemens in such a setting.</p>
        <p>''In the sense of it being the World Series and playing for the world championship, we handled it the right way,'' Darryl Hamilton said. ''If it's any other circumstance, it'd be nice to get out there and do something a little bit more than what happened.''</p>
        <p>If Harris were in Piazza's position, he said, he would have charged after Clemens. Piazza did not, and Harris said that was the professional way to handle it. Mike Hampton, who opposed Clemens on Sunday night, said his emotions would have overwhelmed logic.</p>
        <p>''If I was hitting and someone would have thrown the bat at me, I would have fought -- bottom line,'' Hampton said. ''I don't care if Mike Tyson was pitching, I would have had to go out there and take a whipping.''</p>
        <p>But Piazza has never charged the mound; he prefers to look at the pitcher for his reaction, and the one he got from Clemens was puzzling.</p>
        <p>''He seemed extremely apologetic and unsure and confused and unstable,'' Piazza said. Mainly, though, Piazza said he preferred to keep his emotions private, and he seemed to be holding back yesterday.</p>
        <p>Other Mets were less guarded, ridiculing Clemens and speaking of their lost respect for him, as they did after the incident in July. Pratt, who came up in the Red Sox organization, said: ''I idolized Roger. He's tainted that idolization the last two instances I've seen him pitch.''</p>
        <p>Wendell, like many of his teammates, struggled to understand what Clemens meant when he said he thought the bat was the ball: ''What is this, Wiffle ball, where you throw the ball at the guy? I know the difference between a bat and a baseball.''</p>
        <p>Zeile, who said Sunday that Clemens could not have intended to throw the bat at Piazza, said yesterday that after he watched the replay, Clemens's actions seemed more blatant. But if his teammates need Sunday's incident for motivation, Zeile said, they ''need to find a different job.''</p>
        <p>Valentine has been diplomatic, supporting Piazza without criticizing Clemens directly. He said he did not feel the need to address his players. ''Maybe it's something to fester,'' Valentine said. ''Maybe it's something to hold on to. We'll take this day to let it simmer and see where it is tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>But Harris said the Mets have to let it go.</p>
        <p>''We have to overlook it,'' he said. ''It's going to be hard because everyone came in with the same attitude of being upset about it. We just have to get rid of it and play Mets baseball.''</p>
