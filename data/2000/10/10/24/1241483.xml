        <p>The Nebraska Cornhuskers (7-0) are No. 1 and the Oklahoma Sooners (6-0) are No. 2 in this season's first Bowl Championship Series ranking, which was released yesterday. But their rankings are certain to change after the two teams meet on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Until its final ranking, to determine which teams play for the national title game at the Orange Bowl on Jan. 3, the B.C.S. is an occasional index of the reporters and coaches polls and computer rankings. It also gauges each team's strength of schedule.</p>
        <p>Two Big East teams, Virginia Tech (7-0) and Miami (5-1), are next in the ranking at No. 3 and No. 4. They, too, are set to play each other on Nov. 4, so expect wholesale shuffling in the next couple of weeks. The Hokies' schedule is currently judged the 13th toughest in the country, while the Hurricanes' is 3rd toughest, accounting for the strong showing despite one loss.</p>
        <p>The two other undefeated teams in the ranking are much lower: Clemson (8-0) and Texas Christian (6-0). The Tigers' B.C.S. ranking is seventh primarily because their schedule ranks 97th. A victory against No. 5 Florida State (7-1) on Nov. 4 would move them up.</p>
        <p>The Horned Frogs, No. 13 in the B.C.S. ranking, are hampered by a schedule that ranks 109th. They won't get much of a boost with games against Rice, San Jose State, Fresno State, Texas-El Paso and Southern Methodist.</p>
