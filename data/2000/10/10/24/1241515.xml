        <p>Faced with rising gasoline prices, a slowing market for large sport utilities and intense pressure from its corporate parent in Germany to cut costs, the American operations of DaimlerChrysler have changed plans for future models, said a person familiar with the plans. The former Chrysler operations have canceled plans to build a full-sized Dodge sport utility vehicle and will make fewer costly design changes than previously planned in the next Jeep Grand Cherokee, the person said. The big Dodge vehicle, which would have competed with the Chevrolet Suburban and Ford Excursion, has been repeatedly canceled and then revived over the last seven years. Ward's Automotive Reports reported the Dodge plans over the weekend, while Reuters reported yesterday that the next Grand Cherokee would not be heavily redesigned.</p>
