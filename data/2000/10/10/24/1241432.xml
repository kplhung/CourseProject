        <p>YOU might think Subway Series tickets are hopelessly unaffordable, but let's put the price in perspective. Would you rather attend tonight's baseball game or spend a weekend in Atlantic City? Would you rather take your child to the Subway Series or to Disney World?</p>
        <p>Would you rather sit in the mezzanine at Shea Stadium tonight or in an orchestra seat at the Metropolitan Opera's ''Ring'' cycle? Would you rather sit in the upper level tonight than buy a new television?</p>
        <p>If you're at all tempted by the game, there's one more crucial question: Do you live in New York State?</p>
        <p>If so, forget it. Your choice has already been made for you by New York politicians, including the ones who will be at tonight's game. They're entitled to tickets, either free or at a fraction of their market value, but you can't legally buy them at any price unless you have connections like theirs.</p>
        <p>Politicians in the city and the state have done such a good job of driving out street scalpers and licensed brokers that you can't find tickets to the Subway Series near a subway. You must go to New Jersey or Connecticut and pretend to be a suburbanite, because even the out-of-state brokers are afraid of being prosecuted by our zealous officials if they sell to a New Yorker.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, licensed brokers in the suburbs were legally selling upper-level seats for tonight's game for $500 apiece. Seats in the mezzanine were going for $1,000. You can probably get a better deal today, because prices tend to fall on the day of the game.</p>
        <p>But even if the prices don't fall, paying $500 for a once-in-a-lifetime event is not an absurd extravagance. I wouldn't pay that for a baseball ticket, but there are plenty of devoted fans who would be glad to sacrifice a vacation or an appliance for a game they would never forget.</p>
        <p>In New York, though, it's illegal to sell tickets at market value. City police officers have been so strict on street scalpers in recent years that they've even arrested ordinary fans outside Yankee Stadium trying to unload an extra ticket. They arrested dozens of scalpers over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, politicians in Albany, notably the Democrats in the Assembly, have insisted on extending a law forbidding the resale of tickets for more than 10 percent above face value. Besides forcing brokers to flee to the suburbs, the law has stifled sales on the Internet. Officials at eBay have canceled auctions of World Series tickets to comply with the New York law against mark-ups.</p>
        <p>While ticket brokers operate freely in most states, in New York they're routinely denounced by politicians and journalists who claim to be defenders of the ordinary fan. But for most ordinary fans, the only realistic hope of getting into the Subway Series is through a ticket broker. Most seats are set aside for season ticket holders and people with connections -- like politicians and journalists.</p>
        <p>TEAMS in the playoffs like to pretend that they're catering to the masses by offering a few tickets to people who line up at the box office or telephone at the right moment. It's good public relations. But what about the other fans who can't camp out and don't win the telephone lottery? The noncelebrities who can't call in favors and don't have access to the stash of tickets that city and state politicians dip into for the big games?</p>
        <p>The unconnected need brokers to wangle tickets for them, mainly by transferring seats from season ticket holders. It's a mutually beneficial transaction for the fans (not to mention the broker), because the season ticket holder who is willing to miss a playoff game turns a profit by transferring the seat to a fan who values it more.</p>
        <p>By discouraging these transactions, New York politicians keep tickets off the open market, which only drives up the prices. If New York's law were miraculously repealed today, increasing the supply of tickets on the market, prices would fall for the rest of the Subway Series.</p>
        <p>That's not going to happen, but the ticket law expires in June, and at least some officials are contemplating a change. Unlike his predecessors as attorney general, who eagerly sought publicity for their crusades against brokers, Eliot L. Spitzer has suggested moving New York more in line with the rest of the country.</p>
        <p>''It's a fair question why these restrictions exist on ticket sales in New York,'' Mr. Spitzer said yesterday. ''We should think about changing the statute and moving toward a freer market in tickets.'' That's not much help this week, but it does leave both teams' fans with that old refrain from the Brooklyn Dodgers: wait'll next year.</p>
