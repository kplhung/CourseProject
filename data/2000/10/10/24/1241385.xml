        <p>Though it's not polite to say so out loud, some of the best Spanish music was written by French composers, especially Debussy and Ravel, who were completely enamored of everything Spanish.</p>
        <p>But the cultural admiration went both ways across the border in the early 20th century. On Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall the conductor Charles Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra played music by Joaquin Turina, Joaquin Rodrigo and Manuel de Falla, all Spanish composers who spent formative years in Paris. The Swiss-born, Paris-trained Mr. Dutoit, the orchestra's esteemed music director since 1977, showed a natural affinity for the music on this second of two weekend Carnegie concerts, which also featured its 125-voice chorus (Iwan Edwards, director).</p>

        <p>Though it's not polite to say so out loud, some of the best Spanish music was written by French composers, especially Debussy and Ravel, who were completely enamored of everything Spanish.</p>
        <p>But the cultural admiration went both ways across the border in the early 20th century. On Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall the conductor Charles Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra played music by Joaquin Turina, Joaquin Rodrigo and Manuel de Falla, all Spanish composers who spent formative years in Paris. The Swiss-born, Paris-trained Mr. Dutoit, the orchestra's esteemed music director since 1977, showed a natural affinity for the music on this second of two weekend Carnegie concerts, which also featured its 125-voice chorus (Iwan Edwards, director).</p>
        <p>The big item on Sunday was a concert performance of de Falla's infrequently heard 1905 opera ''La Vida Breve'' (''The Short Life''). The story of this 70-minute work is simple and utterly bleak. Salud, a beautiful, fatalistic young woman from a Gypsy village in Granada, has been wooed by Paco, a handsome, rich young man. She loves him abjectly. Without warning, he marries a woman of his own class. Salud shows up at the wedding party, works herself into spasms of anger and pain, and dies on the spot.</p>
        <p>Trying to turn these downtrodden peasants into looming tragic figures, de Falla composed a brooding, weighty score, with clear touches of Wagner, Puccini and Debussy. But the weightiness is on the surface; the musical content remains rather thin. As in Wagner, the thick-textured orchestra dominates, slowly churning away under the vocal lines, which are delivered mostly in melodramatic arioso with occasional lyrical flights: echoes of sultry Spanish folk songs for Salud, and Italianate outpourings for Paco that make him seem out of place and not to be trusted. Climactic moments are underlined with heightened intensity and lush blasts from the orchestra but no essential change from the music's languid pace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dutoit, clearly taken with the score, led a sumptuously colored performance. Though the Spanish singers in the two leading roles brought stylistic authenticity to their portrayals, both had vocal weaknesses. As Salud, the soprano Maria Jose Montiel filled the hall with dusky but sometimes edgy sound; as Paco, the tenor Manuel Cid lacked vocal presence.</p>
        <p>The choral singing was splendid. The orchestra also sounded great in Turina's somewhat film-scorish but lively short symphonic poem ''La Procesion del Rocio,'' and in Rodrigo's slight but rather charming ''Concierto Andaluz'' (1967), a concerto for four guitars, performed winningly by the guitar quartet los Romeros, which has had three generations of guitar-playing Romero men in its ranks.</p>
        <p>On Saturday night the surprise was Mr. Dutoit's vibrant account of Carl Orff's popular 1937 secular cantata, ''Carmina Burana.'' It's easy to make fun of Orff's setting of these medieval poems celebrating earthly pleasures. In many performances all the primal shouting, faux-folk tunes, pile-driver rhythms and textural simplicity (60 minutes of music almost devoid of counterpoint) can sound rather silly and sometimes fascistic. But Mr. Dutoit brought restraint, sweetness and clarity to the work.</p>
        <p>The opening chorus, for example, was hushed, articulate, a bit slower than the norm, which made it seem more subtle and suspenseful. There was simple joy, not the typical excess, in the carousing choruses. And the soloists were strong: the soprano Nancy Allen Lundy, the baritone Mark Oswald and, in a humorous turn as the roasted swan about to become someone's dinner, the tenor Stanford Olsen. The chorus, again excellent, was supplemented by the admirable Brooklyn Youth Chorus (Dianne Berkun, director).</p>
        <p>The concert also offered Ravel's great Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, with the excellent pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet, who brought steely power to the music's primordial rumblings and shimmering delicacy to the passages of wistful musing. ''Fireworks,'' Stravinsky's four-minute 1908 warm-up to ''The Firebird,'' began the program, and the cool brilliance of the playing was typical of Mr. Dutoit's work with this commendable orchestra.</p>
