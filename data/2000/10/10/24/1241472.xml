        <p>In a second day of sprinting around his newly adopted home state, President Clinton stumped for his wife's United States Senate bid yesterday, while also broadening his efforts to bolster Vice President Al Gore's standing in an election that the president suggested would in part determine how lasting his legacy would be.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who started his day in the Hudson River Valley before flying to New York City and then taking a motorcade last night to New Rochelle, avoided direct attacks on Mr. Gore's opponent, Gov.

        <p>In a second day of sprinting around his newly adopted home state, President Clinton stumped for his wife's United States Senate bid yesterday, while also broadening his efforts to bolster Vice President Al Gore's standing in an election that the president suggested would in part determine how lasting his legacy would be.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who started his day in the Hudson River Valley before flying to New York City and then taking a motorcade last night to New Rochelle, avoided direct attacks on Mr. Gore's opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, or Representative Rick A. Lazio, Hillary Rodham Clinton's Republican rival.</p>
        <p>But he repeatedly spoke of how New Yorkers and the American public at large should be wary of assuming that years of prosperity and other kinds of progress would automatically continue.</p>
        <p>''We have before us the chance to build the future of our dreams,'' the president said. ''This election ought to be a feast. People shouldn't feel bad about the fact that nothing bad is happening. They should feel good. But they should understand that sometimes it is harder to make a good decision when times are good than when they are bad.''</p>
        <p>In campaigning for his wife yesterday, Mr. Clinton chose two places -- Kingston and Westchester County -- where Mr. Lazio is expected to do fairly well. Mrs. Clinton joined the president for the second and third stop, a fund-raiser at a Queens electrical workers' union hall that drew 800 and made about $75,000 for her campaign, and the Westchester event, which benefited the county Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>During his Kingston stop, Mr. Clinton called the first lady someone whose concern for the well-being of families and their children had been the ''driving obsession of her whole life,'' not just something that ''sort of occurred to her when she started to come up and see you.'' He also described his wife's involvement in White House policy and legislative initiatives over the last eight years, citing matters from children's health care to family medical leave.</p>
        <p>''She has perhaps been the most active first lady in history,'' Mr. Clinton said, wearing a small ''Hillary'' button on his lapel. She ''certainly has had the broadest range of interest since Eleanor Roosevelt.''</p>
        <p>The president's visit to Kingston had been inspired by a fund-raising luncheon to aid Representative Maurice D. Hinchey. But Mr. Clinton's praise of his wife was at times so effuse he almost seemed to run out of superlatives, noting at one point that he had ''never known anybody with the combination of brains, compassion and heart and the ability to get things done as she does.''</p>
        <p>The president hinted at a skepticism about the ability of Mr. Bush to make good decisions. Being president ''requires a certain level of experience, a certain level of judgment, a certain instinct,'' Mr. Clinton said, referring to Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>He generously praised Mr. Gore, but repeatedly warned that a Republican administration would roll back many of his initiatives. ''Do you want to build on the progress of the last eight years or not?'' he asked. ''If you do, we better stay with the crime program, the education program, the health care program, that have worked, that are moving this country in the right direction.''</p>
        <p>And as he arrived in Queens for a joint appearance with his wife, he had the motorcade pull over at Jackson Hole, a old-fashioned diner just outside La Guardia Airport. Sharing a table with Elliot Diringer, his deputy press secretary, and Karen Tramontano, his deputy chief of staff, he ordered a cheeseburger and fries. Did he want the works? ''Yep, the whole deal.'' He then put a quarter in the table-side jukebox and played Elvis's ''Don't Be Cruel.''</p>
