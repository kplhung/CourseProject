        <p>After only three days of bidding, an auction for licenses to operate a new generation of wireless devices in Italy ended in confusion today after a consortium backed by British Telecommunications backed out, leaving only five bidders for the five licenses.</p>
        <p>The government, which had hoped to raise as much as $20 billion from the auction, which began on Thursday, suspended the bidding. Prime Minister Giuliano Amato then met with cabinet ministers to decide whether to accept the result or nullify the auction and seek fresh bids.</p>
        <p>After a five-hour meeting, the government ruled the auction valid and said it would expel the consortium, called Blu, from the proceedings rather than accept its withdrawal. The government said in a statement that it would keep the consortium's deposit and might seek more in damages, accusing the phone company of failing to participate in good faith.</p>
        <p>The exit of Blu ended the bidding with the five licenses costing $2 billion to $2.1 billion each, or a total of about $10 billion.</p>
        <p>The bidders that were left were cellular phone alliances backed by the former national phone company, Telecom Italia; Vodafone AirTouch of Britain; Telfonica of Spain; Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong; and a consortium led by France Telecom and the Italian utility Enel.</p>
        <p>The immediate loser appeared to be British Telecom, which has been struggling to assemble a European network of licenses for the new technology. But the result also appeared to signal an end to the frenzied bidding of the past that pushed prices to astronomical levels, depressing the stocks of phone companies and prompting in some cases lower ratings of the companies' creditworthiness. Governments elsewhere in Europe have reaped windfalls from auctions of the licenses for the new generation of devices that use a technological standard called United Mobile Telecommunications Service, or U.M.T.S. Telephone companies hope it will enable them to offer high-speed data transmission that will provide consumers wireless access to the Internet.</p>
        <p>After the British government raised $34 billion and Germany received $42 billion, many analysts expected Italy to raise about $21 billion. But while 13 bidders entered the fray in Britain earlier this year, only 6 companies competed in Italy. Then Blu, which was backed by British Telecom investors around the Benetton textile family, quit today after the shareholders disagreed on how to share the cost.</p>
        <p>The dispute focused on demands that British Telecom raise its stake in Blu to more than 50 percent from 20 percent. In a statement, British Telecom said that ''regrettably, a meeting of the Blu shareholders has decided that the company should not continue in the auction process.'' The decision appears to have been forced by the Benettons, who control Autostrade S.p.A., a highway operating group and partner in Blu, and feared the burden of investment costs in a noncore business.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for British Telecom said ''future evaluation'' would determine the future of its share in Blu, though it had no immediate intention to sell. Investors did not punish British Telecom for the setback, and its shares rose by more than 3 percent.</p>
