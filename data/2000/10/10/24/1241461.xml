        <p>American troops and diplomats in parts of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the small Persian Gulf states of Bahrain and Qatar were placed on the highest state of alert today because of credible threats of a terrorist attack, a senior Clinton administration official said.</p>
        <p>While declining to identify the source of the threats, the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were aimed at certain diplomatic missions and military installations in the region, including air bases. The bases affected by the heightened measures were placed on ''delta'' alert, which means they must prepare for imminent attack.</p>
        <p>The official would not identify which specific bases and diplomatic compounds had been affected. The alert comes as senior defense officials said that embassies and military bases around the world have been placed on heightened alert as a result of the Oct. 17 attack on the destroyer Cole as it was refueling in the harbor at Aden, Yemen.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said they see enough similarities between the Cole attack in the port of Aden and the bombing of two American embassies in East Africa in 1998, which have been blamed on Al Qaeda, the group headed by the Saudi financier Osama bin Laden, to warrant taking this precaution against a second or third attack. Multiple attacks have been a hallmark of the  group.</p>
        <p>''What you see now is a flood of reporting from all corners of the world on terrorist threats,'' said a senior defense official, who cautioned that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is still far from determining which group is responsible for the attack on the Navy ship that killed 17 sailors.</p>
        <p>While there is no specific evidence of a follow-up attack, American counterterrorist experts are sifting through the mounting reports of potential threats that have been reported by American officials around the globe since the Cole was bombed, particularly those from the Middle East and the Persian Gulf region.</p>
        <p>Since the Cole was attacked by a small boat carrying explosives, military missions and embassies have been told to step up security.</p>
        <p>Richard Clarke, the counterterrorism coordinator on the National Security Council, said on Sunday that there are ''similarities in the sophistication of the attack, the preplanning of the attack'' on the Cole and the bombings of the American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, that killed 301 people.</p>
