        <p>The Yankees had the Mets on the ropes. They were fighting for a Subway Series sweep. It was easy to imagine that every baseball fan within 100 miles of New York City was looking forward to this evening's game, but there were some who were looking instead into the shadows of the past.</p>
        <p>Nat Rizzuto sat at his kitchen table, drinking instant coffee amid yellowing stacks of The Daily News. With his lips pursed tight, he swallowed, then slowly shook his head -- as if the simple gesture might retrieve the years gone by.</p>
        <p>''Baseball has changed so much in the neighborhood since we were kids,'' Mr. Rizzuto said, directing his voice at an autographed baseball that lay beside his coffee mug. ''The kids don't play anymore. They got the TV set and their video games. We didn't have none of that when we were young. Playing ball was all we had.''</p>
        <p>The baseball that was the focus of his little speech was addressed to Cousin Nat and bore the scrawled signature, ''Scooter Phil Rizzuto.'' An ailing but sprightly man of 83, Nat Rizzuto is the only relative of his famous cousin Scooter, the legendary Yankees shortstop still living in their native  Ridgewood, Queens.</p>
        <p>It was after World War II that Phil Rizzuto established his Hall of Fame credentials as a lightning-handed, ball-gobbling infielder on a series of triumphant Yankee teams, overlapping with Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra and Billy Martin. He went on to become the longtime broadcast voice of the team, known for his goofy anecdotes and signature exclamation, ''Holy Cow!'' Nat Rizzuto, too, was known to toss the ball around a bit, although he freely acknowledges that on the sandlot across the street -- just like the big one in the Bronx -- it was his cousin Phil who always stole the show.</p>
        <p>''I had my usual position, at left out,'' Mr. Rizzuto chuckled yesterday inside his tiny home on St. Felix Avenue. ''But Phil was so much better than any of us by far. He was a natural. We struggled, but he made everything look like a cinch.''</p>
        <p>Nat and Phil -- their fathers were brothers -- used to play ball every weekend and after school at Evergreen Park on St. Felix Avenue, or nearby at Victory Field on Woodhaven Boulevard, or in Jamaica, Queens, on a diamond run by the Y.M.C.A. It was a neighborhood, Mr. Rizzuto said, that from the first thaw to the first freeze was filled with boys swinging for the fences, careering around the bases and returning to Mom with their knees scuffed from sliding into home.</p>
        <p>These days, however, Mr. Rizzuto hardly sees any kids playing baseball as he drives through the neighborhood. Basketball and football are the games of choice. Victory Field is still there, he said, but it is ill-maintained. A few years back, he added, the city paved over the field at Evergreen Park.</p>
        <p>It's a part of his childhood that no longer exists.</p>
        <p>''What I remember,'' he said, ''was playing ball all morning, then listening on the radio to a professional game in the afternoon. Then maybe we'd all meet over at the candy store and go through the game.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rizzuto has heard the explanations trotted out by his less-enlightened neighbors and friends. Ridgewood is changing, getting poorer. The black and Hispanic families moving in don't have the money or the interest to get their kids out on the baseball diamond, glove in hand.</p>
        <p>He doesn't believe a word it.</p>
        <p>''As I see it, a lot of those Spanish kids want to play ball,'' he said. ''Kids are kids. All kids want to be athletes.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Rizzuto is still a Yankee fan, his world has changed immensely over 50 years -- he remembers when what is now his garage was the stable where the Ridgewood Wet Wash Company boarded its horse and carriage -- and the shift away from baseball is just part of that change.</p>
        <p>In the old days, he said, his cousin Phil, even after he became a Yankee, could go to the bowling alley and enjoy a couple of frames like any regular guy on a lark. But these days, he asked, could Derek Jeter go anywhere in public without causing a riot?</p>
        <p>''There just wasn't the same kind of ballyhoo back then like we have today,'' Mr. Rizzuto said. ''There wasn't television making players into celebrities.''</p>
        <p>''The ballplayers today aren't hungry anymore,'' he went on. ''The old Yankees -- now there was a bunch of hungry guys. I guess that's why we loved them. They were just like us.''</p>
