        <p>The Yankees lead the Subway Series 2-0. Any fan would know that this is because of a winning run in the bottom of the 12th in Game 1 and 95 mile per hour pitching in Game 2. The Mets have had their own highlights despite the defeats -- the five-run rally in Game 2's ninth inning, for instance.</p>
        <p>But across New York City and the region, as the games have unfolded, there has been a different, additional kind of scorekeeping going on. Latino fans, concerned, of course, about the essential rooting question of Mets against Yankees, have been almost as preoccupied with the performance of individual Latino players.</p>
        <p>They are using the scorecards they keep in their hearts.</p>
        <p>In Washington Heights, where most of the city's Dominicans live, there has been attention to Armando Benitez and Timo Perez of the Mets and Jose Vizcaino of the Yankees. In Flushing, Queens, in the Venezuelan households off Main Street, there has been acute interest in the fortunes of Edgardo Alfonzo of the Mets and Luis Sojo of the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Orlando Hernandez of the Yankees, ''El Duque,'' has his diehard following in Union City, New Jersey's Cuban-American enclave. Puerto Ricans have had Bernie Williams and Jorge Posada, and Panamanians have had Mariano Rivera.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, things can get complicated, loyalties can become conflicted, priorities uncertain.</p>
        <p>In the home of Oscar and Isabel Molino in Flushing, friends have been gathering to watch the games and sort through divided allegiances. There is a prominent Venezuelan on each team, Sojo on the Yankees and Alfonzo on the Mets, so they have had to adopt a special formula: one team, two Venezuelans.</p>
        <p>''The Mets should win,'' Mrs. Molino, 64, said, ''but I want Sojo to do a good job.''</p>
        <p>Such torn sentiments have become familiar in recent years as more Latino players joined Major League Baseball rosters, and as the city and region have similarly become more infused with Latinos.</p>
        <p>Latinos now account for 25 percent of major league players. That figure is nearly double what it was in 1990 and reflects the greatest Latino participation of any professional sport in the country, including soccer, according to Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society. And most of them are foreign-born.</p>
        <p>Sports experts say major league recruitment of players in Latin America over the last two decades is a business decision prompted by the lower cost of recruiting outside the United States as well as by the difficulty of competing for young athletes increasingly drawn to football and basketball.</p>
        <p>Many Latino fans say there is a lot riding on a good showing by Latino players: their image as a minority ethnic group, worthy role models for Latino children, increased opportunities for other Latinos in baseball.</p>
        <p>''Any time that some Latino does something positive in any field, more doors open,'' said Luis Morandi, 49, a Mets fan and Venezuelan who has lived in New York for 30 years.</p>
        <p>But Jose C. Masso, a sports study center scholar who is Puerto Rican, noted that the fervor had become more intense after Latino players' accomplishments brought them more national exposure. Sammy Sosa's home run chase with Mark McGwire in 1998 and the Most Valuable Player Awards won by Sosa, a Dominican, and Juan Gonzalez, a Puerto Rican, that year are but two examples.</p>
        <p>''What we pride ourselves in is that all these ballplayers are representing all Latinos well in the game in the United States and that they are changing the style and the face of the game,'' Mr. Masso said. ''That's what people go crazy about.''</p>
        <p>''If the Latino fans had their way, all these players would form a Latino team that would take on the World Series champions,'' he said. ''In their mind, that Latino team would win.''</p>
        <p>Wilkin Abreu, a 23-year-old barber, said he kept track of Sosa's home run chase against McGwire by writing the number of his latest home run on his car window in chalk with big, fat figures. Mr. Abreu, of the Bronx, is a fan of the Mets.</p>
        <p>But when Sosa and the Cubs face the Mets, Mr. Abreu is just Dominican, like his idol.</p>
        <p>''When Sammy plays I want Chicago to win because when his team wins it raises his stature,'' Mr. Abreu said. ''You say you're Dominican and people mention Sammy Sosa. They know what the Dominican Republic is.''</p>
        <p>Rodolfo Colon, 42, a Puerto Rican community organizer from the Bronx, said he had been a Yankees fan ''since I heard Mickey Mantle's name.'' But it was Roberto Clemente, the Puerto Rican with the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 50's, 60's and 70's, who meant the most to him.</p>
        <p>''He was the first one who lifted my spirit,'' Mr. Colon said. ''He was the leader of any stardom, the one who showed what a Hispanic can do in baseball.''</p>
        <p>So in this World Series, ''I'm rooting for the Yankees but I want my kids to excel,'' he said of the Latino players.</p>
        <p>The cheering among Latino fans can be intensely personal. When the Yankees won the World Series in 1998, New York City threw the team a parade. Four days later, Hernandez, one of the Yankees' starting pitchers, got his own parade in Union City.</p>
        <p>There, baseball fans celebrated not only athletic achievement but also the success of a compatriot who had fled Fidel Castro's Cuba, leaving country and family behind to pursue freedom, as they had.</p>
        <p>Hermenegildo Fernandez, 64, an exile who said his brother lost a cigar factory to Cuba's revolutionary government in the 60's, said he was a Yankees fan as long as Hernandez was pitching. If he went to the Mets, Mr. Fernandez said, he would follow him to the Mets.</p>
        <p>''The man escaped and here we have him, and we have to support him,'' he said while seated inside Mi Bandera Restaurant in Union City, where El Duque himself eats sometimes.</p>
        <p>All the individual rooting can make for uncomfortable moments. Witness the Yankee fans who go to games and go wild over a home run by someone from the opposing team -- say, Manny Ramirez of Washington Heights who plays for the Cleveland Indians, or Alex Rodriguez, a Seattle Mariners star.</p>
        <p>''I don't like it when Cleveland comes to town and they root for Manny Ramirez,'' said James McDonough, 27, a firefighter from the Bronx who was having a drink at Vega Alta Bar in the Bronx near Yankee Stadium one day last week before going to Game 6 against the Mariners. ''It's not right. You're not being a real Yankee fan.''</p>
        <p>His friend, Rich McGee, 29, a teacher, said he did not understand it, either. ''I don't root for Jeff Kent because he's Irish,'' he said, referring to the second baseman for the San Franciso Giants.</p>
        <p>Some Latino fans are equally taken aback. Luis Guerrero, 29, a fifth-grade public school teacher and Dominican-American who moved to the United States when he was 9, said player-crazy fans ''are really not into the baseball.''</p>
        <p>''They can't really talk about the other teams or know what's happening in baseball,'' said Mr. Guerrero, whose favorite player is the Yankee right fielder, Paul O'Neill. ''They'd pick Pedro Martinez even if he's not the best. That's not being a real fan, just rooting for a particular person.''</p>
        <p>But the Latino allegiances make sense to Dennis Terry, 55, a management consultant who as a black American remembered being a young boy in North Carolina where ''everybody was a Dodger fan because Roy Campanella and Jackie Robinson were on that team.''</p>
        <p>''Not that we didn't know about Mickey Mantle,'' he said. ''But we were rooting for the Dodgers, or the Giants where Willie Mays was. There was certainly the ethnic pride when you see folks come up for the first time.''</p>
        <p>The difference, he said, is that Latinos have both ethnic and national allegiances. ''The pull of the home country is stronger with the first two generations,'' he said. ''What you do see is young kids wearing Yankee uniforms.''</p>
        <p>After two games in this World Series, many fans are ecstatic over Vizcaino, who got four hits for the Yankees in Game 1, including the game-winner, but have fretted over Timo Perez, the rookie Mets sensation who committed a major base-running blunder in Game 1.</p>
        <p>But even when the players lapse, the fans forgive.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't have much major league experience,'' Edward Castillo, 24, a busboy at a Midtown restaurant who moved to New York from the Dominican Republic six years ago, said of Perez. ''He's learning. Rickey Henderson, with 21 years in the major leagues, has done the same thing this season. I don't think Timo will do it again.''</p>
        <p>Omar Minaya, senior assistant general manager with the Mets and the highest-ranking Latino in team management these days, said he hoped he wouldn't see many Mets fans rooting for Bernie Williams, the Yankee center fielder, to get a hit off Al Leiter, a Mets pitcher.</p>
        <p>''This is about the Bronx against Queens,'' he said.</p>
