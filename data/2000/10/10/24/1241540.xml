        <p>Cabaret Convention Tribute  Town Hall</p>
        <p>The greatest song about fireflies ever written is almost certainly ''Glow-Worm,'' Johnny Mercer's playful 1952 setting of a 1902 melody by Paul Lincke. As Mercer's lyric compares a flashing insect to a car (''Glow, little glow-worm, turn the key on/You are equipped with taillight neon''), the song becomes a funny, sexy, fabulously inventive celebration of the mating instinct. And when the songwriter Carol Hall performed it last Tuesday evening as part of the Cabaret Convention's three-hour tribute to Mercer, she lingered over every delicious phrase. (''Thou aeronautical boll weevil/Illuminate yon woods primeval.'')</p>

        <p>Cabaret Convention Tribute  Town Hall</p>
        <p>The greatest song about fireflies ever written is almost certainly ''Glow-Worm,'' Johnny Mercer's playful 1952 setting of a 1902 melody by Paul Lincke. As Mercer's lyric compares a flashing insect to a car (''Glow, little glow-worm, turn the key on/You are equipped with taillight neon''), the song becomes a funny, sexy, fabulously inventive celebration of the mating instinct. And when the songwriter Carol Hall performed it last Tuesday evening as part of the Cabaret Convention's three-hour tribute to Mercer, she lingered over every delicious phrase. (''Thou aeronautical boll weevil/Illuminate yon woods primeval.'')</p>
        <p>Ms. Hall was the latest recipient of the Johnny Mercer Songwriter Award, bestowed by the Mercer Foundation, which is run by his friend and champion, the singer Margaret Whiting, who introduced Ms. Hall. Previous recipients were onstage, and each sang a different Mercer standard. My favorite was the jazzy, slangy ''Something's Gotta Give'' (zestily sung by Michele Brourman), in which ''an irresistible force such as you meets an old immovable object like me.'' It's one of the few standards for which Mercer wrote both words and music.</p>
        <p>The tribute was the centerpiece of the 11th Annual Cabaret Convention, produced by the Mabel Mercer Foundation. (The two Mercers were not related.)</p>
        <p>If much of the stage talk was numbingly hyperbolic, the tribute succeeded in drawing an artistic portrait of Mercer, who died in 1976, as a wistful comic dreamer and dexterous wit with Southern roots whose lyrics reveled in nature's fecundity. But beneath the humor lurked a strain of pure folk poetry that the pop-jazz singer Mark Coffin uncovered in his quietly lucid rendition of ''Skylark,'' Mercer's 1941 collaboration with Hoagy Carmichael.</p>
