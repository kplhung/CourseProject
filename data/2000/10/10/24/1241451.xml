        <p>Twenty-one years after Latanisha Carmichael, a 3-year-old, was beaten to death, her tiny remains entombed in a bedroom closet, a State Supreme  Court justice in Brooklyn convicted the child's mother of second-degree murder and the little girl's brother of criminally negligent homicide yesterday.</p>
        <p>The mother, Madeline Carmichael, 61, was also found guilty of tampering with evidence and could face 25 years to life in prison when she is sentenced on Nov. 1 by Justice Anne G. Feldman, who issued the verdict.</p>
        <p>The child's brother, Gregory Carmichael, 38, was also found guilty of tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution. He could face from 3 to 11 years in prison, said Ama Dwimoh, one of the prosecutors in the case. Both defendants had been charged with second-degree murder.</p>
        <p>Madeline and Gregory Carmichael were arrested in November after Latanisha's surviving twin brother  investigated the story of her death and alerted the police. He learned the macabre details from his older sister, Sabrina Yaw, who was 8 years old at the time of the murder and the only eyewitness. For two decades she had kept the details to herself out of fear for her life, she testified.</p>
        <p>Last year, when the authorities searched the Carmichaels' apartment in Brownsville, Brooklyn, they found Latanisha's remains swaddled in a blanket and yellowing newspaper from Nov. 4, 1979, surrounded by air fresheners and hidden in a cedar-lined footlocker.</p>
        <p>Throughout the 10-day trial, the Carmichaels' lawyers argued that there was no conclusive medical evidence that the child had been fatally beaten, and that Latanisha's death was an accident.</p>
        <p>Jeff Adler, Gregory Carmichael's lawyer, said both defendants waived their right to a jury trial ''to take some of the emotion out of the case.'' Justice Feldman heard the trial instead of a jury.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adler said he was pleased that the justice found his client less responsible in the death than his mother. But Joshua Horowitz, Mrs. Carmichael's lawyer, was less satisfied with the verdict. ''I have a problem with the testimony of someone who was 8,'' Mr. Horowitz said, referring to Ms. Yaw. ''Then you add a 20-year lapse. Does that really provide an accurate enough basis for a conviction of this magnitude?''</p>
        <p>The Carmichaels' lawyers said they planned to appeal the verdicts.</p>
        <p>But the prosecutors said they thought the verdicts provided a just close to a sad story. The case was prosecuted by Barry Schreiber, deputy district attorney in charge of homicides; Frank Urzi, a senior trial lawyer in the Brooklyn district attorney's Crimes Against Children Bureau; and Ms. Dwimoh, who is the executive assistant district attorney in the bureau.</p>
        <p>Testifying on the first day of the trial, Ms. Yaw said she remembered  watching her mother and older brother beat the baby to death and  place the body in a trunk in a closet, and keeping the corpse a family secret for 20 years.</p>
        <p>She broke her silence when Andre Carmichael, Latanisha's twin, approached her with vague suspicions that he had had a sister who had disappeared years earlier, when he was too young to remember her. After brushing him off three times, Ms. Yaw said, she forced her brother to sign a contract swearing that he would never reveal what she was about to say. But once he heard the story, Andre Carmichael went to the police.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Yaw described her childhood home as a place of constant abuse, she said she also enjoyed pleasant times with her mother, after whom she named her first child.</p>
        <p>Mr. Horowitz seized on the complexities of their relationship to paint a picture of Mrs. Carmichael as a loving caretaker who accidentally killed her child. ''This was a woman who wanted to keep her family together,'' he said yesterday after hearing the verdict. ''She had a great fear of losing her family to well-meaning social services. I don't know if anyone would have an understanding of that rationale in not wanting to report an accident.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Dwimoh turned her attention to the victim.</p>
        <p>''Justice delayed was not justice denied for Latanisha Carmichael,'' Ms. Dwimoh said. ''But with any verdict, it's always bittersweet only because it brings into question why we're there. In this case, a little 3-year-old was murdered.''</p>
