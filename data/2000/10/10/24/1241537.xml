        <p>ALBANY: STATE LABOR CHIEF LEAVES  Gov. George E. Pataki forced out his labor commissioner, James J. McGowan, on Friday, state officials said yesterday. Mr. McGowan had become frustrated with the governor's actions to limit his authority, the officials said. For example, Mr. McGowan sought to fire James Dillon, his executive deputy commissioner, last week after concluding that Mr. Dillon was working with the governor's office to undermine Mr. McGowan. Instead, Governor Pataki appointed Mr. Dillon as interim labor commissioner. Mr. McGowan's wife said yesterday he could not return a phone call.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: BOND ACT CRITICIZED  A Brooklyn City Councilman yesterday criticized the state's proposed $3.8 billion Transportation Bond Act, on the ballot in November, as unfair to Brooklyn residents. The councilman, Kenneth K. Fisher, said the act would benefit the suburbs but offer little to Brooklyn, and he cited Brooklyn-Manhattan subway commuting times that are more than twice those of commuter train rides from the suburbs. Almost 40 percent of Brooklyn residents work in Manhattan, he said, and ridership from Brooklyn is expected to increase substantially.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: ANTI-TELEMARKETER LAW  Half a million or more state residents are expected to sign up for a ''Do Not Call'' list that telemarketing companies will be required to buy and follow. Gov. George E. Pataki signed a law on Oct. 12 that would fine telemarketers up to $2,000 per call for calling anyone on the list. The complete list will not be ready until April, said Jon Sorensen, a spokesman for the State Consumer Protection Board. Information is available at the Web site, www.consumer .state.ny.us/prereg.htm, or at (800) 697-1220.</p>

        <p>TEACHERS ARRESTED  Two public school teachers were arrested yesterday, one on an assault charge and another on a drug charge, the police said. At the George Washington High School Campus in Fort George, Manhattan, Walter Murray, 48, of Brooklyn, was charged with punching a 17-year-old male student, the police said. The student suffered a minor head injury. In the second case, a Spanish teacher at Acorn High School for Social Justice in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, was charged with possession of cocaine after a police investigation, the police said. They said they arrested the teacher, Daniel Cruz, 49, of Brooklyn, and recovered a plastic bag containing white powder.</p>

        <p>HEMPSTEAD: TWO KILLED IN ACCIDENT  A man and a young girl were killed and two other girls were injured last night by a driver with a suspended license, the Nassau County police said. The driver, Ronald Spearman, 58, was heading west on Front Street at 6:55 p.m. in a Ford van when the four pedestrians stepped out into the street and he drove into them, Detective Gary Ferrucci said in a statement. Santas Peneda, 25, of Inwood, and Gissel Moreno, 4, of Hempstead, were killed, Detective Ferrucci said. One of the other girls, Tonya Moreno, 7, of Hempstead, was in critical condition, and the other, Katharine Intenando, 4, of Hempstead, was in stable condition, Detective Ferrucci said. Mr. Spearman, of Brownsville in Brooklyn, was issued a summons for driving with a suspended license, Detective Ferrucci said. Andy Newman (NYT)</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: GUARDS IN COURT  The State Supreme Court ruled yesterday that a police officer standing behind a defendant does not necessarily prejudice jurors against the accused. The ruling, which upheld an appellate decision, stems from a 1995 trial of five men charged with murdering four members of a rival faction of a Chinese immigrant smuggling ring in Teaneck in 1993. A dozen sheriff's officers were in the courtroom every day, including officers behind each defendant. Nonetheless, Justice Peter G. Verniero wrote in the unanimous decision, the action did not substantially erode the presumption of innocence.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: HOSPITAL BILL APPROVED  To prevent for-profit health care companies from benefiting from tax breaks for nonprofit hospitals, New Jersey legislators approved a measure yesterday requiring the purchase of nonprofits to be reviewed by the state attorney general and a judge. No nonprofit hospital in the state has been acquired by a health care company, but such sales are expected. The State Senate approved the measure yesterday, 39 to 0, after Assembly approval Oct. 19. A spokeswoman for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said the governor would sign it. A spokesman for the New Jersey Hospitals Association said requiring a judge to clear a sale is unnecessary.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>HARTFORD: SURVEY CRITICIZES H.M.O.'S  A new survey suggests Connecticut doctors believe managed care hurts patients. Eighty-three percent of responding doctors said health maintenance organizations have hurt patient care, and 26 percent said they knew of a patient who died after an H.M.O. refused to authorize treatment that a doctor recommended. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, whose office paid $55,000 for the University of Connecticut survey, called the survey ''a searing indictment of H.M.O.'s by Connecticut doctors.'' Keith Stover, a lobbyist for the Association of Connecticut H.M.O.'s, said, ''In as much as a survey can be designed to generate a particular result, this one did it.''</p>
