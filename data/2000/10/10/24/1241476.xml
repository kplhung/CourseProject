        <p>At a time when Vice President Al Gore should be scrapping for votes in large swing states like Ohio and Michigan, he is devoting virtually his entire week to campaigning in smaller states that he should be able to ignore -- even his home state, Tennessee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's schedule, only two weeks before the Nov. 7 election, is the ultimate reflection of the down-to-the-wire campaign and the way factors as disparate as Mr. Gore's personality and Ralph Nader's candidacy are playing havoc with the electoral map.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, the Democratic nominee, will have campaigned in 11 states by the end of a week that began on Sunday afternoon in New Mexico and winds up on Friday in Pennsylvania. All 11 were won by President Clinton and Mr. Gore in  1992 and 1996, with the Democrats winning most by comfortable margins, often by double digits.</p>
        <p>The itinerary, which mirrors his advertising strategy, takes him to five states -- including Oregon and Washington today -- that were won not only by Mr. Clinton but also by Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in 1988. Mr. Dukakis carried only 10 states that year.</p>
        <p>The campaign swing includes  West Virginia, which has voted Republican only twice since 1960. And Mr. Gore will spend part of both Tuesday and Wednesday campaigning in Tennessee, where he has not  lost a race in a political career that dates to 1976. His Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, also plans to campaign in Tennessee on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The vice president's struggle to solidify his geographic base stems from several factors, political analysts said. Some are national, like his inability to reassure voters about his credibility and amiability, and the lingering tendency of some voters to associate Mr. Gore with a scandal-ridden White House. Others are more localized, including demographic changes in some states and the strength of Mr. Nader, the Green Party candidate, in places like the Pacific Northwest and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>In times of peace and prosperity, said Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, ''one would have expected more of what we saw after Labor Day, when he opened up leads in these states.''</p>
        <p>''Even though they weren't huge leads,'' Mr. Mann said, ''they seemed substantial enough to allow him to turn his attention and resources elsewhere.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore does seem to enjoy substantial leads in California and New York, and his postconvention travel to those states has largely been limited to fund-raising and television tapings. He has also forced Mr. Bush to compete in Florida, where Mr. Bush's brother is governor.</p>
        <p>But while campaigning in closely contested Oregon and Washington in the last two days, Mr. Gore has been forced to reach out to the disaffected Democrats who form the core of Mr. Nader's base. At rallies in Portland, Ore., on Sunday night and here today, he devoted more time than usual to promoting his environmental record, a critical issue for the Green Party.</p>
        <p>''I will fight to protect the environment with all my heart and soul,'' Mr. Gore told supporters here in an open airport hangar. In Portland last night, Mr. Gore vowed to ''protect ancient forests'' and to ''block new roads and timber sales in our roadless forests and ancient forest areas.''</p>
        <p>Part of his strategy to reclaim Nader supporters rests on raising fears about a Bush presidency.</p>
        <p>''My opponent in his state of Texas put a lobbyist for the chemical companies in charge of enforcing the environmental laws there,'' Mr. Gore said today. ''On his watch, Texas has sunk down to 50th out of all 50 in industrial pollution, the worst state for industrial pollution, with the smoggiest city, Houston, and over all the smoggiest state.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was even more explicit  when reporters aboard Air Force Two asked him about Mr. Nader.</p>
        <p>''I will stack my environmental record against anyone, including him,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore added that it was not his task to convince Americans that a vote for Mr. Nader was a vote for Mr. Bush. ''That may be true,'' he said, ''but my task is to convince them to vote enthusiastically for me and for what I represent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's allies in the Northwest say it is vital to win back perhaps half of Mr. Nader's supporters.</p>
        <p>''The Nader factor is huge in Oregon,'' said Representative Darlene Hooley, Democrat of Oregon. ''It's at 8 percent and has stayed at 8 percent, and that's why the vice president's spending time here.''</p>
        <p>Representative Jim McDermott, a Democrat who represents a Seattle district, said Mr. Gore would probably not have to campaign in Washington at this point were it not for Mr. Nader. ''Gore has to get his base out in states like this,'' Mr. McDermott said, ''and when you add in factors like Nader it throws in a few points.''</p>
        <p>But other Democratic leaders said Mr. Gore was still not receiving credit for the prosperity enjoyed during the Clinton administration, and they attributed his troubles to personality and style.</p>
        <p>Speaking at Sunday's rally in Portland, that city's Democratic congressman, David Wu, acknowledged that ''if I was choosing someone to have a cold beer with or go fishing with, the other fellow might be O.K.''</p>
        <p>In an interview today, Mr. Wu said that ''sometimes the vice president's delivery has gotten in the way of his message.''</p>
        <p>''The vice president, in a small group, one on one, is incredibly funny, he's charming, he's knowledgeable,'' Mr. Wu said. ''We need to free Al Gore, let Al Gore be Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was certainly in full voice today, feeling energized, aides said, by positive signs in several recent polls. He pledged to continue to speak in detail about issues until the final hours of the campaign.</p>
        <p>''Fifteen days is a long time if your objective is to hold the ball and run out the clock,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Fifteen days is a long time if you are trying to hide behind tracking polls and not engage in the issues because the people disagree with you on the issues. That's the dilemma that my opponent faces in the next 15 days.''</p>
        <p>Part of Mr. Gore's plan is to hold camera-friendly ''kitchen table'' discussions with citizens who can help him promote his policy proposals. He began today, sitting down for tea in Portland with Heather Howitt, 32, the  founder of Oregon Chai, a manufacturer of herbal tea.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gore asked Ms. Howitt to discuss the impact of the economy on her business, she responded on cue: ''The economy has been awesome the last eight years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore replied, ''You don't want to let that get away, right?''</p>
