        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I have spent a lifetime gaining and losing weight (''How the Body Knows When to Gain or Lose,'' Oct. 17).</p>
        <p>I have often lost up to 50 pounds at a time, only to gain it back. Drugs like Ritalin resulted in great loss of weight but had mood disorder consequences.</p>
        <p>I had a gastric stapling, which failed. I then had a gastric bypass. The latter resulted in a weight loss of 100 pounds, but I then slowly gained most of that back.</p>
        <p>The only method that has been successful is to walk on the treadmill an hour a day.</p>
        <p>This results in modest weight loss, and appears to affect metabolism to some extent. I find that as long as I continue the exercise religiously, my weight loss can be maintained.</p>
