        <p>Michael A. Ferguson was in Vicki's Diner on South Broad Street the other day, shaking hands and handing out campaign literature for his Republican Congressional race.</p>
        <p>But in the clutter of this election year, voters like Steve Jacobus, a contractor sitting in the smoking section at Vicki's, were saying that it is hard enough to decide whom they want to be President.</p>
        <p>''I've never heard of him,'' Mr. Jacobus said at last of Mr. Ferguson, a former teacher and once the head of a conservative Catholic issues advocacy group who has never held elective office. ''But if he's the Republican, I guess I'm voting for the other guy.''</p>
        <p>The ''other guy'' is Maryanne Connelly, a retired AT&amp;T executive and  former mayor of Fanwood, N.J.</p>
        <p>If there is any race that is a real tossup in the battle for control of the House of Representatives, experts say, it is this one, in New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District.</p>
        <p>The seventh is one of 34 open seats  nationally in an election where a shift of just eight seats could give the Democrats control of the House.</p>
        <p>Both parties are determined to emerge with a majority in the election on Nov. 7, and have sought to give a lift to their candidates in the race for the seat in the Seventh District, which is being vacated by Bob Franks, who is running for United States Senate.</p>
        <p>Representatives Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, and Patrick J. Kennedy of Massachusetts have campaigned for Ms. Connelly, and Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, stumped with her last week.</p>
        <p>The Republicans gave Mr. Ferguson a prominent speaking role at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, and Senator John McCain of Arizona taped a television commercial for him.</p>
        <p>''When you look around the country, I find a really small handful of races that are the truest of true tossups, and the New Jersey Seventh fits that category,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of The Rothenberg Report, a political newsletter published in Washington. ''And the tossups are the ones that are going to decide who controls the House.''</p>
        <p>But even with help from some of their party's big names, Mr. Ferguson, 30, and Ms. Connelly, 55, find themselves along the edges of a close national election and an attention-getting United States Senate race.</p>
        <p>The candidates have issues on which they differ -- abortion rights, school vouchers and how Social Security funds should be invested -- and Ms. Connelly complains that her opponent has disguised his conservative philosophy by moving to the center on issues such as gun control, environmental protection and expanded Medicare benefits, complicating her efforts to distinguish herself in the minds of voters.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Ferguson says: ''I have not moved a bit. I am a mainstream Republican in the mainstream of New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>The shape of the Seventh District resembles a big cat, crouching over  parts of Middlesex, Somerset, Union and Essex Counties. Fewer than half of the district's voters are registered in a political party, and although Democrats outnumber Republicans slightly in party affiliation, the district has a distinct Republican cast.</p>
        <p>So although a majority in the district voted for President Clinton and Senator Robert G. Torricelli in 1996, they heavily supported Republicans in local races that year and since.</p>
        <p>Ms. Connelly has lived in the Seventh District for decades, has served on the Borough of Fanwood council and for four terms as mayor, and then had a stint as police commissioner there. In 1988, Ms. Connelly came within 12,000 votes of upsetting Mr. Franks, then a three-term incumbent, a performance that she thought would earn her the party's support for another run this year.</p>
        <p>But when the Democratic organization instead chose Michael J. Lapolla, the Union County executive, as its candidate, she ran against him in the June primary, and won. When she repeats her unofficial campaign mantra, ''I just have to work harder,'' she is saying something that resonates with the women who form the core of her political support.</p>
        <p>In campaigning in the last several weeks and in interviews, Ms. Connelly has seemed frustrated by Mr. Ferguson's dogged centrism, and she may even have lost ground by her efforts to paint him as an extremist.</p>
        <p>''I think that he is trying to avoid speaking about the issues and coming up with clear answers,'' Ms. Connelly said in an interview. ''We're running for the United States Congress and I think it really is time to say you can make the tough decisions, and let people who are going into the voting booth know what's going on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferguson first ran for Congress in 1998 in the adjacent Sixth District, where he lost to Representative Frank E. Pallone by 23,000 votes. He did not move into the Seventh until late last year, when Mr. Franks announced his Senate bid. But he appeared to be able to put the carpetbagger label behind him when he won the primary in a crowded Republican field, beating, among others, Thomas H. Kean Jr., the son of the former governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferguson spent a year as an unpaid volunteer teacher and sports coach at Mount St. Michael High School, a parochial school in the Bronx, under a program designed by Notre Dame University, of which he is a graduate. He then spent two years in Washington as executive director of Catholic Campaign for America, a group his father, Tom, helped found in 1991 to encourage American Catholics to be more observant and to be advocates for what it calls ''culture of life'' issues, including opposition to abortion, euthanasia and fetal-tissue experimentation.</p>
        <p>After earning a master's degree in public policy at Georgetown, Mr. Ferguson founded an educational consulting firm and taught for two years at Brookdale Community College in Lincroft before leaving to campaign full-time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferguson rarely mentions his conservative views -- he said he favors school prayer and a Constitutional amendment banning abortion -- in favor of more centrist positions. When he is pressed to spell out the specifics of his approach, he emphasizes the importance of respecting all views and of working toward a common ground.</p>
        <p>''When you look at the issues,'' he said in a recent interview, he said his views ''are consistent with the mainstream of New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>Those views include support for some gun control measures, including a waiting period before purchases and mandatory trigger locks, positions that have become nearly automatic even for Republicans in New Jersey. His environmental platform stresses the popular topic of limiting sprawl and preserving open space, subjects not far from Ms. Connelly's own positions.</p>
        <p>The two candidates agree on expanding Medicare coverage for the aged, guaranteed rights to choose one's own doctor under managed care, and the right to sue health insurers.</p>
        <p>''We've seen Republicans all over the country saying, 'yes, the issues are prescription drugs and protecting Social Security and we're not going to let the Democrats take those issues away from us,' '' Mr. Rothenberg, the analyst, said. ''So Mike Ferguson has made it very hard for Maryanne. Yes he's against abortion, but on everything else he's tried to move to the center and make it difficult for her to draw contrasts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferguson has made education a centerpiece in his campaign, and he is a strong advocate of school vouchers. Like Ms. Connelly, Mr. Ferguson speaks of increasing ''accountability'' in public schools, and like her, he broadly favors tax breaks for college expenses, although he is not as specific as she is on how he would achieve them.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Ferguson says he favors lower taxes, but has not indicated by how much, saying such details have to be worked out in the future.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Ferguson's campaign advertising stresses his youthfulness, good looks , his two small children and his wife, Maureen.</p>
        <p>Ms. Connelly, who is a widow who never had children, said she thought her opponent was trying to draw a contrast with her personal life.</p>
        <p>''That's why I have to just work harder,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Connelly has worked hard to catch Mr. Ferguson off guard, as when his campaign mistook a $5,000 campaign contribution from the American Medical Association as an endorsement (the association does not endorse candidates, a statement said) and when he similarly claimed an endorsement from the American Hospital Association, which also donated money but did not endorse Mr. Ferguson. Ms. Connelly, for her part, has paid a price for attacking Mr. Ferguson, sometimes with little basis. Her campaign has accused him of being supported by the National Rifle Association, while in fact he has not taken money from the N.R.A. and has been endorsed by some of the same gun-control groups that she has.</p>
        <p>Ms. Connelly's campaign was particularly wounded when an unsigned commentary last month in The Star-Ledger, New Jersey's largest newspaper, took her to task for what it called unfounded attacks on Mr. Ferguson, and said she was a contender to being ''New Jersey's sleaziest candidate.'' In an editorial last Sunday, however, the Star-Ledger warmly endorsed Ms. Connelly and said the unsigned piece did not represent the paper's point of view.</p>
        <p>But the ''sleaziest'' charge has since become a centerpiece of Mr. Ferguson's literature, with some impact.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferguson recently campaigned at Panera, a coffee shop in Westfield, where he stopped at the table of Jenny Cline .</p>
        <p>Afterward, Ms. Cline said: ''I think the campaign's been too negative on Maryanne Connelly's part. It seems to me, the lower the level of the office, the lower the level of the campaigning.''</p>
