        <p>Friends of Nature  A treasure of the New-York Historical Society since 1858, Thomas Cole's five-part painting cycle ''The Course of Empire'' is the centerpiece of an exhibition that opens today and celebrates a historic friendship. Besides Cole, the friends were the artist Asher B. Durand and the poet and editor William Cullen Bryant. He shared their attachment to nature and helped promote the art of Cole and Durand, founders of the Hudson River School. The exhibition, ''Intimate Friends,'' through Feb. 4, consists of 47 oils, 25 sketches and related newspapers, manuscripts and books. The show complements ''Art and the Empire City: New York, 1825-61'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>Masters' Touch  One master of the guitar will pay tribute to another at 8 tonight at the Tisch Center for the Arts at the 92nd Street Y, where Christopher Parkening will open this season's ''Guitar'' series with a tribute to his mentor, Andres Segovia (1893-1987). After a short film on Segovia and Mr. Parkening's role in maintaining his legacy, the program will include some of Segovia's favorite pieces and some of Mr. Parkening's favorite Segovias, followed by a question-and-answer session.</p>
        <p>Image Makers  For a continuing photographic essay examining the influence of crack on urban neighborhoods, Brenda Ann Kenneally of Brooklyn has been named this year's recipient of the $20,000 W. Eugene Smith Grant in Humanistic Photography. The grant, presented by the W. Eugene Smith Memorial Fund and sponsored by Nikon, recognizes photographers who have demonstrated a commitment to documenting the human condition.</p>
