        <p>Like a hardy perennial that makes its annual appearance during the intense end-of-session negotiations between Congress and the White House over spending bills, education has once again emerged as a key and highly contentious issue.</p>
        <p>But times have changed from the days when Congressional Republicans demanded the abolition of the Department of Education and an end to a federal role in education.</p>
        <p>Now, Republican leaders brag about how much they will spend on it, even as they remain at loggerheads with the White House over who will control education aid and which school districts will get most of it.</p>
        <p>The new complexity of the negotiations almost makes some administration officials yearn for the good old days when all they had to do was save the education agency.</p>
        <p>''They wanted to eliminate the department,'' said Richard W. Riley, Secretary of Education. ''That was a clear fight. It's not so clear now.''</p>
        <p>This year disputes about President Clinton's desire to give $1.75 billion to local districts to hire teachers and reduce some class sizes and to provide $1 billion for after-school programs are holding up the measure. Congressional Republicans have countered with proposals to funnel $1.4 billion for new teachers and $600 million for after-school activities.</p>
        <p>Beyond the debate over money, the fight reflects differences in party ideology and over which districts get more money.</p>
        <p>Republicans argue that federal aid should be given to states through block grants that would be distributed to local districts generally based on the number of students. This way, Republicans say, local districts decide how to use the money.</p>
        <p>''Let's allow them, if they need new teachers, to do that,'' said Representative Bill Goodling, a Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. ''But if they need to retrain teachers they have, if they have some with potential and they want to improve their ability, use the money for that.''</p>
        <p>The debate reflects more than philosophical differences. Applying money to specific programs like hiring more teachers to reduce class size generally results in money going to poor school districts in inner cities that are usually represented in Congress by Democrats. Sending money to states via block grants generally means more for affluent suburban districts, which tend to be represented by Republicans.</p>
        <p>The education financing is mainly in a huge spending bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and other related agencies. The measure, which carries a price tag of about $106.7 billion and will doubtlessly rise, is the largest domestic spending bill that Congress will consider.</p>
        <p>How the issue is handled is enormously important to both sides. Polls consistently show that education, along with Social Security and health care, is a top voter concern. On Tuesday, President Clinton and Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois are to hold news conferences to lay out the educational programs they would like Congress to finance.</p>
        <p>Democrats believe that one reason it has been so difficult to reach an agreement on the bill is because of splits among Congressional Republicans.</p>
        <p>In the summer, the White House proposed adding $6.2 billion to the  bill, in part so Republicans could finance education programs they wanted through a block grant, while allowing sufficient money for Mr. Clinton's plan for more teachers. Republican leaders balked, however, and last week, the White House lowered its request to $4.9 billion.</p>
        <p>When some Republican negotiators tentatively agreed to a counteroffer of $3.2 billion, Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education,  said he would not approve any bill that exceeded $106.7 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Specter has since bowed out of the negotiations. And late this evening, Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaskan Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee, offered to raise spending by $3.5 billion, an offer the Democrats are now considering.</p>
