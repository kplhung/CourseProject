        <p>Caffeine, and not some other unsuspected component of coffee, appears to be responsible for what some researchers have identified as coffee drinkers' decreased risk of developing Parkinson's disease, a new study reports.</p>
        <p>Researchers from the Department of Veterans Affairs found this year that people who drank moderate amounts of coffee appeared substantially less likely to develop Parkinson's, a debilitating neurological disease.</p>
        <p>Scientists may still not understand what process is at work, but they say they suspect it is caffeine that should get the credit. Dr. Alberto Ascherio of the Harvard School of Public Health presented the findings at a recent conference of the American Neurological Association in Boston.</p>
        <p>Not only did the study confirm the main findings of an earlier report, it established  that other caffeinated beverages also appear beneficial. The researchers compared the effects of those beverages with the effects of decaffeinated coffee.</p>
        <p>The new study, unlike the first, looked at women as well as men, finding that they, too, had a reduced incidence of Parkinson's if they used caffeine. The researchers looked at data from more than 125,000 people.</p>
        <p>Moderate coffee drinking was defined as one to three cups a day. As consumption increases, the researchers found, the protective effect is lost.</p>
