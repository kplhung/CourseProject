        <p>This is a new 30-second commercial that the Lazio campaign plans to begin broadcasting.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- The Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- As the commercial opens, Rick A. Lazio is shaking hands with sports fans in Buffalo Bills jerseys. The male announcer declares that Mr. Lazio ''has listened to upstate.'' Mr. Lazio is shown at events and giving a speech. He walks down a shopping street in Skaneateles, near Syracuse, dressed casually in a denim shirt and dark jacket, speaking directly to the camera. The commercial ends with Mr. Lazio seated at a restaurant counter with other diners.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ANNOUNCER: ''Rick Lazio. He's listened to upstate and he's ready to fight for us.'' Mr. Lazio: ''I grew up in New York, the son of a shop owner. My background taught me what we need. I've planned, for upstate, to give billions in tax relief to create real jobs, right here.''</p>
        <p>Announcer: ''Rick Lazio. He shares our values.'' Mr. Lazio: ''My dad used to say, show me your friends and I'll tell you who you are. Well I've made a lot of friends in Long Island by getting the job done. Now I'd like to earn your friendship too, here in upstate, by getting the job done, for you.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Lazio has proposed a sweeping package of tax cuts, including an elimination of the estate tax and so-called marriage penalty, cuts in the capital gains tax on investments, and a plan to make Social Security tax payments deductible for couples who make less than $106,000 a year. The Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative group, estimated that these cuts would be worth $4.2 billion to New Yorkers. But almost none of the tax cuts have anything to do, directly, with job creation. Like many Republicans, Mr. Lazio argues that putting money into the hands of consumers and investors will ultimately create jobs.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- This ad is a clear effort to respond to the perception in upstate and Western New York -- fueled by Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign -- that Mr. Lazio does not understand the economic woes of communities north of Westchester County, and does not have a plan to help them. It also makes a subtle dig at Mrs. Clinton's ''listening tour,'' conducted at the beginning of her campaign when she wanted to learn about voters' concerns. Mrs. Clinton has put forth many proposals, ranging from job tax credits to technology training programs to utility deregulation (sort of), which she says will help an area she describes as economically beleaguered. Some economists are dubious about the effectiveness of so-called targeted tax cuts, like Mrs. Clinton's. Whether New Yorkers are persuaded by Mr. Lazio's reassurances, and his promotion of public-private partnerships, may depend on whether they believe in the theory that has been called ''trickle-down'' economics by its opponents.</p>
