        <p>For the first time since the Census Bureau began tracking the numbers, families in which both parents are working have become the majority even among the most traditional families: married couples with children.</p>
        <p>According to a new Census Bureau report, based on data from 1998, both spouses were employed at least part time in 51 percent of the married couples with children, compared with 33 percent in 1976.</p>
        <p>Even married or single mothers of very young children were likely to work at least part time: 59 percent of the women with babies younger than a year old were employed in 1998, compared with 31 percent in 1976.</p>
        <p>And the numbers are even higher for those with older children. Of the 31.3 million mothers ages 15 to 44 whose children were older than a year, 73 percent worked in 1998, and 52 percent worked full time.</p>
        <p>''I still meet people all the time who believe that the trend has turned, that more women are staying home with their kids, that there are going to be fewer dual-income families, but it's just not true,'' said Ellen Galinsky, president of the Families and Work Institute.</p>
        <p>''It's time to move beyond, 'Is it good, is it bad?' and get to 'How do we make it work?' ''</p>
        <p>She and others expect that the proportion of working mothers will continue to grow.</p>
        <p>''Women are in the workplace to stay, and there's no telling how high the numbers could go: it'll be as high as women want it to be,'' said Judith Lichtman, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families. ''Women are choosing to work outside the home, while continuing to be major caregivers in the home. It's a challenge, and some employers are beginning to wake up and smell the coffee. Some companies now sell gourmet meals for employees to take home and put on the table.''</p>
        <p>Amara Bachu of the Census Bureau is analyzing the newest data on women and work, and while her work is at an early stage, she said, there are no signs that the trend toward more working mothers has peaked.</p>
        <p>''I think the 2000 data will show continued growth, over all, except perhaps among some very-high-income women, who may be a little more likely to stay home with their children,'' said Ms. Bachu, who wrote the census report with Martin O'Connell.</p>
        <p>As might be expected, families in which both parents were employed had higher incomes than those in which only one worked. According to the report, 55 percent of the dual-employed couples had annual incomes of $50,000 and over, compared with 40 percent of the couples in which only the husband worked.</p>
        <p>Education played a significant role in determining which mothers held jobs. Among college-educated women, 68 percent of those who had had a baby within the last year were employed, compared with only 38 percent of those who had not graduated from high school.</p>
        <p>Marital status played a part, too: 50 percent of the separated, divorced and widowed women with infants were working full time, compared with 39 percent of those who were married, and 24 percent of those who had never married.</p>
        <p>Those who had never married, the report said, were most likely to be in need of job-training assistance and child-care services.</p>
        <p>In past years, women with infants were substantially more likely to be employed if they had only one child than if they had two or more. But that gap has almost closed.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the report found, 61 percent of mothers with one infant held jobs, compared with 57 percent of those with two or more children, one younger than a year old.</p>
        <p>While working motherhood is becoming more the norm, childlessness, too, is on the rise.</p>
        <p>Among women ages 40 to 44, 19 percent were childless, compared with only 10 percent in 1976 and 11 percent in 1984. The high rate of childlessness, while unprecedented in recent years, is similar to the rates among women a century ago.</p>
        <p>But there are signs the childlessness now is often not by choice.</p>
        <p>''We asked women aged 15 to 39 whether they planned to have children, and 90 percent of them said they would,'' Ms. Bachu said. ''But many of them never do.''</p>
        <p>What happens to make the reality so different from the expectations is unclear.</p>
        <p>''I wonder, maybe people are feeling like it's too hard to combine work and children,'' Ms. Galinsky said. ''Or are they delaying marriage so long that it just doesn't happen?''</p>
        <p>According to the report, American women's fertility has been relatively constant for the last 20 years, at about 2.0 births a woman. Natural replacement of the population requires about 2.1 births a woman, a rate exceeded only by Hispanic women, who averaged about 2.4 births each by the time they were 40 to 44 and their childbearing was mostly over. African-American and Asian-American women in that age range averaged 2.0 births, while white women averaged 1.8 births.</p>
        <p>Births out of wedlock accounted for about 31 percent of the babies born -- and 86 percent of the births to teenagers -- in the year prior to June 1998, the study found. Most of the unmarried mothers had not graduated from high school, and only 3 percent had a college degree.</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 4, 2000, Saturday  An article on Oct. 24 about a Census Bureau study of women of child-bearing age misstated the prevalence of married couples in which both spouses work. Such couples, with children, have become a majority of all married couples, not just of those with children.</p>
