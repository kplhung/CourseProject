        <p>Michael R. Bonsignore, the chief executive of Honeywell International, and John F. Welch Jr., General Electric's chief, sat side by side yesterday on the stage in an NBC studio in the G.E. building in Rockefeller Center. They both looked tired, but only Mr. Welch looked exhilarated.</p>
        <p>The occasion, of course, was the official announcement of the news that had splashed across front pages and Web sites nationwide: General Electric was buying Honeywell in a stock deal worth $45 billion.</p>
        <p>There was little surprise in who seemed the happier of the two. Both men wore open-collared shirts -- a choice that Mr. Welch, put off by the Honeywell penchant for suits, suggested. The setting itself was symbolic -- it had been the RCA building until G.E. bought that company in the mid-80's. Today, few remember the Radio Corporation of America. And most expect Honeywell, too, to be absorbed into the behemoth that is G.E. But how will the merger affect G.E.? When Honeywell is reduced to a brand name and G.E.'s succession plan has played out, will G.E. still be the ''house that Jack built,'' a profit juggernaut that has made investors rich?</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch insists that the merger will provide a double-digit addition to earnings in its first year. Analysts find that easy to accept. They note that both companies make aircraft engines, industrial controls, chemicals and other similar products -- but sell them to different customers.</p>
        <p>And the corporate cultures seem to fit. Honeywell was formed by a merger of Honeywell Inc. and Allied Signal, and Allied -- the larger partner in that deal -- had until this year been run by Lawrence A. Bossidy, a former protege of Mr. Welch's at G.E. Mr. Bossidy and Mr. Welch had sounded the same themes -- Six Sigma quality control; growing services instead of tangible products; Web-enabled sales, service and back-office operations; and a financial discipline that enabled the company to meet or exceed earnings estimates every quarter.</p>
        <p>''This is not going to be any wrenching cultural shift,'' said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at the Harvard Business School.</p>
        <p>Indeed, at the news conference, Mr. Welch slipped once and referred to Honeywell as Allied. ''We talk the same language,'' he said.</p>
        <p>G.E., though, seems to have a larger vocabulary. Its operating margins and cash flow have been among the best in its areas. ''With G.E. running it, Honeywell would need only a nominal increase in revenue over the next few years to raise its profitability 50 percent,'' said Nicholas Heymann of Prudential Securities.</p>
        <p>He said that G.E.'s industrial automation business was more than twice as profitable as Honeywell's yet sold lower-margin products. ''Lloyd Trotter can wring more blood out of a rock than Honeywell can wring out of a sponge,'' Mr. Heymann said, referring to the head of GE Industrial Systems.</p>
        <p>Still, there are aspects to the acquisition of Honeywell that could raise red flags. Mr. Welch has long said he wanted G.E. to derive more and more of its revenue from services -- yet he has bought a huge bricks-and-mortar company.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Welch had promised to name his successor this year and retire in April. Now he has agreed to stay until the end of 2001 -- something that could make his successor feel like he was treading water for an extra eight months.</p>
        <p>''People will be looking to Jack for every decision and discounting everything his successor says,'' remarked Richard A. Bettis, a professor at the University of North Carolina's Kenan-Flagler Business School.</p>
        <p>The potential for turmoil goes well below the top management ranks. Honeywell brings 120,000 people to the mix. Many will lose their jobs, but many others will not. And that could make G.E. people quite nervous about whether they will be supervising, reporting to -- or even be replaced by -- a Honeywell person.</p>
        <p>''The headhunters are poised to start dialing right now,'' said John O. Whitney, a management professor at Columbia Business School.</p>
        <p>Still, few G.E.-watchers predict any mass defection. ''They're a classical proving ground for athletes,'' said Theodore Jadick, a partner in the executive search firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles, ''but it will be as tough as ever to woo their people away.''</p>
        <p>And Morton Pierce, head of Dewey Ballantine's mergers-and-acquisitions law practice, said that as for any impatience on the part of Mr. Welch's successor: ''So he's the Prince of Wales for nine months longer. It shouldn't be a problem if everyone knows he's anointed king.''</p>
        <p>Nor do all analysts think that adding industrial operations is such a bad idea. G.E. derives nearly half its revenue from financial services. ''This gives them better balance in sources of earnings,'' said Martin Sankey, a Goldman, Sachs analyst.</p>
        <p>And Honeywell does have lucrative products. For example, it has a large business in fine chemicals, used in pharmaceuticals and electronics -- one that Mr. Welch, a chemical engineer himself, has wanted G.E. to build.</p>
        <p>But perhaps most important, adding Honeywell could actually speed up G.E.'s move to services. Service contracts are a fast-growing part of the aircraft engine business. And, Honeywell not only sells industrial controls, but offers Web-based systems that manufacturers use to improve productivity.</p>
        <p>''G.E. wants to build bridges between manufacturing and services, and Honeywell's products help do that,'' said James N. Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research.</p>
