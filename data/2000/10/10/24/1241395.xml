        <p>For more than a century, scientists have assumed that it was all but impossible to witness the evolution of a new species in nature, a process thought to be too long and drawn out to be captured in the lifetime of any human researcher.</p>
        <p>Now in the current issue of Science, researchers studying salmon present evidence -- that has startled biologists and is already being vigorously contested by some scientists -- suggesting that new species can evolve much more rapidly than biologists had previously thought.</p>
        <p>In addition to shaking up scientists' ideas of just how quickly new species can evolve, some researchers say, the new study and an accompanying paper on rapid evolution in fruit flies suggest that scientists have a real hope of observing the evolution of new species in the wild as it happens. This previously unimagined opportunity could shed light on the origin of new species, a critical and elusive processes in the evolution of life on earth.</p>
        <p>In the new salmon study, researchers say one population appears to have evolved into two distinct groups that have begun to stop interbreeding freely, taking the first step on the pathway to becoming separate species, not after centuries or millennia, but in just over 50 years.</p>
        <p>''There was no precedent for this at all in the wild,'' said Dr. Andrew P. Hendry, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Massachusetts, who worked with four colleagues in Washington State. ''It took a leap of faith even to look for it.'' In the same issue of Science, Australian researchers report evidence that other, but similarly crucial, changes distinguishing two fruit fly species evolved in a mere six months.</p>
        <p>The evolution of new species, a process known as speciation, is notoriously difficult to study, and most researchers claiming to have definitive results on the matter find themselves quickly challenged. Indeed, as soon as the new Science papers were released some top researchers in the field were declaring the studies critically flawed.</p>
        <p>''This is much ado about very little,'' said Dr. Daniel J. Howard, an evolutionary biologist at New Mexico State University, echoing others who took issue with the methodology and conclusions of the salmon study. ''They're claiming more than they can with what they've got.''</p>
        <p>But others, like Dr. Nick Barton, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh, who wrote a commentary that was published with the two studies, praised the new work. Describing the fly study as important and the salmon paper as ''a remarkable example,'' Dr. Barton wrote that the studies provided such strong evidence that speciation could happen quickly that they raised the question, ''Why do we not see more species?''</p>
        <p>According to the standard definition, two groups of organisms are considered different species when they have evolved to the point where they cannot successfully breed with the other group. They either never mate with each other or, if members from the two groups do mate, their offspring fail to thrive and reproduce -- a state of so-called reproductive isolation.</p>
        <p>But, scientists have long wondered, how quickly can reproductive isolation evolve?</p>
        <p>In an attempt to answer that question, Dr. Hendry and his colleagues took advantage of the fact that, in 1937, sockeye salmon were introduced into Lake Washington near Seattle. In 1992, when researchers began studying the fish, they discovered that the original stock appeared to have evolved into two different groups of salmon. One group of salmon laid its eggs at a lake beach while another group, somewhat different looking, bred in a river that feeds the lake. More important, researchers say they also found evidence that the two groups appeared to have developed slight genetic differences.</p>
        <p>The reason, the authors concluded, was that the two kinds of salmon were no longer fully successful at interbreeding, but had instead begun to become reproductively isolated. By doing so, researchers say, the salmon have taken the first step -- in just over half a century -- on the road to becoming different species.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hendry said he believed that rapid evolution of reproductive isolation was not likely to be confined to fish and would be found in other organisms as well. He also emphasized that the two kinds of salmon were not two different species at this point and, depending on the future of these populations, might never reach such a level of differentiation.</p>
        <p>Scientists critical of the work said other factors, including interbreeding by one of the groups with the small populations of native salmon known to live in the lake, could cause the salmon to appear genetically distinct from each other without the evolution of reproductive isolation. Others said the genetic differences between the salmon were too minuscule to require explanation yet.</p>
        <p>''It's less of a difference than that between human races,'' said Dr. Howard, pointing out that the genetic difference between the salmon was also less than that between different groups of house mice or crickets. ''It's so small that it's just not worth worrying about right now.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. David N. Reznick, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California at Riverside, who studies rapid evolutionary changes in guppies, called the new study compelling. Dr. Reznick said such small genetic changes were to be expected in view of the short time frame. ''To be honest, I'm surprised that you can find anything,'' he said, noting that the kinds of evolutionary changes he detected in guppies were incremental even over a decade. But while slow within a human lifetime, he said, such changes need to be considered over much longer periods of time, like that of the fossil record. ''If you can see it happening at all, the rate at which it's really happening is enormous,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the fruit fly study, researchers studied molecules, known as hydrocarbons, on the fruit flies Drosophila serrata and Drosophila birchii. The two are Australian relatives of Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly that can be found on rotting bananas in kitchens around the world.</p>
        <p>Hydrocarbons, which fruit flies perfume themselves with in species-specific blends, are known to be important in courtship, apparently assisting flies that taste the hydrocarbons on prospective mates in sorting their own species from others.</p>
        <p>Where the two species are found together in nature, serrata flies produce a blend of hydrocarbons distinct from the birchii's. Serrata flies taken from regions without birchii produce a different hydrocarbon blend. Those flies also have more trouble finding serrata mates when raised along with birchii flies.</p>
        <p>Hoping to watch evolution in action, the Australian team took serrata flies from areas without birchii and exposed them to birchii flies in the laboratory. As expected, the serrata flies evolved a blend of hydrocarbons that much more closely matched those found in wild serrata that live with birchii -- but to the researchers' surprise, they did so in just nine generations, or six months.</p>
        <p>As with the salmon study, some scientists quickly took issue with the Australian team's conclusions. Those who agreed with the conclusions, however, described the research as yet more proof that new species could evolve more quickly than imagined. Whatever their opinion of the new work, scientists seemed to agree that the research would inspire many in the field.</p>
        <p>''It's going to spur a lot more study,'' said Dr. Mohamed A. F. Noor, an evolutionary biologist at Louisiana State University. ''It'll be exciting to see what happens with these species in the future.''</p>
