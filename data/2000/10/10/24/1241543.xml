        <p>A sacred ceremony that traditionally lasts three days was theatrically condensed into less than two hours on Saturday night. The event, presented by the World Music Institute, was called ''The Sound of Ecstasy and Nectar of Enlightenment: Buddhist Ritual Song and Dance From Korea.'' And the performers were Buddhist monks from temples in the Seoul area who are associated with the Young San Preservation Group.</p>
        <p>This organization preserves the Young San Ceremony, an elaborate tribute in honor of Buddha. The group's leader is Dong Hee, the first woman to be associated with the ceremony and a pupil of Song-am Park, the scholar who helped preserve it. The monks are currently appearing for the first time outside their country on a tour under the auspices of the Korea Society.</p>
        <p>Much of the presentation was devoted to chants with flowing melodic lines punctuated by gongs, drums, chimes and wind instruments. The monks, who were clad in long-sleeved gowns, also occasionally made music as they moved. Their dances featured stately walks and bows at an unhurried pace. In an especially striking scene, they wore towering headdresses and carried clusters of blossoms.</p>
        <p>At all times making music and dancing seemed not primarily aesthetic activities, but religious expressions. Transferred to a theater, the Young San Ceremony retained its spiritual integrity.</p>
