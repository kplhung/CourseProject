        <p>When Douglas Daft, chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, first introduced his ''think local, act local'' strategy earlier this year, it sounded to many like a radical departure from the centralized, monolithic culture that had prevailed at Coke in recent years.</p>
        <p>In may ways, it was. Mr. Daft's predecessor, M. Douglas Ivester, earned a reputation for making all but the smallest decisions himself, leaving many Coke executives around world with the numbing sense that they could do little without his direct approval.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Daft's emphasis on local autonomy throughout Coke's worldwide distribution system bears a striking resemblance to the company's earlier philosophies, particularly during the 12 years that an affable executive named Don Keough was president and chief operating officer.</p>
        <p>Nothing could have demonstrated that point more clearly than Mr. Daft's humble announcement to Coke employees yesterday that from now on, Mr. Keough would officially serve as an adviser to the company's board and to Mr. Daft. It is a role he has played informally all year.</p>
        <p>''I'm a sounding board,'' said Mr. Keough, a longtime friend of Warren E. Buffett and Herbert A. Allen, two prominent Coke board members. ''And Doug's a good listener.''</p>
        <p>The appointment comes at a critical time for Coke, as it struggles to restore its image in the face of a racial discrimination lawsuit and investigations into its competitive practices by overseas regulators. Since he became chief executive at the beginning of the year, Mr. Daft has repeatedly stressed the need to rebuild the company's ties with international officials and distributors around the world.</p>
        <p>To that end, Mr. Daft has overhauled many of the company's international divisions. A few weeks ago, he split the company's immense Latin American division into three territories, giving local Coke officials more flexibility and control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daft has also promoted foreign nationals to oversee operations in countries where their cultural expertise might make relations with regulators smoother. The change is particularly evident in Europe, where French regulators blocked Coke's acquisition of the Orangina brand from Pernod Ricard last year and where the company had been criticized for what was characterized as a sluggish response to a contamination scare in Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>
        <p>Many view Mr. Keough's appointment as equally, if not more, important. As president from 1981 to 1993, Mr. Keough, along with Roberto Goizueta, Coke's chief executive at the time, is often credited with steering Coke into its golden age. During that period, earnings consistently increased close to 20 percent each year, and the company's stock jumped from less than $2 a share to more than 10 times that amount.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Keough as adviser, analysts say, Mr. Daft is hoping to convince employees and investors that the company is finally poised to regain its former strength.</p>
        <p>Mr. Keough may also play a key role in the potentially sticky negotiations between Coke and its bottlers. After a price war with PepsiCo cut deeply into their profits, major bottlers like Coca-Cola Enterprises, a publicly traded company whose stock has fallen roughly 60 percent in the last two years, are pressing for better terms with Coke on a wide range of issues, from soda prices to vending machines.</p>
