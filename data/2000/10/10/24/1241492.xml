        <p>The 2000 World Series will forever be remembered as the one in which Roger Clemens threw the barrel of a broken bat (choose one) at, near, in the vicinity of, in a space unexpectedly intruded upon by Mike Piazza. It will not be remembered as the World Series in which Clemens threw a baseball (his version) at the first-base line at least 45 feet off from first base.</p>
        <p>It's too bad another bizarre Clemens act has intruded on a game or a Series because the Yankees are in position to achieve greatness in this World Series, and nothing should dilute the attention their achievement would merit.</p>
        <p>With victories tonight and tomorrow night at Shea Stadium, the Yankees would gain a sweep of the four-of-seven-game contest. But it would not be an isolated sweep. It would be their third successive sweep, as in one in 1998, one in 1999 and one in 2000. As in it has never happened before in the history of the World Series.</p>
        <p>Seventeen of the first 95 World Series ended with one team winning four games, the other winning none. That is the definition of a sweep (the definition of an out-of-control pitcher is Roger Clemens). Only two teams before the 1998-99 Yankees scored two successive sweeps. They were also called the Yankees, the Yankees of 1927-28 and the Yankees of 1938-39. But neither of those teams reached the World Series the following season.</p>
        <p>That leaves these Yankees with the opportunity to make history. And what impressive history it would be. The three-tiered playoff format has made the road to the World Series a minefield. The Atlanta Braves know that, having won nine consecutive division championships but only one World Series in that period. But the Yankees not only have played their way into three consecutive World Series, they have also won every game they have played in them.</p>
        <p>''It is remarkable when you think about it,'' David Cone said at Shea Stadium yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Mets, who are also playing in this World Series, aren't conceding anything (not even that Roger Clemens has intimidated them). ''Are we in awe or thinking we're going to roll over and die?'' Al Leiter said. ''Hell, no.'' But, he added, ''We haven't played good baseball.''</p>
        <p>Darryl Hamilton, when asked whether he could comprehend the significance of so many sweeps, said: 'I'm not focusing on them sweeping. I'm focusing on winning Game 3.''</p>
        <p>If the truth be told, the Yankees aren't thinking sweep either. At least that's what some of them said, and they probably mean it. Players don't think like journalists and fans (Clemens doesn't think like other players either). They are busy playing the game. The rest of us have idle time in which to think up all of these possible milestones and achievements.</p>
        <p>''I try not to,'' Paul O'Neill said when asked if he had thought about the team's sweeps. ''Coming into this series, you know how important every game is. If you can win the first four, obviously you don't let the other team in it. As soon as you lose a game, it seems the momentum changes. We've never come into a World Series expecting to sweep anybody. We're playing good teams and I think we have a way of just playing to win that night. That's how it's happened.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill recalled how the Yankees returned from Atlanta last year with a pair of victories, then won a 10-inning 6-5 Game 3 at Yankee Stadium. ''That could have gone either way,'' O'Neill said. ''You don't assume anything. Last night fans were leaving when it was 6-0 and they got the tying run to the plate.''</p>
        <p>The 1999 game could epitomize the Yankees' style of postseason play. Down by 5-2, the Yankees scored a run in the seventh on a home run by Tino Martinez (Piazza has hit home runs against Clemens, who has hit him with a baseball and almost with part of a bat), then tied the game in the eighth on a two-run home run by Chuck Knoblauch and finally won on a home run by Chad Curtis in the 10th.</p>
        <p>''It seems like we find a way to get it done,'' Derek Jeter said.</p>
        <p>Cone noted that the Yankees have won their way through half of this World Series even though they had the worst won-lost record of the eight playoff teams.</p>
        <p>''It lends credence to the notion that postseason experience matters,'' he said. ''It does. We're living proof of that. A lot of people say postseason experience is overrated. Not in here.''</p>
        <p>Entering Game 3 of this World Series, the Yankees would seem to be in good position to win it because Orlando Hernandez is pitching against Rick Reed. Hernandez has started nine postseason games without losing; he has an 8-0 record. Reed lasted three and one-third innings in his last postseason start. (Hernandez once threw his glove, with a ball in it, to first base for an out, but unlike Clemens, he has never thrown a bat in the direction of a batter. He said he had no opinion on what Clemens did because he wasn't watching.)</p>
        <p>Before Hernandez is introduced as the starting pitcher tonight, Clemens will join the Yankees' other nonstarters for their collective introduction. The bulk of the boisterous barrage of boos almost certainly will salute him.</p>
        <p>Sandy Alderson, the Major League Baseball executive who deals with such matters, said yesterday it had never occurred to him not to include Clemens in the introductions.</p>
        <p>''Maybe he'll be in the bullpen -- conveniently,'' Alderson said, grinning.</p>
        <p>One place Clemens maybe shouldn't be is on the mound. Players were asked yesterday about the potential danger posed by someone who admits to being in such an emotionally charged state that he thinks a broken bat is a baseball, that he doesn't see a batter running to first and he doesn't hear a player asking him why he did what he did, and who throws baseballs 99 miles an hour from 60 feet 6 inches. Should he be allowed to be in that position?</p>
        <p>''That's one of the perspectives here,'' said Todd Zeile of the Mets, who called Clemens's bat toss ''an act of absolute stupidity.''</p>
        <p>Asked a similar question, Piazza said: ''Obviously, that should be something taken into consideration. Where it goes, I don't know. I don't know what the process is.''</p>
