        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel formally opened talks today with Ariel Sharon, the rightist opposition leader, on forming a coalition government as gun battles with Palestinians erupted again on the edge of Jerusalem and with no end in sight to the violence.</p>
        <p>The talks on a coalition recessed for a day after the first disagreements cropped up, but both leaders seemed intent on overcoming resistance in their own parties to joining forces.</p>
        <p>Both men are said to have a strong interest in forming a coalition.</p>
        <p>By bringing Mr. Sharon into the government, Mr. Barak, who has lost his majority in Parliament, could escape a vote by lawmakers for early elections. He could also win broad public support for his policies in the  confrontation with the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon is seeking a veto on future concessions in any peace talks, and by entering the cabinet he would improve his position against his main rightist rival, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Recent polls have given Mr. Netanyahu a better chance of defeating Mr. Barak if elections are held.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak has argued that the current wave of Palestinian protests and rising tensions on Israel's border with Lebanon require a broad-based government. But Israeli peace advocates and Palestinian officials have warned that bringing the hawkish Mr. Sharon into the government will  effectively bury any hope of peace, sending a final signal that Mr. Barak has given up on negotiations.</p>
        <p>Palestinians assert that Mr. Sharon's visit to the sacred plaza around  Al Aksa Mosque in Jerusalem's Old City last month, with a thousand armed policemen, set off the current wave of protests. Mr. Sharon is hated by many Palestinians for leading Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, during which Christian militiamen killed hundreds of Palestinians at refugee camps in Beirut.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Barak announced a timeout in peace efforts on Sunday,  resistance in his cabinet and the reported displeasure in the Clinton administration with his move have left him hedging on that pledge.</p>
        <p>Campaigning in New York, Mr. Clinton said today that the sense of accomplishment over the recent peace negotiations had been ''punctuated and overshadowed now by the terrible violence in the Middle East,'' though he said that he believed both sides were still committed to a peace accord.</p>
        <p>Regardless of how Mr. Barak chooses to call it, peace talks seemed a distant mirage today as violence between Israelis and Palestinians flared again on the southern outskirts of Jerusalem, with another gun battle that brought the fighting close to home for many Israelis.</p>
        <p>A Palestinian in the West Bank town of Beit Jalla opened fire with a machine gun on Gilo, a neighborhood built on West Bank land annexed to Jerusalem that the Palestinians instead consider a Jewish settlement.</p>
        <p>An apartment building was hit but there no casualties, and Israeli tank gunners posted under Gilo responded with long bursts of heavy machine-gun fire and two tank rounds. Palestinians reported two people wounded when a shell landed near an ambulance, as well as damage to buildings.</p>
        <p>The nightly firing at Gilo by hit-and-run squads of Palestinian gunmen provoked an Israeli helicopter strike on Beit Jallah Sunday night. The fighting, during which bullets have flown into Israeli homes and rockets have damaged Palestinian houses, has frightened residents on both sides of the firing line.</p>
        <p>Israelis and Palestinians sit at home after dark with their shades drawn, and streets in Gilo are darkened to hide potential targets. One exposed street has been lined with a wall of concrete barriers.</p>
        <p>Shooting at Jerusalem is seen as especially sensitive by Israeli officials, and army officers have suggested that stiffer retaliation could lie in store if the firing does not stop.</p>
        <p>''I truly advise them that if they allow firing from their houses on Gilo that they leave their homes, because we will respond,'' said Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the army chief of staff.</p>
        <p>Col. Marcel Aviv, the Israeli commander of the Bethlehem area, issued a sharper warning. ''Every house from which there will be firing will simply be destroyed,'' he said on army radio. ''Every vehicle from which there will be firing will be destroyed.''</p>
        <p>Under pressure from Gilo residents and the mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert, to retaliate with greater firepower, army officers seem to be walking a thin line, trying to avoid wholesale attacks that could cause serious civilian casualties.</p>
        <p>Such losses were narrowly averted in Sunday night's attack when a tank round destroyed a children's bedroom in Beit Jalla minutes after their father moved them to another part of the house. Other homes were damaged by machine-gun fire and by rockets fired by helicopter gunships, but there were no casualties.</p>
        <p>Inspecting the damage in Beit Jalla today, townspeople described a night of fear in which they huddled in closed rooms with crying children. Some complained that the firing at Gilo from among their houses was putting them at risk, forcing them to absorb retaliation after the gunmen had sped away.</p>
        <p>''We are against that shooting and we are working to stop them, but it's not easy,'' said Mayor Raji Zeidani. ''It's hard to know who they are. They pass through town in a minute and you can't find them.''</p>
        <p>The Israeli retaliation ''is just terrifying the citizens, it is inhuman and it will not help stop it,'' the mayor added, asserting that the Palestinian authorities were trying to halt the shooting.</p>
        <p>There were other shootings at Jewish settlements in the West Bank after dark. After an exchange of gunfire near Jewish settlement enclaves in Hebron, Palestinians reported that a father of four had been killed, and his children wounded.</p>
        <p>In earlier sporadic stone-throwing clashes, a 13-year-old Palestinian boy was reported to have been critically wounded when he was hit in the head by a rubber-coated steel bullet near a settlement enclave in the Gaza Strip. A roadside charge went off near a convoy of settlers' cars in the area, but no one was hurt.</p>
        <p>Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief in the West Bank, said that the violence could be curbed if Israel began dismantling Jewish settlements, around which many of the recent weeks' clashes have flared.</p>
        <p>Faced with such declarations and with no immediate prospect of resuming peace talks, Mr. Barak sat down with Mr. Sharon today to try and hammer out agreement on a broad-based government.</p>
        <p>A written invitation by Mr. Barak said that a government of national emergency was necessary because Palestinians had broken agreements with Israel and chosen the path of violence, and in view of tensions on Israel's border with Lebanon, where three Israeli soldiers were recently kidnapped by Hezbollah and an armed infiltration attempt was foiled over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak is reportedly resisting attempts by Mr. Sharon to have a veto over any future peace moves, keeping options open for a possible renewal of negotiations. Mr. Sharon has demanded agreement in advance on policy guidelines, hinting that without it, he could press in Parliament to topple Mr. Barak and call early elections.</p>
        <p>''If he wants us in the government, we must be able to have a real influence on the diplomatic process,'' said Silvan Shalom, a leader of Mr. Sharon's Likud Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon insisted that he was not only seeking veto power. Diplomatic and security policies must also be agreed upon first, he said.</p>
