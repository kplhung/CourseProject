        <p>GOLDSTEIN-Ethel. Died October 20, 2000 at 93 years old. Beloved mother, grandmother, greatgrandmother, friend and colleague. She was a loving support to all who knew her, a pioneer who began her second career at age 60 at N.S. Bienstock where she remained until age 93. Her memory and spirit will always be with us.</p>
        <p>GOLDSTEIN-Ethel. We note with tremendous sadness the passing of our friend and colleague who was a driving force as our office manager for 33 years. She was one of a kind. In 1968 at age 60, she came to work with us and maintained the same importance to the company until earlier this year when she succumbed to a stroke at her desk, the effects of which resulted in her passing last Friday evening. We respected her, loved her and will miss her very much. The Staff of N.S. Bienstock, Inc.</p>
