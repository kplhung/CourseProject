        <p>A dispute that has brought environmentalists into conflict with the World Trade Organization was revived today when Malaysia accused the United States of failing to revamp its laws to allow unrestricted shrimp imports.</p>
        <p>In a 1998 ruling, a W.T.O. panel struck down the United States ban on shrimp imports from countries that could not prove that their fishing fleets were taking measures to protect endangered sea turtles. Agreeing to a request by Malaysia, one of several countries that brought the original complaint, the W.T.O. agreed to investigate whether the United States had complied with the decision.</p>
        <p>Malaysia said that the United States ''has failed to take the necessary measures to allow the importation of certain shrimp and shrimp products in an unrestrictive manner.'' Malaysia could impose retaliatory trade sanctions if the panel finds that the United States has not complied with the W.T.O. decision.</p>
        <p>The United States trade delegate, Rita Hayes, said the government was not required to overhaul its laws, but only to bring their administration in line with trade arbiter's recommendations.</p>
        <p>The W.T.O. dispute settlement body's deliberations are behind closed doors, but Ms. Hayes's office released a statement noting that the administration was ''puzzled'' by Malaysia's contention. ''We offered to send a high-level delegation to Kuala Lumpur to discuss Malaysia's concerns,'' she said. ''Malaysia, however, declined our offer.''</p>
        <p>Pakistan, another country that brought the initial challenge, has agreed to adopt methods to protect turtles, a change that has resulted in the restrictions on its shrimp catch being lifted, she noted. Revised United States regulations allow shrimp imports from fleets using a ''turtle excluder'' device, which provides a channel of escape for them.</p>
        <p>Reopening the shrimp-turtle case is uncomfortable for administration trade officials, who insist that the United States government has complied with all unfavorable rulings. It also comes at a time when some of the W.T.O.'s 138 members are increasingly restive over uneven results from the body's dispute settlement system, which was designed to assure countries could not dodge their free trade obligations.</p>
        <p>High-profile disputes between the United States and the European Union have dogged the smooth working of the system. Administration trade officials say the European Union has not renovated its bananas importation program or dropped its ban on hormone-treated American beef even though the W.T.O. has found them in violation of free trade rules. In turn, the Europeans say the United States has not brought its system of multibillion-dollar tax breaks for exporting companies in line with a W.T.O. ruling against it.</p>
        <p>A group of countries led by Japan, proposed altering the dispute settlement process last week, reflecting worries that the rules' vague language is allowing countries to skirt their obligations.</p>
        <p>Under the revision, countries would not be authorized to use retaliatory trade sanctions until the W.T.O. process had run its course, and the trade arbiter decided that the losing party had failed to comply.</p>
