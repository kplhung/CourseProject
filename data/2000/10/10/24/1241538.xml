        <p>Kremerata Baltica  Carnegie Hall</p>
        <p>Now that the Kremerata Baltica has repeatedly proved its worth in concerts and recordings, it is hard to appreciate the risk Gidon Kremer was taking when, in founding this ensemble some four years ago, he conferred his good name on it. But Mr. Kremer, who was born in Latvia and has long been the most thoughtful and unconventional of violin virtuosos, was undoubtedly already aware not only of the extraordinary quality of many young musicians in his native region but also of his remarkable gift for inspired leadership.</p>
        <p>By now a superb group with an interesting repertory, the Kremerata made its Carnegie Hall debut on Friday evening, falling back perhaps too heavily on earlier New York triumphs. It had, for example, presented both Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons'' and Piazzolla's ''Four Seasons of Buenos Aires'' before, though not interleaved, as here (and on a Nonesuch recording). Still, it is always revelatory to hear Mr. Kremer, beautifully complemented by soloists from within the orchestra, breathe new life and creativity into material as overworked as the Vivaldi, and impart a certain gravity to potentially lightweight music like the Piazzolla (as arranged by Leonid Desyatnikov).</p>
        <p>In ''Musica Dolorosa,'' a compelling work by Peteris Vasks (though also a repeat), the Kremerata, 22 strong, showed that it could play without Mr. Kremer, every bit as well as conductorless ensembles of longer standing. Naida Cole, a young Canadian pianist, rivaled Mr. Kremer in virtuosity in Schnittke's Concerto Grosso No. 6, a structural novelty that the violinist joins only in the second movement, as the orchestra drops out for a time.</p>
        <p>After all the repeats, an extended encore by Giya Kancheli, ''Little Daneliada,'' was welcome, the more so in that it showed the composer in an uncharacteristically impish mood, calling on the players to vocalize in amusing ways.</p>
