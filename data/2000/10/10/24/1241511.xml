        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Changing our transportation infrastructure from black (asphalt) to green (sidewalks and trails) provides people with opportunities to be more physically active while going about their business (''Planning Healthier Suburbs, Where Cars Sit Idle and People Get Fit,'' Oct. 17).</p>
        <p>But people needn't watch less TV to do it, as suggested. As the column mentioned, a large percentage of trips that people make -- to work, school, or shopping -- are quite short. A path or a sidewalk network provides the opportunity for a person to make a trip by foot or bike.</p>
        <p>Green infrastructure has many benefits. When I commute by bike I get four things: I get to work, which I need to do anyway; I save the gas or transit fare; I get exercise without needing to carve out extra time for it later; and by not starting my car I don't add to congestion and air pollution. It seems we have come full circle from Olmstead's vision and it only took us 100 years to do so.</p>
