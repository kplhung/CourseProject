        <p>LADY art dealers are typecast as a brass-knuckled bunch, but what kind of woman would slug it out in court with the sole artist she has represented -- forsaking all others and getting rich along the way -- for nearly three decades? Who would take a swing at Al Hirschfeld, the 97-year-old caricaturist designated as a living landmark by the New York Landmarks Conservancy?</p>
        <p>Margo Feiden, the woman who uses a Hirschfeld caricature of herself on her brownstone's doorbell, hangs a Hirschfeld shower curtain in the powder room and runs a Hirschfeld-only gallery at 699 Madison Avenue, would -- if provoked. Nobody fires Ms. Feiden for insubordination. She's the boss.</p>
        <p>But thanks to a settlement drafted this month by skeptical lawyers -- can this collaboration be saved? -- Ms. Feiden is back to selling Hirschfelds after a summer of sparring.</p>
        <p>She calls Mr. Hirschfeld a drawing-board revolutionary, an artist with a line superior to Rembrandt's, a genius. A meal ticket? The blue eyes issue a flash-freeze: ''When we started out he was famous, but illustration did not sell.'' She does not bother saying the rest: that it sells now.</p>
        <p>When she finally got marriage right, on the third take, she even married a man who resembled him, the jeweler Julius Cohen. They met when he came to buy a Hirschfeld.</p>
        <p>''It's a dynasty,'' she says of the Hirschfeld legacy. No, she didn't create it, but she's spent half her life promoting it.</p>
        <p>Ms. Feiden, stop hiding beneath that pirate hat and confess how it felt to have Mr. Hirschfeld accuse you of breach of fiduciary duty, to describe you in court papers as ''malicious'' and ''intimidating.'' She twirls a tendril of her waist-length hair -- she's 55 but still projects precocity. Then she shrugs off the court-speak as ''boilerplate stuff; I knew we'd get back together.''</p>
        <p>We know she says she made it into the 1986 Guinness Book of World Records for producing ''Peter Pan'' on Broadway at 16 (a 10-day 1961 version with actors from the High School of the Performing Arts). We know she says she skipped so much school setting her record that James Madison High refused her a diploma, so she talked her way into Hofstra.</p>
        <p>We know she's a plane-flying, camel-racing Mensa member, a mother of two who takes tea at 4. Actually, she ignores the tea and crumpets her assistants arrange like props. Why? The cortisone she takes for a muscle disorder has given her a Dorian Gray face and made weight an issue.</p>
        <p>HENCE her big-selling reference book, ''The Calorie Factor'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1989). Along with many Hirschfelds, it bought this Stanford White town house in Greenwich Village around the corner from the original gallery on East 10th Street, where she slept on the floor and her kids slept in their playpen after her first husband decamped in 1970.</p>
        <p>''I used to sleep on the floor; now I've got five floors to choose from,'' she says as we chug upstairs through a never-never land of swooping arches and acres of vintage glassware and art -- Ms. Feiden owns too many Hirschfelds to remember how many. She's huffing as we reach the ''Treehouse,'' a room that was, rumor has it, Jimmy Stewart's lookout in Hitchcock's ''Rear Window.''</p>
        <p>Three hours into tea-time chat, we're still skirting the mystery of the summer-long schism with Mr. Hirschfeld, who took her to court in May. Two weeks ago, armed with a 36-page contract that the artist and his legal team say greatly expands his control over his work, he rehired her. Ms. Feiden, accepting their terms, says the contract offers protection for both sides. It seems the turf war that erupted when David Leopold, a former employee of Margo Feiden Galleries, befriended Mr. Hirschfeld and began to curate his museum exhibits, is moot.</p>
        <p>Please, Ms. Feiden, weigh in on the reconciliation.</p>
        <p>She does so with closed eyes, testing the words, tossing them out like fishing line, reeling some back for fear they might ''agitate Hirschfeld.'' Agitating Mr. Hirschfeld is against the (new) house rules.</p>
        <p>''If we have to have a fight every 30 years, so be it,'' she says. ''When a relationship is decades old, it can survive things a new relationship can't. I think we needed a marriage counselor, and lawyers are the marriage counselors in this theater.'' (She says her lawyers cost $374,000.)</p>
        <p>On a ruminative roll now:</p>
        <p>''It's like, when you've been married to someone for 30 years and you say, 'Would you do it all again?' ''</p>
        <p>You mean you feel like you've renewed your vows?</p>
        <p>''That's the wonder of this, that we're back together again!''</p>
        <p>The first genius in Ms. Feiden's life was her father, an electrical contractor with a zest for learning that rubbed off on her, an only child in Flatbush. She was in fourth grade before she realized that not everybody reads the encyclopedia from A to Z. Her mother was an actress who swapped career for marriage. Later, her mother obtained a stockbroker's license when Ms. Feiden was 16. ''It was unheard of, like telling you my mother is a quarterback in the National Football League.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Feiden rented her first art space in 1969. She saw a for-rent sign and envisioned a gallery where a dog-groomer had been. Her inaugural exhibit? Photographs by her pal Diane Arbus. They didn't sell, but Raphael Soyer's paintings did, which was how she met Mr. Hirschfeld. He wandered in to browse in 1970, noticed a photograph of her with an airplane and quizzed her.</p>
        <p>''That's my hobby,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Any woman who can fly an airplane can sell my art,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So she did. Make that does.</p>
