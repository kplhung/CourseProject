        <p>At Stewart International Airport near Newburgh, N.Y., they are promoting a new corporate hangar, dreaming about helicopter shuttles to Manhattan and dubbing themselves the ''Gateway to the Hudson.'' At MacArthur Airport in Islip, N.Y., they are hoping to add four gates to a refurbished terminal, buoyed by the recent arrival of Southwest Airlines. At Lehigh Valley International Airport near Allentown, Pa., 10 miles from the New Jersey state line, they are buying 1,500 acres of adjacent land and hoping to extend a runway to the lengths found at Kennedy or Newark International Airports.</p>
        <p>At almost every regional airport within a 90-minute drive of New York City, operators are renovating, upgrading or expanding, in what urban planners and aviation groups consider the busiest -- and most contested -- flurry of activity ever at these medium-sized complexes.</p>
        <p>For supporters, these projects are transforming sleepy outposts into vibrant, congestion-free alternatives to La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark Airports. But with that push has come more resistance, rippling farther and farther into the suburbs, from citizens' groups worried about noise, the environment and sprawling development.</p>
        <p>Now, with La Guardia declaring limits on additional peak-hour flights, Westchester County Airport and Teterboro Airport mulling flight curfews and the appetite for air travel showing no signs of abating, the stakes have never been higher. How these battles play out will influence local economies, regional transportation and suburban landscapes for years to come.</p>
        <p>''Economic development promoters are recognizing that their local airport has been a diamond in the rough, so this is definitely their moment of opportunity,'' said Janine Bauer, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a coalition of environmental and planning groups. ''But it is also the next big battleground over sprawl, because the question is, is there a plan for growth, or is it just economic development and more sprawl?''</p>
        <p>The same dynamic is playing out at small airports in metropolitan areas from Los Angeles and Chicago to Minneapolis. In all, more than 650 groups are trying to curb or shut down 3,300 airports. At the same time, aviation groups and some members of Congress want a national policy to aggressively build more airports, like the policy that fostered the interstate highway system, said James K. Coyne, a former Pennsylvania representative and president of the National Air Transportation Association, a trade group.</p>
        <p>''It's a real yin and yang thing,'' he said, ''where as a society we want the benefit of this transportation, but we don't understand that there's no free lunch.''</p>
        <p>In the last five years, federal money for all airports has almost doubled, enabling smaller airports to undertake more ambitious development and maintenance projects, said Bill DeGraaff, assistant manager of the airports division in the Federal Aviation Administration's eastern region office.</p>
        <p>The number of corporate flights, particularly those originating at regional airports, has doubled over the last six years, Mr. Coyne said. One Chicago company, Indigo Business Air Service, started regular jet charter service between Midway Airport in Chicago and Teterboro Airport in February, plans to start a Westchester-Midway shuttle by November and is considering a link to MacArthur Airport next year.</p>
        <p>And while the major New York area airports are also in the midst of construction projects, the congestion is getting much worse, due in part to a new federal law that, in the name of expanding service between New York and smaller cities, has crammed in more takeoff and landing slots.</p>
        <p>In August, delays at La Guardia doubled from the same period last year, prompting the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to announce limits in September on additional peak-hour flights. And while the major airports, for the most part, are limited in how much they can expand, suburban airports with ample land and modest flight schedules can grow significantly. Aviation groups and officials say the airports are spread out enough to accommodate the extra air traffic.</p>
        <p>Perhaps no airport has generated as much attention as Stewart, in New Windsor, N.Y., 55 miles north of New York City. Its longest runway, 11,818 feet, is second in the state only to  Kennedy's longest, at 14,572 feet. But Stewart's potential has not been fulfilled because of aging buildings, high fares and poor connections.</p>
        <p>In April, Stewart became the first airport in the country to be privatized under a new federal program, with management changing hands from New York State to National Express Group, a British company. Since then, the new operators have persuaded General Electric to build a new hangar, supported plans for a new highway interchange off Interstate 84, and worked hard to lure a low-cost jet carrier like Southwest.</p>
        <p>Last month, one corporate tenant, Rifton Aviation Services, sponsored a lavish event to unveil a new 120,000-square-foot, 46-foot-high corporate hangar. Eventually, Rifton plans to arrange business charters to England and helicopter shuttles to Manhattan and the Woodbury Commons outlet mall in Central Valley, N.Y., said Christian P. Domer, Rifton's president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>The expansion has also reinvigorated a longtime citizens' group, the Stewart Park and Recreation Coalition. Concerned that the expansion could adversely affect, or eat into, 7,000 adjacent acres of rugged open space, the group recently persuaded the Sierra Club to cite Stewart as New York State's worst example of sprawling development.</p>
        <p>Some opponents fear that increased airport activity could lead to more pollution and traffic, too much commercial development, a loss of open space and an additional burden on water and sewer systems.</p>
        <p>''You have a disaster in the making,'' said John Stouffer, legislative director of the Sierra Club's New York chapter. ''They are rapidly turning what was probably 15 years ago a fairly rural community into a choked suburban or semi-urban community.''</p>
        <p>The Trenton-Mercer Airport is similar to Stewart in that local officials and businesses are banking on revitalization to spur economic growth. Earlier this year, for instance, a former Grumman factory site was converted into an 80,000-square-foot hangar. With corporate flights increasing by double-digit percentages annually, the airport also decided to accommodate general aviation flights 24 hours a day.</p>
        <p>Now, the airport, which until a few years ago was called Mercer County Airport, is building a hangar for Merck, and is about to award a contract for one for Pfizer, said Justin P. Edwards, the airport manager. Both pharmaceutical giants have operations in New Jersey. Also, officials are assessing the environmental feasibility of a $18 million terminal that may include a movie theater, restaurants and stores.</p>
        <p>But not if Heidi Kahme can help it. A board member of People Limiting Airport Noise and Expansion, or Plane, which formed about a year ago, Ms. Kahme has been working with a Bucks County, Pa., citizens' group to call for more thorough environmental assessments and a halt to any expansion plans in an area that has sprouted many new subdivisions.</p>
        <p>''You're completely changing the character of the airport,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Her adversary is Steven E. Some, a Trenton lobbyist who is the president of People Restoring Opportunity, a coalition of business and labor groups that formed in June. To him, the expansion is crucial to wooing Southwest, which has told him of an ''intense desire'' to land in Trenton -- if the airport is modernized.</p>
        <p>He said a recent poll taken by his group found that 70 percent of local residents favored expansion. ''If it's not in my backyard but they want the services, what do you do?'' he said. 'Newark is impossible. La Guardia is too far. Kennedy is another country. Do we fold our arms and do nothing? The answer is no.''</p>
        <p>At MacArthur Airport, which is owned by the town of Islip, the issue is not the prospect of a rejuvenated airport, but the reality of one.</p>
        <p>Since the arrival of Southwest Airlines last year, the number of passengers has doubled to two million a year, other airlines have beefed up service and ticket prices have dropped precipitously. The airport completed a $14 million face-lift earlier this year, and would like to add more terminal gates and flights.</p>
        <p>But the progress, critics say, has come at a high price, epitomized by pollution and the sound of airplanes rattling chandeliers. So three years ago, some residents founded the Citizens for the Enforcement of MacArthur Airport Control; this year the group staged an anti-airport rally that drew 250 people.</p>
        <p>It is basically the same story with the Lehigh Valley airport near Allentown -- roughly an 80-minute drive from Newark -- which wants to tap into the fast-growing, corporation-rich central New Jersey market.</p>
        <p>The airport recently completed a land acquisition program for 1,500 acres, and hopes to extend its runway to 10,000 feet. Citizens for a Safe and Quiet Airport was founded in June. Last month, supervisors in one town passed regulations to limit noise and restrict the expansion.</p>
        <p>Even smaller airports without commercial service, like Republic Airport in Farmingdale, N.Y., the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Airport outside Bridgeport, Conn., Morristown Municipal Airport in Hanover, N.J., and Solberg Airport in Hunterdon County, N.J., find themselves at odds with some residents because of proposed expansions. To an extent, these airports, as well as some others, are now experiencing what some of the busy inner-ring airports, like Teterboro and Westchester County, have wrestled with for years.</p>
        <p>At Teterboro, only seven miles from New York City in Bergen County, N.J., aircraft noise has been a big issue. In 1987, the airport established a noise-monitoring system, and promised to ban aircraft that exceeded 90 decibels. Since then, Teterboro has banned more than 60 planes, said Phil Engle, the airport manager.</p>
        <p>But to residents, that is not enough.  A few weeks ago, the Carlstadt Borough Council passed a resolution to initiate a class-action lawsuit to force the Port Authority and the federal government to reduce airplane noise.</p>
        <p>Now, with corporate travel consisting of 90 percent of Teterboro's operations, compared with less than half 10 years ago, the airport is repaving a runway and planning for additional taxiway room to accommodate bigger but quieter jets like Falcons and Gulfstreams, which are quickly replacing noisy turbo-propeller planes throughout the industry. But to residents, such plans sound like a recipe for bigger ambitions.</p>
        <p>Westchester County Airport, meanwhile, has long been in a delicate position because of its proximity to the Kensico Reservoir, a conduit for 90 percent of New York City's drinking water, and the clout of environmentalists and local officials.</p>
        <p>The county executive, Andrew J. Spano, would prefer to keep the airport as a boutique operation, snuffing out plans to expand a business lounge and blocking the construction of a new hangar by General Electric (which went to Stewart).</p>
        <p>Now there is a dispute with Atlantic Southeast Airlines, a Delta subsidiary, over the airline's new 5:59 a.m. flight from Westchester to Atlanta, which residents have complained is too early. Two weeks ago, a bipartisan group of congressmen introduced legislation that would impose a mandatory curfew. And because the airport is busy enough as it is, Mr. Spano said that he would not mind if some passengers or flights opted for Stewart or other satellite airports instead.</p>
        <p>Arline L. Bronzaft, chairwoman of a new group concerned about airport  noise, the Aircraft Noise Abatement Group of New York and New Jersey,  said the competing pressures for adding air service and maintaining a suburban or semirural quality of life would be hard to reconcile.</p>
        <p>''We have the need for people who want to get away as quickly as they can, and then we have the people on the ground saying, 'We're living here.' Something is going to have to be very Solomon-like in coming out.''</p>
