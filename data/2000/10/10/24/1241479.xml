        <p>Rick Reed suggested one way that the Mets could retaliate appropriately for Roger Clemens having thrown a broken bat at Mike Piazza.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to turn the other cheek when a situation like this happens,'' Reed, who will start Game 3 of the World Series tonight, said yesterday. ''But I guess to get back, just to win the World Series. Just to win it outright, I guess. That would be the payback, for now.''</p>
        <p>Reed makes his first World Series start and with the ball in his hands, he will dictate what direction the Clemens-Piazza saga takes. Reed conceded that he would try to pitch the Yankees on the inner part of the plate, but only because he must do that to be successful. The incident in Game 2 on Sunday night will not change Reed's pitching style, he said, although any pitcher would be silly to admit that it would change his approach.</p>
        <p>Reed holds strong feelings about Clemens, who took the shattered barrel of Piazza's bat in the first inning and heaved it in Piazza's direction along the first-base line. Reed said he had felt that Clemens was intentionally throwing the splintered wood at Piazza and should have been ejected for it.</p>
        <p>Clemens, who remained in the game, pitched eight shutout innings in a 6-5 Yankees victory to give them a two games to none advantage in the series.</p>
        <p>''There was no room in this game for what he did,'' Reed said. ''I thought he threw the bat at him. My thing is, let's reverse the role. If Mike throws his little piece of the bat at him, he's gone. That's why I feel that he should have been tossed.''</p>
        <p>Reed should have plenty on his mind tonight. Late this afternoon, he will probably roam the home clubhouse at Shea Stadium in the same zombie-like state that precedes each of his starts. He stalks the Mets' locker room half clothed, making less eye contact with people than a typical subway rider. He will be unable to forget that the Mets trail the four-of-seven-game series, and he will anticipate his first World Series start.</p>
        <p>Lesser circumstances caused Reed to become nervous in his last start, during the National League Championship Series. He was confident yesterday that he would be more relaxed tonight.</p>
        <p>Based solely on statistics, this could be a mismatch. Orlando Hernandez, who will start for the Yankees tonight, has never lost a postseason start, and the Yankees have a 14-game winning streak in the World Series. Reed has a 5.79 earned run average this postseason and has allowed 15 hits in nine and one-third innings.</p>
        <p>In his career, Reed is 0-2 with a 5.26 E.R.A. in five games against the Yankees, although he did not face them in interleague play this year. He thrives by locating his pitches and, with nine days off since his last start, he will have to guard against being too strong and leaving his pitches high in the strike zone.</p>
        <p>Reed allowed two runs to the San Francisco Giants in six innings of Game 3 of the division series, which the Mets eventually won on Benny Agbayani's 13th-inning home run. Reed also had the Mets' only loss during the N.L.C.S.</p>
        <p>He allowed five runs, four earned, in three and one-third innings. Al Leiter said he had spotted something from the dugout.</p>
        <p>''You could see it in his eyes,'' Leiter said. ''He just didn't look as confident.''</p>
        <p>Leiter told Reed about what he had seen. Reed admitted that he had been nervous in that start, and he attributed that to the pressure of trying to get to the World Series.</p>
        <p>''I guess the nerves just took over,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His mechanics suffered and he tried to locate his pitches too precisely. Reed said he did not feel the added pressure of tonight's start would affect him, but he could not explain why.</p>
        <p>Reed believes he will enjoy the game tonight, realizing it might be his only World Series start. Reed did not get the chance to end his season last year on his own terms. In the N.L.C.S. last year, he was preparing to warm up in Game 6 before Kenny Rogers's bases-loaded walk sent the Atlanta Braves to the World Series. Reed would have pitched a Game 7 if there had been one. He kept waiting for a chance to pitch that never came.</p>
        <p>This year, Reed would pitch the seventh game of the World Series if the Mets get that far. For that to happen, Reed would almost certainly need to win tonight.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to have fun with it,'' he said. ''It may never happen again.''</p>
