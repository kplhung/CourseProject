        <p>In the combustible aftermath of the second game of the World Series, the insistent matter on the minds of opinionated New Yorkers yesterday was the deeper meaning -- or, in fact, any meaning -- of a thrown piece of splintered wood.</p>
        <p>In weighing why Roger Clemens hurled a stump of a broken bat in the vicinity of his nemesis, Mike Piazza, during the first inning of Sunday's game, fans of both teams found themselves examining ticklish questions of neuroses and courage and retribution, not to mention instructive ways to control anger.</p>
        <p>Mets fans, in reacting to the continuing morality play starring the pitcher and slugger, were largely unwilling to allow that the bat fragment was thrown by accident. How could it have been, they reasoned, after Clemens had already clunked Piazza in the head with a baseball during the regular season? As far as they could see, Clemens must have a demented obsession with tossing things at Piazza -- balls, bats, hula hoops.</p>
        <p>''It was intentional,'' said Richard Meadows, 37, a police officer who had been working at the game. ''You could see the anger in his face.''</p>
        <p>By watching Roger Clemens's mouth, he could also see him mumbling to Mike Piazza that he thought the bat piece was the ball. ''That's ludicrous,'' he said. The officer said that pitchers, more so than even the other position players, easily knew the difference between a ball and a chunk of bat with a jagged edge to it. ''You know, like one is round and one is not,'' he pointed out.</p>
        <p>''There is no need for a pitcher to ever hit anybody,'' said Maria Mier, 38, an account executive at a copier company, who roots for the Mets. ''This is what they do. When a surgeon goes in and does a heart operation, he doesn't go, 'Oh. I'm sorry, I attached the wrong artery.' You don't do that. What Clemens did was deliberate.''</p>
        <p>So what was he thinking?</p>
        <p>''If I had to guess,'' she said, ''maybe the fact that Piazza is so liked and so popular and outspoken. Maybe he was thinking, I want to shut this guy up.''</p>
        <p>Joe Abrams, 42, a steam fitter and Mets fan, said, ''Clemens is a hell of a pitcher and not much of a human being.''</p>
        <p>A lot of Met fans were outraged that Clemens was not ejected from the game. Now they had alternative ideas for suitable punishment.</p>
        <p>''Clemens should be clubbed like a baby seal,'' said Larry Blatt, 37, who drives the ice-resurfacing machine at Chelsea Piers. ''He's a gutless player.''</p>
        <p>Jimmy McHugh, 68, a bartender in Queens, said, ''I'd love to see Piazza walk into a bar and see Clemens and rap him. Piazza is a man and Clemens is a creep.''</p>
        <p>Wherever you mentioned the Yankee pitcher on the street yesterday, you got a reaction. Unasked, people put in their ideas.</p>
        <p>Eric Skoy, 41, a waiter and actor and committed Yankee fan, was expressing himself on a Midtown Manhattan corner: ''I think Roger Clemens intentionally threw the bat at Piazza. The tension had built up. But at that split moment, I think what Clemens thought was that somehow Piazza was deliberately sending that bat at him.''</p>
        <p>This was a popular attempt at explanation subscribed to by certain Yankee fans. That in the unimaginable pressure of a World Series game, or at least in the unimaginable workings of Roger Clemens's brain, the pitcher concluded that Piazza had somehow schemed to have his bat explode so that one pointy piece of it would whip toward the mound.</p>
        <p>Some Yankee fans took this a step further. They suggested that Piazza actually came to the plate with a bat that he knew was already cracked so that it was sure to burst in just that fashion. And if someone fires a bat at you, they pointed out, it's only fair that you get to fling it back.</p>
        <p>Gus Miliotis, a 63-year-old financial consultant, was passing by -- passing by, in fact, from St. Louis, where he lives. ''What, you're defending Clemens?'' he said to Eric Skoy, giving him a hard stare worthy of Clemens himself. ''Clemens humiliated New York. He humiliated the sport. He humiliated the country.''</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying it was right,'' Mr. Skoy said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miliotis said: ''The guy is senile. He has a disease.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Skoy: ''I wouldn't go that far.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Miliotis: ''He couldn't control his emotions, so he became an animal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Skoy gave a really disgusted look. ''This guy doesn't know what he's talking about,'' he said. ''Clemens is 38 years old. What do you mean, senility?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Miliotis: ''That is bush league. The guy should be thrown out of the World Series.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Skoy: ''Will you please give me a break.''</p>
        <p>There are any number of Yankee fans who agree that Mr. Clemens did a rather bad thing on purpose, and they openly deplored the behavior. ''I was hoping Torre would take Clemens out,'' said Kimberly Smith, 28, an artist, referring to the Yankees' manager, Joe Torre. ''I was very impressed with Piazza's behavior. I think the incident took him off guard a little. I think he would have been well within his rights to go crazy. I think he had the right to take Clemens out at that point.''</p>
        <p>Carlos Mojica, 22, a building engineer, said he had never gotten over Roger Clemens's coming to the team in the first place. ''He is basically a mercenary,'' he said. ''I never considered him a real Yankee and I never will.''</p>
        <p>Where many other Yankee fans differ from Met fans, however, is that they still really like Roger Clemens. ''Any guy who can throw like that in such a crucial situation is a guy I want on my team,'' said Chris Horgan, a hotel company executive and Yankee devotee. ''If being a tough, mean guy helps him do it, so be it.''</p>
        <p>In the minds of many fans, the problem was entirely a temper issue. ''Roger came out looking like someone who doesn't have much control over himself, and he needs to work on that,'' said Noelle Barbera, 25, an opera singer.</p>
        <p>A number of people took the occasion to be helpful. They suggested ways that Clemens could learn to keep his anger in check. These included protracted psychotherapy, working with disadvantaged children, Prozac, writing over and over, ''I am a calm person,'' and giving up baseball for something like fishing.</p>
        <p>Pressed hard, no one thought there was a very high likelihood that he would follow any of these courses of action.</p>
        <p>There was a companion issue in this morality play. Was it good or bad that Piazza didn't slug Clemens? Was it good or bad that the Mets didn't start a brawl?</p>
        <p>Any number of Mets fans were disappointed that the Mets didn't beat up the Yankees. Some questioned the team's courage. Yankee fans didn't feel the need to question the Mets' courage. They already knew they had none.</p>
        <p>''Piazza should have gone after him,'' said Henry Fiol, 21, a teacher's aide and Mets fan. ''Someone throws a bat at him, he should have hit him.''</p>
        <p>Other Mets fans were rational about it. The game, they pointed out, was in the Bronx, before Yankee fans. The Mets did want to live to play Game 3.</p>
        <p>There were other ways to frame it. ''I think the Mets showed their courage in not fighting,'' said Jim Allen, 79, a messenger and Mets fan. ''These guys are not boxers.''</p>
