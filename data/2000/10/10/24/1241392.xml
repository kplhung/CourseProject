        <p>Vic Nardozza seems like a character out of a confusing dream: he's Kramer but at the same time he's not Kramer; he is a detective at an agency where the photographer is a recovering voyeur; he is controlled by people who have trouble figuring out what week it is. This is not some surreal trick but the misbegotten premiere of ''The Michael Richards Show.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richards arrives with enormous good will and likability from his days as Kramer on ''Seinfeld,'' and as Vic he displays many Kramer qualities. There are the loose limbs, the raised eyebrows, the startled look.</p>
        <p>Yet Vic has no personality of his own. He is as bumbling as Kramer but doesn't seem to be a brilliant detective savant. Who knows what he is?</p>

        <p>Vic Nardozza seems like a character out of a confusing dream: he's Kramer but at the same time he's not Kramer; he is a detective at an agency where the photographer is a recovering voyeur; he is controlled by people who have trouble figuring out what week it is. This is not some surreal trick but the misbegotten premiere of ''The Michael Richards Show.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richards arrives with enormous good will and likability from his days as Kramer on ''Seinfeld,'' and as Vic he displays many Kramer qualities. There are the loose limbs, the raised eyebrows, the startled look.</p>
        <p>Yet Vic has no personality of his own. He is as bumbling as Kramer but doesn't seem to be a brilliant detective savant. Who knows what he is?</p>
        <p>We do know he has had a rocky journey. The show's original pilot was revamped and cast members added. A few weeks ago the new first episode was finally sent to critics. It is predictable and banal. Investigating a rich geezer who might be doing drugs, Vic puts on many disguises, which at least plays to Mr. Richards's gift for physical comedy. But the characters around him are lame, and several first-rate actors wasted. Tim Meadows plays the voyeuristic photographer, Bill Cobbs, a grumpy old detective, and William Devane is the almost-as-grumpy owner of the agency. The script is awful, but as a first episode it suggests the broad sitcom humor and visual jokes the series is going for.</p>
        <p>But wait. Recently NBC decided to show that pilot at some later date and replace it with yet another premiere.</p>
        <p>The episode scheduled for tonight  (barring a last-minute reprieve from the governor) is actively bad, even incompetent. When Vic is hired to investigate a man's unfaithful fiancee, he becomes the bait, though it takes half the show to arrive at that obvious point.</p>
        <p>As he fumbles his way through the case, even the physical humor is mishandled. When Mr. Richards tumbles backward out a window, the camera is at a skewed angle and he is almost hidden by another actor. When he asks the fiancee to dance, the scene seems truncated; yet, additional film of Mr. Richards's gangly Krameresque dance is used under the closing credits.</p>
        <p>The series seems to be going in reverse, getting worse instead of better, as if it were trapped in the backward episode of ''Seinfeld.'' The apparent problem is how to capitalize on the Kramer character yet create something new. Trying to have it both ways, the creators of the show seem caught in their own nightmare.</p>
        <p>THE MICHAEL RICHARDS SHOW  NBC, tonight at 8  (Channel 4 in New York)</p>
        <p>Spike Feresten, Gregg Kavet, Michael Richards and Andy Robin, creators and executive producers; Ron Zimmerman and Dan Greaney, co-executive producers; Suzy Mamann Greenberg and Brian Kelley, supervising producers; Mark Driscoll, consulting producer. Written by Gregg Kavet and Andy Robin; directed by Asaad Kelada.</p>
        <p>WITH: Michael Richards, William Devane, Bill Cobbs, Amy Farrington and Tim Meadows.</p>
