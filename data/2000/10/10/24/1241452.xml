        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio today intensified his criticism of Hillary Rodham Clinton's failed health care reform effort six years ago, unleashing a new series of advertisements and deriding her effort as ''bad medicine for New York.''</p>
        <p>The multipronged offensive, 15 days before the election, represented an effort by Mr. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, to attack his Democratic opponent on an issue his advisers say is among Mrs. Clinton's most vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton fired back by criticizing Mr. Lazio's Congressional voting record on health care issues, saying bills he supported would have deprived New York of billions of dollars in health financing -- cuts that her campaign argued would have crippled hospitals across the state. She also hammered away at Mr. Lazio for never issuing a proposal of his own to improve the health care system.</p>
        <p>Just a few days after he released his first television commercial criticizing her health care proposal, Mr. Lazio today released radio advertisements tailored to each of several upstate markets that assert, among other things, that Mrs. Clinton's plan would have put ''one-seventh of our economy under government control.'' They also mention Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's criticism at the time that the plan would devastate teaching hospitals by reducing the number of foreign medical graduate students. In an interview today, Mr. Moynihan rose to Mrs. Clinton's defense, noting that she supports his current legislative efforts to finance the hospitals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has often called Mrs. Clinton's former plan a ''disaster,'' but he had never offered a detailed critique until today. And he resurrected ammunition used by leading Republicans at the time, arming himself with charts to show how complex her proposals were.</p>
        <p>The congressman called Mrs. Clinton's failed proposal the most glaring example of her attempt to legislate. As Mr. Lazio seized on an issue that remains of critical importance statewide, the first lady enjoyed the benefit -- for the second day in a row -- of having her husband, President Clinton, stump around the state extolling her years of public service in an attempt to rebut Mr. Lazio's charge that she has no record.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton appointed the first lady to lead a task force in 1993 that, largely in secret, developed a proposal to remake the nation's health care system. The panel's goal was to clamp down on soaring health costs and guarantee that all Americans would have health insurance. Mrs. Clinton has said that she made a mistake in trying to push such an ambitious proposal through a Republican-controlled Congress. Legislators contended at the time that she was trying to do too much at once and criticized her for an unwillingness to compromise. The plan failed in 1994.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said Mrs. Clinton's proposal would have cost at least 72,000 jobs (he said at various points of the day 73,000 and 75,000), citing a report by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group of state legislators. Mr. Lazio also reprised criticism from the time that teaching hospitals could be threatened with closure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who has issued multibillion-dollar proposals aimed at improving education and cutting taxes, did not offer a health care plan of his own. When asked why by reporters, he did not respond but said he would continue to support legislation that would help people pay for insurance through such means as tax credits.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's plan, he said, was ''bad medicine for New York, it was bad medicine for America and that's why people from both parties threw up their hands and said we cannot have this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio stood in front of a chart, prepared in 1994 by Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, that depicts a tangle of boxes and lines meant to illustrate Mrs. Clinton's plan and to emphasize its obtuseness.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, he said, designed and pushed the plan in a way ''contrary to the kind of process that you would have if you were an effective legislator, reaching out, building consensus and listening to different views, even criticisms.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''It's very important for a good legislator to listen to criticisms so they can meet that criticism and overcome it if they can. But that was not the experience of Mrs. Clinton.''</p>
        <p>''We have two different visions of health care,'' Mr. Lazio said, ''one that would provide more choice and empower patients and physicians, to have more control over their health care decisions, and one that would entrust federal bureaucrats and give people fewer choices and less control over their lives.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, speaking to reporters after touring a retirement center in New Rochelle, conceded today that she should have proceeded more cautiously on health care reform, but she stood by the concept.</p>
        <p>''I think that everyone acknowledges that it could have been done differently and better,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''But it was taking on a very important challenge, a big issue facing us then, and facing us now, which is: How do we provide quality, affordable health care to every American?''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Lazio had not offered a comprehensive plan.</p>
        <p>''My opponent has still not told us what his plans are,'' she said. ''He has no health care agenda; just an agenda of attacks and insults.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''I think this election is about you. My opponent thinks it's about me.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign office released a statement that attacked Mr. Lazio for his support of a 1995 budget proposal that she said would have eliminated $24.4 billion for New York hospitals and would have reduced Medicare and Medicaid financing. Her campaign office included a list of hospitals around the state that it said would have lost millions, from Buffalo to Long Island.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton lent her support today to another health care proposal, one offered by Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman that would double the penalty for health maintenance organizations  that drop older Americans on Medicare. The managed care groups that withdraw such coverage now are prohibited from returning to a market for two years. Under the Gore-Lieberman proposal, that ban would be four years, Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>''It is this simple: H.M.O.'s with a record of cherry-picking their patients or leaving their seniors in the lurch should not be allowed to do business with Medicare,'' she said. ''It is just wrong that the H.M.O.'s could entice seniors to sign up and then dump them from coverage with very little notice.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Moynihan, the Democrat whose seat Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton are vying for, expressed concerns that his initial criticisms would be misconstrued as opposition to the concept of universal health care. Although he stood by his quote, he said, ''I was very much in favor of a health care plan.''</p>
        <p>He said he took offense at Mr. Lazio's using his name in the radio  advertisements, as he did when Mr. Lazio used his image in a television advertisement earlier this year.</p>
        <p>''I do not enjoy seeing my name in Mr. Lazio's advertisements,'' Mr. Moynihan said, ''because it gives the false impression that I support him, and I do not.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 25, 2000, Wednesday  An article yesterday about Rick A. Lazio's criticism of the health care overhaul proposed by Hillary Rodham Clinton in 1994 misstated her explanation of its legislative failure. She has said that she made a mistake in trying to push so ambitious a proposal through Congress. She did not blame Republican control of Congress; Democrats controlled the House and the Senate in 1994.</p>
