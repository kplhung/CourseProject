        <p>An Internet postage company, Stamps.com, of Santa Monica, Calif., said yesterday that it would cut 40 percent of its work force, or 240 full and part-time employees, to reduce its costs to try to become profitable. The company, which first sold shares to the public at $11 each in June 1999, closed at $2.78 a share yesterday. Stamps.com, which is issuing third quarter earnings on Wednesday, saw its second-quarter loss widen to $52.3 million, from $5.71 million a year earlier. The announcement of layoffs comes just two weeks after the resignations of the company's chief executive. A former United States postmaster general, Marvin Runyon, is serving as interim chairman.</p>
