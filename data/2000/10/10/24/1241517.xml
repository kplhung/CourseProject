        <p>Ikea, the home furnishings retailer, said yesterday that it was beginning a review for its account, with billings estimated at $40 million.

        <p>Joakim Gip, marketing manager at Ikea North America in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., part of Ikea Svenska, said the company was seeking a ''revitalization of our communication program.''

        <p>Ikea, the home furnishings retailer, said yesterday that it was beginning a review for its account, with billings estimated at $40 million. Deutsch in New York, which has handled creative, media, direct marketing, interactive and other tasks for Ikea for 11 years, has decided not to take part.</p>
        <p>Joakim Gip, marketing manager at Ikea North America in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., part of Ikea Svenska, said the company was seeking a ''revitalization of our communication program.'' Pile and Company in Boston will manage the review, and a decision is expected in December or January, he said.</p>
        <p>Vonda LePage, a spokeswoman at Deutsch, said the agency would not participate in the review ''because we stand by the great strategic and creative work that we've done to help make Ikea a household name.'' The account helped Deutsch gain a reputation for unconventional approaches to prosaic product categories; one commercial, for instance, featured actors playing a gay male couple shopping for furniture in an Ikea store.</p>
