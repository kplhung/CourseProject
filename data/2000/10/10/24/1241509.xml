        <p>The article ''How the Body Knows When to Gain or Lose'' strongly supports the notion that biology determines one's weight.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article ''How the Body Knows When to Gain or Lose'' strongly supports the notion that biology determines one's weight. The article draws upon a range of evidence ranging from animal to behavioral human studies indicating that weight is either controlled by biological factors or is highly resistant to change.</p>
        <p>Still, it is widely acknowledged that obesity has sharply increased in recent years and that other countries including those in Europe and Asia have far fewer obese people than the United States does.</p>
        <p>These facts suggest that biological factors do not tell the whole story, even as they suggest that lifestyle changes aimed at weight loss are futile.</p>
        <p>Such accounts of the weight epidemic in this country are clearly unhelpful in that they undercut any motivation one may have to engage in a healthier lifestyle in an effort to lose weight.</p>
