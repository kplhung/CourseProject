        <p>IF Roger Clemens were a 38-year-old Olympian, with a competitive fever running so much higher than the breathtaking double digits his fastball still registers on the radar gun, there might be a different standard of suspicion regarding the cause of his shocking behavior on the pitcher's mound Sunday night.</p>
        <p>Instead, within baseball's insulated and unscientific borders, there was only Mike Piazza to offer what was closest to a medical or a therapeutic observation on the man who flung the splintered barrel of Piazza's bat in the vicinity of the Mets' catcher early in Game 2.</p>
        <p>''I went out and confronted him and asked what his problem is,'' Piazza said yesterday at Shea Stadium. ''He seemed apologetic, confused, unstable.''</p>
        <p>Piazza left Clemens to deal with his demons, returning to where he at least had a statistical chance, albeit small, of a more honorable form of revenge. ''I wanted to go back and get a hit,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It may be of little consolation to Piazza, whose team trails the Yankees, 2-0, going into Game 3 tonight, to be applauded for his professionalism, for respecting the competition and especially the World Series stage. Shame on those who have criticized Piazza and the Mets for not sinking to Clemens's level, for letting the umpires and now baseball officials determine his fate.</p>
        <p>''What am I supposed to do, go out and tackle Roger?'' an animated Todd Pratt said. ''I'm a professional. But then I read we have no heart. That's the biggest joke I've ever heard.''</p>
        <p>Some suggested the Mets had to respond physically, after seething for more than three months following Clemens's hitting Piazza in the head. Clemens beat them in July and he bullied them for eight innings Sunday. It had nothing to do with courage, or fear.</p>
        <p>''What can you do when he's throwing a 99-mile-an-hour fastball?'' Pratt said.</p>
        <p>Get tougher? Breathe heavier? Swing harder?</p>
        <p>''This is not football, where you strap it on and get all ticked off,'' pitcher Al Leiter said. ''Just to be mad at a player is not going to help us. Baseball is about a nice delivery, a smooth swing, sound mechanics.''</p>
        <p>By the same token, Leiter admitted that, for most pitchers, for him, emotion is an edge that should be exploited.</p>
        <p>''I know that I get into it, and there's definitely an internal aggressive nature of every athlete that should be ticked off,'' he said. ''You have to have that fire. Within the dynamics of that, different human beings have different degrees of fire. Maybe Roger handles things differently. It seems to work for him.''</p>
        <p>Does it really? A better explanation for Clemens's domination in Seattle and again Sunday night was the extra rest that came between starts. Joe Torre and assorted teammates have, in fact, explained away many of Clemens's failures here by claiming he had wound himself too tight. Those of us who covered his 1990 ejection from a playoff game in Oakland can attest to how unhinged he seemed by the prospect of losing again to his then-nemesis, Dave Stewart.</p>
        <p>Days after Clemens joined the Yankees two springs ago, Stewart recalled that episode as the most amazing thing he'd seen in baseball, at least until Sunday night.</p>
        <p>One would expect George Steinbrenner to talk tough behind his bat-hurling right-hander, which the old football coach did Sunday night. Clemens may not be a Yankee from the traditional mold, but he sure is cast in the image of what the owner himself might have looked like in pinstripes.</p>
        <p>Bobby Valentine said he was holding no grudge against the Yankees organization. He admitted that he, too, defends ''most actions'' of his players. Then the Mets' manager added, none too cryptically, ''There's probably an exception to every rule.''</p>
        <p>Torre, familiar with the history and the hype, might have done a better job of calming Clemens beforehand, rather than saying, ''A pitcher has to be himself.'' He wound up blaming the news media, sounding more like a never-accountable jock than the paternal face of New York sports.</p>
        <p>His favorite Clemens likening has been Bob Gibson, an intimidating soul who pitched inside as if by birthright. Yesterday, Torre said his former Cardinals teammate had left him a message, probably, he admitted, to say, ''Stop dragging my name through that stuff.''</p>
        <p>Clemens went too far. There is a point where attitude, not intent, is the issue. Clemens could have taken an eye out with his sad demonstration of rage. Suspension from the Series, unlikely as that may be, would not be unjust.</p>
