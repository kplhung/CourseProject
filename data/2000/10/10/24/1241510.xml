        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was struck by the differences in cause and control of obesity in the two articles (''How the Body Knows When to Gain or Lose'' and ''One-Two Punch for Losing Weight,'' Oct 17).</p>
        <p>I am sure that the truth lies in both. Certainly the problem is multifaceted.</p>
        <p>I have been a runner (not a jogger) for the past 40 years. I now run about 30 miles a week. At age 74 I weigh from 115 to 117 pounds and am 5-foot-6.</p>
        <p>Forty years ago I weighed 155 pounds. I have always found it helpful to weigh before breakfast every morning. If my weight is up, I eat less that day.</p>
        <p>Maybe this type of anecdotal evidence will help someone to try the exercise and diet approach.</p>
