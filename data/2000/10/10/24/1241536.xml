        <p>A bye week has kept the Giants idle for several days, and while they have rested, by coincidence, the star quarterbacks for two coming opponents have sustained serious injuries. The Giants are focusing this week on the Philadelphia Eagles -- improving division rivals who come to Giants Stadium on Sunday -- but the landscape and preparation for the two pivotal games that follow have taken a quirky turn because of two freakish injuries.</p>
        <p>Last week, Tim Couch, whose Cleveland Browns play the Giants on Nov. 5, broke his thumb when he hit it on a defensive teammate's helmet in practice.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Kurt Warner of the St. Louis Rams, whom the Giants play host to Nov. 12, broke the right little finger on his throwing hand while taking a snap from scrimmage during the Rams' 54-34 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
        <p>Couch is out for the season. The Rams said Warner would miss four to six weeks. The Giants will either catch a break against the two teams or else run into a backup quarterback with something to prove.</p>
        <p>And then there is the opinion of Giants Coach Jim Fassel, who is not convinced that Warner is going to be out as long as the Rams have anticipated.</p>
        <p>''I've got a feeling he may beat that time frame,'' Fassel said. ''It's hard for me to imagine that he broke his little finger and he'll be out four to six weeks.''</p>
        <p>Giants quarterback Kerry Collins did not consider that time period unrealistic.</p>
        <p>''You use your little finger a lot throwing the football,'' Collins said.</p>
        <p>He added: ''I can't understand how he broke a finger on his right hand. I could understand the left hand very easily. I can't understand the right little finger.''</p>
        <p>When a right-handed quarterback positions his hands to take a snap from center, his right hand is higher than the left hand and is generally protected from the force of the ball being snapped.</p>
        <p>Fassel heard about Warner's injury while driving from Lake Placid, N.Y., where he took advantage of the bye week to spend the weekend with his wife, Kitty. He did not immediately begin to think about how things might change defensively for his Giants in a few weeks.</p>
        <p>''For one thing, the bottom line is that we've got a game with the Eagles,'' Fassel said. ''And besides, they've got another guy there they can get warmed up and ready now. Same for Cleveland; Doug Pederson is a good quarterback.''</p>
        <p>Warner's backup is Trent Green, a former starter who lost his job to Warner last year after an injury. Pederson has replaced Couch for the Browns.</p>
        <p>Linebacker Jessie Armstead almost seemed to hope that Warner would recover in time to face the Giants.</p>
        <p>''I want to beat them at their best,'' Armstead said when asked about Warner's injury. ''If I'm out there playing, that's what I want. I don't want people to say, 'Oh, but they beat them without so-and-so.' They've got a good backup, but anytime you lose the league M.V.P., it's going to be a blow to your team.''</p>
        <p>Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn, who is expected to be out with a cracked rib until at least the St. Louis game, said of Warner's injury, ''With my luck, he'll be healthy when I get back.''</p>
        <p>Sehorn did note that it was avoiding similar injuries that helped make St. Louis so formable a year ago.</p>
        <p>''They went through the season unscathed,'' Sehorn said. ''That's why teams go to the Super Bowl. They play injury free. Take it from me, that's hard to do. Injuries are part of the process.''</p>
        <p>But Sehorn's teammate Michael Strahan called the injuries to Couch and Warner ''freaky stuff.''</p>
        <p>Of Couch's injury, Strahan said: ''The first thing they teach you as a defensive lineman in this league is to not get near the quarterback in practice. You don't want to hit him or him to get hurt hitting you. As we say, that's the quickest way to get sent home.''</p>
        <p>Collins said: ''Yeah, but those guys don't always listen. I've had a number of times where I've said, 'Man, that was close.' ''</p>
        <p>In fact, Giants fans might want to count their blessings. Collins said today that he had X-rays on his right thumb during the Giants' game against Washington last month. He said he hit the thumb on an opposing player's helmet following through after a pass.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Giants linebacker BRANDON SHORT left Monday's practice with a sprained left ankle. Coach JIM FASSEL said he did not think Short was seriously injured. Fassel also said that he expected wide receiver AMANI TOOMER (hamstring) and nickel cornerback REGGIE STEPHENS (ankle) to resume practicing Wednesday. The team is off Tuesday.</p>
