        <p>As the destroyer Cole rounded the Cape of Aden 12 days ago and followed a pilot boat to its berth in Aden harbor, its arrival set off a flurry of activity at a ramshackle suite of offices near the port.</p>
        <p>Under lazy fans that cool the second-story walk-up on Ali Mohsen al-Meraisi Street, named for a 1960's soccer player who was Aden's equivalent of Mickey Mantle, shirt-sleeved shipping clerks at a small family-owned firm prepared to provide chandlering services to the Cole.</p>
        <p>Behind a fading sign declaring ''Al Mansoob for Ship Supply and General Trade,'' the company's owners proudly declare that their chandlering operations have made the company ''King of the Sea'' in these parts, though for the last 30 years this once crucial and proud port has been a backwater, and it may soon sink back into near-obscurity.</p>
        <p>Chandlering involves resupplying vessels with everything from paint and rope to fuel and fresh food and water, as well as clearing garbage and otherwise preparing ships to set to sea again. The Cole was a customer because Al Mansoob had the chandlering contract for all United States Navy ships, which started using Aden in 1999 to refuel ships moving between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf and the Far East.</p>
        <p>That meant that at least some of the staff at Al Mansoob's offices knew at least 48 hours in advance about the Cole's progress through the Suez Canal and into the Red Sea, that the ship was a guided-missile destroyer and that its arrival here would be the signal for a small flotilla of service boats, including at least two from Al Mansoob, to move around it like pilot fish.</p>
        <p>One of the two Mansoob boats was a barge sent to unload garbage. Another, according to Yemeni investigators, took at least one employee from Al Mansoob out to the ship, where he was when the bombing occurred that killed 17 sailors and 2 men on a skiff carrying the explosives. Thus Al Mansoob immediately became the focus of investigators after the Cole was attacked. Many of Al Mansoob's 35 employees, including the general manager, Ahmed al-Mansoob, and the man believed to have been aboard the Cole, Hussain Bakhateer, were detained by the Yemenis for questioning, although all but Mr. Bakhateer were later released.</p>
        <p>Now, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, working with Yemeni investigators, has determined that the bombers' skiff was not part of the service flotilla, having approached the Navy ship from a different direction, a remote boat ramp six miles to the west across the Bay of Aden.</p>
        <p>These discoveries appear to have prompted the investigators to review, if not abandon, earlier theories that the refueling operation was infiltrated by the bombers, perhaps with the connivance of the other service vessels, or part of some conspiracy in which the resupply operation was used as a decoy to allow the attack craft to slide alongside the Cole.</p>
        <p>But while the F.B.I. is following up a cascade of discoveries last week -- the boat ramp, an abandoned four-wheel-drive vehicle and a boat trailer believed to have been used by the bombers and five safe houses in Aden where the bombers may have prepared the boat and the bomb and tested an outboard motor -- Al Mansoob and its staff remain under the spotlight. Now, Yemeni investigators say, the focus is on determining whether the chandlering operation could have been used to gather intelligence about the Cole's docking plans or to time the attack so that it meshed unobtrusively with the service operation.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, longer-range inquiries by the F.B.I., the Navy and the Senate Armed Services Committee, which opened its own hearings in Washington last week, seem certain to focus on Al Mansoob as they seek to assess how thoroughly the Navy prepared its refueling operations.</p>
        <p>Inquiries made by reporters here and statements by Pentagon officials suggest that the firm's security was loose enough that determined conspirators might have had little trouble compromising it.</p>
        <p>Before the Cole was attacked, Mr. Mansoob, the general manager, had boasted that the Navy contract was pure gold. His reasoning, other chandlering agents recall, was that the Navy's seal of approval would entrench a dominance that the company had enjoyed since the distant days when Aden was a stopover for steamer passengers heading to and from British India and other destinations in the Far East.</p>
        <p>But now, the Navy contract looks as though it could turn into something more like lead for the company and for the port of Aden if the inquiry leads the Navy to conclude that refueling there will end.</p>
        <p>British, French and other foreign navies that have occasionally brought their ships here for service would be likely to follow the American lead. ''If Yemen is really going to begin moving economically, it's going to need a full recovery in Aden port,'' one of the American officials involved in assessing Aden's suitability before the 1999 contract was let said today at a briefing for reporters. ''And if there's no confidence in this port, international shipping will not come in -- it's that simple.''</p>
        <p>Before Yemeni investigators turned up the heat on the company, other reporters had conversations with Addullah al-Khalqi, the marketing manager, who said that most of Al Mansoob's employees were family members and that none had been checked for past involvement with criminal or terrorist activities. When asked why not, Mr. Khalqi replied, ''We believe their word.''</p>
        <p>Pentagon officials have said security checks for employees of Yemeni companies or other intrusive efforts to make sure that port operations were not vulnerable to infiltration impossible, given Yemeni concerns about sovereignty.</p>
        <p>The officials have been quoted as saying that any foolproof measures to secure the port would have required ''militarizing'' it.</p>
        <p>But leaving security to the Yemenis meant, in effect, that the Navy was relying on a government with a shaky record in dealing with terrorist groups. Although the American Embassy has praised the government for its efforts to crack down in the last two years, Washington has often been sharply critical about the government's laxity in allowing the issuing of false passports to terrorists, or leaving controls at the Aden port so lax that they could pass unhindered in and out of Yemen.</p>
        <p>Navy and embassy officials here have refused to detail what security arrangements, if any, were made to secure a perimeter around the Cole, saying such operational matters are not made public. One unanswered question has been whether the Navy posted picket boats in the harbor to warn off intruding boats. Since the attack on the Cole, a large inflatable Navy boat, 50 to 60 feet long with heavy machine guns mounted fore and aft and a crew of 15 to 20 sailors in helmets and flak jackets, has mounted a round-the-clock patrol around the Cole.</p>
