        <p>Emmanuel Villaume, a 36-year-old French conductor, has been named music director for opera and orchestra at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., in Charleston, S.C. Next year, in Spoleto's 25th season, he will conduct the Festival Orchestra in an opera and in a symphonic concert, neither of which has been chosen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Villaume made his American debut at Spoleto U.S.A. in 1990 with ''The Marriage of Figaro'' and has continued the relationship. He expressed his enthusiasm for the concept created by Gian Carlo Menotti, the founder of both the Spoleto Festival in Italy and Spoleto U.S.A., when he said: ''The idea was to have all the arts included, not only opera and orchestra, but also visual arts, dance and sculpture. It's a real festival.''</p>

        <p>Emmanuel Villaume, a 36-year-old French conductor, has been named music director for opera and orchestra at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., in Charleston, S.C. Next year, in Spoleto's 25th season, he will conduct the Festival Orchestra in an opera and in a symphonic concert, neither of which has been chosen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Villaume made his American debut at Spoleto U.S.A. in 1990 with ''The Marriage of Figaro'' and has continued the relationship. He expressed his enthusiasm for the concept created by Gian Carlo Menotti, the founder of both the Spoleto Festival in Italy and Spoleto U.S.A., when he said: ''The idea was to have all the arts included, not only opera and orchestra, but also visual arts, dance and sculpture. It's a real festival.''</p>
        <p>He said in a telephone interview that he was also drawn to Spoleto because it presented both the avant-garde and classics and it emphasized youth and the discovery of new instrumental and singing talent. He made it clear that he believed in encouraging crosscurrents between the musical arts.</p>
        <p>An orchestra demands ''care for exact sonorities'' and opera calls for dramatic effects, but, he said, the reverse is also true. It is his goal to bring drama to his symphonic work and ''precision, colors and respect for orchestration'' to opera.</p>
        <p>Mr. Villaume was a protege of Spiros Argiris, Spoleto's music director from 1987 to 1992 and from 1994 to 1996. Mr. Argiris died in 1996 and was succeeded by Steven Sloane, whom Mr. Villaume succeeds. He said that he learned conducting as an assistant to Mr. Argiris and also to Seiji Ozawa.</p>
        <p>He has conducted throughout Europe and across the United States, although not yet in New York. He has appeared with the Washington Opera, the Dallas Opera, the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the San Francisco Opera and has also worked with the Boston Symphony, Houston Symphony and many other orchestras.</p>
        <p>Mr. Villaume was born in Strasbourg, France, and was a student at the Strasbourg Conservatory. Later he studied literature, philosophy and musicology at the Sorbonne in Paris.</p>
        <p>At 21, he was named dramaturge at the Opera du Rhin in Strasbourg, where he was discovered by Mr. Argiris.</p>
        <p>As music director of the Spoleto Festival in Italy and of Spoleto Festival U.S.A., Mr. Argiris invited him to conduct at both festivals.</p>
        <p>In his new post, Mr. Villaume has a contract for three years and will share responsibilities with Joseph Flummerfelt, artistic director for choral activities, and Charles Wadsworth, artistic director for chamber music. Speaking of his first season with the festival next year, which will run from May 25 to June 10, he said he especially appreciated the connection between the community and ''the artists who propose a vision.''</p>
