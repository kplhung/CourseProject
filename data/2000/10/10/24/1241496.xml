        <p>Bad baseball is more painful than bad teeth. And after watching these last two games, we Mets fans are feeling as if we got a double root canal.</p>
        <p>It is hard to say what was most disturbing about Game 1: the Mets' base-running meltdowns; Billy Joel's flat rendition of the national anthem; or that creepy music they were playing during the pregame show. It was the Requiem in Stanley Kubrick's ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' if I am not mistaken.</p>
        <p>And the Mets ran the bases as though they had their eyes wide shut. ''They're playing like it was the Little League World Series,'' said Todd Schindler, a Mets fan who was drinking at Glacken's Bar in the heart of Mantle country at 149th Street and Walton Avenue in the Bronx. He was watching as the Mets were dismantled in Game 2.</p>
        <p>Here are some baseball basics: With two outs, you run on contact. You don't watch the ball sail over the fence. In Game 1, the ball bounced off the top of the fence, and Timo Perez, the Mets' right fielder, was thrown out at the plate. Cost: one run.</p>
        <p>Lost opportunity No. 2: In the ninth inning, the Mets had runners on second and third with only one out. The man on third, Todd Pratt, was held instead of running on contact. Even if Pratt didn't make it home on the ground ball, the Mets would still have runners on the corners with two outs. And when the Yankee second baseman booted the ball, Pratt would have scored. But the Mets were playing not to lose instead of playing to win.</p>
        <p>To be honest, the Mets just flat-out lost the second game -- Roger Clemens's bat-throwing antics and the Mets' ninth-inning rally notwithstanding.</p>
        <p>''The Mets are blowing the whole thing,'' Mr. Schindler said, somewhere around the bottom of his second whiskey and cola as he watched Mets pitcher Mike Hampton come undone. ''No Met pitcher comes off a good game and pitches a good game.''</p>
        <p>The libations are very strong at Glacken's -- a fifth of alcohol yields just eight drinks -- and this fueled a loudmouth Yankee fan who smelled out us five Mets fans standing at the wood.</p>
        <p>''It's too easy!'' the shiny-eyed Yankee fan kept screaming at us. ''It's too easy!''</p>
        <p>He passed out two innings later, his head back.</p>
        <p>When asked how a die-hard Yankee fan could find love for Clemens, the former Red Sox icon, someone said, ''Let Saigons be bygones.''</p>
        <p>And that's the whole thing about Yankee fans. They are not hungry. They are going through the motions as if the trophy were their birthright. They never sweat it. They fall asleep during games.</p>
        <p>We Mets fans, on the other hand, are believers. This thing ain't over.</p>
        <p>For instance, as Mets left fielder Benny Agbayani came to bat with one on in the seventh and the Mets trailing, 4-0, Mr. Schindler said, ''I'm starting to feel something here.'' Agbayani struck out swinging.</p>
        <p>It must have been the booze Mr. Schindler was feeling.</p>
