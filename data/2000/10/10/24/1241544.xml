        <p>THE uniform colors were the same: aqua and coral. But at Giants Stadium last night, the visiting team could not possibly be the Miami Dolphins because Dan Marino was not out there.</p>
        <p>For 17 seasons, the handsome, husky quarterback with 13 on his uniform was always out there tormenting the Jets by winging passes for more completions, more yardage and more touchdowns, by far, than he accumulated against any of the Dolphins' other National Football League opponents.</p>
        <p>But last night there was nobody in an aqua-and-coral uniform wearing 13 and licking his fingers as he came out of the huddle to survey the defense. Licking his chops really. So this visiting team couldn't possibly be the Dolphins. It had to be some other team. And in a way it was.</p>
        <p>These Dolphins, better known now for defense, blew a 30-7 lead as the Jets rallied behind Vinny Testaverde's five touchdown passes for a 40-37 overtime victory after the tackle-eligible Jumbo Elliott caught a 3-yard flip for the tying score.</p>
        <p>Marino, of course, announced last March that he had decided to stop playing football, stop throwing passes, stop trying to elude blitzing linebackers on his battered legs, stop wondering if the next sack would burn a pinched nerve in his neck, stop seeking a Super Bowl ring.</p>
        <p>As a rookie analyst on HBO's weekly pro football show, he still watches game films, but only to assess teams on television, not to drill holes in their defenses for a record 420 touchdown passes in his career.</p>
        <p>When the Jets were devising their defensive game plan for last night's game, Coach Al Groh had one fewer worry than Joe Walton, Bruce Coslet, Pete Carroll, Rich Kotite and Bill Parcells had: how to disrupt Marino from completing all those passes, especially when he needed a touchdown.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Marino's won-lost record against the Jets was 17-13 and his passing stats were awesome.</p>
        <p>In those 30 games against the Jets, he completed 656 of 1,125 passes for 8,651 yards and 72 touchdowns with only 36 interceptions. For some quarterbacks, those would be decent career numbers, but he did it against one team in a span of what amounts to less than two full 16-game seasons.</p>
        <p>Both the Jets and the Dolphins will never forget one pass for 8 yards and a touchdown on what has endured in Marino lore as the Clock Play.</p>
        <p>On the Sunday after Thanksgiving in 1994 at Giants Stadium, the Jets were leading the Dolphins, 24-21, in the final minute. If they held on, they would be 7-5 with a good shot at the division title. But with 30 seconds remaining, Marino moved the Dolphins to a first down at the 8-yard line.</p>
        <p>With a nod to wide receiver Mark Ingram, lined up to his right, Marino yelled ''Clock! Clock! Clock!'' and motioned with his right arm as if he planned to spike the ball in order to stop the clock. The Jets relaxed.</p>
        <p>But at the snap, Marino whipped a pass to Ingram, who had darted into the end zone past a relaxed Aaron Glenn, for an 8-yard touchdown with 22 seconds remaining. The Dolphins won, 28-24, and the Jets never recovered, losing their last five games.</p>
        <p>When the season ended, Carroll was canned.</p>
        <p>Bernie Kosar, then Marino's backup, had suggested the play and the Dolphins had practiced it, but had never used it in a game.</p>
        <p>''It was worth a shot,'' Marino said later. ''If we hit it, fine. If we don't, you have two more shots and then kick a field goal.''</p>
        <p>One shot was enough for one of Marino's 37 fourth-quarter comeback victories (five against the Jets); his 37 comebacks rank second in N.F.L. history to John Elway's 43. In that 1994 fourth-quarter comeback, he completed 15 of 18 passes for 164 yards and 2 touchdowns, including the surprise 8-yard dart.</p>
        <p>''With Dan,'' Don Shula, his Dolphin coach for 13 seasons, has said, ''you never felt you were out of a game.''</p>
        <p>Two of Marino's top-five yardage games occurred against the Jets. In a 1988 shootout with Ken O'Brien, the Dolphins lost, 44-30, but Marino completed 35 of 60 passes for his high of 521 yards and 3 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>In an overtime 51-45 shootout with O'Brien in 1986, he completed 30 of 50 for 448 yards and 6 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>So with Dan Marino not out there, last night's visiting team couldn't possibly be the Dolphins. But it was.</p>
