        <p>Ballet is not usually considered a contact sport -- at least not when all goes well on stage -- but that doesn't necessarily make it safer than football.</p>
        <p>A new study has found that professional ballet dancers are injured just as often, and just as seriously, as athletes who play rough sports.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ronald Smith of the University of Washington, writing in the journal Anxiety, Stress and Coping, based the conclusion on a study of 46 dancers with the Pacific Northwest Ballet Company in Seattle.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that the dancers had an injury rate of 61 percent in the eight months studied, a rate the study said was comparable to that for football players and wrestlers.</p>
        <p>The study looked at 31 men and 15 women, on average just over 26 years old.</p>
        <p>Defining injury as a medical problem that restricted participation for at least a day, the researchers found that the average time lost from injury was 10.5 days for the dancers.</p>
        <p>The goal of the study was to try to understand the psychology of injury among athletes and performers.</p>
