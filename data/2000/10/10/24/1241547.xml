        <p>An affiliate of the Hyundai Group, South Korea's largest conglomerate, says it plans to lay off about 25 percent of its top executives in response to mounting pressure to reduce its debts. The affiliate, Hyundai Engineering and Construction, the nation's largest contractor, said it would lay off 63 executives, close two local and four overseas offices, sell parts of its business and spin off 10 other units. The company has about 20,000 workers. It has been having difficulty meeting an end-of-the-year deadline for selling off its assets to take its debts below 4 trillion won ($3.5 billion) from the 5.1 trillion won goal its creditors are demanding.</p>
