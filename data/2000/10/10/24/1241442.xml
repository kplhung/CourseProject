        <p>Gov. George W. Bush said today that Vice President Al Gore's proposal for Social Security would create about $40 trillion in debt by the middle of the century, saddling future generations with an onerous burden and leaving the system of financing the program unfixed.</p>
        <p>''Long after Al Gore has left public office, the Gore debt will come due,'' Mr. Bush told a roaring crowd at a rally this morning in Kansas City, Mo., the first stop in a swing through crucial states in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>''And $40 trillion is a lot of money,'' he said, ''even for someone who has been in Washington most of his life.''</p>
        <p>At that rally and one in Des Moines, Mr. Bush hammered at Mr. Gore's plan to keep Social Security solvent into the middle of the century by paying down the national debt, then funneling the savings from interest payments into Social Security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides said the Gore plan was basically an accounting trick, a transfer of money from one place to another that would ultimately force the government to reduce spending or raise taxes. Mr. Gore's aides disputed that characterization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, by contrast, has proposed allowing younger workers to invest some of their payroll taxes in private retirement accounts, saying that they would get a higher return on the money. That, presumably, would relieve pressure on the Social Security system and would create a new source of financing.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush has not explained how he would make this fundamental change without, at some point, having to pump extra money into Social Security or reduce benefits. Many experts have said that the cost of this transition could be formidable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and other Democrats had spent much of the last week challenging Mr. Bush on that point and charging that he was endangering Social Security's ability to pay benefits to current retirees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush called that a scare tactic and produced the staggeringly high $40 trillion figure, guaranteed to grab headlines, to press his criticism that Mr. Gore was not reaching for bold solutions but simply reverting to an ingrained Democratic impulse to spend and spend.</p>
        <p>The governor presented the Social Security debate as an example of what he asserted was Mr. Gore's timidity, saying that the vice president was tinkering with problems that the country, in an era of prosperity, should solve once and for all.</p>
        <p>''That's not leadership,'' Mr. Bush told workers at an ink manufacturing plant in Des Moines. ''That's not somebody who's willing to take on the tough issues and lead.''</p>
        <p>''You know, borrowing money, loading up future generations with a bunch of i.o.u.'s -- that's not what a leader does in a moment of prosperity,'' he added. ''That's not a reason to run for office. A reason to run for office is to reform the system.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides said the $40 trillion figure was the amount, plus interest payments, that the government would have to transfer from the general fund into Social Security  by 2050 to keep the system solvent.</p>
        <p>The number came from a letter that the Congressional Budget Office sent last week to Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, in response to an inquiry about the president's Social Security plan. Bush aides said the vice president's plan was identical.</p>
        <p>But Gore aides questioned the arithmetic behind the number, along with the way the Bush campaign was interpreting it. They said the Bush campaign was ignoring a central fact: that the money Mr. Gore was proposing to transfer from the general fund to Social Security would be newly created savings on interest payments for the national debt.</p>
        <p>''George W. Bush is trying to make voters as confused as he is,'' said Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign. ''This is a highly desperate attempt.''</p>
        <p>But it illustrated how much attention Social Security was getting and how eager Mr. Bush was to frame his position as an example of the kind of innovative, fresh leadership he has pledged to take to Washington.</p>
        <p>He characterized Mr. Gore and the current administration as impediments to progress on issues like Social Security and Medicare because, Mr. Bush suggested, they were too mired in stale thinking and too addicted to partisan warfare.</p>
        <p>''The Clinton-Gore administration has blocked reform at every turn,'' Mr. Bush said in Kansas City, Mo.</p>
        <p>''For seven and a half years, the vice president has been the second biggest obstacle to reform in America,'' he said. ''And now he wants to be the obstacle in chief.''</p>
        <p>The language Mr. Bush used to deride Mr. Gore was as sharp as it had ever been, reflecting the tightness of the contest and the little time  before Election Day.</p>
        <p>The fanfare with which his rallies and events were staged also reflected this. In Milwaukee, where Mr. Bush ended the day, he appeared before thousands of people in an enormous auditorium. On stage with him were most of the women -- including his wife, Laura, and Cindy McCain, the wife of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona -- who had participated in a ''W Stands for Women'' tour in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush punched several themes today. He stressed that Mr. Gore did not trust Americans to make their own decisions, which is what he said people would be doing under his Social Security plan. He also contended that a Gore government would be a nonstop spending spree and, in doing so, seemed to indulge in the kind of partisan broadsides he was saying that a Bush administration would transcend.</p>
        <p>For example, he repeatedly sought to lump Mr. Gore with two liberal, failed Democratic presidential nominees, Walter F. Mondale and Michael S. Dukakis, by saying that their combined spending proposals were less than Mr. Gore's.</p>
        <p>In His Own Words</p>
        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH  Remarks yesterday morning at a rally at the Kansas City (Mo.) Downtown Airport:</p>
        <p>''Just because the federal government has a surplus does not mean every American family has a surplus. And our plan, our tax relief plan, helps families at the most important moments -- when they are getting married or having children or saving for education, buying a home or planning for retirement. This isn't one of those things they call in Washington a targeted tax cut for the few, but tax relief for all Americans who pay taxes.</p>
        <p>And we're going to save Social Security and Medicare. Every promise made to seniors will be a promise kept. Medicare must be modernized to include prescription drugs as well, Social Security be strengthened to give younger workers new options and new wealth. And both of these programs will be set on firm financial ground.</p>
        <p>I know what the political class says about Social Security. They call it the 'third rail' of American politics, the one that shocks you when you touch it. They've been saying that forever, as the problems of Social Security have gotten worse. But if you don't touch it, you can't fix it. And on this issue I intend to lead.</p>
        <p>During this campaign, Americans have seen my priorities. They have seen the issues near to my heart: better schools, fairer taxes, a stronger military, security for our seniors. These reforms are coming to Washington, D.C. In truth, in truth, we should have had them a long time ago. But something stood in the way. The Clinton-Gore administration has blocked reform at every turn. It came in  with ringing promises, and is now leaving with a sigh. For seven and a half years, the vice president has been the second biggest obstacle to reform in America. And now he wants to be the biggest. And now he wants to be the obstacle in chief.''</p>
