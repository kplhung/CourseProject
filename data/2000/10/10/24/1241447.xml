        <p>Two daily tracking polls show that Vice President Al Gore has regained some of the ground he lost to Gov. George W. Bush in recent weeks. While Mr. Bush maintains a marginal lead, it has narrowed each day since the final debate last Tuesday.</p>
        <p>When four of the polls taken since the debate are averaged together, Mr. Bush's support is 46 percent, Mr. Gore's 44 percent, Patrick J. Buchanan's support is 1 percent and Ralph Nader's is 4 percent.</p>
        <p>The sharpest shift was in a CNN/ USA Today/Gallup tracking poll. On Sunday, the poll showed Mr. Bush holding a nine percentage-point lead based on interviews conducted Thursday through Saturday. Yesterday, the same poll showed a two-point edge for Mr. Bush based on interviews conducted Friday through Sunday. In this latest poll of 769 likely voters, Mr. Bush was the choice of 46 percent of the voters, Mr. Gore the choice of 44 percent.</p>
        <p>An ABC News tracking poll conducted Friday through Sunday gave no edge to either man, with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore each receiving the support of 47 percent of the 1,070 likely voters polled. A day earlier, the ABC poll had Mr. Bush with a two-point edge.</p>
        <p>In a New York Times/CBS News poll taken Wednesday through Saturday, the shifting pattern was clear. Mr. Bush had a six-point advantage over Mr. Gore on the first day of polling; by the last day, Mr. Gore had a two-point advantage over Mr. Bush. In that standard telephone poll of 825 likely voters, Mr. Bush was the choice of 44 percent of those polled, Mr. Gore the choice of 42 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush had a more substantial advantage in a poll for Newsweek conducted Wednesday through Saturday by Princeton Survey Research Associates. That poll of 800 likely voters found Mr. Bush's support to be 48 percent and Mr. Gore's 41 percent.</p>
        <p>The ABC News poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The other polls each have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.</p>
        <p>In all the polls, Mr. Nader, the Green Party candidate, was supported by 5 percent or less of the voters, and Mr. Buchanan, the Reform Party candidate, was supported by 1 percent.</p>
        <p>A tracking poll is taken over several days with a different sample each day, while a standard poll uses one sample over several days.</p>
