        <p>In the last year or so, three companies based in Morris County have announced they were merging with bigger companies and closing at least part of their operations here. Now it is happening again.</p>

        <p>In the last year or so, three companies based in Morris County have announced they were merging with bigger companies and closing at least part of their operations here. Now it is happening again.</p>
        <p>The General Electric Company agreed Sunday to acquire Honeywell International, the diversified manufacturer that is based here. As part of the agreement, Honeywell will close its 550-employee headquarters here, although it will keep 1,750 workers in various businesses and laboratories here in place for now.</p>
        <p>Honeywell joins Warner-Lambert, Schering-Plough and GPU Utility, all of which have announced mergers with other companies and expect to close their headquarters here. This is in addition to last November's merger of Mobil Oil with the Exxon Corporation, which had 1,000 employees in its engineering division in Florham Park in Morris County, most of whom were relocated to Fairfax, Va.</p>
        <p>It is enough to make a region feel a bit rejected.</p>
        <p>But not Morris County. Officials with the county and the area's economic development office do not want to play down the potential loss of 550 Honeywell jobs, but they say that the acquisition is part of a larger economic sorting out and that Morris County itself, with its large technology and manufacturing base, will not be hurt in the long run.</p>
        <p>The companies are not closing down, they point out, but merely reorganizing, sometimes leaving hundreds of jobs with the new, bigger company.</p>
        <p>The office space and manufacturing sites that some of the companies are leaving behind are quickly filled by other companies, they say, and employees of the merged companies have either relocated or found new jobs in the area.</p>
        <p>It is not, they insist, a sign of a downturn in Morris County's healthy economy, where corporate campuses have replaced the farms that used to dot this hilly, lush area about an hour's drive west of New York City.  The county's unemployment rate is less than 3 percent, lower than the state and national averages. It is home to 53 Fortune 500 companies, including Lucent Technologies and AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>''I just think these corporations are trying to consolidate to better their positions in the market,'' said Douglas Cabana, the Morris County freeholder director. ''A downturn would be companies losing profits and layoffs.''</p>
        <p>G.E., the network television and aircraft engine manufacturing giant based in Fairfield, Conn., expects to save money through the merger. But officials of G.E., which has 340,000 employees, said they did not yet know how many workers of its combined work force -- Honeywell has 120,000 employees -- might lose their jobs.</p>
        <p>''If people are laid off, the company will help them in every way they can to find new employment,'' said Tom Crane, a spokesman for Honeywell.</p>
        <p>''But clearly this is a good job market, particularly for highly skilled workers here.''</p>
        <p>Christopher Marra, executive director of the Morris Area Development Group, a private-public partnership for economic development, said the county had 230,000 private-sector jobs. The county has the second-highest inventory of office space and industrial space in New Jersey, with 23 million square feet, after Bergen County.</p>
        <p>''There has been a lot of activity in the sense of mergers and acquisitions in the last year, more than at any time since I came here in 1993-94,'' Mr. Marra said. ''But they're not fleeing the area.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marra said there had been no increase in the unemployment rate in the county in the last year, in spite of the recent mergers, an indication that workers at the newly merged companies who lived in the county either relocated or found jobs at the area's other companies.</p>
        <p>And space and land left behind by companies consolidating their operations are quickly gobbled up by others, he said.</p>
        <p>For example, when Exxon and Mobil merged in November, the new company declared as surplus a 473-acre complex in Florham Park that used to house Exxon's engineering division.</p>
        <p>This month, the Rockefeller Group Development Corporation of Manhattan agreed to buy the parcel, along Route 24 and Park Avenue, which it plans to develop into a $400 million office park with 2.2 million square feet of space.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cabana said Morris County would survive.</p>
        <p>''We all understand that corporate America is going through a restructuring,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Morris County has been fortunate for many years to be home to so many corporations because they understand the quality of life here is good and everybody seems to want to be here. That isn't going to change.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 25, 2000, Wednesday  An article yesterday about companies that have moved corporate headquarters out of Morris County, N.J., misstated the reason Schering-Plough pharmaceuticals moved to Kenilworth, in Union County. The company, which still has an office in Morris County, moved to a new, larger building in Kenilworth to improve corporate communications, a spokeswoman said. Schering-Plough did not merge with another company.</p>
