        <p>The board of AT&amp;T approved a plan to split up the company in what would be AT&amp;T's most significant overhaul since the court-supervised breakup of the company's Bell System in 1984.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, people close to the company said, AT&amp;T intends to spin off the company's cable television business and wireless units as separate companies over the next 12 to 24 months. The company also plans to create a new stock to track AT&amp;T's consumer long-distance division, which would operate as a separate retail unit. The remaining core of AT&amp;T would control most of the company's network and oversee the unit that serves business customers.</p>
