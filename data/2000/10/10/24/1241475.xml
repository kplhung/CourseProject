        <p>As Jon S.

        <p>As Jon S. Corzine continues to court elderly voters in minimalls and laborers in union halls across New Jersey, his Republican rival for the United States Senate, Representative Bob Franks, has been receiving glowing testimonials from his own most ardent supporters: Republicans from out of state.</p>
        <p>After appearing with former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York on Sunday, Mr. Franks campaigned today with Senators Don Nickles of Oklahoma and John W. Warner of Virginia in Warren County, where Mr. Franks trumpeted his vote for the so-called Social Security ''lock box'' at a retirement center.</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Franks appeared at a hastily arranged rally in Trenton with Gov. George E. Pataki of New York to receive the endorsement of a veterans' group. But just nine veterans appeared, and no more than a dozen Republican workers left their day jobs at the State House to hold ''Franks for Senate'' signs and clap at the few applause lines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki praised Mr. Franks for supporting increased federal financing for veterans' health care, then delivered what has become a routine attack on Mr. Corzine. ''Public office isn't for the elite,'' Mr. Pataki said. ''It isn't for those who can buy their way in. It's for those who work every day.''</p>
        <p>As much as Mr. Franks may welcome such statements, however, it is money for television commercials that he needs the most. And each of his visiting allies has provided an injection of cash in the last week: Mr. Pataki held a fund-raiser in New York on Wednesday that produced about $50,000 for Mr. Franks. Mr. Giuliani raised $50,000 on Sunday in Bay Head, and Mr. Dole brought in $30,000 in Rumson.</p>
        <p>Then, today, Senators Nickles and Warner raised about $35,000 over breakfast and lunch, said Laura Slomka, Mr. Franks's finance director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks trails Mr. Corzine by about 12 points in recent polls, but remains sanguine about his chances because Mr. Corzine has yet to break 50 percent in any survey. After attacking Mr. Corzine with what little money he had earlier on, Mr. Franks is now expected to begin running a positive commercial about himself in the next two days, in an effort to give voters an alternative to Mr. Corzine, one of Mr. Franks's advisers said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, meanwhile, spent what has become a typical day in his campaign, shaking hands with early-morning commuters at the New Jersey Transit station in Trenton, visiting elderly voters at a retirement center in Hamilton, then wooing medical workers at a hospital in Toms River, an event that was off-limits to journalists.</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Corzine campaigned at the Holiday City Mall in Berkeley Township, where a few dozen elderly patrons -- most of whom had ridden shuttle buses from nearby retirement complexes -- took time out from running errands, buying lottery tickets and socializing to hear Mr. Corzine speak.</p>
        <p>After shaking hands at the mall's beauty parlor, and doing a double-take at the sign outside a drugstore -- the Longevity Shop -- Mr. Corzine was led by an organizer to his waiting audience. He concentrated on the need for long-term care, saying he supported a $3,000 tax credit to help the elderly ''stay in their own homes.''</p>
        <p>Along the same lines, he said he favored allowing the elderly and disabled to draw down on their pensions and life insurance policies to pay for medical care at home, in nursing homes or in assisted-living centers. As if sensitive to Mr. Franks's charges that his programs would bankrupt the government, Mr. Corzine added, ''Not everything has to come from using the federal budget surplus.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine said he had a simple reason for speaking frequently to elderly citizens. ''Seniors are a high-voting, concentrated population, and we have to get to them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Later, in Atlantic City, Mr. Corzine addressed a gathering at a casino of 25 officials from 12 locals of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which was one of the first unions that endorsed his campaign in the Democratic primary.</p>
        <p>He appealed for help in getting out the vote. ''We've got to drag voters out and into the polling booths on Election Day,'' he said, adding that he looked forward to being ''partners with machinists, partners with labor, and partners with the people of New Jersey.''</p>
