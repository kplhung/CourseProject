        <p>Rafik Hariri, the owner of a billion-dollar construction and engineering company, was named prime minister tonight, as Lebanese hoped to see the battered country on the difficult road to recovery.</p>
        <p>President Emile Lahoud -- a Maronite Catholic, as is the convention in a nation where political power is strictly apportioned by religion -- was forced to appoint Mr. Hariri, an old political enemy, to the post, which is reserved for a Sunni Muslim, after Mr. Hariri and his supporters won a landslide victory in parliamentary voting in August.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Lahoud's opposition, Mr. Hariri had the support of an estimated 100 members of the 128-seat Parliament.</p>
        <p>The local politics are complicated.</p>
        <p>Lebanon operates largely under the control of Syria, which has claimed historical dominion since the Ottoman Empire and whose troops have been here, initially to protect the ruling Christians from the Palestinians and Muslims, since the beginning of the 1975-to-1990 civil war.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hariri had been prime minister from 1992 to 1998, during which time he began a vast rebuilding of the devastated Beirut business district and other ambitious projects. But his policies ran up extraordinary national debt, and there were charges by his opponents of cronyism and corruption.</p>
        <p>As the ailing Syrian leader, Hafez al-Assad, named his son, Bashar, as his heir in running Lebanon, Mr. Hariri fell out of favor. Mr. Lahoud, who had been the chief of the military, was named president in October 1998 and appointed Selim al-Hoss as prime minister in December. Mr. al-Hoss was widely respected for his integrity but had no political base.</p>
        <p>After Hafez al-Assad died in June, Bashar al-Assad took the reins in Syria and campaigned against Mr. Hariri, despite the fact that he was close to the Syrian intelligence units that had effectively ruled Lebanon for more than 10 years.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hariri ran a well-organized, well-financed campaign over the summer and overcame Mr. Lahoud's control of the national television station, which had constantly denigrated Mr. Hariri. As Mr. Hariri's campaign gained momentum, the new Syrian president took a more ambiguous position.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Hariri's victory was seen as a blow against the status quo, such is the extent of Syrian power here that his role essentially had to be ratified by Damascus. Indeed, all political players here have ties to Syria. Mr. Hariri met over the weekend with Maj. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, the longtime head of Syrian military intelligence in charge of Lebanon, and his local Lebanese delegate, Brig. Gen. Jamil Sayed, chief of the General Security Department, to confirm his appointment.</p>
