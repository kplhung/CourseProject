        <p>The World Series moves from the Bronx to Queens tonight, with the Mets playing host to Game 3 at Shea Stadium and looking for their first victory.</p>
        <p>But yesterday the players for both teams -- and of course their fans -- were still talking about an incident in the first inning of Game 2 on Sunday night. On a foul ball, the Yankee starter Roger Clemens picked up a broken piece of Mike Piazza's bat and threw it in the direction of Piazza, the Mets catcher. Tensions were already high because Clemens had beaned Piazza, the All-Star catcher, during a regular-season game in July. Despite the incident, Clemens and the Yankees went on to win, 6-5, and took a 2-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Piazza and his teammates expressed a range of emotions. Piazza was reserved, saying there was no simple way for the Mets to react to what Clemens called an accident.</p>

        <p>The World Series moves from the Bronx to Queens tonight, with the Mets playing host to Game 3 at Shea Stadium and looking for their first victory.</p>
        <p>But yesterday the players for both teams -- and of course their fans -- were still talking about an incident in the first inning of Game 2 on Sunday night. On a foul ball, the Yankee starter Roger Clemens picked up a broken piece of Mike Piazza's bat and threw it in the direction of Piazza, the Mets catcher. Tensions were already high because Clemens had beaned Piazza, the All-Star catcher, during a regular-season game in July. Despite the incident, Clemens and the Yankees went on to win, 6-5, and took a 2-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Piazza and his teammates expressed a range of emotions. Piazza was reserved, saying there was no simple way for the Mets to react to what Clemens called an accident.</p>
        <p>''We punch him, get guys thrown out, we're selfish,'' Piazza said. ''We back down, we're -- whatever, we look gutless. So what is there to say?''</p>
        <p>The Yankees continued to defend their pitcher, who reiterated he was overcome by emotion because of the World Series setting.</p>
        <p>Of course, Mets fans would hear none of that. But it seemed as if everyone on the street had a reaction whenever Clemens's name was mentioned.</p>
        <p>''Clemens humiliated New York,'' said one out-of-towner. ''He humiliated the sport. He humiliated the country.''</p>
        <p>But his performance helped the Yankees come within two victories of what would be their 26th World Series title. The veteran team, which has won 14 consecutive World Series games, is looking to win its third consecutive championship and fourth in five years.</p>
