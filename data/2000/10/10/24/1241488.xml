        <p>To prosecutors, Ryan Wagner is a would-be murderer. To two Mexican day laborers, he is the knife-wielding white man who took a turn beating them last month in an abandoned factory on Long Island.</p>
        <p>To his father, he is an alcoholic with deep anger and an impressionable follower -- whether of an ex-girlfriend who turned him into a fan of punk rock or of a well-known neighborhood racist who got him interested in white supremacy.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wagner, 19, says that whatever he was before he landed in jail here, today he is simply sorry.</p>
        <p>''I wish it never would have happened,'' Mr. Wagner said today, sitting in a visiting room of the Suffolk County Jail in Riverhead, 70 miles east of the two-family house in Maspeth, Queens, where he grew up with his parents. ''It was wrong. It should never have happened to nobody, no matter what color your skin is.''</p>
        <p>His eyes cast down for much of an hourlong talk with a reporter that was also attended by his parents and his lawyer, Thomas F. Liotti, Mr. Wagner, who is being held without bail, admitted that he took part in the Sept. 17 attack.</p>
        <p>The victims, Magdaleno Escamilla, 28, and Israel Perez, 19, were two of the Mexican day laborers who wait every day on Farmingville street corners for construction or landscaping jobs.</p>
        <p>The police say Mr. Wagner and another man, posing as contractors, picked up the two Mexicans and drove them to a deserted factory in Shirley, where Mr. Wagner and the other man hit Mr. Escamilla with a post hole digger and Mr. Wagner stabbed Mr. Perez in the shoulder and arm. The two Mexicans were hospitalized with serious injuries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner insisted today that while he had intended to beat the men with his fists, he used the knife only after one of the Mexicans hit him with a shovel -- a claim that contradicts the statement the victims gave to the police.</p>
        <p>His assertions were received skeptically by the authorities.</p>
        <p>''Right from the beginning, Wagner's is an after-the-fact rationalization,'' said the Suffolk District attorney, James M. Catterson Jr.</p>
        <p>The victims could not be reached for comment. After recovering from his injuries, Mr. Escamilla returned to Mexico.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner has been charged with attempted murder and aggravated harassment. He faces up to 50 years in prison if convicted.</p>
        <p>The other assailant is still at large. In the interview, Mr. Wagner said the man -- whom he described as a 28-year-old friend -- had proposed the attack.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner, his parents and his lawyer would identify the friend by his first name only, Christopher. But Detective Sgt. Robert Reecks, commanding officer of the Bias Crimes Unit of the Suffolk police, said Mr. Wagner had provided police with the man's full name and was cooperating in the investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner, who worked most recently as a furniture deliveryman -- said that the night before the beatings, he had roamed Manhattan, drinking beer and whiskey and taking LSD. Returning home, he said, he called Christopher.</p>
        <p>''I was drunk and angry,'' Mr. Wagner said. ''When I drink, I get angry at the world.''</p>
        <p>He said Christopher had suggested that Mr. Wagner drive out to Suffolk County, where Christopher was living, to beat up some Mexicans.</p>
        <p>Asked why he wanted to beat them, Mr. Wagner replied: ''I don't know, I just wasn't thinking straight. I never would have done this if I was sober. I just had so much anger inside me, I guess I thought if I beat somebody up, it would make me feel better.''</p>
        <p>The incident has made Mr. Wagner an emblem of racial hatred on Long Island, and especially in Farmingville, a Suffolk County hamlet of 15,000 residents that was already simmering with racial tensions before last month's attack.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner said that he had once espoused racist views and that in the summer of 1999 he attended a rally of white supremacists in Pennsylvania. Among his 18 tattoos are swastikas and other white supremacist symbols.</p>
        <p>His main problems, he said, are alcohol and anger. His parents first arranged psychological counseling for him when he was in fifth grade and was subject to outbursts of rage, he said. Five years later, he dropped out of high school.</p>
        <p>Mr. Catterson, the Suffolk district attorney, said Mr. Wagner's attempt to blame the attack on alcohol or drug abuse was a well-worn strategy. Juries, he said, are ''tired of the abuse excuse.''</p>
        <p>And even if Mr. Wagner's friend had proposed the beatings, he said, Mr. Wagner ''could have said: 'No, I am not going.' Or if he got there, he could have chosen not to participate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner said his anger was heightened by a succession of bad news a year ago.</p>
        <p>Last November, Dennis and Arleen Wagner, both 44, told their two children -- Ryan and a younger sister -- that they planned to divorce after 20 years of marriage. About a month later, Mrs. Wagner's mother died of breast cancer.</p>
        <p>''I think he got a one-two punch at that time and was very angry,'' said Dennis Wagner, an occupational therapist at a Bronx nursing home.</p>
        <p>He and Mrs. Wagner, an aide at a Queens high school, said they were aware of their son's fascination with white-supremacist views, but thought he had abandoned those ideas after his grandmother died.</p>
        <p>Today, Ryan Wagner says he hopes to get rid of his racist tattoos. He denounces white supremacy. And he says he wants to rein in his temper.</p>
        <p>Dennis Wagner says his son can still be rehabilitated.</p>
        <p>''It is not too late to turn himself around and make himself a good member of society,'' he said. ''I wish something else could have woke him up.''</p>
