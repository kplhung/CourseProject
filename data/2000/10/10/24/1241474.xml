        <p>When Peter Fenn became a media political consultant 20 years ago, he said he was motivated more by a love of politics than a love of money.</p>
        <p>But he got both. Mr. Fenn's gold-plated client list now includes Vice President Al Gore, leaders of Congress, heads of state and deep-pocketed interest groups. He just moved into fancy new Washington offices, and he counsels students at nearby George Washington University that while he is ''not one of the folks with yachts and houses in six different places,'' political consulting can pay off intellectually -- and financially.</p>
        <p>No more so than right now. With fund-raising records being shattered and with airwaves flooded with advertisements from candidates and interest groups, the November election is turning into a bonanza for political consultants. For all the hand-wringing about the high cost of politics, one group has little reason to complain: the pollsters, media buyers, television stations, direct mail houses, Web masters and telemarketers receiving all this money.</p>
        <p>''It's coming down in buckets,'' said Phil Noble, president of Politics OnLine, an Internet firm.</p>
        <p>Political consultants are more accustomed to toiling for low wages on shoestring campaigns and supplementing campaign work with other jobs. But this year, some consultants say their revenues have doubled since the last election, and others say consultants on big national campaigns will see million-dollar paychecks. ''Winner's bonuses'' of $20,000 to $30,000 are being offered to some consultants on top of their regular fees if their candidate wins.</p>
        <p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the number of political consultants has tripled in 10 years, according to Political Resources, the trade directory.</p>
        <p>On television, political commercials are creating a windfall for broadcasters, according to a report by the brokerage firm Paine Webber, which estimates that a record $1 billion will be spent on political commercials -- $350 million more than the firm estimated just a few months ago. Politics now ranks No. 3 in overall commercials after autos and retailing.</p>
        <p>''Whatever office, whatever level of government, candidates are spending serious money on campaigns,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. ''And it winds up going to these consultants. These guys are like systems analysts in a software company -- they are in the right place at the right time, and an awful lot of them will get wealthy in this election.''</p>
        <p>Technology and money have combined to create opportunities for political consultants that never existed before. For instance, Hank Sheinkopf, a pollster in the last Clinton campaign, has found that even a county commissioner candidate in Indiana can afford to hire him. And there are whole new lines of business. For instance, telemarketers, like Winning Connections, based in Washington, tap into computer data banks to call 500,000 targeted voters in three days. Or people like Michael Connell, manager of the Bush campaign Internet strategy, represent new types of consulting.</p>
        <p>Much attention is focused, of course, on the presidential campaign and high-profile races like the one between Representative Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton. But the universe of potential clients is much larger. There are 513,200 elected offices in the United States, from senator to sheriff. While it is difficult to determine how many offices are up for grabs this November, Campaigns and Elections, a trade publication, estimates that $14 billion will be spent in the current four-year election cycle by candidates, parties and interest groups.</p>
        <p>For the most part, political consultants are generally paid a flat fee by the campaign, although payments to media buyers can vary with the amount of advertisements placed.</p>
        <p>''The system is awash in money,'' said Gary Nordlinger, who heads a media consulting firm he founded 25 years ago. ''Political parties are spending more, the soft money is stunning, and it doesn't stop there. You have all these interest groups spending money -- pro-choice, right-to-life, business groups and unions. Television stations are laughing all the way to the bank.''</p>
        <p>The growth in spending is coming about for many reasons. Campaign contributions are breaking all records, an offshoot of a good economy and a breakdown in campaign finance laws, causing a political inflation to set in. For instance, in 1996, a hot Congressional race might cost around $500,000; by 1998, it jumped to $800,000 or more.</p>
        <p>Now, candidates in hot Congressional races are spending $1 million, with soft-dollar spending from parties and interest groups adding $1 million to $2 million more to the per-candidate tab, consultants say. As of last June 30, Congressional candidates raised $653 million, according to the Federal Election Commission. And that number does not include the even greater dollars being spent on Congressional races by the parties and interest groups.</p>
        <p>''Why is it different?'' said Joseph Napolitan, a political consultant on more than 100 federal campaigns. ''It's because people are finding more loopholes in campaign finance laws than you find in a piece of Swiss cheese, and they are just driving through them. The hundreds of millions raised through soft money and by interest groups are providing work for people in my business.''</p>
        <p>In the presidential race, Mr. Gore and Gov. George W. Bush each have $67.56 million in federal campaign matching funds -- as well as $298 million total in soft dollars from the two parties. In last spring's presidential primaries the top 13 candidates spent a total of $446.4 million.</p>
        <p>Then there are state ballot proposals which, in states like California,  can create enough business to support a cottage industry of consultants. A total of $150 million was spent on 20 California ballot proposals last March, and the same amount is expected to be spent this November. Big growth areas for consultants are campaigns by various interest groups, like the A.F.L.-C.I.O. From a consultant's perspective, issue work has the advantage of not having a candidate to deal with.</p>
        <p>''You don't have candidates yelling at you because their wife said you made them look goofy,'' Mr. Noble, of Politics OnLine, said. ''For consultants, this is low maintenance, high price tag.''</p>
        <p>New technologies, too, have made campaigns more scientific, more sophisticated and, of course, more costly. Web masters never existed before; now they are a campaign staple. Computer databases enable direct-mail houses and telemarketers to identify voters by sex, voting frequency, income and age. Once polls took several days to tally. Now they are instantaneous, increasing the appetite for more.</p>
        <p>''Campaigns are like arms races,'' said Trevor Potter, a Washington  lawyer and former Federal Election commissioner. ''You didn't know you needed another battleship until the other country had one.''</p>
        <p>Nowhere is this more evident than  in local and statehouse races.</p>
        <p>''What's really changed is the down-ballot stuff,'' said James Spencer, a director of Winning Directions, a San Francisco direct-mail company that will send out 44 million pieces of campaign mail. ''It's driven by competition. Your opponent will use all the professional tools. If you don't use those tools, you won't have a prayer.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, $1.4 billion was spent on statehouse races, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which expects that number to be easily exceeded this year. It costs $75,000 for an average state Senate race -- rising to $600,000 in California or $400,000 in Texas -- and $30,000 for a statehouse race, rising  to $200,000 in other states.</p>
        <p>Take Iowa, where Jamie Van Fossen, a Republican state legislator is running for re-election. His first campaign in 1994 was a grass-roots effort manned by volunteers addressing mailings from his basement.</p>
        <p>This time, he has a budget of $50,000 and a more sophisticated plan: sending out direct mailings to voters picked by a computer. He has scheduled a first round of polls and may follow it up with tracking polls, and he has three commercials set to run on CNBC and CNN.</p>
        <p>''The more competitive the race,'' Mr. Van Fossen said, ''the more you need to do.''</p>
        <p>It is almost a rule of thumb that television consumes about half a candidate's budget -- from the presidency on down. And with media consultants getting a percentage of the costs of every advertisement they place -- 5 percent to 15 percent of the advertisement buy -- rising media costs mean rising consultant's pay.</p>
        <p>''There are layers of greed everywhere,'' said Mr. Makinson, of the Center for Responsive Politics. ''Political consultants are putting pressure on candidates to raise money to pay their bills.''</p>
        <p>But media consultants point the finger at broadcasters who are raising rates as the election draws near. Federal law requires that candidates get lower rates than commercial advertisers, but even this preferential rate is rising in the last weeks of the campaign. Moreover, commercials from the growing number of interest groups are charged top-dollar prices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fenn, the media consultant, said one West Coast interest group that paid $900 for a spot during the 11 p.m. news in September is now being charged $2,000; another that paid $600 for a slot on the Sunday 11 p.m. news last month is being charged $1,800. This has left Mr. Fenn fuming.</p>
        <p>''The campaign has become the Mercedes protection program for television stations,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Because of such rising costs, even  Mr. Napolitan, the veteran consultant, says he scratches his head -- especially in Congressional races.</p>
        <p>''I don't understand why someone would spent $2 million to get elected to a $125,000 a year job,'' he said. ''But they do it all the time.''</p>
