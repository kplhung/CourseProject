        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I can give several reasons why United States churches have been slow to apply for federal money in order to give more assistance to the poor (news article, Oct. 17).</p>
        <p>Many church people think they should not be expected to pick up the slack for a government whose policies on education, health care, welfare, day care and other issues have insufficiently addressed poverty in this rich country. There is also real distrust in the churches about whether the money that would come would be sufficient to provide for the needed staff and services.</p>
        <p>Last, the energy and time required to start new programs would divert our attention from direct advocacy on the structural inequities that perpetuate poverty. For two millenniums, churches have given help to the poor with the understanding that it is a fundamental part of our religious practice but that religious work for justice should not be appropriated or distracted.</p>
