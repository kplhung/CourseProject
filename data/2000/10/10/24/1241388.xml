        <p>Although he joked about it during his Twilight Singers' show last Tuesday at the Bowery Ballroom, there will never be a VH-1 ''Behind the Music'' episode about Greg Dulli.</p>
        <p>The 35-year-old frontman of the Afghan Whigs and now of this side project has lived the show's typical arc: early notoriety as a postpunk sex symbol, mounting fame mirrored by increasing self-indulgence, commercial decline coupled with personal disaster (in Mr. Dulli's case, a severe head injury in a 1996 bar brawl), and finally self-awareness and a renewed artistic vision. The only thing missing is the key in the corporate music world: Mr. Dulli has never had a Top 10 hit.</p>

        <p>Although he joked about it during his Twilight Singers' show last Tuesday at the Bowery Ballroom, there will never be a VH-1 ''Behind the Music'' episode about Greg Dulli.</p>
        <p>The 35-year-old frontman of the Afghan Whigs and now of this side project has lived the show's typical arc: early notoriety as a postpunk sex symbol, mounting fame mirrored by increasing self-indulgence, commercial decline coupled with personal disaster (in Mr. Dulli's case, a severe head injury in a 1996 bar brawl), and finally self-awareness and a renewed artistic vision. The only thing missing is the key in the corporate music world: Mr. Dulli has never had a Top 10 hit.</p>
        <p>Suspension at the cult level makes this gifted experimenter's story emblematic in a different way, revealing how commercial pressure hurts artists better matched with a self-selected audience. Mr. Dulli's soul-influenced rock is the product of an obsessive mind pondering the fire walls of race and sex, where stereotypes entice and mislead. When it works, his songs are disturbing seductions; when he tries too hard, they resemble a clumsy pass.</p>
        <p>The new album ''Twilight . . . as Played by the Twilight Singers'' (Columbia) is Mr. Dulli's most introverted work in years, and its relative coolness serves his themes. This moody music was conceived as a counterpart to the Whigs' punk-tinged attacks and a way for Mr. Dulli, not a vocal maestro, to increase his range by fully collaborating with his friends and fellow vocalists Harold Chichester and Shawn Smith. Mr. Dulli also enlisted Fila Brazillia, an English duo, to add an electronic groove, completing his multitiered portrait of a lover's anti-heroic journey. The record is as ambitious, if hardly as splashily difficult, as Radiohead's ''Kid A.''</p>
        <p>At the Bowery Ballroom, Mr. Dulli was uncharacteristically subdued, splitting the spotlight with Mr. Chichester. (Mr. Smith was not present.) The two singers blended their disparate voices as only longtime drinking buddies can; Mr. Dulli stepped back from his rough howl to make room for his pal's gentler assertions. The third main player in this seven-piece band was the guitarist Kyle Ellison, who particularly shone on slide, adding another layer of attractive ooze.</p>
        <p>The band gave ''Twilight's'' melancholy tracks a harder bedrock, allowing Mr. Dulli to satisfy his urge for catharsis. Yet the almost cartoonish flamboyance of the Whigs' most recent tour was gone. As always, the singer led the band into snippets of hits, including Madonna's latest single, a Marvin Gaye classic and one of the Folkways recordings Moby sampled on his album ''Play.''  Mostly, though, this was Mr. Dulli's chance to return to his private fixations, which, when fleshed out so artfully, prove as far-reaching as they need to be.</p>
