        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Clemens Throws a Bat, Then Dominates the Mets'' (front page, Oct. 23): As an avid Yankee fan, I enthusiastically sat down to watch Game 2 of the Subway Series. I was horrified when Roger Clemens, the Yankees' pitcher, threw a bat at the Mets' Mike Piazza. I was dumbfounded when Clemens was not ejected from the game, and found myself in the uncomfortable position of rooting for the Yankees and against Clemens.</p>

        <p>Re ''Clemens Throws a Bat, Then Dominates the Mets'' (front page, Oct. 23): As an avid Yankee fan, I enthusiastically sat down to watch Game 2 of the Subway Series. I was horrified when Roger Clemens, the Yankees' pitcher, threw a bat at the Mets' Mike Piazza. I was dumbfounded when Clemens was not ejected from the game, and found myself in the uncomfortable position of rooting for the Yankees and against Clemens.</p>
        <p>When I arrived at work today at an alternative junior high school on the Lower East Side, I found the students excitedly discussing Clemens's behavior. As a social worker, I work with children on many issues, including anger management. We teach our students that if you retaliate, you are equally guilty -- of fighting, of throwing crayons and so on. We help our students find words to express their feelings.</p>
        <p>So why is a future Hall of Fame pitcher allowed to instigate a fight on the biggest baseball stage without any consequences?</p>
