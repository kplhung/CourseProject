        <p>Metropolitan Life, which owns and operates Peter Cooper Village, is seeking a rent increase for major rewiring of the 2,480 units in the sprawling complex east of First Avenue between 20th and 23rd Streets. Some tenants, many of them elderly, long-term residents on limited incomes, say they cannot afford the monthly increase that Met Life wants, which will amount fo $44 per room.</p>
        <p>The company, meanwhile, says it is within its rights. Met Life officials say that unlike Stuyvesant Town, its sister development to the south, Peter Cooper Village was never intended as moderate-income housing.</p>
        <p>The company received a 25-year tax abatement in return for a limit on its profits at Stuyvesant Town, but there was no such arrangement at Peter Cooper Village, which had larger apartments for families.</p>
        <p>That is small comfort for Peter Cooper's tenants.</p>
        <p>''My husband fought in World War II, and he got this apartment as part of the benefits for returning vets,'' said Soni Fink, who continued the rent-stabilized lease on her one-bedroom apartment after her husband's death. ''And now, this is the thanks we get.'' She said the $132-per-month increase, coupled with a 6 percent rise when her two-year lease is renewed this fall, would increase her total rent by nearly half.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Steven Sanders, who lives in the development, said Met Life had already received permission for several rent increases for capital improvements at Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town.</p>
        <p>But he opposes the current application, which is to be decided soon by the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal. ''The company is doing this because, when the rent reaches $2,000, apartments become destabilized,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A Met Life spokesman, John Calanga, denied that accusation. ''We are talking about a building that hasn't had a wiring upgrade in 50 years,'' he said. ''It has fuses instead of circuit breakers. The law allows owners of a building to pass along these costs to tenants.'' And, he added, the apartments in the complex ''were never intended to fall under the umbrella of affordable housing.''</p>

        <p>NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST SIDE  Correction:  August 13, 2000, Sunday  An article in the Neighborhood Report pages on July 30 about proposed rent increases in Peter Cooper Village misattributed a quotation from a critic of the increases. It was not Soni Fink but another Peter Cooper resident, unidentified, who said: ''My husband fought in World War II, and he got this apartment as part of the benefits for returning vets. And now this is the thanks we get.'' The article also misstated the percentage by which Ms. Fink's rent would rise. It would be 22 percent, plus standard lease renewal increases, not ''nearly half.''</p>
