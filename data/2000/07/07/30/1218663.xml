        <p>CONTEMPORARY wood turning turns adventurous when artists are challenged to create work symbolizing personal exploration and artistic growth.</p>
        <p>In ''Horizons 2000: Artist Woodturners,'' at the Lynn Tendler Bignell Exhibition Gallery of the Brookfield Craft Center through Aug. 16, the concept invites wide interpretation, from classic to kitsch to reaching-for-the-stars spiritual.</p>
        <p>''Over the years wood turning has evolved from a focus of making vessels on the lathe to making art using the lathe,'' said John I. Russell, executive director of the Brookfield Craft Center. ''And that is what is at the heart of this show.''</p>
        <p>Woodturners now manipulate pieces on the lathe; then they carve, cut, scorch, paint and sometimes use it as part of a grander construction. Wood turning, in fact, was once a fairly perfunctory trade taught in industrial art classes in high school.</p>
        <p>''In the last few decades, wood turning began a process of evolution,'' Mr. Russell said. ''The shape of the vessel became important as sculpture and exotic woods were used including burls, a growth on a tree and unusual piece of wood difficult to work with because it shatters easily. Woodturners began experimenting with nontraditional materials and processes.''</p>
        <p>The curator, David Ellsworth, an artist whose classic, minimalist hollow vessels eulogizing grain are collected by the Renwick Gallery, the White House and the American Craft Museum, invited 30 American and 8 foreign woodturners to contribute to the show.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to present the breadth of the field as it is today, in particular the balance between the intimacy of small identifiable objects and pure sculptural forms,'' Mr. Ellsworth said. ''And in addition to known woodturners I wanted to include people who are young in the field, who don't often get the recognition they should.</p>
        <p>Some of the more delicate objects are housed in glass environments for easy viewing, others are displayed like sculptures on pedestals, inviting viewers to walk around to explore their variations.</p>
        <p>The artists' personal statements and narratives are part of the installation, as is the element of surprise.</p>
        <p>Norris White, a retired carpenter, offers the hit of the show: a leather-soft looking baseball glove and ball that turn out to be hollow, but stitched together just like the real thing. Mark Nantz, a 31-year-old self-taught woodturner, attributes ''Black Hole,'' suggestive of a machine-like object from outer space, to experimentation with cabinet making, box making, knife making and model making.</p>
        <p>In this woodturner's temporary paradise, each object stands in stark contrast to the others: Gary Stevens's seashell-shaped ''Redwood Lace'' made of burl with voids and flame-like shadings; Robyn Horn's ''Pierced Monostone,'' a sculpture with just a tease of turning; Dewey Garrett's ''Maroon Palm No. 2,'' a vibrant red hair-like surface some say is reminiscent of an African ceremonial vessel. And both Christian Berchard's ''Black Gourds'' and Richard Tuttle's ''Six Pack'' are realistic and haunting.</p>
        <p>''We are working at wood turning from a broad dynamic and also as poetry,'' Mr. Ellsworth said.</p>
        <p>''The object,'' he added, ''is to transcend the craft and open the viewer to what art and woodturning can be.''</p>
        <p>The Lynn Tendler Bignell Gallery at the Brookfield Craft Center, 286 Whisconier Road, Route 25 in Brookfield, is open Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m.</p>
        <p>The number to call for further information is (203) 775-4526.</p>
