        <p>Handbag lovers who keep up with the trends have a heavy must-have list this fall. You can't carry a black and silver purse with next season's brown tweeds. And that satin Gucci clutch with the gold chain strap certainly does not go with autumn's Manolo herringbone stilettos. To accommodate the overextended fashionista, the latest accessories innovation is handbags with detachable handles. Givenchy offers the Charade bag, far right, named after a style Audrey Hepburn had in the 1963 film of that name. The rectangular purse, available in black or polished calf for $760, has eight handles. Purchased separately, they include a pony skin strap with a graphic print, $180, and a Swarovski-crystal-encrusted one, $500. Searle offers a less pricey transformable pocketbook called Bag du Jour, left, in denim with python or ostrich trimmings, and in beachy canvas. The bag, with no handle, costs $48, or $68 for the tote size. Leather handles, $55 each, come in brown, green, red, lavender, blue and six other shades, and they clasp through holes in the top with a fishing-style hook. What's next? Shoes with removable heels? One can only hope.</p>
