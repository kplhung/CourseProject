      <block class="full_text">
        <p>YOU was my brother Charley, you should have looked out for me a little bit. . . . You don't understand! I could have had class. I could have been a contender.''</p>
        <p>Marlon Brando made those words famous in Elia Kazan's 1954 classic, ''On The Waterfront.'' Written by Budd Schulberg, the controversial, Academy Award-winning film concerned the problems of trade unionism and racketeering on New York's gritty waterfront docks.</p>
        <p>Forty-six years later, in the same place where much of the movie was filmed, including the scene where a bloodied Terry Malloy (played by Mr. Brando) regains his self-respect -- and in the presence of a priest and the woman he loves, cleanses his conscience by confronting the corrupt union leader, Johnny Friendly -- those memorable lines will be spoken again.</p>
        <p>This Thursday in Hoboken, Mr. Schulberg, 86, will be one of many watching a theatrical staged reading of ''On the Waterfront.'' The one-night event, which begins at 7 p.m. and is free to the public, features Vincent Pastore, who played Sal (Big Pussy) Bompensiero on the HBO series ''The Sopranos,'' in the role of Charley Malloy.</p>
        <p>The reading will take place at Frank Sinatra Park Amphitheater on Frank Sinatra Drive between Fourth and Fifth Streets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pastore, whose wise-guy character on ''The Sopranos'' was shot to death at sea in the season finale, has been living in California working on a number of other film projects, but he is as honored as he is anxious to spend a night on those docks.</p>
        <p>''This was one of my all-time favorite movies, right up their with 'Raging Bull' and 'Shane,' '' Mr. Pastore said. ''I'm 54 years old, so you know I'm a Brando guy and James Dean guy all the way.''</p>
        <p>In 1988, Mr. Schulberg, who also wrote such mid-50's classics as ''Face in The Crowd'' with Andy Griffith and ''The Harder They Fall,'' Humphrey Bogart's last movie, turned his famous screenplay into pure theater, and ''On the Waterfront'' made its debut at the Cleveland Playhouse to rave reviews.</p>
        <p>In 1993, the Renegade Theater Company brought the play home to Hoboken. Riding the crest of the play's popularity, Mr. Pastore and the rest of the original cast took their act Off-Broadway, and the play enjoyed a successful five-week run on Theater Row. Two years later, the show went to Broadway, and all of the original actors, including Mr. Pastore, were replaced in favor of better-known performers.</p>
        <p>It bombed.</p>
        <p>''Once it got to Broadway, it lost all control,'' said Mr. Schulberg, who lives on Long Island, and is recovering from heart bypass surgery he had in May. ''The 'Waterfront' that cost $30,000 to produce was beautifully organized, and the one that cost $500,000 was a shambles.</p>
        <p>''The actors were O.K., but the people directing the performances were inexperienced, and they gave the actors too much freedom and not enough direction,'' Mr. Schulberg said. ''And when that happens, and I've seen it happen my whole life, actors tend to run amok.''</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Pastore and Mr. Schulberg are hoping that Thursday night's performance, which will feature other members of the original production, can get ''On the Waterfront'' back where it belongs.</p>
        <p>''We always thought that this was an Off-Broadway piece, not the kind of production that's going to fill 2,000 seats a night,'' Mr. Pastore said. ''So one of our goals in doing this reading is to have people see us again, and for them to like it enough to get it back Off-Broadway, on 42nd Street, or somewhere in that vicinity.''</p>
        <p>On the Tuesday before the big night, Mr. Schulberg will be in Hoboken to lend a hand during rehearsals.</p>
        <p>''I'll be at the early reading,'' Mr. Schulberg said. ''I'll talk over what I see with the casting director, and maybe make some minor cuts in the script.''</p>
        <p>Having industry icons like Mr. Schulberg around the stage or movie set is awe-inspiring, said Mr. Pastore, who peeked into the audience one night during a performance of ''On the Waterfront'' on Theater Row, and saw his father sitting next to Mr. Kazan, whose resume includes classics like ''Face in the Crowd,'' ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and ''East of Eden.''</p>
        <p>''Men like Mr. Schulberg and Mr. Kazan, these men are legends,'' Mr. Pastore said. ''And of course, I loved Brando. He came before Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, he was the ultimate method actor.''</p>
        <p>''Growing up, you see a movie like 'Waterfront,' and you never think that one day you'll be playing these roles,'' Mr. Pastore added. ''Come Thursday, people are going to have a great night, especially Mr. Schulberg, because in the end, this is a tribute to him.''</p>
