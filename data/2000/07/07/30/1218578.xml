      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>As a major-league team psychologist for 12 years, I concur with Buster Olney's characterization of the interactions between pitchers and position players (July 9). Allegiance to identity groups is a reality in baseball as well as in other professional sports. However, baseball teams with talent, a sound organizational plan and effective leadership learn to work together on the field. Other sectors of American society (e.g., sales versus service; engineering versus production; administration versus teaching) can benefit from the study of the clubhouse of a successful major-league team.</p>
