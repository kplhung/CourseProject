        <p>SO closely is the late Bill Monroe identified with his musical creation, bluegrass, that it's almost as if man and music called each other into being. The notion of a pre-Monroe bluegrass obviously makes no sense, yet it's almost as hard to imagine a pre-bluegrass Monroe. What? Without his big white Stetson? Without the Blue Grass Boys, deployed in their immutable formula of guitar, banjo, fiddle and bass? It's like trying to picture Bob Wills without a western swing band.</p>
        <p>So to bluegrass fans who haven't probed country-music history -- indeed, to anyone aware of Monroe's stature as one of America's few founders of a musical genre -- the newly issued CD ''What Would You Give in Exchange for Your Soul?'' (Rounder 1073) packs a powerful surprise. The first in an eventual four-CD series, it contains 15 of the 60 songs Bill Monroe recorded as the mandolinist, harmony vocalist and junior partner in the Monroe Brothers, a red-hot duo that scorched the Carolinas in the mid-30's. In 1936, Bill, 25, and his lead-singing, guitar-picking brother Charlie, 33, released their first record, the song that gives this CD its name. ''What Would You Give in Exchange for Your Soul?'' became one of the biggest country-music hits of the 30's, popular throughout the South. A decade before he presided over the birth of bluegrass, Bill Monroe was already a star.</p>

A decade before he presided over the birth of bluegrass, Bill Monroe was already a star.</p>
        <p>Over the years, a few anthologies have offered tantalizing glimpses of the Monroe Brothers, and a two-LP set, long extinct, came out in 1975. For the most part, the Monroes' music has remained a rumor, unavailable in the United States. When Rounder's collection is fully released -- the remaining CD's will appear this fall and next year -- one of the high points of early country music will no longer be a secret.</p>
        <p>The 30's ushered in a new kind of hillbilly recording artist (until about 1950, country music was known by the disparaging near-epithet ''hillbilly''). Unlike their forebears -- casual pickers for whom record-making had been a lark -- the new breed were full-time, self-proclaimed entertainers, young, polished and ambitious. Steeped in tradition, they were also impatient with it. Members of the first generation to grow up on radio and records, they were eager to incorporate the sounds of modernity, of jazz bands and smooth pop crooners, into their music. Charlie and Bill Monroe's sound matched their beautifully tailored suits; a streamlined whoosh, it brought intimations of big-city speed and excitement to their rural audiences. The Monroes' relationship to country music parallels that of Bill's exact contemporary Robert Johnson, with his self-aware professionalism, supercharged technique and nervous intensity, to the blues of the Mississippi Delta. Like Johnson, the Monroe Brothers prodded a rural idiom out of a sleepy past into a hardboiled, hopped-up present.</p>
        <p>By the time Bill and Charlie came to record, they had kicked around plenty. Native Kentuckians, they had busted their backs in an oil refinery outside Chicago and barnstormed the Midwest with their brother Birch, who left the group in 1934. Heading south in 1935, Bill and Charlie worked the North Carolina-South Carolina line; radio performers by day, by night they rode the bad roads to schoolhouses, churches, town halls: any place big enough to hold a crowd.</p>
        <p>Big Charlie was the frontman, a gregarious crowd pleaser, but it was the sounds Bill wrenched from his mandolin -- an absurdly unlikely vehicle for heroics -- that distinguished the Monroes from every other hillbilly act. Before Bill Monroe, the mandolin was an inessential instrument in country music, a prop you gave the singer so he could do something with his hands. Out of sheer stubbornness and, as it happened, something like genius, Monroe invented something like a language for it, made it a blistering solo instrument. Moving his pick rapidly up and down across the strings, he was able to play double- and quadruple-time runs, and when the tempo was as fast to begin with as it was on ''Watermelon Hangin' on That Vine'' or ''New River Train,'' Bill's 16th-note runs drove people half-wild, made them jump out of their seats, throw their hats in the air, stamp their shoes, holler like crazy fools.</p>
        <p>Charlie used the pick-strum style he'd no doubt learned from Carter Family records, but Maybelle Carter never played this fast. Charlie Monroe must have been a powerful man, to whip his right wrist up and down on the strings as speedily and relentlessly as he did yet with enough finesse to pick out lickety-split little bass runs. The first Monroe Brothers song I ever heard (the title escapes me) was one of the fast ones. As the guitar-mandolin intro came on, I grumbled to myself: somebody had sped up the turntable (yes, this was back in the LP days). But in came the voices, relaxed and resonant. Nobody had fooled with the turntable;  this was merely a case of next-to-impossible musicianship. To this day, whenever I feel like laughing out loud with the giddy pleasure of hearing something ridiculously difficult pulled off with nonchalant aplomb, I listen to the Monroe Brothers playing fast.</p>
        <p>But Bill and Charlie weren't merely speedsters. When the Monroe Brothers played religious songs, which they considered their stock in trade, they slowed the tempo way down, shifting the emphasis to their closely harmonizing voices. ''What Would You Give in Exchange for Your Soul?'' was slow and bone-sparse; unflashily played, it sails aloft on the brothers' voices -- Bill's especially, an eerie falsetto moan.</p>
        <p>Bill Monroe's voice and the Monroe Brothers' music in general have a bluesiness, a kinship with Southern black musical feeling, that's plainly audible in most early country music. While the Monroes are at their bluesiest in religious tunes -- a song like ''Do You Call That Religion?'' wouldn't have been out of place in a black prayer meeting -- their entire sound has a strong blues component. If I had to characterize the Monroes' music, I'd call it hillbilly soul: Southern white music deeply in touch with the black tradition.</p>
        <p>Bill and Charlie went their separate professional ways in 1938, but during their four short years together, they must have been something to see. ''The Monroe Brothers blow away anything Bill ever did on his own,'' said the guitarist and musicologist John Fahey recently. That's hyperbole, although it shows just how excited people still get over this music. Here's how I'd put it. Bill Monroe died in 1996, world-famous and full of honors. If, perish the thought, he'd died in 1938, he would still have affected the course of country music.</p>
