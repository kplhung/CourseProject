        <p>The best way to enjoy Evergreen Shanghai is to go with a big group so that you can sample more dishes.  The Shanghai cuisine at this restaurant is notable for the freshness of its ingredients. Appetizers include seaweed with garlic sauce; wine chicken; vegetable buns; smoked duck; jellyfish; subgum seafood soup; cold noodles with salty sour cabbage; sesame cold noodles; and fresh fried shrimp.

        <p>Grand Sichuan, a modest storefront establishment near the entrance to the Manhattan Bridge, may be one of a handful of real Sichuan restaurants in New York. Appetizers include Sichuan won ton with red oil; dumplings with pork and Chinese vegetables or chives; Sichuan cold noodles; and minced chicken and corn soup. Entrees include lobster with Sichuan sauce; prawns with garlic sauce; country chicken with ginger sauce; braised pork and chestnuts with brown sauce; spicy and sour squid; and sliced beef with spicy and wild pepper sauce.

        <p>Large families, lawyers and politicians share tables and advice about the food at this modest restaurant,  an offshoot of a restaurant of the same name in Flushing, Queens. Appetizers include crab meat with pork meat steamed bun; cold noodles with sesame sauce; Shanghai chives and shrimp with meat won ton in broth; and pork-fried, steamed or boiled dumplings. Entrees include crispy yellow fish fingers with dry seaweed; scallops and prawns with garlic sauce; shrimp noodle soup; shredded pork and dried bean curd with jalapeno pepper; Sichuan beef casserole; and eggplant with garlic sauce. (Review: 4/26/96)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK NOODLETOWN  **  [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 349-0923; 28 1/2 Bowery, at Bayard Street; $; no smoking; cash only.</p>
        <p>New York Noodletown, with its bustle and clatter, its shared tables and its chefs wreathed in billows of steam rising form the caldrons of soup in the front of the restaurant, is as close as you can get to Hong Kong without leaving Manhattan. Don't be fooled by the humble surroundings: this is an accomplished kitchen. Appetizers include pork and preserved egg porridge; shrimp dumpling and noodles in soup; and chicken and duck on rice. Entrees include shrimps with Hawaii nuts; fresh conch with sweet pea; chicken with lemon sauce; frog with yellow chives; mixed Cantonese sausage with taro casseroles; and boneless sea bass with vegetable. (Review: 6/ 3/94; article, 2/2/00)</p>
        <p>NHA TRANG  +  (212) 233-5948; 87 Baxter Street, between Canal and Bayard Streets; $; no smoking; cash only.</p>
        <p>You may have to jostle with hordes of jurors for the excellent Vietnamese food like steamed ravioli, rice noodle soups and chicken with lemon grass. Appetizers include beef satay with white rice; hot and sour shrimp soup; and chicken curry with egg noodles. Entrees include fried butterfly shrimp with hot, sweet and sour sauce; lobster fried with salt and pepper; beef with watercress in oyster sauce; chicken with black Chinese mushrooms; and frog legs with chili and lemongrass.
