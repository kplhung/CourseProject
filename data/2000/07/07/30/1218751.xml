        <p>Sometimes you give a party and no one comes, but in Wildwood, people tried to come to the Doo-Wop Festival and found it wasn't there.

        <p>Mike Porch, executive director of Main Street Wildwood, said his nonprofit organization for promoting the business district had sponsored and arranged the Doo-Wop Festival for the last four years.

        <p>Sometimes you give a party and no one comes, but in Wildwood, people tried to come to the Doo-Wop Festival and found it wasn't there.

        <p>Mike Porch, executive director of Main Street Wildwood, said his nonprofit organization for promoting the business district had sponsored and arranged the Doo-Wop Festival for the last four years. It had included lots of live music and at least one headliner, like Bobby Rydell (who recorded ''Wildwood Days'' in 1963), in addition to the usual shore festival food, games and souvenirs -- all designed to promote Wildwood's downtown area.</p>
        <p>Over the winter, Mr. Porch's group decided to cede the organization of the event to a tavern owner he declined to identify. ''He left town and it was too late to do anything,'' Mr. Porch said. ''These festivals take time to put together.''</p>
        <p>But the tourism calendars and Boardwalk placards that list summer events had already been printed. Officials said several hundred people came looking for the Doo-Wop Festival but none, as they could determine, were angered.</p>
        <p>''There is a lot to do in Wildwood, and I'm sure they found good entertainment here,'' said Mr. Porch, who noted that his group intended to produce the Blues Music Festival and Oktoberfest by the Sea, two other annual events along the Holly Beach Mall, the weekend of Aug. 26 and27.</p>
