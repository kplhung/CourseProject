        <p>ARE four spinoffs better than one whole company? That is the puzzle facing holders of Cabletron Systems.</p>
        <p>Once a highflier in computer networking, Cabletron lacks the size and vigor to compete across the board with the likes of Cisco Systems and Lucent Technologies. So it announced in February that it would split into four operating units and sell stakes of up to 20 percent in each to the public over the next 18 months, on the theory that four nimble baby Cabletrons would excite investors -- and potential acquirers -- more than the parent could.

        <p>ARE four spinoffs better than one whole company? That is the puzzle facing holders of Cabletron Systems.</p>
        <p>Once a highflier in computer networking, Cabletron lacks the size and vigor to compete across the board with the likes of Cisco Systems and Lucent Technologies. So it announced in February that it would split into four operating units and sell stakes of up to 20 percent in each to the public over the next 18 months, on the theory that four nimble baby Cabletrons would excite investors -- and potential acquirers -- more than the parent could. The company, based in Rochester, N.H., has also unloaded about $600 million in noncore assets in the revamping.</p>
        <p>''How do I take a company that is growing 4 to 6 percent year-over-year and transform it into one growing 30 percent a year?'' asked Piyush Patel, Cabletron's chairman and chief executive, in an interview. ''One of the things holding us back is I had one model peanut-buttered on four different businesses. They could not reach their highest potential.''</p>
        <p>At first, Wall Street was underwhelmed, and Cabletron's stock rode the technology downdraft harder than its peers, plummeting from $52 a share in early March to $18.625 in April. It has since rebounded to around $25, largely on the faith of Silver Lake Partners, a private equity firm in Menlo Park, Calif., that manages $2.3 billion in assets.</p>
        <p>Silver Lake has committed $90 million so far to Cabletron's four I.P.O.'s-in-waiting, and has bet on a rise in the parent's stock by buying warrants and convertible preferred shares. A Silver Lake partner, David Roux, is on Cabletron's board.</p>
        <p>''The parts are worth more than the whole,'' said Jim Davidson, co-founder of Silver Lake. He expects Cabletron stock to rise well above $50 a share.</p>
        <p>Cabletron has been acting like an incubator for a while, investing in some two dozen technology start-ups whose wireless and optical-networking products complement its own.  Mr. Patel's admiration for CMGI, a leading Internet incubator, is evident in Cabletron's planned post-spinoff ticker symbol, CSGI. (It is now CS.) While bigger rivals have been acquiring actively, Cabletron has piled up $1.6 billion in cash and no debt.</p>
        <p>The hottest property among the four imminent spinoffs is Riverstone Networks, which sells Internet routers and switches for large-scale networks, the kind that span whole cities. Analysts expect sales to double this year, reaching $50 million.</p>
        <p>Competitors like Foundry Networks, Juniper Networks and Redback Networks have been hot performers, and analysts who like the revamping plan say Riverstone ought to be valued highly when it comes to market in the fall. Others say they want to wait and see.</p>
        <p>Enterasys Networks, which sells routers and switches to large corporations, will be the biggest of the four, with $660 million in sales last year, and projected growth of 20 percent this year. The other two are much smaller but growing faster: GlobalNetwork Technology Services, which provides network management and security and is the second unit expected to come public this year, and Aprisma Management Technologies, specializing in infrastructure management software. Aprisma competes with Micromuse and Visual Networks, whose stock valuations are high.</p>
        <p>''They're throwing out as comparables very attractive category killers,'' said Megan Graham-Hackett of Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Group. ''These other highfliers have a lot of momentum. I'm just a little wary.''</p>
        <p>CABLETRON reported a loss of $37.9 million, or 21 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of $22.5 million, or 13 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue fell 21 percent, to $275.1 million, reflecting the asset sales. Mr. Patel said Cabletron would return to black ink by year-end.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, analysts say, the picture is less clear. ''If you take a look at their businesses, they are attractive, but aren't making money,'' Ms. Graham-Hackett said. ''The core business is a slower growth model,'' she said, and the small spinoffs may lack the heft to thrive on their own.</p>
