        <p>THE JONES BEACH HOTEL, almost three-quarters of a century old, is a local legend. Hidden away on a dead-end street in Wantagh, this spic and span spot has a restaurant that is remembered by generations of Long Islanders as everything from a modest eatery serving fixed-price Italian meals to a college hangout, to a teenage meeting and drinking rendezvous and, most recently, to a run-down bar. But never has it been what it is now, a place of unexpected luxury with easy-to-take prices and often commendable food.</p>
        <p>Per Un'Angelo, at 3275 Byron Street (516-783-6484), with its spiffy blue and white canopy, quaint white lamp posts and colorful marigold flower beds flanking the entrance, isn't easy to find. Tom Ulaj, who along with his partner, Elli Gjezo, presides over the dining room much as Toscanini did over a symphony orchestra, spends much of his time giving driving directions to diners.</p>

        <p>THE JONES BEACH HOTEL, almost three-quarters of a century old, is a local legend. Hidden away on a dead-end street in Wantagh, this spic and span spot has a restaurant that is remembered by generations of Long Islanders as everything from a modest eatery serving fixed-price Italian meals to a college hangout, to a teenage meeting and drinking rendezvous and, most recently, to a run-down bar. But never has it been what it is now, a place of unexpected luxury with easy-to-take prices and often commendable food.</p>
        <p>Per Un'Angelo, at 3275 Byron Street (516-783-6484), with its spiffy blue and white canopy, quaint white lamp posts and colorful marigold flower beds flanking the entrance, isn't easy to find. Tom Ulaj, who along with his partner, Elli Gjezo, presides over the dining room much as Toscanini did over a symphony orchestra, spends much of his time giving driving directions to diners.</p>
        <p>When they arrive at this 43-room residential hotel-with-a-history (it used to be on a bay until Cedar Creek Park was built on landfill), they find an elegant, traditional Italian restaurant. Sconce lighting illuminates columns, recessed spotlights shine down on white tablecloths with fresh flowers and wine bottle centerpieces.  A fireplace, in-wall wine racks, European art, cut glass, a tiny bar tucked into a woody niche and classical music mark Per Un'Angelo as a big-deal Italian restaurant.</p>
        <p>Yet only four of the menu's 23 entrees cost more than $20 (pasta main courses start at $11.95). Complimentary bruschetta precedes the meal and gratis melon and strawberries end it. The fruit was sweet and ripe, the bruschetta tasty, though it would have been better on more porous toast.</p>
        <p>Tomasso Aquinta, the chef, specializes not in cutting-edge surprises, but in splendid renditions of Italian classics with a few flourishes among the daily offerings. Typical is a standard-sounding hot antipasto for two ($14.95). Elsewhere, this is shrimp, clams, stuffed mushrooms, fried mozzarella and cheese-stuffed eggplant and often turns out to be an amalgam of motley morsels swimming in sauce and ranging in temperature from lukewarm to hot.  Here, diners receive tasty tidbits, artfully assembled and meticulously prepared. It is but one of a uniformly excellent array of appetizers. Others were a half-portion of fluffy, fine gnocchi ($5.95, $11.95 as an entree) in a rich and comforting pea-studded, meat-tomato sauce; an unusually bold and fresh fusilli primavera ($6.95 and $12.95) that stars gobs of garlic and a handful of crunchy vegetables; a small but superior arugula salad ($7.95) that is tossed with endive spears, olives and a rewarding olive oil-balsamic dressing; and a special of fresh figs and prosciutto ($8.95). The last, three halved figs under a blanket of firm, full-flavored prosciutto, was a simple, straightforward success.</p>
        <p>At entree time, the kitchen isn't quite as consistent. Two pastas suffered from under- and over-saucing.  A San Remo pasta special ($14.95) contained the promised shrimp, sun-dried tomatoes and arugula but was short on sauce -- and flavor. A calamari casserole ($13.95), atop linguine, boasted a pile of squid rings and a mountain of pasta, but was drowned in too much red sauce. Two jumbo pork chops ($16.95), smothered beneath a heap of vinegar-marinated red peppers, delivered hearty taste, but needed long, slow braising to soften and tenderize their lean meat.  A slab of swordfish ($21.95), napped in a delicate, delicious white wine, caper, diced tomato sauce, was given a dry, slightly chalky texture from over-cooking. Chicken scarpariello ($14.95) can mean meat on or off the bone, with or without sauce, sausages, onions or potatoes. Here it's basic, uncomplicated, crunchy nugget-size and on the bone. Not bad, but not interesting either. Sweet, melt-in-the-mouth bay scallops ($16.95) sauteed in a subtle white wine, pea, mushroom sauce, are a bull's-eye.</p>
        <p>Desserts ($4.95) batted .500. A standard, commercial bakery eclair and a moist, custardy but ho-hum Italian cheesecake were all right. Considerable better was a flaky light Napoleon and an airy, but firm cinnamon-topped creamy tiramisu.</p>
        <p>Per Un'Angelo is a relaxing place on a week night, but the noise wells up on weekends. At all times there is a warmth, ; much of it generated by Mr. Ulaj, a seasoned, sensitive pro.  When he offered our table a complimentary bottle of wine, I asked why, fearing I'd been discovered. He nodded to an adjacent table of boisterous diners. The wine was his way of saying, ''I'm sorry, I hope this will help.''</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>The Bay Leaf, a 160-seat Fire Island nouvelle American restaurant has replaced the Monster on Ocean Walk in Cherry Grove (631-597-4000). The neo-classic spot serves entrees in the $15 to $30 bracket and makes its own desserts. Among the dishes being prepared by Jimmy Smiley, the executive chef (from Schyular Meadows Country Club in Albany), and Scott Strimas, the sous chef (Commander's Palace, New Orleans), are Moroccan spiced tuna, lobster newburg pot pie, flourless chocolate torte with raspberry sauce and white chocolate cheesecake with a strawberry sauce.</p>
        <p>Stratta, a 55-seat Northern Italian restaurant at 1034 Broadway in Woodmere (516-792-0409), where Amber, a Russian nightclub had been, opened on May 27. It is owned by Miriam and John Zimmerman (the chef), who previously ran Goldberg's Gourmet Pizza and later the Buenas Aires Steak House in Manhattan. On-the-menu entrees are priced from $13.95 to $16.95, while nightly specials top out at $19.95.</p>
