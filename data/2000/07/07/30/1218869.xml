        <p>Queens Borough Historian Stanley Cogan letter praises July 2 article on Moore-Jackson Cemetery holds archaeologists in photograph should have been identified (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>My compliments on your July 2 article about the Moore-Jackson Cemetery (''A Hidden Cemetery of an Earlier Era Becomes More Visible).'' I was responsible for the landmarking of the cemetery and, as president of Queens Historical Society, am responsible for its restoration.</p>
        <p>But imagine if you were one of the archaeologists in the photograph. They are not identified as archaeologists and nowhere in the article is there any mention that the purpose of the dig is an archaeological one, for which they have been paid. The article says ''the Queens Historical Society oversaw a partial cleanup of that section in mid-June'' but its only purpose was archaeological, a first step in the total restoration of the cemetery.</p>

        <p>To say in the caption that the archaeologists were ''tending the cemetery'' is a misnomer and is a put-down of their work.</p>
