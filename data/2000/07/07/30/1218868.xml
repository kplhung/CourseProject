        <p>Iain Hamilton, a Scottish composer best known for his operas and other vocal works, died on July 21 in London. He was 78.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamilton was born in Glasgow and his family moved to London when he was 7. He attended the Mill Hill School there, and upon graduation he was apprenticed for seven years as an engineer.</p>
        <p>But in 1947 he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied composition and piano and graduated with high honors.</p>
        <p>In the 1950's, he was considered one of the bright young hopes of British music. But though his compositional ability was consistently praised, his stylistic fluctuations decreased the impact of his work. He began writing in a Neo-Classical tonal idiom and was then highly influenced by rigorous 12-tone techniques.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's, he returned to a more accessible harmonic language, including lighter works with a calypso flavor.</p>
        <p>In 1961, he left Britain to become a professor at Duke University, where he remained until 1968. He was a member of the composition faculty at the Tanglewood Music Center in Massachusetts the summer of 1962. During the 1971-72 concert season, his instrumental works were highlighted in a series of concerts by the New York Chamber Ensemble.</p>
        <p>In 1971, he returned to Glasgow, where he taught at the city's prestigious university. His opera ''The Royal Hunt of the Sun,'' adapted from the Peter Shaffer play, was given a well-received premiere in 1977 at the London Coliseum. His adaptation of Tolstoy's ''Anna Karenina,'' with a libretto by the stage director Colin Graham, was produced in London in 1981. He wrote several works for piano and four symphonies. The last symphony,  composed in 1981, received its premiere two years later in Edinburgh.</p>
