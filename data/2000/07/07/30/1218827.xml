        <p>Liberation Bookstore, a small shop at Lenox Avenue and 131st Street, has been a Harlem landmark since it opened in 1967. It is just four blocks south of ''speakers corner,'' where radical thinkers from Marcus Garvey to Malcolm X shared their political wisdom with Harlemites.</p>
        <p>A homey space packed to overflowing with books and other material on radical politics, the store is in many eyes as much a part of the neighborhood's fabric as the legacy of Malcolm himself.</p>
        <p>So on July 17, local residents were shocked when Una Mulzac, founder of the store, issued a press release saying she had been threatened with eviction. In the release, she said the management company was trying to force her out because they hoped to ''get 700 percent more for the space I am renting.'' (Ms. Mulzac declined to be interviewed for this article.)</p>
        <p>People in Harlem acted swiftly, gathering at the shop to show their support for Ms. Mulzac and holding demonstrations in front of the store. The Rev. Al Sharpton and the lawyer Alton Maddox Jr. took up the cause, as did The Amsterdam News and radio station WBAI.</p>
        <p>But what seemed at first like a straightforward case of gentrification threatening a local heroine turned out to be more complicated. The nonprofit co-op that had bought the building from the city a decade ago was facing financial trouble, and residents were in danger of losing their low-income apartments. The co-op owed more than $10,000 in utility and real estate taxes, said Angel A. Lavergne, president of Imani Management, the company that runs the building. As a result, the city was threatening to reclaim the property.</p>
        <p>''They can't pay what they owe if someone isn't paying,'' Mr. Lavergne said. According to him, the problem lay with Ms. Mulzac.</p>
        <p>In 1990, her monthly rent was increased to $930 from $550, but she never paid the difference.</p>
        <p>''I never signed the lease,'' she explained in her press release, ''and for that 10-year period I continued to pay the original rent. They accepted my checks and never took me to court.''</p>
        <p>In January, the co-op did take Ms. Mulzac to court, and according to Mr. Lavergne, she agreed to pay $6,600 and to vacate the building by June 30. When she failed to leave, marshals were set to evict her. But because of the local support, she managed to forstall any action, and  now the co-op is hoping to work out a plan under which she can remain.</p>
        <p>''I feel pretty optimistic that something positive will be the outcome,'' said Councilman Bill Perkins, who has mediated discussions between Ms. Mulzac and the co-op. ''Right now I don't think the eviction will happen.''</p>
