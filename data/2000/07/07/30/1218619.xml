        <p>THE tip of this Trylon was perfect. Not a chip or a bend. The Perisphere was pristine, unscratched, unspotted, its surface gleaming after 60 years. Whoever owned these brass-plated pot-metal bookends had treated them with the reverence they deserved.</p>
        <p>I entered my high bid in this Internet auction, under my nom de guerre, WF39, but as I surveyed the user ID's of the other bidders, I foresaw trouble. Here were my nemeses; the well-named ''Fairfiend,''  ''GroverW'' and especially ''exNY1940''; men and women possessed of pockets so deep and passions so large that seconds before the end of an auction, trigger finger on their mouse, they would make off with my Trylon and Peri sphere trophy, slamming my bid with a higher one, leaving me stunned and defeated.</p>
        <p>It was kitsch I craved, tchotchkes if you prefer, collectibles if you must, that had reduced me to this Dostoyevskian desperation, as time and again I prepared to go beyond my limits to possess that which I had to have, something wonderful from the fair.</p>
        <p>On my desk was a small Bakelite pencil sharpener, depicting the fair's symbols, the Trylon and Perisphere, in a smoky orange plastic, and though I honored it, I knew it was but a puny example of the T. and P. wonders that survived the fair. I hungered -- no, I lusted for -- more, knowing that more would never be enough. My sons had even jokingly threatened to hold a World's Fair intervention if I didn't stop my obsessive buying. I didn't need that to recognize that my life had been spinning out of control, dominated by a sphere and a spire that had been constructed on a former Corona, Queens, garbage dump.</p>
        <p>These ashtrays, lamps, thermometers, andirons and salt and pepper shakers shaped as sphere and spire are, for me, that fair in miniature. If I step on the gas, I'd have to say they will always mean to me and the other fair fiends a better tomorrow. Who wouldn't want to own a piece of that? Forget the fairs of Chicago, St. Louis, Paris and San Francisco. We know that there was only one world's fair that ever mattered, and it took place in New York in 1939-40.</p>
        <p>For the last three years I have been working as book writer and lyricist with the composer Wally Harper on a new musical comedy, ''Say Yes!,'' set in that World's Fair of 1940. It was developed with the director Jay Binder by the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center and will have its premiere at the Berkshire Theater Festival in Stockbridge, Mass., on Aug. 15. But its true origins can be found 60 years ago, when as a small boy my family took me to the fair. It was a life-changing experience.</p>
        <p>At the time, my family, like many middle-class families in New York, lived in an apartment where brown ruled. Forget your Fred and Ginger dancing against gleaming silvery white settings. For most of us, America in the late 30's was drab; shabby before that word was tied to chic; it was linoleum floors and oilcloth tablecloths, and it smelled of furniture polish and Murphy's Oil Soap. And then came the dazzling moderne whiteness of the New York World's Fair to open up a new vision of how to live.</p>
        <p>The theme of that fair, ''Building the World of Tomorrow,'' was not a come-on, it was a pay-off for the hard years of the Depression, which were coming to an end. New York was still suffering under a major economic slump. A committee headed by Grover Whalen, the city's official greeter, determined that the fair would celebrate the wonders of the consumer society. ''Consumer'' in 1939 was not a pejorative term; to be consumers was the wish of every family who looked in wonder at the inaccessible General Electric dishwasher and the streamlined Ford cars.</p>
        <p>A central-theme exhibit was needed to dramatize the fair's message. Enter Wallace K. Harrison, the architect behind Rockefeller Center and later the United Nations, a brilliant, pragmatic American modernist. Awarded the contract to design the theme center, Harrison began his design work for the monumental Trylon and Perisphere with a hairpin and a ball of putty. He claimed that the sphere he created was the ideal shape for the fair because a ball can enclose the largest possible amount of space with the smallest amount of material, while the natural contrasting form to a sphere is a tower. Further inspiration for the theme can be found in the drawings of the Russian Constructivists. Later it would be discovered that the closest ancestor of the fair's icons was the very antithesis of modernism, an 1875 engraving, ''Within the Gates'' by A. I. Rice, a scene of swooning spirits facing a fully formed Trylon and Perisphere, the artist's paradisiacal dream of heaven. There is no denying that there was something in these shapes, their great size and their relationship to each other that was magical. And to bottom it off, the fountain below the Perisphere created the illusion of a huge ball floating on air.</p>
        <p>The path to the fair was also paved by the movies. The Emerald City of Oz would have fit in comfortably at the fair, Munchkins and all. That hidden city of peace and brotherly love, Shangri-La, in the film ''Lost Horizon'' (1937), was a modern white pavilion, another candidate for fairdom. The hunger for peace in a war-torn world, expressed in that film, met its match in reality at the fair, as the 1939 theme, ''The World of Tomorrow,'' gave way to ''For Peace and Freedom'' in 1940.</p>
        <p>The pull of the future must have been remarkable, because my parents, wary of crowds with their threat of polio epidemics, conquered their fears and took my sister, Simone, and me to view ''The World of Tomorrow.'' Despite its architectural distinction, the fair was primarily family fun, and there was more than a bit of carney in its heart.</p>
        <p>It is claimed that Walt Disney got his notion for Disneyland from the '39 fair. But to say that it was the precursor of Disneyland is to diminish it, for the early Disneyland offered a cozy make-believe past, while the fair gave us a spacious, gleaming make-believe future, far preferable to most Americans, who saw their recent past as something to surmount, not celebrate.</p>
        <p>The fair set its sights on 1960 as its future. Many of its predictions would come true: machines would wash dishes and clothes, cars would be streamlined, suburbs would abound, television would entertain us and interstate highways would connect, and separate, us.</p>
        <p>But the futurists of the time did not foresee the possibility of abandoned inner cities or the devastating consequences of economic and racial inequality. With World War II just around the corner, the fair's architects and industrial designers seemed to suggest that many of the world's ills could be cured by the judicious use of pale geometric shapes, with fountains and lagoons, leading to a new, modernist aesthetic that would assure a just society.</p>
        <p>There was a breathtaking innocence to that fair. There was also that inexorable American optimism symbolized in the Trylon and Perisphere, undefeated by the Depression, strong despite the victories of fascism in Europe and the closing of the pavilions of the conquered nations.</p>
        <p>With all this in mind -- well, actually with none of this in mind -- Wally Harper and I set out to memorialize the world of the fair in our musical, abetted by the souvenir Heinz pickle pins and Planter's Peanut men, hoping to capture the comic postcard charm that was also its hallmark. So, if I cannot repossess the symbols of my youth on eBay, I am privileged to relive it onstage with ''Say Yes!'' And if the show is successful, watch out Fairfiend, WF39 will be unstoppable.</p>
