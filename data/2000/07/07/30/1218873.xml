        <p>Every day's mail brings news releases announcing alterations -- in wines, product lines, labels, prices -- intended for publicity and a crumb or slice of market share. None could invite a ho-hum or skepticism more than one about 1999 Fazi-Battaglia.</p>
        <p>Fazi, long a low-priced white in a transparent emerald-green amphora-shaped bottle (fish-shaped, some say), dates from around 1949, when America's culinari favored Piel's beer, pink Lancers or Gallo chablis. Yet the news about the 1999 edition, an upgraded wine now in an opaque dark-olive bottle, plus the bottle's sleek feel and serious weight said: attenzione!</p>

        <p>Every day's mail brings news releases announcing alterations -- in wines, product lines, labels, prices -- intended for publicity and a crumb or slice of market share. None could invite a ho-hum or skepticism more than one about 1999 Fazi-Battaglia.</p>
        <p>Fazi, long a low-priced white in a transparent emerald-green amphora-shaped bottle (fish-shaped, some say), dates from around 1949, when America's culinari favored Piel's beer, pink Lancers or Gallo chablis. Yet the news about the 1999 edition, an upgraded wine now in an opaque dark-olive bottle, plus the bottle's sleek feel and serious weight said: attenzione!</p>
        <p>First, tuned-in Italians know that in the Marches region the native verdicchio grape can produce first-class wines that, young and fresh, are strikingly refreshing. Second, Franco Bernabei, a respected consulting enologist, superintends Fazi's verdicchio. Third, Fazi's grape source is Castelli di Jesi, the classico -- historical, thus presumably ideal -- zone for cultivating the grape.</p>
        <p>If New York's raw bars and fish stores had wine faucets, you'd happily turn the handle marked C for chilled Fazi '99 verdicchio.</p>
        <p>Eddies of lemon and lime inflect the perfume, then the flavor. The wine, as clear as an Adriatic dawn, as light as a cotton puff, as dry as a rock, immediately satisfies. Straightforward and simple, the light fruit is borne by a racy acidity that trails into a long tantalizingly bitter nuttiness.</p>
        <p>The '99 costs $6 at Warehouse, 735 Broadway (East Eighth Street); $6 at North End, 2509 Webster Avenue (Fordham Road), in the Bronx; $7.60. at Pete Milano's, 1441 Forest Avenue, Port Richmond, Staten Island.</p>
