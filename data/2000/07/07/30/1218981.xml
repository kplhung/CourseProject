        <p>The agreement, first reported by The Daily News, came late last week after Mr. Mills threatened to take Schools Chancellor Harold O.

        <p>The state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, has agreed to administer tests for teachers in August to help the city overcome a lack of certified teachers in failing schools.</p>
        <p>The agreement, first reported by The Daily News, came late last week after Mr. Mills threatened to take Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy to court if he continued to allow uncertified teachers to work in the city's worst schools. Last year, 585 uncertified teachers worked in those schools.</p>
        <p>To overcome the problem, this summer the city initiated a ''teaching fellows'' program to attract people with no education experience, Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education, said yesterday. The city received 2,000 applications for 250 slots, she said.</p>
        <p>But to teach in underperforming schools while taking part in the program, which includes 200 hours of training, the state had required applicants to pass exams in liberal arts and sciences, and in a specialty area like math. The next exams had been scheduled to take place in October, Ms. Crowe said, several weeks after the school year began.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, the test date will be moved up to Aug 19. Results will be available by Sept. 1, before the school l year begins.</p>
