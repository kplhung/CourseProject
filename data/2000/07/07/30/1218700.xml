        <p>VIRTUALLY every new car comes with a warranty that protects the buyer against major mechanical problems for a specific period of time or for maximum amount of mileage.</p>
        <p>So, then, what kind of warranty do you get when you buy a new house?</p>
        <p>The answer, it seems, depends on where the house is.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, state law requires that all new single-family houses and condominiums to come with a 10-year warranty.</p>
        <p>In New York, the law creates an ''implied warranty'' that protects buyers of new homes for up to six years. But unlike New Jersey, New York allows builders to modify the warranty with the buyer's consent.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, where state law provides buyers with a basic one-year warranty, experts say that its scope depends almost entirely on what the buyer's lawyer manages to wriggle into the sales contract.</p>
        <p>Peter Desch, the chief of the Bureau of Homeowner Protection in New Jersey's Department of Community Affairs in Trenton, said that under state law, before builders can obtain certificates of occupancy, they  must present a receipt for a fully paid 10-year new-home warranty, the terms of which are set by statute. They can buy the warranty directly from the state's New Home Warranty Program or from a state-approved private warranty company that offers the same coverage.</p>
        <p>''During the first year, it covers a host of things that could be wrong with new construction,'' Mr. Desch said. They range  from floor squeaks and roof leaks to cracks in the foundation and structural defects.</p>
        <p>''The coverage decreases over time,'' he said. During the second year, the warranty covers only structural defects and flaws in the electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems. From the third through 10th years, the warranty covers only major structural defects -- in other words, serious structural problems caused by actual physical damage.</p>
        <p>''As good as this program is, one of the things that people miss is that this is only a limited warranty,'' Mr. Desch said, explaining that there are some things that are not covered. Among them are sidewalks, driveways, pools and outbuildings like sheds and detached garages.</p>
        <p>When a homeowner files a claim during the first two years of the warranty, Mr. Desch said, the Bureau of Homeowner Protection sends out an arbitrator to meet with the homeowner and the builder to determine whether the claim is valid. If it is -- and the decision of the arbitrator is binding either way -- the state will order the builder to make the necessary repairs. If the builder refuses to do so, Mr. Desch said, the department can bar the builder from constructing new homes in the state.</p>
        <p>For claims filed during the third through 10th years of the warranty, he said, the builder is no longer obligated to perform the repairs. Instead, the state sends out a claims adjuster to determine if the claim is valid. If it is, the adjuster will authorize the owner to hire someone to make the necessary repairs.</p>
        <p>In such cases, Mr. Desch said, and in cases where the builder is out of business, bankrupt or refuses to cooperate, the money for the work comes out of the state's New Home Warranty Trust Fund, which is replenished by the fees builders pay the state for the warranties.</p>
        <p>''Over the past 20 years we've paid out about $35 million in claims,'' Mr. Desch said.</p>
        <p>New York's statutory warranty on new homes works somewhat differently.</p>
        <p>Douglas F. Wasser, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that under Section 777 of the state's General Business Law, there is a  six-year implied warranty on any new home. It requires that the house be free of all defects for a year after the sale.</p>
        <p>''That is defined by the law as meaning that workmanship and materials meet or exceed the standards of the applicable building code,'' Mr. Wasser said.</p>
        <p>During the second year, he said, the warranty only covers mechanical systems -- including plumbing, electrical, heating, cooling and ventilating -- and ''material defects,'' defined as actual physical damage to load-bearing parts of the house that would make it unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unlivable.</p>
        <p>During the third through sixth years of the warranty, Mr. Wasser said, only material defects are covered.</p>
        <p>Aside from the time periods covered, there are other significant differences between New Jersey's New Home Warranty Program and New York's implied warranty.</p>
        <p>For example, while New Jersey's program provides both a system for handling claims and money to pay them, New York's implied warranty provides neither. And while every new home in New Jersey comes with the same basic warranty, builders in New York are free to negotiate with buyers to modify or even eliminate the protection of the implied warranty.</p>
        <p>''The weakest link in the New York law is the builder's ability to disclaim the warranty,'' said Michael Liss, a White Plains real estate lawyer, referring to the fact if the buyer agrees in the sales contract, builders can substitute their own warranties in place of the statutory one. In fact, he said, some builders insist upon a  cap on the amount they will be liable for.</p>
        <p>''This is where lawyers really start to worry,'' Mr. Liss said. ''If the builder puts a $100,000 cap on the warranty, and you've got a house with real problems, then you're out of luck for any repairs above the $100,000.''</p>
        <p>But no matter what the warranty or its terms, the only way for an owner to force a recalcitrant builder to make repairs is to take the builder to court.</p>
        <p>''Most buyers' lawyers wince at handling new construction,'' Mr. Liss said. ''The contracts get too complicated, and there are usually too many postconstruction claims to deal with.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers in Connecticut face similar challenges.</p>
        <p>''In Connecticut, the only warranty you get by law is that everything is going to work for one year from the date of closing,'' said William Selsberg, a Stamford real estate lawyer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Selsberg said that the state's  implied-warranty law provides that new homes will be free of faulty materials, designed according to sound engineering standards and constructed in a workmanlike manner that results in a house that is fit for habitation.</p>
        <p>''The warranty does not apply to any conditions that an inspection by a reasonably diligent purchaser would reveal,'' Mr. Selsberg said.  Such vague provisions leave real estate lawyers no choice but to try to craft their own warranties by inserting them into the sales contract and getting the builder to agree to them, he said.</p>
        <p>''It takes a lot of guesswork on the part of the buyer's lawyer to try to cover every possible contingency,'' Mr. Selsberg said. ''And when all is said and done, agreements and warranties are only as good as the people who make them.''</p>
