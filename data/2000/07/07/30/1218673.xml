        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>A conversation overheard at the West Coast Video in Lawrence Township between two beefy, tattoed men who were draped in chains:</p>
        <p>First man: ''Man, I can't believe that 'American Beauty' beat out 'The Sixth Sense' for best picture last year.''</p>
        <p>Second Man: ''Yeah. 'American Beauty' was just so . . . so . . . common.''</p>
        <p>ALISON ROTH</p>
        <p>REVERE REVISITED</p>
        <p>Listen, my children, and you shall hear</p>
        <p>The revisionist ride of Paul Revere</p>
        <p>Who, in this apocryphal tale, rides south</p>
        <p>Through Marlboro Township, hand cupped to mouth,</p>
        <p>Shouting, ''One if by land and two if by sea,''</p>
        <p>Till he's stopped in his tracks, changing history.</p>
        <p>''Whoa!'' shouts the sheriff. ''When you cupped your hand</p>
        <p>It left the reins, which is clearly banned.''</p>
        <p>The British arrived, unopposed, by sail</p>
        <p>While Paul spent the night in the township jail.</p>

        <p>I had this coversation with a 6-year-old in a Hoboken park one recent Sunday morning:</p>
        <p>Me: ''Hi, where are your parents?''</p>
        <p>Child: ''They're home. I'm with my babysitter.''</p>
        <p>Me (understandingly): ''Oh, they're home resting?''</p>
        <p>Child: ''No, they're watching TV.''</p>
        <p>Me: ''Really?''</p>
        <p>Child: ''Yes, they want to know if the Stocking Change is up or the Stocking Change is down.''</p>
        <p>MARIKO LOCKHART</p>
        <p>While running on the towpath of the Delaware-Raritan Canal, I noticed the spray-painted graffiti on the concrete supports for Interstate 287. There were many tags in the illegibly cryptographic contemporary style, but also a couple in the style of the old masters of New York like ''Taki 183,'' whose tag was derived from his nickname plus the number of the street where he lived.</p>
        <p>But these graffiti had a New Jersey twist: ''E-Love Exit 9'' and ''DW Exit 1.''</p>
        <p>NANCY FRYER CROFT</p>
        <p>PROSTRATE FROM MY PROSTATE</p>
        <p>From slumber's soft enfolding arms</p>
        <p>From dreams like myrhh and warmth so sweet</p>
        <p>Nightly do I abruptly leap</p>
        <p>My sacred rendezvous to keep</p>
        <p>The enfant terrible around my bladder</p>
        <p>Has no remorse my sleep to shatter</p>
        <p>This 3 a.m. tyrant fills me with hate</p>
        <p>As I stumble to urinate.</p>

        <p>Our new stock girl, Natalie, fielded a call from a customer with her usual verve. When she reported that the woman was coming in to look at a gown for a ''bird mitzvah,'' she received a detailed explanation of the difference between a bar mitzvah and a bat mitzvah and was assured that there was no such thing as a bird mitzvah. And despite some ridicule, Natalie held her ground.</p>
        <p>Two days later, a stunning blonde came in for the red gown, and explained that the ''bird mitzvah'' was for an African gray parrot, hence the the red and grey dress code.</p>
