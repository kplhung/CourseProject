        <p>Peter Frank letter on Anthony Tommasini's July 9 article on American serialism recalls academic and intellectual bullying by serialists and acolytes as student at Columbia University (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Anthony Tommasini's commentary on American serialism [''Midcentury Serialists: The Bullies or the Besieged?,'' July 9] reads Joseph Straus's Musical Quarterly article closely, but responds to it rather too much from Mr. Tommasini's memories of his Yale days at the tail end of the period Mr. Straus examined. Intellectual and academic bullying by the serialists and their acolytes did indeed take place; as a student at Columbia at the same time, I recall friends variously chafing at such treatment and meting it out. Especially by the late 60's, however, such dictatorship of the dodecaphony held sway on only a few campuses, almost all of them on the East Coast: Princeton, Columbia, Yale, Brandeis, etc. Had Mr. Tommasini studied at the University of Illinois, the State University of New York at Buffalo, the California Institute of the Arts or even Bennington College -- all of which employed prominent 60's avant-gardists -- he would have encountered very different musical climates, ones that often pointedly ignored serialism or regarded themselves as alternatives to serialist dogma.</p>

        <p>Anthony Tommasini's commentary on American serialism [''Midcentury Serialists: The Bullies or the Besieged?,'' July 9] reads Joseph Straus's Musical Quarterly article closely, but responds to it rather too much from Mr. Tommasini's memories of his Yale days at the tail end of the period Mr. Straus examined. Intellectual and academic bullying by the serialists and their acolytes did indeed take place; as a student at Columbia at the same time, I recall friends variously chafing at such treatment and meting it out. Especially by the late 60's, however, such dictatorship of the dodecaphony held sway on only a few campuses, almost all of them on the East Coast: Princeton, Columbia, Yale, Brandeis, etc. Had Mr. Tommasini studied at the University of Illinois, the State University of New York at Buffalo, the California Institute of the Arts or even Bennington College -- all of which employed prominent 60's avant-gardists -- he would have encountered very different musical climates, ones that often pointedly ignored serialism or regarded themselves as alternatives to serialist dogma.</p>
        <p>The appearance of three articles near Mr. Tommasini's concerning electronic music of the same era further reminds us that the serialists shared departments with colleagues who laid claim to other cutting-edge techniques, techniques that only incidentally addressed questions of pitch organization. The presence at Columbia, for instance, of the electronic music pioneer (and resolute tonalist) Otto Luening and his partner-in-concrete Vladimir Ussachevsky served as a counterweight to the influence of junior colleagues like Charles Wuorinen.</p>
        <p>The serialists themselves began to ''loosen up'' in the late 60's, coming to acknowledge the dryness of their styles, if not of the dodecaphonic method itself. Mr. Wuorinen, for one, found a persuasively lyrical voice with ''Grand Bamboula'' and other works composed, by his own admission, in the wake of the 1971 death of Igor Stravinsky.</p>
