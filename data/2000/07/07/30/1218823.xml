        <p>It was 11 a.m. on a bright and sunny morning in the Balearics, the type of blue-sky day when one wants nothing more than to sip sangria on a white sand beach and read Hemingway.

        <p>The latter was the choice of Howard Boyle, 22, of Brighton, England, who was dressed this morning as (who else?) Elvis.

        <p>It was 11 a.m. on a bright and sunny morning in the Balearics, the type of blue-sky day when one wants nothing more than to sip sangria on a white sand beach and read Hemingway. Or perhaps to stay up 24 hours straight listening to house music, sweating like a pig in a fur coat and dancing with 10,000 strangers.</p>
        <p>The latter was the choice of Howard Boyle, 22, of Brighton, England, who was dressed this morning as (who else?) Elvis. He was doing all he could to flag the attention of a bartender at the Space nightclub, where the biggest weekly party in Europe was in its 12th hour, and still going strong.</p>
        <p>''I swear to you, it never ends,'' Mr. Boyle said, his Elvis wig in hand and a grin from sideburn to sideburn. ''And really, now, why should it?''</p>
        <p>Welcome to Ibiza, the Mediterranean island whose carnivalesque club scene makes Mardi Gras look like an ice-cream social. Parties here don't end; they simply move to another location. Many of the revelers at Space, for example, would remain until late afternoon, then head to the Bora Bora beach, an idyllic stretch of white sand a block away, where topless girls and awestruck boys often dance until the sun goes down and the cycle starts all over again. The common refrain at all the clubs is a kind of dance-driven decadence, underscored by loud to too-loud house or trance music, or some derivative, each with enough beats per minute to give a hummingbird agita.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, the giant Monday night fiesta called Manumission, a lavish night-to-day extravaganza held in an arena-size club named Privilege. It regularly draws more than 10,000 people and sets new standards for sexually graphic, obscure and just plain strange entertainment.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the spectacle included midgets on stilts, acrobats dangling from the club's 100-foot ceiling, a wall of falling water and more thongs than a Sisquo video. The profusion of spangles, glitter and body paint worn by the huge crowd probably had dire environmental implications. This is where Elvis spent the first 11 hours of his night, bopping to nonstop music, all spun by solemn-looking disc jockeys on a circular island in the middle of the club's swimming pool.</p>
        <p>Privilege is just one of at least a dozen huge discos on Ibiza, which has transformed itself into a club-hopper's destination resort. There are billboards advertising discos, a disco bus whose drivers play techno, and even disco package tours, like one from Bring It On Travel that offers a package of seven nights, round-trip airfare from New York and two free club passes for $1,359. (Motto: ''On the beach till 7 p.m. In the clubs till 9 a.m.'')</p>
        <p>Ibiza has been known for discotheques since as far back as the 1970's, but it was in the late 80's, when the island became a focal point of international rave culture, that the scene began gathering new momentum. Today, the crowds have never been bigger, with a majority of clubbers from Britain. Of 1.35 million visitors who invaded during the club season from June to mid-September last year, more than 500,000 were from England, according to the island's tourism bureau, compared with 355,000 English tourists during all of 1990. Well-known British clubs like Ministry of Sound, Cream and Gatecrasher sponsor summer satellites in Ibiza, banking on the appeal of star disc jockeys like Paul Okenfold. This summer, there are more American D.J.'s playing, including Junior Vasquez, part of what island veterans call a growing American presence.</p>
        <p>''There's loads of Americans,'' said Rod Lay, who runs the Trade party, another London import, at Privilege. Celebrity sightings are also on the rise, with local gossip sheets reporting Donna Karan, Stella McCartney and Kate Moss on the island this summer.</p>
        <p>For average clubbers, the growing global electronica movement is part of the draw, but it is also an open secret that many come here to capitalize on the ready availability of party drugs like Ecstasy, GHB and ketamine hydrochloride, an animal anesthetic known as Special K. Pills of Ecstasy are especially cheap and plentiful, running $7 to $10 each -- the street rate is about $25 in New York -- with dealers frequenting many of the clubs and bars, even working taxi lines, where clubbers can wait for as long as two hours.</p>
        <p>All of which inspires some ''good old days'' sentimentality among the more veteran party people.</p>
        <p>''I remember Phil Collins being played here,'' said Boy George, the pop star turned disc jockey, who has been a regular in Ibiza clubs since 1988. He had just completed a set at Amnesia. ''Everybody stopped, and looked, and said, 'Why not?' and kept dancing,'' he said. ''Things used to be much more experimental.''</p>
        <p>If Ibiza residents feel overwhelmed by the clubgoing hordes, there have been few official moves to hold back the tide. Tourism has made the island and its neighbor Majorca two of the richest spots in Spain, and construction cranes loom all around the central harbor. Residents seem to express any ambivalence simply by patronizing their own bars and restaurants, separate from the megaclubs.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the only thing that hasn't changed is the island itself, with its exceptionally strong sun, plenteous white sand beaches and rolling landscape dotted with olive and pine trees, vineyards and windmills. In short, a great place to spend lots of time sweating in dark, loud rooms, which is exactly what I did on a 48-hour tour of the clubs.</p>
        <p>Most don't open before 11 p.m. or midnight, and the concept of arriving too late is unheard of. ''I'll be there at 3 a.m.,'' one promoter told me. He was an hour late.</p>
        <p>Many of the low-budget clubbers take advantage of the disco bus, a midnight-to-6 a.m. limited on which partyers, male and female, adjust their makeup. Its main route is east from Ibiza town, the island's major port and capital, to San Antonio, an unruly beach town that is home to some of the older clubs with lower cover prices.</p>
        <p>The major one here is Es Paradis Terrenal (Paradise on Earth). A quick visit proved enlightening: paradise will apparently include air hockey machines, a gift boutique and go-go dancers. I felt reassured about my afterlife.</p>
        <p>Es Paradis is also home to one of the newest gimmicks on the island: the Fiesta del Agua. As the name implies, water is involved. Every Friday night the club inundates part of its dance floor with a few inches of water and sprays the dancers. Female clubbers who have experienced the Fiesta del Agua say they enjoy the cool water on their warm bodies; male partygoers say they enjoy exactly the same thing.</p>
        <p>Ibiza town is home to Space, Pacha and a yacht club turned nightclub, El Divino, where a popular night known as Miss Moneypenny's is well known by the city's temporary and resident transvestite communities.</p>
        <p>Between the two towns, on a treacherous stretch of unlighted highway, are the two biggest clubs: Privilege and Amnesia. Amnesia boasts twice-weekly dance-floor foam parties (six feet of bubbles, swimsuits not required). Its owner, Martin Ferrer, claims to be the first man ever to fill a dance floor with foam. He said the idea came to him in a dream. ''I just saw people dancing,'' he said. ''In bubbles.''</p>
        <p>With a capacity of 4,000 to 5,000 a night (depending on which way the authorities are looking), $12 cocktails and cover charges sometimes topping $40, Amnesia seems to do well. The night I visited, it was packed shoulder to shoulder with sweaty bodies. ''These clubs aren't making a fortune selling alcohol,'' a publicist named Marcello told me. ''They're making a fortune selling water.'' At $6 for a small bottle, I could see his point. Amnesia's newest toy, a specially designed ''fog gun,'' blasted jets of frozen air into the crowd, to great rejoicing.</p>
        <p>While Amnesia is big, there is apparently no club bigger than Privilege, and no night bigger than Manumission at Privilege. The night, started by the British team of Mike and Claire Manumission, uses some 80 entertainers to amuse the crowd. Its graphically sexual displays are legendary; on Monday, they included a group of Puerto Rican strippers from New York, a troupe of Brazilian feather dancers and a bodybuilder with a talent for contortion.</p>
        <p>The club, roughly the size of a small sporting arena, used to be open air but was forced to build a soaring steel roof several years ago after complaints about the noise. Visual distraction abounds: a two-story Buddha in the corner, three dozen disco balls hanging over the dance floor in a small side room. Above the main dance floors are dozens of circular screens, on which a constant stream of surreal images are projected; I seem to remember a giant cube emblazoned with the word ''Orange'' intercut with a Clara Bow movie. The images are all synchronized with the pounding music, resulting in an effect just this side of hallucination.</p>
        <p>Those standing in line to enter Manumission often take more than an hour to work their way from sidewalk to entrance, and though everyone gets in eventually, the scene can be ugly. The night I visited, fights nearly broke out amid would-be soccer rowdies who were singing rival team songs. There were also other signs of trouble, with a dealer openly offering samples of GHB.</p>
        <p>Inside, however, the vibe was reverential. The partyers, almost all in their late teens and 20's, with two men for every woman, kept their eyes peeled on Tall Paul, who led them through hours of alternately soaring and screaming music without a break. For all the eroticism of the floor shows, most people danced alone, which is in the nature of the hyperkinetic music.</p>
        <p>The party would run until 10 a.m., when Privilege closed, and then shift to Space, about seven miles away. Die-hards would travel there, some hitchhiking, others walking like disco refugees.</p>
        <p>When I arrived after a nap, the party at Space was still on, with about 300 people crowding the outside terrace, eating watermelon, drinking and dancing to mellower fare, and 300 more inside, still skipping along on the harder house music. I had a Red Bull -- a high-powered caffeine drink that is a club favorite -- to wake up, and then encountered Mr. Boyle, wearing his white Elvis outfit and sporting three-inch sideburns.</p>
        <p>''Hey, baby,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He told me he usually performed at Manumission, re-enacting the King's demise in a Graceland bathroom for 10,000 appreciative fans. Tonight, however, his act had been foiled by ''some jealous Spanish performers,'' who he believed had stolen his toilet. (This account could not be confirmed. Ever. In a million years.)</p>
        <p>He then launched into his personal story about how he got to Ibiza. As best I could follow, there was an affair with an older woman, an Ozzy Osbourne concert and an initial ''three-day bender'' in Ibiza. Before he knew it, he said, he was Elvis. A friend confirmed his status. ''He really looks like him,'' this jittery young man said. ''A combination of the fat old one and the good-looking young one.''</p>
        <p>I took my leave. It was 1 p.m., after all, and from the looks of the blazing sun, the evening, if not the party, was over. I'll admit I felt conflicted. The crowd at the front door of Space was growing. And beyond the walls, the music, as it always is in Ibiza, was still pumping.</p>
