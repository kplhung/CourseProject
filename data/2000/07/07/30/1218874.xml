        <p>For a while now, the stock market has been lifted by better economic growth and stronger corporate earnings than anyone had a right to expect, given the Federal Reserve's insistent stamping on the interest-rate brakes all spring.</p>
        <p>Last week, though, black clouds gathered over two volatile sectors, telecommunications and e-commerce, and investors started to bolt.</p>
        <p>Naturally, the damage was most visible in the Nasdaq composite, which is heavily larded with such stocks. The index finished at 3,663.00, off 431.45 points or 10.54 percent for the week. The blue-chip indexes held up better, with the Dow Jones industrial average slipping just 2.07 percent for the week to finish at 10,511.17, well within the trading range in which it has been oscillating since early May. Markets in the rest of the world were soft as well, though few experienced the kind of decline visited on the Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>Yields on 30-year Treasuries took little notice of the stunningly robust economic growth figures released last week and drifted to a close at 5.785 percent Friday. The dollar gained value marginally overseas, finishing the week worth 109.59 Japanese yen or 1.083 euros.</p>

        <p>DATA BANK: JULY 24-28  Correction:  August 6, 2000, Sunday  The Stocks in the News chart on the DataBank page last Sunday referred incorrectly to the company whose stock price fell after it said second-quarter earnings would be much lower than analysts' forecasts. It is Lands' End, not Land's End.</p>
