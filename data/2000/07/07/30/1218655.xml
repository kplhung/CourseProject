        <p>AS civilization advances,'' the English statesman Thomas Babington Macaulay noted in 1825, ''poetry almost necessarily declines.''</p>
        <p>In a little sunken garden in Farmington, Macaulay's words are being disproved. Here, in the pretty perennial garden of the Hill-Stead Museum on Mountain Road, some 3,500 people spread out on the lawn during the summer to be soothed, saddened, terrified, tickled, enlightened, amused, bemused and otherwise emotionally charged by the way they relate to one poet's words.</p>
        <p>They come to put the pressures of their professions aside. A random sampling of the audience at the last poetry reading on July 19 found scientists, politicians, computer technicians, stockbrokers, artists, writers, teachers, a doctor, a lawyer, a plumber and a grocery-store cashier.</p>
        <p>Courtney Brown of New Milford, who was at a recent poetry reading at the Sunken Garden Poetry Festival, said she spends her days buried in numbers as an accountant at Washington's Devereux-Glenholme School.</p>
        <p>''So coming here, to this little oasis, is a real turn-around from the 9 to 5,'' she said. ''This is my second time here and I plan to come back every chance I can get.''</p>
        <p>The festival, in its ninth year, has become one of the largest free poetry series in the nation. The festival was founded by the museum and Northeast magazine in 1992 as a series for a small, devoted band of poetry lovers. But even the first reading drew an unexpectedly enormous crowd, said Alison Meyers, the festival's director.</p>
        <p>''Right from the start, this series has been quite phenomenally attended,'' she said. ''It's entered into the realm of myth.''</p>
        <p>Virtual coffee shop poetry readings are popping up on the Internet, and live chat rooms are dedicated to the subject. ''There is unquestionably a renaissance occurring with poetry, particularly in the oral sense,'' Ms. Meyers said. ''In some funky way, the technology is assisting rather than hindering it.''</p>
        <p>An evening at the Sunken Garden Poetry Festival should begin early. The poetry part of the night starts at 7:30, preceded by an hour of live music, but be sure to make time to visit the turn-of-the-century Colonial Revival mansion on the grounds, which opens at 5 on festival nights.</p>
        <p>This is what the evening was like on June 19, the night that featured poet Susan Kinsolving of Bridgewater and the musical trio, Serenata. First, there was a tour of the 14-room museum, a National Historic Landmark, which is set on 152 acres of fields and woodlands, and is filled with a collection of antiques and Impressionist paintings by Monet, Manet, Degas, Whistler and Cassatt.</p>
        <p>Then it was on to the Kitchen Garden, a little paradise where people picnic before the poetry and musical performances (no food or drinks are allowed in the Sunken Garden).</p>
        <p>Next, visitors went into the tiered Sunken Garden, which was fullof white roses, deep blue delphinium, purple pincushions, pink dahlias, lavender catmint and countless other plantings that complement the palette of the museum's art. They were soon listening to the harp, flute and soprano voice of the three women who make up the group, Serenata.</p>
        <p>Then Ms. Kinsolving entered the amphitheater, approached the lectern and began reading from her two anthologies, ''Among Flowers'' (Random House, 1993) and ''Dailies &amp; Rushes'' (Grove Press, 1999,), which has been nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award for 2000.</p>
        <p>''Dailies &amp; Rushes is a term from the motion picture business, of which my husband [William Kinsolving] is a part, and it is the term for the footage at the end of a day's shoot that's rushed in to be developed,'' she explained in her deep, dramatic drawl. ''Anyway, 'Dailies &amp; Rushes has caused me no end of problems. When I read in L.A., it's fine, but here on the East Coast, people don't know what this means.''</p>
        <p>The crowd roared with laughter as she explained the inspiration for another poem, ''At The Florist.'' While shopping for lilies one day, Mrs. Kinsolving witnessed a florist asking a customer if he'd like to have the pollen-filled anthers, which can stain, removed from his flowers. ''I saw this buxom  florist, a kind of Mae West of a woman, waiting on a rather diminutive man. And she put her hand on her hip and said, 'Do ya want your anthers cut off?'</p>
        <p>The result was a rhymed couplet, which lends itself so well to humor:</p>
        <p>''When asked if he wanted/his anthers cut off,/he paused for a moment,/dissembled a cough,/Then mumbled and shrugged/ 'I'm only a layman.'</p>
        <p>'But surely ' she smiled/ 'you know about stamens/ And all of the grief/that's caused by their spread.''</p>
        <p>And so it goes until the florist finally gives them the big snip. ''Now your garments won't need/to visit the cleaner;/there's no stain in nature/as tough or obscener/Than the anther's satanic/impregnating dust,/those tiny male nuggets/ full of tangible lust.''</p>
        <p>Many in the crowd cried as they listened to her wrenching accounts of a broken heart in ''Parting Gift,'' or to ''Happenstance,'' a poem about her uncle being murdered by a madman. She also described her love for her husband and their two daughters, Caroline and Eliza.</p>
        <p>Among the crowd cheering Ms. Kinsolving with a standing ovation was William Walker, her teacher in 1965 at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, Calif., ''whose great gift in the classroom was life-changing for me,'' the poet said.</p>
        <p>Tears dribbled down Mr. Walker's cheeks. ''I remember Susan to this day, so vividly, sitting in the second row, absolutely gleaming over words. I suppose you could say her passion for poetry was ignited back then. And now she's spreading the flame, everywhere she goes.''</p>
        <p>Three more poetry readings are scheduled through August, the next one being ''A Night of Fresh Voices'' on Wednesday, featuring eight Connecticut students who won the statewide Young Poets Competition. For more information, call (860) 677-4787.</p>
