        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>Jazz invades Oyster Bay this weekend as the Friends of the Arts's ''Dime Jazz Festival'' takes over Planting Fields Arboretum for three evenings. It gets under way Friday at 8 p.m. with Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, a band that combines pop, bluegrass and country with jazz, and Soulive, a relatively new trio that fuses funk and jazz. Come Saturday and the JazzTimes Superband warms things up at 6 p.m. for the Branford Marsalis Quartet and Cassandra Wilson, the Grammy-winning vocalist. On Sunday at 7 p.m. Chuck Loeb, the guitarist-composer, performs, followed by Spyro Gyra (516) 922-0061.</p>
        <p>Music in Bridgehampton</p>
        <p>On the East End, more quality music makes its appearance Wednesday when the Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival begins its three-week run of nine concerts and two benefits. Joined by such artists as Ani Kavafian, violinist, and Timothy Eddy, cellist, (Wednesday through next Sunday); Pamela Frank, violinist, (Aug. 12 and 13) and a special guest star, the soprano-actress Audra McDonald (Aug. 13), Marya Martin, a flutist and the festival's artistic director, has put together a schedule that includes programs like ''Becoming Beethoven,'' Wednesday; ''Young at Heart'' with works by Copland and Mendelssohn, next Sunday; ''Myths and Mood Swings,'' featuring music by Adam Guettel, Richard Rodgers's grandson, Aug. 13; and ''East Wind,'' featuring Borodin, Dvorak and Martinu, Aug. 20. There will be children's concerts on Thursday and Aug. 17 at the festival's home in the air-conditioned Presbyterian Church on Main Street, and benefit concerts Saturday at the Atlantic Golf Club and Aug. 12 at the Channing Daughters Winery, both in Bridgehampton (631) 537-6368.</p>
        <p>Pianofest Ends</p>
        <p>Pianofest in the Hamptons, the program that brings promising young pianists from all over the world to the South Fork for eight weeks of coaching and performing, completes its season Saturday with its annual ''Grand Marathon Concert.'' Sixteen of the 18 pianists who participated this year will appear starting at 7 p.m. and, with three reception-breaks, play on and on and probably on. That's after the series's regular session of playing and commentary tomorrow at 2 p.m. This all takes place at Southampton College's Avram Fine Arts Theater (631) 329-9115.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare Takes Over</p>
        <p>Shakespeare's appeal as hot-weather fare is evident this week as three different companies take to the boards with their versions of three of his works. Today at 7 p.m., the Arena Players offer their final ''Much Ado About Nothing'' and, continuing their season at the Mansion Courtyard of the Vanderbilt Museum in Centerport, return on Thursday with ''Romeo and Juliet.'' The tragedy will be performed through August (631) 854-5550. Tomorrow, the Blue Heron Theater Company completes its run at Guild Hall's John Drew Theater in East Hampton with a staged reading of the comedy ''As You Like It'' at 7 p.m. (631) 324-4050. ''Much Ado About Nothing'' is also the choice of the Hamptons Shakespeare Festival for its fifth season. After previews Wednesday through Friday (and a ''Kids Luv Shakespeare'' performance at 10 a.m. tomorrow) the festiva's version of the romantic comedy will be performed from Saturday through Aug. 20 at Roosevelt County Park in Montauk and then moves on, from Aug. 24 to Sept. 3, to Agawam Park in Southampton. There's a benefit picnic dinner at 5 p.m. on Saturday (631) 267-0105.</p>
        <p>Come Aug. 11 and yet another entity makes its appearance: the Long Island Shakespeare Festival bows at Suffolk Community College. Organized and directed by the professionals who teach in the college's highly rated theater training program and featuring former students who are now in graduate schools or working in regional theater (including Gabriel Fazo of Holtsville, the winner of the 1996 National Irene Ryan Acting Competition at the Kennedy Center, as Romeo), the festival begins its debut season with an opening gala performance on Aug. 11, and then runs through Aug. 20 in the Shea Theater on the Seldon campus (631) 451-4163.</p>
        <p>Island Debut</p>
        <p>''Master Class,'' Terence McNally's Tony Award-winning play that recreates coaching sessions by Maria Callas conducted with young singers, makes its Long Island debut Friday at Hofstra University in Hempstead. Lorraine Serabian, a Hofstra graduate who was nominated for a Tony for her performance in ''Zorba,'' appears as Callas in this productions that runs through Aug. 20 at the Monroe Lecture Center Theater (516) 463-5672.</p>
        <p>Charitable Big Names</p>
        <p>Really big names do their bit for causes this week out east. Tomorrow in the ninth annual ''All for the Sea'' concert for marine and environmental science scholarships at Southampton College, Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band appear at 7:30 p.m. on the college athletic fields. Gates open at 5 p.m. (631) 287-8375. On Saturday the playwright Edward Albee and the director Robert Wilson do their bit for the LongHouse Reserve, Jack Lenor Larsen's museum-gardens, and the Watermill Center, Mr. Wilson's artistic research organization. The two will engage in a ''dialogue,'' which could mean anything from readings to just plain conversation, at 6 p.m. after a reception at 5 p.m. at the reserve on Hands Creek Road in East Hampton (631) 329-3568.</p>
        <p>Theater Readings</p>
        <p>For those who like to put their imaginations to work through staged readings, there are three to chose from this week. On Friday and Saturday, the Ivy Lane-Universal Players offer ''The Octette Bridge Club,'' P. J. Barry's comedy, at 8:30 p.m. at the Levitttown Library (516) 731-5728. The Playwrights Theater of East Hampton finishes its season of works-in-progress with ''Homesick,'' Tamar Cole's drama about a scholar with a ''terrible secret,'' at 9 p.m. Friday and Saturday at the LTV Studio in Wainscott (631) 324-5373. Also on Friday, but at 8:30 p.m., the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center offers ''Karma Bommerang,'' Joe Pintauro's new work starring Mercedes Ruehl and Roy Scheider. The center, incidentally, returns to more conventional uncoventional theater on Saturday with ''Eyecons,'' the female impersonator Christopher Peterson's satirical look at such legendary ladies of show business as Joan Rivers, Barbra Streisand, Judy Garland and Julie Andrews (631) 288-1500.</p>
        <p>Permanent Exhibitions</p>
        <p>On Saturday, the Museums at Stony Brook open two new permanent exhibitions. ''A Trip to Yesterday: Long Island in the Carriage Era,'' which employs some of the museums' more than 100 horse-drawn carriages to replicate part of turn-of-the-century Stony Brook, takes over the Carriage Museum. The History Museum opens ''The Bayman's Art: Wildfowl of Long Island,'' a gallery that displays decoys in such environmental settings as wetlands, a salt-marsh diorama, an early 20th-century bayman's workshop and a preserved North Shore duck boat. The museums are on Route 25A (631) 751-0066.</p>
        <p>Heritage Festival</p>
        <p>The Nassau County Office of Cultural Development stages its annual International Heritage Festival from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. next Sunday in and around Eisenhower Park's Lakeside Theater in East Meadow. Two outdoor stages will feature music by performers like Oscar Brand, the Platters, Sol y Sombra and the Adlib Steel Band; children's entertainment by Plaza Productions and the Crowations Puppets; ethnic foods; an international film festival; booths mounted by foreign nations; and a Civil War encampment (516) 571-8550.
