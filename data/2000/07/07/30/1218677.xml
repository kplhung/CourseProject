        <p>RONALD BELL JR. doesn't own the two-acre lot fronting Poospatuck Creek in Mastic; the land, like the rest of the Poospatuck Indian reservation, is held in common by members of the Unkechaug tribe. But the landscaping equipment stored on the lot is his. So is the blackened shell of a trailer home.</p>
        <p>The trailer was to be Mr. Bell's tax-free tobacco store until fire engulfed it at dawn on May 24.</p>
        <p>''My son woke me up. I smelled smoke and called 911,'' Mr. Bell, 33, a member of the Unkechaug Tribal Council, said in an interview outside his new store, the Poospatuck Indian Outpost on 130 Poospatuck Lane. It's the fifth smoke shop on the tiny Indian enclave. The new store is where the old one was -- right next to his mobile home, where he was sleeping when the fire erupted.</p>
        <p>''I looked out of the window and there were flames everywhere,'' he  recalled. ''The funny thing is, the building had no electricity in it yet. It just mysteriously caught on fire. I have no idea why.''</p>
        <p>The actual cause of the fire is no mystery. The Suffolk County police have ruled it an arson. It's the culprit and motive that are unclear. The county police and the F.B.I., which has jurisdiction on Indian reservations, aren't saying much about their investigations, but any list of theories would have to include the possibility that the arsonist was a rival Indian tobacco shop owner, or perhaps an off-reservation merchant angry that the Indian smoke shops' tax-free status was siphoning business away.</p>
        <p>This was the second fire of suspicious origin related to the discount cigarette business on the wooded 55-acre Poospatuck reservation, sovereign domain of the Unkechaug nation, one of two state-recognized Indian tribes on Long Island. The first blaze, on Feb. 9, destroyed a car belonging to Thomasina Mack, a tribal member who sells cigarettes from her home.</p>
        <p>Detective Lt. Charles Dohrenwend, commander of the arson squad of the Suffolk County police, said he was conducting an active investigation in both cases but had no suspects. He also noted that whoever set the two fires ''was not necessarily the same person.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mack said she had the approval of the Tribal Council to sell cigarettes from her home. But the Unkechaug chief, Harry Wallace, who opened the first smoke shop at the Poospatuck reservation nine years ago, said Mr. Bell had ''created controversy by opening a store. He's a member of the Tribal Council but he hasn't received council approval'' to sell tobacco products at his shop.</p>
        <p>''It's an assumption that a competitor did it, but I don't believe it,'' added Mr. Wallace, 47, who is also a lawyer. ''I don't believe any tribal member did it, but there is an F.B.I. investigation going on. I think this has to do with outside influences trying to disrupt the orderly flow of our government.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell, a landscape contractor who operates the smoke shop with his brother Tyrone and sister Anna, acknowledged that he had not received permission from the Tribal Council and noted that the other four smoke shop operators on the reservation had questioned his entry into the business. But, he said, ''I collected 68 signatures from half of the residents here and that's approval according to our bylaws. The council governs the reservation, but the people have the last word.''</p>
        <p>He also said that the state tax increase on March 1, nearly doubling the tax to $1.11 per pack or $11.10 a carton, had made the reservation's tax-free tobacco more attractive, fostering competition among tribal smoke shop entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>''Certain individuals want to have a monopoly on the cigarette sales on the reservation,'' Mr. Bell said. ''When you jump into that, you're taking money from them.''</p>
        <p>The brothers Rodney and James Magee, operators of the Smoke Signals tobacco store next to his, sought an injunction in state Supreme Court in Riverhead to block the opening of his store last month, claiming it represented a financial hardship to them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell said he was ''$80,000 in the hole'' as a result of the fire and the legal battle with his neighbors.</p>
        <p>He said that after three weeks at his reopened store, sales amount to about 100 cartons a week from walk-in customers. Mr. Bell also has an Internet site which, he said, is not entirely up to speed and could be affected by state legislation, which awaits the signature of Governor Pataki, to ban common carriers like United Parcel Service from delivering tobacco products to homes. Its supporters say the bill would curtail cigarette bootlegging and sales to minors who shop via the Internet.</p>
        <p>The Indian smoke shops are also threatened by a 1995 lawsuit by the New York Association of Convenience Stores, a trade group with about 6,000 members across the state, which is seeking to compel the state Department of Taxation and Finance to collect taxes from non-Indian purchasers of tobacco products on the state's nine Indian reservations. The trade group lost its latest round in New York Supreme Court; the case is now before the Appellate Division in Albany, said James Calvin, the group's president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Calvin said members of his organization had reported ''drop-offs in sales by 30 to 50 percent'' for tobacco products after the March tax increase, which made New York cigarettes the most heavily taxed in the nation. Mr. Calvin said he suspects that droves of smokers are now going to reservations to take advantage of the $11.10-a-carton tax differential.</p>
        <p>''Since the tax increase, the price disparity between our stores, which are required to collect taxes, has drained customers away from stores to reservations,'' he said. ''Each time the state of New York has chosen to hike excise state sales taxes, the problem has gotten worse.''</p>
        <p>State officials have long claimed that sales of tax-free tobacco on Indian reservations cost New York more than $100 million a year in uncollected revenues. In 1997, Mr. Pataki attempted to fashion tax compacts with the state's tribes and imposed a blockade of shipments of motor fuel and tobacco products headed to upstate reservations. Native Americans and their supporters responded by disrupting traffic along the New York Thruway south of Buffalo, claiming the governor's actions violated Indian sovereignty and threatened economic development on the reservations. Mr. Pataki abandoned the campaign, a turnabout that still angers convenience store operators three years later.</p>
        <p>''If I got within a few feet of Pataki, I'd give him an earful,'' said Mike Cuomo, who operates Mike's One-Stop in Mastic Beach, three-quarters of a mile from the reservation. ''How can people evade taxes on such a scale with impunity?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo said he had to convert his business from a tobacco shop into a convenience store after Mr. Wallace opened the first smoke shop on the Poospatuck reservation in 1991.</p>
        <p>''My volume in cigarettes was 600 to 800 cartons a week,'' Mr. Cuomo said of the days before the Indian shops. ''Within six months I was down to 200 cartons a week. I had to make a huge bank loan and rent a larger space and turn it into a convenience store. I am still paying off a loan of $50,000.''</p>
        <p>Richard Tufariello said the Poos patuck smoke shops put his convenience store out of business in 1994. ''Their pricing put me in a position where I was no longer able to compete,'' he said. ''You can draw a 15-mile circle around any native shop and it is impossible for anyone counting on tobacco sales to compete.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallace dismissed the notion of tax-free Indian tobacco outlets as unfair competition.</p>
        <p>''There are 85 Indian smoke shops in the state of New York and 30,000 convenience stores,'' the chief said. ''Are you going to tell me 85 smoke shops are going to put 30,000 convenience stores out of business? They have all kinds of opportunities that we don't have. They have Lotto, magazines, sandwiches. We're off the beaten path. People have to look to find us.''</p>
        <p>Lance Gumbs, who owns the Shinnecock Indian Outpost, one of three stores selling tax-free tobacco on the 750-acre Shinnecock reservation in Southampton, said he didn't welcome the latest tobacco tax increase ''because any time there is a disparity, it brings us scrutiny we don't need. Indians should be left alone becaue this has been the status quo for years. It's not a taxation issue, it's an issue of sovereignty. There are treaties around the state that we have the right to free trade and commerce as long as the grass grows and the water flows.</p>
        <p>''We're operating within our sovereign rights as an Indian nation,'' Mr. Gumbs said. ''New York can't tell Connecticut to raise their taxes because people are running across the border to buy cigarettes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gumbs angrily disputed charges by Assemblyman Jeffrey Klein, a Bronx Democrat, who contended in June that bootleggers were going to Indian reservations to buy tax-free cigarettes ''by the truckloads'' for resale on the black market in New York City.</p>
        <p>''That's an outright, stone-faced lie,'' Mr. Gumbs said. ''Nobody's getting truckloads of cigarettes from Indian reservations. Where does he get his information? He lives in the Bronx. What reservations has he gone to and witnessed this happening? He's trying to say we're involved in smuggling and deceitful practices and that's just not true.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell claims he's not afraid after the fire that ruined his first store. ''We've got security,'' he said, adding that he is sure that the Unkechaugs will find whoever committed the arsons.</p>
        <p>''The reservation,'' he said, smiling, ''will deal with this in our own special way.''</p>
