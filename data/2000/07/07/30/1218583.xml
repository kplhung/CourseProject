        <p>Birding in Trinidad</p>
        <p>Q. My husband and I would like to go birding in Trinidad and Tobago. Can you help us find companies that organize such trips? -- Rachel Schmidt, St. Petersburg, Fla.</p>
        <p>A. The West Indian republic of Trinidad and Tobago is becoming increasingly popular among wildlife enthusiasts, particularly birders. The country's dense rain forests and mangrove swamps are teeming with  more than 400 species, including scarlet ibises, toucans, parrots, hummingbirds and yellow orioles.</p>
        <p>Nature Expeditions International, in Plantation, Fla., has an eight-day package for groups of two or more people, with weekly departures throughout the year. The itinerary includes four nights at the Asa Wright Nature Center and Lodge, a former coffee plantation on Trinidad that has been converted into an inn and a 200-acre nature reserve. Birding expeditions to the Caroni Bird Sanctuary on Trinidad's west coast and visits to waterfalls and swamps are among the activities. Three days are spent at Blue Waters Inn on  Tobago's Atlantic coast; from there you'll take a day trip to Little Tobago Island, a seabird breeding area. The price is $2,390 a person, double occupancy, excluding air fare. Information: (800) 869-0639.</p>
        <p>A similar eight-day package is offered by Caligo Ventures, based in Armonk, N.Y. Visitors stay at the Asa Wright Lodge and Blue Waters Inn; on Trinidad, they will take birding trips to Nariva Swamp and the Caroni Bird Sanctuary; outings on Tobago include visits to King's Bay, the island's mountainous forests and Little Tobago Island. Through Dec. 15, the cost is $1,525 a person, double occupancy, including air fare from Miami or New York; from Dec. 16 to March 31, 2001, the price is $1,895. Information: (800) 426-7781.</p>

        <p>Celebrating Chaucer</p>
        <p>Q. I'm going to England this fall and hope to attend some of the events associated with the 600th anniversary of Chaucer's death. Do you have a schedule of events? -- Howard W. Eden, Sacramento</p>
        <p>A. Exhibitions, performances, festivals and readings will commemorate the death in 1400 of the author of ''The Canterbury Tales.'' In some cases, details have not been made final, so it's best to check in early September with the organizers of the various events.</p>
        <p>Southwark in London was the starting point for the pilgrims' 60-mile journey to the Canterbury shrine of St. Thomas a Becket in ''The Canterbury Tales,'' so it's fitting that this year's Southwark Literature Festival, from Oct. 26 to Nov. 3, will feature Chaucer's work. Readings and discussions are planned, and on Oct. 26, at Southwark Cathedral, George Dyson's cantata ''The Canterbury Pilgrims'' will be performed, at a time to be announced. Information: (44-20) 7403 7400.</p>
        <p>Chaucer's tomb, in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey, will be the site of a wreath-laying ceremony  at 5:30 p.m. on Oct. 25, with readings from Chaucer's writings. Information: (44-20) 7222 7110.</p>
        <p>In Canterbury, the two-week Canterbury Festival will open on Oct. 14 with a procession at 6:30 p.m. of actors playing Chaucer characters. Throughout the festival, modern  Canterbury Tales will be read by their authors at various places around Canterbury. Admission is  $7.45, at 67 pence to the dollar. Information: (44-1227) 452 853.</p>
        <p>Martin Starkie, a playwright, actor and director of the Chaucer Heritage Trust, will present a Chaucer-themed performance of mime, music and dance on Oct. 22 at 4:30 p.m. at the Chaucer Center at 22 St. Peter's Street in Canterbury. Information: (44-1227) 470 379.</p>
        <p>From Sept. 30 to Nov. 4, ''Passing Tales'' will be on view at the Royal Museum and Art Gallery on High Street in Canterbury. Highlights include a 16th-century portrait of Chaucer and late-medieval pilgrims' badges. The museum is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; closed Sunday. Admission is free. Information: (44-1227) 452 747.</p>
        <p>Visiting Goias Velho in Brazil</p>
        <p>Q. On a trip to central Brazil, I'd like to drive to Goias Velho from Goiania, where I'll be based. What are some of the principal sights there, and can you name a few hotels, in case I decide to spend the night? -- Catrina Rubinski, Rochester</p>
        <p>A. Goias Velho, about 90 miles northwest of Goiania and 125 miles west of Brasilia, is a former gold-mining town that served as the state capital of the state of Goias until 1937, when Goiania became the capital. The town is an architectural gem, with well-preserved colonial buildings, cobbled streets and lovely baroque churches like the Igreja de Paula on Praca Zaqueu Alves de Castro.</p>
        <p>Among the places worth visiting are the mid-18th century Conde dos Arcos Palace, 1 Praca Dr. Tasso de Camargo. Visitors can tour the ornate rooms, in which the original colonial furniture is on display. Open Tuesday to Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m,; Sunday from 8 a.m. to noon.  Entrance is 55 cents. Information:  (55-62) 371-1200.</p>
        <p>On the same block, the Sacred Art Museum in the Igreja da Boa Norte, contains an 18th-century collection of  carved wooden images. It is open Tuesday through Saturday from 12:30 p.m. to 5 p.m; Sunday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Entrance is also 55 cents. Information: (55-62) 321-1207.</p>
        <p>The Museu das Bandeiras, in a former government building on Praca Brasil Caiado, is dedicated to the 18th-century gold rush, with old mining implements and other exhibits. Hours are Tuesday to Saturday, noon to 5 p.m.; Sunday, 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.. Admission is 55 cents. Information: (55-62) 371-1087.</p>
        <p>The Vila Boa Hotel, Avenida Dr. Deusdete Ferreira de Moura, is a modern, two-story inn with 29 rooms. Doubles are $73 on weekends; $55 on weekdays. Information: (55-62) 371-1000.
