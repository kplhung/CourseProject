        <p>THE LAKE</p>
        <p>By Daniel Villasenor.</p>
        <p>Viking, $24.95.</p>
        <p>''You have a lot of school in you,'' Anna says to Zach, the glum hero of Daniel Villasenor's first novel. She's got that right. After 10 years of immersion in Nietzsche and Heidegger, Zach attempts suicide, crushed by philosophy's devotion to ''the hows of thought but not the whys and the wherefores.'' While on a cross-country road trip, he happens upon Anna in the Louisiana woods, where she cares for 11 children abandoned because of physical or mental illness. Zach becomes her 12th patient after his mouth is slit by a thief, but his essential sickness is spiritual, a lack of connection with the world and its people. To come back to life, he makes lists of objects, a therapy suggested by Michael Lazar, a 76-year-old shrink who argues that Zach, a victim of words, must fill the words with the things. Anna is Zach's antithesis; she practices herbal medicine and acupuncture learned from a ''leaf doctor'' and lives in a house that lacks clocks and mirrors. She also talks to her dead parents -- a father electrocuted when she was 15 and a mother who died giving her birth. How Anna moves past her anguish and Zach learns he is living ''in a body'' is the basis of a novel that is less story than monograph, despite random acts of violence. Readers may reasonably disagree whether Villasenor's intentional ambiguities, resolute lyricism and literary allusions are profound or merely precious.</p>
