        <p>AFTER 63 years, the 88-acre, 1.8-million-square-foot office and laboratory campus at Morris Avenue and River Road here is getting a new owner, but its use will not change, nor will its occupant -- at least not yet.</p>
        <p>On July 13, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation -- formed in 1997 from the merger of Ciba-Geigy's pharmaceutical division and Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation -- signed an agreement to sell the former Ciba-Geigy property in Summit to another pharmaceutical company, the Schering-Plough Corporation, headquartered in Madison. No one involved in the deal would disclose the sale price.</p>
        <p>Although it has sold the Summit property, Novartis has a lease agreement with Schering-Plough that allows it to occupy some of the 33 buildings on the site for the next three years while it constructs new buildings at the 188-acre former United States headquarters of Sandoz in East Hanover, which has become Novartis's United States headquarters. That campus, at Route 10 and Ridgedale Avenue, consists of 2 million square feet of space in 30 buildings constructed from 1950 to 1995, and a 50,000-square-foot lab is under construction.</p>
        <p>Now, Novartis intends to invest more than $100 million in its East Hanover expansion. To that end, it has plans to build a 500,000-square-foot research center and another office building of up to 75,000 square feet. The company also plans to add amenities, including a bigger cafeteria or a second one, and expand the utilities on site.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Schering-Plough will begin renovating some buildings on the Summit campus. It also plans to seek approvals to construct a new safety evaluation building, the size of which has yet to be determined. The property is expected to change hands by year's end.</p>
        <p>The deal between Novartis and Schering-Plough illustrates the reshuffling of space that is the result of the continuing consolidations, expansions and mergers in the pharmaceutical industry as companies look for new ways to compete in the race to develop new drugs. That much of the activity is taking place in New Jersey is not surprising, because the state is home to 191 pharmaceutical companies, including 15 of the largest drug makers in the world.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that the lifeblood of the industry is research and development,'' said William H. Tremayne, president of the HealthCare Institute, a nonprofit trade group in New Brunswick. ''Nationally, drug companies last year invested 20 percent of their gross revenues in R &amp; D,'' he said, and New Jersey firms spent $1.2 billion on capital improvements in 1998, most of it for research and development facilities.</p>
        <p>For Novartis, which spent $2.8 billion last year on research and development, and Schering-Plough, which spent $1.2 billion, the sale of the Summit campus is a way for the companies to meet their growth needs and expand their research functions.</p>
        <p>RANDY DIAS, the executive director of regional project engineering at Novartis, said that by selling the Summit campus, ''we will be able to consolidate our New Jersey operations, especially research functions, on one campus.'' In turn, the company will gain ''synergies'' as well as reduce costs by about $30 million a year, he said. In 1998, the company consolidated its manufacturing operations on its 140-acre campus in Suffern, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dias said the East Hanover campus was chosen for the research office consolidation because it can accommodate up to four million additional square feet of offices and labs. The plan, he said, is to relocate most of the 800 people, including 520 scientists, who work in Summit for Novartis Pharmaceuticals to the East Hanover campus. The Summit campus is also home to two other corporate entities, Novartis Consumer Health Organization and Novartis Corporation, with a combined 370 employees. The company has not decided where those workers will be moved.</p>
        <p>Denise Foy, a spokeswoman for Schering-Plough, said her company agreed to buy the property for several reasons. She said that while her company continues to expand at its Kenilworth and Union research campuses, ''there was certainly a need for additional space to meet its growing pharmaceutical research operations in New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>The fact that the Summit is close to Kenilworth and Union, is a key factor in the decision, she said. And Novartis's three-year lease will not affect Schering-Plough's expansion plans, she said.</p>
        <p>Christopher Kinum, a principal at the Garibaldi Group, Corfac International brokerage in Chatham, which represented Schering-Plough in the sale, added: ''It would have taken that long to construct a new building. And with the Summit campus, the company gets more buildings and a site they can add to to meet their short-, medium- and long-term needs.''</p>
        <p>Miss Foy said scientists and support workers would be among the initial employees to be relocated to Summit, starting in the second quarter of 2003. She said Schering-Plough had no plans to close the Kenilworth or Union campuses, or a third in Lafayette.</p>
        <p>The sale of the Summit campus ''will have a neutral or slight positive impact on the 11-county northern and central New Jersey office market,'' said Stephen P. Jenco, the research services manager at the Fairfield office of Grubb &amp; Ellis, the commercial brokerage company. The pharmaceutical industry's pending mergers will have a similar impact, he said.</p>
        <p>When Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham agreed to merge, there was speculation that the merged company would relocate its United States headquarters near Princeton. Instead, it has decided to keep its two headquarters, in Research Triangle Park, N.C., and Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>But the Pharmacia Corporation -- formed from the recent merger of Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn of Peapack and the Monsanto Company of St. Louis -- decided to expand in New Jersey. The company has leased a 115,000-square-foot building at the Somerset Financial Center on Route 206 in Bridgewater, and has an option to lease a second building there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jenco said the number of leases like Pharmacia's -- those of 100,000 square feet or more -- have increased as tenants of all types have expanded. That activity, he added, helped chip away at the market's vacancy rate, especially for prime office space, which had crept up as newly constructed buildings, like those at the Somerset Financial Center, came onto the market.</p>
        <p>His firm reported that the vacancy rate for prime space was 11.8 percent in the second quarter of this year, down from 15 percent in the first quarter and from 17 percent in the second quarter of 1999. In the last year, average asking rents for such space dropped to $28.45 a square foot annually, from $28.57.</p>
        <p>When the Summit campus came on the market in 1999, real estate professionals viewed it as a good alternative to new construction because the supply of large, well-located tracts of land is dwindling. Its laboratory buildings, a type of construction that is costly and takes a long time to build, were another draw, as was the fact that Novartis would continue to clean up contaminated ground water and remove petroleum hydrocarbon from the site.</p>
        <p>Those factors made the site appealing to developers and users, said Andrew J. Merin, an executive director at the East Rutherford office of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the brokerage and services firm, which represented Novartis in the transaction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Merin said the property was marketed as having the potential to be redeveloped into an office building or hotel. And once Novartis vacated the property, research buildings at the back of the site could be leased, Mr. Merin said.</p>
        <p>It did not turn out that way. Mr. Merin said most of the major pharmaceutical companies looked at the site before the deal was struck with Schering-Plough.</p>
        <p>The site is assessed at $202 million, according to Summit city officials, and while it was on the market, it was reportedly valued at $125 million to $300 million, including the value of Novartis's lease.</p>
        <p>Douglas Haynes, president of Alexander Summer Cresa, a commercial brokerage company based in Paramus, estimated the sale price at $200 million to $250 million. ''It is being sold for its highest and best use to a user who is willing to pay,'' Mr. Haynes said.</p>
