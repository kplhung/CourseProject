        <p>As Democrats pick apart the voting record of Richard Cheney, many pundits have wondered why George W. Bush picked a real conservative as his running mate. After all, they say, doesn't this selection belie his carefully honed image as the son and heir of the ''kinder, gentler'' president?</p>
        <p>First, let it be said that the senior Bush was not elected president because he offered the nation a ''kinder, gentler'' version of Reagan conservatism. He was elected because voters were, in effect, electing Ronald Reagan to a third term through his surrogate and because Mr. Bush wasn't Michael Dukakis.</p>

        <p>As Democrats pick apart the voting record of Richard Cheney, many pundits have wondered why George W. Bush picked a real conservative as his running mate. After all, they say, doesn't this selection belie his carefully honed image as the son and heir of the ''kinder, gentler'' president?</p>
        <p>First, let it be said that the senior Bush was not elected president because he offered the nation a ''kinder, gentler'' version of Reagan conservatism. He was elected because voters were, in effect, electing Ronald Reagan to a third term through his surrogate and because Mr. Bush wasn't Michael Dukakis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was defeated in 1992 for several reasons, but one, most assuredly, was that he had spent close to four years proving that he was not Ronald Reagan and didn't want to be Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>The second George Bush has a serious opportunity to be elected president only eight years after his father left office. But can he be swept into the White House on the wings of ''compassionate conservatism''? The slogan's meaning seems like a euphemism for moderate Republicanism. Certainly, for the mostly unhyphenated conservatives who make up the large Reagan wing of the party, the slogan has a vaguely negative connotation.</p>
        <p>Just as President Bush's ''kinder, gentler'' conservatism was a slap, intended or not, at Mr. Reagan and his policies, so is ''compassionate conservatism'' a slap, intended or not, at those Reagan conservatives who have kept the G.O.P. alive for the last 20 years.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush seemed to think the slogan would resonate among voters in much the same way the ''New Deal'' and ''Great Society'' did. Instead, its appeal appears to be limited to moderate Republicans already firmly in his camp and to a select group of disaffected Democrats fed up with the Clinton-Gore years and not willing to waste a vote on either Pat Buchanan or Ralph Nader.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush may sense this. A man who has twice won the Texas statehouse can be expected to have good political instincts. At any rate, Mr. Bush may have selected Mr. Cheney as his vice presidential running mate precisely because Mr. Cheney is not a compassionate conservative. He is a conservative plain and simple.</p>
        <p>His congressional record wins a 91 percent approval rating from the conservative American Constitutional Union, and the group says the rating  would be higher if Mr. Cheney had not voted for a few Reagan initiatives that it deemed too liberal. His tenure as defense secretary shows no hint of the social liberalism and experimentation that has dominated the Pentagon in the last eight years, nor is there any sign of moderation since he entered the business world. And even though he worked for both President Gerald Ford and President George Bush, he is viewed by Reaganites as one of theirs.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush and his allies are  playing down Mr. Cheney's conservative credentials and emphasizing his broad experience as an executive in government and in business.</p>
        <p>That doesn't quite wash. After all, other equally qualified, if moderate, candidates were available, and they might have brought more to the ticket. (One thinks of the oft-mentioned Tom Ridge, governor of Pennsylvania.) But selecting one of them would have validated the conservatives' fear that Mr. Bush's ''compassionate conservatism'' reveals, in truth, a moderate heart.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's selection goes a long way toward easing those fears, intensifying the support of conservative activists and rallying Reagan voters -- blue-collar workers, social conservatives and white ethnic voters -- once more to the Republican banner.</p>
        <p>So, it is with good reason that Mr. Bush picked a conservative as his running mate. Why in the world won't he admit that?</p>
