        <p>For the first summer in 23 years, the Whitthoff Civic Association's day camp is closed. And the parents of 350 children who would have attended are scrambling for an alternative.</p>
        <p>The camp, sponsored by the city's Department of Youth and Community Development, cost $125 for seven weeks and was usually held at Public School 34. But this year, there was no space at the school.</p>
        <p>Many of the parents say they cannot afford more expensive camps.</p>
        <p>''She's not really doing anything,'' Deborah Ruffin, a working mother,  said about her 5-year-old daughter, who spends the day at the home of a family friend. ''I was depending on that place.''</p>
        <p>The civic association requested classrooms at P.S. 34 in February and was told in June that the building would be unavailable. School District 29 offered rooms at Intermediate School 109, but rescinded the proposition two weeks before the school year ended. Then, two weeks after camp was to start, the district gave it space at P.S. 33, but only after inquiries by several City Council members.</p>
        <p>Terry Grady, head of community affairs for the district, said there was an unexpected increase in summer school enrollment, and that those students had to be accomodated before community-run programs.</p>
        <p>But Samuel Levine, the camp's educational coordinator, said the district has been trying to eliminate community-run programs, and deliberately withheld a camp site. He also said the civic organization had been targeted because it was demanding the return of $2,500 it erroneously paid to rent space for an after-school program in 1998.</p>
        <p>Margie Feinberg, spokeswoman for the Board of Education, said the district had no record of charging the civic organization $2,500 nor did it intend to sever ties with the group.</p>
        <p>''They've worked with Whitthoff in the past, and they look forward to working with them in the future,'' Ms. Feinberg said. ''They didn't mean anything by their actions. They were just focused on an expanded summer school program.''</p>
        <p>The director, Sonja Williams, said she has now lost most of her staff and cannot run the camp.</p>
        <p>''There was available space,'' Mrs. Williams said last week as she surveyed empty classrooms in a portable building at P.S. 34. ''I feel like they are trying to undercut all community-based organizations.''</p>
