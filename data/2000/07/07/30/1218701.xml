        <p>CASTLE VIEW lies off the beaten path of Route 22 here in Putnam County. But sometimes a detour is what it takes to find a bargain, and diners looking for generous portions at moderate prices will seek out this restaurant on Putnam Lake.</p>
        <p>Vacationers and residents alike have long been drawn to this hamlet, which retains the rustic atmosphere of the old summer communities that before air-conditioning dotted the landscape.</p>
        <p>The ambiguously named Castle View refers not to a view of a castle but rather to a castle with a view, a partial one of Putnam Lake.</p>
        <p>No pretense of this building's age should hold back the timid; despite its fortified exterior, the dining room and bar are neighborhood destinations -- casual and unpretentious.</p>
        <p>Huge, heavy doors at the entrance have a key that would have broken the back of the hardiest of chatelaines, and several suits of armor stand guard. Tiny gleaming miniature suits flank a fireplace that will probably make cozy work of dining here in winter.</p>
        <p>Although the lake view is not available to all tables, a view of the kitchen is. Behind the glass window, cooks bustle. And to judge from the style of the dishes, the kitchen very much wants to please.</p>
        <p>Bread arrived with red pepper butter, once sweet and fresh, once with refrigerator odor. But the bread was good and liberally employed in starters. Four slices of bruschetta al pomodoro were covered with fresh, creamy goat cheese and tomatoes, which could have been riper.</p>
        <p>And four slices came slathered with garlic butter, a companion to scampi-style shrimps, which were a tad dry, as was bacon-wrapped shrimp stuffed with mild horseradish, nonetheless a dish tasty from the bacon and a turn on the grill.</p>
        <p>A bowl of tender steamed clams bathed in wine, tomato and fresh herbs made a savory, more impressive opener. Fried calamari and a couple of crab cakes were standard issue begging for the zing of spicy heat (promised but omitted) in tomato dipping sauce.</p>
        <p>Some entrees could be shared. An order of lamb chops brought four thick double chops, well trimmed, cooked to order and plenty for sharing.</p>
        <p>Like nature, this kitchen seemed to abhor a vacuum; any space left on a plate was filled with potatoes and other vegetables -- all of them nicely prepared.</p>
        <p>Adorned with curlicues of fried onions, T-bone steak weighing in at more than 22 ounces ($23) proved tender, meaty and succulent. Almost as stunning, Tennessee filet mignon arrived in white mushroom sauce well laced with Jack Daniels.</p>
        <p>But the menu was not all turf. A crisp, delicate mesh of potato made an excellent nest for a thickness of juicy salmon drizzled with creamy, buttery citrus sauce. And big seared sea scallops wilted a bed of greens deliciously. Only swordfish was disappointing: mushy and watery, the chunk was scattered with ho-hum artichoke hearts, capers and bland domestic black olives.</p>
        <p>Skip dense bread pudding and the amateur fluff of chocolate-peanut butter cake for the best dessert in the house: ice cream.</p>
        <p>A half-dozen luscious flavors included caramel, black raspberry, vanilla malted and mint chocolate chip. Request an assortment.</p>
        <p>A three-course dinner averages $29 without drinks, tax and tip. Castle View is at the southwest corner of Putnam Lake. Call for directions, or from Route 22 northbound, take Route 65 onto Route 66 and turn left at the war memorial onto Haviland Drive.</p>
        <p>Castle View  173 Haviland Drive, Patterson,  (845) 279-5141.</p>
