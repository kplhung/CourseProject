        <p>Robert L Ferrante letter responds to July 24 front-page article on moving corporate headquarters to cities with lower cost of living; predicts such moves will make it harder to attract and retain top talent in tight labor market</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Renewed Corporate Wanderlust Puts a Quiet Brake on Salaries'' (front page, July 24) does not mention an important downside risk in moving corporate headquarters to cities with a lower cost of living.</p>
        <p>Wall Street may applaud the move, but many potential senior corporate staff candidates will give a Bronx cheer. While existing staff members may agree to a lateral move, top talent you might wish to recruit will decline. The best and brightest are still often found in the major markets that companies have fled, where salaries will remain well above the levels companies introduce once they move.</p>

        <p>In this tight labor market, companies need all the allure they can muster, and being based in a major market adds considerable recruiting power.</p>
