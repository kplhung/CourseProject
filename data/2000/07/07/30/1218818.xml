        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The statistic that 3 percent of all adults in the United States are under supervision of the criminal justice system (news article, July 25) on its face should be worrisome. But placed in context it is appalling.</p>
        <p>The United States incarcerates a greater percentage of its population than any other country. There are  more than two million people incarcerated here, or 25 percent of the population imprisoned worldwide.</p>

        <p>The statistic that 3 percent of all adults in the United States are under supervision of the criminal justice system (news article, July 25) on its face should be worrisome. But placed in context it is appalling.</p>
        <p>The United States incarcerates a greater percentage of its population than any other country. There are  more than two million people incarcerated here, or 25 percent of the population imprisoned worldwide.</p>
        <p>Since 1980 we have produced more prison cells than low-income housing units. And most new prisons are in rural Congressional districts -- in other words, a jobs program for rural, white residents who overwhelmingly vote Republican. This hardly places us in a moral position to criticize other countries for human rights abuses.</p>
