        <p>JAZZ is the result of the energy stored up in America, wrote George Gershwin in 1933. And if the exponential growth of enrollment in the Litchfield Jazz Festival Summer Music School is any indication -- not to mention the 15,000 fans expected at the festival itself Friday through next Sunday at the Goshen Fairgrounds -- jazz will never run out of power.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, the jazz school, which is held in conjunction with the Litchfield Jazz Festival, started with an enrollment of 32 day students for a one-week session in Goshen. The program has grown to 170 students ranging in age from 8 to 65, from 17 states, Iceland and Canada.</p>
        <p>Two years ago the school moved to Teikyo Post University in Waterbury for residential accommodations. Three-quarters of the students, whose average age is 16, are signed up for both weeks. Seventy-five percent of the students board.</p>
        <p>The driving force behind the festival is Vita Muir, who founded Litchfield Performing Arts Inc., 20 years ago. Five years ago, she got the festival going, and a year after that she and Mitchell Goldfeld, a music manager interested in education, co-founded the school. Both the festival and school have exploded in popularity and attendance.</p>
        <p>''It's exactly Vita's vision,'' said Vita Muir's 19-year-old daughter, Lindsey Muir, the school's assistant director.</p>
        <p>The school is open to anyone who can play an instrument and has a desire to play jazz; no one has ever been turned down because of financial need. There are no audition tapes to be sent in.</p>
        <p>''I had a lot of kids find us on the Internet this year and they printed out the application and sent it in,'' said Lindsey Muir, a music major at the University of Connecticut. She added that many of the students heard about the jazz school through their own music teachers.</p>
        <p>One of the best and most unusual aspects of the school is that the students and their combos perform at the Litchfield Jazz Festival. Last year, the students were so popular they caused a delay in the regular programming. That in itself attracts a higher level of student and dedication, said Mr. Goldfeld, now the school's director. The students also attend master classes each day of the festival.</p>
        <p>The artistic and music director of the school, Don Braden -- who performs in the festival with an 18-piece group called Don Braden's Really Big Band -- said, ''The school is for anyone who's interested in getting better in jazz.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Braden -- a tenor and soprano saxophonist, flutist, composer and arranger -- was the music supervisor for the ''Cosby'' show, has numerous recordings out on the RCA Victor label, and is an instructor of jazz saxophone at William Paterson University in New Jersey. Mr. Braden, an engineering major at Harvard, said he dropped out of college in the early 80's and went to New York City to see if he could make a go of it. ''I got a constant stream of work, so I stayed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Before arriving at Litchfield, Mr. Braden taught at the Jamey Aebersold Summer Jazz Workshop in Louisville, Ky., where he had gone as a boy.</p>
        <p>Upon arrival, the students play for the faculty and are placed in groups of similar ability. ''We call it assessment -- not audition,'' Mr. Goldfeld said, stressing the non-competitive environment. ''This year,'' he said, ''there are many saxophonists, but every year is different. Last year we were blessed with bass players. Each year you start with a clean slate, it's a new challenge.'' Mr. Goldfeld, who has an M.B.A. from the Wharton School, left an investment career to work in music management and play the piano.</p>
        <p>Once the combos are settled -- each has drums, bass, guitar, piano, sax and some brass and winds and in some cases a vocalist -- they come up with their own band names.</p>
        <p>Nadia Koski, a 16-year-old from Terryville, has gone to the camp every summer with her saxophone. Her combo is called Nadia and the Other Guys. ''It's fun and challenging,'' she said. ''Everything is really intense, like when they ask you to spit out a D-flat diminished chord with all the extensions. Today I had to transpose a song, learn it, then improvise on it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Koski said she especially enjoyed performing at the festival. ''It was so great,'' she said, ''you could display your talents and your combo and know you're representing your school.''</p>
        <p>The routine is combo coaching in the morning, followed by theory class, then lunch. The combos meet again, and later in the afternoon break up and go to master classes. There is down time but somebody is always playing, and anybody can jump in. During lunch, a 17-year-old from Baltimore waited until everyone was eating; then he settled in at the Steinway grand, dazzling everyone within earshot.</p>
        <p>With so many different kinds of jazz, what are the students taught?</p>
        <p>''We're focusing on modern jazz, including Latin jazz, but the main thing is to learn straight-ahead jazz,'' Mr. Braden said. ''It has all the harmonic and rhythmic material that will prepare them for other forms of music.''</p>
