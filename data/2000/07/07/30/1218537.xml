        <p>New York's City Hall has an equivalent to the Curse of the Bambino, which baseball fans will recognize as the evil spell supposedly cast on the Boston Red Sox for their cosmic sin of selling Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees in 1920. How else do you explain why the Bosox, try as they may, have been unable to win a World Series since 1918?</p>
        <p>The New York curse has proved even more enduring. It decrees, if you believe in such things, that no mayor of America's premier city will rise to higher office. Why this is so is anyone's guess. But it is a fact that an elected New York mayor has not made good beyond City Hall since the 1860's, when one Fernando Wood moved on to Congress.</p>
        <p>For a while this year, it looked as if Rudolph W. Giuliani might finally break that hex. No one thought that Giuliani's race for the United States Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton was a sure thing. But it was looking good.</p>
        <p>He had pumped himself up as a living legend. Far and wide, he was known as the man who cleaned up New York, who brought the crime rate to its lowest levels in two generations, who kicked deadbeats off the dole and preached the virtues of work over welfare, who turned budget deficits into surpluses, who cut taxes and watched private-sector jobs grow, who tossed the mob out of the fish market, who even tried to persuade New Yorkers that jaywalking was not a God-given right.</p>
        <p>O.K., he was not the most likable fellow around. He governed by fear, and he obsessively -- critics would say dictatorially -- hoarded information that should have been in the public domain. Disagree with him, even mildly, and he would denounce you as politically corrupt, intellectually dishonest or plain evil. He played fast and loose with the First Amendment so often that the courts had to rein him in time and again.</p>
        <p>Still, his record was generally sterling. And he had plenty of support, not only from New Yorkers but also from an army of Clinton loathers in the American heartland, ready to open their checkbooks to anyone who would send the first lady on her way to political oblivion.</p>
        <p>Then, out of nowhere, everything fell apart. Over a few dizzying weeks in early spring, Giuliani announced he had prostate cancer, disclosed he was separating from his wife and paraded around his new girlfriend. It was all so Oprah. The kicker came on May 19 when he announced that he was withdrawing from the Senate race.</p>
        <p>Poof! It was over. The City Hall curse had struck again. And now, on the heels of all this, we have two books that seem almost like flowers laid on his political crypt.</p>
        <p>Wayne Barrett's ''Rudy!'' and Andrew Kirtzman's ''Rudy Giuliani'' are different in style and approach. But both present Giuliani as fatally flawed, a man whose achievements are not nearly as dazzling as his press releases, whose effectiveness is undermined by ruthlessness and a compulsive need to hog the spotlight. You drink the Kool-Aid when Rudy tells you to, or you are gone, as some of his best and brightest have discovered.</p>
        <p>Kirtzman, who covers politics for New York 1, a local 24-hour cable news station, comes to these conclusions as much in sorrow as anger. He describes Giuliani's nearly seven years in office as riddled with missed opportunities and hobbled by his distrust of people. ''As a result,'' he writes, ''the most successful mayor in 50 years spent much of his reign alone and disconnected from the public. The tragedy of his mayoralty is that he could have accomplished so much more.'' Barrett, a formidable investigative reporter for The Village Voice, is from the slash-and-burn school. His Giuliani is an out-and-out fraud, whose life is a ''mesh of half-truths, double agendas and secrets.''</p>
        <p>Giuliani haters will undoubtedly feel vindicated by these books, people convinced he is a latter-day Savonarola. Just as surely, Giuliani lovers will be outraged, people convinced that blathering journalists have had it in for the mayor from the get-go. When it comes to this man, few are neutral. And in a sense, both sides will be right. The two books are, at once, enriched by their honesty and burdened by their anti-Giuliani agendas.</p>
        <p>What is surprising about both is that their subject, as dominating a force as New York has ever known, is not always a clearly defined figure. It is almost as if he were wrapped in gauze. That is probably not the writers' fault. Giuliani, true to his untrusting nature, made himself available to neither. So they were forced to look at him from a slight distance, through interviews with others, newspaper clippings and television footage. The City Hall freeze-out shows.</p>
        <p>Of the two mayoral pursuers, Barrett is the more relentless, which is not surprising. Stalking political game is his trade, and he plows through mounds of statistics to pick apart every aspect of Giuliani's career. The vaunted declines in New York crime reflected national trends, he finds, or began under the previous mayor (and Giuliani nemesis), David N. Dinkins. As the United States attorney in Manhattan in the 1980's, he says, Giuliani was less a courtroom wizard than a master of ''staged shtick.'' If streets are cleaner on Giuliani's watch, give thanks to private groups like the city's business improvement districts. Barrett even debunks a seminal Giuliani tale of how he was a boyhood martyr to his cherished Yankees, bravely enduring physical and verbal abuse from his Dodger-loving Brooklyn neighbors.</p>
        <p>Barrett's knack for mining official records enabled him, with his assistant, Adam Fifield, to strike investigative gold. He discovered that Giuliani's father, Harold, had spent a year and four months in prison, in the 1930's, for the armed stickup of a milkman. The mayor, it seems, also had an uncle who ran a loan-shark operation out of his bar and restaurant (with occasional leg-breaking help from Harold), a mob-connected cousin who was shot to death by federal agents and another cousin who died a junkie.</p>
        <p>Is any of this important? Does it rise above cheap sensationalism? Those questions have been asked since the Barrett revelations exploded in tabloid headlines several weeks ago. Fair enough. But it is hard to see how a biographer can ignore family background, especially with someone like Mayor Giuliani, who has talked repeatedly about how pivotal his father was for him. Lecturing welfare clients on the value of hard labor, he has often cited Harold Giuliani's work ethic as a case in point. In reality, Barrett reports, the elder Giuliani rarely held a steady job.</p>
        <p>Armchair shrinks may have a field day with this material, which includes a psychiatrist's report on Harold Giuliani, prepared just before he went to prison. It found him to be ''egocentric to an extent where he has failed to consider the feelings and rights of others.'' Many critics of the son will find those words fascinating. They have said much the same about him.</p>
        <p>We are now veering toward the realm of psycho-hooey. Still, it seems relevant that Rudy Giuliani, so publicly contemptuous of people who have had brushes with the law, comes from a clan stocked with such characters. (It is also curious that background checks did not reveal these details when Giuliani became an associate attorney general and then United States attorney during the Reagan administration.)</p>
        <p>Family history, for Barrett, helps explain what he regards as Giuliani's original sin: his seemingly scant empathy for blacks. The mayor, though born in Brooklyn, grew up in insulated white enclaves on Long Island. He was educated in Roman Catholic schools where blacks -- and Hispanics, for that matter -- were few.</p>
        <p>It is no surprise to Barrett, then, that blacks have been scarce in the upper reaches of the Giuliani administration. Or that the mayor has had trouble understanding why, if the searches bolster his fight against crime, many black men resent being stopped and frisked by the police, often for no apparent reason other than their color. Or that some of Giuliani's early budget cuts fell hardest on welfare, day care, Medicaid and schools -- services whose clients are mostly members of minority groups. ''His budget,'' Barrett writes, ''was a color-coded stacked deck.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, ''stacked deck'' might also apply to this book. As admirably dogged as Barrett's reporting is, he undermines it with a polemical writing style. To hear him tell it, virtually nothing that Giuliani has done is good or motivated by honor. The mayor is as villainous here as he was heroic in ''City for Sale,'' a tale of municipal scandals that Barrett wrote with Jack Newfield 11 years ago. ''Rudy!'' reads at times like a mea culpa for the earlier book. And as a distraught penitent, Barrett can slip into verbal overdrive. After losing to Dinkins the first time out, in 1989, Giuliani goes about ''plotting a democratic coup.'' In this country, we call that planning to run for office.</p>
        <p>Kirtzman's language is more temperate and balanced, though his distaste for the mayor's brutal excesses could not be plainer. ''Rudy Giuliani on a personal basis could be warm, wise and open-minded,'' he writes. ''The man the public saw, on the other hand, was often ruthless and seemingly eager to destroy anyone who got in his way.'' This dichotomy frustrated even people who worked closely with Giuliani, Kirtzman informs us.</p>
        <p>Like Barrett, he finds the mayor to be tone-deaf, at best, on racial matters. He is also appalled by the way Giuliani aides went around digging up dirt on Dinkins and Koch -- really unsavory personal stuff. The mayor, who to this day admonishes reporters to mind their own business and stay out of his private life, comes across as pitching stones from his glass house. ''For a man who claimed the moral high ground, Giuliani kept in close proximity to people who practiced the art of the smear,'' Kirtzman says.</p>
        <p>His book focuses less on the Giuliani family than on campaign nuts and bolts and on City Hall intrigue. It may take a love of political inside baseball to get worked up over the struggles for supremacy between Deputy Mayors Fran Reiter and Peter Powers or even, though her story is sexier, the rise and fall of Cristyne Lategano, referred to by colleagues as the Dragon Lady of City Hall.</p>
        <p>A ll the same, rewarding details abound. We are told that the Rev. Al Sharpton, Giuliani-basher supremo, made overtures to the Giuliani campaigns in both the 1989 and 1993 elections. In 1989, Kirtzman says, Sharpton went so far as to supply the Giuliani camp with ''intelligence picked up from the streets.'' Not surprisingly, Sharpton denies all this. In the past, he has also denied reports that he used to inform on prominent blacks for the F.B.I.</p>
        <p>One Kirtzman story that resonates is a meeting that Giuliani and a top aide had in early 1999 with the Rev. Floyd Flake, a former Congressman from Queens. This came at the height of the crisis over the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed African immigrant killed in a barrage of 41 bullets.</p>
        <p>Flake was a rarity, a black Democrat who had crossed party (and racial) lines to endorse the Republican Giuliani for re-election in 1997. But now he was deeply troubled by the mayor's inability to understand why so many New Yorkers were infuriated by the innocent Diallo's terrible, undeserved fate. And he could no longer contain himself. ''I think you're just mean,'' he said to Giuliani. ''You've got a mean streak in you.''</p>
        <p>He may not want to hear that, but surely the mayor knows that this is how he is widely perceived, even by many who feel the city is a better place thanks to him. Since quitting the Senate race, he has toned down the tough-guy act and shown a softer, more reflective side. Maybe some day another book will emerge, showing more of this humbler Rudy, a counterpoint to the vindictive, self-aggrandizing character presented to us here. And don't forget, despite all he has gone through this year, he is still a force to reckon with. Who is to say that he can't yet beat that City Hall curse?</p>
