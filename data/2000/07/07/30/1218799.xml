        <p>NOON. Men's room, Port Authority.</p>
        <p>It's 45 minutes before my first interview in New York City. And as I quickly slip into the linen pants of my new suit I realize: I have no shoes. I forgot to pack them. Looking down at my feet, I see chewed-up tennis sneakers.</p>

        <p>NOON. Men's room, Port Authority.</p>
        <p>It's 45 minutes before my first interview in New York City. And as I quickly slip into the linen pants of my new suit I realize: I have no shoes. I forgot to pack them. Looking down at my feet, I see chewed-up tennis sneakers.</p>
        <p>I plan to move to New York for the summer. I have come for work, an internship really. I look forward to opening mail for The New Yorker. And today we will be clinking glasses and toasting my literary career over lunch, perhaps at the Algonquin Round Table.</p>
        <p>My friends are all off somewhere: playing kickball as camp counselors, collapsing on their parents' couches, content for the summer of cable, catnaps and no college. Waiting to get famous.</p>
        <p>I have come here to test my luck like so many before me.</p>
        <p>And now, 40 minutes before my interview, I have no shoes.</p>
        <p>12:05 P.M. -- Street corner, 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue.</p>
        <p>The pear-shaped man hiding behind The National Enquirer doesn't know where to find shoes around here.</p>
        <p>Peering around the pages, he looks at me, shrugs, spits, hands me the tabloid and leaves. Tucking the tabloid into my bag, I ask an aristocratic-looking woman.</p>
        <p>''Try Saks Fifth Avenue, darling,'' she whispers hoarsely. ''It's only a few blocks from here.''</p>
        <p>12:15 P.M. -- Saks Fifth Avenue, Men's Shoes, sixth floor.</p>
        <p>Seven blocks to be precise, lady. Seven. Three avenues to match.</p>
        <p>It's hot. My bags are heavy. I can't afford anything.</p>
        <p>12:20 P.M. -- Somewhere on Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>I try another store, Cole-Haan maybe. I can't find the entrance.</p>
        <p>12:21 P.M. -- Inside the store.</p>
        <p>Still too expensive.</p>
        <p>12:25 P.M. -- Shoe store next door.</p>
        <p>Can anyone help me?</p>
        <p>12:30 P.M. -- Jogging down Fifth Avenue in two new beige buckskin loafers, size 11 1/2.</p>
        <p>I feel a blister. They didn't have my size, or the size above my size. At least I have shoes. Most of my money is gone.</p>
        <p>2:15 P.M. -- Sucelt Coffee Shop, 14th Street and Seventh Avenue.</p>
        <p>''Great shoes!'' says Kevin Conley, a New Yorker restaurant reviewer. ''Bucks, eh? I think I might have to get a pair of those.''</p>
        <p>The New Yorker pays for the lunch, which is good because I don't have $7 to cover my rice and beans. As for my internship, I got it. They need the help. If I want the job, it's mine, they say. Just go in, find out when to start. Everything is perfect.</p>
        <p>2:30 P.M. -- Outside a hyper-modern cubicle at the New Yorker offices, eighth floor. Conde Nast building, Times Square.</p>
        <p>''It kills me to tell you this,'' says the editor I had been waiting months to see, ''but we've already hired all our paid interns for the summer. Sorry. Maybe next summer.''</p>
        <p>Everything is not perfect.</p>
        <p>''By the way,'' he goes on. ''Those are really great shoes. I think you've renewed my interest in bucks.''</p>
        <p>You're welcome.</p>
        <p>2:50 P.M. -- Back at the shoe store where I bought the beige bucks.</p>
        <p>''Can I please return these?'' They take them back. They even fished out my old sneakers from the garbage. I stick my feet into them. They feel like slippers. I have money again.</p>
        <p>3:15 P.M. -- Central Park.</p>
        <p>No more job. No more shoes. I watch the sky for a prospect to fall: an afternoon flash of fortune. If I cannot find a worthy job by tomorrow, I think I will go home to Binghamton.</p>
        <p>Maybe the newspaper will hire me to cover the cow pastures, or I could just drive the ice cream truck again, like last summer.</p>
        <p>4:10 P.M. -- I fall in love.</p>
        <p>4:11 P.M. -- I fall out of love.</p>
        <p>3:25 A.M. -- Coyote Ugly Bar, East Ninth Street and First Avenue.</p>
        <p>I stashed tomorrow's bus fare, $30, in the sweaty sock stuck to my blistery right foot. Willie Nelson's on the juke now, and flowin' down Whiskey River are 25 surly men, pounding their fist down into the oak bar, in hee-haw rhythm,</p>
        <p>''Whiskey River take my mind,/Don't let her mem'ry torture me.''</p>
        <p>9 A.M. -- Curled up on my cousin Lena's couch.</p>
        <p>I wake up. Back to sleep.</p>
        <p>11:45 A.M. -- The same couch.</p>
        <p>My bus leaves in an hour. Jobless, I wade through my duffle wanting dark, gritty coffee. My toothbrush comes up instead. I read The National Enquirer for the first time. I like it. It's honest, like Las Vegas architecture. It's what people  really want to read. Flipping through pitches for snake oil charms and weight-loss gimmicks (a pound a minute), criminalizing deer-in-the-headlight photos, alien spottings, I thought to myself. . . .</p>
        <p>NOON. -- On the phone in boxer shorts.</p>
        <p>''Is this The National Enquirer?''</p>
        <p>''No, this is Barry Levine. I'm the executive editor of The National Enquirer.''</p>
        <p>12:10 P.M. -- ''Come on over and bring some clips, but hurry up,'' Barry Levine says. ''We'll see what we can do.''</p>
        <p>12:11 P.M. -- I help my suit up from the pile it spent the night in.</p>
        <p>I look in the mirror. I smile, I dance.</p>
        <p>12:12 P.M. -- I look down at my feet.</p>
        <p>FIRST PERSON Geoffrey Gray is working on a memoir titled ''How to Sell Ice Cream.'' He is living on his cousin's couch on East 27th Street.</p>
