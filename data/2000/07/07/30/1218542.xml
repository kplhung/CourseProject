        <p>Vaclav Havel</p>
        <p>A Political Tragedy in Six Acts.</p>
        <p>By John Keane.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 532 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Basic Books. $27.50.</p>
        <p>When Vaclav Havel took up residence in Prague Castle in 1989, it seemed like the ending of a late-20th-century fairy tale. Since the 1960's Havel, the playwright and outspoken dissident, had exhorted his fellow citizens to ''live in truth'' -- to refuse to allow Czechoslovakia's Communist authorities to manipulate them into silence, complicity and passivity. For Havel, a life in truth had resulted in multiple prison sentences until finally, to the world's amazement, it won him the Czechoslovak presidency.</p>
        <p>John Keane writes in his unauthorized biography of Havel that the castle, at the time of Havel's accession, was ''a completely enclosed space bathed in sheer darkness,'' a ''morbid dungeon'' blanketed with dust, cluttered with Communist Party brochures and tastelessly outfitted with mirrored ceilings and oversized furniture. In moved Havel and his troupe of actors, advisers and friends. Suddenly, contemporary art and lighthearted frescoes adorned the walls; Philip Roth, the Rolling Stones and Lou Reed paid official visits; and the new president navigated the long corridors on a scooter.</p>
        <p>The euphoria of Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution, during which intellectuals and activists peacefully transformed a grim Soviet satellite into a vibrant democracy, was not to last forever. Soon the strains of discord between Czech and Slovak leaders would cleave the federation in two. And soon, Havel's reservations notwithstanding, the Czech Republic would be catapulted into the new neo-liberal world order.</p>
        <p>Vaclav Havel remains an international icon of integrity, wisdom and moral seriousness. But in his own country, Keane writes, many citizens think less of their president than they once did. ''Some say that he is hindering the process of consolidating good government, or that he is too ill to be a statesman. More than a few have been calling for his resignation.'' To Keane, such developments signal the closing act of a protracted and grand political tragedy, whose cast of characters includes everyone from Hitler and Stalin to Havel's band of writers and philosophers, mistresses and friends. This curtain call hardly compares to the deliverance of the young First Republic into the hands of the Nazis in 1939, or the crushing of the Prague Spring in 1968. And Havel, despite all indications to the contrary at the time of Keane's writing, has survived his battle with lung cancer. But as Keane sees it, the myth of Czechoslovakia's new patron saint has lost its luster -- indeed, if it hasn't, in Keane's view, it should. ''I have never believed in heroes,'' he declares, ''and I certainly never became interested in Havel and his work because I thought of him as a hero.''</p>
        <p>Born to a wealthy Prague family in 1936, Vaclav Havel, as Keane describes him, was a veritable Young Prince. His father owned Prague's cliff-top Barrandov suburb, replete with the city's finest cinemas. After the Communists seized power in 1948, however, young Vaclav was expelled as a class enemy from his elite private school. His mother, Bozena Havlova, the strong-minded daughter of an ambassador and journalist, continued to stoke her son's intellectual and artistic ambitions. It was she who encouraged the 16-year-old Havel to convene his first literary circle. Known as the Thirty-Sixers, after the year of its members' birth, the group met to discuss philosophical problems and forbidden books, and it published a samizdat journal of its own.</p>
        <p>Havel was a chubby and awkward child, nicknamed ''chrobak'' after ''a type of cumbersome beetle.'' Although female Thirty-Sixers admired Havel's intellect, one told Keane that the future president ''had about as much sex appeal and sex awareness as a bear cub.'' When his fellow Thirty-Sixer Jiri Paukert first met him, Havel was lying in bed. '' 'I had imagined him as a dark-haired Eugene Onegin type,' said his new friend for life. Instead, there lay 'a plaster-white-faced, reddish-tinged, blond-haired Ilya Ilyich Oblomov, fatally hesitating to decide whether or not it made any sense at all to get out of bed, just as noon approached.' ''</p>
        <p>But Havel was not the shy, retiring sort. Keane has unearthed Havel's one-year assessment of the Thirty-Sixers' activities -- a document that reads ''a bit like the carefully composed memorandum of a (potentially) domineering party-political whip urging his comrades to raise their consciousness, to work harder and more efficiently.'' The Thirty-Sixers, Havel was certain, were to become ''the crystallized core of a future movement, the work of the young, a political and cultural movement!''</p>
        <p>A decade later, Havel's absurdist play, ''The Garden Party,'' would indeed mark the dawn of a new literary movement in Prague -- one that would resist the strictures of Socialist Realism in favor of dark, subversive comedy in the manner of Ionesco and Beckett. And by the spring of 1968, Havel and his wife, Olga, found themselves at the center of Czechoslovakia's burgeoning counterculture. The Havels bought a small farm near the Polish border, where they entertained an endless stream of friends. ''We were self-confident, rebellious and intensely happy,'' one frequent guest told Keane.</p>
        <p>Czechoslovakia's Communist Party, meanwhile, had turned over the reins to Alexander Dubcek, a liberal reformer who presided over a flowering of political and cultural openness known as the Prague Spring. In the end, Dubcek's efforts were rewarded with an invasion by Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces. Forced to capitulate, he delivered a radio address ''punctuated by long lapses and loud sobbing.''</p>
        <p>Despite the destruction of the Prague Spring, Havel would soon find himself at the vanguard of another movement -- this time, Charter 77, which called for freedom of expression and association. Under constant surveillance and threat of imprisonment, he wrote his most famous political essay, ''The Power of the Powerless,'' in which he called upon ordinary citizens to live in truth -- to behave as though they were free and resist the lies of the state. Shortly after publishing the essay, Havel landed in prison for four years.</p>
        <p>In 1989, five years after Havel's release, popular demonstrations brought down the Czechoslovak government. Dubcek, Keane contends, was the obvious choice for the country's transitional presidency -- but Havel manipulated Dubcek into stepping aside, by promising to support him in the upcoming free elections. According to Keane, Havel broke that promise, betraying Dubcek and retaining the presidency for himself. Not long afterward, Czechoslovakia split. Keane strongly implies that Havel could have prevented the velvet divorce, but he never makes it clear exactly how.</p>
        <p>At times, Keane's insistence that Havel, popularly viewed as a reluctant ruler, has always sought a leadership role seems to rest on little more than informed conjecture. But presidencies are not, after all, freak accidents, and it is not unreasonable to view Havel's rise to power as the result of personal choices. With frequent reference to the Romantic poet and philosopher Novalis, Keane argues that Havel has sought to establish a ''crowned republic,'' of which he would be both monarch and muse, serving as an artistic and civic inspiration to his people. Not Machiavelli's fear but Novalis's ''faith and love'' would then bind the Czech people to their leader. Keane captures here both Havel's high-mindedness and the touch of elitism, even paternalism, that accompanies his sense of moral mission. It is perhaps the most original insight Keane brings to bear on his subject's life and work.</p>
        <p>For the most part, unfortunately, ''Vaclav Havel'' sags under the weight of Keane's ambitions. The author's stated intent is not only to tell the story of Havel's life, and to fashion that story into the unlikely form of a tragedy, but to provide a ''manual for democrats.'' The narrative is constantly interrupted by bombastic disquisitions on birth (''a vital moment of beginning''), death (''no laughing matter'') and other lofty themes.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Keane leaves some of the major threads of Havel's personal life dangling: the death of Olga, Havel's wife of 45 years and a major figure in the earlier chapters, is appended as an afterthought to a chapter on Havel's second marriage to a young actress. The death of his parents is not even mentioned, although he was very close to them as a child. On the other hand, Havel's own death occupies an entire tasteless chapter: although the Czech president is still alive, Keane concludes his book with a vividly imagined account of Havel's funeral. That Keane should end his biography on this note is the surest sign that our narrator cannot entirely be trusted. A tragedy, after all, should end with a funeral. A biography of a living person should not.</p>
