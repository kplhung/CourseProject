        <p>Dr. Robert George Crowder, an experimental psychologist and an authority on memory, died Thursday at his home in Hamden, Conn. He was 60.</p>
        <p>Dr. Crowder gained wide recognition in 1976 with the graduate textbook ''Principles of Learning and Memory,'' which summarized the research done on the matter.</p>
        <p>The book remains in print and until recently he was working on an updated edition.</p>
        <p>He also was author, along with Richard K. Wagner, of ''The Psychology of Reading: An Introduction.'' A contributor of numerous articles and book chapters, he was an editor, along with Frank R. Schab, of ''Memory for Odors.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Crowder joined the faculty at Yale as a lecturer in 1965, was promoted to full professor of psychology in 1976 and retired from active teaching two years ago because of his failing health.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife of 28 years, Julie Butterfield Crowder; two sons, Edward and Bruce, both of New Haven; a daughter, Lorial Crowder of Boston; and a half-bother, David L. Crowder of Seattle.</p>
