        <p>Whether scrambling away from defenders or bowling into the end zone, Steve Young, the quick-footed quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, never could keep still. Now he is retired, and moving faster than ever.</p>
        <p>A day after he bid farewell to football in mid-June, Mr. Young was drafted again, this time for the board of Flexpoint, a company based in Salt Lake City that makes sensors for cars and toys. Before the week was up, Mr. Young gleefully talked about expanding his role as chairman of Found.com, a somewhat obscure e-marketplace based in San Francisco, in which he was the first investor.</p>
        <p>Two weeks later, the news spread that Mr. Young had teamed up with Novell's former senior vice president and general counsel, David Bradford, to form FirstLight Venture Capital, a technology investment firm. The N.F.L.'s greatest running quarterback, who once tossed paychecks into a sock drawer and kept signing bonuses crumpled in a jeans pocket, was dashing head first into the new economy.</p>
        <p>But perhaps just a little too quickly. Mr. Young's associates say the FirstLight announcement came prematurely, before plans for the new company were final. Talks concerning the new venture continued last week.</p>
