        <p>The horror writer Stephen King became the first major author to self-publish over the Internet when he released the first chapter of a serial novel called ''The Plant,'' about a vine that terrorizes a publishing house.</p>
        <p>Mr. King's previous electronic book, the novella ''Riding the Bullet,'' drew 400,000 orders in the first 24 hours after Simon &amp; Schuster published it in March. This time Mr. King is cutting out his publisher, hoping to break new ground for less commercially successful authors. Using a honor system, he is asking $1 for the first chapter and for each monthly installment. He will stop writing unless 75 percent of the downloaders pay, leaving fans in suspense.</p>

        <p>The horror writer Stephen King became the first major author to self-publish over the Internet when he released the first chapter of a serial novel called ''The Plant,'' about a vine that terrorizes a publishing house.</p>
        <p>Mr. King's previous electronic book, the novella ''Riding the Bullet,'' drew 400,000 orders in the first 24 hours after Simon &amp; Schuster published it in March. This time Mr. King is cutting out his publisher, hoping to break new ground for less commercially successful authors. Using a honor system, he is asking $1 for the first chapter and for each monthly installment. He will stop writing unless 75 percent of the downloaders pay, leaving fans in suspense.</p>
        <p>So far 41,000 copies of chapter one were downloaded the first day it appeared. That is far less than the initial demand for his novella, which had Simon &amp; Schuster's advance marketing behind it. But it is still more than most titles sell in a year. Mr. King will post another tally this weekend. So far more than 75 percent of the readers are paying; Amazon.com is collecting. An envelope mistakenly arriving at Mr. King's office was addressed only: ''Stephen King, Rich Writer, Bangor, Maine.'' Inside was a check for $5. The return address: ''Satisfied Downloader.''</p>
