        <p>Editorial applauds recent signs that businesses have begun to discover value of hiring or retaining older workers</p>

        <p>Here and there, American businesses have begun to discover the value of hiring or retraining older workers. In some cases, those placements have been for specialized, high-income jobs -- as in the financial services sector, where companies like New York Life and Salomon Brothers Asset Management have begun hiring more salespeople over 50, in part because their age may give them an edge in a world where two-thirds of the money in the stock market is controlled by managers over 50. Other placements have been for specialized, low-income jobs, like the 100 women, average age 71, hired by Bonnie Bell to package lip gloss. They replaced a group of younger, less reliable temporary workers.</p>
        <p>It is so far a tiny trend. But the reasons for it are big and growing, and the nation's employers need to learn from them. The unemployment rate has been hovering around 4 percent in recent months. The tight labor market, which has created intense competition for qualified employees at every level, may not be a fluke but a new reality. That is because it stems not just from a growing economy, and an older work force that has been retiring at progressively younger ages, but from a shrinking number of young workers, too. Thanks to lower birth rates, there are simply fewer young people available to fill new jobs. Within four years, for the first time in American history, there will be fewer people aged 20 to 29 in the population than people 55 to 69. The gap will grow. By 2020, the younger group may be 40 percent smaller than the older one.</p>

        <p>It is so far a tiny trend. But the reasons for it are big and growing, and the nation's employers need to learn from them. The unemployment rate has been hovering around 4 percent in recent months. The tight labor market, which has created intense competition for qualified employees at every level, may not be a fluke but a new reality. That is because it stems not just from a growing economy, and an older work force that has been retiring at progressively younger ages, but from a shrinking number of young workers, too. Thanks to lower birth rates, there are simply fewer young people available to fill new jobs. Within four years, for the first time in American history, there will be fewer people aged 20 to 29 in the population than people 55 to 69. The gap will grow. By 2020, the younger group may be 40 percent smaller than the older one.</p>
        <p>By then, about half the boomer generation -- those 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964 -- will have passed the age of 65. They are healthier than their parents. They will live longer, and two surveys in the last two years, by Fortune magazine and AARP, found that 74 to 80 percent of them expect to still be working in retirement. A recent Harris poll estimated that there are four million people over 65 who would like to be working</p>
        <p>In the past, traditional biases against older workers -- that they are slow, less motivated than younger people and technologically inept -- have closed that door. But the changing demographics led William Zinke, head of a private human resources company, to commission a survey by Harris last fall of the human resource directors at almost 800 American companies. Eighty percent of them agreed that there was less turnover among older workers than younger ones, 74 percent said they were more reliable, and 71 percent said they had as much ability to acquire new skills. Sixty-two percent agreed that younger workers were actually less creative and innovative than older workers, and 80 percent said they had more absenteeism.</p>
        <p>It seems a striking vote of confidence by the nation's corporate gatekeepers in the qualities of older workers. But their actions have not been the equal of their words. Those gatekeepers have been doing their best to push older workers out for years, because they are paid more than younger ones. As the boomer generation begins turning 55 next year,  corporate America should be finding ways to retain, retrain or rehire old workers.</p>
