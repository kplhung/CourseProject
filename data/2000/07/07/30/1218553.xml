      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Japanese novelist Shusaku Endo (1923-96) is best known in the West for ''Silence,'' his historical novel of Christian martyrs in 17th-century Japan. A Christian himself, Endo wrote from the straddled vantage of a Japanese man who embraced a Western philosophy; his fiction is at once the work of an insider and an alien. The stories collected in FIVE BY ENDO (New Directions, paper, $7) are among his best, and they are published here in a sleek, inexpensive volume. In ''Unzen,'' a middle-aged man with an unnamed guilt visits the sulfurous valley where Christians were tortured centuries before. Endo's prose is unadorned, yet in his hands sainthood becomes ambiguous: the martyr blazes with glory, but the cowardly apostate ''endures a pain none of you can comprehend.'' Sin, in Endo's view, is sometimes nothing more than the failure to acknowledge common humanity. ''Japanese in Warsaw'' follows a group of touring businessmen as they ''waddled in single file like ducks'' in search of souvenirs and cheap sex, unable to make any connection between the city's tragedies and themselves. Things, as much as people, can be storytellers: in ''The Box,'' old photos unlock the forgotten history of a half-Japanese Christian interrogated by the military police during World War II. Haunted by the relics the woman left, the narrator muses that ''trees and rocks and even postcards saturated with the thoughts of men must all speak to one another in hushed voices.'' In Endo's hands, the past is always vital in the present and how we judge history is in turn a judgment on ourselves.</p>
