        <p>Blameless</p>
        <p>By Lisa Reardon.</p>
        <p>Random House, $24.95.</p>
        <p>Mary Culpepper, the 34-year-old protagonist of Lisa Reardon's second novel, is a tough, independent woman. She drives a school bus in a small Michigan town, plays in a local softball league and can polish off a six-pack in one sitting. But behind this hardy exterior is an angry and anxious loner who's reeling from the effects of her past and the uncertainty of her future. After one of the children from her bus route asks Mary to go into his house to check on his ill sister, she discovers that the girl has died. Mary is then forced to wrestle with the burden of testifying against the mother accused of the murder and trying to outwit a phantom she calls the Night Visitor, who invades her sleep with haunting images of the young victim. Overcome with a sense of dread, Mary broods about her unhappy life, her strained relationships with her family and an unforgivable betrayal by her best friend, and finds solace in a passionate affair she knows can only bring her more grief. Reardon weaves this tale in emotionally resonant prose. But although her writing is strong and spare, she tries to be cute at times, as if she were attempting to sandwich some humor into an otherwise melancholy story line. Similarly awkward is Mary's obsession with her car: this may be a way of illustrating her profound lack of honest, unhurtful human connection, but the 1965 Mercury Monterey, otherwise known as ''the Merc,'' makes an appearance on far too many pages and quickly becomes as irritating as a nervous tic. While the novel poses questions about the cost of obeying moral imperatives, Reardon answers them with an ending that is not so much unrealistic as convenient.</p>
