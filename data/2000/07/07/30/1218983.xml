        <p>New York's race for the United States Senate focused yesterday on the Middle East, with Representative Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton courting the Jewish vote with expressions of support for Israel and sniping at each other over who said what about the relocation of the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Moving the embassy would be a coup for Israel and Jews around the world who have long sought international recognition for Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state. After the Camp David peace talks failed last week, President Clinton said in an Israeli television interview on Friday that he favored moving the embassy and would decide the question by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton went a step further yesterday, calling for moving the embassy before year's end. ''I am pleased that the president has announced he'll review the decision about moving our embassy to Jerusalem,'' she said in an interview on WCBS Radio. ''That's absolutely the right thing to do. But I'd like to see that move be made before the end of the year.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, apparently not to be outdone, called for moving the embassy to Jerusalem immediately, and accused his Democratic rival of flip-flopping on the issue. He said Mrs. Clinton told an Orthodox Jewish group nine months ago that she could not support an immediate move of the embassy.</p>
        <p>''I just don't think her remarks have credibility,'' Mr. Lazio told The Associated Press at an impromptu news conference at a diner on Long Island. ''The real issue here is that she has said in the past that she is not for placing the embassy in Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>That assertion drew a sharp rebuke from Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman. ''Rick Lazio is knowingly misleading New Yorkers about Hillary's record,'' he said. ''At the start of the listening tour last year, Hillary made it very clear that she supported moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>The dispute on the surface seemed stark: did she or did she not support the embassy move? But, as is often the way with campaign talk, the truth seemed to turn on the less evident question of what she said about the timing of such a move.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfson produced a letter, dated July 2, 1999, in which Mrs. Clinton, who was then only considering a Senate race, assured Dr. Mandell I. Ganchrow, president of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, that she advocated ''a strong and secure Israel, able to live in peace with its neighbors, with the United States Embassy located in its capital, Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>The letter added, ''Of course, the timing of such a move must be sensitive to Israel's interest in achieving secure peace with its neighbors.'' That, in the heat of a campaign, might be construed by an opponent as an equivocation by Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Seeking to woo New York's Jewish voters, about 12 percent of the electorate, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio have both taken pro-Israel positions in the Senate campaign, sometimes in remarkably similar words. Mrs. Clinton has declared that Jerusalem should be ''the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel,'' and Mr. Lazio, speaking at a Jewish center in East Hampton, N.Y., yesterday, said he supported ''a united, undivided Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital.''</p>
        <p>Commenting yesterday on the breakdown of peace talks that President Clinton had brokered at Camp David -- talks that stumbled over the status of Jerusalem -- Mrs. Clinton suggested that the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, was largely to blame, and she praised the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, for his efforts to resolve issues that have been outstanding for half a century.</p>
        <p>''It's clear that Prime Minister Barak came committed to reaching a deal that would guarantee peace and security for Israel and the entire region, and I'm sorry that Chairman Arafat didn't show the same commitment,'' Mrs. Clinton told Ben Farnsworth, a CBS Radio anchorman.</p>
        <p>Apparently referring to a meeting set for today on the border of the Gaza Strip among senior Palestinian and Israeli representatives, Mrs. Clinton added: ''I am pleased the talks are going to resume again. But this is a historic moment and it's time that Chairman Arafat step forward and conclusively demonstrate his willingness to forge a real, lasting peace agreement.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also appealed to Mr. Arafat not to carry out his stated intention of unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state by Sept. 13. If Mr. Arafat did so, she said, the United States should cut off Palestinian aid.</p>
        <p>''The Palestinian Authority must abide by its commitment to avoid violence or unilateral action,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio was greeted warmly yesterday at an Orthodox synagogue in Westhampton Beach, N.Y., after he vowed to continue working for a unified Jerusalem. He spoke at the synagogue a week after Mrs. Clinton addressed the congregation.</p>
        <p>''With regard to Jerusalem, my position has been clear and consistent over the past eight years,'' he said, referring to his terms in Congress. ''I have supported a united, undivided Jerusalem,'' he told the crowd of several hundred worshipers, who applauded loudly.</p>
