        <p>Two-thirds of the way through this season, it is obvious that the Orioles will again stay home, where they will languish for the third successive season despite spending more money on their payroll ($229 million) in that period than any team except the Yankees ($246.5 million).

        <p>Before the days of a $100 million payroll, in other words last season, seven of the nine teams with the highest payrolls reached the playoffs. The Baltimore Orioles and the Los Angeles Dodgers stayed home.</p>
        <p>Two-thirds of the way through this season, it is obvious that the Orioles will again stay home, where they will languish for the third successive season despite spending more money on their payroll ($229 million) in that period than any team except the Yankees ($246.5 million). For all of their lavish expenditures, the Orioles have fizzled faster than a July 4 fireworks show in rain.</p>
        <p>The Dodgers, on the other hand, present the appearance of a contender and may finally gain some reward for their payroll proclivities, which have made them No. 3 ($221.4 million) behind the Yankees and the Orioles in this three-year period.</p>
        <p>''We think we're in position to make a good run,'' General Manager Kevin Malone said. ''We control our own destiny. We're right where we need to be.''</p>
        <p>The Dodgers began play yesterday two and a half games games from first place in the National League West and two and a half games from the wild-card lead. Since the end of the interleague portion of the schedule, they had won 10 of 13 games and all 4 series they had played.</p>
        <p>And in the midst of that stretch, they weathered news media reports that if the Dodgers did not get to the playoffs this year they would fire Davey Johnson as manager and try to replace him with the Giants' Dusty Baker, the manager of one of the two teams ahead of them in the division race.</p>
        <p>''You have a big payroll, you need to win,'' Johnson said. ''Anything else doesn't matter. I've dealt with that before.''</p>
        <p>But Johnson recently also had to deal with an incidence of arrhythmia, which put him in the hospital.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to try to make this work,'' he said of the team and its chances of winning. ''I'm going to try not to let it kill me. I don't want to be looking up; I want to be looking down.''</p>
        <p>He referred to his position in life, but he could just as well have meant the Dodgers' position in the standings.</p>
        <p>The Dodgers are not generally viewed as strong a contender as Arizona and San Francisco, but when given a decent team to work with, Johnson has produced impressive results. His first team in Los Angeles did not meet that criterion.</p>
        <p>''Last year's team was basically a right-handed ballclub,'' said Johnson, who was the Orioles' manager in their last two playoff appearances. ''The bench was very weak. The bullpen was very weak. And there was no depth or flexibility in any area. There were a lot of middle infielders on the 40-man roster.''</p>
        <p>Malone made improvements in those areas during the off-season, and some of the moves paid off in helping the Dodgers overcome a raft of injuries.</p>
        <p>''If we had had the kind of injuries last year that we've had this year, I'd hate to think about it.''</p>
        <p>Todd Hundley, the power-hitting catcher, returned last week from his second spell on the disabled list, this one for a fractured thumb. Center fielder Devon White recently came back after missing two and a half months with a partly torn rotator cuff. Third baseman Adrian Beltre missed three weeks earlier in the season with a strained hamstring.</p>
        <p>Kevin Brown, the No. 1 starter, and Jeff Shaw, the closer, headed a long list of pitchers who have served time on the disabled list.</p>
        <p>The team's most important hitters, however, Gary Sheffield, Eric Karros and Shawn Green, have remained healthy. Sheffield's bat, in fact, has been especially healthy. Possibly headed for the best season of his 12-year career, Sheffield went into yesterday's schedule leading the major leagues with 34 home runs and had driven in 87 runs with a .340 batting average.</p>
        <p>''He's comfortable; he's at peace with himself,'' Malone said of the outfielder who has often been an angry player. ''His wife has had a positive impact on him and he's grown spiritually.''</p>
        <p>Malone said he had been impressed with Sheffield's versatility as a hitter. ''He hits home runs, but when he needs a base hit, he gets it,'' the general manager said. ''He can hit the ball the opposite way. For a guy with his power he has tremendous bat control.''</p>
        <p>Sheffield and friends have provided sufficient run production, and the relief corps has given the Dodgers a sterling effort. As with so many contenders, the team's playoff chances will most likely fall on their starting pitchers.</p>
        <p>Brown has performed as a No. 1 starter should, compiling a 10-3 record with a 2.31 earned run average. Chan Ho Park, with an 11-7 record, seems to have straightened himself out after having gone a month (June 18 to July 20) without a victory.</p>
        <p>But the Dodgers need consistently effective work from Darren Dreifort (3-0, 1.29 E.R.A. last three starts) and Carlos Perez, as well as Ismael Valdes, whom they reacquired from the Cubs last week after having traded him to Chicago last winter.</p>
        <p>''Dreifort has been brilliant at times and mediocre or bad at times,'' Johnson said. ''Perez has been O.K., kept us in some ball games. You've got to get three out of five well-pitched games, sometimes four out of five. That's what the good clubs do.''</p>
        <p>The Dodgers have two months to show they belong in that category. The Orioles have already proved they do not.</p>
        <p>Angels' Five-Man Infield</p>
        <p>The box score suggested an image that simply didn't compute: Mo Vaughn playing center field.</p>
        <p>Indeed, next to Vaughn's name in the box of Anaheim's game in Texas last Wednesday night was the position designation ''1b-cf-1b.'' And just two names later, it said ''G. Anderson cf-1b-cf.'' That combination indicated that sometime during the game Vaughn and Anderson switched positions.</p>
        <p>Not quite, as it turned out. Several times this season, Mike Scioscia, the Angels' manager, has brought in an outfielder to serve as a fifth infielder in obvious sacrifice situations. In this instance, Frank Catalanotto lashed a pinch-hit triple with one out in the ninth inning of a 5-5 game. With Luis Alicea the next batter, Scioscia called for his five-man infield.</p>
        <p>Anderson came in from center and went to the first baseman's position. Vaughn moved to his right, stationing himself near where the second baseman usually plays. Adam Kennedy, the second baseman, played up the middle. The shift turned out to be unnecessary; Alicea hit a fly to left. Anderson went back to center, Vaughn to first, but Rusty Greer singled to left, ending the game.</p>
        <p>3 Former Mets in Trades</p>
        <p>They are all gone now, Jason Isringhausen, Bill Pulsipher, Paul Wilson. At one time they were the future nucleus of the Mets' starting pitching rotation. But injuries undermined that plan, leaving the trio as prime examples why some contending teams are not reluctant to trade top prospects for established major league players when they have a chance to get to the playoffs. Prospects don't come with guarantees.</p>
        <p>The Mets sent Isringhausen to Oakland at the trading deadline last year. They traded Pulsipher, for the second time, to Arizona two months ago after having reacquired him from Milwaukee last January. Wilson, who seemingly has been on perpetual injury rehab, was the last to go, leaving the organization Friday in a trade to Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>Making Deals to Contend</p>
        <p>Teams are no longer considered set. They are works in progress, contending teams every bit as much as less talented, less experienced clubs.</p>
        <p>The Cleveland Indians came into this season with a string of five division titles, but stuck 10 1/2 games from No. 6, they reconfigured 20 percent of their roster in a matter of hours Friday. In three trades, they added two starting pitchers (Jason Bere and Steve Woodard), changed their closer (from Steve Karsay to Bob Wickman) and acquired a first baseman (David Segui) and a designated hitter (Wil Cordero).</p>
        <p>In a frenzy of trade activity, the Indians and two other playoff contenders executed six trades involving 25 players Friday, and the deadline for trades without waivers isn't until 4 p.m. tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Six other contenders had previously made moves to bolster their chances. Prime among them were the Yankees, who have not been satisfied to rest on the laurels of their World Series success in recent seasons. Their acquisitions changed 16 percent of their roster.</p>
        <p>The most recent newcomer, Glenallen Hill, won a game for them Friday night with a pinch-hit grand slam. Another of their reinforcements, Denny Neagle, has pitched two victories and would have had three if the bullpen had held his lead Friday. Andy Ashby has pitched three victories for Atlanta. Curt Schilling won his first start for Arizona on Friday night.</p>
        <p>''Arizona, the defending champ, went out and got arguably the best pitcher available,'' Davey Johnson, the Los Angeles manager, said. ''I like Neagle and I like Ashby, but when healthy, Schilling is the pick of the litter.''</p>
        <p>The most untimely trade of those made so far was the one between the Indians and Milwaukee on Friday. In going to Cleveland, Wickman left behind 30,000 posters of himself. They were to be given to fans at the Brewers' game last night.</p>
        <p>''We mentioned it to Dean -- jokingly,'' Jon Greenberg, the team's media relations director, said, referring to General Manager Dean Taylor. ''But naturally baseball takes precedence.''</p>
        <p>Greenberg, however, was undaunted. ''We'll give them away anyway,'' he said. ''He was our All-Star.''</p>
