        <p>''What are you doing here?'' Stephen Webster demanded in gravelly tones as he arrived at the opening party on a recent Tuesday for One Fine Thing, a new boutique in St. John Street, in Clerkenwell. He was greeting an old friend -- not the store owner, but the doorman, Danny Moore, an elderly gent of military bearing, apparently moonlighting from his day job at Goldsmith's Hall, home of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths.</p>
        <p>Mr. Webster is one of London's most innovative jewelers, a favorite of clients like Madonna and Kate Winslet, but as a member of the Goldsmiths, an ancient London guild, he is honored by his more traditional peers. In a city where parking spaces are more valued than any celebrity clientele, Mr. Moore is the man who lets Mr. Webster park his motorbike in one of the Goldsmiths' four coveted parking spaces.</p>

        <p>''What are you doing here?'' Stephen Webster demanded in gravelly tones as he arrived at the opening party on a recent Tuesday for One Fine Thing, a new boutique in St. John Street, in Clerkenwell. He was greeting an old friend -- not the store owner, but the doorman, Danny Moore, an elderly gent of military bearing, apparently moonlighting from his day job at Goldsmith's Hall, home of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths.</p>
        <p>Mr. Webster is one of London's most innovative jewelers, a favorite of clients like Madonna and Kate Winslet, but as a member of the Goldsmiths, an ancient London guild, he is honored by his more traditional peers. In a city where parking spaces are more valued than any celebrity clientele, Mr. Moore is the man who lets Mr. Webster park his motorbike in one of the Goldsmiths' four coveted parking spaces.</p>
        <p>Mr. Webster, 40, goes to openings and parties several nights a week after working long days in his workshop, making bold, big, one-of-a-kind designs that have made him a darling of accessories editors at fashion magazines on both sides of the Atlantic. ''It's part of the job, really,'' he explained of his day-into-evening schedule. ''It's like a game, isn't it?''</p>
        <p>His first port of call had been the opening of a Georgian art show at a gallery in Cork Street, Mayfair. There, he and his Russian-born wife, Anastasia, found themselves greeting one old acquaintance, Count Andrei Tolstoy (an offshoot of the writer's family) and making a new one, Jacob Dzhugashvili, an artist and great-grandson of Joseph Stalin. Nash Tavkhelidze, godson of the former Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, was also on hand -- he's the lead singer of Blast, the first Russian band to be signed to a British label.</p>
        <p>''What a bizarre party,'' Mr. Webster said, laughing, to a friend, Neil Cunningham, a couturier. In the sultry weather, the party had moved onto the sidewalk, where the Websters mingled with scions of White and Red Russia, Georgia and the fashionable London art crowd.</p>
        <p>''Count Tolstoy's a wonderful guy,'' Mr. Webster said, as Ms. Webster fluttered from guest to guest in a feather-fringed dress like some exotic, especially sociable little bird, one moment speaking Russian, the next Italian or English. The count organizes London's War and Peace Ball (''I'd go, only they do all that old-school dancing and you've got to have lessons,'' Mr. Webster said), which helped finance the building of the rather grand Russian Orthodox church, blue onion domes and all, that is currently astounding visitors  on the road from Heathrow. ''He got hold of two kilos of caviar -- at an amazingly good price -- for our wedding, and a band of balalaika players,'' Mr. Webster said.</p>
        <p>After a flurry of good-bye kisses, the Websters and Mr. Cunningham squeezed into a car to head across town to the boutique. Soon it was time to head farther east to a cousin's party in a loft apartment in newly fashionable Shoreditch.</p>
        <p>Along the way, Mr. Webster explained something of his life story: apprenticeship in London, long stays in Canada and Santa Barbara, Calif., before returning to London, and opening his store in Duke Street in 1996. His reputation is spreading well beyond this prestigious Mayfair address; Mr. Webster's workshop is working flat out to fill orders from Bergdorf Goodman in New York.</p>
        <p>At the party, after a quick climb to the roof to survey this lively corner of the old East End, Mr. Webster suggested they go dancing. Ms. Webster's answer was a gentle but convincing no. It was getting late, and there was work to do in the morning.</p>
