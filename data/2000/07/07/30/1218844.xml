        <p>Philadelphia cheered in 1998 when Edward Rendell, then the city's mayor, announced he had landed the Republican National Convention. Then everyone asked, ''What is a Republican?'' After all, in a town where voter registration is almost 4-to-1 Democratic, you can live a full and happy life without ever knowing a Republican.</p>
        <p>But the party chose the right city. Republicans will be doing Philadelphians the favor of introducing us to a completely alien concept: two-party democracy. And they will do it by going directly to the citizenry.</p>
        <p>The city's organizing committee for the convention has rounded up about 15,000 local volunteers to guide the Republicans during their stay -- greeting delegates at the airport and helping to ease their visit in the city. Undoubtedly, some volunteers are simply hoping for the chance to get close to a bigwig like Peter Jennings, but as the guides shepherd the visitors through the intricacies of life in our city, Philadelphians and Republicans can get to know each other.</p>
        <p>After establishing that we are all members of the same general species, the Republicans should get right to work and cheerfully ask their guides how it is that a city controlled by compassionate Democrats for almost as long as Mexico was controlled by the P.R.I. runs a school system in which only about 55 percent of the high school students graduate on time.</p>
        <p>They could also innocently ask why, if Philadelphians are so satisfied with the current regime, 160,000 of them moved out of the city in the past decade. Or they might inquire how the city has managed to spend more than $600,000 to rebuild, but not quite finish rebuilding, the 61 houses burned down in 1985 in an attack on political extremists by an earlier Democratic mayor, W. Wilson Goode.</p>
        <p>When they finish quizzing their Democratic guides, the G.O.P. delegates should start on the local Republicans they meet, and begin by asking them why Philadelphia hasn't had a Republican mayor since 1952, and why Philadelphians have shown less clamor for change than the citizens of Mexico. (While it is true that last year's Republican candidate for mayor, Sam Katz, came darned close to winning, he was a converted Democrat whose presence this week will mostly be felt at convention-related parties.) But perhaps Republicans can learn more by just letting the town speak for itself.</p>
        <p>What they will see is that the people of all colors walk or take public transportation in a city where the beautiful buildings are so old that some date back before the Reagan administration. And perhaps they will realize that without some government support, the museums in which some of the G.O.P. events will be held wouldn't be available for lavish parties thrown by corporations lobbying for their own government support.</p>
        <p>And, venturing into the surrounding swaths of urban decay, perhaps the Republicans will notice that the residents spend almost no time clamoring for lower estate taxes or worrying about the imminent threat from North Korea. Their worries about the imminent threat of local drug dealers are quite real, but are likely to get more thoughtful attention at Arianna Huffington's shadow convention than inside the halls of the real convention.</p>
        <p>While we Philadelphians tolerate a lot, this will be our first effort at tolerating large numbers of Republicans. And while the Republicans may not be known for tolerance, they may find us a welcome relief from their convention, whose theme could be summed up as ''The Purpose of our Purpose is Purposefulness.'' But it remains to be seen if they make a lasting impression on us -- or we on them.</p>
