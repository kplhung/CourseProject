        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In your article on the Jersey City Light Rail (''They Think It Can,'' July 16), Gary Brosch, editor of The Journal of Public Transportation, was quoted as saying that buses are ''cheaper and more flexible than fixed rail lines.''</p>
        <p>Buses are cheaper only if the cost of roadways and public traffic support functions are not considered.  The incremental costs of bus service are much greater when more lanes or even new roadways become necessary. Operating costs of buses are much greater; a bus can carry only 60 riders while a light rail train, also operated by one person, holds upward of 300 passengers. Light rail vehicles last far longer. The trolley cars that run quite dependably on the Newark subway are 50 years old, having run more than four times the expected life of a bus. Finally the costs resulting from polluting diesel engines, which fall on the general public, are eliminated with light rail.</p>
        <p>Is light rail a panacea for all transit problems? Certainly not. Successful light rail needs a population density able to support a daily ridership of at least 10,000 commuters. When promoting development, instead of moving people, is made a primary consideration, new rail services often fail to reach predicted ridership. Low ridership on the first segment of the Jersey City Light Rail was predictable. It runs through miles of almost deserted Hudson County brownfields, where few stops have people living within walking distance of the line. In a few years, when developers fill these open spaces with condos and office buildings, there will be plenty of riders using the current segment.</p>
        <p>The reason for low ridership numbers is that the initial planners chose  the wrong first segment for the line.  They ignored the recommendation of the Transit Committee of Bergen County, which was urging New Jersey Transit to begin building the first leg south from Bergen County where the roads are too congested to accommodate many more buses.</p>
