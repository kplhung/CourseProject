        <p>''How Companies Stall Generics and Keep Themselves Healthy'' (front page, July 23) exposed a shameful conspiracy to prop up drug prices. If only the drug companies were directed to conspire for the public good.</p>
        <p>Beyond AIDS, more than 300 million people suffer from malaria each year, and a million die; eight million people suffer from tuberculosis. But since these people live mostly in developing countries, they don't represent sufficient markets for companies to recover drug research investments.</p>
        <p>Industry lawyers could make a compelling case for antitrust waivers for collaboration on drugs and vaccines for devastating diseases. As a precedent, in World War II companies were permitted to collaborate, dramatically accelerating production of penicillin.</p>
        <p>BARRY R. BLOOM  Boston, July 25, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is dean of the Harvard School of Public Health.</p>
