        <p>THE three-bedroom town house that Edith and David Dougherty bought in Baiting Hollow last November overlooks a sea of wildflowers and beyond that, the seventh green of the Fox Hill Golf and Country Club.</p>
        <p>Every good beach day, the Doughertys, who also own a home in Naples, Fla., leave their town house, one of 144 condominiums at the Knolls of Fox Hill, and head for the Swordfish Club in Westhampton Beach, where they own a cabana. Mr. Dougherty, now retired, and his brother, John, owned a beer and soft-drink distributorship in Rocky Point.</p>
        <p>''We love the ocean,'' Mrs. Dougherty said. ''But we like to come home to the North Fork because it is so quiet and pristine,'' she added, gesturing toward the peaceful vista outside her living-room window.</p>
        <p>Turn north instead of south at Exit 71 of  the Long Island Expressway, and the road takes you to a still-rural section of Long Island where home buyers can find a pace that is less frenetic than that on the South Fork, in the Hamptons.</p>
        <p>House prices, though substantially higher than they were three years ago, are still comparatively lower on the North Fork, the  peninsula that stretches northeastward from Calverton and Riverhead. The Knolls of Fox Hill is one of three North Fork developments with frontage on Long Island Sound, and at two of them, homes overlooking the water are coming to market at prices ranging from $239,900 to $600,000.</p>
        <p>''You can't get water views on the South Fork unless you have a million dollars to spend,'' said Denise Doucette, a buyer at another of the three, an 82-unit condominium in Northville called Maidstone Landing.  Her $345,000 house will have views of both the sound and a pond.</p>
        <p>Farmland preservation programs sponsored by Suffolk County and by the Towns of Riverhead and Southold and land acquisition by private nonprofit groups like the Peconic Land Trust and the Nature Conservancy have managed to preserve over 5,000 acres in the two towns that make up the North Fork. In Southold about 2,500 acres of farmland out of a total of 10,000 acres have been permanently protected, largely through the purchase of development rights. In Riverhead, 2,750 acres have been preserved out of a total of 18,000.</p>
        <p>The North Fork's 20 wineries are also helping to preserve its rural quality. At the Macari Vineyards in Mattituck, for example, the Macari family owns 360 acres, of which 170 are currently under cultivation.</p>
        <p>''If I subdivided the land, no one in my family would have to work anymore,'' said Joseph T. Macari as he sat on the deck of his winery, which overlooks fields of ripening grapes.</p>
        <p>He owns a real estate management company in Jackson Heights, Queens, but planting instead of subdividing his Southold property, most of which he bought 40 years ago, ''gives me a lot of satisfaction,'' he said, adding, ''I come out here on weekends, and it just gives me a good feeling.''</p>
        <p>THE average price of houses in the Town of Southold is now $291,000, compared with $178,000 three years ago,  said Robert J. Scalia, the owner of Century 21 Albertson Realty, which has offices in Greenport, Southold and Jamesport. Waterfront houses account for the biggest portion of that increase, Mr. Scalia said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scalia said that buyers could still find a substantial year-round house for under $300,000 on the North Fork. As an example, he cited a 12-year-old four-bedroom colonial in Aquebogue on the market at $260,000.</p>
        <p>Valerie Goode, the owner of Colony Realty in Jamesport, said she has older houses near the water starting at about $140,000. A Jamesport listing, for example, that recently went into contract was a 30-year-old ranch with two bedrooms and a basement within walking distance of Great Peconic Bay. It had been listed at $139,000. A new three-bedroom ranch with rights to a boat slip is on the market for $239,000, she said.</p>
        <p>For waterfront properties on Long Island Sound ''$450,000 to $600,000 buys you something lovely, and $800,000 gets you something really lovely,'' Ms. Goode said.</p>
        <p>At the Knolls of Fox Hills, where the Doughertys bought their town house, construction will start this fall on 18 town houses with a view of the sound.</p>
        <p>Sales at the 34-acre Knolls development began in 1994, but 44 of the units have yet to come to market. The project is being built in five phases by the Benjamin Organization of Garden City, which acquired the property  from a failed bank.</p>
        <p>The first three phases with a total of 84 town houses and flats in two-story buildings on bluffs overlooking the sound are all sold. Only three of the 16 two- to three-bedroom town houses in the section where the Doughertys live are still available. Sales there began last fall at prices ranging from $219,000 to $249,000. The remaining units are each priced at $249,000; Donald Denis of Aquebogue was the architect.</p>
        <p>Construction is scheduled to start in the fall on another 20 houses fronting on the golf course. Benjamin is also converting a six-unit rental apartment building on the golf course into condominiums.</p>
        <p>Prices of the 44 units still coming on the market have not yet been established, said Russell A. Mohr, Benjamin's marketing director.</p>
        <p>Owners at the Knolls share a pool and four tennis courts with an adjoining 126-unit development called the Bluffs at Baiting Hollow, which was completed in 1986 by another developer. They also share a private beach, which is reached by wooden stairs leading down from the bluffs. But the 18-hole Fox Hollow golf course is open only to members and is not part of the development.</p>
        <p>Under construction nearby in Centerville is Willow Ponds, where 222 condominiums, designed by James McDonough of Smithtown, will occupy 111 acres on Long Island Sound. This project, also a onetime foreclosure, was revived two years ago by a Smithtown partnership called Sound Housing.  Since sales resumed in July 1998, 122 flats and town houses have been sold.</p>
        <p>PRICES for units that do not have views of the sound start at $129,000 for a single-level 1,000-square-foot apartment with two bedrooms and two bathrooms.</p>
        <p>The most expensive unit in this group is a 1,500-square-foot two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath town house priced at $159,000. Prices are somewhat higher for town houses with views of Long Island Sound:  two-bedrooms ranging from 1,500 to 1,800 square feet sell for $239,900, to $299,900.</p>
        <p>Homeowners share two tennis courts and 1,000 feet of beachfront. A clubhouse and a pool are under construction.</p>
        <p>Buyers at Willow Ponds are retirees and young professionals, mostly without children because of the compact size of the units, said Dennis Esposito, the owner of  Realty Group Marketing in Smithtown, which is in charge of sales at Willow Ponds.</p>
        <p>''You have a lot of people discovering the North Fork, but I don't see the celebrity clientele coming here, so it's still very quiet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At Maidstone Landing, a condominium development of semiattached town houses  being built in Northville by the Exeter Building Corporation of Manhattan, Ms. Doucette, who now lives in Floral Park, Queens, is buying a two-bedroom house with a finished basement, an extra, for herself and her mother, Lillian. She said that the peacefulness of the North Fork was one of the reasons she decided to buy there, after looking on the South Fork. ''It's too hectic there,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Sales at the 46-acre Maidstone Landing  started two months ago, and 20 of the houses are already under contract, said Bill Fried, the president of Exeter. Prices start at $345,000 for a 1,600-square-foot unit with two bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms and a two-car garage. The most expensive is  $600,000 for a 1,900-square-foot unit overlooking Long Island Sound with a master bedroom on the first floor and a second  bedroom and a loft area upstairs.</p>
        <p>About half the houses will occupy a series of terraced plateaus leading down to the water. Others will overlook a 25-acre pond on which the development has 2,200 feet of frontage. Homeowners will have use of a 1,800-foot-long private beach on the sound where a 2,500-square-foot beachfront clubhouse is currently under construction.</p>
        <p>The traditional-style units, designed by Bloodgood Sharp Buster Architects of Des Moines, take advantage of the sloping terrain, with decks and walkout basements that can be finished as family rooms and dens for an additional $33,000.</p>
        <p>''I designed this project to appeal 60 percent to people whose kids have grown and who are still working,'' Mr. Fried said. ''I anticipated another 30 percent would be retired people, and about 10 percent young professionals without children, and so far that mix has been pretty close.''</p>
        <p>Brokers say that although retirees and people who still work are the primary buyers on the North Fork, the number of second-home buyers is also swelling. ''We are getting people from the South Fork who come here because it reminds them of what the South Fork was like 20 years ago,'' said Suzanne Hahn, the owner of Hahn Realty, which has offices in Greenport and Cutchogue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scalia of Century 21 Albertson Realty said: ''We don't have an ocean, we don't have fancy restaurants, and we don't have many celebrities here. We also don't have the traffic congestion, and we don't have to wait 20 minutes to make a left turn. We are not looking to be New York City with trees and grass.''</p>
