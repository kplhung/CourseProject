        <p>NOT since Anita Bryant has a morality-minded woman been the target of as much vitriol as Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the conservative radio talk-show therapist.</p>

        <p>NOT since Anita Bryant has a morality-minded woman been the target of as much vitriol as Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the conservative radio talk-show therapist.</p>
        <p>''Dr. Laura,'' whose audience is estimated at 18 million, is best known just now for having stated her belief that homosexuality is wrong, to which gay rights groups have responded by lobbying corporations to pull their advertisements from her radio show and upcoming television series.</p>
        <p>She is a woman of many opinions, however, and has managed to offend everybody from librarians and psychologists to witches and vegetarians. In the process, she has spawned a virtual industry of Web sites devoted to mocking, reviling or simply haranguing her -- often with the same blunt mean-spiritedness they complain of regarding the good doctor.</p>
        <p>Herewith a sampling of online commentary.</p>
        <p>THOMAS VINCIGUERRA</p>
        <p>Recently, after nude photos of Dr. Laura circulated on the Internet, one  viewer wrote:</p>
        <p>''I'm not so much interested in what she looks like. I just want to see that she just might be a human being after all.''</p>
        <p>In ''How Could You Do That?! The Abdication of Character, Courage, and Conscience'' (HarperCollins, 1996), Dr. Laura writes: ''Acknowledging that you are basically the perpetrator of your mess of a life is admittedly very upsetting.''</p>
        <p>Her therapeutic method, however, consists largely of browbeating hapless callers into making that admission, or listening to Dr. Laura make it for them, a phenomenon that seems to hold some fascination for many Laura haters, or at least those who correspond with Dr. Laura Watch  (either.or.com/chansen/least-fav/dr-laura -watch.html).</p>
        <p>The most amazing thing about this woman is how I find myself masochistically tuning her in sometimes, wanting to be enraged by her. Perhaps this is some MORAL FLAW in my liberal personality?</p>
        <p>Driving home this afternoon, I heard our local Laura affiliate (760 AM KFMB) run a promo spot for the Doc's show. It was one of those spots that takes a small sound bite from the program. Went something like this:</p>
        <p>Dr. Laura: . . . and you actually let him do that?!?!</p>
        <p>Male Caller: Well, we try to encourage him . . .</p>
        <p>Dr. Laura: (Abruptly cutting him off in her inimitable style) ENCOURAGE HIM?!?!? What do you mean encourage him?! There's NO ENCOURAGEMENT at my house!  There are only rules!!</p>
        <p>...This woman is a maniac.</p>
        <p>In the September 1997 issue of Current Biography, Dr. Laura says: ''I do not see it as my mission to make anybody feel better, I want them to get better.'' Janice Leber, the creator of a Web site called The Moral  Irresponsibility of ''Dr.'' Laura (www  .sonomacountyfreepress.org/liver/dr-laura .html), describes Dr. Laura's preferred treatment:</p>
        <p>1. What is your moral dilemma? (Your answer is unimportant.)</p>
        <p>2. Why are you so stupid as to have created this problem? (Your response will be disjointed.)</p>
        <p>3. Yes, you DID create this problem. Examine your behavior to this point. (Any sound you utter will be mocked. You will fall silent.)</p>
        <p>4. This behavior marks you as an irresponsible, immoral jerk. (You will object.)</p>
        <p>5. I can't take your whining any more. Next call. (You will be cut off.)</p>
        <p>''Killjoy,'' who wrote this spoof which can be found on the Dr. Laura Parody Pages (www.geocities.com/SoHo/Studios/7141/ laura.htm), took a similar tack:</p>
        <p>Caller: Uh, O.K. . . . Well, my wife and I have been married for fourtee--</p>
        <p>Dr. Laura: You're having marital problems, aren't you, Phil? You and your wife have been together quite some time, and you're having problems, aren't you? This is not a healthy relationship right now. You can't go on like this with your wife.</p>
        <p>Caller: Um, yeah. You see, we've been having trouble communicating. When I go to tell her how --</p>
        <p>Dr. Laura: Phil, what we don't need is a whole bunch of examples of your problems.  What all this boils down to is that you're having trouble communicating with your wife, aren't you? You want to find a solution to this, but you don't know how, do you?  You're feeling guilty about talking to other women, and you're afraid that she thinks that you're coming on to them. You can't let her go on feeling this way, Phil.</p>
        <p>In ''How Could You Do That?'' Dr. Laura criticizes ''advocates for each societal subgroup'' who depict themselves and their groups as victims. The endlessly expanding roster of such groups insulted by the doctor was put to good use by one on-line contributor, who devised the Dr. Laura Drinking Game  (extra.newsguy.com/satire/maddi.htm), a small portion of which is excerpted here:</p>
        <p>If Dr. Laura makes a general insult toward a group, take a drink and then do appropriate action for each group:</p>
        <p>Feminists: Shout ''Equality never, baby!'' and mime lifting your skirt.</p>
        <p>Atheists: Shout ''I believe, baby!'' and genuflect.</p>
        <p>Educators: Shout ''A-B-C-D-E-F-G, Hooked on Phonics is all I need!'' and pretend to write on a blackboard.</p>
        <p>Gays: Shout ''We're here, we're queer, I wish you'd go away!'' and make triangle with hands.</p>
        <p>Journalists: Shout ''First Amendment, First Schmamendment!'' and pretend to throw a newspaper.</p>
        <p>Talk show hosts: Shout ''But you are one, baby!'' and spin finger in a circle near your head.</p>
        <p>Dr. Laura says hers is ''a morality show,'' and she claims the highest authority for her views. ''My morality is based on the Old Testament and the Talmud,'' she says. '' Whenever I can, I try and push people toward religion.''</p>
        <p>The site And God Created Laura (www.hcco.org/archive/articles/ andgod.htm) imagines all that pushiness directed toward an unlikely subject:</p>
        <p>Dr. Laura: I see. So, God, tell me how you became a parent.</p>
        <p>God: Well, it was a long time ago. In six days, I created heaven, earth, plant and animal life along with the first man, Adam, and the first woman, Eve. I placed them in the Garden of Eden, told them to be fruitful and multiply and never eat from the tree of knowledge. Then on the seventh day, I rested.  But while I was gone, a snake convinced them to eat the forbidden fruit and when they did, they saw they were naked. When I next saw them, they were clothed in fig leaves and I was very angry.</p>
        <p>Dr. Laura: So let me see if I've got this straight. You've got kids that are only a few days old and you decide you just want to sleep all day so you drop them off unsupervised in a garden full of snakes and dangerous fruit with no clothes on and tell them to engage in incestuous free love and get pregnant! What kind of a parent are you?</p>
