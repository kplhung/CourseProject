        <p>IT happened on a Friday night in Madison Square Garden, a scene so intense that it burns in the memory 32 years later. To the audience, wild in its effusions, it was clear that the show was over. But nobody wanted to hear that.</p>
        <p>The object of their adulation was Janis Joplin and she was unafraid of wildness. Her style, in life and in art, was an invitation to danger. If only ''Love, Janis,'' a skewed imitation of a biographical musical at the Bay Street Theater here, transmitted the sense of danger, the visceral sensation that defined the star who, even in the golden age of rock 'n' roll, was called the most exciting performer of her generation.</p>
        <p>As the cheering section moved closer to the security guards positioned at the barricades, Joplin demanded that her protectors let the fans onto the stage. ''C'mon! C'mon!'' she roared, as if she were making good on her signature lyric, ''Take a piece of my heart.''</p>
        <p>Her arms were outstretched to embrace what looked like a mob that could have mauled her. Onto the stage they came, some bearing flowers. For one truly shining moment, they were all flower children.</p>
        <p>Clearly the love Janis Joplin received was not enough to sustain her life, which she ended, alone in a Hollywood motel, at 27, two years after that Manhattan love-in. Cause of death, according to the coroner's report: ''Acute heroin and morphine intoxication due to injection of overdose.'' For all her publicized sexual escapades, she once wrote to her mother, ''The only thing I have is with the audience.''</p>
        <p>In ''Love, Janis,'' excerpts from ''Dear Mother'' letters are interspersed with 19 musical numbers from the fabled Joplin repertory. Add an invisible interviewer trying vainly to get a grip on the Joplin mystique and the demons that haunted her. It's not that Joplin was not a forthcoming interview subject. It's that the art of the interview eludes the voice one hears asking questions like ''What do you think young people are looking for today?'' (Her answer: ''Sincerity and a good time'') and ''What are your thoughts?'' (''I'm a survivor,'' she said after Jimi Hendrix's death, less than three weeks before her own.)</p>
        <p>Whatever dramatic irony one derives from ''Love, Janis'' could just as easily come from looking it up. Call the show an epistolary concert with a dash of Q and A on the side, a denouement that comes from Journalism 101 and a couple of post-mortem numbers that might make a statement about a legend living on, but do not, emerging instead as incoherent afterthoughts. This disordered hybrid is an odd midseason substitution for ''Two Lives,'' a play by Arthur Laurents that Bay Street management says is ''in pre-production,'' whatever that means, for New York, but is not to be found on the schedules of variously mentioned theaters.</p>
        <p>It would be hard to otherwise imagine a show of such manipulativeness and disarray in the repertory of a serious-minded theater. One learns about her dogs, a cat and various one-night stands (not on stage) and that Southern Comfort was her ''voice preserver,'' but the essence of a life of noisy desperation is not to be found in the words Randal Myler culled from letters included in a book by Laura Joplin, younger sister to Janis.</p>
        <p>Even though details are more informational than insightful, telling ones are bypassed. The mother to whom Janis is reciting her letters interminably was an offbeat character in her own right, an obviously essential link to her daughtrer's outrage and outrageousness. A bizarre high school reunion in Port Arthur, Tex., is a contrived allusion, when it could be theatrically potent, for by then Janis, who thought of herself as middle-aged when she was 26 -- and really old -- was described as looking ''like 10 miles of bad road.'' But not in the text here.</p>
        <p>It is not necessary to emphasize the lurid aspects of a genuine original who wasn't ''at all sold on becoming a poor man's Cher,'' but it is just as exploitative to sanitize a troubled life by giving lip service to the fears in and the frankness of her own words. Joplin remains an indelible symbol of an amazing decade, embodying excess and an agonized coexistence, between peace and self destruction, harmony and turmoil.</p>
        <p>The obsessive joy of performing that defined Joplin, live onstage, cannot be extracted from the abridged letters and interviews, or from the fiercely animated and strenuous singing of Cathy Richardson, Bay Street's opening night Janis Joplin, who alternates with Andra C. Mitrovich, so strenuous indeed are the requirements for a vocal attack that hurled out notes, wails and raspy  moans rooted in a fusion of rock, soul and everything that is the blues.</p>
        <p>Other productions -- in Cleveland, Chicago, Denver (where the show began in 1994) and Austin, Tex. -- have had various Janis Joplin sound alikes, including Ms. Richardson and Ms. Mitrovich, with Catherine Curtin playing Janis, for the fourth time at Bay Street.</p>
        <p>What? Janis Joplin and Janis? Yup. Plainly speaking, one sings, the other reads, and bothering to explain would not be in the best interests of a ghoulish show that brings in the noise but leaves out the soul.</p>
