        <p>BOOKS about the city's police department are a hardy perennial in New York bookstores. Here are excerpts from two recent arrivals:</p>
        <p>NYPD: A City and Its Police  By James Lardner and Thomas Reppetto  Henry Holt &amp; Company  (Hardcover, $27.50)</p>
        <p>The dedication of some cops was amazing. The NYPD's citywide Anticrime Unit was one of the most dangerous assignments on the force. Its officers in plainclothes and unmarked cars, patrolled high-crime areas looking for gun toters and stickup men. Bobby Gallagher had a knack for telling by the way somebody walked whether he was armed. Many a street criminal with a gun in his belt would make a constant subconscious effort to keep it from falling out.</p>

        <p>BOOKS about the city's police department are a hardy perennial in New York bookstores. Here are excerpts from two recent arrivals:</p>
        <p>NYPD: A City and Its Police  By James Lardner and Thomas Reppetto  Henry Holt &amp; Company  (Hardcover, $27.50)</p>
        <p>The dedication of some cops was amazing. The NYPD's citywide Anticrime Unit was one of the most dangerous assignments on the force. Its officers in plainclothes and unmarked cars, patrolled high-crime areas looking for gun toters and stickup men. Bobby Gallagher had a knack for telling by the way somebody walked whether he was armed. Many a street criminal with a gun in his belt would make a constant subconscious effort to keep it from falling out.</p>
        <p>Spotting a likely suspect, Gallagher and his partner did not leap out of their car with their own weapons in hand; that could have led them into shooting an innocent person or fighting a gun battle in which their slow-firing .38 caliber-caliber revolvers would be matched against nine-millimeter semiautomatics. Instead, they would unobtrusively move in until Gallagher was close enough to place his hand over the suspect's weapon, making it impossible for him to draw it.</p>
        <p>During his seventeen years of service, Gallagher made 1,200 loaded-gun arrests and received 210 citations. In 1984 Governor Mario Cuomo named him New York State police officer of the year. But he ended up in a homicide unit where he was mostly expected to write reports. Like a number of other conspicuously active cops in the seventies and eighties, Gallagher bailed out of the department early, starting a private security firm in 1986.</p>
        <p>After his promotion to detective in 1980, Jack Maple decided on a change of lifestyle. Five feet, seven inches tall and stocky, he bore the nickname, at the time, of ''Fatso.'' Now he went on a diet, cutting ten inches from his waistline, and bought three designer suits.</p>
        <p>In place of Fatso there appeared a Damon Runyon character with derby hat, bow tie, and white shoes. He began hanging out at the plush Waldorf and Plaza Hotel bars. Before his sojourn was over, he had mortgaged his home to borrow $28,000, which, by his own account, he ''quickly converted into bottles of Dom Perignon and Broadway shows.'' A youthful marriage had also ended, and the new Maple squired many a glamorous woman before his money ran out and they did, as well. A profile in New York magazine described Maple as ''the cop who loved the Oak Bar,'' referring to a fashionable watering hole at the Plaza.</p>
        <p>Maple's assigned area, the Times Square subway complex, resembled a Casbah. Hordes of prostitutes and three-card-monte men waited to fleece tourists and the bridge-and-tunnel crowd from New Jersey. Muggers were attracted to Forty-second Street, or, as they call it, the ''Deuce.'' Maple continued his practice of following the bad guys out of the subway.</p>
        <p>Sometimes he would mount a stakeout near a store that sold holsters and gun paraphernalia; somebody who patronized such a place, Maple reasoned, was more likely than the average Joe to be carrying a gun. On occasion, his instincts were validated by an arrest. In 1985, Maple made sergeant and was put in charge of a decoy squad. The unit was composed of cops made up to look like stiffs -- bait for muggers -- and backup cops who sought to blend in with the street population.</p>
        <p>On New Year's Eve, when the ball dropped in Times Square, Maple and his crew would mingle in the dense crowds until they spotted a ''wolfpack,'' a team of robbers preparing to move in on a victim. Just as they were about to strike, the cops would jump them, and there would be a wild melee, sometimes requiring a cavalry charge by the mounted police to help make the arrests. Maple became the subject of another New York magazine story, this one entitled ''Hunting the Wolfpacks.'' More than once, suspected muggers would be found carrying a picture of Maple and his crew, cut out of the article.</p>
        <p>ROOKIE COP: Deep Undercover in the Jewish Defense League  By Richard Rosenthal  Leapfrog Press  (Paperback, $14.95)</p>
        <p>During one of my initial visits to the BOSSI office, I recall a conversation I had with Lou (Barnie Mulligan). It was when he first discussed my task of infiltrating the Jewish Defense League. His words to me were, ''They're like a black cloud on the horizon.'' I believe that at that time, the department had no real idea as to what level of threat to public safety Rabbi Meir Kahane and his group posed. Up to then, the JDL and its small band had generated a good deal of publicity by staging some annoying demonstrations, causing disruptions of public hearing on school issues and committing a few assaults on members of other extremist groups.</p>
        <p>One morning soon after, it was Teddy who called. He instructed me to walk past the Ocean Parkway Jewish Center that evening. A JDL demonstration was to take place there and the detective told me to pick up some JDL leaflets. I was to do nothing more, Teddy was very specific about that. Just walk by, accept a couple of handbills and be on my way. Teddy then said we would meet a day or so later when he'd show me what to do with the literature I picked up as well as how to write the report required of me regarding the contact.</p>
        <p>Finally, a mission! A quest! That day seemed to drag on forever until, shortly before 6:30 P.M., I set out for the nearby train station. Although I owned a little VW bug, the directions from Teddy had been clear, ''Take public transportation. We'll reimburse you.''</p>
        <p>Like the good little soldier I was, I took the nearby D train, thereby taking nearly an hour (most of that time spent waiting for the train and walking to Ocean Parkway from the McDonald Avenue train stop) to travel what would have been less than a twenty minute car ride.</p>
        <p>During the trip I remember feeling as if I possessed some secret. I wasn't just some guy among the other guys sitting on the subway train, I was an undercover police officer on an assignment.</p>
        <p>Some assignment.</p>
