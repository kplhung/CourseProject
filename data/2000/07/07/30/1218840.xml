        <p>IT cannot be easy for the Dorrance family to read the newspapers these days. In headline after headline, one food company after another has committed to a sale or a merger, leaving the descendants of John T. Dorrance, the chemist who invented condensed soup more than a century ago, with an agonizing decision: Should they sell the Campbell Soup Company, which has been in the family's hands for three generations but is now struggling? Or should they hire new management to revive flagging sales of its chicken noodle and tomato soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies and perhaps become an acquirer itself?</p>
        <p>Despite its status as family-controlled company, Campbell has been managed over the last decade to emphasize the quarterly results favored by Wall Street analysts and large outside investors. Under its energetic chief executive, David W. Johnson, Campbell boasted ever-fatter profit margins and a stock price that climbed nearly sixfold in roughly eight years, to more than $60 a share in 1998, just after he left.</p>
        <p>But those gains did not last long after Mr. Johnson handed over management of the company to Dale F. Morrison in 1997. In recent years, consumers have increasingly turned away from Campbell's familiar red-and-white cans to soups that seem fresher and easier to open and prepare. As overall sales of canned soup have flattened, Campbell has lost business to cheaper private-label brands and, more recently, its nemesis, Progresso. And competitors like Nabisco have nibbled away at its Pepperidge Farm cookie and cracker business.</p>
        <p>Lately, with many rivals joining forces and gaining clout with supermarket chains, the threat to Campbell has grown. ''The fundamentals of the business seem to be putrid,'' said Art Cecil, an analyst for T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund company, which owns shares in Campbell.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cecil is not alone. Campbell's stock now trades at  $26.4375, down 56 percent from that 1998 peak. For the fiscal year ended last August, the company earned $724 million on sales of $6.4 billion, but more recently, the results have deteriorated. Earnings fell 14 percent in the quarter ended in April, compared with the period a year earlier. Despite all the merger talk, only one Wall Street analyst is now recommending the stock.</p>
        <p>The value of the Dorrance family's own holdings has dropped by more than $7 billion, to $6 billion. And when Mr. Morrison resigned in March, the Dorrances turned again to Mr. Johnson, 67, who had retired as chairman the previous July and had spent his new-found leisure time climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and traveling to the North Pole.</p>
        <p>The combination of the dismal stock performance and the frenzy of industry consolidation appears to be forcing the family, which owns just over half the company's stock, to reconsider Campbell's independence. No question, a turnaround would be lengthy -- and costly. Perhaps giving a clue to the future, the Dorrances surprised Wall Street last month, when they appeared willing to sell Campbell for about $35 a share to Bestfoods, which was fending off the overtures of Unilever. It was only after Unilever prevailed that Bestfoods' plans to buy Campbell were dropped.</p>
        <p>''When have the Dorrances had enough?'' asked Ken Harris of Cannondale Associates, a consulting firm, who said he believes the company must find a partner. ''The clock is definitely ticking.''</p>
        <p>The family -- Dr. Dorrance's nine grandchildren -- is hardly an activist group. The last Dorrance to run the company was Dr. Dorrance's son, John T. Jr., who was chairman for more than two decades until 1984. In part, the company has been a victim of changing tastes, but critics say that Campbell -- as the Dorrances watched -- benefited from years in which the company improved its earnings by cutting costs and stinting on development and marketing.</p>
        <p>''None of the cylinders is working right now,'' said David Kolpak, an analyst with Key Asset Management, who faults Campbell and Mr. Johnson in particular, contending that they raised prices too aggressively and failed to invest wisely in brands. ''A lot of that they have themselves to blame.''</p>
        <p>NONE of the family members returned phone calls seeking comment. But former executives and others who know the family said they had persuaded Mr. Johnson to return as chief executive to help them decide what to do.</p>
        <p>The company has also hired an executive search firm, SpencerStuart, to find a permanent replacement for Mr. Morrison. (Nabisco's chief executive, James Kilts, is one name favored by analysts.) A choice is likely to be made by year-end -- unless Campbell is sold.</p>
        <p>Scattered across the country, the grandchildren appear to prefer pastimes like riding horses to managing the family business. As they have gone separate ways, they have not remained particularly close and do not necessarily have the same opinions. The Dorrances ''are very much going to look to David to try to get out of this,'' said Terry Bivens, an analyst with Bear Stearns.</p>
        <p>As one former Campbell executive put it, ''David is like a honorary family member.''</p>
        <p>Widely heralded as one of the industry's best managers, Mr. Johnson may find that his own reputation is also very much at stake. In a recent interview at Campbell's headquarters here -- a building that is 40-odd years old and in a depressed neighborhood -- Mr. Johnson was quick to point to portraits of Dr. Dorrance in the chairman's and founders' rooms, as well as a lone Andy Warhol painting -- his Campbell's tomato soup can, of course. Appearing comfortable in his role as strategist, Mr. Johnson expressed enthusiasm at being called back to duty.</p>
        <p>True to form, Mr. Johnson showed impatience with the notion that the company must eventually be sold, arguing that ''only dead fish swim with the current.'' He acknowledged that there was tremendous pressure from Wall Street to consider a combination -- likening the environment to ''a sailor going off the warship in port: they're looking for a friend.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson said Campbell would not be panicked into action. ''We're trying very, very hard to fight back,'' he said, emphasizing that the company had not given up. ''I don't think for a second we're rolling over.''</p>
        <p>Campbell could remain independent, he said, and would weigh its options carefully over coming months. Citing Wrigley, the Chicago chewing-gum maker, as a successful family company, he said, ''I think we are still in control of our destiny.''</p>
        <p>But former executives, analysts and others paint a picture of a family that may find it difficult to pull together to do what is needed to turn  around the company. Some recall that in 1989, after Mr. Dorrance's death, his children, nephews and nieces, disappointed by the company's performance, were bitterly divided over whether to sell out.</p>
        <p>The dispute eventually led to a reorganization that put five family members -- three Dorrance children, John III, Bennett and Mary Alice Malone, and two of their cousins, George S. Strawbridge Jr. and Charlotte Weber -- on the board. Two other cousins, Hope van Beuren and Dorrance Hamilton, formed a voting trust and added Charles H. Mott, who is not a relative, to the board to represent their interests. John III, who has since sold his shares in the company, is no longer a director.</p>
        <p>Arriving at Campbell in 1990, Mr. Johnson, a colorful Australian who had achieved tremendous success at Gerber Products, managed to settle the question of a sale by driving up the stock price. Investors, including the Dorrances, were thrilled at his revitalization of the company -- he slashed costs and brought discipline to its operations, laying off thousands of employees and jettisoning mediocre businesses. The family basked in dividends that now approach some $200 million a year, allowing them to remain aloof from the business.</p>
        <p>The grandchildren, and their children, are informed about the company, Mr. Johnson said; they attend presentations about its strategy and ask questions. ''In this instance,'' as opposed to 1989, he added, ''the family has stayed involved.''</p>
        <p>Family members, who have seen the company go through difficult times before, are willing to take a long view, he said. The company's board ''is more committed to the long run than anybody could imagine because of its special history,'' he said, a reference to the family's commitment to Dr. Dorrance's legacy and their experience a decade ago.</p>
        <p>But family members also leave major decisions to others. ''They are not that engaged,'' said one former executive, who described them as ''never really interested in the details.'' With Mr. Johnson as chief, they had come to expect only good news, he said.</p>
        <p>Aside from flirting with Bestfoods, Campbell has remained stubbornly single as General Mills picked Pillsbury and Philip Morris won Nabisco in the new round of food mergers.</p>
        <p>Nabisco had often been mentioned as a possible partner for Campbell, and Mr. Johnson agreed that the two companies shared strong cash flows, which would let a combined company take on large amounts of debt and generate strong earnings. But he dismissed the notion that such a deal  would have been smart. If Campbell had merged with Nabisco, he said, Campbell's soup business would have stopped playing a vital role.</p>
        <p>Though there may be no shotgun marriage -- at least not yet -- Campbell would be willing to consider some kind of merger, according to Mr. Johnson. He said the company would stay independent not as a goal in itself but only if it was the best way to increase shareholder value. Perhaps as big a consideration, analysts and consultants suggested, is that the family is likely to want stock, not cash, for any sale, for tax reasons, but would be interested in owning a smaller portion of another entity. ''I would imagine,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''that the family would see having a significant role as being of continued importance.''</p>
        <p>There is little consensus about which company may be the right partner. Heinz is often mentioned, given its similar businesses and strong management. But the two companies have been bitter rivals, and buying Campbell may not be the challenge Heinz wants. Unilever might consider a run after it has digested Bestfoods, and Nestle is also a possibility. Procter &amp; Gamble may even make a bid.</p>
        <p>IF Campbell decides it go it alone, it is far from clear that it will be successful. The company still needs a chief executive, since Mr. Johnson is unlikely to tarry too long. While Campbell still controls 74 percent of the nation's soup volume, its unit sales continue to drop, falling 4 percent in the last year. The news hasn't been good in cookies or crackers, either: unit sales declined 5 percent for Pepperidge Farm cookies, and crackers were off slightly, according to Information Resources Inc. Campbell's other major brands include Godiva, Prego and V8.</p>
        <p>''The big danger is you do all of this, and it may not work,'' said Mr. Bivens, the Bear Stearns analyst.</p>
        <p>And, clearly, consumer tastes have changed. ''They basically have the Maxwell House of soup,'' said John McMillan, an analyst at Prudential Securities, referring to the once-dominant brand of coffee that fell victim to changing preferences and chains like Starbucks that spare consumers the bother of brewing their own.</p>
        <p>Despite its well-known brands and dominant market position, Campbell has not kept up with the times, consultants say. It was slow to offer ready-to-eat soup and only recently gave consumers easy-to-open cans.</p>
        <p>The company is ''missing innovation,'' said Gary Stibel, founder of the New England Consulting Group.</p>
        <p>The strategy that served Mr. Johnson so well before -- cutting costs and selling low-margin businesses -- is unlikely to do the trick this time. Although Campbell recently announced more layoffs, there is nearly universal agreement that the company must increase volume. ''We squeezed every nickel in the cost structure,'' said one former executive, who described the task ahead as ''a big, big marketing turnaround.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson says his earlier success at Campbell was based on ''more than just squeezing and hacking.'' But analysts and consultants say the company appears to have invested too little in the development and marketing of its brands.</p>
        <p>''They really haven't come up with anything that has sparked the soup business,'' said Mr. Kolpak of Key Asset Management.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson conceded that Campbell has not backed the right initiatives. ''I think we have tried too hard for growth,'' he said. In introducing products, the company took a scattered approach that cannibalized some of its core business. Its introduction of microwaveable soup, for example, hurt its basic soups. Campbell is now focusing its efforts, introducing, for example, a new tomato noodle soup in the United States that took off in Australia and rolling out easy-to-open, ready-to-serve cans of the popular red-and-white varieties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson also said marketing campaigns had largely been unsuccessful. ''Our talk to the consumer became more fragmented, wasn't as strong, wasn't as clear,'' he said.</p>
        <p>CHASTENED, Campbell is charting some initiatives -- called the fight-back plan -- for this fall. It will devote more effort to big sellers like chicken noodle soup, trying to appeal to consumers by adding more meat and reminding them of soup's value.</p>
        <p>''What you will see this fall is advertising that is very proud, very confident and that celebrates our core equities,'' said F. Martin Thrasher, the president of Campbell  North America.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Johnson did not rule out buying another business, like Keebler, a large acquisition may not happen anytime soon. In the opinion of one former executive, Campbell will wait until it finds a new chief,  because Mr. Johnson ''is not the guy who will ride it out.''</p>
        <p>Analysts also said many potential purchases would cost too much in the current environment, although Campbell could probably take on the necessary debt.</p>
        <p>Campbell has a long way to go to prove itself again, Mr. Johnson acknowledged. ''To return to grace and to run to Wall Street's loud cheering,'' he said, ''will take a back-to-back couple of years of initiatives and innovation and re-proving our vitality and strategies.'' And it will be at least early next year, he said,  before the company can demonstrate the success of some of its latest efforts.</p>
        <p>At Gerber, which also struggled after Mr. Johnson left, the story ended happily once the company was bought in 1994 by what later became Novartis. Descendants of the company's founder, Frank Gerber, profited by tens of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>At Campbell, Mr. Johnson said, the ending will depend on the people running the company. ''Talent is and leadership is, and what you build in the company is how you are going to ensure the future,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It is now up to Mr. Johnson to decide whether Campbell should sell, and even some of his sharpest critics refuse to count him out in finding a way to regain shareholder value. ''While Johnson left his predecessor with a bad hand,'' said Mr. McMillan, the analyst, ''every place he's gone, he's won.'' The Dorrances are certainly betting on him.</p>
