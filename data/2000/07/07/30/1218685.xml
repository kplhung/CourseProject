        <p>Using a Jimi Hendrix performance to sell Pop-Tarts, though distasteful and, to some, sacrilegious, doesn't alter Jimi's artistic presentation. The music hasn't changed.

        <p>I actually heard Mr. Gorelick for the first time the same night Pat Metheny did. As a 20-year-old music student, I was shocked to hear so many out of time, out of tune and harmonically suspect pentatonic licks. Most of the crowd responded on a very base level, cheering him on. During Mr. Metheny's performance, the crowd sat enthralled, having been reached on a truly deep level. That evening was memorable for two reasons: Kenny G showed the potential commercial appeal of instrumental music, and Pat Metheny's performance was the first of more than 100 times I've seen him live. And five years ago, I was lucky enough to sign him to Warner Brothers Records.</p>
