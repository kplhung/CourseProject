        <p>Part of the alternative-country crowd that doesn't get much respect from Nashville, Robbie Fulks is an insurgent singer-songwriter who bites the hand that feeds him. He writes irreverent songs, with wry wordplay, traditional country sentiments and roots-based rock.</p>
        <p>His four albums since 1996 (including his current ''Best of'') have earned him a reputation as the premier writer of anarchistic neo-country music.</p>

        <p>His four albums since 1996 (including his current ''Best of'') have earned him a reputation as the premier writer of anarchistic neo-country music.</p>
        <p>He is more traditional sounding than the country music's current hunkabillies and pop divas. One minute he sounds like Buck Owens, then he's singing an ode to Susannah Hoffs (''That Bangle Girl''). He croons a wicked lounge rendition of John Denver's ''Leaving on a Jet Plane,'' then he's a sinister rocker on ''Roots Rock Weirdos.''</p>
        <p>He performs at 9 p.m. on Thursday night at Maxwell's in Hoboken.</p>
