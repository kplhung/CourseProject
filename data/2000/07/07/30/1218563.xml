        <p>Rick Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New York, is post-everything. Born in 1958, he came along too late to be influenced by the civil rights struggle, the Vietnam War, the 60's, Watergate. The first presidential campaign Lazio volunteered to work on was Gerald Ford's in 1976. This is not just a matter of historical curiosity. Our political life is dominated by figures who came of age in the 60's and whose views bear the mark of these great events, just as the outlook of preceding generations was shaped by the cold war, World War II and the Depression. Think of Hillary Clinton, Lazio's opponent, who was born into a Midwestern Republican family and whose complacent sense of the order of things was upended by the liberal social gospel of her Methodist church. Even Gov. George Pataki, a genial Republican who is an ally of Lazio's -- and with whom Lazio is often compared -- became a Goldwater conservative in the 60's. Large, polarizing events force choices, and those choices create a certain crispness in point of view.</p>
        <p>Rick Lazio is genuinely suspicious of crispness. ''Rick is not just 50-50 on the issues,'' says Peter King, a fellow member of New York's Republican delegation in Congress. ''Within those issues he tends to take the middle position.'' King, a conservative, takes a rather dim view of Lazio's difference-splitting politics; Lazio himself says that his moderate moderateness makes him an effective legislator as well as an appealing candidate.</p>
        <p>Rick Lazio has popped up at an extremely nonideological moment in American history. There are no burning moral questions at the heart of our national politics this election season; there are, in fact, hardly any burning questions at all. Politics right now is not about marshaling forces for change, but about making the fine adjustments that will preserve things more or less as they are.</p>
        <p>Lazio is running to succeed Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the monstre sacre of New York politics, a living summation of the epic battles of the last half-century. Lazio is betting that Moynihan -- his sense of himself and of politics itself -- is already the past.</p>
        <p>On a hot Saturday morning last month, I watched Rick Lazio deliver the commencement address at West Islip High School, a big two-story tan brick structure that looks like every high school built in the 1950's. Lazio is West Islip, class of 1976 -- the school's most famous graduate. He spoke from one end of the football field, with the class seated in blue-and-white gowns before him, the band to his left and the parents and little brothers and sisters broiling away in the grandstands on either side.</p>
        <p>The crowd was almost all white; about half the graduates were Italian-American. Lazio's manner was artlessly modest; he has an excited, high-pitched voice and a vowel-flattening Long Island accent. He talked about his happy boyhood going to the beach with his pals, and eating at the Long River Chinese Restaurant, and clamming in the Great South Bay. (Clamming in the bay has become Lazio shorthand both for ''authentic New Yorker'' and for ''environmentally conscious.'') He worked a few variations on the theme ''dare to dream.'' He told the kids how much their parents loved them. And he closed with a dazzling array of aphorisms: ''Treat others as you would like to be treated. . . . Honesty, loyalty and trust combine to make an honorable life. . . . Be a good child to your parents, and a good parent to your children. . . . Go through life with a crick in your neck from looking backward on the path where you came.'' The speech sounded as if it had been stitched on samplers.</p>
        <p>I got to talking afterward with a silver-blond woman sitting behind me. Her name was Donna Brogan, and it turned out that she had been Lazio's classmate. The conversation went like this:</p>
        <p>''Remember anything particularly noteworthy about him?''</p>
        <p>''Not really. He was just a nice, average guy.''</p>
        <p>''Smart?''</p>
        <p>''Well, maybe a little smarter than usual.''</p>
        <p>''Anything else come to mind?''</p>
        <p>''Not really. He was just a nice, average guy from a nice, average town.''</p>
        <p>There's a clarion call for the voters of New York: vote for Rick Lazio, the candidate from ''Pleasantville.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Lazio comes from the dead center of Long Island. To the west, closer to New York City, is Nassau County, famous for the big-city-style Republican machine that produced Alfonse D'Amato. To the east, at the tip of the island, lie potato fields and the soigne Hamptons. Western Suffolk County, which Lazio represents, is one long chain-store-and-strip-mall suburb, a safe, pleasant and provincial world stretched out along the Long Island Railroad and the Long Island Expressway. The citizens themselves are urban escapees, young families who moved out from Brooklyn and Queens in the 50's and 60's. When I asked Tony Appolaro, the county Republican chairman, to describe Islip, the township that includes West Islip, he said, ''A lot of blue-collar, highly populated areas, very conservative, very strong family values, all Republicans.''</p>
        <p>Lazio grew up in a home-owning, small-business world. His father, Tony, owned a small auto-parts store, and the family -- Rick and three older sisters -- lived in a modest Cape Cod a few blocks from the water. Rick was just another kid biking around town, collecting baseball cards, shooting hoops in the driveway. He showed absolutely no signs of early promise. At West Islip High he was president of the prom committee, not the student government. He attended Vassar College, in Poughkeepsie, but Glen Johnson, the adviser for his thesis in political science, only dimly recalls Lazio, and says that he was ''a perfectly acceptable student.'' The late 70's was not known for student activism, and Lazio and his friends didn't spend much time engaged in passionate political disputes.</p>
        <p>But politics, in a more quotidian sense, had always been part of Lazio's life. His father was a gregarious character, a joiner, and he was a figure in local Republican circles just as he was in the Kiwanis Club, a committeeman and a ubiquitous volunteer who got to drive the big shots around town when they came for fund-raisers. Sometimes Rick would keep him company when he delivered petitions, or go with him to party headquarters on election night. It wasn't conservative Republicanism or plutocratic Republicanism or Rockefeller Republicanism; it was, if anything, small-town, Fourth of July Republicanism. ''I wouldn't say it was real doctrine at all,'' says Lazio. ''It was more like rooting for a team.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, any search for doctrine is in vain. When I asked Lazio about the origin of his political views, he said, ''I think the most dominant beliefs for me are the beliefs that were transferred to me growing up -- the sense of family, watching out for others, of work, of not expecting to get something for nothing but expecting that there will be a sense of responsibility that comes with opportunities.'' Hillary Clinton had pretty much the same values transferred to her, but values this consensual dictate nothing about political views -- and preclude nothing, which is perhaps their virtue in Lazio's mind. Lazio can not only work with anyone, he can also potentially side with anyone. He does not, he says emphatically, have a ''rigid ideology.''</p>
        <p>After Vassar, Lazio enrolled at American University law school in Washington, and when he graduated he returned to West Islip. His father was confined to a wheelchair after a stroke, and Lazio felt that he was needed at home. He took a job as an assistant district attorney and dabbled in local politics on the side. In 1989, soon after he left the D.A.'s office, John Cochrane, the county Republican leader, asked Lazio to run for a seat in the County Legislature. Cochrane says that he saw in Lazio an attractive, well-spoken young man who had been ''brought up with a strong party influence.'' Lazio agreed to run, and beat the Democratic incumbent. That same year, he married Patricia Moriarity, a nurse and the sister of a law school buddy.</p>
        <p>He was a conscientious legislator, along with being handsome and genial, and it quickly became clear that he was destined for larger things. Here, for the first time, Lazio demonstrated an instinct for the main chance. ''He was a cut above the typical county legislator,'' says Patrick Halpin, a Democrat who was serving as county executive when Lazio took office. ''However, he was not one to embrace or advocate a cause. I frankly can't recall a situation where he used any of his political capital to advance a cause.'' Nor, in fact, can anyone. Appolaro, the county chairman, told me that Lazio ''is recognized as someone who listens to his conscience,'' but when I asked for an example, he drew a blank. Lazio developed a reputation for holding onto his vote until the very last moment, which fellow Republicans interpret as painstaking consideration, and Democrats as fear of controversy.</p>
        <p>Lazio's first and only truly extraordinary achievement in politics was his 1992 defeat of Representative Thomas Downey, a Democrat and 18-year incumbent whose seat appeared unassailable. Paul Aniboli, a close friend of Lazio's and at that time the political director of the Republican National Committee, says that he, Lazio and a few others had been struck by how poorly Downey had done against feeble opposition in 1990. Lazio declared in early 1992 and was promptly embraced by the party as an unusually worthy sacrificial lamb.</p>
        <p>Then, in the spring of 1992, the House banking scandal hit, and Downey was found to have bounced 151 checks. ABC News showed Downey on a Jet Ski at an insurance-industry junket. A private poll showed that Lazio went from 25 points down to 25 points up once voters knew about these peccadilloes. Lazio made the scandal the issue, tearing into his immensely better-financed and better-connected opponent. Aniboli says of his friend: ''He is an amiable fellow to shake his hand, but he is a street fighter. He was not afraid to run a difficult campaign.''</p>
        <p>And he beat Downey in what was otherwise a big year for the Democrats. Lazio's career was born, and with it an unassailable confidence in his political talents -- and in his political prospects.</p>
        <p>Rick Lazio has reached the age when his high school classmates are putting on weight and losing hair. Not he; Lazio looks terrific in his white oxford shirts, and he has only the tiniest threads of gray in his thick black hair and an adorable little wave that curls over his forehead. He has finely modeled lips, and he might almost be pretty were it not for the smooshed nose, which looks like a token of combat (but isn't).</p>
        <p>Lazio's air of perpetual youth is not only a matter of looks. He is one of those people who goes through life with the brightness knob turned all the way up; he has George W. Bush's high spirits, but without his sardonic smirk or ironic wit. Lazio has a way of booming ''Good morning!'' -- even to a pack of reporters waiting to jump down his throat -- that puts you in mind of a visitor to an elementary school class. During a farm breakfast he attended late last month, he was given some milk from one of those little cartons that kids get at school. ''Where's Pat?'' he cried, looking around for his wife. ''This is great! She should try some of this.''</p>
        <p>Lazio has been a tremendous relief for Republican leaders who had grown increasingly fretful about Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's rather sullen noncampaign campaign. Lazio is as loyal a party man as Giuliani was solitary and refractory. Last summer, when Lazio and Giuliani were both jockeying for position, Governor Pataki barely made a secret of his dislike for the mayor -- and his fondness for the youngster from Suffolk. Giuliani had not only given the governor innumerable causes for offense, but as Senator he would also plainly challenge Pataki for supremacy in the state party. Lazio would play by the rules. Pataki's aides, who at times talked about the mayor as if he were a dangerous lunatic, made all the right introductions for Lazio when he canvassed for support upstate. Pataki told Lazio, according to Lazio, that he would make ''the best Republican candidate for Senate in a very, very long time.''</p>
        <p>But Lazio obediently dropped out of the race last summer when Pataki felt that he had to support Giuliani. When Lazio jumped back in after Giuliani, beset with prostate cancer and a girlfriend, announced two months ago that he would not run for the Senate, Pataki immediately made it clear that he was in Lazio's camp. Other potential challengers, including Peter King, never had a chance.</p>
        <p>By the time Lazio entered the race, Hillary Clinton's campaign was finally looking like a well-oiled, if not terribly effective, machine. Lazio had to create a campaign staff, a campaign headquarters, a message and a schedule on the fly -- and all while continuing to show up in Congress. Week by week, the campaign has been getting less impromptu and more professional. Lazio surprised New York Republicans by passing over Kieran Mahoney and Arthur Finkelstein, who together had masterminded Pataki's gubernatorial victories and Al D'Amato's successful Senate runs, but who were also associated with D'Amato's loss to Charles Schumer in 1998. Instead, Lazio hired as his media adviser and chief strategist Mike Murphy, who engineered John McCain's presidential bid. Lazio already had $3.5 million in the bank when he jumped into the race, and he has since raised another $4.5 million. (Raising money to run against Hillary Clinton is not exactly uphill work.) And he very quickly pulled even with Clinton in the polls, in spite of the fact that few voters had any clear idea what he stood for or even who he was. A recent poll showed the candidates tied; 40 percent of voters viewed Clinton negatively, while only 13 percent viewed Lazio negatively.</p>
        <p>Not being Hillary is a central element of Lazio's appeal. When I first spoke to him last summer, with Giuliani still very much in the picture, he was planning to offer himself as a kind of safe harbor for those who couldn't stand either the mayor or the first lady. ''A pleasant person that is nonpolarizing,'' he said, ''is very difficult to demonize.''</p>
        <p>Being undemonizable would seem like a negative virtue, especially when the predecessors in the office to which you aspire are such large and demonizable figures as Bobby Kennedy and Pat Moynihan and even Alfonse D'Amato; but Lazio's modest conception of himself is one of his strongest selling points. Under attack recently for allegedly turning a $16,000 profit by trading on inside information -- the S.E.C. is now conducting an investigation -- Lazio looked into the camera and declared, ''All I can say is I'm an average, middle-class guy.'' He had, he said, talked to Pat, and she had said: ''You know what? We're honest, decent people. I clean my own house.''</p>
        <p>When he travels these days with Pat and their two daughters, Molly, 8, and Kelsey, 7, which he does as often as possible, Lazio presents a family-values tableau that Clinton cannot match. The Lazios project the air of unfeigned happiness that the Clintons themselves never quite managed even in their best days.</p>
        <p>And then there is Lazio's own emollient magic. In the middle of a campaign swing across central and northern New York earlier this month, the candidate stopped at the Bernardino senior citizens complex in Syracuse to talk about the need for federal support for seniors' housing. Jane O'Hea, a feisty 73-year-old, asked Lazio where he stood on abortion -- perhaps the only thing approaching a burning issue for some citizens -- and Lazio explained that he was pro-choice, though he opposed ''partial birth'' abortion. Following the speech, as well as a cameo appearance by Molly and Kelsey that elicited the most heartfelt sighs, O'Hea made her way over on her walker, looked Lazio straight in the eye and said: ''I don't like your stand on pro-choice, O.K.? The fetus has a soul, and it's murder as far as I'm concerned. I get quite emotional about it.''</p>
        <p>Lazio bowed his head and murmured, ''It's an emotional issue, and I absolutely understand that.'' O'Hea brightened, and as she turned her walker around, she chirped, ''And you're very nice, and I'll probably vote for you anyway.''</p>
        <p>Lazio is happy to talk about less divisive issues like the economy and education. He favors a ''balanced approach'' of spending restraint and tax cuts, and he complains of the ''Washington arrogance'' of interfering with what should be local decisions and supports charter schools, vouchers and reforms in teacher training and licensing. But Lazio is probably slightly to the right of the average New York State voter on these issues, so he tends to soft-pedal his views and focus on the area where he has a leg up on Clinton: his legislative experience.</p>
        <p>Lazio speaks often of the many things he has done for New Yorkers in his eight years as a legislator -- creating work incentives for the disabled, reforming public housing, making prescription-drug coverage available for seniors, expanding access to cancer care. In recent weeks he has taken to framing what is meant to be a rhetorical question: ''Can you name me one single thing that Mrs. Clinton has done for New York?'' Lazio is careful not to use the word ''carpetbagger,'' but he never fails to observe that he has pumped gas in New York, paid taxes in New York and waited on checkout lines in New York. He seems almost to be daring Clinton to claim that she has gone clamming in South Bay.</p>
        <p>Indeed, pleasant though he is, Lazio has not hesitated to run a ''difficult'' campaign against Clinton. He links her name to the word ''mud'' as often as possible. And he recently responded to an ancient and dubiously founded tale of an anti-Semitic remark by Clinton by saying, ''I don't know who to believe.'' Lazio is plainly hoping that the election will ultimately be a referendum on Hillary Clinton. Given his low profile and her consistent high negatives in the polls, this is not an unreasonable expectation. After Syracuse, Lazio climbed back on the Mainstream Express, as his bus is subtly called, and headed off to Buffalo, where he traded his navy suit for a cranberry polo shirt and khakis and waded through a throng of jolly, beer-drinking white-collar workers engaged in a modest postwork bacchanal called Thursday on the Square. Very few of them had any idea who Lazio was, but it scarcely seemed to matter.</p>
        <p>As he introduced himself to a knot of young women, one turned to the other and said, ''He's got better legs.'' Lazio pressed onward and stuck out his hand and introduced himself to a middle-aged man holding a beer in a plastic cup. The man said, ''You the one that's gonna beat Hillary?''</p>
        <p>''I am,'' Lazio said, smiling.</p>
        <p>''Then God bless you; I'd vote for you a hundred times if I could.'' And as the man wandered off, he muttered, ''Kill the bitch.''</p>
        <p>Hillary Clinton spent the early part of the summer working to define Rick Lazio before he could define himself. Her goal was to sell the argument that Lazio is too conservative for swing voters, that he is an amiable character who takes his marching orders from a right-wing Republican leadership in the House. This argument appears to have made absolutely no headway so far, though it turns out to contain a fair amount of truth.</p>
        <p>Lazio arrived in Congress in 1993, before there was a Republican majority in the House. He quickly came to be identified with the group of moderate Republicans from the Northeast who found a lot to like in President Clinton's New Democratic agenda. He was one of only 40 Republicans who voted for the Family and Medical Leave Act in 1993, and the following year he voted with the president 72 percent of the time, which placed him third in that category among House Republicans. Congressional Quarterly's concise description of Lazio was, ''He is a confirmed moderate who expects to wind up among the Democrats' most consistent allies.''</p>
        <p>Lazio's world was transformed by the election of 1994, which vaulted the Republicans to majority status in both houses. Now the Republicans were dominating the legislative process, and all of the moderates began to vote with the party more often than they had before. In 1995 Lazio voted with the president only 34 percent of the time, which represents the largest swing of any of the moderates. I asked Lazio if he had come to see the merits of the ''opportunity society'' conservatism that Jack Kemp, Newt Gingrich and others were championing at the time -- a dynamic species of Republicanism he had never encountered in Suffolk County. Lazio probably regarded this as a trick question. ''I don't think so,'' he said carefully. He added that he eschews ''harsh partisanship'' and judges each bill on its merits.</p>
        <p>An alternative view is that Lazio recognized that he could advance within the new leadership by being the kind of moderate whom conservatives could work with. He had already made a name for himself in G.O.P. circles merely by beating Tom Downey; and then he had come to Newt Gingrich's attention when he went toe to toe with Speaker Tom Foley on provisions of the crime bill, which the Democrats were dearly trying to pass in 1994. Lazio was eager for advancement; but unlike most ambitious people, he had the kind of anodyne personality that muted conflict. He was an insider and a team player. Lazio says that his own natural tendency is ''to build communication among people with diverse views and to try to get people to reason together.'' One person who has worked closely with Lazio says more pointedly, ''He's not about to irritate people with a gratuitous press conference or even an off-the-record comment about another member.'' Lazio was a bridge waiting to be used.</p>
        <p>Good things began happening to him as soon as the new leadership took over. Tom DeLay, the new whip, made Lazio a deputy whip responsible for counting heads in the moderate group. As a freshman, Lazio was given a seat on the prestigious Banking Committee, and in 1995 he became chairman of the Housing Subcommittee; in 1997, Speaker Gingrich granted Lazio's request to keep his position while he also joined the Commerce Committee, despite party rules that limit members to one of those assignments. And the following year, after he rallied to the side of the embattled majority leader, Dick Armey, a figure whom many moderates had come to view with as much alarm as they did Gingrich, Armey made Lazio a deputy majority leader, thus making him the one avowed moderate in the inner circle of leadership.</p>
        <p>The Northeastern moderates, known as ''the Lunch Bunch,'' had a representative in leadership meetings; Lazio was not only the first of these ambassadors, he was also asked to remain after his term had ended. The moderates say that Lazio's gift for getting along with absolutely everyone, unto the veriest bomb-thrower, served their cause well. ''He has a directness that doesn't carry an overlay of intensity,'' says Representative Nancy Johnson of Connecticut. ''But he acts with intensity.''</p>
        <p>Sherwood Boehlert of New York says that, despite misgivings, he voted for Armey to remain as majority leader in part because Lazio assured him that ''our voice would be heard in the majority leader's office.'' And Lazio, he says, was as good as his word. Many of the moderates felt that they had to pass minimum-wage legislation in 1996, but Armey had said that he would resist an increase ''with every fiber of my being.'' Ed Gillespie, Armey's former press secretary, says that Lazio ''explained to Armey that when you represent a district with heavy union membership, minimum wage is a key issue, and he explained how you could do it in a way that the more conservative members could live with.'' Lazio then helped put together a compromise that paired a wage increase with a tax credit for the small businesses that would have to bear much of the cost for the increase. Gillespie says that ''Armey is very fond of Lazio and very loyal to him.''</p>
        <p>Lazio has served in Congress during a time of almost unprecedented turbulence inside the Republican Party. The party tore itself apart over the consequences of the 1995 government shutdown and the impeachment of President Clinton; Gingrich was ultimately deposed, and Armey came close. The moderates and the leadership have been at war, and yet Lazio has never lost his bona fides with either side. This is a sign either of extraordinary political deftness or of an unwillingness to stand up and be counted. Even Lazio's supporters say that he rarely engages in debate, and Peter King, the combative Nassau County Republican, observes: ''Rick's natural instinct is to not create tension or to not exacerbate tension. On the one hand, you could say that he's a conciliator. On the other side, you could say that he shies away from confrontation.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, when I asked Christopher Shays, a moderate from Connecticut and a big Lazio booster, to tell me about a time Lazio had put himself on the line, he was just as stumped as Tony Appolaro had been. ''I'll get back to you,'' he said. But he didn't.</p>
        <p>Like almost all Republicans, Lazio voted for most of the articles in Gingrich's Contract With America (8 out of 10) and voted for the G.O.P. budget bills that ultimately led to the government shutdown. But he did not join the increasingly noisy revolt against the leadership after the fiasco of the 1996 election. Both Peter King and Michael Forbes, who represents the eastern tip of Long Island, publicly criticized Gingrich and were thoroughly marginalized as a consequence, Forbes so much so that he ultimately switched to the Democratic Party. Lazio supported Gingrich to the end, enhancing his influence and preserving his effectiveness.</p>
        <p>Forbes now speaks very bitterly about Lazio. ''Rick has been on a singular track to advance himself,'' he says. ''We're all ambitious, but there's a certain code you're trying to follow. The guy does have this almost unethical approach to things.''</p>
        <p>One cannot, of course, easily draw the line between a prudent circumspection and unprincipled opportunism. On the impeachment issue, for example, Lazio charted his usual tortuous course. For many months he took the position, favored by many Democrats and some Republicans, that the president deserved censure rather than impeachment. He repeated this view to many constituents in Suffolk and to the editorial board of Newsday, the Long Island daily. The White House had him down as a definite censure vote, though he remained officially undecided.</p>
        <p>And then, a few days before the vote, when DeLay had begun ratcheting up the pressure on the undecided, Lazio called a news conference to announce that he would vote for two of the four impeachment counts, thus allowing him to be on both sides of the most contentious issue of his political career. Shays, who voted against impeachment, says that Lazio ''agonized over what was the right vote, not the political vote.'' On the other hand, some Lazio supporters were disgusted; a Suffolk businesswoman told me that she had taken the extreme step of volunteering for Hillary Clinton's campaign. (She asked that her name not be printed to avoid repercussions with her employer.)</p>
        <p>The central questions about Lazio's Congressional career are these: What price has he paid for his privileged position with the House leadership? Has his ambition led him, as Michael Forbes argues, to compromise his principles? Certainly Lazio's voting record has remained generally moderate and includes many votes against leadership. He voted for the Brady law, which mandated a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases; he is generally considered a friend to the environmental movement; he has voted for full financing for the National Endowment for the Arts (though he has also voted at other times to sharply cut arts financing); he favors campaign-finance reform; he opposes ending affirmative action in higher education.</p>
        <p>But Lazio has also voted for deep cuts in social programs, to eliminate the Department of Education, for a ban on homosexuals in the military. Many of his fellow moderates cast the same votes; what is intriguing about Lazio's record is a pattern of voting with the leadership and against virtually the entire body of moderates, especially on the symbolic and social issues that most of the moderates find embarrassing, but that conservatives like Armey and DeLay take so seriously.</p>
        <p>A striking example, which his opponent has already begun to harp on, is abortion. Lazio considers himself in favor of abortion rights, as he told Jane O'Hea. At the same time, he regularly votes for restrictions on access to abortion and opposes the use of Medicaid to pay for abortions. This is not an uncommon position, but Lazio has also voted for anti-abortion measures that virtually all pro-abortion-rights legislators in both parties opposed. In 1999, for example, he voted in favor of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, a personal favorite of Dick Armey's, which would have made it a separate offense harm or kill a child in utero, even if the perpetrator had no idea that the women in question was pregnant. If the fetus -- in any stage of development'' -- died, the accused would be charged with murder, which is to say that the unborn child's life status would be equal to the mother's even if it was only moments after conception.</p>
        <p>It may be possible to reconcile a vote for such a bill while remaining in favor of abortion rights, but it's not easy to imagine how, so I recently asked Lazio, as we were sitting in the waiting room at a private airfield in Buffalo, to explain to me his general views on abortion. It's not in Lazio's nature to have general views on something, and the subject plainly made him uncomfortable; as he spoke he kept trailing off. ''I think what's really important about the issue is to try to come at it with a sense of respect for people who have passionate views on both sides,'' he said. ''I don't make either camp happy all the time, I don't make either camp unhappy all the time, just because I'm looking at this issue and trying to find the most reasonable outcome for me.''</p>
        <p>And what about the Unborn Victims of Violence Act?</p>
        <p>''I don't think that's what it said at all,'' Lazio said, when I explained the language of the bill. In a later discussion I read him the exact language, and Lazio said that ''many people who are pro-choice support the idea that there is status to the fetus.'' He also pointed out that the legislation did not criminalize abortion itself.</p>
        <p>Julie Piscitelli, spokeswoman for the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, argues that Lazio is ''doing the minimum so that he can say to the sizable pro-choice majority in New York, 'Hey, I'm in favor of choice,' but then he's not really being there when he's needed, not really being pro-choice.'' Michael Forbes, who is himself unabashedly anti-abortion, says, ''Rick Lazio is no pro-life person; that's just Rick Lazio in pursuit of the Conservative Party line.'' Or perhaps, since Lazio could have satisfied the Conservatives simply by voting against ''partial birth'' abortion, it was Lazio currying favor with Armey and his army.</p>
        <p>Lazio's time in Congress is littered with such votes. In 1998, for example, he was virtually the only moderate who voted for the so-called Religious Liberty Amendment, a Constitutional amendment that stated, ''The people's right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage or traditions on public property, including schools, shall not be infringed.'' The amendment would have overturned half a century of Supreme Court jurisprudence and enshrined a wholly new standard of church-state relations in the Constitution.</p>
        <p>Lazio also startled Republican supporters of a patients' bill of rights earlier this year when he voted against a bipartisan bill and for two other versions that leadership had permitted to be offered as alternatives. The insurance industry violently opposed giving patients the right to sue, and the alternative bills offered patients a far more circumscribed access to the courts. Lazio says that the bipartisan bill would have led to ''unlimited lawsuits,'' which in turn would have caused employers to limit costs by dropping people from the rolls. But 68 Republicans voted for the measure, including many out-and-out conservatives, as well as all of the legislators who had practiced medicine. The bill passed easily (though a Senate version remains stalled). Lazio's vote was seen as an act of loyalty to the leadership.</p>
        <p>Lazio's own specialty in the House has been housing, an unrewarding subject that very few lawmakers, and scarcely any Republicans, even try to score points on. Lazio is considered a standout even by people who can barely bring themselves to praise Republicans. Irene Baldwin, executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, says that Lazio has stood up to Republican attempts to slash the budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and to weaken the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act, which prohibits redlining by banks. Other housing advocates praise Lazio for his role in financing for the homeless, as well as in providing housing for senior citizens and the disabled. The housing issue has generally allowed Lazio to show the pragmatic, mildly reformist species of Republicanism with which he arrived in Washington.</p>
        <p>Lazio's reputation as both a moderate and a legislative craftsman rest on a massive public-housing reform bill that passed in 1998, and that achieved the extraordinary distinction of being embraced equally by the White House and the Republican House leadership. But Lazio's role in passing the legislation does not entirely bear out the claims made on his behalf.</p>
        <p>In 1996, Republicans introduced bills in the House and Senate to reform public housing. Both bills addressed the central problem of public housing by allowing housing authorities to reduce the high concentration of the very poor, by holding failing authorities to specified standards and by consolidating an array of programs into a few block grants. The Senate bill, which was broadly similar to a reform measure the Democrats had introduced the previous term, was unanimously approved by committee.</p>
        <p>Lazio's House bill, on the other hand, provoked ferocious partisan debate. It would have deregulated rents, placing housing units out of reach of many poor tenants. In addition, Lazio seemed to take the welfare reform legislation that had just passed as his model, for the House bill also would have required tenants to adopt a ''personal improvement program'' and allowed authorities to evict tenants who failed to satisfy the terms of a new ''community work requirement.''</p>
        <p>Lazio has said that his favorite New York senator from the past is Robert Wagner, the great New Deal liberal, father of public housing and author of the 1937 act that created the federally financed public housing system. But in a later version of his housing bill, Lazio proposed repealing the 1937 act. Lazio says that since Wagner ''couldn't in his wildest dreams have imagined the economic and social problems'' that have come with public housing, he'd like to think that Wagner would have supported repeal.</p>
        <p>And yet both Republican and Democratic aides involved with the legislation say that repeal was wholly unnecessary and could have served no purpose save the symbolic -- to take a scalp from the New Deal liberalism that Lazio professes to respect but that the Sun Belt conservatives who ran the Republican Party despised. Indeed, Lazio's bill seemed written as a model for the radical restructuring of the relationship between the government and the poor that the Contract With America had prescribed. It was the Senate legislation that was pragmatic; Lazio's could almost be called rigidly ideological. As one aide says: ''There were five parties to the legislation -- the Republicans and Democrats in the House, the Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and the Administration. Four parties were in broad agreement throughout the process. The outlyer was Lazio.'' Caught between his pragmatic bridge-building temperament and his wish to shine before the House leadership, Lazio seems to have chosen the latter.</p>
        <p>The legislation kept stalling because Lazio refused to compromise with Senate Republicans. Throughout the winter of 1997 and the following spring, Senator Connie Mack, the Florida Republican who led the Joint Economic Committee, held a series of meetings with Lazio. Normally such meetings are conducted at the staff level. ''This was unprecedented,'' says a Republican aide; ''I've never seen anything like it.'' Both Mack and Alfonse D'Amato, who also sat on the committee and took a keen interest in housing issues, were growing increasingly frustrated with Lazio's intransigence and his insistence on symbolic issues. D'Amato was so disgusted that he stopped talking to Lazio altogether. (The relationship has remained very strained.)</p>
        <p>In the end, Lazio gave way on one pet issue after another. The features that distinguished Lazio's bill from the Senate bill, and from the old Democratic legislation, largely evaporated, though a few elements remained, including a requirement that tenants not covered by welfare reform -- which is to say, very few of them -- be required to work eight hours a months. It was generally agreed that Lazio had delayed the bill for a year, to almost no ultimate purpose.</p>
        <p>Still, the bill that finally emerged from this agonizing and dilatory process was widely welcomed. The administration took credit for the bill, and so did Lazio. Indeed, Lazio held a news conference that revealed how very high the stakes had been for the Republican leadership. Standing with Tom DeLay and Dick Armey, Lazio declared, ''Who says the Republicans don't have an urban policy?''Rick Lazio's distinguishing feature may well be audacity. He's not audacious in the way of, say, Peter King, who openly criticizes his own party and ensures himself thereby an almost unlimited supply of press attention. Lazio is not, God knows, gadfly material. He is, rather, audacious in a way that is perfectly in keeping with his genial, unobtrusive nature, his modest gifts and his single-minded focus on the goal before him. Though his temperament in many ways resembles that of George W. Bush, it is well to keep in mind that Lazio's father supplied him with far fewer advantages in life than did Bush's. Lazio has had to succeed on his own, and because his native talents are scarcely outsize, it is his ambition that has seen him through. Lazio has always been something of an upstart; it took an upstart's moxie to run against Tom Downey, to slug it out with Speaker Foley, to hold up the legislative process while he quarreled with the upper house. And if Lazio weren't audacious, he wouldn't be running right now.</p>
        <p>Lazio has been thinking about this race since November 1998, when Chuck Schumer toppled Alfonse D'Amato. ''We talked about it the night Al D'Amato lost,'' says one of Lazio's advisers. ''In fact, it was probably within minutes of the polls closing.'' D'Amato would no longer be sucking up Republican money and would be far less capable of doing him harm. Of course, New York's other incumbent at the time was Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who had traditionally run up enormous electoral margins and was widely considered impervious to challenge -- as Tom Downey had once been. ''Nobody in his right mind would have run against Moynihan,'' this adviser says, ''but Rick wanted to do it.'' And when Moynihan dropped out, Lazio was fully prepared to challenge Giuliani in a primary until Pataki called him -- the day before he was to announce his candidacy -- to say that he would be publicly supporting the mayor.</p>
        <p>And Lazio was ready to run even though he knew that a loss would bring to an end the Congressional career he has cultivated with such care. I asked Lazio if his upset victory over Downey had made him feel that he could beat anyone. He demurred, as he does at all suggestions that hint at grandiosity, but he said, ''One thing that race left me with is the sense that you can't be too intimidated by poll numbers.''</p>
        <p>Lazio is obviously not intimidated, though it's also true that he's playing in a much bigger and more public arena than he ever has before. He hasn't had a seriously contested race since 1992. One of Lazio's great problems will be convincing voters that he is grown-up enough to be a senator: New Yorkers do not want to feel that they're replacing Pat Moynihan with Beaver Cleaver. And Lazio cannot afford to dissipate his family-values advantage, which might well happen should the S.E.C. investigation of his trading patterns turn up anything untoward.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Lazio may succeed in parrying Hillary Clinton's ideological thrusts and still be left with questions about his character. This seems odd, since character would appear to be precisely what has taken Lazio so far. But that's not quite right; Lazio's great gift -- and George W.'s, too -- is not character but personality. Lazio, like Bush, is an ingratiating fellow, modest and friendly, universally welcoming. He seems genuinely to live inside his sugary aphorisms. But voters tend to reserve the word ''character'' to describe how a candidate behaves at moments of difficulty. It's not enough, and perhaps not even necessary, for the people we elect to be good children to their parents and good parents to their children. They have to make hard choices; and Lazio, the man who admires Dick Armey and Robert Wagner, may still have something to prove in that regard.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps he doesn't. If voters no longer feel that they're entrusting large choices to politicians -- and perhaps they don't -- then character may well be a thing of the past, too.</p>
