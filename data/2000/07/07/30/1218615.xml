        <p>WHEN Leonard de Paur became Lincoln Center's director of community relations in 1970, two things concerned him: the lack of community participation in the center's activities and the vast, empty plazas.</p>
        <p>As a black conductor who had broken down racial barriers in music throughout his distinguished career, he was not about to accept the status quo. In short order, he created a program that solved both problems and now entertains New Yorkers every summer -- Lincoln Center Out of Doors. The extravagant festival of free dance, music and theater, this year titled Celebrate Good Times, starts on Saturday and runs through Aug. 29. The public quickly responded to de Paur's revolutionary idea, flocking to Lincoln Center in August to watch both the famous and the unknown local artists perform under an open sky; attendance now reaches 200,000 every summer.</p>
        <p>''The festival started as community outreach,'' said Jane Moss, vice president for programming at Lincoln Center, ''and it's still strongly connected with New York's communities. Artistic director Jenneth Webster's achievement is having given it a distinctive artistic identity.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Webster, who has been in charge for nearly 20 years, believes a chief benefit of the festival is that so many artists are exposed to one another's work. ''I don't know where else you get so much variety,'' she said, citing some of the highlights among this year's more than 100 performances: the celebrated Indian singer Ali Akbar Khan, a Taiwanese dance performance accompanied by a tea ceremony and Pauline Oliveros's musical tour of seven ancient cities, complete with rock bands, soothsayers and Tibetan lamas.</p>
        <p>Established choreographers like it for their own reasons. Paul Taylor compares it to a joyous street fair. And David Parsons, whose troupe performs at the festival for the first time this year, said, ''I'm always after the largest possible public.''</p>
        <p>As the city's residents left on their annual vacations early this month, participants in the festival's dance concerts worked up a sweat in studios all over town while artistic directors mulled over repertory and dealt with costumes and music.</p>
        <p>Not that they would have it any other way. For many of them, it's the rare chance to show off their talents to sizable audiences in a series that boasts both big-name artists like the Paul Taylor Dance Company and relatively unknown troupes representative of New York's diverse population.</p>
        <p>For instance, there is the 25-member Harambee Dance Company established by Frank W. Molloy 3rd, 35, and his wife, Sandella Molloy, 33, the artistic director and choreographer, in their native Charleston, S.C., in 1993. They hoped to share their vision of African dance with a wide public -- harambee means ''let's pull together'' in Swahili -- and moved to New York four years ago for more opportunities.</p>
        <p>Sitting in a big, airy studio in Harlem, waiting to begin rehearsal, the Molloys report that things weren't that simple. ''People expected authentic re-creations,'' Mr. Molloy says, ''although that was never our intention.''</p>
        <p>While they both studied dance in Ghana when Mr. Molloy was in the Peace Corps in 1988 and regularly revisit Africa, they're much more interested in capturing its spirit than in copying specific movements. ''I add moves from hip-hop and Southern hand clapping and foot stomping,'' Ms. Molloy says. ''We want to show how our way of life connects with the African.'' Their son, Frank, 8, who drums along with his father and five others, insists vigorously, ''Well, it does.'' Purists may wish the Harambee Dance Company duplicated African dances, but audiences at the city's public schools and libraries and at the Bronx Zoo are definitely happy with the troupe as it is. In the last two years, it has put on 51 shows just at the Bronx Zoo.</p>
        <p>When the dancers show up, the women in long skirts with vibrant African patterns, Ms. Molloy takes them through exercises that combine stretching, strengthening -- sit-ups and push-ups -- and a series of bravura jumps, calling on their backgrounds in a variety of disciplines. The lead dancer, Vanessa Faye, whose 3-year-old son, Babacar, races around the studio in time to the drums, specializes in Senegalese dance.</p>
        <p>''I use their individual strengths,'' says Ms. Molloy, as her group forms two diagonals, hands on hips, and struts across the floor. ''Don't look like chickens,'' she cautions, joining them in the dance called ''Harmony,'' swaying to the floor, her arms flowing around her like water. Then the dancers make a circle, each one taking a turn in the center. When it comes his time, the only male dancer, Yahi-I Tafari, dreadlocks flying, jumps in like a lion attacking prey, the beat driving him on. Soon the floor is shaking with the pounding of drums and feet. Two hours later they're still going strong, and promise to do so until their festival appearance on Aug. 25.</p>
        <p>In a nondescript office building in midtown, headquarters of another troupe, the 10-year-old Korean Traditional Performing Arts Association, dancers and musicians prepare for their festival appearances on Saturday and Aug. 20 without their director, the folk musician and dancer Sue Yeon Park, 46, who is in Korea buying instruments and costume material. The room is small but cheerful, with gleaming wood floors and a whole array of elaborate, hand-painted drums lining one wall. A dancer goes through a bag full of fierce masks, trying them on for effect. Four of his female colleagues, in long flowing skirts, diaphanous scarves attached to their wrists, assemble in the center of the room to begin a section of a gentle harvest dance, led by the teacher Chang Soo Kim and accompanied by musicians playing drums, a large gong and a zither.</p>
        <p>Following Mr. Kim, the dancers curve their arms in arcs as if gathering rice -- the repertory consists almost solely of works celebrating agricultural life and ritual Buddhist dances. This dance is quite unlike the thunderous processional that opens their outdoor performances. ''Much too loud to practice for a long time inside,'' says Mr. Kim, who explains that it's especially popular with ''the little kids who play the drums,'' many of them Korean adoptees from Camp Friendship in New Jersey, regular performers with the 30-member group.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Harambee Dance Company, the Korean association wants to preserve traditional dances and has found receptive audiences at schools and at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully and Avery Fisher halls. ''We're not as explicit as Westerners in our expression of feelings in our music and dance,'' says the dancer Jennifer Yim. ''But if you take time, you see the beauty.''</p>
        <p>Whether seeking to invent a new style or to keep an old one alive, the overriding mission of these companies is to gain bigger audiences, not easy in a city as culturally competitive as New York. What Lincoln Center Out of Doors offers them is the opportunity to build a following outside their own communities, which was the goal of de Paur, who died in 1998. Anthony Rodriguez, 25, artistic director of the three-year-old, 20-member La Santa Luz (Holy Light) Dance Company, dreams especially big. ''I want to do for Hispanics,'' he says, ''what Alvin Ailey did for African-Americans.''</p>
        <p>He's rehearsing for his troupe's Aug. 16 performance in a studio at LaGuardia High School on the West Side, where he teaches, rather than at the troupe's base at the Police Athletic League in the Bronx, because his studio there is flooded. He grew up in the Bronx and studied at the Performing Arts High School and Ballet Hispanico and, as he got older, danced until dawn in clubs for fun, the origin of his penchant for house music. Inspired by a deaf sister, he incorporates sign language into much of his work, calling his dance style ''todasi,'' a word he coined to mean to dance and to sign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez's outfit -- red headscarf, white T-shirt and mid-calf black sweat pants -- starts the dancers giggling. ''You look like a pirate,'' says Marlyn Ortiz, who first danced with him when she was 6 and, like the other members of the company, is familiar with ballet, tap, flamenco, hip-hop and Latin, modern and African dance.</p>
        <p>Smiling, he switches on the tape, the hypnotic ''Hyperballad'' sung by the Icelandic pop star Bjork, for the first section of his ''Hyperballet,'' a sensation when the company performed it last year at the Kit Kat Club, the original venue of ''Cabaret.'' More recently, the troupe took part in the New York Hip-Hop Theater Festival at P. S. 122 last month.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ortiz and the dancer Shane Mercado walk forward, hips swinging, arms akimbo, only to spring apart suddenly and do back flips in opposite directions, all to an electric, jazzy rhythm. Then moments later, the pace slows as Mr. Mercado takes Ms. Ortiz's hand and pulls her into a tender embrace. ''Make it sweet,'' Mr. Rodriguez requests, not about to let them leave for at least another hour.</p>
        <p>Do they mind spending hot July days holed up in a studio? ''Not at all,'' Ms. Ortiz says. ''Rehearsal feels like coming home.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  July 30, 2000, Sunday  An article on Page 9 of Arts &amp; Leisure today about the Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival misstates its closing date and the tenure of Jenneth Webster as artistic director. The festival ends on Aug. 27, not 29; Ms. Webster has been there 11 years, not 20.</p>
        <p>The article also misstates the occupation of a performer, Ali Akbar Khan. He is a sarod player, not a singer.</p>
