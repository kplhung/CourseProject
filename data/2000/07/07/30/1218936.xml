        <p>A young mother and her 3-year-old son died in a fierce fire in their basement apartment in Queens early yesterday after she escaped the blaze with her boyfriend and an infant, and then ran back in to save the toddler, the police said.</p>
        <p>After the woman, Bibi Zorina Khan, 23, went back into the apartment in the two-story wood-frame house at 133-29 131st Street, in South Ozone Park, a wall of flames apparently kept her and the boy, Faiaz Khan, from getting out, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Khan and her boyfriend, Puran Mohammed, also 23, were initially able to get out with their 3-month-old daughter after the fire broke out about 5:45 a.m. But Ms. Khan ran back inside to get her son, said Lt. Stephen Biegel, a Police Department spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mohammed, a livery-cab dispatcher, and the baby were treated at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center for minor injuries and released, said Firefighter Vito Berretta, a Fire Department spokesman. The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>
