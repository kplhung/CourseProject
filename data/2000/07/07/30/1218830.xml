        <p>THE announcement this month that De Beers Consolidated Mines would retreat from its 70-year-old practice of controlling prices by hoarding the world's diamonds and become more selective in where it buys its gems sent reverberations through diamond markets from Antwerp to Tel Aviv.</p>
        <p>De Beers disclosed that, among other things, it planned to reduce its $3.9 billion stockpile of uncut diamonds to about $2.5 billion by the end of next year.</p>
        <p>But the strategic change in the way the world's largest trader of uncut diamonds does business does not mean consumers will see a sudden abundance of engagement rings at cubic zirconia prices, industry analysts say. De Beers wants to quell concerns about the provenance of its diamonds, they say, but also wants to build demand for them by advertising the stones as branded luxuries in a new and aggressive campaign.</p>
        <p>From its trading headquarters in London, De Beers also promised to cut ties with any of its 125 major trading partners that trafficked in stones originating in war zones. The partners would be required to guarantee that they do not.</p>
        <p>De Beers, the South African mining company that controls about two-thirds of the trade in uncut diamonds, has come under increasing pressure lately, after disclosures that, to help prop up prices and control supplies, it bought millions of dollars of diamonds from rebels in Angola to add to the company's bulky stockpile.</p>
        <p>So-called conflict diamonds from warn-torn parts of Africa are being sold by rebels and some armies to buy weapons; human rights groups and several world governing bodies have protested. This month, the United Nations Security Council imposed a global ban on diamond exports from Sierra Leone, where the stones have helped finance a brutal war.</p>
        <p>Eli Haas, president of ENH International Inc., a diamond trading company in New York, said last week that he expected to see a steady decline in the sale of conflict diamonds, which account for an estimated 4 percent of the market. ''As the new protocols get into effect, that number will continue to drop,'' he said, adding, ''I don't know that it will drop to zero.''</p>
        <p>Others were less optimistic. One diamond wholesaler in New York said he was skeptical of De Beers's ability to police traders. ''In our industry, any way they can make a buck, they will,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the months ahead, consumers are likely to see a profusion of ads  not only telling them that a diamond is forever, a longtime De Beers slogan, but also asking them to look for the gemstone equivalent of the union label. De Beers's trading partners -- cutters, polishers and dealers -- were asked to increase their advertising budgets to promote consumer demand for diamonds.</p>
        <p>De Beers diamonds will carry the name Diamond Trading Company, or D.T.C., as a guarantee to retailers that the diamonds were mined under humane work conditions from reputable mines, said Joan Parker, the director of the Diamond Information Center run by J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency for De Beers.</p>
        <p>The D.T.C. monogram, with its accompanying logo called the ''forevermark,'' will show up on advertisements, though not necessarily on the jewelry products themselves. The retailer will know that the diamonds meet the standards ''and be able to respond to the consumer when asked,'' Ms. Parker said.</p>
        <p>So far, jewelry shop owners have not been fielding many questions about conflict diamonds anyway.</p>
        <p>''If you asked 10 shoppers in a Zales today if they are concerned about buying blood diamonds, nine of them would say: 'Excuse me? What are you talking about?' '' said Kenneth M. Gassman Jr., a jewelry industry analyst for Davenport &amp; Company in Richmond, Va.</p>
        <p>In fact, diamond jewelry sales have risen in the United States in the last few years, to nearly $25 billion in 1999, about 12 percent higher than a year earlier. Analysts said they did not know how the new De Beers policies would affect sales.</p>
        <p>''De Beers is selling off its stockpile in a controlled manner,'' Mr. Gassman said. Keeping the supply stable, he added, is part of the company's venture into ''market-efficient capitalism.''</p>
        <p>De Beers will also encourage the use of brand names. While few diamond makers claim name recognition today, Mr. Gassman estimates that in five years most diamonds will be branded.</p>
        <p>That arrangement should mean more profit for both diamond suppliers and jewelry retailers, Mr. Gassman said, because branded products usually carry higher margins. He pointed to Lazare Kaplan International of New York, which fetches premium prices for its Ideal Cuts diamonds that are laser-inscribed with the company's logo.</p>
        <p>''Brands will increase consumer confidence in the diamonds that they buy -- that they are the quality they are supposed to be,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Beryl Raff, chief executive of the Zale Corporation, which operates more than 1,300 jewelry stores, mainly under the names Zales, Gordon's and Bailey, Banks &amp; Biddle, said she expected De Beers and its dealers to pay more attention to consumer trends, ensuring that retailers get the stones they need for certain promotions or jewelry lines.</p>
        <p>''I think from a creativity standpoint, the consumer will win,'' she said.</p>
