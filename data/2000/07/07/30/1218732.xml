      <block class="full_text">
        <p>There was Governor Whitman, grinning broadly as she frisked a young black man while accompanying police officers here in 1996.</p>
        <p>Predictably, a photograph of the encounter touched off outrage from the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey and the Rev. Al Sharpton, who vowed to hold a protest here as the Republican National Convention geared up.</p>
        <p>More telling, however -- and what some say is a sad commentary on the state of civil rights in this city of 85,000 -- is how young black men insist they too have been subject to the same kind of random frisks.</p>
        <p>For them, frisking has become a part of  life. And even if they recognize the questionable constitutionality of being stopped and searched simply for being in the wrong place -- the neighborhood in which they grew up -- at the wrong time, their expectations of justice have been tamped down so low that they simply accept what others fortunate enough never to have been patted down themselves find unacceptable.</p>
        <p>''It happens so frequently that no one even talks about it,'' said Isaac Cole, 24, a temporary warehouse worker in the very neighborhood where the incident took place.</p>
        <p>What exactly happened has been well chronicled: While accompanying state troopers on patrol here one night in 1996, Governor Whitman was photographed frisking a black teenager who had already been searched for drugs. Mrs. Whitman has insisted that ''race was not a factor'' because ''he had already been identified as a suspect.''</p>
        <p>Yet the incident enraged Deborah Jacobs, executive director of the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, who said, ''It's a particularly egregious detail,'' referring to fact that the suspect, identified as Sherron Rolax, now 21, had already been searched. ''It's why I can go on TV with confidence and say it was an illegal search.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, crime is a very real problem in Camden, as it is in other cities in the state like Newark and Trenton. In defending the governor, some have pointed out that Mr. Rolax is now in a youth correctional facility after pleading guilty to subsequent, unrelated drug charges.</p>
        <p>It was a former Camden mayor, Arnold B. Webster, who invited the state police crackdown in 1996 that Mrs. Whitman was observing -- as she describes it, ''first-hand'' -- that night. Moreover, spokesmen for the state police and the state Attorney General's office have insisted that the crackdown was effective in reducing crime.</p>
        <p>For example, the total number of indictable offenses reported in Camden fell to 8,510 in 1998 -- the last year for which statistics were available -- from 12,244 in 1995, according to the State Police. Camden's nonviolent crimes, including drug offenses, had a similar drop to 6,405 from 9,016 during the same period, although the city is hardly unique in its decrease in crime.</p>
        <p>Still, Penny Venetis, assistant director of the constitutional litigation clinic at Rutgers Law School in Newark, said that overzealous law enforcement could be counterproductive. ''It's a feeling of alienation and a feeling of otherness, that the system does not work for them,'' Ms. Venetis said, and therefore they have little incentive to work within the system.</p>
        <p>For instance, LaWayne Jamison, 24, had the same reaction to the frisking as Mr. Cole. ''It's the usual,'' said Mr. Jamison. ''It's something you learn to live with. This is Camden.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Jamison had a cynical view of outsiders' outrage over the picture of the governor patting down Mr. Rolax, saying it was similar to the indignation over the recent videotaped beating of a carjacking suspect by 10 police officers in Philadelphia. ''It ain't new,'' said Mr. Jamison, who sorts hospital laundry. ''It just got videotaped, so they had to hear about it.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Jacobs insists that such random searches can come at a cost to society. ''One problem with people not standing up for their rights is that they lose them, and the then the police operate as if they don't have any obligation to civil liberties protections,'' said Ms. Jacobs.</p>
        <p>Then again, she added, ''For those who have bothered to challenge that kind of treatment, there are many hassles and few rewards.''</p>
        <p>In a Quinnipiac University poll made public last week, 78 percent of voters questioned said the photograph was a ''bad idea'' and 64 percent, including 88 percent of the black respondents, said racial profiling was a ''very serious'' or ''somewhat serious'' problem in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Despite the flare-up over the photograph -- which prompted some city officials to urge that the state not take over the municipal government as proposed recently by Mrs. Whitman because of years of corrupt and incompetent local administrations -- others made it a condition of their support that the state pledge to eliminate 200 illicit drug markets over three years.</p>
        <p>Among those willing to forgive and forget the incident is the Coalition of Minority Republicans, Democrats and Independents, a group of activists from Camden and Burlington counties that announced its formation last week. Members said heated attacks on Mrs. Whitman over the frisking incident by such outsiders as Mr. Sharpton could undermine efforts by leaders within the community to insure that the state's impending takeover of the city government benefits residents.</p>
        <p>''People are using it to create political theater and embarrass the governor, rather than to build a partnership with the administration,'' said the coalition's coordinator, Roy L. Jones, a former Camden City Republican chairman.</p>
        <p>It is a partnership that Robert Butler, a 69-year-old retired metal worker here, applauds. Mr. Butler, who has lived on Lansdowne Avenue for 21 years, said the corner of Lansdowne Avenue and Rose Street, where the pat-down occured, had been ''a million-dollar corner'' for drug dealers before the state police crackdown. ''Not anymore,'' he added. ''Everything's copacetic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Butler even engaged in a bit of profiling himself, suggesting that the city's young people bring trouble on themselves by their dress. ''Anytime that they have those black outfits on, something ain't right,'' he said. ''You don't wear what the drug dealers wear or you're targeting yourself.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Venetis, from the Rutgers law clinic, disagreed. She recalled a 1994 episode in Chicago in which residents of the Cabrini Green public housing complex, frustrated by rampant crime, invited the police to conduct random searches of apartments, a practice that in turn invited an A.C.L.U. lawsuit.</p>
        <p>''There has to be a balance,'' Ms. Venetis said. ''We are a creative species, and a society that can cure cancer and send people to the moon should figure out a way to fight crime and not violate the Constitution.''</p>
