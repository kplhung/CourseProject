        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>New Yorkers should be asking why so many of their fellow residents are leaving the city (news article, July 24). Immigration is not the only reason the foreign-born population has risen from 28 percent in 1990 to 40 percent today. There has also been an exodus of New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>The departure of residents from the metropolitan area is alarmingly huge. The Census Bureau's figures show a net loss between 1990 and 1999 of more than 1.4 million residents from domestic migration. Meanwhile, the net change from international migration was an increase of just under one million.</p>

        <p>The departure of residents from the metropolitan area is alarmingly huge. The Census Bureau's figures show a net loss between 1990 and 1999 of more than 1.4 million residents from domestic migration. Meanwhile, the net change from international migration was an increase of just under one million.</p>
        <p>Instead of nostalgia for the city's history as a portal for immigrants, New Yorkers should remember the exploitation of sweatshops, immigrant-related crime, public health issues and other social service challenges. City planners should be striving to cope with the problems that so much immigration brings -- and seeking ways to make the city attractive enough to stem the tide of departures.</p>
        <p>DAN STEIN  Washington, July 26, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.</p>
