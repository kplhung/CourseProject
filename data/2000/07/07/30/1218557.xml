        <p>DON'T MAKE ME STOP THIS CAR!</p>
        <p>Adventures in Fatherhood.</p>
        <p>By Al Roker.</p>
        <p>Scribner, $24.</p>
        <p>Al Roker, the meteorologist on the ''Today'' show, has two daughters. How he became a father is complicated. In ''Don't Make Me Stop This Car,'' Roker discusses the problems he and his wife, the ABC correspondent Deborah Roberts, had with infertility. He is honest and amusing about his low sperm count and his feelings of inadequacy about not being able to achieve fatherhood naturally. ''I'm used to failure,'' he writes. ''After all, I'm a weatherman.'' After a painful miscarriage and in vitro fertilization (described in graphic detail), Roberts delivered a healthy daughter, Leila. Roker, who is 46 years old, discusses his fears at being an older father; he is annoyed when someone mistakes him for Leila's grandfather. He recalls that 13 years ago he adopted his first daughter, Courtney, with his second wife, Alice Bell. When it comes to fatherhood, Roker had a great role model in Al Roker Sr., a devoted father of six: ''He showed us how to cook, how to clean, how to be good people.'' The most poignant section of the book describes the 7-year-old Al Jr.'s visits to his bus driver father's Damon Runyonesque Brooklyn depot. As in fatherhood books by Bill Cosby, Bob Greene and Paul Reiser, a well-known man with full-time help, rhapsodizing about the pleasures of feeding his child or changing diapers, seems a bit self-congratulatory. Still, it's easy to be won over by Roker's enthusiasm and self-deprecating sense of humor.</p>
