        <p>Though some planks in the Republican platform remain firm, there are some notable additions and, in some cases, a softening of tone. Here are excerpts and notes about what is new and what has stayed the same.</p>
        <p>ROBIN TONER</p>
        <p>On Abortion</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court's recent decision, prohibiting States from banning partial-birth abortions -- a procedure denounced by a committee of the American Medical Association and rightly branded as four-fifths infanticide -- shocks the conscience of the nation. As a country, we must keep our pledge to the first guarantee of the Declaration of Independence. This is why we say the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children. Our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that right against those who perform abortions. We oppose using public revenues for abortion and will not fund organizations which advocate it. We support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life. ...</p>

        <p>On Abortion</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court's recent decision, prohibiting States from banning partial-birth abortions -- a procedure denounced by a committee of the American Medical Association and rightly branded as four-fifths infanticide -- shocks the conscience of the nation.

We support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life. ...</p>
        <p>On Immigration</p>
        <p>Our country's ethnic diversity within a shared national culture is unique in all the world. ...</p>
        <p>Another sign of our unity is the role of English as our common language. It has enabled people from every corner of the world to come together to build this nation. For newcomers, it has always been the fastest route to the mainstream of American life. English empowers. That is why fluency in English must be the goal of bilingual education programs. We support the recognition of English as the nation's common language. At the same time, mastery of other languages is important for America's competitiveness in the world market. We advocate foreign language training in our schools and the fostering of respect for other languages and cultures throughout our society.</p>
        <p>Throughout much of the last century, the twin tyrannies of Communism and Nazism inadvertently gave an enormous treasure to the United States of America, the genius and talent and industry of those who found freedom on our shores. Our country still attracts the best and brightest to invent here, create wealth here, improve the quality of life here. As a nation of immigrants, we welcome all new Americans who have entered lawfully and are prepared to follow our laws and provide for themselves and their families. In their search for a better life, they strengthen our economy, enrich our culture and defend the nation in war and in peace. To ensure fairness for those wishing to reside in this country and to meet the manpower needs of our expanding economy, a total overhaul of the immigration system is sorely needed. ...</p>
        <p>On Education</p>
        <p>It's long past time to debate what works in education. The verdict is in, and our Republican governors provided the key testimony: strong parental involvement, excellent teachers, safe and orderly classrooms, high academic standards and a commitment to teaching the basics -- from an early start in phonics to mastery of computer technology. ... Federal programs that fail to support these fundamental principles are out of date -- and under a Republican president, will be out of time. ...</p>
        <p>We recognize that under the American constitutional system, education is a state, local and family responsibility, not a federal obligation. Since over 90 percent of public school funding is state and local, not federal, it is obvious that state and local governments must assume most of the responsibility to improve the schools, and the role of the federal government must be progressively limited as we return control to parents, teachers and local school boards. ...</p>
        <p>On Abortion  Recognizing the recent Supreme Court decision, this puts the party firmly on the record against partial-birth abortions.</p>
        <p>Beginning here, the text is verbatim from past platforms, reflecting Gov. George W. Bush's promise that he would leave the anti-abortion language intact.</p>
        <p>Supporters of abortion rights say this provision is particularly galling, since there has been no serious push in Congress for a constitutional amendment in many years.</p>
        <p>Abortion rights supporters consider this a judicial litmus test -- a promise to appoint judges who oppose abortion. Mr. Bush says he does not support a litmus test, but he did agree to preserving this platform plank.</p>
        <p>On Immigration  The provision on English is slightly softer. Four years ago, the platform called forthe official recognition of English as the nation's common language.The draft from party leaders deleted that; but it was reinserted by delegates, with a slight change -- it dropped the word official.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is trying hard to reach out to Hispanics and other immigrants, recognizing that the Republican Party has an anti-immigrant image among many voters. Over all, the passages on immigration are more welcoming and inclusive than in the platform from four years ago. There is no longer a provision that would have denied automatic citizenship to the children born to illegal immigrants.</p>
        <p>On Education  This section is Mr. Bush's attempt to claim the education issue, of growing importance to voters, particularly suburban mothers who are expected to be critical this fall. He is running hard on his education record in Texas.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, Republicans advocated the abolition of the Department of Education. That provision was dropped this year, reflecting the influence of Mr. Bush, but conservatives are still adamant about limiting the role of the federal government in education.</p>
