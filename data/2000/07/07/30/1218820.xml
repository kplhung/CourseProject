        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''U.S. Recommending Strict New Rules at Nursing Homes'' (front page, July 23):</p>
        <p>You report that a federal report on nursing homes found that ''substantial increases in staff may be required to ensure that homes do not endanger the safety or health of patients.'' When patients are in danger, the issue must be addressed. The fact that 68 percent of nursing home patients depend on Medicaid, which typically pays 20 to 30 percent less than private rates, means that nursing homes have less money available to pay caregivers.</p>

        <p>The United States must develop a policy to encourage more people to save for and contribute to their own elder care needs. All consumers would benefit if nursing homes could afford to raise staffing levels and increase the wages of front-line caregivers.</p>
