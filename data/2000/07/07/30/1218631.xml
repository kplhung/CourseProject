        <p>FREE ASSOCIATE ''Zabar's,'' and after ''smoked salmon'' you'll probably get ''West Side.'' But there's another Zabar in the business, and for the last decade Eli Zabar has been remolding the low-rise block of East 91st Street from First to York Avenue from a street of miscellaneous light industry into a sprawling upscale food village centered on his Vinegar Factory at 429 East 91st.</p>
        <p>In the mid-19th century, the East 90's near the East River had little of the development that was dotting the rest of the Upper East Side, perhaps because the large flatland north of 90th Street was a marshy swamp. Fill dumped from building operations gradually produced drier ground, and by the 1880's industries began locating in the area because of its nearby water access.</p>
        <p>The most prominent of the newcomers was the large stoneyard that the contractor Thomas Osborne built. It covered several lots, including the site where the Vinegar Factory now stands. Osborne, who built the big brownstone-faced apartment house at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue that bears his name, died in his stoneyard in 1892, seven years after he lost the Osborne apartment house in foreclosure.</p>
        <p>The oldest buildings now on the 400 block of East 91st Street date from that period, like the two factories at 403 and 407 built in the mid-1880's by another stone contractor, John J. Schillinger. He specialized in the new ''artificial stone,'' which was rapidly replacing traditional bluestone sidewalks, and put his monogram, J S, on 403 East 91st.</p>
        <p>Building records are contradictory for the gemlike brick and terra cotta building at 419 East 91st, but it appears that it was built in 1886 by the ironworkers James and Thomas Hunter as a combination residence and workshop, designed by the architect George Spitzer. The block also had a cigar factory, laundry and similar businesses.</p>
        <p>In 1909 Charles Roos built the copper works at 429 East 91st Street, designed by Kastner &amp; Dell. Across the street, the contractor and alderman James E. Gaffney built 434 and 440 East 91st in the early 1910's, at the time he owned the Boston Braves, now the Atlanta Braves.</p>
        <p>The most striking architecture on the block came in 1930, when Horace Ginsbern designed the Art Deco garage at 406 East 91st, with zigzag decoration in multicolored brick.</p>
        <p>Except for some big apartment buildings on York Avenue, the block had changed little when Eli Zabar arrived in the early 1990's. Mr. Zabar's father, Louis, founded the famous Zabar's at 80th and Broadway in the 1930's. After attending the Fieldston School and Hobart College, Eli Zabar tried business school and teaching. He decided, however, to follow in the family footsteps, but at some distance from his older brothers, Stanley and Saul, who run the West Side store with an unrelated partner.</p>
        <p>ELI ZABAR founded E.A.T., a combination of takeout delicatessen and prepared foods and eat-in cafe, at 1064 Madison Avenue, between 80th and 81st Streets, in 1973, and in 1991 he rented the lower floors of 403 East 91st Street to make bread for E.A.T. and other customers. In 1993, the year the popular Aquacenter athletic facility opened at 91st and York, Mr. Zabar bought the old copper works at 429 East 91st, which by then was a Baker's Brand mustard and vinegar factory.</p>
        <p>He and his architect, Richard Lewis, adapted the building to sell and serve food, keeping or reusing much of the original character -- like the giant hooks and lifts left over from the copper works -- and cutting old vinegar barrels in half for tables.</p>
        <p>''We try to find the story in things,'' he says, ''and here the story was very clear: a factory building, sort of rough, and we wanted to keep it rough.''</p>
        <p>Since then Mr. Zabar's food operations have come to dominate the block, from the aroma of bread to the sound of shovelfuls of ice sprinkled over produce to the occasional barricades of pallets of supplies. Now they include, moving from York Avenue west to First, a cafe and magazine store on the York Avenue corner; an old tinware factory at 430 East 91st, which he bought last year and is converting to a bakery; the original Vinegar Factory with its rooftop greenhouse at 429 East 91st Street; the adjacent garage building at 421 East 91st; the David Garage at 422 East 91st; a repair shop for his trucks at 420 East 91st; and his existing bakery operation at 403 East 91st. Mr. Zabar owns all the buildings except for the original bakery. He also operates a large store and restaurant at 80th Street and Third Avenue.</p>
        <p>Every day the restless Mr. Zabar zooms through his side-street empire, constantly tinkering, rearranging, improving. And it is a handyman's fantasy: the bakery, for instance, has a Piranesi-style complex of rolling belts carrying bread through, around and over the ovens; the Vinegar Factory has unusual touches such as giant wooden window hatches suspended from the ceiling with complicated pulley mechanisms.  There's nothing cutesy, nothing that looks restored. Architecturally it's more salvage than preservation, which fits into Mr. Zabar's innate sense of economy: ''Working with leftovers excites me,'' he says, referring to both food and nonfood items.</p>
        <p>IN 1998 Mr. Zabar added a tomato greenhouse on the roof of the Vinegar Factory and the adjacent building. It's a light, airy plastic shed. The tinkerer in him loves the fact that he uses the hot air from the pastry ovens below to moderate the temperature of the tomatoes on the roof.</p>
        <p>Across the street at 430 East 91st, Mr. Zabar's newest project is rooftop steel for another greenhouse, this one for lettuce.  Mr. Zabar can't give a bottom line account of whether the original $100,000 greenhouse has been a good investment: ''I don't really calculate costs,'' he says. ''If you do things right, it will work out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zabar has more than 200 employees chopping, kneading, broiling, icing, wrapping, checking, driving and everything else necessary to feed the stream of shoppers who make the block a destination. ''I don't think there were 26 people who walked down the block 10 years ago, and now we have 9,000 a week just go through the cash registers,'' in addition to the restaurant traffic, Mr. Zabar says.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zabar's operation spreads over about 38,000 square feet of mostly contiguous real estate.</p>
        <p>Has the idea of building instead of baking come up?</p>
        <p>''Periodically we look at it, but then we get confused and move on to something else'' says Mr. Lewis, the architect. ''Someday, maybe,'' says Mr. Zabar, drifting off and looking a little vacant. But then he snaps back to attention when he sees a problem on the sidewalk -- a parking stanchion out of alignment -- that needs fixing.</p>
