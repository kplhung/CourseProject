        <p>AN exhibition at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks that consists of art by inmates of Connecticut state prisons cannot help seeming a little wistful. An airport's business is flight and a prisoner's life is all about staying put. Fortunately there is the Prison Arts Program; it is run by a group called Community Partners in Action. As the organization's publicity says, artists and writers conduct workshops with the aim of ''assisting inmates in finding ways to use their prison sentences constructively.''</p>
        <p>Another goal is less tangible: ''the program works to reveal the complexities of our community, its institutions and its people.'' Putting prisoners' art in the middle of a bustling airport certainly fulfills the organization's second aim.</p>
        <p>At first glance the exhibition is unprepossessing; objects are arrayed in a seemingly informal way in four permanent display cases. There is no supplementary material, such as where a particular prisoner is or was incarcerated, or what the prisoner is in jail for. This is as it should be if someone's creative side is understood to be free while the body is incarcerated.</p>
        <p>The show's description, however, has a problem of semantics. It is said to be comprehensive while it is, more accurately, a sampling from each of five venues around the state that exhibited art corresponding to various themes.</p>
        <p>The Hygienic Gallery in New London showed ''handkerchief art'' and showcased the work of Lester Allen and Michael Iovieno, while ''memories'' is the theme of work shown at Trinity College and then at Real Art Ways.</p>
        <p>The show at the New Britain Public Library was art from various townspeople that a released prisoner collected after returning home to New Britain. They included tattoo artists and the man's former high school art teacher. Thirteen Gallery in Danbury showed a miscellany.</p>
        <p>One might expect the handkerchiefs to be the most poignant. An inmate might wave one to catch someone's attention or to declare ''I am still here.'' But the handkerchiefs largely disappoint; they are treated simply as white sheets of paper to receive any kind of imagery. ''Eye of the Heart,'' by Lester Allen, is a pretty graphic composite of a human eye and heart that looks like the familiar renderings of an extra-terrestrial.</p>
        <p>Anthony P. Seay takes his surface far into the realm of fantasy with ''The Light of Ra in the Caverns of Lost Souls,'' while Elijah Pink summons the ''Fighting Cock from Hell'' (the creature looks nothing like a chicken). From fearsomeness, Mr. Pink achieves cloying docility by replicating a flirtatious Minnie Mouse. But he gives a lesson in handkerchief art by using four squares to illustrate the technical steps in reaching his final image.</p>
        <p>Art dealing with memories is some of the most solid and the most moving work in the show. The artists under this rubric can write well, to complement their skillful picture-making. The memories in question go back to childhood. Kenie Scaplen is a meticulous illustrator. He draws a water pump that it is improbably equipped with a telephone. He describes the pump as a ''Swiss army knife of our imagination.'' He depicts the wider ambience; fireflies above the pump are heading toward a lake.</p>
        <p>Vincent Nardone's is another solid story. His drawing is of a toy airplane held out of a car window on the approach to New York City. Mr. Nardone remembers imagining that the drama of King Kong with its swarm of airplanes was a real event.</p>
        <p>In addition to the drawing and painting, the exhibition contains sculpture, many examples of which turn out to be the most accomplished pieces in the show.</p>
        <p>Viewers can sense a palpable difference between the two-  and three-dimensional work. A prisoner's environment doesn't offer much inspiration for drawing, although Mr. Iovieno succeeds by religiously making a pencil drawing a day. The drawings feature lively abstract shapes and when several drawings are exhibited together in the same frame they resemble the panels of a comic strip. But most often memory is resorted to for subject matter as well as rather bland lifting from comic books or tattoo designs.</p>
        <p>Sculpture, carving or assembling solid materials, is, on the other hand, a genuine experience in the present. There have long been stories of prisoners making soap carvings as a way of occupying themselves.</p>
        <p>John Tolhus has carved meticulous altars from bars of bath soap, and Paul Blackburn's untitled work from a large brick of laundry soap resembles the intricate carving on the facade of gothic cathedrals; one can make out dragons and gargoyles. Robert Garabedian has not only carved soap creatures -- including a sea turtle, a salamander, a ''red-eyed'' tree frog and a blue poison dart frog -- but has also vividly painted them. By twisting garbage bag ties together, Felix Rodriguez has realized a dragon, a boat and a car.</p>
        <p>But the most dramatic sculptures of all are the ''God's Houses,'' by Jesus Rios. Mr. Rios has assembled from cardboard three churches shaped like crosses. The decoration on them is fetchingly fanciful and includes cut-out hearts and many scalloped edges. He demonstrates a more earthbound pride by painting the flag of Puerto Rico on the side of one of them.</p>
        <p>The Prison Arts Program's ''Annual Show 2000'' is on the second floor of Terminal A at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks through Aug. 31.</p>
