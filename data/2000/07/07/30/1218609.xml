        <p>FLAGS on Main Street here proclaim ''Tony 2000.'' At the town's Utah Shakespearean Festival, not far from the majestic Bryce Canyon and Zion national parks, the organizers, actors and volunteers are still a bit dazed about having won the regional theater Tony Award last month.</p>
        <p>''We began in 1962 with just about nothing, a budget of $1,000 and lots of volunteers,'' said Fred C. Adams, 69, the buoyant founder and executive producer of the festival. ''This Tony Award was a validation of what we've been striving for over the last four decades.''</p>
        <p>It was also a validation of a resilient regional theater that was virtually unknown in New York until the Tonys but well known among a Shakespeare underground in the heartland. As many as 155,000 theatergoers, mostly young families and older people from the Midwest and Far West, surge into this sedate mountain town in the southwestern corner of Utah each summer for afternoons and evenings of professional theatrical productions.</p>
        <p>The fact that there is a substantial and, yes, adoring audience ''out there'' for Shakespeare as well as other dramatists -- not in New York or Chicago or Los Angeles but in Utah -- might surprise the Broadway and Off Broadway crowd.</p>
        <p>''This is destination theater,'' said Anthony DeFonte, who is performing three roles this summer, including Shylock in ''The Merchant of Venice,'' and has appeared in a number of television series. ''It's a place where people decide to take a vacation -- to see six plays in a few days and visit the national parks nearby. And they're a wonderfully attentive and responsive audience. They love the ritual of theater and we frequently get standing ovations. They are really moved by Shakespeare's work.''</p>
        <p>Another actor at the festival echoed Mr. DeFonte. ''Audiences gasp openly, they laugh openly, they applaud, there's deep silence,'' said Kathleen McCall, who is playing Portia to Mr. DeFonte's Shylock. ''And they are willing to be challenged,'' she added, seated on the theater's lawn in the pulsing heat before rehearsals.</p>
        <p>''It's daunting for me,'' Ms. McCall said, ''as for all of us, because they know their Shakespeare so well. Some will come with the plays, actually reading them as you perform. They'll look at you strangely if you say a wrong word. They really know the text. I'm sure at some point I'm going to have people from the audience saying 'the quality of mercy' speech with me.''</p>
        <p>Like some of the other 18 Equity actors who have the top roles this season, Ms. McCall has worked on Broadway, Off Broadway and in regional theaters. Auditions are held in January and February in major cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Some roles are cast with undergraduates; actor-interns are hired for nonspeaking parts and musical choruses.</p>
        <p>The mood at the festival, with its two theaters -- outdoor and indoor -- its behind-the-scenes tours, lectures and festivities on the lawns of Southern Utah University (part of the festival grounds are on the campus), seems ebullient -- almost innocent. The afternoon that Mr. Adams and other executives of the theater returned from New York after the Tony ceremony, the 350 members of the festival's company and 400 volunteers lined up around the theaters and passed the award from one person to another.</p>
        <p>''Those were the hands that made it possible,'' Mr. Adams said. ''It was a very moving hour.''</p>
        <p>As he spoke, nearly 200 people were sitting on the lawn at dusk, waiting to enter the 888-seat outdoor Adams Memorial Shakespearean Theater. It is modeled after the Globe Theater in which Shakespeare's plays were produced in London, and it is named after a major benefactor of the festival, Grace Adams Tanner (a distant cousin of Mr. Adams's), and her parents. The audience, which would see ''The Merry Wives of Windsor,'' was being entertained by ''The Greenshow,'' half a dozen dancers and singers in Renaissance costume.</p>
        <p>Watching them, Nancy Lindon, who grew up on Long Island, and her husband, Arthur, who retired in 1992 as director of public works for the Village of Old Westbury, N.Y., said they had been visiting the festival for three or four years and loved the plays -- at least most of them. The retired couple live in Pinehurst, N.C., but spend their summers in Park City, Utah, in the northern part of the state, the home of the Sundance Film Festival.</p>
        <p>''The caliber of acting is first-rate,'' Mr. Lindon said. ''We saw 'Peter Pan' today, and it was fantastic.''</p>
        <p>His wife nodded. ''We come here for two days and see four shows, and I love it. I'm from New York. I've seen a lot of theater. That's top-drawer theater. Well, so is this.''</p>
        <p>The Lindons voiced one qualification. ''The musicals -- sometimes,'' Mrs. Lindon said. ''Last year we saw 'Damn Yankees' and it was not good. Doing a musical is not easy. We did see 'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum' here. That was excellent.''</p>
        <p>Nearby, Heather Hill, an electronics teacher in Bountiful, Utah, and her husband, Warren, a dean at Weaver State University in Ogden, Utah, north of Salt Lake City, said they had been making the five-hour drive from Ogden to the festival for 10 years.</p>
        <p>''All kinds of people come here; you meet a lot of teachers and people interested in the theater and Shakespeare,'' said Mr. Hill, who with his wife used to live on the East Coast and in Detroit.</p>
        <p>THESE plays are utterly timeless,'' Mrs. Hill said. ''I remember going to Stratford, Ontario, to see 'Henry V.' It was during the Vietnam War. He made the speech to the soldiers going into battle and they were asking, 'What are we fighting for?' And I thought, 'My goodness, nothing has changed.' Last year we saw 'King Lear' here. The dynamics of the family is absolutely the same today as it was back then.''</p>
        <p>Because of the repertory schedule, a typical visitor can see all six productions in three days by choosing matinee and evening performances in both theaters. The roster this 39th season -- from June 26 to Sept. 2 -- is, in many ways, typical of the selections each year. In addition to ''The Merchant of Venice'' and ''The Merry Wives of Windsor,'' the third Shakespearean production is ''The War of the Roses'' (an adaptation of ''Henry VI: Parts 1, 2 and 3'' by Howard Jensen, a festival director).</p>
        <p>Shakespeare may dominate the calendar but other authors, of usually mainstream dramas, comedies and musicals, are equally popular. This year the festival is presenting Chekhov's ''Cherry Orchard,'' Michael Frayn's farce ''Noises Off'' and an adaptation of ''Peter Pan'' by Mr. Adams, who is also directing. A separate fall season, held indoors in the Randall L. Jones Theater, runs from Sept. 14 to Oct. 14. The productions there this season will be the musical revue ''Always . . . Patsy Cline'' and ''Driving Miss Daisy.''</p>
        <p>Because the festival takes place in a conservative state founded by Mormons, the selection of non-Shakespeare plays has stirred some delicate issues for the organizers, many of them Mormon themselves. Dramas, comedies or musicals with sex, blunt language or edgy themes can be unwelcome. In ''Noises Off'' this season, the festival received permission from Mr. Frayn to alter the line ''Oh, my God.'' Now it reads, ''Oh, my Lord.'' Tennessee Williams's ''Glass Menagerie'' was a big hit several years ago, as was Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman.'' But while ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' has been done, Tony Kushner's ''Angels in America'' (in which a main character is a gay Mormon) would very likely be avoided.</p>
        <p>A festival press representative put it this way: ''We don't restrict ourselves because of the content of plays but rather because of whether the audience would go. So we wouldn't do 'Angels in America' because we probably wouldn't get an audience to watch it.''</p>
        <p>Yet it would be inaccurate to label the festival tradition-bound and cloaked in the culture of conservatism. Ina Marlowe, the director of ''The Merchant of Venice'' this year and the managing director of the Organic Theater in Chicago, said: ''I didn't know any of these people when I came here and it's been an amazing experience. They have been totally open and welcoming to me as a woman director. I don't often get that in larger cities. I was not expecting it.''</p>
        <p>Kathleen F. Conlin, who staged ''The Cherry Orchard'' this summer and is the festival's casting director, put it another way: ''When you look at the history of Utah, right from the beginning the church was pro art, music and drama. Brigham Young said drama was the best way to teach moral values -- especially for those people who couldn't read. One of the first major buildings constructed in Salt Lake when the pioneers arrived was a theater.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Adams, the festival's founder, said that Shakespeare's dramas struck a chord for audiences in general: ''We haven't changed since Shakespeare's time. The same longings, the same cravings, the same desires.'' Mormons, he said, were especially stirred by Shakespeare: '' 'The Merchant of Venice' is one of the popular plays for Mormon audiences. They see the victim in Shylock. Having been victimized themselves in their own history, Mormons take great comfort in seeing this portrayal of humanity victimized by people who profess to be Christians.''</p>
        <p>By every account, the festival owes its birth and growth to Mr. Adams, a friendly and exuberant former actor with an obsession for theater. A Mormon, he grew up in central Utah, yearning to be an actor. After a stint in the Army he went to New York, where he worked in several Off Broadway shows and was a ''swing'' dancer, an understudy, in the 1953 Cole Porter musical ''Can-Can.'' By the late 1950's, though, he had moved back to Utah.</p>
        <p>''New York didn't need me and it was important to find a place that did,'' he said. He took a job in Cedar City at the small junior college that grew into the university. His task was to set up a drama department.</p>
        <p>''The community was going through a real letdown,'' he recalled. ''The iron mines had closed. The economy was shattered. At that point I said to the mayor and the city council that I wanted to start a Shakespeare festival. They thought I was crazy. The idea of Shakespeare didn't seem to impress any of them.''</p>
        <p>With the help of a local Lions Club, Mr. Adams began the festival in 1962 with ''Hamlet,''  ''The Merchant of Venice'' and ''The Taming of the Shrew.'' Students and local townspeople played the roles on a makeshift stage. Most of them made their own costumes. They also put on productions of ''On Borrowed Time'' by Paul Osborn and the Jule Styne musical ''Bells Are Ringing.'' The festival made a profit of $2,000 -- and Mr. Adams was home free.</p>
        <p>Today, the budget has climbed to more than $5 million, nearly 80 percent of it from the sale of tickets, which cost from $18 to $40. The rest of the money comes from foundation support and private donors, mostly in Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Phoenix. In 1989, the company opened its second space, the stylish Randall L. Jones Theater (named after the father of tourism in the region), at a cost of $5.5 million. And now there is a Web site: www.bard.org.</p>
        <p>The festival's appeal has started to lure travelers from the East Coast. ''I was dubious at first about Shakespeare in Utah -- and very reluctantly I went,'' said Kenneth Adelman, a director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency during the Reagan administration, who has taught Shakespeare courses at Georgetown and George Washington universities. ''And it blew me out of the water. This place is in the middle of nowhere. And what you get is extraordinary.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Adelman and his family began attending the festival a dozen years ago. This year, he and about 35 friends from New York, Chicago, Washington, Buffalo and other cities are attending.</p>
        <p>Certainly the Tony Award has given the festival a visibility it never had, and Mr. Adams said he expected audiences as well as fund-raising to surge.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, he still seemed almost overwhelmed by the award. At the festival's opening night this summer, Mr. Adams described walking along the red carpet to enter Radio City Music Hall to accept the Tony.</p>
        <p>For the man who didn't make it on Broadway nearly 50 years ago, it was an especially sweet triumph. ''At long last,'' he said. ''We've been recognized!''</p>
