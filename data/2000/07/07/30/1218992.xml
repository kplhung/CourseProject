        <p>Bruce Fleisher, who set one course record Friday, set another yesterday in the Lightpath Long Island Classic Senior PGA tournament in Jericho, N.Y. But he still found reason to be discouraged, albeit facetiously.</p>
        <p>''My record didn't even last 24 hours,'' Fleisher said of the nine-under-par 63 he shot Friday in the opening round. Fleisher feigned his disappointment yesterday when Jim Dent tied his mark at the Meadow Brook Club.</p>
        <p>The 51-year-old Fleisher had good reason to smile, however, after shooting a 66 for a three-stroke lead over Allen Doyle, who had a 64, going into today's final round. His 36-hole total of 15-under-par 129 broke the tournament record he had tied last year when he won this event; it also was the lowest 36-hole score on the Senior PGA Tour this year. Dana Quigley, who began the round a stroke back of Fleisher, is four strokes back after carding a 69.</p>
        <p>Quigley, 53, who won his first of four victories on the senior circuit here two years ago, actually led briefly. Playing with Fleisher, Quigley tied him at 10 under with a birdie at the first hole and went ahead by a stroke with another birdie at the par-5 third.</p>
        <p>But Quigley, though his round was bogey-free, managed only two more birdies. Meanwhile, Fleisher, the winner of seven tournaments and a record $2,515,705 in 1999, when he was both the rookie and the player of the year, caught up with Quigley when he sank a 15-foot birdie putt at the par-4 sixth hole and went ahead to stay with his second of six birdies at No. 8, where he hit a wedge to 4 feet.</p>
        <p>Quigley stayed a stroke behind until the par-3 15th, where Fleisher hit his 5-iron tee shot within 18 feet and made the putt. Fleisher, who was free of bogeys for the second day in a row, then widened his lead with birdies at the par-4 16th and the par-3 18th, where he missed a hole-in-one by about 8 inches.</p>
        <p>Fleisher's last three birdies were significant in light of a late charge by Doyle, 52, the winner of five Senior Tour events, who birdied five of the last six holes. Of Fleisher's dominance on the senior circuit, Doyle said: He's not invincible, but he's very tough. No one worries about me.</p>
        <p>JACK CAVANAUGH</p>
        <p>TRIPLETT HOLDS TWO-STROKE LEAD: Kirk Triplett played well in the first two rounds of the John Deere Classic in Silvis, Ill., then tied a record on the tournament's new course to surge from a fourth-place tie to the top of the leaderboard.</p>
        <p>Triplett had a nine-under-par 62, and finished the round 18-under at 195. Four of his seven birdies were made on hole Nos. 8-11.</p>
        <p>PAK AND REDMAN TAKE LEAD: Helen Alfredsson had three-putt bogeys on the final two holes, opening the door for Se Ri Pak and Michele Redman to share the lead through the second round of the Giant Eagle L.P.G.A. Classic in Howland, Ohio.</p>
        <p>Pak started the day tied for the lead with Alfredsson after both had seven-under-par 65's in the opening round. Pak's second-round 69 left her 10 under at 134.</p>
        <p>Redman shot a 68. She is seeking her second career victory and first in three years.</p>
        <p>Alfredsson led by a shot going to the 17th hole, but her putter failed her down the stretch, and she carded a 70 to trail by a stroke after 36 of 54 holes.</p>
        <p>BLAND EDGES AHEAD: South Africa's John Bland took a one-shot lead over Christy O'Connor Jr., who beat him to the title 12 months ago, after the third round of the Senior British Open in Newcastle, Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>Bland, 54, from Johannesburg, shot a par 71 for a three-round total of seven-under 206.</p>
        <p>The former United States Open champion Hubert Green, is in third at five-under 208.</p>
        <p>Japan's Seiji Ebihara, second in his last two starts on the European Seniors Tour, shares fourth place at 211 with Australia's Noel Ratcliffe and England's John Morgan.</p>
