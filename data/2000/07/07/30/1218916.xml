        <p>After Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene pulled up lame in last Sunday's Olympic trials 200-meter fiasco in Sacramento, Calif., Johnson blamed the news media for overblowing the showdown and creating a weird chemistry that polluted the event. He was right.</p>
        <p>Years ago, when the United States had great milers like Steve Scott and Sydney Maree going up against foreign stars like Eamonn Coghlan and John Walker, the mile was usually set up as the final, climactic event of a televised track meet. Meet promoters, track officials and TV executives felt the mile was the event to sell. The mile had glamour, charismatic personalities and the historical weight of the four-minute barrier.</p>
        <p>Problem was, television always promised records. Instead of focusing on the subtleties of competition and the significance of victory -- the essence of track -- telecasters blabbered for an hour about some record attempt. Invariably, there was a great letdown as the records rarely came. No matter who won, the public was left with the impression that the athletes failed. When track ultimately fell off the national radar screen, track fans suggested that the sport had lost its way and needed to refocus on competition, not records.</p>
        <p>For this Olympic year, the competition has been keener than ever: Marion Jones versus Inger Miller in the 200; Regina Jacobs versus Suzy Favor Hamilton in the 1,500; Adam Goucher and Bob Kennedy in the 5,000. Track and field had buzz again. The women's pole vault, led by the world record-holder, Stacy Dragila and, of course, the incomparable showing of Jones, seeking five gold medals in Sydney, Australia, sparked weekly excitement.</p>
        <p>The event with the greatest legs appeared to be the men's 200. Unfortunately, the news media drummed up the Johnson-Greene rivalry to the point where it harmed the sport -- and in a sour finish to a breathtaking Olympic trials, viewers were the losers. As The Sacramento Bee mocked it, the simultaneous injury was the ''hammy double whammy.''</p>
        <p>In reality, there was no rivalry. Johnson has dominated the 200, as well as the 400, for a decade, and you could make a case for him as the greatest athlete in the history of track and field. Greene is primarily a 100 man and is the world record-holder. When Johnson withdrew from last year's national 200 against Greene, Johnson rightly took some heat for claiming injury at the 11th hour.</p>
        <p>After that, NBC viewed a Johnson-Greene rematch as the event to sell for the Olympic trials. NBC set the schedule, slotting the 200 final as the closing event of the meet -- 5:48 p.m., Pacific time -- for its live, prime-time broadcast. Meet officials, seeking marquee value, went along. In Sydney, the last individual track event is the men's 5,000.</p>
        <p>Television not only set the schedule but also the agenda. In Sacramento, Johnson versus Greene would be big -- huge -- and reporters pounced on the story in a frenzy worthy of scandal. At a pretrials news conference, Johnson and Greene were trotted out together and questions focused on the athletes' supposed enmity, instigating the trash-talk that followed. Inger Miller sat between the two men like a referee at ''Wrestlemania.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, Johnson and Greene were not innocent victims. They could have merely said nothing. But the news media drove hard, and the athletes' pride prevented discretion. Reporters would tell Michael that Maurice said this; in turn, they would tell Maurice that Michael said that. It made great theater.</p>
        <p>Journalists spent the week looking for anyone to interview on the 200. They found the pliant Ato Boldon from Trinidad and Tobago, Greene's training partner, always one with a provocative line. They searched out the 1968 Olympic sprinter John Carlos, no stranger to controversy, for his thoughts. Trash-talk escalated from window dressing to a story unto itself. Johnson said everyone had something to gain but him. Right again.</p>
        <p>The men's 200 was reminiscent of the 1984 women's Olympic 3,000 in Los Angeles, another made-for-television creation that trumpeted a duel between the American star Mary Slaney and the barefoot teenager Zola Budd, a South African with dual citizenship who ran for Britain. Slaney was the far superior runner and a gold-medal threat. Budd was a promising youngster with little international experience. You know what happened: Slaney and Budd collided as victory went to Slaney's true opponent, Maricica Puica of Romania.</p>
        <p>After the men's 200 preliminary round on July 22, reporters swarmed around Johnson and I couldn't get close. I noticed another sprinter, Floyd Heard, standing by himself and went over to him. Heard, at 34 the oldest man in the event, had just run his fastest time in 11 years. In 1986, he had been ranked No. 1 in the world. After almost quitting track last year with an injury, Heard was giving it one last shot at the trials. He had a close friend advising him, a guy named Carl Lewis.</p>
        <p>Heard looked as if he could make the Olympic team, but no one seemed to care. When, in the 200 final, the overwhelming tension and 118-degree temperature played havoc with the two marquee protagonists' overworked leg muscles, Heard ran a close second to earn a ticket to Sydney. His performance was a lifetime best 19.88 seconds, a time faster than Greene had run to win the 1999 world title in Seville, Spain.</p>
        <p>Maybe it's good that the ballyhooed 200 blew up in everyone's face. Now there won't be another circus in Sydney. Johnson can run the 400, Greene the 100, and fans can root for a rejuvenated 34-year-old unknown in the 200.</p>
