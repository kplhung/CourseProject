        <p>Few government-supported lending institutions have had the kind of high-profile start that the Los Angeles Community Development Bank received from the Clinton Administration five years ago. Vice President Al Gore traveled to Los Angeles himself and, with top city officials at his side, heaped praise on the $435 million bank and its plan to create inner-city jobs by lending to local companies that commercial banks had overlooked.</p>
        <p>Now, as Democrats prepare to gather for their convention just a stone's throw from some of the city's most depressed neighborhoods, the bank is not just a disaster, but also an orphan. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, which financed the bank, has said that managing it is the city's job. But the city's development program, Genesis L.A., barely acknowledges that the bank exists. And city officials have said the bank is too mired in red tape to be effective.</p>
        <p>The bank's loan portfolio, meanwhile, is shot through with expensive defaults, and its management is mired in litigation with angry borrowers who contend that bank incompetence forced them out of business. One company, Summit Industries, has already won a $9.2 million judgment against the bank.</p>
        <p>The bank is looking more and more like an expensive, well-intentioned but misguided experiment in inner-city economic development from which there will be painful lessons. Bank officials are now focused on salvaging some vestige of earlier programs in an effort to stay alive.</p>
        <p>''It's been a true fiasco,'' said George Akers, whose failed company, Trinity Knitworks, was the bank's first borrower in 1996 and is now suing it, contending fraud.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Community Development Bank has made a total of $118 million in loans, all to businesses within what is called an empowerment zone, a 19-square-mile patchwork of economically depressed neighborhoods. A total of $36 million of those have gone bad so far, the largest for $24.1 million to a failed dairy project, exceeding the bank's own lending limits.</p>
        <p>Peter Taylor, chairman of the bank's board and an executive at Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street firm, said the bank had closed offices and slashed the size of its staff from 29 to 14. The bank is trying to reduce its debt to H.U.D. from roughly $100 million at the beginning of this year to about $20 million by year-end.</p>
        <p>''The old approach to spurring economic redevelopment in the inner city didn't work,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''There was way too much red tape and the board was overly politicized. So we're going to try a new approach. We're basically taking the year to restructure the management, restructure the board, restructure the staff.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''There were wildly unrealistic expectations when this opened. We're going to be more realistic.''</p>
        <p>Roberto Barragan, the president of the Valley Economic Development Center, another government-supported lender in the area, said the only way to salvage the bank is to turn it into a private institution, but that can happen only after all the outstanding suits are settled.</p>
        <p>''They have to stop what they were doing and operate in a completely different way,'' Mr. Barragan said. ''Their lending mechanism was doomed. They did a good job in their micro-lending, but the changes now may be too little, too late.''</p>
