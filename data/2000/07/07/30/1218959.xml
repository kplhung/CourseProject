        <p>Saxophonist David Demsey, music professor at William Paterson University, has been playing national anthem at start of minor league baseball games in New Jersey for past four years; photo (By the Way column) (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>As is traditional at a baseball game, major or minor league, before the first pitch is thrown, the crowd rises for the national anthem. But in some parks, the tradition ends there. It is not a celebrity (or local with a wavering tenor) singing. It is David Demsey, a professor of music at William Paterson University, who lives in Wayne, and he is playing the anthem on a saxophone. For the past four years, Mr. Demsey has been starting the games for the Trenton Thunder and the New Jersey Cardinals, as well as the Philadelphia Phillies and the minor league Scranton Wilkes-Barre Red Barons and the Staten Island Yankees. Mr. Demsey got the job when he was attending a game and was recognized by a minor league executive who also happened to be a fan of the saxophone. Although saxophone is not the usual instrument on which the national anthem is played, Mr. Demsey says that the crowd reaction is enthusiastic and that some players consider his performance good luck.</p>
