        <p>The Higgs boson is the last remaining undetected subatomic particle whose existence is predicted by standard model of particle physics, now that Fermi National Acceleraor Laboratory has recently reported detection of tau neutrino; researchers in US and Europe are now competing to be first to detect a Higgs boson, which together with Higgs field is believed responsible for the mass of objects; photo (M)</p>

        <p>IF asked what makes a bowling ball heavy, anyone who remembers a little high school physics might point to the tightly packed atoms in the ball's resin or the massive protons and neutrons inside the atoms.

        <p>IF asked what makes a bowling ball heavy, anyone who remembers a little high school physics might point to the tightly packed atoms in the ball's resin or the massive protons and neutrons inside the atoms. Resourceful as it is, that answer would not satisfy a real physicist, because it does not explain why the particles have mass in the first place.</p>
        <p>For most physicists, there is only one answer to the question of why matter weighs anything at all. It is called the Higgs boson, a peculiar particle that laboratories in Europe and the United States are racing to detect. It would be one of the most sublime discoveries in the long history of physics.</p>
        <p>After scientists at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, near Chicago, announced on July 21 that they had seen a ghostly particle called the tau neutrino, there remained only one undetected particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model of particle physics. Without that final, confirming piece of the puzzle, however the standard model could still be a castle built on clouds.</p>
        <p>The remaining particle is, of course, the Higgs.</p>
        <p>The Higgs should manifest itself both as a particle and as a sort of thick molasses of pure energy permeating space. The molasses, called the Higgs field, is normally undetectable except as the source of mass for all ordinary particles drifting through space, from the quarks that make up protons, neutrons, planets and bowling balls, to electrons and neutrinos.</p>
        <p>According to theory, violent collisions produced in particle accelerators should jostle the molasses enough to shake loose a detectable particle -- the Higgs boson. Capturing one would demonstrate that the molasses indeed filled space.</p>
        <p>A Higgs detection on American soil would also involve a certain amount of scientific crow-eating since, a decade ago, American scientists told Congress that the nation absolutely had to build a superconducting supercollider at a cost of about $10 billion, or forgo being at the cutting edge of particle physics. But since Congress canceled the project in 1993 amid cost overruns and charges of mismanagement, scientists' estimates of the Higgs' mass have fallen so much that far less powerful accelerators might be adequate to produce it.</p>
        <p>One of those accelerators is Fermilab's Tevatron, originally built in the early 1980's and recently upgraded at a cost of $260 million. In the bitter competition to build the superconducting supercollider, Fermilab lost out to Waxahachie, Tex., where the canceled project has left behind only a vast, oddly shaped tunnel.</p>
        <p>''It would be big revenge,'' said Dr. Franco Bedeschi, co-spokesman for an experimental team called the collider detector at Fermilab and a physicist at the National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Italy. Although Dr. Bedeschi spoke jokingly, the scars of the supercollider fiasco are still painful for particle physicists -- call it Higgs guilt.</p>
        <p>Peter Higgs, a British theorist, and others worked out the mathematics of the particle in the early 1960's. But it was Sheldon L. Glashow and Steven Weinberg, two physicists who had been classmates at the Bronx High School of Science, and Abdus Salam, a Pakistani theorist, who showed how the Higgs field could produce mass in a particle theory that described the complexities of matter in the real world. Glashow, Weinberg and Salaam received the Nobel Prize for their work in 1979.</p>
        <p>The theory is based on postulated symmetries of nature. Physicists use the word symmetry whenever they find that physical laws remain indifferent to some change. Physical laws are the same for particles moving to the left or to the right, for example. But some of the deepest symmetries occur in an abstract space where the properties of distinct particles -- say, an electron and a neutrino -- can be interchanged. The most symmetrical and natural state of this space, however, is one in which all particles have no mass, meaning weightlessness, meaning no bowling balls.</p>
        <p>The Higgs field allows particles to have various masses because it fills space like molasses, said Dr. Tiziano Camporesi, a physicist at the CERN particle physics laboratory in Geneva and the spokesman for a large experimental team there.</p>
        <p>The resistance it offers against particles moving through it amounts to inertia, ''and after all, inertia is the manifestation of mass,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The molasses is thought to have congealed in space as the universe cooled in the Big Bang, the giant explosion in which most scientists believe the universe was born, said Dr. Michael E. Peskin, a theorist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.</p>
        <p>Dr. Peskin, who warned that advanced theories that made all this less dependent on the caprice of one particle would predict the existence of even more particles, said the Higgs field could not be detected directly. But by producing ordinary massive particles in accelerators, he said, the molasses could be jostled enough so that it spawned a Higgs boson, which would decay in a tiny fraction of a second, making decay products that could be detected.</p>
        <p>So now the race is on between physicists at Fermilab and at CERN to be the first to find the Higgs boson. The two institutions make little attempt to conceal the stakes involved in the competition, which could lead to a Nobel Prize.</p>
        <p>''This would be like an adrenaline shot,'' Dr. Camporesi said. ''It would be the achievement of my life, clearly.''</p>
        <p>The first chance belongs to CERN's Large Electron-Positron collider, or LEP, which is approaching the end of its planned lifetime this fall. Scientists there have not seen the Higgs yet, but they are trying to decide whether to extend their run just a bit longer to keep hunting.</p>
        <p>With a higher energy than the LEP, Fermilab's upgraded Tevatron will have the next shot at the Higgs when it starts producing data next spring. After that, the much more powerful Large Hadron Collider should begin operation at CERN by 2005 or 2006.</p>
        <p>Physicists say all the signs point to a great discovery within the next few years. ''Having hunted for this weird beast for so long,'' Dr. Camporesi said, ''the day it is discovered I would really be very, very happy. And probably get drunk.''</p>
