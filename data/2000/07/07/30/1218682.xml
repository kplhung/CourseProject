        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To suggest that John Hejduk was not interested in building is to miss the central point of his life's work [''Solitary Performer on a Crowded Stage'' by Herbert Muschamp, July 16]. Those of us who were his friends and colleagues know all too well how frustrated John was about his not having built more in the United States. He had a deep desire to build, but he was unwilling to compromise the integrity of his designs and his philosophy to do what is called for in a world where, to quote the late Arthur Drexler, ''skyscrapers are machines for making money.'' He was very proud of his one executed project in New York, the Cooper Union Foundation Building, and of his other structures in Europe.</p>

        <p>To suggest that John Hejduk was not interested in building is to miss the central point of his life's work [''Solitary Performer on a Crowded Stage'' by Herbert Muschamp, July 16]. Those of us who were his friends and colleagues know all too well how frustrated John was about his not having built more in the United States. He had a deep desire to build, but he was unwilling to compromise the integrity of his designs and his philosophy to do what is called for in a world where, to quote the late Arthur Drexler, ''skyscrapers are machines for making money.'' He was very proud of his one executed project in New York, the Cooper Union Foundation Building, and of his other structures in Europe.</p>
        <p>John believed that architecture is first and foremost an art and, as such, that its ideas can be communicated in many forms. His respect and concern for built architecture is reflected in the Cooper Union philosophy, which stresses the craft of building and an overriding concern for exploring materials and details. This is one of the reasons that Cooper graduates are so eagerly sought after by the best architectural offices. Their talent, intelligence, and analytic and creative skills make them valued in all but the most pedestrian firms.</p>
        <p>John's high regard for building is also evident in the fact that, on his initiative, the School of Architecture was renamed to honor one of its most distinguished alumni, Irwin Chanin, the quintessential architect-builder of some of the best buildings in New York City.</p>

        <p>The writer is a professor of Architecture at the City College of New York.</p>
