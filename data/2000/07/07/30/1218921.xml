        <p>It was 3 p.m. one recent day at Columbia University, and seven graduate students, who ranged in age from 25 to 58, sat in a circle in Room 308 of McVicor Hall, home to the university's School of Social Work.</p>
        <p>The instructor, Judith Marks, read from the students' reports about their work with clients. But weeks of newspaper headlines, and the presence of a reporter, later provoked a discussion of social work and its rewards and perils.</p>
        <p>Tiffany F. Goldberg, a 25-year-old from Madison, Wis., had been struck on the back of the head with a chunk of concrete by a man on a Manhattan street in a seemingly random attack. Ms. Goldberg, who plans to attend Columbia's social work school this fall, had expressed concern for her assailant. She speculated that he had had a troubled childhood.</p>
        <p>The students, who were upset by the randomness of the attack, said they admired Ms. Goldberg's generosity of spirit. They said it was consistent with a social worker's outlook on violence -- to always try to understand its roots.</p>
        <p>''Society is into blaming individuals,'' said Kristen Miller, 27, one student. ''Violence is intergenerationally transmitted.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Miller, who grew up in Morristown, N.J., and works with mentally ill children in Newark, said she felt sad for Ms. Goldberg when when she heard about the attack. But she thought the incident might have been avoided if ''society provided the resources people need,'' she said. Specifically, she advocated more funding for treatment of the mentally ill.</p>
        <p>However awash New York City is in Wall Street bonuses and budget surpluses, venture capital and disposable income, it remains for some people one of the world's great social work laboratories -- full of poor, troubled people, children at risk and marriages coming apart. And its magnetic pull brings people here from all corners of the country.</p>
        <p>Christina Kucera, who recently completed the social work graduate program at Hunter College and is from Columbia, Mo., said, ''Moving to New York, I think I've compromised my safety, but I'm much more concerned for the safety of the people I've worked with.</p>
        <p>''I chose to move to New York because it has one of the largest social service networks in the country,'' she said. ''I also chose New York to practice because of the diversity of the people and the complexity of the sociopolitical climate. Under Giuliani, social services have been cut back. Nevertheless, I think even in these difficult times, New York City is an exciting place to study and practice social work.''</p>
        <p>Anne Condon, a 26-year-old student at Columbia's School of Social Work, said the attack on Ms. Goldberg had frightened her because it had been random. But Ms. Condon, who grew up in Pearl River, N.Y., said that she, like Ms. Goldberg, would probably look at the environment the assailant came from and the problems he faced had she been the victim. Social workers, she said, seek to find out why things happen.</p>
        <p>And that includes the causes of violence, especially after incidents like the attack on Ms. Goldberg or the stabbing death in 1999 of Amy Watkins, a student at the Hunter College Graduate School of Social Work who had come from Kansas. Ms. Watkins was slain near her apartment in Brooklyn. Her killer has never been caught.</p>
        <p>Gary Parker, 32, who graduated from Hunter's School of Social Work in May, came to New York from Methuen, Mass., 10 years ago. He decided to study social work so he could help change society.</p>
        <p>''I was struck by the continuing disparity of income -- how people were excluded from jobs, education, housing and opportunities in general,'' he said. ''The system is working against the poor as far as pulling them out of their economic hardship.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Parker, who knew Ms. Watkins, helped set up a scholarship in her name at Hunter. Like Ms. Goldberg, she had the kind of idealism that motivates most people in the social work field, he said.</p>
        <p>''Amy was a beautiful person with a vision of justice and social equity,'' he said. ''A lot of people would think she was overly compassionate.''</p>
