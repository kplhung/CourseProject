        <p>INSTEAD of being behind the bench, a state judge has spent mornings since July 10 preparing for a side career in front of the television camera.</p>
        <p>After court officials learned that Justice John P. DiBlasi of State Supreme Court here was taking mornings off to attend broadcasting classes without court approval, they temporarily canceled the cable television series that he had been preparing for.</p>
        <p>Last week, The Journal News reported that Justice DiBlasi, 44, was taking a six-week summer course weekday mornings at the Connecticut School of Broadcasting in Stratford, about 40 miles from his White Plains courtroom.</p>
        <p>Justice DiBlasi intended to become a moderator for a court-authorized television program on a local cable station, said Justice Francis A. Nicolai, administrative judge for the Ninth Judicial District, who added that he only learned that Justice DiBlasi was missing mornings when informed by The Journal News.</p>
        <p>''He made plans to be out of the courtroom for 32 consecutive days without notifying me in any way,'' Justice Nicolai said. ''He didn't even say he'd be out. I'd never have allowed him to take 32 days in a row.</p>
        <p>''If I knew he wasn't going to be in, I'd have made arrangements for the court reporter and courtroom staff to be elsewhere for those mornings.''</p>
        <p>Justice DiBlasi did not return calls requesting comment, but he told The Journal News that he was taking his vacation time in half-day increments and returning to court for afternoon sessions. He said he would now take evening classes. Justice DiBlasi has been a State Supreme Court justice since 1995, and before that he was a judge in the Mount Vernon city court system.</p>
        <p>Justice Nicolai said that Justice DiBlasi sent him a memo six months ago notifying him of his plans to start a half-hour weekly program to educate viewers on the legal system. As moderator, Justice DiBlasi would interview a different judge each week.</p>
        <p>The program, which was still in the planning stage, is on hold and  being re-evaluated, Judge Nicolai said.</p>
        <p>For the past year, Justice DiBlasi has been assigned to a special court for commercial litigation cases involving sums greater than $100,000.</p>
        <p>But after court officials learned of Justice DiBlasi's absences from court, they reassigned him to the central calendar part of the courts, where routine civil cases are heard.</p>
        <p>Justice Nicolai said that Justice DiBlasi had one of the heaviest caseloads of any civil judge in Westchester but was known to be highly efficient in moving cases to completion.</p>
        <p>Timothy M. Clark, the director of the Connecticut School of Broadcasting, said that Justice DiBlasi took the full curriculum of radio and television broadcast training offered to starting students, including voiceovers, speech, elementary acting, news delivery and news copy writing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark said that he and Justice DiBlasi discussed ''making videos for the court system'' and that the judge was hardly camera shy.</p>
        <p>''He was no aspiring television personality,'' Mr. Clark said, ''but he had a great voice and presence about him.''</p>
