        <p>FOR a city of only 65,000, Portland, Me., boasts more high-quality restaurants than most cities twice its size. Nourished by fishermen, farmers and ranchers in the region, local chefs have an enviable larder with which to work. And in summer, when gardens are burgeoning and there is a lobster in every pot, visitors can enjoy some splendid fare, and at very affordable prices.</p>
        <p>Symbolic of Portland's serious devotion to food is its three-year-old Public Market, a towering, blocklong bazaar where you can find everything from elderberry pie to elk osso buco. A 15-minute walk takes you to the Old Port, a compact grid of cobblestone streets and handsome old brick structures -- formerly industrial sites -- that have been converted to offices, shops and restaurants.</p>
        <p>Portland is an easygoing and casual city; I could count the number of jackets and ties I saw on one hand.</p>
        <p>Bakehouse Cafe</p>
        <p>A delightful perch for lunch on a summer afternoon is the Bakehouse Cafe, a homespun retail store and restaurant on busy Commercial Street, along the waterfront. The downstairs dining room, if you can call it that, is really an appendage of the bakery, where everything smells of yeast and baking bread. If it is a warm day, head up to the rooftop terrace overlooking the piers and the Casco Bay islands in the distance.</p>
        <p>Our party of four started with a round of locally brewed Allagash White Ale, a hoppy, medium-bodied brew reminiscent of a Belgian Ale ($3.50 a pint). The lunch menu features colorful salads and daily specials like a spicy Jamaican squash-and-sweet-potato soup, and a rich chowder with chunks of haddock and smoked salmon. Among entrees are a dense, meaty crab cake; a salmon burger garnished with chopped tomatoes and vinegar, and wonderfully fresh pan-fried haddock with a remoulade sauce. We just picked over the leaden crab-and-brie quiche and moved on to desserts.</p>
        <p>The sharp lemon shaker pie packs enough citrus to keep two whaling ships scurvy free.</p>
        <p>Street and Co.</p>
        <p>Also in the Old Port is a rustic, cacophonous place called Street and Co., where patrons get a sizzling preview of the menu by walking through the kitchen itself. Two low-beamed dining rooms have a country farmhouse feeling with lots of Mason jars, storage tins and dried flowers scattered about. The straightforward menu is conveniently divided into ''grilled or blackened,'' ''broiled'' and  ''over linguine.'' We started with a savory special of porcini-flavored flan and excellent grilled portobello mushrooms. The salmon tart was flavorful, too, but it was so cold we had to wait 10 minutes before tasting it.</p>
        <p>In Portland lobsters show up in the most unlikely places. At Street and Co. a grilled lobster is splayed atop a bowl of garlicky linguine -- not the easiest dish to navigate, but well worth it. A spicy blackened tuna was cooked precisely to order and served with tasty sauteed zucchini; sweet sauteed scallops came with a subtle anise-tinged Pernod and cream sauce.</p>
        <p>The wine selection, arranged by flavor characteristics, is heavy on whites. Prices are remarkably low -- ''The owner likes people to taste a lot of different wines,'' our waitress explained. We had a lovely white Aligote from Burgundy for $18.</p>
        <p>The dessert of choice was the custardy chocolate bread pudding with raspberries. Street &amp; Co. can get frenetic on weekends but the able staff handles it with aplomb.</p>
        <p>Back Bay Grill</p>
        <p>Twenty-three years ago Joel S. Freund graduated from law school and immediately decided that he didn't want to be a lawyer. After more than a decade working in and around the restaurant business, he bought the establishment where he was working as a waiter, called the Back Bay Grill. Today it is one of Portland's innovative restaurants. You will need a good map and an adventuresome spirit to find it (we were so hopelessly lost that, when we asked directions from paramedics in an EMT truck, they said it would be easier if we followed them there).</p>
        <p>Housed in an unprepossessing clapboard building, the Back Bay Grill is a cheerful little spot, all pale yellow with a colorful  mural depicting the restaurant and its patrons. The kitchen serves what might be called New New England fare, showcasing regional cheeses, baby lamb, free-range chicken and seafood. The homegrown, boyish-looking chef, Larry Matthews Jr., trained locally then spent a year at the celebrated Inn at Little Washington, in Virginia. Working out of an open kitchen that could  fit inside our paramedics' van, his crew turns out an impressively sophisticated, varied range of dishes.</p>
        <p>For starters there was a dazzling presentation of a shelled lobster claw that was molded skyward like a sculpture, mounted on a delicious potato pancake and accompanied by sauteed arugula. A local goat cheese, breaded and baked, was paired with sweet grilled fresh figs as a garnish to a Vidalia onion risotto. Nearly every restaurant in Portland serves some version of lobster chowder, and this one, plumped up with roasted corn kernels, is superb. It comes with see-through homemade potato chips. The Back Bay Grill has an extensive, wide-ranging, eclectic wine list and a good selection by the glass.</p>
        <p>Recommended main courses include a perfectly cooked halibut in a saffron sauce bolstered by chunks of chorizo, and a rosy salmon filet set over a sward of sauteed onions tinted with vanilla, along with a dollop of a radish lobster salad. For dessert try the winsome house specialty, white chocolate ice cream under a skein of chocolate spaghetti. Even when the Back Bay Grill is busy, which is always in the summer, Mr. Freund and his congenial staff make you feel relaxed and pampered.</p>
        <p>Fore Street</p>
        <p>A cavernous brick structure that once served as a munitions warehouse is home to Fore Street -- a big, brash, American grill built around a massive wood-burning brick oven. The open-kitchen theme is taken a step further here, as long farm tables extend into the dining area. Our waitress suggested one of the house special appetizers, roasted mussels, and they were superb. The mussels had been piled into an iron skillet along with a splash of white wine, garlic and chopped almonds, then roasted in the wood oven until they opened. Foie gras is grilled over apple wood until just slightly blackened outside and served with woody roasted wild mushrooms. Liver fans should try the pan-seared rabbit and duck livers in a heady bourbon-leek reduction.</p>
        <p>The servers are cheerful and well versed in the food and wine. The international wine selection list is limited but well chosen, and fairly priced. We went with the always reliable Trimbach pinot gris ($28).</p>
        <p>Almost every main course from the wood oven can be recommended, especially the monkfish with roasted wild mushrooms and ramps; the juicy grilled hanger steak; and a spit-roasted chicken with carrots, beets and sauteed potatoes. They really lay it on with desserts, a dozen or more by my count. Our favorites were the Maine blueberry and wild rhubarb crumble, and the warm peach tarte  Tatin with ginger ice cream.</p>
        <p>Gilbert's Chowder House</p>
        <p>On the water across from the imposing Customs House on Pearl Street is a great spot for lunch, Gilbert's, which serves the best chowders in town. It's an earthy, diner-shaped place with fish nets hanging from the ceiling, a lobster trap mounted over the kitchen door and, late in the morning, an assortment of weather-lashed lobstermen hunched over the counter. The fish chowder, as thick as a Maine fog, is loaded with haddock, shrimp, clams and lobster; clam chowder is equally good. If you are in a whimsical mood, they will serve it in a big hollowed-out round of country bread. The day I was at Gilbert's, the daily special was an  all-you-can-eat fish fry for $5.95;  a pound-and-a-quarter lobster was $16.95, with french fries and coleslaw.</p>
        <p>Gilbert's has a terrace right on the pier; so, too, does Boone's Restaurant (''On the waterfront since 1898!''), which serves a more expanded menu.</p>
        <p>Diamond's Edge Restaurant</p>
        <p>A summer must is a ferry ride to one of the Casco Bay Islands, only a few of which are inhabited year-round (buy tickets at Casco Bay Lines, Commercial and Franklin Streets). A 35-minute trip takes you to Diamond Cove, on the far side of Diamond Island, where you can have an oceanside lunch on the deck of the Diamond's Edge Restaurant. A sprawling lodge with its own beachfront, Diamond's Edge serves a simple lunch featuring a rich seafood chowder flavored with bacon, steamed clams and mussels, and a chunky quiche of lobster and cheddar cheese redolent of tarragon. It also prepares clam-and-lobster bakes to order. There is a moderately priced, familiar wine list; we opted for a sampling of local microbrews.</p>
        <p>The servers here are so caring that when an ocean breeze kicked up, the host ran off and fetched me a thick flannel shirt. The ferry back to the mainland runs approximately every two hours.</p>
        <p>In addition to its restaurants, Portland is a big-time beer town, with more than a half dozen microbreweries. Stone Coast, at 14 York Street, is one of the largest, with a rollicking pub literally over the brew tanks. For $5 you get a sampler of six beers, ranging from the light and tangy Sunsplash Golden Ale to the bitter India Pale Ale. Another sudsy hangout is Gritty McDuff's, in the Old Port at 396 Fore Street, with six types of home brews plus such seasonal beers as its faintly sweet Summer Wheat Ale ($3 a pint). Several other breweries also offer samplings.</p>
