        <p>After a half-dozen drafts, a proposal that the Child Development Center of the Hamptons become the second charter school on Long Island was unanimously approved this month by the State Board of Regents. The first approval went to the Children's Academy in Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>The Hamptons Center, which is to open Sept. 6, was founded in 1997 by Dawn Zimmerman, a resident of Amagansett whose 10-year-old son, Jon, is autistic. It serves 58 handicapped and non-handicapped children from birth to the age of 5. Specialists in occupational, speech and physical therapy augment the teaching staff.</p>

        <p>After a half-dozen drafts, a proposal that the Child Development Center of the Hamptons become the second charter school on Long Island was unanimously approved this month by the State Board of Regents. The first approval went to the Children's Academy in Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>The Hamptons Center, which is to open Sept. 6, was founded in 1997 by Dawn Zimmerman, a resident of Amagansett whose 10-year-old son, Jon, is autistic. It serves 58 handicapped and non-handicapped children from birth to the age of 5. Specialists in occupational, speech and physical therapy augment the teaching staff.</p>
        <p>''When you integrate students and they work and play and learn together, there is more empathy and a greater sense of community,'' Ms. Zimmerman said after the charter was approved. ''But there's no public school out here that integrates special-ed and regular-ed kids, and parents don't want their children on buses for over two hours a day.'' Currently, handicapped children are bused to BOCES programs in Westhampton.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zimmerman's first application for a charter school, which is publicly supported but has flexibility in designing its curriculum, was turned down last year because the Regents wanted a curriculum that would serve all children. After the proposal was redrafted six times, it was accepted to include children from kindergarten through fourth grade.</p>
