        <p>Just over a month after injuring his back, Lothar Matthaus returned to action. Matthaus, who was part of the MetroStars' six-man contingent at today's Major League Soccer All-Star Game, played the entire first half as a central defender for the East.</p>
        <p>Matthaus made several good defensive plays for the East in a 9-4 victory before 23,495 at Crew Stadium. He had no offensive contributions but none were necessary. Matthaus's MetroStars teammates Clint Mathis, Mark Chung and Adolfo Valencia scored for the East, which outscored the West by 6-0 in the second half. ''I'm very encouraged at what I saw today,'' Octavio Zambrano, coach of the MetroStars and the East today, said about Matthaus. ''I think his recovery is going well, and he should be able to enter our team on a regular basis.''</p>

        <p>Just over a month after injuring his back, Lothar Matthaus returned to action. Matthaus, who was part of the MetroStars' six-man contingent at today's Major League Soccer All-Star Game, played the entire first half as a central defender for the East.</p>
        <p>Matthaus made several good defensive plays for the East in a 9-4 victory before 23,495 at Crew Stadium. He had no offensive contributions but none were necessary. Matthaus's MetroStars teammates Clint Mathis, Mark Chung and Adolfo Valencia scored for the East, which outscored the West by 6-0 in the second half. ''I'm very encouraged at what I saw today,'' Octavio Zambrano, coach of the MetroStars and the East today, said about Matthaus. ''I think his recovery is going well, and he should be able to enter our team on a regular basis.''</p>
        <p>It was the first time Matthaus, 39, played in a game since June 28, when he landed on his back after a bicycle kick in his first game since returning to the MetroStars after playing for Germany in the European Championships. ''I feel good,'' he said, ''but I will need a couple of training sessions with the team before I can play a full game. I must be fit when I come back and I don't think I'm fit well enough now for the championship,'' he said, referring to playing in a league game.</p>
        <p>The league's leading goal scorer, Mamadou Diallo of Tampa Bay,  scored two goals, 73 seconds apart, and was voted the game's most valuable player. Jaime Moreno of D.C. United, Jay Heaps of the Miami Fusion, and Dante Washington and Brian McBride of the Columbus Crew  scored the other goals for the East.</p>
        <p>Ante Razov of the Chicago Fire led the West with two goals, and Mauricio Cienfuegos of the Los Angeles Galaxy and Peter Nowak of the Fire scored the other goals. Cobi Jones of the Galaxy assisted on all four goals  for the West.</p>
        <p>The goalkeepers were given little chance for any heroics because their  defenders were loosely marking the opposing forwards, who seemed to parade into the penalty area at will and take shots from all angles. The first goal came less than two minutes into the game and it was the work of three MetroStars. It started with an outlet pass by goalkeeper Mike Ammann to Chung on the left side. Chung spotted Mathis running into  space and played a long pass that Mathis converted from close range. Nowak's goal two minutes before halftime gave the West a 4-3 lead, but the East came out with more enthusiasm after intermission. Chung started the scoring in the 50th minute and Diallo scored in the 59th and 61st minutes.</p>
        <p>The home stadium for the Crew is the first in the country built specifically for soccer. Several teams in the league have plans to imitate it. Lamar Hunt, the sports entrepreneur and investor-operator of 2 of the league's 12 teams, the Crew and the Kansas City Wizards, invested  $28 million of his own money to build the stadium in 1999.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>Both starting goalies, MIKE AMMANN of the MetroStars for the East and TONY MEOLA of the Kansas City Wizards for the West, re-entered the game in the second half as forwards. Ammann wore the No. 19 jersey of his teammate DANIEL HERNANDEZ, who was selected as an All-Star reserve but tore ligaments in his right knee last week and is out for the season. . . . MIKE PETKE, the sixth MetroStars player in the game, had an assist. . . . Carlos Valderrama of the Tampa Bay Mutiny, the East captain, had four assists, all in the second half.</p>
