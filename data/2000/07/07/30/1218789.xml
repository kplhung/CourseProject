        <p>The Irish in New York City may be famous for many things, but merengue is not one of them. Yet Patrick Shannon, a newly established merengue singer, grew up blue-collar Irish in Flatbush, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>As a teenager, he listened to heavy metal, drank in local bars and got into fistfights.

        <p>The Irish in New York City may be famous for many things, but merengue is not one of them. Yet Patrick Shannon, a newly established merengue singer, grew up blue-collar Irish in Flatbush, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>As a teenager, he listened to heavy metal, drank in local bars and got into fistfights. He went to a high school where being Irish, Italian or African-American was what defined the students, and dreamed of being a cop. He worked as a construction worker, a milkman, a portable toilet delivery man. At 23 he joined the Marines and worked at a recruiting station in Bushwick, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Then, in 1994, while working as a cable installer, he became friendly with a group of Puerto Rican co-workers. ''For some reason I hit it off with the Latin guys,'' he recalled.</p>
        <p>Despite his reservations, they persuaded him to join them at a Latin club one night. He was pleasantly surprised. ''You could actually go out and dance with women and not get beat up,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The clubs became a regular feature in his life, and Mr. Shannon's love for merengue grew.</p>
        <p>''I immersed myself in Spanish,'' he said. ''I'd watch Spanish TV, listen to Spanish radio, 24 hours a day.  The only day I didn't listen to Spanish music was St. Paddy's Day.''</p>
        <p>A friend's uncle had a band called Onda Nueva that needed a singer. ''He reluctantly took me.''</p>
        <p>In May 1995, Patrick Shannon played his first Spanish concert, at a  Bronx wedding. Last November he signed a contract with a small Miami label, distributed by Universal. His single, ''Estase Enamorada,'' from his album, ''Patrick Shannon,'' recently reached No. 17 on the Billboard Latin charts. He opened for the Latin pop star Marc Anthony at the Hartford Civic Center.</p>
        <p>In 1995 Mr. Shannon met Nivia Marrero at a club in Brooklyn. They now live together in Queens with her two young sons and their 13-month-old daughter.</p>
        <p>His parents initially expressed skepticism about his career. ''My father used to call me Tito,'' he said.  ''Now they can dance merengue.''</p>
        <p>In June, Patrick Shannon and his 11-piece orchestra played at the Copacabana in Manhattan. ''It's a decent life,'' said Mr. Shannon, smiling in a black suit and shades, as the horn section warmed up.</p>
        <p>A cluster of women pressed  against the barricades and shouted his name.</p>
        <p>''When I get to the stage,'' he said, ''all I want to do for the 40, 45 minutes I get is make everybody forget that they have bills to pay and just have a good time.''</p>
