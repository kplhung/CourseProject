        <p>Tiger Woods looks as comfortable making history as he does holding a golf club. By winning the British Open last Sunday, he became the youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam, winning all four major championships by age 24. If Woods wins the P.G.A. Championship next month, he will become the first player since Hogan (1953) to win three consecutive majors. Stay tuned.</p>
