        <p>HERE'S an ad campaign I'd like to see right now: Everybody in Suits.</p>
        <p>Not khakis. Not guayabera shirts. Not capri-length cargo pants that might be useful for clam digging on Long Island Sound. But suits. With ties, please, and proper shoes that get a little uncomfortable after a long day at the office. As a guy who works at home and has skirted financial stability for years (a self-declared underwear writer who can go days without shaving), I don't think it's fair to have so many people so concerned with making money in such comfortable clothes. I mean, let's face it: if you're consumed by business, then you're a suit and you should look like one. This would not only improve the quality of civic life in what is now a nation of people in athletic gear and pajamas, but also make those of us who can't afford fancy mountain bikes, surf shacks and treks to the Himalayas feel a lot better for not being wealthy e-people.</p>

This would not only improve the quality of civic life in what is now a nation of people in athletic gear and pajamas, but also make those of us who can't afford fancy mountain bikes, surf shacks and treks to the Himalayas feel a lot better for not being wealthy e-people.</p>
        <p>A suit is the hair shirt I want every new-media mogul and mini-maverick to be wearing right now, in the heat of summer, when it's particularly unpleasant to be overdressed.</p>
        <p>Some have already seen the light and embraced the suit as a default uniform. But they have done so as a form of irony, not penance. Spike Jonze, the impossibly cool young director of ''Being John Malkovich,'' who could take lunches in a bathing suit at Spago if he felt like it, is a suit guy. So is the skateboarder-turned-art dealer Aaron Rose, of the Alleged gallery in New York, and when Keanu Reeves recently played a gig here with his rock band, Dogstar, it was in a dark suit by DKNY.</p>
        <p>Then there's Mike Mills, who has directed hip videos, including ones for Moby and Pulp, and ads for Nike and the Gap. ''I'm an old skater, and it became too predictable to dress like one,'' he told me, ''especially when everybody else has co-opted that look in such a specious way.'' The young Mr. Mills wears Brooks Brothers suits, which perplexes his peers, especially when he's out in the dusty hills scouting locations.</p>
        <p>''People expect a hip and edgy guy to be wearing stuff from Banana Republic, and it throws them off and puts me in a more powerful position,'' he said. ''It's the most punk thing I can do right now.'' The only time it makes Mr. Mills uncomfortable to be in a suit and tie is when he's in the presence of guys in suits and ties who are wearing them without irony. ''When I'm with an agent or lawyer, that's when it gets weird,'' he said, ''and I feel like ripping my suit off and relieving myself right there in his office.'' He sounds like a fun guy, even if he has a strangely contrived and convoluted logic about his suit-wearing.</p>
        <p>''It's a reference to Ralph Nader, who wears suits, but not in a dandy-ish way,'' he said. ''It's an anticorporate statement.'' Exactly how he reconciles anticorporate with directing Gap ads is anybody's guess. But never mind. This is a metaphysically modular moment, when you can be the philosophical embodiment of all kinds of things simultaneously, as long as you're young and thin enough.</p>
        <p>Omar Walker, for example, is the 29-year-old founder of BlackPlanet .com and an Internet analyst on CNBC. He wears conservative suits and has dreadlocks that cover his back. But unlike Mr. Mills, he is not dodgy about making the money and running with it, even if his parents are ex-hippies who still question the merits of a capitalist culture. ''A suit makes you seem more substantive, and that's a quality I want to convey,'' Mr. Walker said, ''even if I make everyone else in the office look bad.''</p>
        <p>Will these young players save the suit and bring it back from the brink of extinction? Will they inspire my friend Steven to take the Armani suits he threw into the trunk of his car (he doesn't have enough closet space) and hang them up properly again? Will these guys, whom I'll call the New Suits, help the newly casual Brooks Brothers find its way back to its former place of stodgy ruling-class authority? Will they cause a run on the inventory at the Salvation Army Thrift Store on Eighth Avenue, where David Tufts, a managing director at CIBC Oppenheimer, dropped off 20 fine suits not too long ago because he had no room or use for them anymore? Will my friend Stuart, an advertising executive with DDB Worldwide, regret cutting up his 200 ties?</p>
        <p>The fashion world, always ready to predict, pronounce and sell, sell, sell, is poised for the counterrevolution. Last month, USA Today reported that recent surveys are linking casual attire with casual work attitudes, and predicted that corporate dress codes are due for a spruce-up. There's even a campaign among retailers to push ''dress-up Thursdays.'' The August issue of Esquire makes a case for more casually tailored suits with a ''techno-modern'' construction that's cool enough for young Hollywood.</p>
        <p>And for women, suits are making a comeback this fall, too. Steven Brunnar, who sells at the downtown boutique Jeffrey, attributes this to the fact that suits are sexy clothes that don't demand anemic body sizes and that serve, like armor, to hide physical flaws. Katherine Betts, editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, on the other hand, attributes this reversal of fashion to the fact that strong women are now looking for clothes that reinforce their positions of power. Me? I'll attribute it, if it happens, to the same fashion cycle that has taken us from pegged to slouchy trousers in less than five years and is sure to push the denim that came in from the cold out the door in no time flat.</p>
        <p>But I'm not criticizing. And if you worry that being forced back into suits (where you belong) will squash your anti-establishment identity, why not take a cue from a wild and woolly friend of mine who left a commune years ago for a job on Wall Street? When an office colleague observed that they were wearing the same suit, he said, ''Yeah, but I bet you're wearing underwear.''</p>
