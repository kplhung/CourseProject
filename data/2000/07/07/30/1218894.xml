        <p>In the face of economic and environmental warning signs, state fishery authorities have taken the drastic step of declaring a vast 665-square-mile fishermen-free sanctuary through the heart of the lower Chesapeake Bay to provide safe passage for the millions of female blue crabs now on the southward trek to their high-salt spawning grounds.</p>
        <p>The marine police are on the prowl by boat and airplane to keep poachers from the female crabs that are the key to maintaining what has been the Chesapeake region's most lucrative fishery yield.

        <p>In the face of economic and environmental warning signs, state fishery authorities have taken the drastic step of declaring a vast 665-square-mile fishermen-free sanctuary through the heart of the lower Chesapeake Bay to provide safe passage for the millions of female blue crabs now on the southward trek to their high-salt spawning grounds.</p>
        <p>The marine police are on the prowl by boat and airplane to keep poachers from the female crabs that are the key to maintaining what has been the Chesapeake region's most lucrative fishery yield. The no-harvest sanctuary was ordered because authorities say there has been a one-third drop in productivity and, of even greater concern, a 70 percent drop in the number of females of spawning age.</p>
        <p>''This is rather alarming,'' said Jack G. Travelstead, director of fisheries for the Marine Resources Commission of Virginia. The commission oversees the region's major spawning grounds for the blue crab, which has long been one of the most fecund and resilient of bay creatures.</p>
        <p>But marine scientists, mindful of the Chesapeake's disastrous loss of its once vast oyster crop, say the female blue crab population has not suffered so much since it was devastated by Hurricane Agnes in 1972.</p>
        <p>''Our real concern is that if there's a natural disturbance on top of the current problems, we might teeter on the edge of the collapse of the blue crab,'' said Rom Lipcius, a professor at the College of William and Mary who is the crab expert for the state's Institute of Marine Science.</p>
        <p>The roughly 55-mile-long, 10-mile-wide sanctuary for the migrating females is intended to serve as a deep-water corridor off limits to the watermen now plying the bay and its tributaries for the succulent catch.</p>
        <p>''This is a pre-emptive strike against the increased numbers of crabbers in the bay and their shift to deeper and deeper waters in going after blue crab,'' said Professor Lipcius. He noted that a much smaller spawning-ground sanctuary had been maintained for decades but that something far more drastic proved necessary.</p>
        <p>A range of contributing factors to the blue crab problem is under study by scientists in Maryland and Virginia. They include overfishing by watermen setting more crab pots, the erosion of bay grasses vital for young crabs' survival and the prodigious revival of striped bass, croakers and the other natural predators that savor crabs as much as humans do.</p>
        <p>Even before the study is completed next year, fishing authorities decided last month that the threat to the bay's signature blue crab industry had grown serious enough to require an immediate declaration of the sanctuary. Crabbers were caught short as it was ordered to be in effect annually during the spawning season, from June 1 to Sept. 15. It covers the primary spawning corridor and grounds south from the Maryland border to the lower bay's mouth to the ocean.</p>
        <p>''There's a question of whether this is good or not,'' said Dale Taylor, president of the Virginia Watermen's Association, summarizing various complaints of his 100-member organization that their livelihood could be seriously affected. ''But I say let's try it and see what it does. We'd all like to build our stock up more,'' said Mr. Taylor, who worked for three decades as a marine patrol enforcement officer, then decided seven years ago to become a waterman and go after blue crab.</p>
        <p>Out on the bay, crabbers heading home after predawn trips seemed to have assorted complaints and suspicions about the skein of underlying problems as they questioned whether the sanctuary would work.</p>
        <p>''Time will tell,'' said Capt. Kenny Oliver of the Virginia Marine Patrol, cruising the bay and praising most watermen so far for respecting the sanctuary as a way to bolster the blue crab industry in the long run. The catch in recent years, says Professor Lipcius, has fallen off to about 60 million pounds of crab meat in Virginia and Maryland waters, as opposed to the 80 million to 100 million pounds taken in richer days in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>''Let's take a look here,'' Captain Oliver said, pulling alongside the Evie J and hopping aboard to check out the catch of Mike Mahoney, a waterman for 18 years who has the muscular arms and weathered face to prove it.</p>
        <p>''No problem for me,'' Mr. Mahoney said of the sanctuary, noting that he usually set his pots in shallower waters than the standard of 35 feet and deeper decreed for the sanctuary. He noted that some pregnant females could be legally kept if they were from shallower depths.</p>
        <p>Captain Oliver and his partner, Officer Paul Newman, who are part of the state's 65-member sanctuary patrol, decide in spot checks whether the complexities of the crabbing regulations are being violated.</p>
        <p>Captain Oliver intently studied the barrels of crabs Mr. Mahoney said he had caught outside the new sanctuary. He zeroed in on pregnant females, called sponge crabs because of the look of the bulky accretion on their undersides containing the millions of fertilized eggs they carry as they scuttle south to spawn. Outside the sanctuary, regulations say females with orange sponge can be kept; those further along to spawning, however, have dark-colored sponge and must be returned to the bay.</p>
        <p>Such regulations are studded with loopholes in the eyes of critics. They  complain that economic pressures have meant the government has shied from effectively controlling watermen and the number of crab pots they are permitted to set. Mr. Taylor, president of one of the dozen watermen's associations, said he was so tired of the disputes over precisely what was ailing the blue crab that he wanted to see an extended ban on the harvesting of all females anywhere in the bay as a loophole-free test.</p>
        <p>''Crabs go through good years and bad,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''But let's not take any females at all anywhere for three years and see how well that builds the stock,'' he said, upping the debate ante considerably.</p>
        <p>For now, however, state regulators will stick with the sweeping sanctuary as the most telling signal yet of their determination to protect the blue crab stock and ward off another catastrophe on the order of the demise of the bay's oyster fishery.</p>
        <p>''A lot of its effectiveness depends on peer pressure by the watermen themselves,'' said Mr. Travelstead, the state fisheries director. ''The public has to buy it, or otherwise it won't work. We can't put an officer on every crabbing boat out there.''</p>
