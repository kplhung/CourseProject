        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I hesitate to complain about a small phrase inside a compliment. But in my recent book, ''Home and Away,'' I never suggested that the allied ground assault of the Persian Gulf war was delayed ''so troops could watch the Giants and the Buffalo Bills in the 1991 Super Bowl'' (Baseball Books in Brief, July 2). The invasion took place about three weeks after the Super Bowl was played in late January. Was this alleged delay supposed to extend to baseball spring training? I do say in the book that I worried that Iraq might stage some sort of provocative assault during the game, as George Washington rowed across the Delaware on Christmas night to strike the Hessians. But the timing of the allied invasion of Iraq was dictated by supplies, troops, weather and the bombing campaign -- certainly not the Super Bowl.</p>
