        <p>Musical About Murder</p>
        <p>''The Screams of Kitty Genovese,'' a new musical with libretto by David Simpatico and music by Will Todd, will be performed as a work in progress at the 23rd National Music Theater Conference in Waterford. It will be presented in public readings on Thursday through Saturday and Aug. 9 through 12 at 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>The work is based on the March 13, 1964, stabbing murder of a young woman in Queens, while 38 neighbors did nothing to help her.</p>
        <p>The conference is held each year at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, 305 Great Neck Road, offering new works by new playwrights, lyricists and composers, performed by new actors, all of whom frequently become well-known on Broadway and in films. Eleven writers and composers were invited to participate this year.</p>
        <p>A second project titled ''The Highwayman,'' with book, music and lyrics by Kirsten Childs, was adapted from the Alfred Noyes poem as a ballad for five voices, and will be performed on Aug. 8 at 8 p.m. and Aug. 13 at 2 p.m.</p>
        <p>Songs, scenes and short musicals created in the conference laboratory by teams of writers, composers and actors will precede each performance of the two full-length works.</p>
        <p>Tickets for the readings are $12, tickets for a gala Aug. 13 brunch at 11:30 a.m. are $60. Call (860) 447-2135 for reservations, directions or more information. For tickets only, call (860) 443-1238.</p>
        <p>Lifting a Veil on Satchmo</p>
        <p>The world of Louis Armstrong will be revealed in intimate detail on Tuesday from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Neighborhood Music School in New Haven. Armstrong's Selmer balanced-action trumpet, made in Paris in 1934, is among the unusual memorabilia collected by Jack Bradley, a jazz historian and photographer of many jazz stars.</p>
        <p>His Armstrong collection, believed to be the largest and most detailed, contributed to his receiving two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts for his work as a jazz archivist.</p>
        <p>Among the items to be seen and heard on Tuesday are rare Armstrong recordings, tapes and transcriptions, film footage, sheet music and manuscripts, personal correspondence, awards and trophies earned by Armstrong over the years, posters and postage stamps.</p>
        <p>The school is at 100 Audubon Street and admission will be $10, or $5 for students and people over 64. For more information, call (203) 624-5189.</p>
        <p>'Moby-Dick' Marathon</p>
        <p>A limited number of intrepid ''Moby-Dick'' fans stay the course each year for the 24-hour reading of Melville's novel aboard the Charles W. Morgan at Mystic Seaport. The 15th annual marathon begins tomorrow at noon and continues until noon on Tuesday, when a great white birthday cake will be shared by those still in attendance.</p>
        <p>The reading aloud of all 135 chapters is done mostly by seaport staff members and volunteers, but visitors are welcome to take on a chapter or two and always do so. Copies of the book will be available.</p>
        <p>The Morgan is the last known wooden whaleship extant in the world, lending some historic weight to the proceedings taking place on its deck and in the forecastle, with chantey singers in costume adding a salty maritime flavor.</p>
        <p>Visitors who have not made overnight reservations must leave on Monday at 5 p.m. when the seaport closes, returning on Tuesday at 9 a.m. if they wish. To avoid paying a second admission charge, they must have their Monday tickets validated. There is no additional charge for staying on board overnight.</p>
        <p>Seaport admission is $16, $8 for children 6 through 12. It includes admission to all exhibits in the recreated 19th-century fishing village and shipyard, open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information or to make overnight Melville marathon reservations, call (860) 572-5356.</p>
        <p>South Norwalk Celebration</p>
        <p>The 24th Annual SoNo Arts Celebration will take place on Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to late evening along Washington Street and the surrounding streets of South Norwalk.</p>
        <p>What started out in 1980 as a local outdoor art show has mushroomed into an event that draws 80,000 people to the historic district overlooking the mouth of the Norwalk River.</p>
        <p>More than 200 artists and craftspeople will exhibit an almost infinite variety of work, and some 25  groups will provide continuous entertainment on five stages.</p>
        <p>Lots of food and drink, a children's art playground, a giant puppet parade and the annual Saturday morning Sculpture Race -- a feature that has become the centerpiece of the weekend -- round out the agenda.</p>
        <p>To reach Washington Street take Exit 14 or 15 from Interstate 95 and follow the signs to parking areas.</p>
        <p>A Holocaust Journey</p>
        <p>Yosefa Drescher, an Israeli photographer who lives in Connecticut, and her mother, Nitza Maier, an Israeli painter, took their spouses, children and siblings to Germany and Poland last year.</p>
        <p>The result is an exhibition called ''Overcoming 1938,'' one family's journey through the Holocaust and beyond.</p>
        <p>Interpreted in paintings, collages and photographs of sites in Europe and personal documentation, the two women produced a clarification of their family history, confronting its darkest days and celebrating its joys.</p>
        <p>The exhibition may be seen through Aug. 20 at the Greater Hartford Jewish Community Center, 335 Bloomfield Avenue in West Hartford. Viewing hours are Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Call (860) 236-4571 for more information.</p>
        <p>Dance in Brookfield</p>
        <p>Adam Battelstein, member of Pilobolus, dance teacher and award-winning choregrapher, will perform three dance works on Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Brookfield Playhouse on Route 25 in Brookfield.</p>
        <p>Rebecca Stenn, founder of the five-year-old Perks Dance Music Theater, will also perform in solo and duet works in the Pilobolus tradition of athleticism and lyrical precision.</p>
        <p>Tickets are $15, and may be reserved by calling (203) 775-0023.</p>
        <p>Food and Wine Festival</p>
        <p>A two-day international food and wine festival is scheduled at the Greenwich Hyatt Regency Hotel on Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Modeled after the annual Aspen Food and Wine event, daily admission of $75 will entitled ticket holders to numerous tastings of foods prepared by celebrity chefs, wines from around the world, and a series of seminars and panel discussions led by experts in the food and wine industries.</p>
        <p>Reservations and more information may be obtained by calling (203) 938-0591.</p>
