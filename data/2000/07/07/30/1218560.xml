        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>SUNNYVALE: The Rise and Fall of a Silicon Valley Family, by Jeff Goodell. (Villard, $24.95.) A memoir of a family's disintegration under the stresses of noncommunication, divorce and dumb decisions even while living in Sunnyvale, the ground zero of West Coast optimism.</p>
        <p>FREUD'S ''MEGALOMANIA,'' by Israel Rosenfield. (Norton, $21.95.) The author provides a fictional past and a fictional last book for Freud in this wonderfully ingenious novel that evokes Freud's ambition as well as his self-deception.</p>
        <p>THE NAME OF THE WORLD, by Denis Johnson. (HarperCollins, $22.) A sparely realized worldscape, from the Midwest to Iraq, zips by the hero of this novel, an academic who has lost wife and child in a road accident and whose job prospects aren't so hot either.</p>
        <p>THE RIVER KING, by Alice Hoffman. (Putnam, $23.95.) Hoffman's 14th novel concerns the death by drowning of Gus Pierce, a freshman at the haughty Haddan School, and the efforts of a Haddan police officer to solve what appears to be a murder, with the convenient assistance of the deceased's ghost.</p>
        <p>THE SOOTERKIN, by Tom Gilling. (Viking, $23.95.) A vigorous first novel, and a very nervy one; surely the first picaresque novel whose hero, Arthur Dyer, born in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) in 1821, is wet, slippery, covered with fur and otherwise indistinguishable from a baby seal. His mother loves him, but others intend to exploit his entertainment value; a chase results, accompanied by debates about human nature.</p>
        <p>THE CHIEF: The Life of William Randolph Hearst, by David Nasaw. (Houghton Mifflin, $35.) An absorbing, scholarly biography showing Hearst as a larger, more talented, more generous and less dangerous figure than looms (with the help of Orson Welles and ''Citizen Kane'') in legend.</p>
        <p>ROADS: Driving America's Great Highways, by Larry McMurtry. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $25.) This door sparingly opened on the private life of the author of 22 novels is an occasion for reminiscence and commentary on whatever pops up in the windows or in his mind as he crisscrosses the country: enigmatic glances at the Western past, salutes to hundreds of literary and historical figures.</p>
        <p>MILLIONAIRE: The Philanderer, Gambler, and Duelist Who Invented Modern Finance, by Janet Gleeson. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $24.) A life of John Law, the 18th-century playboy who showed Frenchmen that a piece of paper entitling its bearer to money was itself money, and who organized a speculative corporation that collapsed instead of settling the Mississippi Valley.</p>
        <p>THE SLEEP-OVER ARTIST, by Thomas Beller. (Norton, $23.95.) Not a novel so much as a set of interconnected short stories, this second collection by the author of ''Seduction Theory'' follows its hero, the narcissistic Alex Fader, from the age of 6, when he throws water on people from Upper West Side windows, to about 25, when he matures through exposure to pot, girls and grown-up complications.</p>
