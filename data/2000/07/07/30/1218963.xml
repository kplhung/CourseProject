        <p>One hundred eleven of pro football's 136 living Hall of Fame members strode onto the stage here, a place revered by the owners, coaches and athletes who play the game and by the fans who follow them.</p>
        <p>Sid Gillman entered in a wheelchair. Roger Staubach and Joe Namath glided across the stage to thunderous applause. Franco Harris and John Mackey and Chuck Noll and Bill Walsh and so many more champions were introduced. A throng of football heroes immersed in a pool of adoring onlookers.</p>
        <p>It was the Super Bowl of enshrinement ceremonies.</p>
        <p>There will never be another ceremony that features this many 20th century members.</p>
        <p>That drama and appreciation of history served as the backdrop for the induction of the Class of 2000. And matching the moment was a noble and glitzy class, one of the most complete and interesting since the first enshrinement in 1963. Joe Montana, Ronnie Lott, Dave Wilcox, Howie Long and Dan Rooney shared a common theme of thanks to family, friends and teammates who helped them reach the Hall. And their reception overflowed with interest and emotion from about 18,000 fans packed around the Hall, easily the largest crowd for an induction here.</p>
        <p>There were many moments that will be chronicled in pictures and in sound. Moments that will last inside the Hall of Fame -- along with a bronze bust of each -- forever. This group pushed the total in the Hall to 204.</p>
        <p>Wilcox, 57, was the first to be inducted today, and he spoke unselfishly about the friends he has gained in the National Football League and about his magical memories. Wilcox played linebacker for the San Francisco 49ers from 1964 through 1974, and he was presented by one of his coaches, Mike Giddings. Giddings said that Wilcox was ''the greatest edge linebacker ever'' and that he changed the position.</p>
        <p>''Football gave me a chance to meet people and to travel all over the world,'' Wilcox said.</p>
        <p>''People ask me if I played with Joe Montana with the 49ers, and I tell them I played before Joe and before money. I earned $12,500 a season. But the memories are wonderful. And now there are 204 people in this Hall and in the next 100 years, at that rate, there will be 904. That is still so few. This is so very special.''</p>
        <p>Long, a defensive end who played with the Raiders from 1981 to 1993, said that baseball is America's pastime but that football is ''America's passion.'' He was introduced by Earl Leggett, his former line coach.</p>
        <p>Leggett said that Long was the right pick for the right team at the right time for the Raiders. He said Long was the best leader he had ever been around. Long is one of only seven defensive ends to reach the Hall.</p>
        <p>''I'm proud that I played my entire career with the Raiders because that is something that rarely happens in today's game,'' the 40-year-old Long said, referring to current players who frequently move to other teams via free agency. ''I have always appreciated the history of this league. Now my sons have watched film of my career this week and they say: 'Wow, Dad, you were pretty good. You were pretty tough, too.' Their love means more to me than anything in the world.''</p>
        <p>So, too, said Long, does his 22-year marriage to his wife, Dianne, who, he said, has been his confidante, friend and counselor.</p>
        <p>Lott, 41, chose his father, Roy, to present him. Lott was a 49ers safety from 1981 to 1990 and then spent two seasons with the Raiders and two more with the Jets before retiring in 1994.</p>
        <p>He was a ferocious and feared hitter, but his father talked about his compassion and his love.</p>
        <p>''I have played with and among the very best,'' Lott said.</p>
        <p>And that includes him, emphatically.</p>
        <p>The same goes for Montana, 44, the 49ers quarterback from 1979 to 1992. Montana, who spent two years with the Kansas City Chiefs before his retirement in 1994, was presented by the former 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr., who said that Montana's legacy is ''much larger than life'' and who described how Montana ''turned losses into wins.''</p>
        <p>DeBartolo praised Montana's ''unmatched loyalty, excellence, courage and heroics,'' and said, ''They will live in our hearts and dreams forever.''</p>
        <p>Montana, offered humor, pulling out a long sheet that he said contained his speech. But Montana went on to speak emotionally about how he felt over the last six months, as if ''I'm in my grave and people are throwing dirt on my coffin and I'm trying to get out.''</p>
        <p>The glowing praise and retrospect on his career made him uncomfortable. ''I feel like I didn't understand what this was all about until I got here this weekend and saw all of these guys and realized I was on a new team,'' Montana said. ''This is not the ending point but the beginning of my career and life with a new team.''</p>
        <p>Rooney, the Pittsburgh Steelers owner, was presented by the Hall of Famer Joe Greene, a former Steeler. Rooney has spent the last 45 years with the Steelers. Now he and the rest of the Class of 2000 will be recognized forever in the Hall.</p>
        <p>''There are so many to thank,'' Rooney said. ''I thank them all.''</p>
