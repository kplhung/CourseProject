        <p>It was 1995 and Giants Coach Dan Reeves informed the front office he wanted to bring the free-agent quarterback Tommy Maddox to New York. When several team scouts heard the news, they rolled their eyes. They had viewed Maddox on film and thought he had a weak arm, played nervous and had bad aim. Other than that, he was fine.</p>
        <p>But Reeves insisted. As coach and general manager of the Denver Broncos, he had drafted Maddox with a No. 1 pick, and even though Maddox was a disaster there, Reeves still wanted to give the player another chance. Maddox got it. On Oct. 15 of that year, against Philadelphia, Maddox went 6 of 23 for 49 yards and 3 interceptions. His passer rating for the game was zero.</p>

        <p>It was 1995 and Giants Coach Dan Reeves informed the front office he wanted to bring the free-agent quarterback Tommy Maddox to New York. When several team scouts heard the news, they rolled their eyes. They had viewed Maddox on film and thought he had a weak arm, played nervous and had bad aim. Other than that, he was fine.</p>
        <p>But Reeves insisted. As coach and general manager of the Denver Broncos, he had drafted Maddox with a No. 1 pick, and even though Maddox was a disaster there, Reeves still wanted to give the player another chance. Maddox got it. On Oct. 15 of that year, against Philadelphia, Maddox went 6 of 23 for 49 yards and 3 interceptions. His passer rating for the game was zero.</p>
        <p>Experiment over. Maddox was gone soon after that horrid afternoon and is now out of the league, but Reeves's stubbornness about Maddox started a rift between the coaching staff and the front office.</p>
        <p>Reeves was fired as the Giants' coach, with the main issue being control over personnel decisions like picking the players in the draft. Now, as head coach and general manager of the Falcons, Reeves has taken the once joke of a franchise to new heights, a Super Bowl berth. His coaching ability was the main reason the Falcons upset the Minnesota Vikings in the National Conference title game two years ago.</p>
        <p>But Reeves has also continued to demonstrate that he is one of the worst talent evaluators in football. Except now there are no checks and balances as there were with the Giants. He makes the picks and there is no one in the Falcons organization willing to challenge him. Thus, considering the questionable nature of Reeves's recent selections, it is not an overstatement to say that the franchise could soon take several large steps back.</p>
        <p>That is already beginning to happen. Atlanta is only two years removed from the Super Bowl, and St. Louis has passed the Falcons in the division, as most likely has Carolina. Both teams added depth and speed with smart drafts.</p>
        <p>What some coaches do not seem to understand is that coaching and evaluating talent are two different animals. Personnel men and scouts log tens of thousands of miles going to college games and watch more film than a movie critic. There is no such thing as a part-time scout, just like there is no such thing as a part-time coach.</p>
        <p>The examples of good coach/ bad talent scout are everywhere: Mike Ditka, the former New Orleans Saints coach, traded his entire draft for running back Ricky Williams, which may end up being one of the biggest draft blunders of the last 15 years. That move helped get Ditka fired, yet he had been a good enough coach to have led the Chicago Bears to the Super Bowl XX championship in 1985.</p>
        <p>Of the 1997, 1998 and 1999 drafts under Bill Parcells as general manager of the Jets, he selected 22 players total, but only 8 have started with the team, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. None of his draft picks have made the Pro Bowl. Parcells was recently named coach of the decade.</p>
        <p>So, great coach plus mediocre talent evaluator does not always add up to a great draft.</p>
        <p>Reeves is one of only three coaches in league history to take three different teams to the playoffs (Parcells and Chuck Knox are the others). His coaching job with Atlanta the season of Super Bowl XXXIII was among the best of the last decade.</p>
        <p>But Reeves has done a poor job of replenishing talent, to the point where it is conceivable that a few years from now, when aging stars like running back Jamal Anderson and quarterback Chris Chandler move on, there will be mediocre talent, or less, waiting to replace them.</p>
        <p>The 1997 draft, Reeves's first for the Falcons, stands as a symbol for his troubles in picking players. He traded down eight spots in the first round to take Nebraska cornerback Michael Booker, passing a better player at the position in Shawn Springs, and also passing tight end Tony Gonzalez, now one of the league's best.</p>
        <p>Last week, Booker, after several years of struggling, bolted training camp without an excuse (he hung out at a local waffle house) and questioned whether he wanted to play football. Booker has returned to camp, but his future is cloudy.</p>
        <p>Of the nine players from that draft, three at one point or another left the team. Quarterback Tony Graziani was also in that class, and he has been a total bust.</p>
        <p>The recent picks of Reeves have not been much better. His first-round pick in 1998 was Keith Brooking out of Georgia Tech, in 1999 it was Patrick Kerney out of Virginia. Also in that draft, Reeves traded his 2000 No. 1 pick to Baltimore so he could draft Mississippi State tight end Reggie Kelly, despite the fact few teams had Kelly rated as a first-rounder and the Falcons had a surplus of tight ends.</p>
        <p>Maybe those players will turn out to be Pro Bowlers, but so far, none has shown much potential. In other words, the cupboard is running bare.</p>
        <p>Ethics Question on Pickens</p>
        <p>The bizarre trip of wide receiver Carl Pickens ended last week when he signed a multiyear, incentive-laden contract with the Tennessee Titans. Both Pickens and his old team, the Cincinnati Bengals, were happy he was gone.</p>
        <p>Late during the negotiations, Pickens dumped his second agent and was being advised by a third, Marvin Demoff, who is also the agent for Titans Coach Jeff Fisher.</p>
        <p>Teams that were interested in Pickens last week questioned the ethics of that situation. But there have been a number of instances when an agent represented both a player and the head coach on the same team.</p>
        <p>The team officials complaining about the arrangement are simply upset that they lost out on acquiring the wide receiver.</p>
        <p>Scouts Can See Redskins</p>
        <p>The Washington Redskins' decision to charge $10 for admission to training-camp practices has scouts from competing teams taking advantage of a little-known league rule. It states that if a team charges admission to practices, then scouts from competing teams, normally prohibited from attending, can go.</p>
        <p>So scouts from about a dozen teams have paid their 10 bucks and watched the Redskins go through their summer drills, several said last week. Teams do not gain a huge tactical advantage by doing this because teams rarely work on secrets in such a public setting. But it does give scouts the chance to get an early start on looking at the Redskins' personnel.</p>
        <p>Around the League</p>
        <p>The Panthers' potential defensive line: Eric Swann and Sean Gilbert at tackle and Reggie White and Chuck Smith at defensive end. That could be, if their conditioning holds out, a formidable foursome. . . . Eric Moulds, the excellent Buffalo wide receiver, is having his best camp ever, a scary thought for the rest of the division. . . . The Redskins will use cornerback Deion Sanders and Champ Bailey together in a few of there special-teams situations. . . . Look for Oakland cornerback Charles Woodson to be involved in the offense this season. . . . New England Coach Bill Belichick on wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who was traded from the Jets to Tampa Bay: ''I have a lot of regard for him. I'm glad he is out of our division. When we first met, he straightened out some misconceptions I had about him, and I straightened out some misconceptions he had about me. We had a good working relationship.''</p>
