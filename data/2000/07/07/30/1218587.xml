        <p>This has been the Whitney century at Saratoga Springs.</p>
        <p>In 1900, William C. Whitney, who made millions in New York City street railways, took over Saratoga Race Course, expanded it and reinvigorated the whole town. Soon his cronies, notably Reggie Vanderbilt and John Bet-a-Million Gates, were dropping hundreds of thousands of dollars at Richard A. Canfield's casino, and Victor Herbert and John Philip Sousa were playing the Springs.</p>
        <p>In 2000, Whitney's Victorian grandstand is still the town's symbol, and the racing season is by far the best in the country. The high-rollers' ghosts pad about the Casino museum. The New York City Ballet, the Philadelphia Orchestra and Britney Spears, among others, play the Performing Arts Center. And most  amazing, although she has lowered her public profile a bit, a Whitney towers over the resort.</p>
        <p>Marylou Whitney's wealth has been a royal force in preserving Saratoga, and when she arrives for the  Whitney Gala on Friday at the Casino in Congress Park, it will launch the season in earnest.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>A who's who of thoroughbreds and jockeys stars at Saratoga Race Course, America's oldest major sports venue. The 36-day program was scheduled to open on Wednesday  and runs through Labor Day. After attracting 900,000-plus fans last season, a record, the New York Racing Association has poured more millions into this year's purses, bringing them to $8.7 million, another record.  The $1 million Travers Stakes on Aug. 26 is the highlight of the season.  The $750,000 Whitney Handicap will be run next Sunday and the $750,000 Alabama Stakes on Aug. 19.</p>
        <p>The original track, now in a stable area across Union Avenue, dates from 1847 and today's main course from 1864. The races start at 1 p.m. every day except Tuesday, when the track is closed, and Aug. 26, when the first post time is 12:30 p.m. General admission, $2; $4 for the clubhouse (no short-shorts, cut-offs, tank tops).</p>
        <p>Breakfast at the track from 7 to 9:30 a.m. allows you to see workouts, the barn area, a paddock show and a starting-gate demonstration. No reservations are required (first come  first served), though the lines are often long on nice days. Information:  (518) 584-6200.</p>
        <p>The resort's other great show is at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center on Route 50 just outside town. It seats 5,000 in the amphitheater, with room for 20,000 more on the lawn.  Among the stars: Moody Blues (Sunday), Motley Crue with Megadeth and Anthrax (Aug. 7), the Boys Choir of Harlem (Aug. 8), Lord of the Dance (Aug. 13), Counting Crows and Live with Galactic (Aug. 14),  Pearl Jam (Aug. 27), the Dave Matthews Band (Aug. 29) and Britney Spears (Aug. 30). Ticket prices for special events range from $8 on the lawn for the Boys Choir of Harlem to $48 for the best seats in the amphitheater for Counting Crows and Live with Galactic. For information, call (518) 587-3330.</p>
        <p>On the heels of the New York City Ballet, which wound up its summer camp here on July 22, the Philadelphia Orchestra, Charles Dutoit conducting, opens its own summer season at SPAC on Wednesday, with the pianist Andre Watts. Other guest performers: the violinists Chantal Juillet (Saturday), Sarah Chang (Aug. 10) and Vadim Repin (Aug. 11), the pianists Emanuel Ax (Friday), Jon Kimura Parker (Aug. 9), Jean-Yves Thibaudet (Aug. 12) and Stephen Hough (Aug. 19) and the conductor and violinist Itzhak Perlman (Aug. 17); ''Porgy and Bess'' will be performed Aug. 18. Tickets  range from $13 on the lawn to $50 for boxes. A lawn pass will get you into all orchestra performances for $100.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>In the spectacular new wing of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, at 191 Union Avenue (www.racingmuseum.org), you can see saddles used by Julie Krone and Bill Shoemaker, the Triple Crown trophies won by Whirlaway, the gold-plated diamond-encrusted whip presented to the jockey Jerry Bailey for Cigar's victory in the Dubai World Cup in 1996, and the whip Ron Turcotte did not have to use as Secretariat passed the eighth pole on the way to his unforgettable 1973 Belmont Stakes triumph (the pole itself is on the front lawn). It's all in the new Hall of Fame Heroes room, part of an $8 million renovation.</p>
        <p>The exhibits are by turns memory-jogging (the silks Steve Cauthen wore in navigating Affirmed to his narrow triumphs over Alydar), delightful (the mail sent to Kelso) and  really odd (a photograph of a crowd staring at Man o' War's corpse). The museum is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily through the racing season, then 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday and noon to 4:30 p.m. Sunday. Admission is $7; (518) 584-0400.</p>
        <p>Visitors can design their own sightseeing strolls past Saratoga's lovely old homes (for a guide, you can stop by the Urban Heritage Area visitor center across from Congress Park on Broadway or the Chamber of Commerce booth in front of the park). One of the most eye-opening would take in Greek revival homes from the 1820's onward. Walk from Broadway up Division Street for three blocks to find five examples: Nos. 1, 3 and 4 Franklin Square and Nos. 59 and 63 Franklin Street. Another walk would introduce you to Congress Park and its circa-1900 Florentine marble Tritons in a pool.  Vandalized last year, they are now repaired and furiously blowing water at each other again.</p>
        <p>Or you can drive past the racecourse on Union Avenue and through the entrance to the wooded Yaddo artists retreat, now celebrating its centennial, and walk through classical Italian rose and Anglo-American rock gardens, graced with pools and century-old statuary. Guided garden tours at 11 a.m. Tuesdays (until Labor Day), Saturdays and Sundays are $2; (518) 584-0746.</p>
        <p>Early birds can catch one of Saratoga's loveliest sights, the thoroughbreds working out in the morning mist (from 5:30 to 10:30) at the Oklahoma training track. The public is not allowed through the gate but you can still get a nice view through the fence along East Avenue, between Fifth and Union avenues. (The National Museum of Racing offers  tours that take groups inside the gate  during training; $10, which includes museum admission.)</p>
        <p>The Adelphi Hotel, 365 Broadway, is a downtown landmark, its luscious antique lobby a good place to stop for a drink. Cross the street for a view of the hotel's glorious raised piazza, with pierced spandrel openings, thin three-story columns, high Victorian windows, and Renaissance and Italianate motifs. It's from 1877, when they got the most out of a stoop.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>Hotel reservations can be hard to come by through Labor Day, especially on weekends.</p>
        <p>Now into its first full racing season, the 112-room Hilton Garden Inn,  125 South Broadway, (518) 587-1500,  fax (518) 587-7800, has an indoor pool, exercise room and business center.  The price is middle range, considering that this town's rates assume everybody has hit an exacta. Rooms are spacious and loaded with amenities, including high-speed Internet access, microwave, hair dryer, refrigerator and a safe big enough for a laptop; from $189 through Labor Day, then $99 to $179.</p>
        <p>At the 42-room Downtowner Motel,  (888) 480-6160, fax (518) 584-2907, under new management, I was happy to step around four cast members of ''Grease,'' starring at the Performing Arts Center but just then doing situps on the floor around the indoor pool. Rooms have been nicely redone, are cheerful and very up to date; from $137 through Labor Day, then $75. It's smack in the middle of everything at 413 Broadway.</p>
        <p>Budget: At the southern end of Broadway, but within a healthy walk of downtown, is the 18-room St. Charles Motel, 188 Broadway, (518) 584-2050, fax (518) 584-6216, with cozy rooms starting at $125 through Labor Day, then $55.</p>
        <p>The Locust Grove Motel is actually in a locust grove about three and a half miles south of town, at 2838 Route 9, Malta; (888) 256-2878, fax (518) 580-1817. It has two 16-unit buildings and two cabin units. Rooms have kitchenettes, at $99 through Labor Day, then $50.</p>
        <p>Luxury: In its second season, the Saratoga Arms, 495-497 Broadway, (518) 584-1775, fax (518) 581-4064, is a magnificently restored Second Empire brick hotel dating from 1870, the year Henry James visited Saratoga.  He would have loved this 16-room hotel rescued from demolition by Kathleen and Noel Smith. Rooms have antique furnishings and high ceilings; several have fireplaces and clawfoot tubs; all have voice mail, data ports, cable TV and CD players; a full Irish breakfast is served.  Rooms from $275 through Labor Day, then from $150.</p>
        <p>The 168-room Holiday Inn, at 232 Broadway, (518) 584-4550, fax (518) 584-4417, is the perfect starting gate for walks into Congress Park or past the period homes on and off Circular Street. It has a full-scale restaurant and bar and a heated outdoor pool. Many of the newly appointed rooms have views of the park or town. Room prices range from $219 through Labor Day, then $150.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Chez Sophie Bistro, 2853 Route 9, Malta, (518) 583-3538, is like a trip to France, serving memorable fare that belies its setting: a converted diner in Malta, three and a half miles south of town. It is run by Sophie Parker, the French-born chef, and her husband, Joseph, a sculptor, assisted by their son, Paul. A recent meal included chanterelles in a reduction of chicken stock and sherry; a salad of baby field greens and organic lettuces, and swordfish pan-sauteed with a sherry wine vinegar vinaigrette, sweet red peppers and shallots. The cheese plate included St. Agur, Reblochon and crottin de Chavignol. Dinner for two with a modest bottle of wine: $110 to $120.</p>
        <p>The hottest place in town is Chianti, 208 South Broadway, (518) 580-0025, with an open kitchen and glowing burnt-sienna decor. Owned by the irrepressible David Zecchini, from Rome, and his wife, Maria, it features the bold tastes of their 31-year-old chef, Fabrizio Bazzani, from Verona. Popular specialties: an appetizer of carpaccio in truffle oil with a Gorgonzola sauce, porcini risotto and a white chocolate gelato requiring a week of penance. Dinner for two with wine: $100.</p>
        <p>Out Union Avenue, just before you hit Saratoga Lake, is the comfortable Longfellows Inn and Restaurant, 500 Union Avenue, (518) 587-0108, created from two dairy barns. High on many diners' lists: the bourbon-glazed salmon and pan-seared tournedos. Dinner for two with wine comes to about $100.</p>
        <p>Joseph DeVivo, talented scion of a well-known Saratoga family, is the maestro of Maestro's, 371 Broadway,  (518) 580-0312, where you dine to the accompaniment of recorded jazz and blues in the heart of town. Specialities include osso bucco, crab cakes and freshly made pastas. Dinner and wine for two: $70.</p>
        <p>With its Southern fried chicken, such Louisiana specialties as Creole jambalaya, and red snapper Provencal, Hattie's, 45 Phila Street, (518) 584-4790, is the real deal for bargain hunters. At this convivial down-home restaurant, two can dine with a bottle of wine for $50; there is also a late menu, with many items under $7, from 10:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>At Ashleigh's, 506 Broadway, (518) 580-0329, you can get a fine breakfast, such as a sausage-potato-cheese omelet, for under $7. Or a lunch of grilled chicken with bacon, cheese and barbecue sauce on a roll, under $7. Or, starting this season, a steak, seafood or pasta dinner for two with wine for less than $40. It's a pleasant, airy spot, and this being Saratoga, it's in a corner of a magnificent Romanesque revival building.</p>
