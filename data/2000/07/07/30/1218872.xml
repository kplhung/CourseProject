        <p>Vanguard Group plans to introduce new class of low-expense mutual-fund shares for investors who have held $50,000 in a fund account for at least 10 years, or $150,000 for at least three years (M)</p>

        <p>The Vanguard Group plans to reward its largest and most loyal retail customers with a new class of low-expense fund shares.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, retail shareholders, including those in individual retirement programs, who have held $50,000 in a fund account for at least 10 years, or $150,000 for at least three years, will be eligible to switch into the new class of shares, called Admiral shares. Any investor with at least $250,000 in a retail fund account can also get in. Conversion to the new share class should not create a tax liability for most investors, the company said.</p>
        <p>Administrative expenses will be one-quarter to one-third lower than those of Vanguard's traditional fund shares, already the industry's lowest, John Demming, a Vanguard spokesman, told Bloomberg News.</p>
        <p>For example, Admiral shares of the Vanguard Index 500 fund would pay expenses of 0.12 percent a year; ordinary shares of the fund now pay 0.18 percent a year.</p>
        <p>''The costs of acquiring and establishing a new account are significant and rising, and in the mutual fund industry those costs are disproportionately borne by long-term shareholders,'' said John J. Brennan, chairman of Vanguard, in a statement. ''In addition, retail shareholders who have maintained sizable accounts for a long period of time and have not caused a fund to incur transaction costs are very desirable.'' Such accounts help hold costs down for all investors, the statement added.</p>
        <p>Vanguard investors who do not qualify for Admiral shares would see no change or a ''minimal'' increase in the expense charges they pay, perhaps two or three hundredths of a percentage point, the company told Reuters.</p>
        <p>Vanguard plans to offer Admiral class shares on its index funds starting in the fourth quarter, with most of its equity, bond and balanced funds to follow in 2001.</p>
