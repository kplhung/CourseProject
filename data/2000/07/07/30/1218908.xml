        <p>The Rev. Jack Ruimb, senior pastor of a congregation in the western highlands of Papua New Guinea, has by his own count founded 321 churches in that South Pacific nation since 1978. When he visits villages to speak about Jesus, Mr. Ruimb said, he sometimes shows movies of another evangelist preaching. ''I use most of Billy's films,'' he said.</p>
        <p>By Billy, he meant the Rev. Billy Graham, whose organization, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, has gathered Mr. Ruimb and 10,000 other evangelists from 190 countries in Amsterdam this weekend for a conference billed as the largest such event ever held.</p>
        <p>Amsterdam 2000, as the gathering is called, has turned a rambling convention center into an extraordinary crossroads of evangelical Christianity.</p>
        <p>In the space of minutes, a visitor can encounter the head of a Protestant seminary in Pakistan, a Presbyterian pastor from Sudan and a married couple of Salvation Army majors from the United States.</p>
        <p>The makeup of the largely male group of participants reflects the trend now marking Christianity: the faith's shift toward the Southern Hemisphere as the number of Christians expands rapidly in Asia and Africa while remaining little changed or even declining in northern countries. Lutherans in southern Africa, for example, now outnumber those in North America.</p>
        <p>This trend accelerated sharply with the demise of colonialism four decades ago. Churches, like governments, passed into local hands, and the Scriptures were translated into native languages, noted the Rev. Ian T. Douglas, associate professor of world mission and global Christianity at Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>''That shift from being a church of the Western, industrialized nations to being a church of Asia, Africa and the Pacific has happened within the lifetime of most Christians,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He called it as significant a development within Christianity as the faith's earlier and much more gradual shift in its center of gravity from the Mediterranean to northern Europe and North America.</p>
        <p>The conference is symbolic in a personal way, for Mr. Graham. In material distributed beforehand, the event is being described as a ''passing of the torch'' from the 81-year-old evangelist to a new generation of preachers. (However, Mr. Graham has given no indication he will retire, and indeed plans to preach in Jacksonville, Fla., in November.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham was forced to cancel plans to speak at its opening session tonight. He is staying in the United States on doctors' orders, after undergoing recent surgery to relieve a buildup of fluid on the brain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham also abandoned plans to address the conference tonight by satellite. Instead, his son conveyed the evangelist's greetings and read a brief statement from his father.</p>
        <p>The Graham association released a short statement explaining that Mr. Graham had ''felt he lacked the energy and strength, following a sleepless night, to deliver his opening remarks.''</p>
        <p>William Martin, a professor of sociology at Rice University in Houston and author of a Billy Graham biography, said the conference seemed a fitting place to speak of passing the torch. ''I believe the true successor to Billy Graham is not going to be any single person,'' he said. ''The circumstances are not likely to permit it or encourage it. He sees his own legacy not as one person, but as these tens of thousands of evangelists preaching all over the world.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham's absence has heightened the role here of his eldest son, Franklin, who is his father's designated successor as head of the Graham association.</p>
        <p>In an interview, the younger Mr. Graham, 48, president of a Christian relief organization called Samaritan's Purse, said his father ''took a nose dive, healthwise,'' after he finished a public preaching event in Nashville, last month. ''It was a dangerous situation,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Admitted to the Mayo Clinic, Billy Graham had two shunts implanted to drain the fluid and relieve the pressure on his brain. His condition has improved markedly, and he is being treated on an outpatient basis.</p>
        <p>In its 50 years, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association has built ties to churches and other Christian organizations throughout the world. It relied on them, a spokesman said, to screen the 28,000 applicants who wanted to come to Amsterdam, selecting the 10,000 expected here.</p>
        <p>Mike Southwell, an official of the association, said the conference was intended particularly to bring in people under 45, who were ''significantly involved'' in evangelism but rarely attended a big religious conference.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Solomon Kendagor, a Kenyan, and his wife, Ruby, a Canadian citizen born in Trinidad, illustrate the crosscultural trends of modern Christianity. In St. Louis, they train Americans to reach out to foreign students.</p>
        <p>''The students we work with, not all of them will become Christians,'' Mrs. Kendagor said, ''but they will go back to their native countries and say: 'Yes, Christianity is true. People showed kindness to me.' ''</p>
