        <p>Pat Riley, president and coach of Miami Heat, is on verge of completing deal that would bring Eddie Jones from Charlotte Hornets to Heat in sign-and-trade deal that would also bring Jamal Mashburn and Clarence Weatherspoon to Hornets in exchange for Jones and Ricky Davis (M)</p>

        <p>He almost had Juwan Howard four years ago, but the league voided the deal and sent Howard back to Washington. At different junctures, Pat Riley was also on the verge of bringing Mitch Richmond and Latrell Sprewell to Miami, only to see his grand pursuit of talent end in frustration.</p>
        <p>But for the first time in the last four years, Riley, the Heat president and coach, finally seems to be homing in on adding an All-Star caliber player to his athletically challenged roster.</p>
        <p>Eddie Jones will very likely be headed to South Florida in the next few days, an Eastern Conference team official said Friday on the condition of anonymity. Jones is hoping to leave Charlotte in a sign-and-trade deal that would bring Jamal Mashburn and Clarence Weatherspoon to the Hornets in exchange for the All-Star shooting guard and Charlotte's Ricky Davis, the official said.</p>
        <p>Several factors could hold up the deal, including a deadline of Friday night imposed by Jones on the club last week to work out an arrangement with the Heat. But Jones only appeared to be killing his own leverage with the ultimatum.</p>
        <p>Rather than reap the maximum allowable contract the Heat can offer him -- roughly $86 million over seven years -- Jones would have two options: take another team's $2.25 million exception with the unwritten promise that he would be compensated after next season, or sign for the maximum with the Chicago Bulls.</p>
        <p>The other potential holdup may be David Falk, Glen Rice's agent. The official said Falk was scheming up a pitch for the Bulls, who have $19 million in salary-cap space but little talent after most of the league's top-tier free agents spurned them the past month.</p>
        <p>If Falk's plan comes to fruition, the official said, the Bulls would acquire Jones and Rice to fill vacancies at small forward and shooting guard and keep United Center ticket revenues from spiraling into the abyss. The Hornets need to clear cap room to complete the transaction with the Heat. They need a third team with a salary-cap exception to take a player like Brad Miller to make sure Jones gets the maximum deal.</p>
        <p>Riley was vehement about not losing two starters in a deal for Jones, which helps explain why he refused to part with both Mashburn and P. J. Brown. But he is getting antsy for a player who can help elevate his team past the Knicks and the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference.</p>
        <p>Before the second-round series against the Knicks last May, he was asked if the well-traveled rookie Anthony Carter fit into the Riley mold of role players he has coached in the past. ''I love these kind of guys with big hearts,'' Riley said. ''But I'd also like to get some big talent one of these days, too.''</p>
        <p>Magic a Big Winner</p>
        <p>With free agents able to sign Tuesday, Orlando appears to be the big winner in the summer sweepstakes. Procuring Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady -- and possibly Maurice Taylor -- should make the Magic a bona fide playoff threat again.</p>
        <p>But its chances of competing immediately for a championship were severely dimmed when Tim Duncan chose to stay in San Antonio, where the All-Star center is expected to sign a three-year deal with a fourth-year option totaling more than $45 million.</p>
        <p>On the surface, the Magic acquired one of the top-five players in the game along with one of the most breathtaking young players. If Taylor agrees to a deal in the next few days -- he is still hedging and may wind up in Indiana, which has a $4.3 million exception to offer him -- Coach Doc Rivers has another great offensive player to put on the floor.</p>
        <p>NBC even went so far as to include 10 regular-season Magic games on their 2000-01 network schedule.</p>
        <p>Peel back the facade, though: John Amaechi, still learning the game, is Orlando's center. Hill is coming off major foot surgery. Neither he nor McGrady has yet to win a playoff series. For all his ability, Taylor is coming over from the Clippers.</p>
        <p>The Magic has some nice pieces and will be entertaining. But after the oodles of cash were doled out, the Magic still has gaping holes, the kind only Duncan could have fixed.</p>
        <p>Still, General Manager John Gabriel did his best to secure the pick of the litter over the last few months.</p>
        <p>If Eddie Jones ends up in Miami, the Chicago Bulls have to go down as the major disappointment of the summer. Ron Mercer, Derek Anderson or -- who knows? -- Isaiah Rider may be their big acquisition.</p>
        <p>It has been a particularly rough off-season for General Manager Jerry Krause, whose promise to rebuild the franchise may have to wait yet another season. After enduring two years of the draft lottery, you wonder if Bulls fans can deal with another dismal season after six championships in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>One of the top free agents next season is Chris Webber, a power forward. In Elton Brand and the recently drafted Marcus Fizer, the Bulls have a surplus at the position.</p>
        <p>After Hill and McGrady committed themselves to Orlando, the Bulls seemed to have their heart set on Milwaukee forward Tim Thomas. But he deftly used Chicago for leverage, securing a maximum contract from the Bucks.</p>
        <p>There is a still chance that Jermaine O'Neal will be dealt to Chicago for a combination of players that may include the rookie point guard Jamal Crawford. But that remains to be seen.</p>
        <p>If Krause does not shock everyone with a blockbuster deal in the next two months -- given his cunning and savvy, it's not an impossibility -- the post-Michael-and-Scottie Bulls are headed in the same direction as the powerhouse Celtics of the 1980's. Boston is still searching for a playoff berth years after Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish retired.</p>
        <p>Knicks Seem Dormant</p>
        <p>The Knicks spent time and money courting Grant Hill and Brian Grant the past month, time and money that apparently went to waste and made some of their current players question the franchise's loyalty.</p>
        <p>What's more, Patrick Ewing, the player whom Dave Checketts has often said ''will retire a Knick,'' wants more years and more money.</p>
        <p>The window on the Knicks' championship hopes is always said to be perpetually closing, one bad bounce away from the draft lottery. And just as they slip below the tier of elite teams, the Knicks find a way to end up deep in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>But if the Knicks cannot pull off a deal for a legitimate rebounder in the next few months, they have no shot at returning to the finals. At a time when Miami and Orlando are upgrading and Indiana is mostly holding onto the team that came within three victories of a title, the Knicks are running out of capable big men.</p>
        <p>Reiterating his comments in March about playing three more seasons, Ewing said last week that he planned to play one more season in New York and then go somewhere else if the Knicks did not extend his contract.</p>
        <p>The Knicks remember how well Ewing played the last time he wanted an exorbitant contract. In the 1996-97 season -- his last injury-free, productive season -- he was in All-Star form. But now he almost seems out of touch with his own talent. Unlike many aging former All-Stars, he has no comprehension of his declining skill and agility.</p>
        <p>Would the Knicks pay Ewing for two more seasons given that he has spent much of the past three years on the injured list? It is unlikely. Meanwhile, their backup center, Chris Dudley, will very likely have his contract bought out at the end of this season.</p>
        <p>That leaves the Knicks with a glut of power forwards and shooting guards. Without capable big men, Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell are basically Grant Hill and Jerry Stackhouse, and the Knicks are a lower-echelon playoff team that goes home in early May.</p>
        <p>Unless General Manager Scott Layden can find a way to land an impact post player, the good times at Madison Square Garden will soon come to an end.</p>
