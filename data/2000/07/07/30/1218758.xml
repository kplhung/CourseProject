        <p>SUMMER'S berries may inspire the baker of pies and cakes, but with an abundance of fresh raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries and even gooseberries and currants, there are lighter options.</p>
        <p>An updated Jell-O mold, for example, made with raspberries and green tea, can provide a refreshing finale to a summer dinner. A similar cool delight, a fruit soup made with berries and watermelon, is finished with an icy watermelon granita.</p>
        <p>Even baking can be a delicate affair, as with the custardy gratin of blueberries seasoned with a whiff of ginger and baked in the oven until lightly browned, then cooled a bit before serving.</p>
        <p>Raspberry and Tea Terrine  Total time: 15 minutes plus chilling</p>
        <p>6 1/2 cups fresh raspberries  Juice and grated zest of 1 lime  8 tablespoons sugar  1 1/4 cups freshly brewed green tea  2 envelopes unflavored gelatin  Whipped cream, creme fraiche or sweetened plain yogurt.</p>
        <p>1. Put six cups of raspberries in a bowl. Toss with lime juice, zest and two tablespoons of sugar.</p>
        <p>2. Put a fourth of a cup of tea in a small bowl, add gelatin and stir to soften. Transfer to a small saucepan, stir in remaining tea and heat gently just until gelatin dissolves. Stir in six tablespoons of sugar. Pour hot gelatin mixture over the raspberries. It should just cover the berries.</p>
        <p>3. Transfer mixture to a six-cup loaf pan or porcelain terrine. Alternatively, mixture can be spooned into six large wine goblets. Refrigerate at least an hour, until the mixture is firm, then serve in slices or individual servings with cream on the side or as a topping and remaining fresh raspberries for garnish.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Blueberry-Ginger Gratin  Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 1/2 cups blueberries  1 tablespoon slivered crystallized ginger  2 eggs, separated</p>
        <p>1/2 cup sugar</p>
        <p>1/4 cup orange juice  2 tablespoons flour</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger  1 cup heavy cream  Pinch of salt  Confectioners' sugar.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter eight-inch gratin dish with half a tablespoon of butter. Spread blueberries in dish.</p>
        <p>2. Beat egg yolks with the sugar until creamy and thick. Beat in the remaining butter, then beat in orange juice. Whisk flour and ground ginger together and stir in alternately with cream.</p>
        <p>3. Beat egg whites with pinch of salt until stiff but not dry. Fold into egg yolk mixture and spread over berries. Put in oven and bake about 30 minutes, until browned on top.</p>
        <p>4. Remove from oven and allow to cool about 15 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar, then serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Berry-Watermelon Soup With Watermelon Granita  Total time: 30 minutes  plus chilling and freezing</p>
        <p>2 cups rose wine</p>
        <p>1/2 cup granulated sugar  Juice of 1 lemon  6 cups cubed watermelon, seeded  4 cups mixed fresh berries: strawberries, currants, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, raspberries, boysenberries</p>
        <p>1/2teaspoon ground cardamom  1 1/2 tablespoons superfine sugar  2 tablespoons finely slivered mint leaves.</p>
        <p>1. Put a cup of wine in a saucepan, stir in granulated sugar and heat until the sugar dissolves. Add lemon juice. Puree half of the watermelon in a food processor. Mix the watermelon puree and the sweetened wine mixture together in a metal bowl. Set the bowl in a larger bowl of ice and water until the mixture cools, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a shallow metal pan, put in the freezer and freeze until the mixture is solid, at least six hours or overnight.</p>
        <p>2. If using strawberries, quarter them. If using currants and blueberries, set them aside. Put half the berries, including strawberries but not currants and blueberries, along with remaining watermelon, the cardamom and superfine sugar, in food processor and puree. Pass puree through a sieve.</p>
        <p>3. Transfer mixture to a bowl and stir in wine. Refrigerate the mixture for at least an hour.</p>
        <p>4. To serve, divide puree among six soup plates or large goblets. Spoon remaining berries, including currants and blueberries if using, into soup. Use a tablespoon to scrape frozen watermelon granita from pan and mound some in center of each soup plate. Scatter mint on top. Serve at once.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
