        <p>Gov. George W. Bush swung through another battleground state today, proclaiming that the days of Republican losses were over. ''We haven't won Kentucky lately,'' he thundered, ''but that's going to change come November.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush promised to bring a new tone to Washington as he crisscrossed Kentucky on the second day of his march to the Republican National Convention. He drew large crowds, despite downpours and drizzle, with people lined up under umbrellas to shake his hand.</p>
        <p>''If you're sick of the politics of personal destruction, there's a place for you in this campaign,'' Mr. Bush shouted to an audience that crammed into an airport hangar in Owensboro and spilled out into the rain-drenched tarmac. ''If you want somebody to unite the nation, there's a place for you in this campaign.''</p>
        <p>His words today were not aimed as pointedly at President Clinton as they were on Friday when he began his tour in Arkansas, but he still ended every speech promising to uphold ''the honor and the dignity'' of the presidency. He tried for soaring tones, promising ''to lead Americans in new directions.''</p>
        <p>But off the campaign trail, his vice-presidential running mate, Dick Cheney, was not shy about taking on Mr. Clinton. In an interview taped for the program Fox News Sunday, Mr. Cheney said: ''I am generally one of those people who thinks Bill Clinton has been an embarrassment to the country. He is a tragic figure in a way, obviously very bright.'' He said Mr. Clinton has ''an impressive set'' of political skills but has ''fundamental flaws.''</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore's campaign promptly struck back. ''They have been saying for weeks that they would not engage in the politics of personal destruction,'' said Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore. ''But right out of the box they've resorted to old-style Republican politics.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Bush made his way to the convention, gone were his usual small-panel discussions. All across Kentucky, he revved up the kinds of rally crowds not seen since the height of the Republican primaries. Balloons fell. American flags unfurled. Confetti dropped. Rock music blared. And streamers were shot to the rafters. The only thing that went wrong was the breakdown of a backup press plane.</p>
        <p>Everywhere, the crowds were large. As many as 5,000 people chanted his name in a sports arena in Joplin, Mo., on Friday night. Outside the Louisville Slugger Museum, where an oversize baseball bat towers over the building, hundreds more waited in the drizzle for an outdoor rally.</p>
        <p>''I'm pleased by the energy level,'' Mr. Bush told reporters on his campaign plane. He said the audiences were ''like the crowd you'd expect on the last days of the campaign.''</p>
        <p>When the Republican convention opens on Monday, Congressional leaders will be relegated to less desirable time spots, and some of the focus will be on nonpoliticians described by Mr. Bush as ''people who are reinforcing our message.''</p>
        <p>The perils of that approach were on display today when Chris Payne, an employee of a grain company, dressed in his work clothes, kept forgetting his lines as he was introducing Mr. Bush. Several times he stopped midsentence and had to pull a written speech from his pocket.</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry. I'm not a public speaker,'' Mr. Payne said. He then said of Mr. Bush, ''He trusts you and me to make the best decisions,'' which was supposed to be an endorsement for Mr. Bush's plan to divert some of the Social Security payroll tax to individual investment accounts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush took pains to assure older people that his Social Security plan would not affect them but only affect younger workers. ''I want the elderly here in this audience to hear me loud and clear,'' he said. ''Don't be fooled by that kind of politics where they're going to get on your TV screen and try to scare you.''</p>
        <p>''George W. Bush,'' he said, ''will keep the promise to the elderly in America.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also fired up audiences with talk of tax cuts, though he did not explicitly mention his plan to cut taxes by $1.3 trillion over a decade. ''You see, I happen to think the surplus means government has more money than it needs,'' he said to cheers. ''I happen to know that one of the reasons we have a surplus is that the taxes on the people that are working hard are the highest they've been since World War II.</p>
        <p>''There's a big difference in this campaign,'' he roared. ''My opponent thinks the surplus is the government's money. We know the surplus is the people's money.''</p>
        <p>A small crowd of protesters opposed to the death penalty read aloud the names of people executed in Texas and chanted, ''Killed by Bush.'' But they were far outnumbered by Bush supporters. Mr. Bush shouted louder into the microphones, and the sound system mostly drowned out the demonstrators.</p>
        <p>By the time he arrives at the convention on Wednesday morning, Mr. Bush will have passed through three other states that voted for President Clinton in the last two elections -- Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. And Mr. Bush pledged today that both he and Mr. Cheney would appear in swing states during the fall campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said that in previous campaigns, the strategy was often to tell the vice-presidential candidate, ''Head out to solidify the base.</p>
        <p>''But our intention,'' he said, ''is that both of us will be focusing on swing states. I may be there one week and he'll be there the next.''</p>
