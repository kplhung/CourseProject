        <p>The F.B.I. is investigating Mayor Marty Barnes of Paterson to determine if trips he took while in office, some of which were paid for by contractors doing business with the city, constitute a conflict of interest, said Thomas C. Rooney Jr., a city councilman who has led the council's questioning of the expenses. In his three years in office, Mayor Barnes, and sometimes his wife and a contingent of people from City Hall, have visited Switzerland, the Dominican Republic, Russia and  Brazil. The mayor has not provided the council with details of his trips, despite requests. The F.B.I. would not comment on whether an investigation is under way.</p>
