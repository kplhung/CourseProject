        <p>THE SOUL OF A CHEF</p>
        <p>The Journey Toward Perfection.</p>
        <p>By Michael Ruhlman.</p>
        <p>370 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Viking. $26.95.</p>
        <p>HOWEVER knowledgeable Michael Ruhlman might be about cooking, he's still a writer, not a chef. In the hot, airless spaces of restaurant kitchens, he's an interloper, someone who, in this often paranoid and always territorial world, might even be considered an enemy. Nevertheless, in ''The Soul of a Chef: The Journey Toward Perfection,'' Ruhlman sets out to perform a task even restaurant insiders would find difficult: to delve so deeply into the hearts and minds of a few select chefs that he may discover the essence of haute cuisine.</p>
        <p>Amazingly enough, he succeeds -- by turning his investigation into an adventure story, a hold-your-breath-while-you-turn-the-page thriller that's also an anthropological study of the culture of cooking. Filled with telling details and loving descriptions of the actual business of cranking out high-end meals, ''The Soul of a Chef'' left me wondering how Ruhlman would perform under real pressure -- on a busy saute station on a Saturday night. Judging from his book, not too badly.</p>
        <p>Ruhlman's quest for the elusive extra chromosome, childhood trauma or magic potion that drives so many chefs to insanity, despotism, alcoholism and financial ruin on the road to culinary Mecca is a tale told in three parts. In the first, Brian Polcyn of the Five Lakes Grill in Milford, Mich., tries to qualify as a certified master chef at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. At the time of the book's writing, only 53 out of 170 people who had taken the grueling 10-day test had passed. The exam, as Ruhlman points out, is scoffed at by many working professionals, considered an anachronism with obscure criteria for success -- and an overreliance on the wisdom of Auguste Escoffier. ''There is no room for interpretation,'' one judge says, speaking of the classical portion of the test. ''You prepare it the way Mr. E. wrote in the book.''</p>
        <p>In choosing Polcyn, a likable character who cooks from the heart, Ruhlman has done well. Polcyn failed the test once before, which makes his desire to succeed this time even more potentially heartbreaking. And however capricious, antiquated and irrelevant the reader might find the exam itself, you can't help rooting for the beleaguered Polcyn to achieve his dream.</p>
        <p>Ruhlman is no stranger to the C.I.A., having attended classes there for the writing of his excellent earlier book ''The Making of a Chef,'' and he has clearly acquired, both at that institution and in subsequent jaunts in real-world kitchens, much of the ethos and credo of the professional, from the near-religious appreciation of a properly made veal stock to the twisted faux machismo that creates a distinctly confrontational attitude: ''I'm tougher than you, faster than you, better than you. I'm a chef. I work in inhuman temperatures, and I like it that way. I don't have to sleep every day if there's work to be done now; you get the work done. Only got a couple hours' sleep last night, and you've got 18 more hours of work ahead of you. Good. You like that. You're a chef. You can sleep later.''</p>
        <p>Ruhlman closely follows the judging of a number of the contestants, all of whom have been working in the industry and have absorbed this mantra into their very cell tissue. The story of their successes and failures, their behavior under pressure, their ultimate ejection or near ejection from the competition, makes exhilarating reading. Along the way, Ruhlman neatly explains why chefs are by nature so prickly, so fatalistic, so disappointed with the world outside their kitchens: ''People who weren't chefs . . . didn't understand the true demands of kitchen work, and so didn't have the same ideas about efficiency, speed, hustle, getting things done, perfect work, and so don't understand chefs. . . . Chefs don't understand them either. Construction on the new restaurant kitchen not done? . . . the chef asks. . . . A chef cannot fathom this. What? Would one of his line cooks at 5:30 say, 'Sorry, Chef, not ready for the service'? . . . Of course not.''</p>
        <p>Michael Symon of Cleveland's Lola Bistro and Wine Bar, the focus of the book's second part, might be described as a cook of the old school -- a talented, even inspired, journeyman professional, the owner and chef of a thriving new business. A line cook and prolific schmoozer, Symon is another subject for whom the reader immediately has sympathy, and Ruhlman's account of a typical day at his very busy restaurant is dead on target. There are also plenty of revealing detours, like this reflection on the nature of grease: ''Grease was the bane of restaurants. If you weren't after it constantly, it coated everything and then collected more of itself between layers of dirt. . . . The grease . . . is simply omnipresent in the air, like pollen on a severe hay fever day. . . . Saute pans in virtually every restaurant kitchen in America describe the true color of grease best. . . . These were the kinds that turned black as pitch on the bottom from fired-on grease and carbon . . . bent and rippled from the heat and abuse of the cooks.''</p>
        <p>The drama in this second segment comes from the arrival of a vaunted food writer who, Ruhlman slyly informs us, has been induced to visit Cleveland after a persistent lobbying effort by local restaurant folk -- and the promise of free lodging and food. The whole painful process of preparing for his arrival, and the meal that follows, are scrupulously recounted, as is the pathetically insubstantial payoff: a breezy mention in a puffy, unfelt column.</p>
        <p>Finally, in the third section of the book, Ruhlman scales the heights of culinary Olympus and gives us a window into the kitchen of America's most respected and envied chef, the Mad Monk of Napa Valley, Thomas Keller of the French Laundry. As co-author with Keller of ''The French Laundry Cookbook,'' a work that even jaded career chefs consider the ultimate in food porn, Ruhlman is ideally situated to explain the source of a great chef's monomania.</p>
        <p>Keller's food, it should be pointed out, is generally regarded as beautiful, extraordinary and almost impossible to recreate. He himself is the subject of legend in the food industry, and many of the rumored anecdotes appear here, confirmed at last. There's the rabbit story, in which Keller, determined to learn how to skin, gut and butcher what he's going to cook, is left with 11 live rabbits and, despite their screaming, does the job himself, snapping their little necks before dressing them for the pot. And the ''Little Green Bag'' story, in which the chef bombards his crew, over and over, with ''K. Billy Super Sounds of the 70's'' and the soundtrack from ''Reservoir Dogs.''</p>
        <p>While Ruhlman's description of Keller's early years in the culinary wilderness is somewhat incomplete, he atones for it by getting his subject to make some startlingly frank admissions. But it's one crystallizing moment, with Ruhlman and Keller chatting in the twilight on the deck of Ruhlman's house, that makes ''The Soul of a Chef'' a book worthy of its title. Pondering the roots of his perfectionism, Keller announces that he owes it all to his mother and her devotion to hard work and attending to details: ''You clean the bathroom, which was my job. There was only one way to do it. Everything had to shine. Everything had to be just perfect. . . . To this day, no matter what I do, it's kind of based on cleaning the bathroom.''</p>
