        <p>Well-Stocked Wizardry</p>
        <p>Q. Considering the consumer frenzy surrounding ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' I was amazed to see copies on the shelves of the New York Public Library on July 8, the day the book was published. Did the library take special measures?</p>
        <p>A. Yes. The New York Public Library ordered 934 copies of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' (Levine Books/Scholastic Press) to ensure that each of its 85 branches in the Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island had the book on the shelves on July 8. The fourth book in J. K. Rowling's series, it was by far the largest single-title order in the library's history, according to a library spokeswoman, Jennifer Bertrand.</p>

        <p>Well-Stocked Wizardry</p>
        <p>Q. Considering the consumer frenzy surrounding ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' I was amazed to see copies on the shelves of the New York Public Library on July 8, the day the book was published. Did the library take special measures?</p>
        <p>A. Yes. The New York Public Library ordered 934 copies of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' (Levine Books/Scholastic Press) to ensure that each of its 85 branches in the Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island had the book on the shelves on July 8. The fourth book in J. K. Rowling's series, it was by far the largest single-title order in the library's history, according to a library spokeswoman, Jennifer Bertrand.</p>
        <p>The book, moreover, turned a rare library hat trick, making its debut simultaneously in the children's, adult and young adult sections.</p>
        <p>Historical comparisons are difficult, since new copies of popular books are ordered constantly, but to put the matter in perspective, the library has bought a total of 900 copies of ''Charlotte's Web'' since it was published in 1952. Among recent children's best sellers, the library has 250 copies of ''Oh, the Places You'll Go!'' by Dr. Seuss (Random House), and 350 copies of Shel Silverstein's ''Falling Up'' (HarperCollins). On the adult side, it has stocked 590 hardcover copies of ''Angela's Ashes,'' Frank McCourt's enormously popular memoir, since it was published by Scribner in 1996.</p>
        <p>Most of the library's copies of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' were spoken for, since 734 ''holds'' -- which guarantee a patron a copy of the book when it becomes available -- were placed before the book reached the shelves. Two weeks ago, that number had passed 900.</p>
        <p>The Queens Borough Public Library and the Brooklyn Public Library, which are independent library systems, ordered 300 and 400 copies, respectively.</p>
        <p>On Duty, Even When Off</p>
        <p>Q. I often see news reports of crimes that were thwarted or interrupted by off-duty police officers, but it has never been clear to me exactly what their responsibilities are. Do off-duty officers have the right to ignore a crime in progress?</p>
        <p>A. No. ''It's a misconception to think there are some rules laid out saying this is what you can do and this is what you can't do,'' said Detective Walter L. Burns, a police spokesman. ''As a police officer your responsibility is always to enforce the law, on duty or off duty. You might not have a gun, you might be out with your wife or kids, you might be with your grandmother or pushing a stroller, all of those things, but you still have the same responsibility.''</p>
        <p>This does not mean that officers are required to jeopardize their lives, and in many cases the wisest action is simply to pay close attention, call for help or render aid. ''The bottom line is -- the department is very clear -- they expect you to take what we call 'necessary action,' '' Detective Burns said. ''Necessary action is defined based on the situation, and it will differ in each circumstance. It may be walking to the phone, dialing 911 and asking for a uniformed officer. But you do not have the right to walk away from that situation and not do anything.''</p>
        <p>Jan and Dean on Cable</p>
        <p>Q. Didn't New York once have a ''Dead Man's Curve''?</p>
        <p>A. Yes. The term referred to a sharp S curve on the Broadway cable car line at Union Square during the 1890's. To avoid stalling in the middle, cable cars had to enter the curve at a furious speed and refrain entirely from braking, often striking unwary vehicles and pedestrians caught in their path. The mayhem didn't end until electric streetcars were introduced in the early 1900's.</p>
