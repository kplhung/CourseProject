        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Yigal Amir, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassin, might perhaps be characterized as ultranationalist but certainly not as ''ultra-religious'' (''The Holiest City, the Toughest Conflict,'' Week in Review, July 23). He has consistently maintained that his act of murder was motivated entirely by political, not religious, beliefs.</p>
        <p>Many religious Jews, to be sure, like many other Jews and non-Jews alike, may be intensely skeptical of some Palestinians' intentions regarding Israel and its Jewish citizens. But discourse, democracy and prayer, not violence, are the means we use to advance our convictions and hopes.</p>
        <p>(Rabbi) AVI SHAFRAN  New York, July 23, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is director of public affairs, Agudath Israel of America.</p>
