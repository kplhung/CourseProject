        <p>In raising the prospect of moving the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, President Clinton was responding to an unusual request from Prime Minister Ehud Barak as he left the failed Camp David peace talks to help shore up his political position back home, administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>The president's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said today that President Clinton had decided to use an interview on Israeli television Friday as a platform to support Mr. Barak, who had explained to Mr. Clinton the difficult political situation he faced in Israel during a parting conversation at Camp David.</p>
        <p>''The president said that the United States would stand by those who took risks for peace,'' Mr. Berger said. He acknowledged that Mr. Clinton's statement on Jerusalem was more ''forward leaning'' than in the past and closer to a readiness to make the move.</p>
        <p>The seemingly spontaneous remark from the president, who said unprompted that he had ''always wanted'' to move the embassy to Jerusalem, was actually carefully vetted beforehand by American negotiators who had accompanied Mr. Clinton to Camp David, and came after Mr. Barak had specifically asked Mr. Clinton to raise the issue.</p>
        <p>In addition to his appeal to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Barak also called a number of congressmen on Thursday asking them to introduce a resolution on moving the embassy, according to officials familiar with the calls.</p>
        <p>Among those Mr. Barak telephoned was the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee.</p>
        <p>A senior American official acknowledged today that Mr. Clinton believed that moving the American stance forward might  help Mr. Barak survive a no-confidence vote scheduled in Parliament for Monday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, who returned home to raucous criticism in Parliament for the concessions he was prepared to make to the Palestinians -- including on the status of Jerusalem -- is considered absolutely vital by the administration for any chance of continuing the peace talks.</p>
        <p>The administration has been monitoring political developments in Israel almost hourly as Mr. Barak faces the no-confidence vote. By some calculations, if he loses the votes of only two legislators who supported him on the last no-confidence vote, he will be forced to call new elections. Mr. Barak lost his parliamentary majority on the eve of coming to the Camp David talks.</p>
        <p>Explaining Mr. Clinton's television appearance, Mr. Berger said, ''We decided it was important to speak to the Israeli people and tell them the kind of leadership Barak had shown at Camp David.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's public proclamation on the embassy was considered extraordinary because in the past, the administration has been careful to tamp down any enthusiasm in Congress for such a move. Some Israeli prime ministers, including Yitzhak Rabin, have also been careful not to encourage the issue, on the grounds that it would unnecessarily inflame the Palestinians and set back peace prospects.</p>
        <p>Asked today whether Mr. Clinton's statement would also serve to help his wife, Hillary, who is running for the United States Senate in New York, a senior administration official said, ''It had nothing to do with it.''</p>
        <p>Another official said, however, that White House officials were aware that a positive answer on moving the embassy would not hurt Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>In reviewing the parameters of what Mr. Clinton would say in the interview, American negotiators weighted his position that he would consider moving the embassy as a 6 on a scale of 10.</p>
        <p>On the lowest end of the scale, Mr. Clinton could have said -- as the White House has in the past -- that it did not want to jeopardize the peace efforts by advocating a move. On the high end, Mr. Clinton could have said he wanted to move the embassy, a position that the White House ultimately decided was too forward.</p>
