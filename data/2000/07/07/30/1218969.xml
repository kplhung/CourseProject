        <p>A HIT animated series about a family of documentary filmmakers would seem about as likely a prospect for children's television as persuading the stern primatologist Jane Goodall to become a guest star.</p>
        <p>The producers of ''The Wild Thornberrys'' have managed both.</p>
        <p>The series, which made its debut on Nickelodeon in 1998, has become a sleeper success. Without spinoff trading cards, video games or even a superhero, it has become one of the top five series among viewers ages 2 to 11. Its 12-year-old heroine, Eliza, seems unassuming, too, with glasses, freckles and a retainer that shines as brightly as the African sun, which often beats down on her exploits.</p>
        <p>Eliza, however, is not as average as she looks. She has a secret power: she can talk to animals. The rest of the unusual Thornberry clan includes Donnie, a 4-year-old feral foundling, and Darwin, an aptly named chimpanzee. Eliza's father, Nigel, a kind of British Marty Stouffer (of ''Wild America'' fame), is the host of nature documentaries filmed by her American mother, Marianne. The most ordinary character is Debbie, Eliza's teenage sister, whose native habitat seems to be more San Fernando Valley than Siberia, Serengeti or the many other places the roving family visits.</p>
        <p>Eliza is endearing because ''she's got this magical power that she doesn't abuse,'' said Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon's executive vice president and general manager.</p>
        <p>''And,'' Ms. Zarghami added, ''she is a hero to the animals.''</p>
        <p>That heroism has not gone unnoticed by the world outside television. Recently ''The Wild Thornberrys'' received a Genesis Award, given annually by the Ark Trust, a nonprofit animal-protection organization, to members of the news and entertainment media for their portrayals of animal issues. The series won in animated children's programming for three episodes that taught about ecology -- a major mission of the producers, Klasky Csupo, the company that also created ''Rugrats.''</p>
        <p>Just as big a coup was winning Dr. Goodall's participation. In an episode that is to coincide with Earth Day, in April 2001 , Eliza will meet Dr. Goodall, who will be the voice for herself.</p>
        <p>Dr. Goodall's signing on ''felt like having the wildlife version of the Good Housekeeping seal,'' said Eryk Casemiro, senior vice president for creative affairs at Klasky Csupo.</p>
        <p>''One thing she's strong about is not wanting to domesticate chimpanzees,'' said Mr. Casemiro. ''Eliza can't tell her she has a chimpanzee that wants to be domesticated because she can talk to him.'' After some careful script writing, Dr. Goodall gave her approval.</p>
        <p>Realism, in fact, is one of the standards of the series, which is broadcast weekdays at 8 a.m., Tuesday nights at 8 and Wednesdays from 2 tou 5 p.m. The animators create backdrops that reflect the topography of each country visited. The composer, Drew Neumann, uses indigenous instruments in his scores. And the plots faithfully portray the habits and habitats of the creatures Eliza encounters, from Komodo dragons to Sumatran hairy rhinos. Last season a week was devoted to highlighting endangered species, and the producers are considering bringing back one of the characters, a panda cub, next season. The episodes also featured the natural death of an elephant matriarch.</p>
        <p>''That was the heaviest we've gotten,'' Mr. Casemiro said. ''We're very cautious.'' But he is proud of the result. ''It's fascinating that elephants bury their dead,'' he said. ''We also had a poaching show, and we did it without guns.''</p>
        <p>In addition to drama, ''The Wild Thornberrys'' offers humor and more than a little star power. Lacey Chabert, of the Fox series ''Party of Five,'' provides Eliza's voice, and the actor Tim Curry contributes Nigel's. Donnie, the feral child, has the voice of Flea, from the rock band the Red Hot Chili Peppers. And Betty White and Ed Asner have been featured as Eliza's grandparents.</p>
        <p>This September Jonathan Taylor Thomas, who became a heartthrob on ABC's ''Home Improvement,'' will have a recurring role as Eliza's visiting cousin, ''who thinks he's cooler and more adventurous,'' Mr. Casemiro said. The cousins, at first competitive, eventually become close.</p>
        <p>The real secret to the show's popularity, though, is probably Eliza's own. Only Darwin and the viewers are aware of her power. ''That's one of the special things about 'Rugrats' -- there's a secret between the audience and the babies,'' Ms. Zarghami said, and the complicity contributes to the success of both series. Just as much fun as watching animals in the wild, apparently, is seeing grown-ups trapped in the dark.</p>
