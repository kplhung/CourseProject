        <p>HARRY GOLD</p>
        <p>By Millicent Dillon.</p>
        <p>280 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>The Overlook Press. $26.95.</p>
        <p>To be a spy is a bit like having a secret love affair. Despite the occasional sense of romance and adventure, spying involves leading a double life concealed behind a filigree of deceptions and betrayals. If you're caught at either, you're likely to be punished for daring to subvert society's moral framework. Espionage involves drama, risk and danger. Or does it? Millicent Dillon's new novel about Harry Gold, the American chemist who acted as a spy for the Soviet Union in the 1930's and 40's, suggests otherwise.</p>
        <p>In a scene depicting Gold's trial in 1950, Dillon quotes Gold's lawyer, John D. M. Hamilton, as saying: ''I come here to explain a crime and not to excuse one. I come here to state a case and not to plead one.'' Dillon follows this lead by tracing Gold's story in precise and subdued prose, and combining her factual knowledge of his life with imagined detail and poetic texture. Like her character, the author has a double identity here, alternating between a biographer's and a novelist's voice and point of view. (It is a double identity that may come naturally to Dillon: the author of three previous works of fiction, she has also published biographies of Paul and Jane Bowles, among others.)</p>
        <p>Unusually, Dillon the biographer inserts herself into the novel as a first-person narrator, and in this role she is honest enough to define her main weakness -- and the book's most rewarding challenge -- which is, as she puts it at one point, ''watching from the outside, thinking I was watching from the inside.''</p>
        <p>From the outside, Dillon shows us a small, barely noticeable man who leads a simple, poor, dutiful life with his Russian Jewish parents and younger brother in Philadelphia. It is 1932, there is rampant unemployment and he is the family's sole support. When he too loses his job and is miraculously offered a new one by the friend of a friend, Harry doesn't realize that this friendship is motivated by a plan to recruit him as a courier for the Russians. Dillon shows an interesting dichotomy between Gold's refusal to join the Communist Party, whose teachings he finds unimpressive, and his readiness to become a spy, simply out of a sense of commitment to a friend and his belief that the Russian people need his help.</p>
        <p>He begins by sneaking scientific information out of his own lab and sharing it with the Soviet Union via a clandestine contact; although his tasks grow in importance, he will always remain a minor courier -- dependable and practically invisible. His greatest claim to fame will be his connection with the German emigre physicist Klaus Fuchs, one of the masterminds behind the first atom bomb. He is also a witness for the prosecution at the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.</p>
        <p>But who is this man, and does his story give us any clues about his inner life? If a biographer is a well-informed voyeur, what, then, is a novelist? Where is the boundary between fact and fiction when writing about the life of a real person? Dillon's Gold is perfectly convincing as a fictional character, but for all we know he may not correspond to the real person: somewhat confusingly, biography bleeds here into fiction.</p>
        <p>This secret agent is well removed from our romantic image of spies. He never seeks to be paid for his services; he has no ideology; he is unusually kind, reliable and selfless. He is a painfully ordinary man and -- it must be said -- a boring one; yet his blandness is a cover for a terrible neediness and loneliness. Harry becomes infatuated with almost every single one of his contacts (especially Fuchs, with whom he feels ''caught up in the forces of history, at a critical juncture of life and matter''), sees them as friends and is crushed when they leave him. It seems that he is not so much spying for the Soviet Union as looking for soul mates. And no wonder: his double life results in his being doubly lonely -- he is not allowed to marry. One of the novel's most moving touches is Gold's attachment to an imaginary wife and children.</p>
        <p>By the time we are shown Gold's trial, where he is jeered by a hostile, anti-Semitic crowd and sentenced to 30 years in prison, he has become an almost tragic figure -- yet still an enigma.</p>
        <p>''Harry Gold'' is a fascinating and original book. It answers few questions, and asks many good ones. Yet it would have been a better and more interesting novel if the biographer had been less inclined to interfere with the novelist's freedom to tell a good -- even if not necessarily true -- story.</p>
