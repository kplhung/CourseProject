        <p>In reaction to the rage for techno fabrics and screaming-to-be-seen styles, Andy Spade is reviving a preppy look that harks back to a simpler, less flashy time. A year ago, Mr. Spade, the husband of Kate Spade and chief executive of her accessories company, started a line of men's designs inspired by carpenters' tool bags. Called Jack Spade, they are sold at a SoHo boutique of the same name. A retired farmer from Kansas is the lone salesman at the store, which also carries Jack Spade mackintosh raincoats and retro items like Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses, vintage thermoses and Tretorn sneakers. ''Everyone I know is wearing Prada, and every magazine I pick up isn't about personal style,'' Mr. Spade complained. ''I like things that are both timeless and functional.''</p>

        <p>For a rumpled, rather than refined, look, Mr. Spade opts for Bill's Khakis, faded and frayed after four years of wear. The loose-fitting pants, with button flies, are modeled after World War II Army khakis ($80 to $95 at Upland Trading Company). He pairs them with blue button-down shirts by A.P.C. ($120 at A.P.C.). Why isn't there a Jack Spade line of sport shoes? ''I can never do a sneaker better than Tretorn,'' he said with a shrug.</p>
