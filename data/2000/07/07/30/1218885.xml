        <p>Robert McFarland, a former correspondent, producer and Washington bureau chief of NBC News, died on Tuesday at his home in Austin, Tex. He was 62.</p>
        <p>The cause was lymphoma, NBC said.</p>
        <p>Mr. McFarland spent 28 years at NBC News before retiring several years ago.</p>
        <p>He was working at an Atlanta radio station, delivering overnight newscasts, when the television network hired him to report from its Cleveland bureau in 1966.</p>
        <p>By 1969 he was a domestic producer for ''The Huntley-Brinkley Report'' in Washington. In 1973 he was put in charge of the London bureau.</p>
        <p>Returning to Washington in 1977 he was a senior producer for ''NBC Nightly News'' and, in 1982, was named vice president and bureau chief. From 1990 until his retirement four years later he was a principal planning executive at network headquarters in New York.</p>
        <p>He was born in Burnet, Tex., and graduated from Southwest Texas University in 1963. He served in the Marine Corps before making broadcast journalism his career.</p>
        <p>Mr. McFarland's survivors include his wife, Elizabeth; a daughter, Lisa Major, of Thornton, Pa.; two sons, Rob, of Austin, and Lane, of Hewitt, N.J.; and his mother, Fay McFarland, also of Austin.</p>
