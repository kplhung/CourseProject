        <p>IT'S 2 a.m., the middle of the day for Van Cliburn, who gets up when most people go to bed, and he's at the piano in his living room, playing Chopin ballades. He starts the Ballade in F minor, skips to the middle, then to the coda, nodding to show how he keeps the same tempo. He does the same with the Ballade in G minor. ''Want to hear the F major?'' he asks.</p>
        <p>Well, O.K., if he must.</p>

        <p>IT'S 2 a.m., the middle of the day for Van Cliburn, who gets up when most people go to bed, and he's at the piano in his living room, playing Chopin ballades. He starts the Ballade in F minor, skips to the middle, then to the coda, nodding to show how he keeps the same tempo. He does the same with the Ballade in G minor. ''Want to hear the F major?'' he asks.</p>
        <p>Well, O.K., if he must.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cliburn will perform Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto in B flat minor with Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony at the Tanglewood Festival in Lenox, Mass., on Friday. He gives a dozen or so concerts a year instead of the hundred he used to give, year in, year out, for 20 years, a schedule that finally wore him down.</p>
        <p>Except for gray hair and a few lines, he still looks pretty much as he did on the cover of his famous recording of the Tchaikovsky with Kirill Kondrashin and the RCA Symphony Orchestra, which was the first classical LP to sell a million copies. Americans who owned no other classical recording bought that album. That was in 1958, the year he won the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow and got a ticker-tape parade in New York. A ticker-tape parade for a classical musician. Think about that for a minute.</p>
        <p>By the way, last month America's musical golden boy turned 66. Think about that, too.</p>
        <p>I might mention that he sings while he plays the ballades. Loudly. Nicely. He has sung at church since childhood. Another reason he says he quit giving concerts for about 10 years was to give himself more time to go to the opera.</p>
        <p>''For every composer the most admired instrument is the human voice,'' he says. ''My mother would make me sight-sing before I would play any piece to cement in me the realization that striking the keys is not a digital or mechanical thing. The goal is to make a singing sound, to let the sound penetrate the air like a human voice.''</p>
        <p>His piano, a nine-foot Steinway covered with silver-framed photographs, is completely out of tune. Out of tune like a summer-camp piano during off-season. Steinway's chief technician, Ron Coners, has offered to come and tune Mr. Cliburn's piano. But Mr. Cliburn doesn't mind it the way it is. Most pianists obsess about pianos. He doesn't obsess.</p>
        <p>That he hits a few wrong notes while he plays may be taken as a sign of great generosity. He's not performing. This is a chat at the keyboard, and there's no vanity on display here. There's no vanity about Mr. Cliburn at all. He is comically modest. It's as impossible for him to speak flatteringly about himself as it is to hint at something even remotely critical about anyone else. He is charming and at the same time withholding, and this combination can make him seem vulnerable.</p>
        <p>What's most remarkable about how he plays the ballades is the sound. It's the old Cliburn sound, huge and sculptured, the bass and top voices booming out to fill a concert hall, which this living room virtually is. The room, the house, the sound, Mr. Cliburn's hands, the picture of his mother on a placard from a concert she gave that is in the next room, the view of the city that stretches out below the house, the accumulated history: everything here is Texas-scale.</p>
        <p>And fame, on this scale, is of course always a target. When his energy lagged and his playing declined in the late 1970's, before his sabbatical, the daggers came out. He couldn't handle the spotlight after all. He hadn't learned enough repertory to sustain a long-term career. He was spinning his wheels. The Tchaikovsky concerto again? An entertainer for the masses, he was talented, sure, but where would he have been without the cold war and the boyish, squeaky-clean looks and his genius impresario, Sol Hurok? With all the other good pianists in the world, Mr. Cliburn was lucky.</p>
        <p>So, for the record: he was from the start a phenomenal, natural musician, as every other pianist recognized. And prolific enough in the standard repertory. He played or recorded Beethoven's Third, Fourth and Fifth Piano Concertos, Rachmaninoff's Second and Third Concertos and Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, both Brahms concertos, both Liszt concertos, Chopin's First, MacDowell's Second, the Schumann, the Grieg, Mozart's C major (K. 503), Prokofiev's Third. Shall we go on?</p>
        <p>Standards vary. A pianist like Arturo Be nedetti Michelangeli, playing a mix of less conventional and familiar music, had a minuscule performing repertory, but that was considered a sign of his perfectionism. When he canceled concerts, people used words like ''elusive'' and ''enigma.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Cliburn always was the opposite of a shallow showboat. When other young American pianists of his generation were perfecting a midcentury style of bloodless technique, he was an instinctive, honest, ardent player of absolute control, the model of modern musicianship. Listen to the recordings. Rock-solid beat. Minimum of rubato. Moderate-to-slow tempos. Architectural solidity, which gets back to his point about the ballades.</p>
        <p>''Too much rubato is a big mistake, especially with Romantic music,'' he says. ''It's the opposite of what people assume. Rachmaninoff said that if you play a passage very evenly and more slowly than you think it should be played, then it will sound fast, and he was right. If I try to play faster than I can hear the notes, then I'm finished. You can't let the horse ride you. That's what my mother taught me, and it's what Friedheim taught her.''</p>
        <p>Arthur Friedheim is the key. Although Mr. Cliburn became known as a pupil of Rosina Lhevinne, the famous Russian pianist and Juilliard teacher, she came along late in his development. His mother, Rildia Bee O'Bryan, a gifted player, made him what he was at the keyboard before he arrived at the Juilliard School. And she, in turn, had studied with Friedheim, who studied with Anton Rubinstein and Liszt, so Mr. Cliburn is, among other things, a straight descendant of the two great figures of 19th-century pianism.</p>
        <p>Friedheim's legacy was to promote Liszt's Classicism. Friedheim played in an Apollonian style: long lines, direct expression, beautiful tone. ''Friedheim always told my mother that music has to be nearly metronomic if the lines are to be long and the effect is to be like a singer singing,'' Mr. Cliburn says. ''And so that's what my mother drilled into me.''</p>
        <p>Is it surprising that what first impressed the Russians at the Tchaikovsky Competition was how Mr. Cliburn played not Russian music but Bach and Mozart? He hardly plays them in public anymore. At Juilliard, the faculty jury for his graduation recital heard him perform Brahms's F minor Sonata and Hindemith's Third Sonata, but those works didn't make it into his concert repertory, either. Neither did Schubert's B flat Sonata or D major Sonata, which Lhevinne encouraged him to do.</p>
        <p>''When I was 18 or 19, I went through a vast amount of the piano literature,'' Mr. Cliburn says. ''But I felt if I were to have a career, I would not be a musicologist: I had no desire to play all the works of anyone. I decided what I could do well and stuck to that. I'm very realistic about myself, where I have flaws, what I really don't do well.''</p>
        <p>He adds: ''I play what I feel most comfortable with, but this doesn't mean that I am not very anxious when I perform. I am always anxious. Rarely have I ever been happy with anything I've done on stage.'' That's a curious thing to say, even considering how artists typically demur.</p>
        <p>Last year Mr. Cliburn spoke to a group of amateur pianists taking part in a competition here run by the Cliburn Foundation. (He has even less to do with that contest than with the professional one named after him, but he lends his name and talks to the players, which turns out to be plenty.) He told the amateurs that the stage is the loneliest place he knows, and he said pianists spend their lives preparing music only to walk before an audience and not have the slightest guarantee of what will happen. This may be true, but it is not exactly a love sonnet to concert life.</p>
        <p>This year's amateurs heard a fable about music besting painting among the arts because it is intangible and indestructible -- like memory, Mr. Cliburn said. At least memories last.</p>
        <p>''You hang on to a moment here or there that's acceptable,'' he said about recollecting his past performances, ''but I don't know the experience of being fully satisfied. I remember being asked to approve a live recording of the Third Rachmaninoff, which I knew had something good about it, but I couldn't stop feeling upset by the smudges. Recording makes me nervous. It's enough to deal with an audience. It was 10 years before I let the tape of the Rachmaninoff Second Sonata go.'' Which, of course, is now regarded as one of his best recordings.</p>
        <p>He describes hearing William Kapell play Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini at Lewisohn Stadium in New York in 1953, just before Kapell was killed in a plane crash. Mr. Cliburn didn't see the point even of learning the piece after that performance, declining invitations to play it for years, until Eugene Ormandy, his friend, who had conducted Rachmaninoff playing it, finally coaxed him in 1970.</p>
        <p>He did it partly to be accommodating. That has been his problem sometimes. When people have clamored to hear him play what he is already famous for, he has. Critics who have heard the Tchaikovsky concerto over and over again may be bored by it, but most people rarely hear it live and will get to hear Mr. Cliburn play it live only once. And he has known that.</p>
        <p>IT'S nearly 4 a.m. now, and he is on the sofa, reminiscing, which can be an uncontrollable phenomenon. Ask him why, after winning in Moscow, he went to study with Bruno Walter and he recalls playing the Prokofiev Third on Dimitri Mitropoulos's piano, then describes what he calls an unremarkable conducting stint in 1963. And the stories, although familiar, are to say the least exceptional, but it's not clear by the end exactly what he learned from Walter.</p>
        <p>Or what he learned from Rosina Lhevinne, which is another question put to him: ''One of the things I distinctly remember was being a little early for a lesson and she was playing, and I opened the double doors to the studio and heard her play Chopin's 'Aeolian Harp' Etude -- oh my, as if from heaven!'' Yes, but about the lessons? ''Well, I remember she wanted tempi faster sometimes.''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Cliburn gives the impression of being utterly content now and not too inclined to excavate the past afresh. He lets on at one point, as if revealing a deep family secret, that he's thinking about performing Bach again, the E minor Partita, maybe, and he floats a program for a scheduled Chopin recital in Boston that is so preposterously long that it sounds like a fantasy of a young pianist in the first flush of success -- as if, no matter how stressful the stage may have been all those years, it is still the locus of his imagination.</p>
        <p>How much is enough for a career? Only he has the right to say, of course. His place in history is reserved. Mr. Cliburn, who spent years living out of a suitcase in hotels, a born performer but a private man, having made several landmark albums, now plays when he wants, if not always at the level he did when he was young and playing all the time. He lives in a real house, cooks for pleasure, socializes, does nothing if he feels like it, goes to the opera, travels constantly without obligations.</p>
        <p>Among the mementos on the piano is a snapshot of Vladimir Ashkenazy, the pianist, who once said: ''Van is what he is; he is not pretending to be anything else. And there are not so many people in the world, especially in the artistic world, who are just as they are.''</p>
