        <p>There are about 100 billion galaxies in the universe, each with about 100 billion stars. It would take 10,000 years to tally them if every human being on earth counted them at the rate of five per second. Sounds crowded out there, right? Yet if the solar system were the size of a coffee cup, the Milky Way would be as big as North America. And if you could collapse the Milky Way into that cup, the nearest sizable galaxy, Andromeda, would drift in space about seven feet away. Here's the capper: there is less than one atom per cubic yard floating in intergalactic space, while on earth one cubic yard of air holds about 50 trillion trillion atoms. These are among the mind-blowing revelations in ONE UNIVERSE: At Home in the Cosmos (Joseph Henry/National Academy Press, $40), an insightful primer on all things great and small. Loosely organized around the three basic principles driving the universe -- motion, matter and energy -- the book features crisp, rarely patronizing writing to describe the current state of knowledge of everything from the tiniest subatomic particles (with exotic names like fermions, bosons and leptoquarks) to superstring theory and other ''grand unified theories'' that seek to meld cosmic forces with the principles of quantum mechanics. The authors (Neil de Grasse Tyson, the director of the Hayden Planetarium, Charles Liu, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History, and Robert Irion, a science journalist) employ everyday analogies to explain the four basic forces of nature -- gravity, electromagnetism and the ''strong'' and ''weak'' forces at play in an atom's nucleus -- and the many fascinating ways these building blocks manifest themselves and interact. There are many helpful illustrations and color photographs, notably a riveting two-page photo showing a long string of burning fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 being pulled to the roiling surface of Jupiter. What's most refreshing about this road trip through the heavens is the humility of its authors in the face of so much that is unknowable or dimly understood, even as they patiently but eloquently provide one-stop shopping for students of the cosmos.</p>
