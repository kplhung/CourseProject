        <p>Unlike Mr. Fulks, Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn, are good ol' boys who don't rock the boat. But they certainly rock the house.</p>
        <p>The most successful duo in country music history, Brooks and Dunn have taken hard-edged cowboy music to new commercial heights thanks to fiery vocals, first-rate rock musicianship and country-boy soul.</p>
        <p>Their career began in 1990 with the release of the No. 1 ''Brand New Man,'' but in 1992, they reached stardom with their biggest record to date, ''Boot Scootin' Boogie.'' Their latest album (their sixth), ''Tightrope,'' was released last year. When they play the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel at 7: 30 p.m. Friday, expect to hear material from this eclectic offering, including ''Goin' Under Gettin' Over You,'' featuring a gorgeous vocal by Ronnie Dunn, a pithy remake of John Waite's ''Missing You,'' and ''Beer Thirty'' for the Jersey honky tonkers.</p>
