        <p>After being closed off and on for the last three years for renovation, the Washington Monument is to reopen to visitors tomorrow, missing its Fourth of July goal by four weeks.</p>
        <p>The 555-foot obelisk, a symbol of the man and the city since it opened in 1888, was covered for much of its renovation by a scaffolding designed by the architect Michael Graves that mimicked its stonework and provided a means for workers to repoint joints and repair chipped stones.</p>

        <p>After being closed off and on for the last three years for renovation, the Washington Monument is to reopen to visitors tomorrow, missing its Fourth of July goal by four weeks.</p>
        <p>The 555-foot obelisk, a symbol of the man and the city since it opened in 1888, was covered for much of its renovation by a scaffolding designed by the architect Michael Graves that mimicked its stonework and provided a means for workers to repoint joints and repair chipped stones.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graves also worked on the interior, which is roomier and brighter than before. Its observation windows at the 500-foot level, which provide a bird's-eye view of Washington, have been widened by an inch in a repair intended to make them watertight. The windows are now 32 3/4 inches wide.</p>
        <p>The renovation cost $10 million, of which $2.5 million was donated by Target Stores.  The monument will be open free every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
