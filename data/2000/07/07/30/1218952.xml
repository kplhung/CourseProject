        <p>In Britain, mad cow disease is scarier than ever. Fourteen people have died of it already this year and five more are dying, compared to 14 in all of last year. Experts say the rising death toll might presage an even higher death rate.</p>
        <p>So the United States Department of Agriculture is acting zealously to combat any chance of mad cow disease entering the country. It has condemned two flocks of imported Belgian dairy sheep because four sheep related to the 355 animals tested positive for an undetermined disease in the mad cow family. Fighting back in federal court, the owners of the sheep have challenged the science behind the tests.</p>
