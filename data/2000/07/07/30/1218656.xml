        <p>Like the widow's walk on the homes of yesteryear's fishermen, the potato barn, a relic of such hardscrabble republican virtues as agrarian self-reliance, still casts a spell over North Fork old-timers.</p>
        <p>The physical appeal of certain wineries, notably built-from-the-ground-up Palmer and funky Lenz, expresses the feel and charm of the old barns. And, smartly, so do the labels of Schneider Vineyards' second wine, Potato Barn White and Potato Barn Red.</p>
        <p>In capturing pictorially the effects of weathered wood, Bruce Schneider and Christiane Baker Schneider, both in their early 30's and both studiously image-conscious in marketing practices, turn the past to profitable modern use.</p>
        <p>Vintage New York, New York City's first store devoted exclusively to New York wines, which opened in SoHo on Monday, chose the '98 Potato Barn Red as one of its initial 125 selections.</p>
        <p>A blend of 63 percent cabernet franc, the Schneider's favorite red grape, and 37 percent merlot, the ruby-colored wine is densely aromatic and assertively grapey, with a kind of Emeril Lagasse ''Bam!'' Opaque, sturdy, earthy, expansive and long, with cassis notes (and, a minor defect, bell pepper), the wine has a crowd-pleasing Bordeaux tilt.</p>
        <p>The pretty '98 Potato Barn White, 85 percent chardonnay and 15 percent pinot blanc, occupies the cutting edge of food-oriented East End lightness. Its fruit-salad aroma gives way to an entirely agreeable, creamy, zingy drink with a slightly dry-pineapple flavor.</p>
        <p>These are the Schneiders' No. 2 wines. Many New York producers would be happy to claim them as their own No. 1's.</p>
        <p>These small-production wines come from purchased East End fruit. Bedell produced and bottled the red (around $15); Palmer, the white (around $13.50).</p>
        <p>In February, the Schneiders bought a 22-acre potato farm in Riverhead to convert into a vineyard and winery. They plan to make cabernet franc their centerpiece.</p>
