        <p>IT happened decades ago, but Sarah Jessica Parker well remembers a horribly embarrassing experience. In the third grade at the Clifton School in Cincinnati, her teacher called out her name and she had to go to the front of the line each day to get a ticket for her free lunch from the state.</p>
        <p>''We were on welfare,'' recalled Ms. Parker, the curly-haired, slinky star and producer of H.B.O.'s ''Sex and the City.''</p>
        <p>''I knew I was different from the kids who pay for lunch or bring their lunch from home. It was a stigma thing. I was not the only person receiving a free lunch, but you are aware.''</p>
        <p>''I remember my childhood as Dickensian,'' she added. ''I remember being poor. There was no great way to hide it. We didn't have electricity sometimes. We didn't have Christmases sometimes, or we didn't have birthdays sometimes, or the bill collectors came, or the phone company would call and say, 'We're shutting your phones off.' And we were all old enough to either get the calls, or watch my mother's reactions or watch my parents shuffling the money around.''</p>
        <p>''We'' included Ms. Parker's three older and four younger siblings. Neither her father, Stephen Parker, then a writer, nor her stepfather, Paul Forste, a truck driver whom her mother, Barbara, married when Sarah Jessica was 3 1/2, earned enough to support such a large family.</p>
        <p>Ms. Parker has a matter-of-fact tone as she talks of the past; there is no trace of bitterness. She remembers much about her childhood warmly and remains extremely close to her siblings and her parents. But when it comes to money, her harsh childhood experiences continue to shape her attitudes, making her a conservative investor.</p>
        <p>''The thing I want most for my children -- I would like for them to not be aware of money, which means I have been very aware of my financial situation,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Those children -- she is planning to have some of her own someday soon --  shouldn't have to worry. Today Sarah Jessica Parker is one of the hottest stars on television. With her megawatt smile plastered on buses and pay phones across the country, she draws as much attention as Hollywood icons like Julia Roberts.</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Parker, 35, has been in show business most of her life and has many film, stage and television credits, the success of the two-year-old ''Sex and the City'' has catapulted her into a whole new financial category. Industry executives estimate that her pay -- while still nowhere near as high as for some stars on regular network television -- is now $100,000 to $150,000 an episode.</p>
        <p>Her husband, Matthew Broderick, is a highly regarded Hollywood and Broadway actor, but Ms. Parker does not want to depend on him financially. They keep their monetary affairs separate.</p>
        <p>Ms. Parker says her father once told her that to assure her financial security, she needed $8 million. Though she would not be more specific, given her salary from the H.B.O. series and films, she seems likely to be more than halfway there.</p>
        <p>''What has happened in the past year is extraordinary,'' she said happily. ''There is not a day that passes that I am not grateful for the windfall.''</p>
        <p>With that capital and earning power, her life is a far cry from the days when her mother used to buy her and her sisters each two pairs of shoes a year and dresses at 99 cents each. ''There was a corporate outlet and you could get Polly Flinders dresses really inexpensively,'' said Mrs. Forste, who now lives in Teaneck, N.J.,  and teaches nursery school, a career that she had dropped when Sarah Jessica was 3. ''It was not unusual to get them there or at rummage sales.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Parker says she invests conservatively and worries about the day when she cannot get work. But her scary financial past and her current flush state sometimes make for an odd couple.</p>
        <p>''That is why I have such a weird relationship with money,'' Ms. Parker said. ''And it is why I can be profligate and super-frugal. And I think it is rather warped since it comes from this desire to save, save, save. And on the other hand, I have been working so hard for 25 years -- why can't I have another pair of Manolo Blahnik shoes or that bag that I love?''</p>
        <p>She shoots ''Sex in the City'' for  about six months out of the year and a feature film during the hiatus.  ''Whatever happens to the stock market, I am making a steady paycheck every week'' while the series is in production, she said, ''so the tote board gets bigger, and there is more to spend.''</p>
        <p>Still, when she is doing a movie and is on location, she receives a living allowance in cash each week. That is when she is most tempted to splurge.</p>
        <p>''They hand you the cash and it's like pop candy,'' Ms. Parker said. ''In the good old days, they used to call it 'mad money.' '' A recent acquisition, she said, was a second Hermes bag; her husband had bought her the first as a gift.</p>
        <p>But when she is not working, she is nervous about spending. ''Idle hands are the devil's workshop,'' she intoned.</p>
        <p>''My friends know me so well, and they know how terrified I am of being broke, and they think it is hilarious and humorous,'' she added.</p>
        <p>MS. PARKER'S fears, however, have considerable basis in her industry. History is rife with stories of actresses who never got much work after the age of 45, and Ms. Parker is clearly aware of the odds of surviving in the business.</p>
        <p>''In the case of the entertainment industry, actresses have this window, and the window closes every day a little bit more,'' she said. ''The earnings potential falls and the window is closed, and I am really cognizant of that. I have no illusions of who I am or what I look like or what I have to offer.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Parker caught the acting bug early. Her mother was infatuated with the arts, particularly the theater. ''I would like to say that I was absolutely not a stage mother,'' Mrs. Forste said. ''But on some level I was. What the children did was pretty much under our control. But any of the kids that did not want to act didn't do it.''</p>
        <p>Sarah Jessica, who began acting professionally when she was 8, was one of several clan members who loved it. Two of her brothers -- Pippin Parker, a writer, and Timothy Britten Parker, an actor -- are also  in the business.</p>
        <p>An early career breakthrough for Sarah Jessica came in 1979, at the age of 14, when she played the lead in the Broadway production of ''Annie.''</p>
        <p>''It was away from all the chaos of the house,'' Ms. Parker said. ''It was this really structured environment. And the theater seemed really nice and disciplined. And they paid me, and I didn't have any money.''</p>
        <p>Her credits range from television's ''Square Pegs'' and ''Year in the Life'' to the films ''Footloose'' (1984), ''L.A. Story'' (1991), ''Ed Wood'' (1994) ''Honeymoon in Vegas'' (1992) and ''The First Wives' Club'' (1996). On stage, she has been seen in ''Substance of Fire'' and the Broadway revivals of ''How to Succeed in Business,'' opposite Mr. Broderick, and ''Once Upon a Mattress,'' in which she starred as the Princess.</p>
        <p>IN SHOW business, the big money is made in movies, and until now Ms. Parker has never commanded headline-grabbing fees. That was partly because she has turned down some higher-paying roles. ''I have  never been a big payday person,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''The First Wives Club'' had the highest box-office receipts of any of her movies, but it was not until she played Nell in ''Dudley Do-Right,''  filmed in 1999, after ''Sex and the City'' had made her a television star, that she could command more than  $500,000 for a lead movie role, one industry expert said.</p>
        <p>''It is the choices you make,'' Miss Parker said.</p>
        <p>Today, with her celebrity status soaring, she would probably get $1 million or more, several leading agents said.</p>
        <p>Most of Ms. Parker's paychecks are invested pretty conservatively  by firms selected by Frank Selvaggi, a founder of Altman, Greenfield &amp; Selvaggi, an accounting firm in Midtown Manhattan that advises many entertainers. Ms. Parker's stepfather, who started his own trucking company in the early 1980's, introduced her to Mr. Selvaggi 18 years ago. They have worked together ever since.</p>
        <p>She relies heavily on Mr. Selvaggi's advice, which goes well beyond the selection of money managers. His firm pays her bills, and Mr. Selvaggi, in concert with her agent, Kevin Houvane at Creative Artists, occasionally counsels her on whether she needs to accept an offer for film or television work. When a commercial is offered, for example, ''he might tell me not to do it,'' Ms. Parker said.</p>
        <p>''He'll say: 'Be true to yourself. You don't need the money,' '' she added.</p>
        <p>Ms. Parker has been working 14-hour days lately on ''Sex and the City,'' leaving her little time for worrying about finances. But she checks in regularly.</p>
        <p>''She is more active than most people,'' Mr. Selvaggi said. ''She calls me every month to go over her bills and financial statements. Not that she asks about individual stocks, but if there are big swings, she brings it up.''</p>
        <p>In 1995, Ms. Parker bought an apartment in the TriBeCa neighborhood of Manhattan. In 1997, the year she married Mr. Broderick, she sold it to move in with him and started putting her extra capital to work.</p>
        <p>Today, 30 percent to 40 percent of her investment portfolio is in tax-free bonds. The remainder is in various stocks and mutual funds primarily handled by McDonald &amp; Company and other investment firms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Selvaggi and McDonald executives tailored her investment strategy. ''I sat in a long meeting and listened and looked at a lot of numbers and pies and graphs and made those conservative choices,'' Ms.  Parker said.</p>
        <p>Generally, Mr. Selvaggi said, the investments are in value stocks like Colgate-Palmolive and Citigroup. He has stayed away from dot-coms because the approach he has worked out with Ms. Parker has been, as he put it, that ''slow and steady wins the race.''</p>
        <p>They put some money into blue-chip technology stocks including Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Intel, in 1997 and 1998, he said but not too much, because ''when she was going into the market, it was very high and shaky.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Selvaggi said Ms. Parker's stock investments have done very well, beating the 19.5 percent gain of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index last year.</p>
        <p>Although some investors think stocks are just as safe an investment as bonds over the long term, and much better than bonds at making money, Mr. Selvaggi is mindful that a performer's career can suddenly spiral downward.</p>
        <p>''Bonds are less volatile,'' he said.  ''And sometimes you are talking about a two-  or three-year window when the market is on a downward slope, but people need capital. If they invest in the stock market, the capital can drop in value. I make sure they understand the risk.''</p>
        <p>LIKE many other people these days, Ms. Parker is torn about her investing style. ''There's a guy on the show who made his mortgage in one day on his house on some Internet stock,'' she said. ''I said to him: 'Why didn't you call me?' He made $35,000 in half an hour, which I think is a great gig. I don't do any of that stuff. I watch the market, and Matthew and I have these conversations like, 'Should we get out?' And I call Frank, and it is so scary, and he says: 'It's O.K. Stay in.' ''</p>
        <p>She knows she has missed out on some of the stock market's big gains in recent years, ''but I feel like it's too late to catch up,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''It's as if you haven't written somebody a thank-you note in months,'' she added. ''You can't begin to do it so late.''</p>
        <p>She is not impervious to stock tips. In 1992, when she was working in Pittsburgh, the hub of U S Air Group, now U S Airways, she took a shot. ''The guy who did my hair had a boyfriend who worked at U S Air. He's like: 'It's going to merge with British Air. Get in there.' I called Frank at 6 in the morning and said, 'Buy U S Air.' '' She invested about $2,500.</p>
        <p>This year, when U S Airways agreed to be acquired, albeit by the UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, Ms. Parker sold and made $4,000. About that time, she made her only other independent financial choice, a $10,000 investment in a restaurant that went out of business.</p>
        <p>She and her husband have stayed with the separate financial advisers they had before they met, she said, and ''we don't discuss money very much.''</p>
        <p>''I have a rough understanding of what Matthew can and cannot afford, but there is no reason I need to know how much money he has,'' she added. ''If and when we have our children, then things become communal.</p>
        <p>''Men, especially, say to me: 'You are loaded,' and I say: 'Matthew's money is not my money.' I have to work. I never want Matthew to feel the pressure to take a job because he thinks he has to support me.</p>
        <p>''If I asked him about his finances, he would tell me. But I don't want to know. It is not what keeps me interested in him. I suppose that if Matthew told me that he wouldn't tell me, I would feel resentful. But it is the least important thing, because Matthew has always said that he would take care of me. And I would take care of him.''</p>
        <p>The couple do not have a joint checking account. ''I buy all the groceries and his clothes and pay for reupholstering the furniture,'' she said. ''We take each other out to dinner. We do have a joint credit card and sometimes use it for groceries.'' Mr. Broderick pays it.</p>
        <p>She and her husband live in a Federal-style 1840's brownstone in Greenwich Village that Mr. Broderick bought before they were married. They rent an old farmhouse in the Hamptons for the summer and, as Mr. Selvaggi put it, can afford do what they like.</p>
        <p>IF THEY don't talk about how to make money, they do talk about how to spend it. ''I bought cheap because that is what my mother did,'' Ms. Parker said. ''She would drive 15 miles out of her way to get 15 bags of paper towels because they were cheaper.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Broderick is more prone to ''buy one good knife and then you don't have to keep replacing it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She says that her husband is very smart about money and that she has learned from him. At the most practical level, she said, she would no longer ''buy a used car and keep replacing it over and over; I would buy one decent car.''</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Parker has loosened up a bit with money, she remains determined not to repeat her family's financial past.</p>
        <p>When Sarah Jessica was 11, the family moved from Cincinnati to  Roosevelt Island in New York City -- then a new mixed-income community on a piece of land formerly named Welfare Island -- so the children could do more work in the theater.</p>
        <p>''There was a sort of a caste system,'' she recalled. ''It was a sliding scale with some subsidized housing.'' The families with the least money lived in the less desirable apartments. ''We were in the house closest to the parking lot, and so everybody knew,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The pressure eased as Mr. Forste's business did better and the children grew up.</p>
        <p>Ms. Parker is ambivalent about the stresses of earning money as a child in a family that needed it so desperately. In those days in New York State, there was no legislation requiring that some of a child actor's earnings go directly into a trust. Nor were there laws saying how much a child actor could work.</p>
        <p>Much of the money the children earned ''was absorbed into the family,'' Ms. Parker said. ''I wouldn't deny anything that I contributed financially.''</p>
        <p>But, she said, ''if I knew then what I know now, I would have had somebody outside the family help me manage the money -- an objective party that would keep things real clean, so that when you were a teenager, you don't feel resentful that you can't at least keep some of it.''</p>
        <p>In retrospect, she can laugh at the trials of growing up under such stress and at the complex standards her mother had about what her children could and could not do.</p>
        <p>''She would never let me work in television,'' Ms. Parker recalled. ''She thought it was vulgar and trashy.''</p>
        <p>For her mother, ''the theater and ballet were not about money,'' Ms. Parker said. ''It was about this grand idea of who we were as a family.''</p>
        <p>''Her role model was Rose Kennedy,'' Ms. Parker added. ''She wanted to raise a family that had grand and important lives. It was weird because we were living in all this chaos, but her image was actually a great motivator.''</p>
