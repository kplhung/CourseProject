        <p>School officials in Rye cannot be held liable for a 1996 incident in which a high school sophomore was blinded in his left eye while roughhousing with a classmate, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court has ruled. In a unanimous decision based on an opinion written by Justice Howard Miller, the four-member panel dismissed the high school, the city school district and the board of education from the case. But Lawrence T. D'Aloise Jr., a lawyer for the family of the injured student, Ian Convey, said he will pursue a suit against the family of Peter Lauria, the other boy involved. The students were throwing seed pods or pine cones at each other on the school's front lawn for less than a minute before the injury occurred. ''Absent some extraordinary security and supervision it is unavoidable horseplay that occurs on every playground in every suburban school yard in this country,'' said Joseph J. Andriola, a lawyer for the Laurias. ''We think it is a defensible case.''</p>
