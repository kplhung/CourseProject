        <p>Parking lots in Manhattan are useful for drivers, of course, but their real value is as development sites.</p>
        <p>This was underscored recently when a 17,500-square-foot lot in Chelsea, which had been purchased for $5 million in 1998, was sold for $13 million to the El Ad Group of Israeli investors.</p>
        <p>The through-the-block site, at 147 West 17th Street and 160-64 West 18th Street, between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, is to be used for residential development.</p>
        <p>Recent zoning changes have enhanced the value of building sites in the area, said Anne DeMarzo, the president of DeMarzo Realty, which was the broker for both transactions. The changes ''played a significant role in the increase in the value of the property,'' she said. ''Parking lots in the area became hot properties,'' she added, ''and developers have been moving to snap them up.''</p>
        <p>The developers are planning to build a 120,000-square-foot condominium with 137 apartments. A basement parking garage will be included, and a special permit has been filed for 74 parking spaces.</p>
        <p>City officials in the past have tried to reduce traffic congestion by limiting the amount of parking in residential buildings to one space for every five apartments, but they have recently said they were considering liberalizing those rules.</p>
