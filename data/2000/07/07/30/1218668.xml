        <p>THERE are few musicians alive who can do justice to a Charlie Parker celebration better than the saxophonist James Moody. That's why he's anchoring the Caramoor Jazz Festival  next Saturday at the Venetian Theater at Caramoor in Katonah. ''Charlie Parker was my ideal,'' said Mr. Moody, who will perform with his quartet, including Phil Woods, Charles McPherson and Jon Faddis. ''When he and Dizzy hit it, that was it for me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moody was referring to Dizzy Gillespie, who pioneered the bebop style in the late 1940's with Mr. Parker. Mr. Moody, who played alongside Mr. Gillespie from 1946 until his death in 1993, was there when audiences crowded the clubs on  52nd Street in Manhattan to see the evolution of jazz. Of all the talented musicians performing at this year's festival, Mr. Moody is the only one who played with Bird, as Mr. Parker was known.</p>

        <p>THERE are few musicians alive who can do justice to a Charlie Parker celebration better than the saxophonist James Moody. That's why he's anchoring the Caramoor Jazz Festival  next Saturday at the Venetian Theater at Caramoor in Katonah. ''Charlie Parker was my ideal,'' said Mr. Moody, who will perform with his quartet, including Phil Woods, Charles McPherson and Jon Faddis. ''When he and Dizzy hit it, that was it for me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moody was referring to Dizzy Gillespie, who pioneered the bebop style in the late 1940's with Mr. Parker. Mr. Moody, who played alongside Mr. Gillespie from 1946 until his death in 1993, was there when audiences crowded the clubs on  52nd Street in Manhattan to see the evolution of jazz. Of all the talented musicians performing at this year's festival, Mr. Moody is the only one who played with Bird, as Mr. Parker was known.</p>
        <p>On Saturday the festival celebrates what would have been Mr. Parker's 80th birthday with Sam River's Trio, which starts things off at 2 p.m. The Hilton Ruiz Trio with Chris Potter, the Steve Lacy and Mal Waldron and Paul Motian, Joe Lovano and Bill Frisell continue up to the 6:45 p.m. dinner break. The James Moody Quartet closes the tribute with an 8 p.m. concert.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moody, who was born 75 years ago in Savannah, Ga., and raised in Newark, N.J., didn't take up the alto sax until he was 16. He played in a band while in the Air Force and met Mr. Gillespie in Greensboro, N.C., where Mr. Gillespie was performing. After his discharge later that year, Mr. Moody joined Mr. Gillespie in New York in a band that included Thelonious Monk, Milt Jackson and Miles Davis.</p>
        <p>In 1949 Mr. Moody moved to Europe, where he remained until 1952. His intention was to stay with relatives while dealing with problems  with alcohol and Benzedrine. He stayed because of the vivacious jazz scene throughout Europe. ''I had no intention of returning because of the prejudice back home,'' Mr. Moody said. ''I came back because 'Moody's Mood' was a hit.''</p>
        <p>''Moody's Mood for Love,'' which was recorded in Sweden, was Mr. Moody's improvisation on ''I'm in the Mood for Love.'' It became his signature song.</p>
        <p>After his return, Mr. Moody performed and recorded with several jazz and pop musicians. His latest recording is ''Moody Plays Mancini'' (Warner Bros.), which shows off Mr. Moody on all of his horns and theflute. He also landed his first-ever acting role, appearing in Clint Eastwood's film adaptation of the longtime best seller ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.''</p>
        <p>Just as Mr. Gillespie taught Mr. Moody invaluable lessons more than 50 years ago, Mr. Moody teaches aspiring jazz musicians through clinics. Mr. Moody said that young musicians have the advantage of quality jazz programs in several colleges and universities. That alone, however, isn't the key to success.</p>
        <p>''The thing is, anyone can make it in music if they really want it,'' said Mr. Moody, who is a Baha'i and considers music a spiritual experience. ''When I was young, all I thought about was playing saxophone. If someone really wants to do something, God will provide.''</p>
        <p>The James Moody Quartet performs at 8 p.m. next Saturday at the Caramoor Jazz Festival. Tickets are $40. The box office number is (914) 232-1252, and the Web site is www.caramoor.com.</p>
