        <p>ON the heels of time-savers like self-serve supermarket checkouts -- or keychains that let you pay for gasoline at the pump -- comes Robovideo, a 24-hour video rental store in Encino, Calif., with 1,000 available videos, 630 members and no staff.</p>
        <p>The co-owners and sole employees are Les Butler of Los Angeles and Laurent Sebban, originally of Toulon, France. They created Robovideo by adopting a 10-year-old European model for automated video stores. For now, there is only one Robovideo site, but Mr. Butler would like to expand by franchising.</p>

        <p>ON the heels of time-savers like self-serve supermarket checkouts -- or keychains that let you pay for gasoline at the pump -- comes Robovideo, a 24-hour video rental store in Encino, Calif., with 1,000 available videos, 630 members and no staff.</p>
        <p>The co-owners and sole employees are Les Butler of Los Angeles and Laurent Sebban, originally of Toulon, France. They created Robovideo by adopting a 10-year-old European model for automated video stores. For now, there is only one Robovideo site, but Mr. Butler would like to expand by franchising.</p>
        <p>A swipe of the membership card unlocks the door of the store, in much the same way that an A.T.M. card gets you into a bank lobby after closing time. ''Once you get your card, you come and go as you please.'' Mr. Butler said. ''It's like having your own key.''</p>
        <p>Inside the store, a customer inserts the card into a computer called the Selector, enters a personal identification number and chooses a movie. The computer deducts the rental price ($1.75 for six hours to $2.75 for a day) from the customer's prepaid account balance; at parents' request, it can even screen out films that may be unsuitable for children.</p>
        <p>The transaction is completed by placing the card in the Distributor, a machine that retrieves the video. Tapes arrive one at a time through a small door, in generic plastic sleeves.</p>
        <p>Robovideo offers services similar to those of traditional rental stores, but without the wait, Mr. Butler said. ''Customer service in larger chains these days is pretty minimal anyway,'' he said. ''You are left to yourself to get your movie and pay for it. You don't have to deal with lines, wandering around and dealing with a cashier who maybe doesn't know what's going on.''</p>
