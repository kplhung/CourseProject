        <p>AS Claudia Jean (C. J.) Cregg, the press secretary on ''The West Wing,'' Allison Janney maintains the poise of a Noel Coward heroine in the face of constant crisis. Her elegance is outsize, like everything else about her -- the fully 6-foot frame; the long, expressive arms; the wide, ringed eyes; the sparkling burgundy voice. Her elongated face can darken with anxiety or crack open in a broad, raucous laugh. And since she holds her head high as she moves through the White House, she often seems to be floating.</p>
        <p>In one episode, President Josiah Bartlet (Martin Sheen) describes C. J. as ''like a 50's movie star -- so capable, so loving and energetic.'' A more precise analogy would be to a 30's or early-40's star. Delivering the high-speed banter written by the series' creator, Aaron Sorkin, Ms. Janney is a throwback to the Rosalind Russell of ''His Girl Friday'' and ''No Time for Comedy,'' while her C. J., wised up but with a core of vulnerability, recalls the roles that used to be written for Jean Arthur.</p>

        <p>AS Claudia Jean (C. J.) Cregg, the press secretary on ''The West Wing,'' Allison Janney maintains the poise of a Noel Coward heroine in the face of constant crisis. Her elegance is outsize, like everything else about her -- the fully 6-foot frame; the long, expressive arms; the wide, ringed eyes; the sparkling burgundy voice. Her elongated face can darken with anxiety or crack open in a broad, raucous laugh. And since she holds her head high as she moves through the White House, she often seems to be floating.</p>
        <p>In one episode, President Josiah Bartlet (Martin Sheen) describes C. J. as ''like a 50's movie star -- so capable, so loving and energetic.'' A more precise analogy would be to a 30's or early-40's star. Delivering the high-speed banter written by the series' creator, Aaron Sorkin, Ms. Janney is a throwback to the Rosalind Russell of ''His Girl Friday'' and ''No Time for Comedy,'' while her C. J., wised up but with a core of vulnerability, recalls the roles that used to be written for Jean Arthur.</p>
        <p>At 39, Ms. Janney is a celebrity for the first time; she is also an Emmy nominee for best supporting actress, alongside her co-star Stockard Channing (who has a recurring role as the First Lady). ''I think I'm just a late bloomer,'' Ms. Janney admitted over lunch in New York, her home when she isn't shooting ''The West Wing'' on the West Coast. ''I've done so many weird things -- was in so many failed theater companies, trying to get started. It's always taken me a while.'' In fact, Ms. Janney, who grew up in Dayton, Ohio, has been acting since her Kenyon College undergraduate days, when the Kenyon alumnus Paul Newman cast her in a show. She went on to train at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. And she has been clearly visible -- onstage, on television, in movies -- for most of the last decade, producing work that qualifies her as one of the finest character actors in the country.</p>
        <p>''Law and Order'' aficionados will remember her in Michael Moriarty's valedictory episode, in which, as a woman forced to testify against a gangster, she played a harrowing scene on the stand, aware that to give evidence was to sign her own death warrant. Manhattan theatergoers have seen her opposite Frank Langella in Coward's ''Present Laughter,'' as Katharine in ''The Taming of the Shrew'' and in a Tony-nominated performance in Arthur Miller's ''View From the Bridge.'' And she has had vivid supporting roles in a variety of movies. As a manic fashion editor in ''Six Days, Seven Nights,'' she swung her arms around like giant pointers and executed vocal dips that suggested rocks tossed in a lake; it was a masterly job of caricature. She was the librarian who had a one-night stand with John Travolta in ''Primary Colors,'' the high school guidance counselor formulating a romance novel on her laptop in ''10 Things I Hate About You'' and the depressed wife of the Marine played by Chris Cooper in ''American Beauty'' -- a role that, in a handful of scenes and perhaps half a dozen lines, she managed to fill with a complete inner life. And her portrait of Loretta, the trailer-camp neighbor who plays substitute mom to the beauty contestant Kirsten Dunst in last summer's ''Drop Dead Gorgeous,'' was so winning that the director, Michael Patrick Jann, expanded the role on the set.</p>
        <p>''This woman is a great actress,'' Mr. Jann said emphatically. ''She can play the trashy aspect of a woman like this and not make her awful. She embodied the whole spirit of the movie.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Janney said: ''I think that no matter what style I'm working in, it's always rooted in some kind of real truth, something that allows me to be human, even if I'm in a beehive hairdo and tight pants and a leopard bra,'' as she was in ''Drop Dead Gorgeous.'' The human touch that grounds her portrayal of C. J. Cregg on ''The West Wing'' is the insecurity beneath her efficient, assured air. ''She's really good at what she does,'' Ms. Janney continued, ''and she tries really hard, and yet she's terrified that she'll screw up, because it's twice as hard for a woman in this man's world, especially in the White House.''</p>
        <p>VIEWERS have seen C. J. struggle with the fact that her male colleagues don't always treat her as an equal. In one episode, she was kept in the dark about an act of aggression India committed against Pakistan, and she felt that her ignorance made her look stupid when she had to field questions. In another, the chief of staff, Leo McGarry (John Spencer), failed to relay to the president her forecast -- the single optimistic one -- that Bartlet's administration would score significantly higher in the latest poll, and she turned out to be right. In these skirmishes, C. J. fights to have her point of view respected by her co-workers, while Ms. Janney lets us see how difficult it is for C. J. to keep putting herself forward in this way, and how much it costs her emotionally. Her actor's instinct to play opposite impulses against each other enhances an already skillfully articulated role. It's no wonder that Mr. Sorkin said of her, ''I can't count the number of times she's saved me by making a moment or a scene interesting that wasn't on paper when I wrote it.''</p>
        <p>''If you're a writer,'' Mr. Sorkin added, ''you hoard the actors you find whom you really want to go into war with -- actors who are solid and sure, who have a great facility with language and humor, who don't feel the need to play smart but who are smart and walk around with that confidence. Allison is whip-smart, as funny a woman as I've ever met, and what you never see coming is how sexy she is.''</p>
        <p>Viewers of ''The West Wing'' have had the opportunity to see that sexiness in Ms. Janney's scenes with Timothy Busfield as the reporter Danny Concannon, whose burgeoning relationship with C. J. contains all the elements of a classic romantic-comedy tangle, including moments when their jobs place them in an adversarial position. And in one episode, C. J. sang a karaoke version of ''The Jackal'' by Ronny Jordan in which, typically for this character, she countered the sleek seductiveness of her performance by commenting mockingly on it. That interlude came out of an off-camera improvisation. ''I was goofing around in my trailer,'' Ms. Janney said. ''You spend so many hours in your trailer with nothing to do. That time could be productive, but I choose to learn the words to songs and dance around like an idiot. And I'd make Richard Schiff'' -- who plays the communications director, Toby Ziegler -- ''come in and play all the air instruments. We did it for Aaron one night, and the next thing I knew, it was in the script.''</p>
        <p>In the episode, C. J.'s ''Jackal'' is already legendary among her colleagues. It's such a party favorite that when a co-worker tries to start a conversation with Toby during her rendition, Toby replies incredulously, ''You're talking to me during 'The Jackal'?'' Fans of the show have responded in kind: among male viewers especially, this hour of ''The West Wing'' has become known as the '' 'Jackal' episode.''</p>
        <p>The quality of Ms. Janney's work has earned her the loyalty of her directors: Scott Elliott, who directed her in ''Present Laughter,'' swore, ''I'd cast her in everything if I could.'' And it has won her the admiration of her fellow actors. ''When Allison is shooting, you usually see a big crowd around the monitors watching,'' Mr. Sorkin said. ''She's an actress everyone in the show wants to play scenes with.'' She's critical of her own work, however. ''I feel very inconsistent in my acting,'' she said. ''The most important lesson I learned about acting was from my college professor, Tom Turgeon, who told me, 'You need to listen more.' It's so much more fun to do it that way -- to really listen to the person you're acting with. So it's different every night, and sometimes that's frustrating emotionally. When I was doing 'A View From the Bridge' I would have to spend at least half an hour preparing each night, and sometimes I needed more time and I didn't have it.''</p>
        <p>On ''The West Wing,'' she often has to memorize a scene and then go directly on camera. ''You don't get to rehearse that banter,'' she said. ''It's like a roller-coaster ride.'' But she has only praise for the ensemble she is a part of (''The quality of actors they get to come on the show is so exciting''), and for Mr. Sorkin's writing. And she finds the challenge of working under the gun and developing a continuing character bracing. ''Aaron's always open to ideas you have, or suggestions about places where you want your character to go,'' she said. ''It's very much for me like being in a movie that never ends.''</p>
