      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Arthur Lubow (July 9) writes that ''the critics' favorites are also the public's favorites,'' as though this were now general wisdom. The story of 20th-century architecture has been the defiance of the tastes, desires and needs of the public in favor of the dictates of a hyperintellectual status game played among an elite. Most people -- of all levels of education -- vastly prefer a good Beaux-Arts building to any of the cold monstrosities created by Koolhaas and others playing the postmodern game. Most of us are all too familiar with the pointless and arrogant ''nose-thumbing gestures'' that have been inflicted on us by modern architecture.</p>
