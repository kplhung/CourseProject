        <p>Camp David Middle East peace summit has failed, but its failure has not derailed process of mutual recognition and adjustment that Israelis and Palestinians began in Oslo seven years ago; its failure is part of that process and illustrates paradox of Middle East peacemaking: going slowly produces impatience and despondence, but going quickly is simply impossible; swift compromise, not inaction, is more likely bring out violence; photo (M)</p>

        <p>THE stakes, American officials warned, had never been higher. To many looking in from the outside, it seemed to be make or break, peace or war. The brink, they feared, was right there: on the other side lay chaos, confrontation and bloodshed.</p>
        <p>But the dirty little secret of the 14-day Camp David Middle East peace summit is that the brink was a myth. The meeting failed; the two sides went home without agreement. Yet no explosion in Israel or the Palestinian territories occurred, nor is chaos expected any time soon. This is because not only was the brink a myth; so, too, were the fears.

        <p>THE stakes, American officials warned, had never been higher. To many looking in from the outside, it seemed to be make or break, peace or war. The brink, they feared, was right there: on the other side lay chaos, confrontation and bloodshed.</p>
        <p>But the dirty little secret of the 14-day Camp David Middle East peace summit is that the brink was a myth. The meeting failed; the two sides went home without agreement. Yet no explosion in Israel or the Palestinian territories occurred, nor is chaos expected any time soon. This is because not only was the brink a myth; so, too, were the fears. In truth, it was never failure of the summit that brought with it the risk of violence. It was success.</p>
        <p>It is sudden compromise that really violates expectations in the Middle East in a way that brings out the dark, violent forces there. Now that Yasir Arafat has resisted a deal, he is hailed by Palestinians as a hero. Now that Ehud Barak did not actually give anything away, the Israeli  government he leads is expected to survive a no-confidence motion this week. But that does not mean the two sides are farther apart than before. They have never been closer.</p>
        <p>This is the paradox of Middle East peacemaking. Going slowly produces impatience and despondence but moving quickly is simply impossible. Camp David had the trappings of a go-for-broke meeting, but it was just one more step in a process of mutual recognition and adjustment begun in Oslo seven years ago. Its failure does not derail that process. It is part of it.</p>
        <p>''The lesson from Camp David is that the alternative to negotiations is not necessarily confrontation and bloodshed but more negotiations,'' said Daniel Ben-Simon, an analyst with the liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz.</p>
        <p>Last week, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators scheduled new meetings on the Israeli-Gaza Strip border. Security chiefs of the two sides kept in daily contact to prevent violence.</p>
        <p>Khalil Shikaki, who directs the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah on the West Bank, agrees that peacemaking is far from over. He argues that the Oslo process showed the two sides that a partial deal was feasible and might be the solution for a longer time than many would like. This means that no solution is likely to emerge soon on sovereignty over the holy sites in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>''Arafat is going to be in good political shape for some time to come,'' Mr. Shikaki said. ''Even if there is no partial deal, both sides have an interest in preventing violence from erupting.'' He added that his polls show that despite the waxing and waning of Mr. Arafat's popularity, the radical Islamic alternative represented by Hamas and Islamic Jihad has not gained at all in popularity in recent years. Total support for those groups has been flat at about 20 percent for five years, he said.</p>
        <p>Of course, nobody knows how this balance would shift if there were concessions on Jerusalem, which stands as the symbol of the Islamic cause in the Holy Land. Many believe that it is not up to Mr. Arafat but to the broader Arab leadership to make concessions on Jerusalem and that is unlikely soon. As long as negotiations continue, that question may not have to be faced in the short term.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shikaki noted that the next deadline is Sept. 13, when Mr. Arafat has warned he will unilaterally announce the existence of a Palestinian state if negotiations have not yet produced it. But Mr. Shikaki acknowledged that that deadline could also be stretched.</p>
        <p>And even if the state is declared, the impact is not clear. Mr. Arafat declared the state's existence once already -- in 1988 -- to little effect. It is true that Palestinians today have a large, lightly armed force inside the West Bank and Gaza Strip, so the declaration could have more bite and could, in fact, lead to violent confrontation. Then again, the intifada of a decade ago is not reproducible now since the soldiers among the Palestinians today are Palestinian, not Israeli. A street revolt, unless actually led by Mr. Arafat, would probably have to start as one against him, and for now that prospect seems remote. Rogue acts of violence could, of course, lead to sympathetic involvement of Palestinian police. But, again, the prevalent view is that such violence would be quelled.</p>
        <p>OTHERS argue that, given the difficult issues, like Jerusalem and refugees, that were on the table, Camp David's failure was not only inevitable but useful. Zev Chafets, a commentator who was head of the Israeli government press office under Prime Minister Menachem Begin 20 years ago, even suggests that the general reaction in the Middle East is relief.</p>
        <p>''When you come down to it, the deal was supposed to be our giving them all this land in exchange for them saying they forgive us,'' Mr. Chafets said. ''But they don't forgive us. We haven't reached that stage yet. So we have to continue as is. We have reached quite a comfortable modus vivendi. The Palestinians still run the Muslim quarter and we still have sovereignty over Maale Adumim.'' He was referring to a large Jewish settlement east of Jerusalem in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>Uri Dromi, who ran the government press office under Yitzhak Rabin, compares the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians to that between a couple going through a divorce while living in the same house.  ''Neither one is going to leave even if they try to make life unbearable for each other. So, in the long run, they adjust and minimize the points of friction.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dromi points to the increasing interaction between people on the two sides as evidence that the process of mutual adjustment is advancing. He says that his brother, a senior police officer, is in frequent contact with Palestinian officers and that even when official relations have been tense, personal ones have been warm. He notes further that every Saturday there are huge traffic jams as thousands of Israelis drive to the West Bank cities of Nablus and Tulkarm to shop. Thousands of others drive to Jericho to gamble. ''These are the same cities where their sons had to chase stone throwers into the alleys of the casbah,'' he mused.</p>
        <p>The reality is indeed new. For two generations, the political divide in Israel was between those on the left who called for ''two states for two peoples'' and those on the right who swore there would never be a Palestinian state. Now the whole discussion is what the contours and powers of that state would be.</p>
        <p>''There is a major realignment going on,'' said Yoram Hazony, a conservative who was an aide to Benjamin Netanyahu when he was prime minister. ''There is, in effect, a condition of political independence for the Palestinians. Today, there is no such thing as a 'not-one-inch' position. Now you hear people on the far right saying that if we are going to trade territory, let's give the Palestinians as many Arab villages in Israel as possible to maximize the Jewish majority in Israel.''</p>
        <p>In fact, there is another useful myth that animated the Camp David peace process: that only the governments of Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat in their current configurations can make this peace and so a historic opportunity is at stake. The same was said of Yitzhak Rabin and Mr. Arafat. After Mr. Rabin's assassination in 1995 by a Jewish extremist, the hawkish Mr. Netanyahu was elected and the doomsayers seemed correct. But the peace process did not die, and it is unlikely to if Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat fail to decide how to share Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>All acknowledge that Jerusalem is the most difficult issue because while land can be divided, it is far less clear how to divide a symbol that is, in Mr. Hazony's words, ''at the heart of what we think we are doing.''</p>
        <p>But it is also a myth that only at Camp David did the issue of Jerusalem first get an airing. It was certainly the first time it was broached directly at the very top, but Jerusalem has been under discussion for quite a while. Yossi Beilin, a senior minister in Mr. Barak's government, negotiated Jerusalem's future with Abu Mazen, a senior Palestinian official, in 1995. The Rabin assassination in November of that year ended those discussions.</p>
        <p>There are many reasons for pessimism over the Israeli-Arab conflict. There is a huge disparity in culture and income and numerous bases of resentment. Meron Benvenisti, a leftist former deputy mayor of Jerusalem and an Israeli expert on the West Bank, is dismissive of the negotiations over Jerusalem neighborhoods and sovereignty sharing because he believes the Israelis still do not take the Palestinians seriously as human beings. That failure, he believes, will bring the process to a very unhappy end.</p>
        <p>''We sit back and feel self-righteous and convert the whole question into whether there will be violence,'' he said. ''The Arabs are interesting to us only as a threat.''</p>
        <p>BUT for many others, the peace process is best seen like the stock market. It may have its frightening ups and downs, but its positive direction in the long term is clear. The key is to avoid irrational exuberance or utter gloom.</p>
        <p>Salameh Nematt, a Jordanian journalist for the Arab newspaper Al Hayat, says he marvels at how much has happened in a decade. ''In the beginning, they spoke of Gaza first,'' he recalled of Israeli proposals in the early 1990's. ''Then it was Gaza and Jericho first and Gaza and Jericho last. Then came Nablus and Tulkarm and then 9 percent of the land and then 13 percent and then talk of maybe 50 percent and now we are hearing about more than 90 percent. Any Israeli government that moves too fast will be burned but so will any government that moves too slowly. The final settlement may take another 10 or 15 years, but it will come. Remember how Israelis who met with Arafat used to go to jail? Now he's their best friend.''</p>
