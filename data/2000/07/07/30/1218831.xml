        <p>THEY may not be as well known as the Fords or the Rockefellers, but the Dorrances live up to the stereotypes of old wealth. They spend their time raising horses and frequenting upper-class haunts like Newport, R.I. Except for a flurry of news reports about a decade ago, when the question of whether they would sell the Campbell Soup Company last arose, they mostly stay out of the papers and keep low profiles. They did not return repeated phone calls over the last month seeking interviews.</p>
        <p>And while John T. Dorrance, the chemist who went to work for his uncle and came up with the idea of condensed soup, spent more than 30 years at Campbell, none of his nine surviving grandchildren are active at the company.</p>
        <p>John T. Jr., known as Jack, was the last Dorrance to run Campbell. His three children split about a third of the company when he died in 1989. The eldest son, John III, whose main claim to fame was his decision in the mid-90's to become an Irish citizen in what some critics viewed as a tax-avoidance move, has sold his stake.  The other two are Campbell directors: Bennett, a Phoenix real estate developer who is active in local philanthropy; and Mary Alice Malone, who owns a horse farm, Iron Spring, in Coatesville, Pa. She is known for competing in dressage.</p>
        <p>George S. Strawbridge Jr. and Diana Strawbridge Wister are the children of Margaret, one of Dr. Dorrance's four sisters. Mr. Strawbridge, who is a Campbell director, has a reputation as a savvy investor whose business sense prevailed over emotion in the mid-90's, when, as a large shareholder, he was instrumental in selling two Philadelphia banks. He is also president of the National Steeplechase Association. Ms. Wister lives in luxurious locales like Mount Desert Island, Me.</p>
        <p>Another branch of the family includes Charlotte Colket Weber and Tristram C. Colket Jr. Ms. Weber, also a Campbell board member, divides her time between New York and Ocala, Fla., where she breeds thoroughbreds. Mr. Colket is a director of Vlasic Foods International, the ailing pickle maker that Campbell spun off in 1998.</p>
        <p>Dorrance Hamilton and Hope van Beuren, the daughters of Elinor, formed a voting trust to pool their shares. Mrs. Hamilton is very active in philanthropy in Philadelphia. Mrs. van Beueren lives near Newport, and her son, Archbold, is the only family member working for Campbell, as president of Godiva Worldwide, in Manhattan.</p>
