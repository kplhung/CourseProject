        <p>Irving Yasgur, Albert Gershenov, Beatrice Yasgur, Doris Gershenov, Mamaroneck, N.Y., November 1999</p>
        <p>(From left) Irving Yasgur: ''That's Al, my brother-in-law, and Beatrice, my wife, and Doris, my sister. Gillian, the photographer, is my granddaughter. Al and I have a perfect relationship -- we're associated in business and we're also related on the outside. I've been working in the real-estate business since 1935. I was a workaholic, but I'm past my 82nd birthday now, so I call myself semiretired. What would I do if I was home? My wife would put me to work. I prefer this kind of work.''</p>

        <p>Irving Yasgur, Albert Gershenov, Beatrice Yasgur, Doris Gershenov, Mamaroneck, N.Y., November 1999</p>
        <p>(From left) Irving Yasgur: ''That's Al, my brother-in-law, and Beatrice, my wife, and Doris, my sister. Gillian, the photographer, is my granddaughter. Al and I have a perfect relationship -- we're associated in business and we're also related on the outside. I've been working in the real-estate business since 1935. I was a workaholic, but I'm past my 82nd birthday now, so I call myself semiretired. What would I do if I was home? My wife would put me to work. I prefer this kind of work.''</p>
        <p>Albert Gershenov: ''Irving and I used to have another partner, my other brother-in-law, who's deceased, and then there's Irving's brother, who's still active. We were known everywhere. How could we stay together so long? Well, we did it. And now that we're winding down our business activities, our social activities have to take over. And I'm going to start with the computer. If you stay active and have loving people with you, getting old is not too difficult. We always pose for pictures; we try to look good. I'd like you to see my wife's closets! I can't even walk out of the house unless everything matches.''</p>
        <p>Beatrice Yasgur: ''Oh, isn't that nice? I'm a star. My husband's helping me out of the limo. Without being pretentious, it's just that we like the comforts. At this stage of our lives, we've earned them. For the picture, we put the fur coats on. And Gillian told me where to look. I was feeling very proud of her. She's going places, we think. Though we're prejudiced, of course.''</p>
        <p>Doris Gershenov: ''We've always been a very tight family. I try to stay involved with our two children and our five grandchildren. It gets even bigger, the responsibility. You're never done. Al and I try to keep busy. I love clothes. I love to dress. I like the beauty shop. I like to keep up with everything. My husband and my brother are semiretired, but it's almost a standing joke, their semiretirement. I think it's very good. We have friends that retired early, and they're falling apart. They have no interests. To do nothing is the hardest thing.''</p>
