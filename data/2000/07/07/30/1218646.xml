        <p>ALL politics, as everyone knows, is local.</p>
        <p>Everyone knows this because there is apparently a rule out there that decrees that every political story with a thinky component must repeat former House Speaker Tip O'Neill's famous aphorism. It is a statistical certainty that someone is typing that very sentence at this exact moment.</p>
        <p>But smart shoppers know that lots of other things are local -- the price of gas, a dozen eggs, the market for novels by Pete Hamil in New York or Lee Smith in North Carolina. (See. You've never heard of her.)</p>
        <p>Thus, lost in the recent cosmic hoo-ha about the cracking of the genetic code (one imagines scientists in white lab coats with eye-masks like old-time safe crackers listening intently for the genetic tumblers to fall into place) has been the obvious question -- what does this mean for Tuckahoe, Yonkers or Bedford? Thus, some important information for Westchester residents about the sequencing of the human genome.</p>
        <p>Q. What is a genome anyway?</p>
        <p>A. You obviously have not been paying attention. Like origami spaghetti, the genome is a form of deoxyribonucleic pasta, which contains all the genetic codes that define the human organism. Thus, all humans, except for the entire fan base of the World Wrestling Federation, contain origami patterns with distinctive loops and logos that make them different from tree sloths or hamsters. Amazingly, Britney Spears and Albert Pirro have identical genomes except for differences in genes and DNA that make her sing like she's gargling all the time.</p>
        <p>Q. Does this mean Westchester residents and people in, say, New Jersey or South Carolina have identical genomes?</p>
        <p>A. Au contraire. In South Carolina, for example, the origami takes a distinctive shape that scientists call the stars and bars, leading people to fight for years over Civil War symbols. In New Jersey, the genetic material is miraculously straight and clotted at the same time, in what is called a ''turnpike'' configuration.</p>
        <p>Q. But don't all genomes contain just four base pairs represented by four letters of the alphabet?</p>
        <p>A. Yes. But. Because of the exquisite subtlety of the genetic language, the four base pairs have different meanings around the globe. In Westchester the first base -- A -- is the holy letter that all good children are expected to bring home each quarter on their magic path to the Ivy League. In Manhattan, the same letter refers to mythical lists, known to top cellular geneticists as ''A Lists,'' which allow supermodels, professional athletes and billionaires into fancy clubs, restaurants and parties. In a typical complication, in Texas, the same letter, amazingly, refers to the first person singular (Ah was thinkin' . . . ). Lucky you took geology instead of genetics to meet your college science requirement.</p>
        <p>Q. What do the three other symbols mean on the Westchester genome?</p>
        <p>A. The symbol C, of course, stands for cars. The symbol T stands for ''Type A.'' In the Midwest, by contrast, the C stands for cows. In Atlanta the T stands for Tomahawk Chop, all astounding examples of the way nature and nurture create human diversity. On the other hand, everywhere in the world, the symbol G, now stands for The Gap.</p>
        <p>Q. What's in it for me?</p>
        <p>A. Scientists are cautiously optimistic that everything that has ever been wrong with everyone who has ever lived can be cured, eradicated or rendered moot by the proper engineering of the genetic material on the human genome. Rather take the Hudson line than the Harlem line in the morning? Tired of the babble at the local nail salon? Wondering why the neighbor's dumb kid got into Harvard while your kid is at the University of Nevada Las Vegas? Wish your dumpy A. &amp; P. was a hip Trader Joe's? With a screwdriver and some duct tape, scientists hope to be able to rearrange genetic material to fix the problems completely. As a fallback, they will be able to turn you into a hamster, so you won't care.</p>
        <p>Q. Where can I pick up the genome of my dreams?</p>
        <p>A. This is a tough one. In the not-too-distant future, choice genomes will be available for sale like Pokemon cards, 'N Sync CD's and extra cupholders for S.U.V.'s. But where to get them -- a fancy mall like The Westchester? Your local village genome dealer? A big-box store like a Sam's or Costco? Molecular biologists are hoping to crack the human shopping code, so far to no avail. So, on this one, you're on your own.</p>
