        <p>T. Ford, chairman of the Alltel Corporation, has joined the corporate brawl over where the University of Arkansas Razorbacks will play, and who will be their most visible sponsors.</p>
        <p>Alltel, based in Little Rock, has rapidly become the nation's fifth-largest cellular carrier, with six million customers. Mr. Ford thought he had hard-wired a 10-year, $800,000 contract to promote his company in and around the city's stadium. But the university's athletic director, Frank Broyles, objected, citing a $10 million sponsorship agreement he had reached with Southwestern Bell, an Alltel competitor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Broyles warned that he was prepared to move the team's home games, now divided between Little Rock and Fayetteville, the university's hometown, all to Fayetteville unless the Little Rock stadium board retreated. In planning to shift more of the schedule to Fayetteville, Mr. Broyles had already angered some Razorback supporters, including Warren A. Stephens, chairman of the Little Rock company whose holdings include the Stephens Inc. brokerage firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford, a university alumnus and longtime Razorback supporter himself, had no comment, but other alumni described him as livid.  Though there were hints of a compromise on Friday, Mr. Broyles has ordered construction crews who are expanding the Fayetteville stadium to work around the clock toward the Sept. 2 season opener, which had been planned for Little Rock.</p>
