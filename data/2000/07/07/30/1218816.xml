        <p>In a David vs. Goliath development, dozens of Staten Island weight lifters were defeated last week, at least temporarily, by a horde of tiny borer worms.</p>
        <p>The worms have gnawed for years at the wooden pilings supporting a pier that juts into New York Harbor near the St. George ferry terminal and on which the Cromwell Recreation Center rests. As the pilings have weakened, parts of the building have sagged toward the water, and cracks have appeared on some inside walls.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the city's Department of Parks and Recreation, which owns the center, closed the weight room in preparation for an estimated $100,000 to $150,000 project to shore up the pilings and repair damage to the building.</p>
        <p>Steve Joseph, a center member, said he arrived on Wednesday morning to work out, but found Parks Department employees carting equipment from the weight room. The employees could not tell him how long the room would be closed or where the equipment was going, he said.</p>
        <p>Later that afternoon, Mr. Joseph returned to the center and stood in the rain while passing out fliers to other members. Under the headline, ''Help Save Cromwell!'' the flier urged members to get in touch with  their elected officials and ''let them know you want temporary facilities set up if the center must close for repairs.''</p>
        <p>The first deputy commissioner of the Parks Department, Alan M. Moss, said the department plans to do just that. Though no part of the  building is in danger of collapse, the weight room will temporarily be moved across the street to Lyons Pool, he said. Space will be made for the weight room equipment in a locker room at the pool, which is also operated by the Parks Department, he said.</p>
        <p>The Cromwell Center, which has about 100 patrons a day in summer, underwent a $5.5 million renovation in 1994 that included wrapping pilings in concrete to protect against borer worms. But Mr. Moss said the pilings were exposed again as the mud line around them dropped four feet in the last six years, probably from tidal action and the wash from boats that use nearby Miller's Launch.</p>
        <p>He said the new renovation would resheath the pilings in concrete and jack up sagging parts of the building. The center's other programs, like basketball, boxing, and computer and tai chi classes, will probably remain open while repairs are done, he said.</p>
        <p>A department spokesman, Bob Lawson, said last Thursday that the department expected to open the temporary weight room at Lyons Pool early this week.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Joseph wondered why he and other members had not been notified of the plan. ''They should at least let us know,'' he said.</p>
