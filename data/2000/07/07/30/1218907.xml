      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Three boys were having about as much fun as is possible to have on a 50-foot stretch of asphalt.</p>
        <p>They were playing outside a home in New City in Rockland County, waiting to leave for a fishing trip on the Hudson River. But they had some time to spare as the grown-ups loaded the car with water, snacks and life preservers.</p>
        <p>For 15 minutes the threesome zoomed up and down the mild incline in the driveway, sitting, standing and lying belly-down on their identical blue skateboards.</p>
        <p>''Woo-hooo-hooooo,'' said James Weisbecker, 5, as he edged out his two rivals on a downhill roll. ''See you later -- I won the race.''</p>
        <p>Jose Viciedo, also 5, from Brooklyn, said, ''That's cheating!''</p>
        <p>The third boy, Romell Burrus, a 7-year-old from Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, did not say much at all, but as he rolled his skateboard back and forth in the warm afternoon sun he had a wide smile that was perhaps more telling than any words could be.</p>
        <p>Jose and Romell were guests at James's home in New City; their visit was arranged by the Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that provides free summer vacations to needy children from New York City. But the boys seemed more like brothers, arguing one minute and playing the next, as if they had been living together for years. Jose, an affectionate boy, had grown comfortable enough in a few days with James's parents, Joanne and Gary Weisbecker, to call them ''Mommy'' and ''Daddy.''</p>
        <p>Jose and Romell were staying with the Weisbeckers through the fund's Friendly Town program, which pairs city children with rural and suburban families and individuals who volunteer to be hosts to the children for two weeks in the summer. The fund also runs five summer camps in Fishkill, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weisbecker, who has been a New York City police officer for 21 years, was himself a beneficiary of the Friendly Town program when he was about his son's age.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Weisbecker was growing up in the Queensbridge Houses, a large public housing project at the foot of the Queensboro Bridge, his mother, Emma, enrolled him and his older brother, Wayne, in the program, which placed them with a family in rural Pennsylvania who owned a dairy farm.</p>
        <p>''It was just, 'Wow, there's other things than the project,' '' Mr. Weisbecker recalled of the trip to the farm. ''Instead of seeing shots of it in a book you actually got to see it. You actually got to interact with a real live cow.''</p>
        <p>In part because of his childhood experiences, Mr. Weisbecker said, he volunteered to serve as a host to children about his son's age. But there was another reason he wanted to volunteer: his experience as a New York police officer in Harlem.</p>
        <p>''You see the same kids, you get to know them,'' he said of his job. ''They just don't know anything in the hot summer months except the block they live on -- 115th Street between Seventh and Eighth.''</p>
        <p>Taking in the children has created additional work and expenses for the Weisbeckers, but it has given their son two new playmates and has opened up a new world to Jose and Romell. And the couple said they had the satisfaction of knowing they were helping to make a difference.</p>
        <p>Before Romell and Jose got ready for the fishing trip, Mr. Weisbecker took them to see Chester, the groundhog who lives underneath a shed in the backyard. When they returned, Jose showed Mr. Weisbecker a collection of Matchbox cars he was playing with.</p>
        <p>''Which one is your favorite?'' Mr. Weisbecker asked.</p>
        <p>''This one,'' Jose said, holding one.</p>
        <p>''Can I have it?'' Mr. Weisbecker asked.</p>
        <p>''No,'' Jose said. ''You'll make it crash out.''</p>
        <p>''Would I do that?'' Mr. Weisbecker asked with a smile.</p>
        <p>The boys were still playing on the driveway when the family was ready to go to their boat at a nearby marina in Haverstraw. Because Romell stayed with the family last year, he was familiar with the boat. But to Jose, who joined the Weisbeckers for the first time this year, the 24-foot powerboat was all new.</p>
        <p>''Is it like a car?'' he asked from the dock when he first saw the boat.</p>
        <p>Later, as he and the two other boys sat in the boat wearing their life preservers, Jose began to get worried. ''We're going to drown,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''You're not going to drown,'' Mrs. Weisbecker assured him.</p>
        <p>Shortly after that the family took their guests on a ride out to the river, where they anchored near an area beach, and paddled about in inner tubes. The highlight of the trip for Jose was seeing the trains on both sides of the Hudson.</p>
        <p>''He's never seen freight trains up close,'' Mrs. Weisbecker said. ''On the river, both sides have trains. They were constantly passing by. He got such a thrill seeing them pass into the tunnel.''</p>
        <p>Families who are interested in having a child stay with them or who wish to inquire about registering their children for a Fresh Air summer vacation may call (800) 367-0003 or visit the agency's Web site, www.freshair.org. Anyone interested in making a tax-deductible contribution to the agency may send a check to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.</p>
