        <p>KAIROS, a new CD label specializing in recent and contemporary music, is well worth attention. Distributed here by Koch International, it is based in Germany, and several of its early releases feature Klangforum Wien, probably the most vital European group performing new music at the moment. The repertory indicates a definite taste for intensity and reaching to extremes.</p>
        <p>Morton Feldman and Giacinto Scelsi are the label's first old masters, both represented by major pieces played by the Vienna Klangforum, but at the moment there is no shortage of adequate and even excellent recordings of their music. More immediately valuable are two other items from the initial batch: an update on the work of Salvatore Sciarrino, who is perhaps the most fascinating and certainly the most fecund and versatile of European composers now in their 50's; and a first chance to get to know the music of Matthias Pintscher, the German composer who, still in his 20's, scored a hit with his opera ''Thomas Chatterton'' in Dresden a couple of years ago and is now at work on a second opera, ''Heliogabal,'' for the Salzburg Festival next year.</p>

        <p>KAIROS, a new CD label specializing in recent and contemporary music, is well worth attention. Distributed here by Koch International, it is based in Germany, and several of its early releases feature Klangforum Wien, probably the most vital European group performing new music at the moment. The repertory indicates a definite taste for intensity and reaching to extremes.</p>
        <p>Morton Feldman and Giacinto Scelsi are the label's first old masters, both represented by major pieces played by the Vienna Klangforum, but at the moment there is no shortage of adequate and even excellent recordings of their music. More immediately valuable are two other items from the initial batch: an update on the work of Salvatore Sciarrino, who is perhaps the most fascinating and certainly the most fecund and versatile of European composers now in their 50's; and a first chance to get to know the music of Matthias Pintscher, the German composer who, still in his 20's, scored a hit with his opera ''Thomas Chatterton'' in Dresden a couple of years ago and is now at work on a second opera, ''Heliogabal,'' for the Salzburg Festival next year.</p>
        <p>This debut CD (0012052KAI) includes a big scena for baritone and orchestra drawn from his first opera: enough, easily, to make one understand the work's success. Chatterton, the English poet on whose life and death the opera is based, died at 17, but Mr. Pintscher gives him a full, mature baritone voice (beautifully and strongly brought to life here by Urban Malmberg), the voice of his dreams and ambitions, which are so much bigger than he is. The story, as Mr. Pintscher puts it, is ''the failure of an 'overproductive' young creative person who was incapable of channeling his powers and talents and is finally brought down as a result of his escape to his second, self-created level of consciousness, which became increasingly incompatible with reality.''</p>
        <p>Having won prizes and renown with a string quartet he wrote at 21, Mr. Pintscher could have felt himself a possible victim of the Chatterton complex. But like his English contemporary Thomas Ades, he has proved resilient to fame. The orchestral music of ''Chatterton,'' to judge from the excerpts linked here in ''Musik aus 'Chatterton,' '' may show debts to Berg, but it is finely and precisely imagined. The vocal line is powerfully lyrical. And the big climax is tremendous, when Chatterton keeps repeating the word ''longing'' but, however vociferously he sings, cannot break through the wall of orchestral sound.</p>
        <p>The orchestra was magical when he was singing of his poetic visions, then impulsive when he turned to his confidence in the literary acclaim he would find in London, but here it only underlines his insufficiency, in an image that enforces Mr. Pintscher's portrait of a man whose expressive voice is not strong enough to carry the world with him. (It is a pity, though, that only the program notes, and not the sung text, are translated into English.)</p>
        <p>Also on the record are two orchestral scores: ''Choc'' (1996), for a large group of soloists, and Five Orchestral Pieces (1997), for full symphony orchestra. ''Choc'' is music of sudden gestures, holes of silence, deep bass sounds and metallic scintillations from percussion. It is, again, a marvelous display of instrumental imagination, not inappropriately taking its title from a line by Rimbaud: ''Music, veering of chasms and shock of ice on star.''</p>
        <p>But the most consistently impressive music comes in the Five Orchestral Pieces, where the writing is more personal than in the ''Chatterton'' suite. Mr. Pintscher writes complex sounds, often with rattling, growling, tolling or tingling percussion colored by other instruments, and through most of this score such sounds, coming slowly, one by one, give the impression the orchestra is trying to speak.</p>
        <p>Its efforts are carried from movement to movement. Only the second, a tumultuous moto perpetuo, is different in character. And the fourth is unusual in that it falters so soon, stalling because it can find no satisfactory way to get going. The others make more progress, with difficulty. In each, an eventual tutti arrives only after a sequence of exquisite and touching frustrated utterances -- and arrives perhaps as a failure, since frustration, under desperate conditions, is what the piece is about. The finale, after its tutti climax, yields the first and only significant melody, a poignant line for English horn, followed by a protracted sigh.</p>
        <p>AS in ''Chatterton,'' Mr. Pintscher seems to be making music out of his creative unease, which is by no means simply a personal problem but rather the unease of a whole generation coming of age at a time of cultural stagnation. Chatterton the poet may have suffered from an exaggerated sense of his genius, yet the question now is whether the institutions and the continuing traditions exist to enable composers to go on with their work. One must hope that the beautiful if melancholy orchestral vocables of Mr. Pintscher's Five Orchestral Pieces are not dying gasps but snatches of new breath.</p>
        <p>He himself conducts the Berlin Radio Symphony, in telling performances both of this work and of the ''Chatterton'' music. Klangforum plays excitingly for Sylvain Cambreling in ''Choc.''</p>
        <p>Future Kairos releases promise much: albums devoted to the works of Peter Eotvos and Hanspeter Kyburz, and a recording of Luigi Nono's long violin aria ''La Lontanaza Nostalgica Utopica Futura'' supervised by Mr. Sciarrino.</p>
