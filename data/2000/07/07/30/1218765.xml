        <p>The former chairman of the Nassau County Democratic Party, Stephen J. Sabbeth, has been sentenced to 97 months in jail after being convicted of bankruptcy fraud and money-laundering in connection with his failed lumber business.</p>
        <p>''It was a substantial sentence that will most assuredly send a message that bankruptcy fraud will not be tolerated,'' said an assistant United States attorney, Charles Kleinberg, who was the lead federal prosecutor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabbeth, 53, was convicted of defrauding creditors after the 1990 bankruptcy of his company by concealing more than $1 million in accounts opened with false names and Social Security numbers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabbeth was also sentenced to three years' probation and ordered to pay $125,000 in restitution to the banks he defrauded, Fleet and Chase Manhattan. His wife, Carole, was sentenced in January to four months in prison and four months of home detention for her role. She was also ordered to repay the banks $75,000 and sentenced to three years' probation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabbeth was unavailable for comment and his lawyer, Gustave Newman, did not return phone calls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabbeth's July 21 sentencing came three months after the former chairman of the Suffolk County Republican Party, John Powell, was sentenced to 27 months in prison for his part in a truck- and car-theft ring and in a separate bribery scheme.</p>
