        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Erik Tarloff, in his negative review of my book ''Spytime: The Undoing of James Jesus Angleton'' (July 16), substantially rests his case against it on an extraordinary claim -- his, not the novel's. ''It's a book with a thesis: It purports to identify the fifth man in the Soviet spy ring.'' (What?) He reports that I speak of ''the life of James Jesus Angleton, with a shock at the end expressly designed to redeem the man's entire career.'' (Redeem it? -- I pronounced him edged into looniness.) ''In the author's mind,'' Tarloff writes, the novel ''may have been heading toward this surprise all along, but nothing in the text suggests it.'' No wonder. Nothing in the text is intended to suggest it, and the so-called shock at the end isn't over the discovery of the Fifth Man but over the terminal illusion of the protagonist.</p>

        <p>Having egregiously misread the plot, Tarloff goes on amply to excerpt from erotic passages in my novel, on which excerpts I would comment except that merely to pass my eyes over them brings on such ardor as to leave me immobilized.</p>
