        <p>WHAT'S next?</p>
        <p>Martha Stewart could look for houses to make over by interviewing shoppers at the Kmart in West Orange. The people from ''Sex in the City'' could see if sanitation workers in Hoboken measured up, having had much success with firemen from Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Yes, I finally realize the watchwords of our age: Televito ergo sum. I appear on TV, therefore I am.</p>
        <p>What led me to commit this profundity?</p>
        <p>I thought I would swing by Harrison High School last Saturday on my way into Manhattan. According to MapQuest, the trip was just five miles -- 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, MapQuest didn't know that 14,000 other people were also going. I am talking, of course, about the open casting call for extras on the HBO series ''The Sopranos.''</p>
        <p>Forget the 20 minutes I spent lost in Newark. When I finally got on Route 280, just yards from the exit where I would get off, I found myself in the biggest traffic jam I had ever seen. After a while, I noticed a gold sedan driven by a nice-looking guy with slicked-back silver hair and cool shades, with a crucifix dangling from the rearview mirror. Ahead of me, in a red Honda, a woman with long dark hair was looking in a compact and adjusting her lipstick.</p>
        <p>Then a radio report confirmed what I had begun to suspect; it was a ''Sopranos'' traffic jam.</p>
        <p>Fearing that I would never get there, or anywhere again, I rolled down my window and began to interview other drivers. When I finally arrived 45 minutes later, I pulled into the parking lot at Mulligan Funeral Home and encountered one of the strangest sights I had ever seen.</p>
        <p>Harrison had turned into a Hollywood movie set. Women with big black hair, little tank tops and sandals with heels, men in black shirts, more gold necklaces than 47th Street. And everyone was talking into a cell phone and carrying envelopes containing 8-by-10 glossies. I met an investment banker from Staten Island, a car wash owner from Danbury, Conn., actresses from Bloomfield and Manhattan and a pharmaceutical executive from Summit, who all wanted the same thing.</p>
        <p>''I feel I have a certain look, a bad guy look,'' said Anthony Colangelo of Danbury. He had a tattoo of the grim reaper on one arm and of a peacock on a rose bush on the other, both of which peeked out from the tightest black muscle shirt you could buy without a prescription.</p>
        <p>It didn't really matter that by the time I got there, they were already turning people away. Harrison had become a street fair of aspiring celebrity. Even when it was clear that the casting agents had stopped letting people in, the mob wannabes milled around happily. John Baty of Washington Township, who was waiting in the same funeral home parking lot for his 25-year-old son Joshua, an actor, good-naturedly offered to watch my car. When I came back, Joshua was there, too.</p>
        <p>''I got right up to the door and the cop poked his finger on my chest,'' Joshua Baty said dramatically. ''He said, 'Somebody's got to be first. Is it going to be you?' I thought I was going for an audition. He was really talking about bringing me down.''</p>
        <p>To the station, that is. Mob control.</p>
        <p>Even little children were getting into the act. I passed a boy running to tell his father that he had already made $20 selling lemonade.</p>
        <p>I turned down the lemonade myself, but gave his co-workers some advice: ''Raise your prices.'' They were suckers selling it for just 50 cents.</p>
        <p>This was hardly the first crowd I had encountered recently. A few weeks ago, there was the midnight madness surrounding media event known as Harry Potter. Months earlier, I had found myself in a throng that had been enticed to a Marriott on Route 3 under the guise of previewing new television shows. ''I'm going to get discovered,'' a young lady behind me said. Fat chance. The ''preview'' was little more than a market-research scheme to discover people's favorite brands of flea powder.</p>
        <p>All this during the summer of reality TV, following the spring of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' What will people do next for 15 seconds of fame? Eat a rat?</p>
        <p>Better yet, why don't you swing by my house and suggest ideas for future columns. Parking's free. Lemonade, though, is $20 a glass.</p>
