        <p>Israelis and Palestinians are trying to pick up where they left off at the unsuccessful Camp David summit meeting and continue moving toward a final peace agreement. It is now critically important to sustain some of the positive momentum established there.</p>
        <p>Today, senior negotiators from both sides are to resume discussions on a range of unsettled issues. The negotiators were close to the Camp David discussions and are aware of the path-breaking compromises discussed there on security and border issues, Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements. America stands ready to remain involved, with Washington's Mideast mediator, Dennis Ross, and perhaps Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, prepared to re-enter the discussions if sufficient progress can be made.</p>
        <p>But progress is far from assured, especially with Yasir Arafat talking about proclaiming a Palestinian state if no agreement is reached by Sept. 13. With that possibility in mind, President Clinton suggested last week that he might consider relocating America's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to West Jerusalem. Like most other countries, the United States resists treating Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Such a move would be particularly sensitive now, with East Jerusalem the central issue of the peace talks.</p>
        <p>At Camp David, Israel was prepared to consider an American compromise plan that would have given Mr. Arafat a presidential office in the Old City of Jerusalem. It would also have joined some Arab areas of East Jerusalem to Arab suburbs now outside the city to form, in effect, a new, Palestinian-ruled city of Arab Jerusalem. A bridge would have linked these Palestinian-ruled areas to Muslim holy sites in the Old City, guaranteeing unimpeded access to these shrines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, regrettably, showed no interest in this proposal, holding out for full control of all areas of the city formerly under Jordanian rule. Talks on Jerusalem cannot usefully resume until Mr. Arafat shows a greater willingness to compromise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat seems to feel he cannot do so. His rigidity reflects his failure to prepare Palestinian opinion for anything less than full sovereignty over East Jerusalem. But it also reflects the vocal opposition of Arab countries like Saudi Arabia to recognizing any Israeli sovereignty there. This Arab opposition must be defused in the weeks ahead.</p>
        <p>At home, Mr. Barak faces fresh challenges to his government. But polls taken since Camp David show strong support for continued peace efforts. Longstanding taboos in Israeli politics were broken at Camp David. The possible compromises discussed there by Mr. Barak are now being digested by the Israeli public. Equally bold moves are needed from the Palestinians, especially on Jerusalem.</p>
