        <p>This is about statues, the one of Harold Connolly planned for his old neighborhood in Boston and the one of Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese that doesn't seem to be growing in Brooklyn.

        <p>This is about statues, the one of Harold Connolly planned for his old neighborhood in Boston and the one of Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese that doesn't seem to be growing in Brooklyn. I'm sure there are universal historical, social and political issues in all this, and if you find them, send them along. Why has thelipsite@aol.com been overloaded lately with more paeans to Mark Messier than to Linda Bensel-Meyers, the Tennessee whistle-blower? Beats me.</p>
        <p>The plan to erect a statue of Jackie and Pee Wee was officially announced last year by the Giuliani administration after a campaign begun years ago by Stan Isaacs, then a Newsday sports columnist. The financier and philanthropist Ted Forstmann pledged the funding. A sculptor and a Brooklyn site have yet to be named, in part because the city seems to have thought that a press release was enough, in part because of a philosophic disagreement over how the relationship of Jackie and Pee Wee should be cast in stone.</p>
        <p>With two appealing young athletes usually described as ''black'' now standing astride America's signature white sports of golf and tennis, it requires some effort to return to 1947, when Robinson became the first recognized African-American to play major league baseball. Robinson's debut was orchestrated by white men, most importantly Branch Rickey, the Dodger general manager. While mostly white business people will decide just how much Tiger Woods and Venus Williams will earn from their talent, ambition and charisma, the decision to place them in fame's way was not a white decision; strong nuclear families, in particular visionary, risk-taking fathers, set them on their paths and ran interference right to the top.</p>
        <p>To properly appreciate this real progress, how much history do we need to hang onto? One turning point in the Robinson epic, nicely retold in Peter Golenbock's illustrated children's book, ''Teammates'' (Harcourt Brace, 1990), occurred early that first season, in Cincinnati, not far from Pee Wee's Louisville home. As Reds fans spewed hate onto the field, Pee Wee strolled over from shortstop and put his arm on Jackie's shoulders. The white Dodger captain was wordlessly saying, ''This black man is my teammate.'' The mostly white campaigners for the statue would like to memorialize that gesture.</p>
        <p>Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow and the force behind the educational foundation named for him, said last week that although she appreciated the gesture, she would prefer a statue in which the two players were depicted as ''equals.'' She remembered a photograph in which they are leaving the field, shoulder to shoulder, their hands almost touching.</p>
        <p>''That would be more of a tribute to both of them,'' she said. ''There have been too many instances of a white person elevated at the expense of a black person.''</p>
        <p>The statue of Harold Connolly, who won the 1956 Olympic gold medal in the hammer throw, is to be erected on the grounds of Brighton High School, where he played football despite a twisted, foreshortened left arm crippled by a birth accident. So much of Connolly's early life seemed to have been spent hiding the arm and compensating for it.</p>
        <p>A former high school teacher who recently retired from a second career as a Special Olympics executive, Connolly, who turns 69 on Tuesday, has been writing his memoirs, mostly for his children. The pages I've read about his left arm have been particularly candid and moving. He writes: ''Concentrating on the Herculean effort of raising my left arm up and sideways, I slowly placed my right hand above her left hip and groped for her finger-tips with my half-closed left hand. She, however, had to be the one who finally took my limp hand into hers; and I became very much aware that she knew and either felt repulsed or sorry for me.''</p>
        <p>And that was just dancing class. Connolly identifies himself as ''a handicapped person'' who ''knows the agony of all-out trying and not accomplishing.'' After years of physical therapy as a child, he writes: ''I began to consider myself a reject, chained to a small army of twisted bodies in the hospital waiting room and responded by trying to ignore my crippled associates. I wanted to push myself into the 'normal' society.''</p>
        <p>Connolly paid his own way through college and to Europe to compete, perfecting an explosive, spinning style that compensated for his weak arm with speed and leg power. Defensive and shy, he made himself into a fierce, sometimes ruthless competitor and Boston's second gold-medal Connolly. A statue of James B. Connolly, America's first Olympic champion, stands in South Boston, a rival neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Of his own statue, Harold Connolly says, ''I certainly hope my left arm will be rendered realistically by the sculptor, as it appears to others, not as it appears in my mind's eye, filtered to look as much as possible to be the arm I wish it were.''</p>
