        <p>Inside the Halo</p>
        <p>and Beyond</p>
        <p>The Anatomy of a Recovery.</p>
        <p>By Maxine Kumin.</p>
        <p>206 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $21.95.</p>
        <p>A t 73, Maxine Kumin, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, wife, mother, lover of horses and vegetables, had an accident that nearly killed her. She was preparing her beloved horse Deuter for a dressage event in a carriage-driving show in Vermont. The horse was startled by a truck passing on the road and turned the carriage over. Kumin broke her neck and suffered serious internal injuries, including a punctured lung, bruised kidneys and liver and 11 broken ribs. She was taken by helicopter to a hospital trauma center where, gasping for breath, heartbeat faint, spirit hovering, unable at first to move limbs, she was saved. Ninety-five percent of all those with injuries as severe as hers die, her doctor later told her. Ninety-five percent of those who survive are left permanently quadriplegic. Kumin won this most cruel lottery. ''Inside the Halo and Beyond'' is the story of that hard victory.</p>
        <p>The halo is a metal apparatus screwed unmercifully into the skull of a patient to keep the neck in position while the vertebrae heal. Kumin describes it: ''Imagine a bird cage big enough for a large squawking parrot. Nothing fancy; no rococo bars with curlicues at the top, just a sturdy cage fashioned from titanium and graphite . . . fastened by four titanium pins that dig into the skull. The pins are as sharp as ice picks.'' It is almost impossible to sleep inside this immobilizing ring of steel. Pain is enormous. Fear of permanent paralysis haunts. Helplessness humiliates and despair follows. But Maxine Kumin is protected and nurtured by the care of her husband, Victor, by her daughter Judith, who flies in from Geneva, and her son, Danny, who lives nearby. The family surrounds her with loving hands so tender, so persistent, so firm, that one almost feels she was pulled into recovery by their concerted will, supported by her own valiant and admirable determination.</p>
        <p>Kumin is transferred to a rehabilitation hospital and begins to work on regaining strength in legs and arms and her useless hands. The effort made is enormous. The gains are slow. The fear and exhaustion and pain are endless. Gradually she befriends her fellow patients and we see her growing concern and friendship for her young roommate, Nicole, who fell off a ladder into what is in all likelihood permanent paralysis, as well as her therapy companion, Richard, who swerved to avoid a deer and may never walk again.</p>
        <p>We learn about Kumin's life before the accident. She was a lover of horses and dogs and her family. We learn about the land she lives on in New Hampshire, her vegetable garden, the birds and flowers that have become her familiars. We meet her children, learn of the wedding of one, Jane, which takes place while she is in the hospital. She resents the surgeon who suggests to her on learning the cause of her accident that horses belong in Alpo cans. This reader is very sympathetic to that surgeon's position, but Kumin is not angry at her horse. Rather, she is profoundly relieved that he survived the incident unscathed.</p>
        <p>The book describes Kumin's recovery in language that is both precise and spare. She does not wallow in ghastly details or bring us in so close we need to feel embarrassed for her or ourselves. Her books of poetry portray the everyday, the natural world and our part in it. The personal vision that animates her poems fills these pages too. She notices tomato vines and horse hooves and footprints in the snow and sunflower seeds and cats prowling. The book is rarely poetic in the usual sense of heightened metaphor or compacted image. But here is her wish to be able to sleep: ''If only, like Ra, I could drop down under the world and begin the slow journey back to sunrise.'' She gives us specifics: Thera-Putty embedded with nasty little pegs, fluoroscopy, lateral cervical X-ray, as well as horse names like Boomer, garden words like wild asparagus, garlic chives with white blossoms.</p>
        <p>This book, while telling of a most personal catastrophe, ties us continually into the natural world that provides the center of this author's life and work. It bears no relation to the confessional story or the cathartic prose of so many survivors of terror. There is an absence of hysteria. Instead, a calm emanates from the structure of the sentences, whose stately cadences reassure the reader even as they mark out the hard times.</p>
        <p>Maxine Kumin presents us with a portrait of a woman who is beloved. She is a woman with a certain spiritual wholeness, as if her mind, unlike so many of her readers', had not been fractured with resentments, failures of humankind. Her respect for life in all its forms, animal, vegetable and mineral, is both gracious and soothing.</p>
        <p>A reader understands the impulse for this book. This poet has been in the belly of the beast and returned almost unscathed to tell us of her experience. She writes from neither a confessional nor a reportorial, let's-keep-history-straight impulse. The book is more akin to a dignified prayer of thanks. We don't see everything here or know everything. The author has a very tight rein on our sightlines. Is her family as perfect as she describes? Is every nook of her home as filled with the warmth of human and animal affection as she claims? My common sense tells me that some license has been taken. But because the book won my friendship and admiration for this so sorely tested writer I will assume that what I don't see isn't there. ''Inside the Halo and Beyond'' serves as a silhouette against the horizon, resonating wisdom while announcing a triumph of body and soul.</p>
        <p>Anne Roiphe's most recent book is ''1185 Park Avenue,'' a memoir.</p>
