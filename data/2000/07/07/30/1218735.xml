        <p>MACY GRAY is such a refreshing talent that it is easy to forget that Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys dominate the music world.</p>
        <p>A cross between old-school blues-jazz divas like Billie Holiday, Nina Simone and Betty Davis and contemporary R&amp;B influences like Tina Turner, Al Green, Stevie Wonder and Sly Stone (with a bit of Janis Joplin thrown in), Ms. Gray both demands and defies comparisons.</p>
        <p>She possesses none of the traditional accouterments a pop star requires. She does not have a cookie-cutter pop voice. Her songs, which she co-writes, are about substantial, provocative topics -- yet she has found success, earning two Grammy nominations this past year. And if you ever doubted how unfair real life is, the wholly unoriginal teenage sensation Christina Aguilera won the Best New Artist category over the 30-year-old Ms. Gray.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Gray was growing up in Ohio, her unusually tart, raspy voice was the subject of ridicule. At times she stopped speaking. ''Kids used to make fun of my funny voice when I was a kid,'' she said, ''so I stopped talking. Forget about singing. I didn't know I could do that.''</p>
        <p>She studied classical piano for seven years, and that structure and discipline is evident in her phrasing technique. She only began singing in college, at the University of Southern California, where she was studying screenwriting. She recorded a demo with a group of musician friends after the scheduled vocalist failed to show up at the studio. Ms. Gray began to sing with a local jazz band, and soon became a sought-after session vocalist. (That's her on the ''Winter Wonderland'' Gap ad.)</p>
        <p>Then her life changed. In mid-1999, Epic released her debut ''On How Life Is,'' a refreshingly different retro-soul, hip-pop recording that has since sold six million copies worldwide.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gray's sly sound, a cyclonic combination of 1970's-styled soul, pop and funk, is propelled by a voice that is gritty, tangy and unrefined. A throaty, sly, languid seductiveness permeates her music.</p>
        <p>Most of ''Life'' reflects on drugged-out (long-term and one-night-stand) boyfriends who do her wrong. Ms. Gray is quite explicit when she writes about sex (''Sex-o-matic Venus Freak''), and while Alanis Morissette and Liz Phair might perk up their ears, she is far from the raunch of Foxy Brown and Lil' Kim, although she certainly incorporates their street smarts. Reminiscent of Prince at his best, she explores the spiritual and carnal sides of a relationship.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gray's music is not the stuff of prissy teenage divas like Ms. Spears and Ms. Aguilera. These songs are biting vignettes documenting the world of one tough girl. She says her material is inspired by her life, so it makes one wonder when listening to the insolent, yet jaunty gem ''I've Committed Murder'' -- a song of revenge about a cold-hearted woman who robs and kills the employer who degraded her lover. And she brags about getting away with it. All that is backed by a lush arrangement of marimbas, organs and vibes.</p>
        <p>Her gutsy lolling anthem, ''I Try'' exhibits such liquid grace, that it is near impossible to banish it from that part of the mind that replays songs all day. The ballad ''Still'' effectively evokes early Aretha Franklin.</p>
        <p>In performance, Ms. Gray is an awkward, yet beautiful sight; a gangly dynamo enraptured, like her audience, by her hypnotic music. Fronting a swinging 10-piece band, her performance is like a wild old-time R&amp;B revival, and on this current tour, she steals the show out from under Carlos Santana.</p>
        <p>''I'm just going to have fun with this as long as I can,'' she said. ''I'm going to keep on doing what I do, not gonna change anything, and we'll see how it all evolves.''</p>
        <p>Macy Gray is an imposing detour from the oversanitized, predictable music that is congesting the radio waves. As a live performer, they just don't make them like that anymore.</p>
