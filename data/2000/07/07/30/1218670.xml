        <p>CLAUDE BAILLS learned his trade in his native southern France and spent years cooking in world-class French kitchens. But his bistro here is a sort of homecoming for him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baills (the name rhymes with fries) started out at 13, scrubbing pots and peeling vegetables in the sweaty kitchen of a Moroccan-owned restaurant in St.-Tropez. After a hitch in the French Army, he graduated to a luxury liner, the France, then found himself in Manhattan, working for the great chef Andre Soltner in the pioneering early years of Lutece.</p>
        <p>Up the ladder he went, to the Palace and Le Plaisir and the Four Seasons. By the late 1970's he had his own Upper East Side restaurant, Claude's, a soigne little place that earned three stars from The Times's famously demanding Mimi Sheraton. And in the late 80's, weary of New York, he crossed the river to Bergen County, took over the ancient, sprawling Ho Ho Kus Inn and transformed it into a destination restaurant, reputedly a favorite of Richard M. Nixon's.</p>
        <p>So what makes the Chef's Table, with just 12 tables in a former pizza parlor in a strip mall in the far northwestern reaches of Bergen County, a homecoming?</p>
        <p>Simply this: almost everything about it says home. It is, for one thing, just a few miles from Mr. Baills's own home, in Oakland. The paintings and copper pots on the walls are from his house, and some of the herbs in the dishes are from his garden. The hostess is his wife and longtime business partner, Dolores. The space -- bright and airy yet cozy, with lace curtains hanging from brass railings -- suggests a dining room in a French country house. The jolly headwaiter remembers you from visit to visit. Your fellow diners look like your parents.</p>
        <p>The restaurant's very name, as retro as you'll find in an era of cryptic monosyllables -- Dish, Maize, Rat's -- harks back to Mr. Baills's early days in New York, that pleasant, departed, checked-tablecloth time when ''fine dining'' meant just one thing: French.</p>
        <p>And so, for better and for worse, does the menu. Mr. Baills, 57, is enormously capable, and he knows how to be creative -- how to make full use of a leg of lamb, for instance, thereby minimizing waste and keeping prices tolerable. (A three-course meal without wine -- you bring your own -- averages $45 with tax and tip.)</p>
        <p>But he has long since shed any ambition to be called adventurous. He talks nostalgically of the old days, when chefs never bounded triumphantly into the dining room but ''stayed in the kitchen, and after that played boccie.'' And he revels in the knowledge that his customers still demand the food he learned to cook two generations ago in France. ''The bistro dishes do so well, I'm surprised,'' he told me. ''People still say, 'I want duck a l'orange.' ''</p>
        <p>The menu is divided, arbitrarily, into French and Italian ''flavors.''  Italian because New Jersey is, after all, Italian-restaurant territory (one of Mr. Baills's stops on the long road to Franklin Lakes was Il Tulipano, in Cedar Grove); arbitrarily because that side of the menu includes leek-and-onion tart and chicken cordon bleu.</p>
        <p>Not that national boundaries mean much here. The place is a European Union of bistro food. One night, to make use of some leftover lamb, Mr. Baills offered moussaka, a Greek dish he'd learned working alongside Lebanese cooks in St.-Tropez. Whatever its origins, it could not be faulted -- a full-flavored concoction of thin-sliced eggplant and ground lamb in the shape of an inverted muffin, surrounded by buttery mashed potatoes and a moat of tomato coulis.</p>
        <p>That leek-and-onion tart, served as an appetizer, is a classic too, though about as Italian as the Champs-Elysees -- rich, eggy, cheesy, in a crisp puff-pastry crust. Other first courses are tossed off with equal assurance: five snails in little ceramic crocks with puff-pastry crowns, in a simple and redolent sauce of butter, parsley and garlic; mild, well-cured gravlax with perfectly cooked green beans in a mustard vinaigrette; unctuous rounds of good goat cheese in a walnut crust, atop mixed greens and tomatoes; six crescents of grilled polenta with a hearty, earthy toss of sauteed wild mushrooms; six littleneck clams under a mantle of browned bread crumbs, tasting of garlic and herbs and the sea.</p>
        <p>After all this abundance, main courses tend to be a letdown. The moussaka is fine, and so is Mr. Baills's cassoulet, the soul-warming composite of white beans, pork, duck confit and sausage from the south of France. It is so popular here, and so well made, that it is his Saturday night special no matter how steamy the weather. I enjoyed a special of two quartered whole quail, meaty, rich and faintly gamy, in a dense brown demi-glace strewn with black peppercorns and wild mushrooms.</p>
        <p>But other entrees seem to get less attention. Rib-eye steak is nicely beefy and accurately grilled, but its 12 French fries, stacked like Lincoln Logs, are limp. A huge fillet of salmon is dull under its thin polenta crust, a chore to eat. So is chicken cordon bleu, big, bland and breaded, a geriatric survivor of the ''Continental'' era that deserves a gold watch and a long retirement. Porcini ravioli are doughy, and their sauce is overwhelmingly rich.</p>
        <p>Beyond a bracing assortment of sorbets (pink grapefruit, green apple) and a decent creme brulee, the dessert menu has even less to recommend. Vacherin, a slab of vanilla and chocolate ice cream with a layer of raspberry sorbet, is no match for its cloying raspberry coulis. Baked crepes filled with delicious rounds of pineapple Antillaise meet the same fate: death by sweetness. Poached pears may be fresh but they taste canned, and a tarte Tatin is so sweet you can feel your molars vibrate.</p>
        <p>Decaffeinated coffee was so thin and lukewarm on our first visit that we sent it back. When we gave it another chance on a second night, the brew was the same: one part coffee, two parts tap. It was a disappointing ending to a meal begun in great promise, however familiar the territory.</p>
