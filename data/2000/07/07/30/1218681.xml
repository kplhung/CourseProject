        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Having grown up with Tom Lehrer's music and satire, Todd S. Purdum's article [''Still a Sly Wit, Now Mostly for Himself,'' July 16] gave me plenty of insights into his career and philosophy. We still own his LP's, which receive plenty of play. At the age of 8, listening to ''Songs and More Songs by Tom Lehrer'' for the first time put me into hysterics, even though some of the lyrics went over my head. I recall laughing over ''The Vatican Rag'' and singing ''Smut'' with a high school classmate. I even remember hearing a verse from ''My Home Town'' as part of my bath-time routine during my preschool years (''The guy that taught us math/ Who never took a bath/  Acquired a certain measure of renown. . . .''). I hope that an enterprising Off Off Broadway company will revive his revue, ''Tomfoolery.''</p>
