        <p>A deeply disgruntled Yasir Arafat left his base in the Gaza Strip today on a diplomatic tour aimed at solidifying international support for the Palestinians in the wake of the Camp David talks.</p>
        <p>As the Palestinian leader departed for Paris, where he was to meet President Jacques Chirac before visits to Russia and several key Arab nations, he gave vent to some of the frustration and anger that have built up among Palestinians since the Camp David talks broke up on Tuesday over the issue of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>In remarks since the talks, President Clinton and Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, have represented Mr. Arafat as the spoiler who wrecked the possibility of a wide-ranging peace agreement by rejecting American proposals for the future of the Holy City.</p>
        <p>Palestinian anger was compounded on Friday when Mr. Clinton, seeking to bolster Mr. Barak's political standing in Israel ahead of a crucial parliamentary no-confidence vote on Monday, gave an interview to Israeli television saying that Israel's flexible stance at Camp David had pushed him toward a decision to move the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Despite the Palestinian reaction, aides to Mr. Arafat said they would go ahead on Sunday with a meeting between senior Palestinian and Israeli representatives on the border of the Gaza Strip that both sides have depicted as a resumption of the peace negotiations. But with Mr. Arafat traveling and Mr. Barak fighting for political survival, officials on both sides said they expected the new talks to be brief and to avoid entanglement on the complex issue of Jerusalem. ''It's mainly just to show we're still talking,'' a senior Israeli official said.</p>
        <p>By raising the possibility of a presidential order to move the embassy from Tel Aviv, and saying he would make the decision this year, Mr. Clinton delighted the Jews and enraged the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Although largely symbolic when measured against the financial and diplomatic support the United States has given Israel since 1948, the fact that the American Embassy, along with those of most other nations, has remained in Tel Aviv has always been taken as a signal that Washington has not prejudged the future of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>At the Gaza airport, Mr. Arafat avoided direct criticism of Mr. Clinton, masking the deep dismay that aides said he had expressed privately about Mr. Clinton's remarks since the Camp David talks.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Arafat focused on the Israelis, saying that his diplomatic tour would seek to counter ''the big lies'' that had characterized Israeli accounts of Camp David.</p>
        <p>''We will put our friends and our brothers, the Arabs and the Europeans, far away from the Israeli propaganda and big lies that they are trying to put out about what happened at Camp David,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Clinton's remarks about Jerusalem were broadcast just as the Sabbath began on Friday evening, there was little formal reaction from Israeli politicians. Privately, many were delighted, although some right-wingers were critical of Mr. Clinton for intervening to help Mr. Barak win Monday's no-confidence votes in Parliament.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton used the interview to reiterate his praise of Mr. Barak after the Camp David talks, describing him as ''more creative and more courageous'' than Mr. Arafat in his readiness to accept painful compromises over Jerusalem. He said Mr. Barak had ''done everything he could to reach agreement while backing the vital interests of Israel,'' and chided Mr. Arafat for saying that the Palestinians would go ahead with a formal declaration of Palestinian statehood after Sept. 13.</p>
        <p>In the absence of any direct response from Mr. Arafat, the Palestinians made their views known through Hanan Ashrawi, who frequently acts as a spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Ms. Ashrawi told  Agence France-Presse that Mr. Clinton's remarks exposed the ''underlying American bias'' in the peace effort and added, ''It sounds like blatant political blackmail, all in the interest of Barak.'' At another point, she said that the television interview amounted to ''pandering to Barak and Clinton's domestic needs.''</p>
        <p>The Palestinian media in recent months have frequently charged that Mr. Clinton has tilted increasingly toward the Israelis in an attempt to help Hillary Rodham Clinton in her Senate election campaign in New York. The White House has ridiculed the suggestion.</p>
        <p>Hamas, the militant Islamic movement that has vigorously opposed Mr. Arafat's engagement in the peace effort, was even more strident about Mr. Clinton's remarks on moving the embassy. Mahmoud al-Zahhar, a senior Hamas aide, hinted that the group could attack American installations in the Middle East if the move went ahead.</p>
        <p>''Hamas will be the first to fight against this issue, and it's not only Hamas,'' he told Reuters. ''The entire interests of the United States will be in danger in all Islamic states. Moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would be regarded as American recognition of Israel's occupation of Jerusalem, which is a flagrant challenge to Islam.''</p>
        <p>On his tour of Europe and Arab nations, which his aides said would include Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia, and possibly other, non-Arab Muslim states, Mr. Arafat will in effect be countering an American diplomatic offensive in support of Mr. Clinton's peace proposals, and in particular the American plan for Jerusalem. That proposal would give the Palestinians limited authority in parts of East Jerusalem in return for giving up their claim to all the eastern half of the city, which was seized by Israel in the 1967 war.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, who stopped in Egypt on his way home on Wednesday, will be trying to blunt the impact of a tour beginning next week by Edward Walker, the American assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, who is a former ambassador to Israel and Egypt. The State Department announced on Friday that Mr. Walker would visit 14 countries over the next several weeks, including Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Saudi Arabia, apparently in a bid to change Arab thinking on Jerusalem. Most of the Arab reaction since Camp David, from governments and in the media, has been strongly supportive of Mr. Arafat's demand that ''all of Jerusalem'' be returned to the Palestinians in a final peace agreement.</p>
        <p>But aides to Mr. Arafat were at pains not to depict the Palestinian leader as opening a political battle with Mr. Clinton. At the Gaza airport, reporters were told that Mr. Arafat had received a private letter of ''encouragement and praise'' from Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Senior Palestinian officials urged Mr. Clinton to remain impartial. ''We hope he will remain fair in all issues relating to us,'' said Nabil Shaath, who was an adviser to Mr. Arafat at Camp David.</p>
        <p>Speaking in the West Bank town of Ramallah, he added, ''We hope that President Clinton remains as the knight of peace, who continues what he started at Camp David until we reach a just peace that goes in line with international legitimacy.''</p>
        <p>What is clear is that Mr. Barak needs all the help he can get if he is to survive as Israel's leader. A post-Camp David poll published in The Jerusalem Post on Friday suggested a new drop in his popularity, with 53 percent of the respondents saying the Israeli leader ''offered too much'' at Camp David, 11 percent saying he did not offer enough, and 28 percent saying he ''offered the right amount'' on Jerusalem and other issues.</p>
        <p>The poll also showed that a growing number of Israelis favor an election over the peace effort and would prefer a national unity government over the option Mr. Barak has pursued of reconstituting the coalition that collapsed before Camp David.</p>
        <p>Israeli political commentators said that they still expected Mr. Barak to win on Monday but that the situation was touch and go. They said much depended on whether Mr. Barak could persuade David Levy, the foreign minister, who refused to travel to Camp David, not to abandon the coalition, a step that would swing the three votes Mr. Levy controls in the 120-seat Parliament into the anti-Barak camp. Mr. Levy, sharply critical of Mr. Barak's performance at Camp David, has said he will make up his mind on Sunday.</p>
