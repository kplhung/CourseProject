        <p>Judicial system is heavily loaded against reopening of criminal cases, no matter how compelling newly discovered evidence may be; actual innocence is least effective argument to make for a new trial because it is so difficult to prove and so easy to discount, short of DNA matching, which is not a factor in most cases; photo (M)</p>

        <p>NEWLY discovered evidence may seem like the unjustly convicted's dream come true, but the reality is that such evidence rarely makes a difference in this country. Once a jury has reached a verdict or a judge has ruled, lawyers say, the odds are overwhelmingly against reopening a case, no matter how compelling the new information is.</p>
        <p>And actual innocence is the least effective argument to make for a new trial because it is so difficult to prove. Although the recent use of DNA testing, particularly in rape cases, has produced incontrovertible evidence of innocence in some cases, and has forced the release of the unjustly convicted, most crimes do not involve DNA matching. Most other types of evidence -- like confessions or new witnesses -- can be argued away or ignored, lawyers say.</p>
        <p>Judges are loath to reopen cases, and state appeals courts dislike intervening on anything but procedural issues. Decisions on who is telling the truth and what the evidence means are best left to the so-called finders of fact: the actual judge or jurors who saw the exhibits and heard the witnesses. It has always been difficult to win by taking an appeal to federal court, known as a habeas corpus petition; when Congress passed a law sharply limiting such appeals in 1996, it became even more difficult.</p>
        <p>''The chances of any petition are dim,'' said Larry W. Yackle, a law professor at Boston University. ''It would be a real indictment of the system if many were successful.'' He added, ''You wouldn't expect a system that papers over its many flaws to give up the ghost all of a sudden when it gets to a federal judge.''</p>
        <p>The bar to undoing a conviction should be high, said Nancy E. Little, a lawyer in the appeals division of the Legal Aid Society in New York. ''But the way it's applied now, it's incredibly high,'' she said. The courts ''have a vested interest in their convictions. I think it's very hard for them to undo their own work.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Little is handling an appeal in the case of David Lemus and Olmado Hidalgo, who were convicted in the 1990 murder of a bouncer at a Manhattan nightclub. Another man has since confessed to the murder and implicated a friend, but the original defendants remain in prison. Despite some corroborating evidence, a state judge in Manhattan said he did not believe the new confession and refused to order a new trial. State appeals courts refused to intervene.</p>
        <p>DESPITE the odds, Ms. Little said, she has some hope of winning a reversal through a habeas corpus petition. But the burden on the defendant is high. She must show, for instance, that the decisions of the state courts were contrary to established law, and that the state court's decision was not just incorrect, but unreasonable.</p>
        <p>It is not necessarily the job of the federal court to reexamine the facts of the case. The federal judge, in this case Jed S. Rakoff, will be looking to see whether the constitutional rights of the defendants were violated. One argument, Ms. Little said, is that the defendants' right to due process was violated when the state judge refused to grant a new trial based on the confession.</p>
        <p>Eric M. Freedman, a professor of law at Hofstra University, said it is highly unlikely that an appeal based on newly discovered evidence will succeed in federal court. Mr. Freedman, who is writing a book on habeas corpus petitions, said he knows of no recent cases in which such petitions were granted on the basis of new evidence other than possibly a few that involved exculpatory DNA testing.</p>
        <p>''The finding of facts by the state court judge must be found unreasonable,'' Mr. Freedman said, ''and they must make out a truly persuasive showing of actual innocence -- and that's tough.</p>
        <p>''The legal system tends to defer to the fact finders, whether that's a judge or a jury. There is inertia built into the legal system favoring the first finder of fact.''</p>
        <p>The best route for prisoners like Mr. Lemus and Mr. Hidalgo is to come up with new evidence that will warrant a reopening of the case in state court, Mr. Freedman said.</p>
        <p>Of course, lawyers for the two thought they had just that when they got word of the confession several years ago. Joey Pillot, a member of a Bronx extortion gang, told a federal prosecutor investigating the gang that he and his friend, James Rodriguez, had murdered the bouncer. The prosecutor and a police detective looked into Mr. Pillot's story, grilled him about the details and came to believe that he was telling the truth.</p>
        <p>But Justice Jay Gold of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who had presided over the original trial, thought Mr. Pillot had concocted the story to please the federal prosecutors, and refused to grant a new trial.</p>
        <p>NOW, lawyers for Mr. Lemus and Mr. Hidalgo need to come up with another substantial piece of new evidence to have a chance at winning a new hearing. That could be the testimony of Mr. Rodriguez, who is in prison on another charge and is to be released in November. He has said he will testify only if he gets immunity from prosecution.</p>
        <p>Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, has been reluctant to give Mr. Rodriguez complete immunity. So, Mr. Morgenthau must decide whether it is preferable to give immunity to a murderer in order to set free two possibly innocent men, or to refuse immunity and let them complete their sentences of 25 years to life. Either way, Mr. Rodriguez will walk out of prison in November.</p>
