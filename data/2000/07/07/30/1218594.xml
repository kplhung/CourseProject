      <abstract>
        <p>Randy Cohen (The Ethicist) column considers whether it is ethical to sell or give away child-safety car seat that does not meet today's standards and what to do about unpaid-for merchandise received through sales clerk's error (M)</p>

        <p>We are cleaning out our basement, selling a few yard-sale items and giving others to charity, including two child-safety car seats built five years ago. At that time, they met all safety standards, but they fall short of today's stricter standards. Is it ethical to sell them? To give them away? What if a warning is provided? --Jack Cushman, Bethesda, Md.</p>
        <p>Your intentions are honorable, but at least two of your yard-sale choices are ill advised. There is something unseemly about selling subpar baby seats to the poor (or the overly frugal): surely we don't want a society with one set of safety standards for those with money and a set of inferior standards for those without.</p>

        <p>We are cleaning out our basement, selling a few yard-sale items and giving others to charity, including two child-safety car seats built five years ago. At that time, they met all safety standards, but they fall short of today's stricter standards. Is it ethical to sell them? To give them away? What if a warning is provided? --Jack Cushman, Bethesda, Md.</p>
        <p>Your intentions are honorable, but at least two of your yard-sale choices are ill advised. There is something unseemly about selling subpar baby seats to the poor (or the overly frugal): surely we don't want a society with one set of safety standards for those with money and a set of inferior standards for those without.</p>
        <p>Giving away your car seat might remove the taint of financial gain, and providing a warning allows the recipient to make an informed decision. He's made the wrong decision, however, if he decides to use the car seats, according to Liz Neblett of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In addition to today's stricter standards, ''the Juvenile Product Manufacturers Association recommends that seats not be used after six years, and some manufacturers have adopted a five-year standard because of the possible degradation of material,'' she says. Don't be swayed by the argument that an inferior car seat is preferable to none, either. ''There are organizations in almost every state that make seats available free or at reduced prices to those who truly can't afford them,'' Neblett says.</p>
        <p>Certainly, as standards are upgraded for products, we needn't discard all of our old stuff. For example, you might ethically sell a used car that lacks air bags. But in this case the N.H.T.S.A.'s position is wise, car seats being relatively inexpensive and children being relatively fragile.</p>
        <p>One of the references I used in a job application is my former boss, whom I am now dating. We were not romantically involved while we worked together, and she says our current involvement has no bearing on the recommendation she would give me. Am I obliged to reveal our relationship to my potential employer? -Anonymous, Boston</p>
        <p>Even with a sincere determination to be punctilious, your former boss faces a conflict of interest in writing a reference for someone she has seen naked. If no one else at the old firm is in a position to write you a recommendation, then she may write it, but she should acknowledge your personal connection and leave it to your potential employer to gauge its effect on her comments. Her disclosure can be brief (''As someone I have known both personally and professionally. . . .'') and need not extol your kissable lips or that funny way you crinkle your eyes at a moment of passion.</p>
        <p>When I got home with a new drill, I discovered that the salesperson had given me a box that held three smaller boxes, each containing a drill. When I returned it, that salesperson begged me not to report him, saying: ''I have been selling them like this all day. If the boss finds out, I will be fired.''</p>
        <p>I left with three drills. He started restacking the display with single drill boxes. Did I do the right thing? -- Ronald R. Graham, Elmhurst, Ill.</p>
        <p>Not exactly. While you do not have to report the clerk to his boss -- his mistake was an honest one, and it can't be undone now -- that does not mean you get three drills for the price of one. Surely a way can be found to return two of them without costing the clerk his job. Can't he slip them back into the display? One caution: if rectifying the situation involves hiding a power drill in your pants, be insanely careful with the on-off switch.</p>
