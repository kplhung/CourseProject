        <p>Ron Schaumburg knew he was moving near a railroad track when he bought his house on Chestnut Street here 15 years ago, but it never was a problem. A train would go clanking by occasionally, and, as he puts it, ''It was a kind of pleasant sound to hear.''</p>
        <p>But all that changed recently. A surge in railroad traffic after Conrail was bought by the CSX Corporation in June 1999 has caused increased congestion. As a result, CSX has had to slip trains onto a sidetrack in a neighborhood that is both residential and commercial, where residents say they often idle for long periods.</p>
        <p>As a result, they complain, there is a constant vibration from the idling engines and a heavy cloak of diesel fuel fouling the air.</p>
        <p>''It's basically hell,'' said Mr. Schaumburg, a writer for an Internet company whose house is about 250 feet from the tracks. ''It's going on all the time. It's like having a lawn mower under your window.''</p>
        <p>Nor is Teaneck an isolated case. Other towns in Bergen County, like neighboring Bogota and Ridgefield Park -- which has been battling the Susquehanna Railroad -- have experienced the same problem, as have municipalities in other counties. And Bergen County is not alone in warring with the railroads. Kristin Carvell, a spokeswoman for Senator Robert G. Torricelli, said there are problems in Hudson, Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union Counties.</p>
        <p>Representative Steven R. Rothman, a Democrat who district embraces parts of Bergen and Hudson Counties, called idling trains ''a real problem affecting thousands of people in my district'' and vowed to  introduce legislation to enhance the rights of residents in dealing with railroads.</p>
        <p>''Both the noise and the smell of idling trains has now become a real factor in many people's lives, a factor which they had no notion would become a problem when they bought their homes,'' Mr. Rothman said.</p>
        <p>As things stand now, local communities have little control over what railroads do within their borders. Mr. Rothman's bill, if enacted, would require notification and public hearings before a railroad constructed such additions as a siding, spur or engine repair shop.</p>
        <p>He said in a telephone interview that his bill would also direct the secretary of transportation to hold public hearings nationwide to explore ''the extent and impact of the noise and diesel fuel problem as they affect people near the tracks'' and then report those findings to Congress with recommendations on ''how to strike the right balance'' between accommodating the needs of the railroad industry and quality of life of residents.</p>
        <p>Last month, Senator Torricelli attached a rider to the Senate transportation appropriations bill calling on the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a yearlong study of the effect of idling trains on safety, quality of life and the environment.</p>
        <p>The prospects of the two measures being enacted and nudging the federal bureaucracy that has long regulated the railroads and interstate commerce cannot be gauged, in part because there is no precedent.</p>
        <p>Thomas White, a spokesman for the Association of American Railroads, a trade association in Washington, which represents railroads in the United States, Canada and Mexico, said, ''I've never heard of anything like this being proposed before.''</p>
        <p>CSX, which, along with Norfolk Southern Corporation, took over tracks and equipment owned by Conrail in June 1999, said it had tried to be as accommodating as possible. Over the last year, company officials have met with officials of Teaneck and Bogota -- its neighbor to the south -- to find a location for trains to stop that would affect the fewest people and finally settled on a stretch south of the Cedar Lane bridge to Terhune Street.</p>
        <p>''This was the best compromise,'' said Mike Brimmer, regional vice president for state and local government relations for CSX. ''There is no perfect solution.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, residents have complained that some trains have idled and rumbled on the siding for 12 and 15 hours at a stretch. As a result, Mr. Brimmer said crews had been directed to shut down if they knew they would be delayed for more than two hours. At the same time, he pointed out that once a train was shut down it took an hour and a half to start the engine again, pump up the air pressure in the brakes and conduct a safety inspection.</p>
        <p>Last month, at a hearing in Teaneck, CSX officials said a long-term solution could be  the construction of a second track from northern Teaneck to Jersey City -- a distance of 16 miles -- that would allow trains to pass one another more easily and decrease the need to pull trains over on a siding.</p>
        <p>But construction, which would cost $15 million and include building some bridges over tracks, would not be completed for two years. Some officials, like Steven M. Lonegan, the mayor of Bogota, said he feared such a solution would only intensify congestion by creating what he called a mini-rail yard. Bogota filed a suit to block construction, charging it violated federal environmental regulations, but last fall a federal judge in Newark ruled against the borough.</p>
        <p>The line CSX uses has only one track from Jersey City to Albany with a limited number of sidings along the way where a train, sometimes a mile to a mile and a half long, can pull over to let another pass. One of them is the three-mile stretch through Teaneck and Bogota.</p>
        <p>At first, CSX began putting trains in Bogota, but idling trains soon drew the ire of people who lived in apartments and housing for the elderly a hundred feet from the tracks. At one point, Mayor Lonegan, accompanied by the police, boarded an idling train and handed a $75 summons to the engineer charging violation of the noise ordinance.</p>
        <p>Even though railroads have been exempt from municipal laws in the past under interstate commerce regulations, Mayor Lonegan said, ''They arrived with a battery of high-priced lawyers.'' He added, ''If I won, everybody would be doing it.''</p>
        <p>A municipal court judge threw the ticket out when CSX agreed to put the trains elsewhere. That turned out to be Teaneck which has two and a half miles of side track to Bogota's half-mile and, unlike Bogota, has no street-level grade crossings.</p>
        <p>Mayor Lonegan said he asked Teaneck officials to join in a suit to block construction of the second track but they declined.</p>
        <p>Mayor Paul Ostrow said a lawsuit was expensive with little chance of winning but that the township was keeping its options open.</p>
        <p>''In this case, you catch more flies with honey,'' Mayor Ostrow said. ''In my opinion, they have tried to address the problem as best as the circumstances allow. But we're still not satisfied.'' He added Teaneck was ''between a rock and a hard place.''</p>
        <p>Fewer trains have been idling recently and the situation has improved somewhat in recent weeks, Mr. Schaumburg said. But he and his neighbors are still unhappy with the compromise reached by the town and CSX.</p>
        <p>Jeff Pickens, the owner of a delivery company who lives next to Mr. Schaumburg, said some people were giving up and putting up for sale signs.</p>
        <p>''That's a shame,'' said Mr. Pickens. ''We're letting the train take over our lives. We had a great community here.''</p>
