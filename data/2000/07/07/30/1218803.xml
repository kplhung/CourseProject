        <p>DRESSED in a pink tutu with double-decker wings, Todd Susman and his grouchy persona are trying to change the image of the tooth fairy forever.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Susman, a 53-year-old actor, the offbeat role in ads for Sonicare electric toothbrushes is an opportunity to play a memorable personality like Mr. Whipple, the vigilant grocery-store manager of the Charmin commercials, and Clara, who asked ''Where's the Beef?'' for the Wendy's fast-food chain.</p>
        <p>But with a strike by commercial actors against advertisers and agencies entering its 14th week, Mr. Susman will not be shooting new commercials for Sonicare, which is made by Optiva, as scheduled. Although he knows that the character, and the advertising campaign, could be jeopardized, he said the risk was ultimately worth it.</p>
        <p>''Advertisers want to change the status quo forever,'' he said. ''They have the money. They have the resolution, and if they can possibly do it they will.''</p>
        <p>As the strike stretches on, it appears to be more and more a sign of things to come. Movie and television production are already being accelerated as Hollywood prepares for the possibility of strikes by screen and television actors as well as writers when their contracts expire next year.</p>
        <p>In a recent newsletter, the Writers Guild of America warned its members: ''Now is not the time to be buying the biggest house or the nicest car you can afford. If you have a TV staff-writing job, begin putting money away now. If you make a feature deal, bank every penny you can.''</p>
        <p>The writers and actors share a key complaint, about their pay for work shown on cable TV. In the early days of cable, union representatives say, actors and writers cut special deals below network rates to help the fledgling industry get off the ground. Now, they say, it's time for payback. ''Cable has become a mature cash cow industry, very successful,'' said John McLean, executive director of the Writers Guild of America, West. ''And we want our piece.''</p>
        <p>More broadly, the disputes arise from the changing face of television and the multitude of options created by advances in electronic media, including the Internet. Compensation for work shown on the Internet is another issue in the contract talks.</p>
        <p>''We're in a whole new world here; we'll agree with them on that,'' said Todd Amorde, chairman of the national strike strategy committee for the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.</p>
        <p>For decades, television was dominated by the three major networks -- ABC, NBC and CBS. Now, there are seven broadcast networks and at least 50 national cable networks that are tracked by Nielsen Media Research, plus many regional channels that are not even monitored. Until the late 1970's, the three big broadcast networks captured more than 90 percent of the viewing audience. That share is now less than 50 percent.</p>
        <p>''It's basically a different economic model,'' said Tim Brooks, co-author of an annual directory of prime-time network and cable shows. ''You get this collision of interests as times change.''</p>
        <p>The Writers Guild's contract with producers expires May 1 next year, followed by the movie and television actors contracts July 1. No proposals are yet on the table. But union representatives said they want compensation for the increasing profitability of cable and of shows that are broadcast overseas. They also want a guarantee of fair pay for work that appears on the Internet.</p>
        <p>In the strike by actors in commercials, the primary difference is simple: the actors want to be paid every time an ad is shown on television, and advertising agencies and marketers want to pay a flat rate.</p>
        <p>On network television, actors who appear in commercials are paid under a system known as ''pay for play.'' They receive a daily rate, currently $478.70, which includes the first broadcast. They are then paid each time the commercial is shown again, starting at $122.70 and decreasing over 13 weeks to $46.65. On cable, they are paid $1,014 for the 13-week cyle, no matter how many times the commercial is shown.</p>
        <p>A commercial runs an average of 44 times over 13 weeks on the networks, according to Mr. Amorde. On cable, with more channels and lower costs for time, he said,  advertisers have told him that commercials run 225 to 233 times over 13 weeks. But he says the Screen Actors Guild has found some ads that were shown as many as 5,000 times on cable.</p>
        <p>Though actors usually spend only a day or two shooting a commercial, they spend much more time searching for assignments and auditioning. Apart from celebrities, the most successful actors who specialize in commercials can earn more than $50,000 in a good year. But most make just a few thousand dollars and rely on other jobs for most of their income.</p>
        <p>Unions representing commercial actors have proposed a pay-for-play arrangement for cable at 37 percent of the network rate.</p>
        <p>The Joint Policy Committee, representing advertisers and their agencies, has proposed to increase the payment for filming a commercial to $500, followed by a flat rate of $2,575 for 13 weeks of appearances on network TV. On cable, they have proposed increasing the rate for 13 weeks to $1,627.</p>
        <p>Agreeing on these terms is essential before the negotiators start dealing with new technologies, said John A. McGuinn, chief negotiator for the Joint Policy Committee. ''This strike is about modernizing this contract and bringing it into the Year 2000 so we can deal with the Internet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>NEGOTIATORS have been finding little common ground. The talks, which had been suspended, resumed on July 20 after federal mediators called the two groups back to the table. But the negotiations quickly broke down again.</p>
        <p>Actors want Internet use of advertising included in the contract, but Mr. McGuinn said he had not been authorized to negotiate in this area. The advertisers and agencies  want both sides to study the issue and meet at least once a year, but they stress that they do not agree that the unions have a right to negotiate Internet rates.</p>
        <p>A third sticking point involves the unions' desire to verify how many times a commercial is shown. The Screen Actors Guild says its survey of 38 commercials uncovered $110,000 in unpaid wages. The advertising industry proposes joining with the unions to choose a consultant who can search for the best way to monitor commercials. Recommendations from a committee representing both sides would be due 60 days before the expiration of a new contract in 2003.</p>
        <p>Some advertisers are producing commercials with the blessing of the actors unions by agreeing to pay what the unions have proposed. But many other commercials are being made in defiance of the strike.</p>
        <p>The unions, affiliates of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., are trying to keep the heat on advertisers. Members are picketing production of nonunion commercials in an attempt to shut them down. Earlier this month, the actors picketed major offices of AT&amp;T, which has been making commercials using nonunion actors.</p>
        <p>In New York, the protesters were addressed by labor leaders, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, John J. Sweeney, and by actors like Susan Sarandon and Jerry Orbach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Susman said he had been lucky enough to work during the strike by providing the voice of a dog in commercials for Laidlaw's Greyhound bus line, which signed the unions' proposed contract. Still, he marvels that commercial actors, among the hardest-working and lowest-paid members of the actors' unions, are bearing the brunt of the larger struggle. ''How God and luck aligned in this particular situation so that we are the ones at the forefront of this fight, I will never know,'' Mr. Susman said. ''But we know the fight we're in.''</p>
