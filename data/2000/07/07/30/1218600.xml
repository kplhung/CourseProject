        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article ''The Felling of 4 Trees Removes a Familiar Presence'' [Streetscapes, June 18] made me personally very sad.</p>
        <p>I had the pleasure of living in that house at Madison and 84th Street from 1968 through 1971. We occupied the third and fourth floors, and one of those trees reached the fourth-floor kitchen window on the east side of the building. It was a beautiful tree that shaded the kitchen and was the home for a variety of city birds, which we watched each day.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article ''The Felling of 4 Trees Removes a Familiar Presence'' [Streetscapes, June 18] made me personally very sad.</p>
        <p>I had the pleasure of living in that house at Madison and 84th Street from 1968 through 1971. We occupied the third and fourth floors, and one of those trees reached the fourth-floor kitchen window on the east side of the building. It was a beautiful tree that shaded the kitchen and was the home for a variety of city birds, which we watched each day.</p>
        <p>Our son, who was 2 at the time, to my horror threw a broom out the kitchen window. Expecting the worst, I looked out, and there it was, nestled in the branches of this wonderful old tree. We talk about it to this day.</p>
        <p>Fearing that it would drop to the ground and hurt a passerby, I notified the Parks Department, and they promptly recovered the broom.</p>
        <p>People who have no regard for trees that lived there long before they did -- and thankfully, with the exception of those four beautiful trees, will remain long after they are gone -- should go live in the desert among the cactus.</p>
