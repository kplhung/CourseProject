        <p>Leonard Glickman letter responds to July 23 editorial on immigration; recommends goal of admitting 100,000 of world's estimated 14 million refugees in 2001</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>One element often left out of the discussion of immigration (editorial, July 23) is refugee admissions. Our country was founded as a haven for those fleeing persecution. But with the end of the cold war, refugees seem to be dropping off the political radar.</p>
        <p>The number of refugees, however,  remains very high, approximately 14 million worldwide. Sadly, this year fewer than 75,000 will be admitted to the United States. In 1992, more than 132,000 refugees arrived.</p>

        <p>Restoring due process to the persecuted and opening wider our gateway to them should be at the top of the agenda of our next president. Our goal should be to admit at least 100,000 refugees next year, thereby approaching the levels of the early 1990's.</p>
