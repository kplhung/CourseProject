        <p>SINCE the day I began piecing together what happened, I have thought about her often, this woman who used my identity to obtain a credit card. Did she buy disposable diapers or expensive perfume? Was she desperate or greedy? Did she work alone or as part of some nefarious gang?</p>
        <p>I am untangling myself from the creepy web of something called identity fraud. It happens when a criminal uses personal information like your Social Security number or date of birth to fraudulently open accounts in your name.</p>
        <p>It is a growing crime that is pulled off in any number of ways, from taking information off the Internet, stealing it from a wallet, or buying it from a sales clerk, according to the police, lawyers and consumer advocates. Identity theft will happen thousands of times in New York this year, they say, and maybe 500,000 times nationwide.</p>
        <p>The ease of the fraud makes it difficult to stop. As I wrote Citibank and the credit bureaus, filed a police report and talked to bill collectors, I had the weird sensation of seeing myself through their eyes.</p>
        <p>If someone represents themselves as you, how do you prove who you are? You want to scream: This is my real address, this is my Social Security number, I am so much more than this collection of numbers and unflattering ID photographs.</p>
        <p>I do not not know how my identity was stolen. We engage in many acts of trust each day, from using an A.T.M. to renting a video. All involve an information exchange that can be turned to our disadvantage.</p>
        <p>''New York is a particularly bad place to have your identity stolen,'' said James Fishman, a Manhattan lawyer who has handled dozens of identity fraud cases. ''Think about a large apartment house. You have a large number of people with the same address and, if you have a common name, maybe the same name. It does not require an exact match for credit reports to merge.''</p>
        <p>I endured weeks of frustrating telephone messages before I pinned down why Citibank was calling. I never had an account there. I initially assumed the telephone messages, which simply left a 800 number, were annoying calls from telemarketers.</p>
        <p>When I called back, I was enmeshed in the Catch-22 of people over the telephone reading the last four digits of my Social Security number and refusing more information until I gave them my entire number, which I refused to do for fear of fraud.</p>
        <p>The last straw was the night a bill collector called my home. He had information about me that some of my best friends do not have. My credit was good, he said, except for this credit card thing.</p>
        <p>The next morning, I marched into a Citibank branch and asked to speak to a real person. I was directed to an automated telephone, where I was forced to do an information strip: mother's maiden name, date of birth, Social Security number.</p>
        <p>I finally found out that the bank had issued a credit card in my name to an unfamiliar address in the Bronx (a borough where I have never lived). Still, to receive and fill out an official fraud report, I had to call yet another 800 number and strip again.</p>
        <p>Maria Mendler, a spokeswoman for Citibank, said the company is an industry leader in fighting credit card fraud. She said Citibank was one of the first companies, for instance, to require customers to activate credit cards they receive by mail.</p>
        <p>As I sat in a little two-desk room in the 24th Precinct station house on the Upper West Side, the woman at the other desk that morning had a similar story. Fraudulent mail-order charges had shown up on her Citibank credit card. In her case it was a legitimate account and Citibank was able to tip her off about what it called ''unusual activity.''</p>
        <p>''We see a lot of it,'' said Detective Antonio Fernandez of the 24th Precinct, who was assigned to me and the mail-order lady. ''I've seen it increase. To investigate this is difficult. It takes time and it's a paper chase.''</p>
        <p>I learned the drill the hard way:</p>
        <p>* If you suspect fraud, you must file a written claim of fraudulent activity with the businesses involved.</p>
        <p>* Get in touch with the three main credit card bureaus in writing. They are Experian (888-397-3742), Trans Union (800-916-8800) and Equifax (800-685-1111). Explain what happened. Ask for a copy of your credit report. Request that a fraud alert be placed in your file. Ask that creditors notify you in writing if anyone attempts to open an account in your name.</p>
        <p>* Send all correspondence by return receipt certified mail.</p>
        <p>* Check your credit report for fraud or errors every four months or so.</p>
        <p>* Go to the police. If possible, take something in writing with an account number and your notification of fraudulent activity.</p>
        <p>* Try to determine what personal information was used. You can change passwords and even your Social Security number if necessary.</p>
        <p>* If a credit bureau or a bank persists in reporting erroneous information about you, they can be liable.</p>
