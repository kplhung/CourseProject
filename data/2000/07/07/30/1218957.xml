        <p>LOUKA, an unmarried 55-year-old cellist in Prague who looks a bit like Sean Connery, is down on his luck. Otherwise he would never have agreed to a fake marriage to help a Russian woman get her Czech papers. In the exquisitely made KOLYA (1996), Louka (Zdenek Sverak) gets the 40,000 crowns he was promised and more. The bride promptly runs away to Germany, leaving her 5-year-old son, Kolya (Andrej Chalimon), behind. Louka has no intention of playing father (it interferes with his active love life, for one thing), but he's stuck. What could have been a sticky-sweet tale of an adorable child transforming a grumpy old man is a gentle but thoroughly unsentimental gem of a movie. Mr. Sverak wrote ''Kolya,'' which won the best foreign film Oscar; Jan Sverak, his son, directed - Thursday at 10 p.m. and Thursday/Early Friday at 3:35 and 11:45 A.M. on IFC.</p>

        <p>LOUKA, an unmarried 55-year-old cellist in Prague who looks a bit like Sean Connery, is down on his luck.

        <p>Sometimes the critics get it right. When CITIZEN KANE (1941) opened, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called it ''far and away the most surprising and cinematically exciting motion picture to be seen here in many a moon.'' In fact, he added, ''it comes close to being the most sensational film ever made in Hollywood.'' Almost 60 years later, it's regarded as just that. Orson Welles, at the tender age of 26, produced, directed, starred in and wrote (with Herman J. Mankiewicz) the story of Charles Foster Kane, a soulless newspaper mogul based on William Randolph Hearst. Despite the acclaim, the film won only one Academy Award, for its screenplay. Sometimes the academy gets it wrong - Wednesday at midnight on TCM.</p>
        <p>A convenience-store robber and a police photographer fall in love (he's a repeat offender, so she gets to do his mug shot several times) and marry. When they learn they can't have babies, they decide to steal one. Surely that unpainted-furniture tycoon whose wife recently had quintuplets wouldn't mind if they took just one. Holly Hunter and Nicolas Cage are the oblivious lovers in RAISING ARIZONA (1987). The Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, did this highly original caper film between ''Blood Simple'' and ''Miller's Crossing'' - Thursday at 8 p.m. and Friday at 4 p.m. on Comedy Central.</p>
        <p>For movie fans who can't get enough of Mr. Cage in over-the-top mode, there in MOONSTRUCK (1987), Norman Jewison's glorious romantic comedy about an Italian-American family in Brooklyn. Cher won the best actress Oscar for her role as Loretta Castorini, a drab young widow who doesn't expect much of love or marriage the next time around. Mr. Cage is the passionate, opera-loving one-handed baker who changes her mind, even though she's engaged to his brother (Danny Aiello). Olympia Dukakis is completely irresistible (she won the best supporting actress Oscar) as Loretta's wise, emotion-weary mother - Saturday at 8 p.m. on TNT.</p>
        <p>Even those of us who consider disco a punishment from hell get nostalgic over some of the Bee Gees songs from Jon Badham's SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER (1977). Maybe because they remind us of John Travolta as Tony Manero, a young working-class Brooklynite still living with his parents and with nothing to look forward to but decades of meaningless jobs like the one he has now at a paint store. And his weekend nights dancing at the 2001 Odyssey disco in Bay Ridge. No matter how many times we've seen it parodied - white suit, raised arm, glittering disco lights - Mr. Travolta gives the film a fierce energy that demands respect - Sunday at 5 p.m. on Channel 11.</p>
