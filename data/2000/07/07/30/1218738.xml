        <p>AS a child, Sue Zesiger slept on a red pillow shaped like a Ferrari. While many of her young friends loved perfume, she always preferred the smell of gasoline.

        <p>Ms. Zesiger, 36, still loves cars, especially very fast ones. A senior editor and the main reviewer of high-performance vehicles for Fortune magazine, she's rarely in her office. More often, she can be found test-driving a Ferrari on curvy back roads in Italy, racing snowmobiles or attending the introduction of a new Audi coupe. ''She's a hot mama,'' Shelly Branch, a friend, said. ''She loves fast cars, and she dresses in couture all the time.''</p>

        <p>AS a child, Sue Zesiger slept on a red pillow shaped like a Ferrari. While many of her young friends loved perfume, she always preferred the smell of gasoline. ''Ever since I was a little girl, I've loved cars,'' she said. ''When I was 8, my mother caught me trying to saw the wheels off her vacuum cleaner to build my own car.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Zesiger, 36, still loves cars, especially very fast ones. A senior editor and the main reviewer of high-performance vehicles for Fortune magazine, she's rarely in her office. More often, she can be found test-driving a Ferrari on curvy back roads in Italy, racing snowmobiles or attending the introduction of a new Audi coupe. ''She's a hot mama,'' Shelly Branch, a friend, said. ''She loves fast cars, and she dresses in couture all the time.''</p>
        <p>She's also comfortable covered in car grease. On her free weekends, Ms. Zesiger races go-carts, which she drives lying down like a bobsledder. ''I like thrills,'' she said. ''When I'm on the track, I can truly clear my mind. For me, it's the most peaceful place. It's Zen.''</p>
        <p>In the summer of 1998, she met Reeves Callaway, the founder of Callaway Cars in Old Lyme, Conn., when he introduced the C12, a 440-horsepower, custom-made high-performance car that costs about $180,000. Mr. Callaway, 52 and a son of the golf-club designer Ely Callaway, is soft spoken, artistic and meticulous, a lover of clean engines, spotless offices and efficiency.</p>
        <p>His press agent scheduled an interview for him with Ms. Zesiger in her office, to discuss the C12. ''I walked in and took two looks at Sue, and this little movie started playing in my mind, this little vision of some time in the future,'' Mr. Callaway, who had been divorced, said. ''It was something very domestic, Sue and I sitting around a fireplace with kids running around.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Zesiger, who has also been divorced, did not have any visions of domestic bliss but liked him right away. ''He came in and I thought, Oh, you're not what I expected,'' she recalled. ''I expected someone with grease under his nails, brilliant about cars but that was it. He went to Amherst, he was an art major. I had never met a car guy like him.''</p>
        <p>Weeks later, they got together in Bridgehampton, N.Y., where she rented a racetrack to test-drive the C12. ''She could drive the wheels off a car!'' Mr. Callaway said. ''She loved how cars felt, how they worked. I'd never met a woman before who understood that unspoken stuff.''</p>
        <p>Afterward, they went out for sushi. Soon, they were dating so seriously that for the first time in her life Ms. Zesiger wanted to slow down. ''It was going so quickly, and I felt one of us had to be a brake,'' she said. So, they took a hiatus from dating for a few months, which only made them fall even more in love, she said.</p>
        <p>After she accepted Mr. Callaway's marriage proposal last February, more than a few men in the automotive world reportedly went into mourning. ''She went to some car event a few months ago, and when the guys heard she was engaged, they showed up wearing black arm bands,'' Ms. Branch said.</p>
        <p>On July 15, the couple were married near Rowayton, Conn., on a small island just off the coast owned by the bride's father and stepmother, Al and Barrie Zesiger. Battleship-gray motorboats (designed to break ice in the winter) ferried guests to the four-acre island. The wedding was held on the porch of the Tudor-style house, which is as meticulous as a Callaway engine and filled with oversize furniture -- armchairs shaped like enormous pin cushions, tables fashioned out of tree trunks.</p>
        <p>Several wedding guests wondered if marriage might inspire Ms. Zesiger to race around less. That doesn't seem likely. ''I've always hated the stereotype that marriage is a bummer,'' the bride said. ''I am so excited about what my future with Reeves holds. We have so many great dreams -- I can hardly wait. We want to have children and businesses together. We are both ready for action.''</p>
