        <p>LAST year, I renewed one of my first loves and learned to enjoy growing zinnias again.</p>
        <p>My attention was drawn to them when I saw a fine border of the new Profusion zinnias growing under a sunny blue sky. I immediately sought out some plants of my own to grow had great success in my garden.</p>
        <p>These new zinnias were the All-America Selections winners for the year, a coveted prize awarded each year as a result of a national judging program of the American seed trade. The prize-winning zinnias were announced in two colors: cherry and orange. I found the cherry color a bit hard to combine with other annuals, but the orange-flowered sort was an easy addition.</p>
        <p>This zinnia is now a listed item in seed catalogs and can be ordered and grown every year. It is the sort of plant that thrives and blooms no matter what the summer weather has to supply. Last summer had everything: drought, heat, humidity.</p>
        <p>Profusion zinnias are great mounding plants in that they grow to about a foot or so in height with strong, sturdy stems. They are so floriferous, the plants are covered with blooms, in fact, smothered might be a better word.</p>
        <p>And one of the best assets of the Profusions is that they exhibit resistance to mildew. Mildew fungus can be a serious problem with most zinnias especially if the summer is humid and the plants are spaced so they grow rather tightly together with little air circulation.</p>
        <p>My success last year with this dandy zinnia was a wake-up call to renew my acquaintance with this old garden reliable. The best part about zinnias is that they are so easy to grow. Just set the seed in the ground as soon as the weather is settled and the soil warm. The seed germinates quickly and seedlings start to grow in about a week. As to its soil requirements, they are somewhat minimal. Average, well-drained garden soil is fine. The plants can even grow fairly well where the ground is quite rocky. Watering and fertilizing too much  will tend to push growth at the expense of blooms. Also, zinnias are not plants for shady nooks. A place in full sun is best, where plants can bask in the heat of the day.</p>
        <p>An important pointer on success with zinnias. These plants are native to Mexico. As a result, they supply typical Mexican flower colors in rich oranges, bright reds, yellows, gold and white. The plant breeders have worked so well with these flowers that there now are green-flowered zinnias and one spectacular two--color version called Peppermint Stick.</p>
        <p>The green-colored zinnia, called Envy, has been described in one seed catalog as having Granny Smith green flowers. The types of flowers are remarkable, too. Some resemble dahlias. Some are shaggy suggesting cactuses. Others are petite while some are many colored suggesting a Persian carpet, which is also a name of one particular sort.</p>
        <p>For the most part, the standard type of zinnia that seems to please is  the species Zinnia elegans. Most of the tall and large-flowered sorts can be found in this group. Some of the plants can grow to three feet with flowers four to five inches across.</p>
        <p>Quite popular as well are the so-called Mexican zinnias (Z. haageana) which have splashy two-toned flowers. This is where the well-known Persian Carpet cultivar belongs. Perhaps the most beguiling of all are the smaller, spreading zinnias with the linear foliage. These belong to the species Z. angustifolia or some still refer to it as Z. linearis. These are somewhat spreading plants with smaller flowers, about an inch wide. Their colors are quieter in subdued pinks and creams.</p>
        <p>One wonderful characteristic of zinnias is that they are superb cut flowers. Just be sure to cut them off with a sharp scissors and immediately plunk them in cool deep water. The blooms last easily for a week.  Cutting them also keeps the plants blooming all summer. The more the plants are cut, the more they will  bloom.</p>
        <p>Also, just to keep the plants looking their best. It is important to cut off the faded flowers if you can't get around to cutting them for indoors.</p>
        <p>The faded flowers make the plants look untidy. Otherwise, seed will start to develop soon.</p>
        <p>As is often the case with many well-known garden plants, their names can usually be traced to commemorate some important person or place.</p>
        <p>In the case of zinnia, the genus name gives recognition to Johann Gottfried Zinn who was a noted professor of medicine in Gottingen, Germany. He died in 1759, but his namesake lives on to the delight of many satisfied gardeners.</p>
