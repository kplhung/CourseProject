        <p>This summer and fall, fans of Dr. Seuss can attend an exhibition of his work without a single taste of green eggs and ham. Through Oct. 16, ''The Political Dr. Seuss'' assembles about 50 of his political cartoons at the Connecticut Valley Historical Museum in Springfield, Mass., the city where he was born and grew up.</p>
        <p>The exhibition draws strongly from ''Dr. Seuss Goes to War: The World War II Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel,'' a 1999 book by Dr. Richard H. Minear, a professor of history at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst who is the guest curator of the exhibition. Some of the cartoons were done for the liberal New York daily PM from 1941 to 1943, many of them vehement -- and occasionally racist -- attacks on Hitler and the Japanese.</p>

        <p>This summer and fall, fans of Dr. Seuss can attend an exhibition of his work without a single taste of green eggs and ham. Through Oct. 16, ''The Political Dr. Seuss'' assembles about 50 of his political cartoons at the Connecticut Valley Historical Museum in Springfield, Mass., the city where he was born and grew up.</p>
        <p>The exhibition draws strongly from ''Dr. Seuss Goes to War: The World War II Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel,'' a 1999 book by Dr. Richard H. Minear, a professor of history at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst who is the guest curator of the exhibition. Some of the cartoons were done for the liberal New York daily PM from 1941 to 1943, many of them vehement -- and occasionally racist -- attacks on Hitler and the Japanese.</p>
        <p>Dr. Minear points out that Dr. Seuss' children's books often contain serious themes: ''Yertle the Turtle'' is a cautionary tale against dictators, and ''The Butter Battle Book'' satirizes the Cold War. The drawings in the exhibit often contain striking resemblances to some of Dr. Seuss' later well-known characters, including a prototype of Yertle, which Dr. Seuss once said represented Hitler.</p>
        <p>The Connecticut Valley Historical Museum is on the Quadrangle, at State and Chestnut Streets. It is open noon to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday (also Tuesday in August). Admission, $4; $1 for ages 6 to 18. Information: (413) 263-6800.</p>
