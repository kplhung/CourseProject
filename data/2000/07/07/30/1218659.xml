        <p>AS a gay couple, Greg Cartagine and Reed Chaikin of Stamford had done everything they could to provide security for their 3-year-old son, Travis. They made wills, took out extra insurance on each other, went through probate court and were approved by a child placement agency, which enabled Mr. Cartagine, the nonbiological parent, to become Travis's legal guardian, along with Mr. Chaikin, the boy's biological father.</p>

        <p>AS a gay couple, Greg Cartagine and Reed Chaikin of Stamford had done everything they could to provide security for their 3-year-old son, Travis. They made wills, took out extra insurance on each other, went through probate court and were approved by a child placement agency, which enabled Mr. Cartagine, the nonbiological parent, to become Travis's legal guardian, along with Mr. Chaikin, the boy's biological father.</p>
        <p>But until a bill passed in Connecticut's last legislative session allowing for second parent adoption, Mr. Cartagine's rights -- and Travis's security -- were limited.</p>
        <p>The new law will allow gay and heterosexual couples who are not married to have the nonbiological parent adopt his or her partner's child. That can happen only after the noncustodial parent, for example a sperm donor or biological mother,  gives up parental rights.</p>
        <p>In practice, the law will benefit mostly gay and lesbian couples. For the adoption to proceed, a probate judge must rule that it is in the best interests of the child.</p>
        <p>Gov. John G. Rowland signed the bill in June and it will go into effect on Oct. 1. A similar bill died last year after opponents tacked on a Defense  of Marriage Act amendment, specifying that marriage in Connecticut must be between a man and a woman. This year a similar amendment was proposed, but didn't come up for a vote because compromise language was added to the bill that says ''the current public policy of the state of Connecticut is now limited to a marriage between a man and a woman.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cartagine and Mr. Chaikin, who have been partners for 15 years, were part of a grass-roots coalition of individuals and 30 organizations, called Love Makes a Family, convened by the Connecticut Coalition for Gay Rights and the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the bill met with legislators, invited them into their homes and introduced them to their families. Backers said it was this personal approach that convinced many legislators to vote in favor of the bill.</p>
        <p>''I said it was a children's rights issue, and it was,'' Mr. Cartagine said. ''As a father, I wanted to provide the best for my child. I did not want to have him ever hear me have to explain that I am not his parent.''</p>
        <p>Both Democrats and Republicans  supported the bill. Representative Chris DePino, Republican of New Haven and chairman of the state Republican Party, spoke in favor of the bill on the floor of the House. On the other hand, several Democrats joined some Republicans in opposition.</p>
        <p>Representative John Wayne Fox, Democrat of Stamford, voted against the bill. He said he was concerned that legalizing protections for gay and lesbian parents could open the door to gay marriage, or at least legal civil union, as legislators in Vermont recently voted to do.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Fox said, he was gratified that language in the bill stated that current public policy in Connecticut limits marriage to a man and a woman. ''As amended, the bill was significantly improved,'' he said, but added that to the extent that heterosexual couples took advantage of it, it created ''an inherent disincentive for them to get married. It works against marriage and that's why I voted against it.''</p>
        <p>Maureen Murphy, a New Haven lawyer, said the marriage statutes in Connecticut are gender-neutral, and it is the statutes themselves that would have to be changed -- through a Defense of Marriage Act -- to ban gay marriage. But, she emphasized, the law just passed was not about gay and lesbian marriage, but rather about protecting children.</p>
        <p>Della Schmid-Woodworth and Sue Tharnish-Woodworth of New Haven lobbied for the bill. They have been raising Ms. Tharnish-Woodworth's  three nephews, ages 11, 12 and 13, for the past three years. Last November, Ms. Schmid-Woodworth had a baby girl, Emma, whom her partner is co-parenting. They had taken steps similar to Mr. Cartagine and Mr. Chaikin to create as secure a family unit as was possible before the bill passed.  Their state representative, Cameron Staples, and State Senator Martin Looney supported the bill.</p>
        <p>Connecticut becomes the 23rd state to allow second-parent adoptions, joining all the states that border it. Ms. Schmid-Woodworth said she knew of other couples who had moved out of state to get that legal protection. She added that she and her partner had thought of doing so, but decided against it because it would have disrupted their lives, especially with the three boys in school.</p>
        <p>''It feels comforting to know Emma will be fine if anything happens to me,'' said Ms. Schmid-Woodward. ''That's something you take for granted if you are a heterosexual couple.''</p>
        <p>In addition to gay couples and the larger gay rights and civil rights constituencies, some in the religious community supported the bill. The Rev. Kathleen McTigue, minister of the Unitarian Society of New Haven in Hamden, said she was appalled to learn that the Defense of Marriage Act proposed last year called for fining clergy who performed same-sex unions. ''I was so offended by that blatant intrusion into church  business,'' she said, ''I really felt that something needed to be done.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McTigue and Rabbi Sonya Starr, formerly of Congregation Mishkan Israel in Hamden, pulled together more than a hundred members of the clergy from throughout Connecticut to support the second parent adoption bill and to defeat the Defense of Marriage Act proposal in this year's session. Clergy included Jews, Unitarian Universalists, Buddhists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Lutherans, United Methodists and members of the United Church of Christ.</p>
        <p>''In Judaism, one of the central points is the protection of our children,'' Rabbi Starr said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Murphy said she represents more than 50 Connecticut couples who are interested in second-parent adoption. Most of them are lesbian couples in which one of the partners has had a baby through artificial insemination, and in which the biological father has already relinquished his rights to the child. In cases of adoption, before the new law, only one of the partners could legally adopt, thus leaving the other partner in legal limbo.</p>
        <p>She said she knows of many cases where lesbian couples have split up and the partner who was not legally the child's mother had very little legal recourse. ''I represented the first case in Connecticut of a lesbian seeking parental rights after she broke up with the child's mother,'' Ms. Murphy said. ''The court gave my client very generous visitation, but even though she wanted to pay child support, the court could not order that because she had no standing as a parent.''</p>
        <p>With the new law, the second parent may adopt his or her partner's child, with all the privileges and responsibilities that entails, said Ms. Murphy. If the couple separates, they must go through family court to deal with issues of child custody, visitation and support.</p>
        <p>She said that before the new law, probate courts were often unwilling to terminate a noncustodial parent's rights, even if that parent was absent or in some other way not a good parent, using the argument that a deficient parent was better than none, especially if something happened to the primary parent. But under the new law, second parents who have been waiting to adopt their partners' children will be able to do so, making courts more willing to terminate parental rights of biological, but absent parents.</p>
        <p>''This is a huge victory for our families,'' Ms. Murphy said. ''I'm  glad they are going to be able to solidify their legal relationship with their children.''</p>
