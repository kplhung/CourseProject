        <p>LOWER MANHATTAN  Artists Whose Medium Is Puppets</p>
        <p>''Sticks, Rags and Strings: The Art of Contemporary Puppetry'' displays the work of four artists at the World Financial Center. One, Dan Hurlin, has created a miniature proscenium animated by paper cutout characters of ketchup bottles and dishes. In contrast to the miniatures, super-size puppets and masks created by Ralph Lee will also be on display.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Edward Cross has created small sets peopled by strange creatures made of found objects from his Lower East Side neighborhood. African-influenced masks and body puppets carved from a variety of flexible rubber pieces created by Garland Farwell will also surround the scene. These masks and body puppets, shown at left, were created in collaboration with Julio Leitao of the Harlem dance company Batoto Yetu.</p>

        <p>PROSPECT HEIGHTS  Forgotten Objects, Rediscovered</p>
        <p>The damage wasn't a result of last week's rainstorms: the little house pictured at right is a construction by a Brooklyn artist, Robert Kalka. Titled ''Forget Everything,'' it is a diorama of a house under construction enclosed in plexiglass, left to decay and saturated with water vapor to stimulate the destruction. Models of trees grow up through the unfinished frame. The construction is on view at the Brooklyn Public Library through Aug. 28.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kalka, who will give an artist's talk on Saturday afternoon, has been fascinated since childhood with rediscovering lost or forgotten objects.</p>
        <p>''In museums,'' Mr. Kalka said, ''ordinary objects become more interesting exactly because of traces of time, such as mold, that give them a meaningful context. Libraries create the same sense of treasure.''</p>
        <p>''Forget Everything'' through Aug. 28, Monday through Thursday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; artist's talk Saturday 2 p.m.; Lobby Gallery at the Central Library, Grand Army Plaza, Brooklyn; free; (718) 230-2122.</p>
