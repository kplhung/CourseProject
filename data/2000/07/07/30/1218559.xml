        <p>Home Town, by Tracy Kidder. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $14.95.) Through personal profiles and historical and demographic digressions, the author takes the pulse of Northampton, Mass., a city of 30,000 highly diverse people. Most of the natives leave when they reach adulthood, and are replaced by newcomers. Kidder's ''smart and gently ironic writing is always good company,'' Ben Yagoda wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>Louse, by David Grand. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) This satirical tale of a monstrous tycoon modeled on the aging Howard Hughes and the loyal valet who tends to his boss's increasingly eccentric demands mirrors the plight of workers in an era of job insecurity and corporate brainwashing. The result is ''a delightfully eerie and angry first novel,'' David Sacks said here last year.</p>

        <p>Louse, by David Grand. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) This satirical tale of a monstrous tycoon modeled on the aging Howard Hughes and the loyal valet who tends to his boss's increasingly eccentric demands mirrors the plight of workers in an era of job insecurity and corporate brainwashing. The result is ''a delightfully eerie and angry first novel,'' David Sacks said here last year.</p>
        <p>The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones, by Stanley Booth. (A Cappella, $16.95.) This backstage account of the band's 1969 tour and the author's own seduction by the group's dark allure is also a personal vision of how the 1960's, from Vietnam to Altamont, shaped an era. ''It is the only book about the Stones that I would recommend both to the general reader and to the most devoted fan,'' Robert Palmer said in these pages in 1984. ''Both will find an epiphany on almost every page.'' In Faithfull: An Autobiography, by Marianne Faithfull with David Dalton (Cooper Square, $16.95), the singer, 60's survivor and serial Rolling Stone paramour recounts her many love affairs with men, women and controlled substances. Her narrative is filled with ''spicy stories about Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Bob Dylan,'' David Kelly wrote here in 1994.</p>
        <p>Hummingbird House, by Patricia Henley. (MacMurray &amp; Beck, $13.) This first novel is about a burned-out American midwife working in Central America who seems to find her true cause in fighting the Guatemalan government's persecution of the country's indigenous Mayan people. ''Henley does a fine job of demonstrating the cost of compassion,'' Jeannie Pyun said here last year.</p>
        <p>The Sopranos, by Alan Warner. (Harvest/Harcourt, $14.) This tender novel follows a pack of choirgirls from rural Scotland as they embark on an odyssey of carousing while in the big city for a singing contest. ''It's refreshing to read a novel loaded down with teenage drinking, smoking, swearing and the urge for sex . . . and be spared the moralizing that usually goes along with these activities,'' Charles Taylor wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>Tales of Fishing Virgin Seas, by Zane Grey. (Derrydale, $19.95.) The acclaimed writer of westerns was also an insatiable angler and a passionate naturalist, as this illustrated account of his sailing trips throughout the Pacific reveals. ''Anyone who loves tales of adventure into far seas, unusual experiences, accounts of exotic and almost intoxicating beauty, to say nothing of those enthusiastic fishermen for whose perusal the book is especially intended, will find it a fascinating volume,'' the Book Review wrote in 1926.</p>
        <p>Mollie Peer: Or, The Underground Adventure of the Moosepath League, by Van Reid. (Penguin, $12.95.) This sequel to ''Cordelia Underwood: Or, The Marvelous Beginnings of the Moosepath League'' describes the continuing exploits of a Dickensian collection of journalists, journeymen, smugglers, baseball players, barkeeps, crooks and street urchins at loose in late 19th-century Maine. The result is ''a thoroughly easygoing and entertaining'' novel, Betsy Groban wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>Addie: A Memoir, by Mary Lee Settle. (Berkley, $13.) By casting her autobiography as a memoir about her grandmother, whose out-of-wedlock pregnancy scandalized turn-of-the-century West Virginia, the novelist explores the way one understands truth by indirection. ''Settle has preserved for us a moment in the South's history palpable as the trumpet vines and rocking chairs of a long-departed front-porch afternoon,'' Angeline Goreau wrote here in 1998.</p>
        <p>In the Drink, by Kate Christensen. (Anchor, $12.) Claudia Steiner could be Bridget Jones's darker twin: struggling to pay the rent on her studio apartment by toiling as a ghostwriter to an insane Park Avenue socialite, she can't keep from crawling through some of the city's meaner streets. Last year our reviewer, Vanessa Grigoriadis, called this a ''breezy and confident first novel.''</p>
        <p>A Short History of Rudeness: Manners, Morals, and Misbehavior in Modern America, by Mark Caldwell. (Picador USA, $13.) A literary critic surveys social behavior, past and present, and finds that while manners change over time, they are basically no worse today than they used to be. Last year our reviewer, Naomi Bliven, called this a ''modest, readable, intelligent and companionable'' book.</p>
