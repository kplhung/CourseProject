        <p>THE gun goes off and six 5-year-olds scramble down the track at Hendrick Hudson High School, changing lanes and bumping into one another. As they pass the finish line to the applause of parents, the runners beam and are each given a ribbon.</p>
        <p>It is a warm Tuesday evening at the school here in Montrose. And as they have for 19 years, children and their parents have come out to compete in the Westchester Summer Twilight Track and Field Series. The 14 events include the shot put, the discus throw and the high jump, among others.</p>
        <p>''It's a whole lot less to do about winning than it is to push yourself,'' said Roy Arnesen, 43, who helped create the meets and still oversees them. ''It's a positive thing in and of itself, to introduce the children to it, to have them be successful at it, to have kids take it up.''</p>
        <p>The lean Mr. Arnesen, an avid runner who teaches gym to special education students, has three children, all of whom run. But he has been careful not to put pressure on them.</p>
        <p>''To challenge yourself,'' he said, ''that's the whole stress.''</p>
        <p>Doug and Karen Miller, of Croton, who brought their son and daughter, agreed. ''My daughter said, 'I want to win once' because there was another girl running who was faster,'' she said looking at Victoria, who will turn 9 next month and has been running since she was 4. ''I said, 'You beat your time and that that was the important thing.' ''</p>
        <p>The meets are held every Tuesday from the middle of July to the middle of August and grew out of a series in White Plains, which Mr. Arnesen used to attend as the coach of a track club.</p>
        <p>The series lost its financing in 1981, so the next year he began holding three meets a summer in Ossining and then Somers. The meets began rotating sites (the rest of this summer's will be at Depew Park in Peekskill) and started to grow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arnesen, with the help of four volunteers, organizes and runs all the events at each meet. Close to 200 people were at the first meet of the season, and the crowd usually grows through the summer, Mr. Arnesen said.</p>
        <p>''It's a comfortable size right now,'' he said, adding that as the meets grow more funds will be needed. Currently, the Ossining Police Athletic League gives $250 and the towns of Peekskill and Cortlandt provide the facilities and insurance.</p>
        <p>In addition, all contestants must pay a $3 entry fee for the first event, and for $1 more, they can enter as many events as they want.  That money pays for the ribbons, given to each child competitor and the top three finishers in adult events. Trophies are also given to the three teams with the highest point totals for the season.</p>
        <p>On this particular Tuesday, many participants were trying new events. Stan and Celeste Hill, of Peekskill, looked on as their son Brandon, 9, did a long jump for the first time. ''He's doing all the events,'' Mr. Hill said, proudly announcing that his son had won the 55-meter sprint. Seconds after his jump, Brandon was racing down the track to shouts from the crowd.</p>
        <p>Michael Napoleone, who was competing in the long jump, said he got into running because of his father, George, who stood next to him watching a race. ''He used to go to the track near us,'' Michael said. ''I used to go with him and maybe run half a lap.'' Since then Michael has joined a track club and is getting into distance running. ''I pretty much enjoy the competition to see what I get, to see if I improve,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At 6:30 p.m., after the children have had their fun, anyone 15 or older can take the field, including many parents, giving the children a chance to cheer for a family member.</p>
        <p>''In the past, a lot of parents would come with the kids and some would be former runners,'' said Mr. Arnesen, explaining that very often the word ''former'' meant a hiatus of 15 years. ''They see the adult runners and say, 'Hey, I can beat those guys.' ''</p>
