        <p>IN a basement room of the Municipal Archives, at 31 Chambers Street, stands an enormous gleaming freezer, the kind of industrial-size appliance you might expect to find in the kitchen of a bustling restaurant. But ominous signs warn hungry snoops away. ''Toxic Material,'' they read. ''Alarm Will Sound!''</p>
        <p>What could this freezer contain? Dangerous chemical compounds? A vile new flavor of ice cream?</p>
        <p>The answer is film, roll upon roll of highly degradable and, yes, highly toxic 35-millimeter nitrate film stock. The negatives, stored at zero degrees to prevent them from corroding into poisonous dust, retain thousands of images of New York City from 1939 to 1941.</p>
        <p>During those years, a few dozen photographers fanned out to every corner of every borough to shoot virtually every building then standing. They did it as part of an ambitious tax assessment project overseen by the Department of Taxes (now the Department of Finance) and financed by the Works Progress Administration. Sixty years later, the pictures they took, more than 720,000, offer a moment of the city's history frozen in time.</p>
        <p>''It's extraordinarily comprehensive,'' said Kenneth Cobb, director of the archives. ''They photographed everything. Any building that was standing in 1940, we've got it. It's unbelievable, really.''</p>
        <p>The tax photographs, as they are commonly called, are mostly no-frills frontal shots of buildings and houses, each identified by block, lot number and borough. Next to the well-known street scenes photographed by Berenice Abbott, who also worked for the federal government in the late 30's, these pictures are likely to appear uninspired, even crude. Then again, Berenice Abbott didn't photograph every single building in New York City.</p>
        <p>''If you live in the Dakota, there are hundreds of historical pictures of your building,'' Mr. Cobb said. ''But if you live in an ordinary building on a side street, this is pretty much it.''</p>
        <p>The archives have made the photographs available to the public on microfilm since 1992. Prints can purchased for $25 each. (The archives can be reached at 212-788-8580.)</p>
        <p>''It's a way of filling in the gaps in the stories that your family tells,'' said Stanley Shor, chief of staff at the Department of Buildings and a frequent visitor to the archives. ''In the 30's and 40's, people didn't really take pictures of buildings. Film was too expensive to waste. So sometimes you'll get a bit of a house in the background, but never the full house.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shor has purchased photographs of the houses where his parents were born in Brooklyn and given others as gifts to relatives and friends. Recently, he found a photograph of his uncle's corner candy store in East New York. Sitting on steps at the side of the store is a girl with her elbows on her knees and her chin in her hands. That girl, Mr. Shor believes, is his mother.</p>
        <p>Beyond their significance as personal mementos, the tax photos are an important architectural record of the city for historians and preservationists.</p>
        <p>''The tax photos are always the first place you go to do your homework,'' said Christopher Neville of the historic preservation consulting firm of Higgins &amp; Quasebarth. ''You might be looking for precedents, for the types of things that were there -- kinds of signage, kinds of advertising, types of materials that were used, the location of an opening -- anything that might have changed over time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Neville, who estimated that he has viewed 1,000 tax photos, admits to a fascination with them beyond anything professional.</p>
        <p>''The effect of the photos is cumulative,'' he said. ''Things start to catch your eye, the ephemera of what you'll see on a theater marquee, or what you'll see in a passing car, or just something on the street. It's an accumulation of digressions, and you get the big picture from that.''</p>
        <p>The big picture is a portrait of New York in a slim moment of tranquillity between the last days of the Depression and America's entry into World War II. It is a city where  men wear hats and many women wear gloves. It is a city of horse-drawn milk carts and wooden pushcarts and sleek black automobiles and, from all appearances, plenty of parking space.</p>
        <p>Signs advertise overcoats for $3 and haircuts for 10 cents. A movie marquee in the Bronx entices audiences to ''The Lady in Question'' in a theater ''Now Scientifically Air-Cooled.'' On a side street in Manhattan, boys play stickball, while on a nearby block, a woman sits on a sill and washes a window high above the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>Behind the photographs is the mystery of the men -- apparently they were all men -- who took them. Little is known about the photographers. One contemporary magazine article (in The American City) suggests that they numbered 32 and were employed as part of a staff of 400, including film processors. They worked in two-man crews with assistants. Occasionally, the assistants appear in the photographs, hunching down or covering their eyes with hat brims, as if they'd been instructed to remain invisible.</p>
        <p>There is one photograph that seems to show the photographers themselves. A colleague of Mr. Cobb's found it at the start of a roll of film a few months ago. Eleven men pose for the camera, a few pieces of camera equipment scattered among them. What were their names? Were they professional photographers or amateurs who had lucked into a decent job? What became of them afterward?</p>
        <p>''I'd love to know more about them,''  Kenneth Cobb said. ''But I don't.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Neville says he sometimes senses their presence when he walks around the city.</p>
        <p>''They were there in front of your building 60 years ago,'' he said. ''They were there in front of my building. And it's all there down on Chambers Street.''</p>
