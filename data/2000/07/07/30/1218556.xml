        <p>EVER AFTER</p>
        <p>Diana and the Life She Led.</p>
        <p>By Anne Edwards.</p>
        <p>St. Martin's, $24.95.</p>
        <p>Surely the last book we need is yet another cliche-filled biography of the fairy-tale Princess Diana and the familiar details of her death. But Anne Edwards has provided just that, and the surprise is that it is actually interesting. At an early age, Diana was made aware of her Spencer heritage, dating back to Henry VII -- a higher order, her forebears believed, than the Windsors. (Among her antecedents were the Suffolk and Marlborough families and no fewer than seven American presidents.) The Spencers, according to Edwards, had been trying unsuccessfully for more than two centuries to wed their daughters to a Prince of Wales. Diana, awkward and shy, unable to come to grips with her height (at the age of 12, she was over 5 feet 10) and to keep up academically, seemed an unlikely candidate. Prince Charles, 13 years her senior, was being pressured to marry, but his romance with Camilla Parker Bowles was actively discouraged by the royal family. Charles's refusal to break with his mistress or end their intimate phone calls even during his courtship and marriage to the 20-year-old Diana exacerbated her insecurity, their destructive quarrels and her eating disorder. Once she was pregnant, nausea combined with bulimia to disgust an unsympathetic Charles and his mother. The early years of their marriage found Diana depressed and often alone, convinced that Charles was unfaithful. Edwards, whose previous biographical subjects include Katharine Hepburn, Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret, claims that as her private relationship with Charles grew more hostile, Diana's public demeanor became more confident, more glamorous and sophisticated. Edwards believes that Diana was part of a new generation whose feminism and outspokenness were shockingly unacceptable to Charles. Moreover, she observes, no other woman in our time has been subject to the pressures of such constant media attention -- with the possible exception of Monica Lewinsky.</p>
