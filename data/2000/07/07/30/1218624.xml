        <p>Bicyclists heading to Britain this summer have more than 5,000 miles of cycling paths to explore on the National Cycle Network. These signposted routes combine traffic-free sections of unused railway lines, canal towpaths and country lanes.</p>
        <p>The network is a project begun in 1995 by Sustrans, a nonprofit organization. The longest section, 501 miles from John O'Groats, the northernmost town in Scotland, to Aberdeen, opened in April. It includes ferry rides to the Orkney and Shetland Islands, and passes whiskey distilleries; Cawdor Castle, with its Shakespearean connections; coastal scenery like the Moray Firth and its wild dolphins, and Culloden Moor, where Bonnie Prince Charlie's army was defeated in 1745.</p>

        <p>In June, the 220-mile Celtic Trail opened, running east to west across South and West Wales from the Old Severn Bridge in Chepstow to the Pembokeshire Coast National Park. A branch of this route is surprisingly flat and passes such sites as the new National Botanic Gardens of Wales in Llanarthne, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Center at Penclacwydd, the Welsh capital, Cardiff, and the seaside town Tenby.</p>
        <p>Maps with local information cost $9, at 1.5 pounds to the dollar, and can be ordered from Sustrans, (44-117) 929-0888, or from the Web site www.sustrans.org.uk. ''The Official Guide to the National Cycle Network'' costs $15.</p>
