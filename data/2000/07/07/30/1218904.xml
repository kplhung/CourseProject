        <p>The Republican convention opening here on Monday is really two conventions, one for the delegates in the hall and another for the party's biggest contributors, who will be treated to a panoply of perks, from yacht rides to skyboxes high above the convention floor.</p>
        <p>With a record $137.4 million in large contributions already collected, the Republican Party is flush with soft money, the unrestricted party checks. But one of the central purposes of the gathering is to motivate the party's most generous supporters to raise and give still more.</p>
        <p>The Republican Party is poised to collect tens of millions of dollars more in soft money from corporate interests after the convention. A core group of business donors -- oil, tobacco, guns, real estate and software -- now form the financial backbone of the modern Republican Party. r</p>
        <p>The ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney is generating even greater enthusiasm in the business world and corporate donors have helped put the Republican Party in the best financial shape it has ever enjoyed going into a general election.</p>
        <p>To capitalize on the popularity of Mr. Bush, the second-term Texas governor, the party has created a new level of top givers -- the Regents, individuals and companies who have given the party at least $250,000 since January 1999. As of July 1, the Republican Party had more than 100 such donors, who will be rewarded at the convention with skybox seats, private dinners with party leaders, Champagne receptions and deluxe hotel accommodations (most of the Regents are staying at the Four Seasons). A few will be going on a fishing trip with Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois.</p>
        <p>In the past, political conventions have revolved around the drama of delegates selecting a presidential and vice-presidential nominee or fights over platform issues. With these issues largely decided before the convention, entertaining donors and pushing them to contribute more for the general election have become central parts of the proceedings.</p>
        <p>During the four-day convention, television cameras will focus on the stage where Mr. Bush will accept his party's presidential nomination and other party figures will speak. But much of the convention's real business will take place off-camera in hotel suites, hospitality tents, restaurants and country clubs where donors will be rewarded for past generosity and asked to give again.</p>
        <p>For the party's top underwriters, there will be an array of gold-plated events in Philadelphia, including  cocktails with Gen. Colin L. Powell and an evening cruise on the Delaware River aboard the ''Enterprise,'' the yacht owned by Richard M. DeVos, the Amway founder, who is a Bush supporter.</p>
        <p>The evolution of two distinctly different conventions, one a televised coronation of the Republican ticket, the other a behind-the-scenes parade of big donor events, is a striking development, said historian Richard F. Fenno Jr. of the University of Rochester. ''I'm not sure those two conventions even meet,'' Mr. Fenno said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has excited the corporate world more than any recent Republican presidential nominee,  party leaders say. His running mate, Mr. Cheney, the former defense secretary who until his selection was the chairman and chief executive officer of the Halliburton Company, the world's largest oil field services company, also generates enthusiasm in corporate boardrooms.</p>
        <p>''It excites the business community when they see people on the ticket who know what it takes to meet a payroll, fill out regulatory forms and pay taxes,'' said Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>Already, Mr. Bush's campaign has collected a record $90 million in federally restricted, individual donations of $1,000 or less; nearly one-quarter of that amount was raised by a national network of 212 business executives and wealthy individuals who call themselves the Pioneers.</p>
        <p>Interviews with many of the top 25 soft money donors to the Republican National Committee reveal that they are united by their opposition to what they describe as intrusive government regulation, their desire for much lower taxes and their loathing of lawmaking by litigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's proposal for a deep tax cut and his record of passing legislation to limit civil lawsuits in Texas are extremely appealing to the Republican Party's major underwriters. Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore's environmental views, among other issues, make some donors in the business community nervous.</p>
        <p>According to David B. Magleby, director of the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young University, many of those who write six-figure checks to a political party do so for calculated business reasons. ''This is money coming from interested companies and interested individuals who have agendas,'' Mr. Magleby said.</p>
        <p>The stakes for these donors are large: government appointments, from the Supreme Court to the Environmental Protection Agency; antitrust enforcement; tax policy; land use decisions; oil drilling permits; regulatory decisions.</p>
        <p>''Given the stakes they have, the investment they have made in this convention in Philadelphia is very modest, given the potential rate of return,'' Mr. Magleby added.</p>
        <p>The Democrats, of course, will be giving royal treatment to their largest donors at their convention in Los Angeles, too, with labor unions, trial lawyers and Hollywood executives among the biggest underwriters of the Democratic ticket. But the Democratic Party is struggling to compete with Mr. Bush and the Republican Party in America's corporate suites.</p>
        <p>Bill Pascoe, the Republican Party press secretary, emphasized that the party gets the bulk of its financial support from 570,000 small donors, including 140,000 people who contributed to the party for the first time this year.</p>
        <p>''Our fund-raising success is a measure of the broad and deep support that our party, its principles and our nominee -- Gov. George W. Bush -- have across this great land,'' Mr. Pascoe said.</p>
        <p>Three of the Republican National Committee's 10 largest donors, Philip Morris, the National Rifle Association and Microsoft, have contributed record sums to the Republican Party this year at a time when they face legal and legislative assaults led by the Democrats.</p>
        <p>The Enron Corporation, the Republican National Committee's second-largest donor, strongly favors  the party's economic policies, particularly its preference for free trade and a hands-off approach to the regulation of business, including enterprises as different as derivatives trading and Internet commerce.</p>
        <p>The companies and the individuals who make up the list of top contributors to the Republican National Committee say they are delighted by Mr.  Bush's rhetoric and his record.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important, Mr. Bush supports limits on damages in product liability lawsuits and on fees for trial lawyers and opposes federal anti-tobacco litigation. In Texas, he was also responsible for a $1.7 billion property tax break and environmental waivers for the oil and energy industries and has opposed most gun control legislation and government lawsuits against gun manufacturers.</p>
        <p>''I am not sympathetic to lawsuits,'' Mr. Bush said at a campaign stop in Washington State in February. ''Write that down. I worry about lawsuits on job creation. If you are looking for the kind of president I will be, I will be slow to litigate.''</p>
        <p>This is music to the ears of most business executives.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Philip Morris, the Republican committee's largest single donor at $619,000 as of June 30, said that the company supports Republicans because they are ''people who share similar views on issues that are important,'' including the regulation of tobacco. Another industry official said he expected that Mr. Bush would treat cigarette companies fairly, while President Clinton has used the industry as a whipping boy.</p>
        <p>Few companies have as much at stake in November's election as Enron, the giant Houston energy and trading concern that, over the years, has been Governor Bush's largest corporate sponsor as well as a generous soft-money donor to the Republican Party. Enron and its chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay,  have been the top patrons of Mr. Bush's political career since his first campaign for Congress in 1978. Since January 1999, Enron and its executives have donated $615,550 to the Republican National Committee, the second-highest amount of any individual or corporation in that period.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's tenure in Texas has been beneficial to Enron: he backed several of the company's most important legislative initiatives, including electric utility deregulation and  limits on civil lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Enron is even more explicit about why it wants to see Mr. Bush and other Republicans elected in November. A June 15 internal memorandum to executives soliciting contributions to the company's political action committee lays out the reasons: Enron faces numerous legal and regulatory challenges, the memorandum says, including taxation of electronic commerce, restructuring of the electric industry, international trade legislation, regulation of power plants and oil pipelines and a variety of environmental and tax issues.</p>
        <p>The memorandum, which cites a $1 million fund-raising goal, details suggested ''voluntary'' contributions for Enron executives, from $500 a year for a low-level manager to $5,000 a year for a member of the executive committee.</p>
        <p>A Democratic Enron employee who received the letter said some employees found the solicitation objectionable. The employee also said that some employees have begun to complain that too many corporate resources are being spent to support Mr. Bush's campaign.</p>
        <p>''The wholehearted endorsement of Governor Bush, and the brazen use of the corporate machinery to ensure his election, seems distasteful,'' said the employee, who insisted on anonymity.</p>
        <p>Mark A. Palmer, a vice president at Enron, said the political action committee is intended to improve Enron's name recognition. ''We are one of the few companies in this industry that has advocated 100 percent for open markets and for taking away the monopoly protection that this industry has enjoyed for so long,'' Mr. Palmer said.</p>
        <p>The National Rifle Association is the fifth-largest donor to the Republican committee, with contributions totaling $508,000 since the beginning of 1999. The group has given other Republican committees an additional $250,000, while donating nothing to the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush opposed state and federal lawsuits against gun makers  and supported the N.R.A.'s version of a bill to require background checks at gun shows. In the House, Mr. Cheney was a staunch ally of gun owners.</p>
        <p>Sam Wyly and his brother, Charles J. Wyly Jr., longtime friends of Mr.  Bush, are among the most generous individual underwriters of the Republican Party. They have supported Mr. Bush not only with $500,000 in donations to the party but also with a $2.5 million television advertising campaign against his rival in the Republican primaries Senator John McCain of Arizona last winter.</p>
        <p>Sam Wyly's businesses have fared well during Mr. Bush's tenure as Texas governor. Two years ago, one of the Wyly firms, Maverick Capital, won a state contract to manage $96 million of the University of Texas endowment fund.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wyly said that he supported Republican economic policies, but that he hoped to make the party more broad-minded on social policy.</p>
        <p>''I've got a long history working for minorities,'' Mr. Wyly said, ''and I think our efforts make it easier for people of similar persuasions to feel more comfortable with the Republican Party.''</p>
        <p>Sam Fox, the chairman and chief executive officer of Harbour Group, a manufacturing company in Missouri, is the individual who has contributed the most to the Republican National Committee -- $575,000. But in an interview this week, he insisted that he gives a lot to the party because it shares his goal of ''good government and no debts.''</p>
        <p>''When we part with $250,000 of after-tax money that is not deductible, we have to believe in the cause,'' Mr. Fox said, adding that he is motivated by a desire ''to see honor and dignity restored to the White House.''</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE MONEY  Correction:  August 26, 2000, Saturday  A chart on July 30 based on data from the Campaign Study Group, a nonpartisan research organization, about the 10 largest donors to the Republican National Committee, with an article about large, unregulated donations to the Republican Party, included one company erroneously. Sam Wyly, who founded Maverick Capital, and his brother Charles J. Wyly Jr. together donated $505,000 to the Republicans in this campaign, but they no longer have any relation to Maverick Capital; people connected with the company were not among the party's 10 biggest donors.</p>
        <p>The chart also described the company incorrectly. It is a money management firm, not a venture capital firm in the energy business.</p>
