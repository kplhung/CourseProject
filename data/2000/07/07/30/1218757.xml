        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am delighted to hear the Princeton Rep Company (''A Wandering Troupe at Home in Princeton,'' July 16) is thriving. When Victoria Liberatori and I founded the Princeton Rep Company we did indeed have a home. The Princeton Arts Council welcomed and sustained us for five years. In fact we were the resident theater company at the council and participated in many town and gown projects. Our New Year's ''Cabaret'' was the precursor to Curtain Calls, the New Year's Eve event that draws thousands to Princeton. Without acknowledging those who helped us thrive -- the patrons, arts and especially the arts council -- makes the Rep Company story more like the ''fairey'' tale that the company recently told in Pettronello Park.</p>
