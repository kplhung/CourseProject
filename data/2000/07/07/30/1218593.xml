        <p>One of the first things that struck me when I started as president of The New York Times Foundation this year is the language of philanthropy. It was probably inevitable. Years as a writer and editor at The Times had sharpened my eye for jargon, much of it from government and politics. It took only a few weeks of reading grant applications from educational, cultural, social, environmental and even journalistic groups to realize that the foundation world is equally burdened with limp, lazy usages. But there is a difference. In grant applications, trite, trendy or vague terms do more than glaze the reader's eye. They invite grant denials.</p>
        <p>Here is our Word of the Month, from an application for a learning center: empowermation. Here is our Phrase of the Month, from an educational reform organization: ''convening stakeholders to develop action plans to promote standards reform, and initiating implementation of those plans.'' And here is a collection of trendy terms, drawn from our experience and that of others on both sides of the grant-making business:</p>
        <p>Many of these terms are objects of comment in a booklet just published by the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, ''In Other Words'' (available while copies last from the foundation, 250 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10177). Michael Bailin, its president, having heard just about all the ways people ask for money, sometimes finds himself recoiling from such terms of beseechment. So he decided to do something about it, in just the way you'd imagine a foundation executive would. He commissioned Tony Proscio, a foundation consultant and former editorial writer, to write a report.</p>
        <p>''In Other Words'' is the result, and in it Proscio performs skillful verbal archeology. For instance, he traces the term throughput back to industrial engineering before World War II. ''After some years of disciplined life describing the pace and scope of work on old-fashioned assembly lines,'' he says, the word became popular in the infant computer industry. ''But the computer pioneers soon lost control of the word. . . . Throughput is now the universal metaphor for any interval between the moment anything is put into anything else and the moment it re-emerges, presumably altered.''</p>
        <p>It is the same process of dilution, Proscio notes, that has afflicted its parent words, input and output (as in ''the family pet recently output on the living-room carpet''). En route to being emptied of meaning altogether, terms like these become buzzwords, Proscio says, and ''a policy paper simply isn't serious if it doesn't include the latest exotic technical term or chic business school phrase.''</p>
        <p>Excuses can be made for some jargon, some of the time. One is the need for shorthand. Experts in community-development corporations are surely entitled to say ''C.D.C.'' to one another. Likewise, it is understandable when</p>
        <p>people asking for money curry favor by parroting back language they think foundations like. Bailin recently instituted a funding category called ''institution and field building.'' Soon, he says, he got back inquiries dutifully using the term ''even though I myself wasn't entirely sure what I meant by it.''</p>
        <p>Excuses aside, by using lame or impenetrable terms, organizations that serve laudable public purposes do not advance their chances in the competition for foundation funds -- not when most jargon and cliches can be avoided with a little effort. Here is a round of applause to the Chubb Insurance Company for telling customers: ''In this policy, we use words in their plain English meaning. Words with special meanings are defined in the part of the policy where they are used.''</p>
        <p>The offending terms cited here are hardly limited to philanthropy. They befog language in the academy, the Pentagon, the laboratory, the corporate office. Glazing the eye, they dissolve into invisibility, discourage reading and defeat comprehension completely.</p>
        <p>Spinicism</p>
        <p>Bill Safire, the regular proprietor of this space, once generously identified me as the coiner of the term ''spin doctors,'' referring to faceless campaign aides who work ceaselessly to impart favorable interpretations to their candidates' harried pronouncements. Let me offer another neologism to describe a related attitude that has been evolving over the last decade and more.</p>
        <p>Why, as demonstrated by dismal voter turnout, has the public become so indifferent to government, politics and public life? The most likely answers include private preoccupation with affluence and the excrescent excesses of campaign finance. There's another, equally plausible possibility: a huge overdose of spin.</p>
        <p>The effects of spin, like radiation, are probably cumulative over a lifetime, and in recent years, people have been subjected to an ever-rising tide of it. Think of all the speeches written by ghosts, the talk show appearances rehearsed with consultants, the TV ads edited down to the last microsecond by creative directors and imagery and icons devised by professional design teams. What reality remains?</p>
        <p>At some point, one is tempted to think, people will instinctively recognize how little these media manipulations resemble the real candidates. And at that point -- a point that may have already arrived -- people will have learned to discount all the spin and to react with skepticism, even cynicism. Hence spinicism. And hence the public's appetite for recent television inventions like ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother.'' The settings may be contrived, but paradoxically in our rehearsed world, the participants' behavior is reassuringly real.</p>
