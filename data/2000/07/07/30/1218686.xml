        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a child who grew up on the rock 'n' roll of the 50's and 60's, I had little patience for jazz. Jazz, unlike rock 'n' roll, required you to pay attention. As an adult, it was Pat Metheny's music that first drew me to jazz -- it wasn't classic jazz, it was a blend of rock and jazz. It ultimately led me to purer forms of jazz as my musical tastes evolved. I am still a fan of Pat Metheny, because I think he, too, has moved beyond his early music. But I found it odd that he criticized Kenny G and, essentially, the whole smooth jazz genre. I think this music plays an important role by exposing many of us to a form of jazz that is simply easy to listen to. It opens doors and allows us to make that transition to classic jazz if we choose to. Not unlike what Pat Metheny's music did for this listener.</p>
