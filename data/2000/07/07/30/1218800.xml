        <p>IT was opening night at the Half King on West 23rd Street, and though the bar was still half finished, fragrant with damp paint and sawdust, it was at full capacity with a crowd of authors, magazine journalists, literary agents and editors. Sebastian Junger, the best-selling author of ''The Perfect Storm,'' and one of the Half King's owners, was behind the bar in a black blazer and open-necked shirt, unshaven, cupping a Camel Light to his mouth.  Scott Anderson, his fellow journalist-turned-barkeeper, worked the beer taps, topping off some foamy pints.</p>
        <p>The Half King was dreamed up as a saloon for writers, which is notable at a time when New York is awash with velvet-roped night spots but watering holes for literary life have virtually dried up. It's a romantic vision, a smoke-filled room where writers can drown their sorrows after deadline. And on opening night, it all looked as perfect as a movie set, down to the Hollywood producer's stretch limousine left idling outside.</p>
        <p>''It's been a long time since we've seen writers open up a bar in New York,'' said Chris Calhoun, an agent with Sterling Lord Literistic, squeezing in at the mahogany bar-rail for a vodka. ''The last one I can remember was Sidney Zion with Broadway Joe.''</p>
        <p>That was decades ago, of course, when newspapermen still wore fedoras and had ink-stained fingertips. And though the Half King has been billed as a throwback to the old-school haunt, where a scribbler flashed a press pass and was given a tab, the idea of a writer's bar is a bit more glamorous than in the heyday of the Lion's Head. In the old days, a journalist's hangout was a scruffy, workingman's joint where an errant glance or a bumped shoulder might quickly lead to a fisticuffs. These days, you're likely to be rubbing shoulders with a cell phone-toting DreamWorks executive looking to snap up your life rights.</p>
        <p>''Scott and I are journalists, true, but our other two partners are in film,'' Mr. Junger said, referring to Nanette Burstein, the director of the Academy Award-nominated documentary ''On the Ropes,'' and Jerome O'Connor, the</p>
        <p>Irish-born producer of the forthcoming Barry Levinson comedy ''An Everlasting Piece.''</p>
        <p>Even before the Half King opened, the place had a movie business buzz, and not just because the film version of Mr. Junger's book, starring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg, was flexing its box office muscle across the country. Earlier this month, Mr. Junger, Mr. Anderson and another journalist friend, John Falk (who doubles as the Half King's bartender), parlayed one of their recent misadventures in Sarajevo into a pitch meeting and a high-six-figure movie option. The story goes that while on vacation in Bosnia -- who vacations in Bosnia? -- the three journalists found themselves mistaken for C.I.A. operatives, and an adventure caper ensued straight out of ''The Third Man.'' Now, they're collaborating on the script for Intermedia, with Mr. O'Connor set to produce. The film's other producer, Mark Johnson, whose credits include ''Rain Man'' and ''Donnie Brasco,'' flew in from Los Angeles expressly for the Half King premiere.</p>
        <p>In spite of all the glossy Hollywood connections, Mr. Junger, who struggled for years as an underpaid freelancer before hitting it big with ''The Perfect Storm,'' said that his bar was inspired by the grittier demands of his job. It was while he was working as a foreign correspondent recently with Mr. Anderson that they dreamt up the bar venture. ''When you're working abroad, there's always these bars that journalists end up hanging out in, particularly in war zones,'' Mr. Junger said. ''Of course, there's always some bad eggs, but that network of fellow writers is incredibly helpful, if not lifesaving. It comes down to very practical stuff like 'Does anyone know a good driver or translator?' -- the kind of things you inevitably end up dealing with in these hot spots. O.K., so this isn't a hot spot, it's New York, but we're still hoping the word gets around with visiting journalists and with local journalists, and they'll just keep checking in.''</p>
        <p>The following evening, Mr. Junger's new bar was decidedly not a hot spot. With the mob now vanished, the Half King -- named for an obscure Indian chief who, Mr. Anderson explained, had played the British and French against each other during the Revolutionary period -- looked like just another sleepy neighborhood pub starved for business on a dead Friday night. The four owners outnumbered the paying customers 2 to 1. ''Nobody really knows we're open yet,'' Mr. O'Connor muttered in his thick County Cork accent. ''And anybody that does know we're open is still hung over from last night.''</p>
        <p>He took a journalist on a tour of the bar's hardscrabble past, down to the unfinished basement, where, the story goes, the gangland boss Waxey Gordon once ran a gambling operation. ''Right there, on that spot, is where they played poker,'' Mr. O'Connor said, ducking his head under a whitewashed archway that seemed specifically designed to accommodate the frames of 5-foot-6-inch mobsters. ''Now, this room is going to be our movie production office.''</p>
        <p>Back upstairs, Mr. Junger and Mr. Anderson were at one of the antique oak tables, smoking and gazing out the window at the rusty elevated railroad tracks that lent the darkening Chelsea sky the look of film noir. ''We need to get the mix right between a journalist's hangout and a place that anyone can come,'' Mr. Junger mused. ''We don't want it to feel like a private little scene. We don't want to start sliding down into becoming some kind of literary . . . ''</p>
        <p>''Salon,'' Mr. Anderson said, completing his friend's thought with a frown.</p>
        <p>They want to wrest the writer's social scene away from effete intellectualism (say, an exclusive uptown soiree to honor Martin Amis), and give it back a more rugged, Hemingwayesque sex appeal. There's little doubt that the bar's main attraction -- from the feminine perspective, at least -- will be the prospect of a chance encounter with Mr. Junger, who has become nearly as famous for his square-jaw book jacket pose as for his disaster-at-sea prose. At the opening night party, several women turned doe-eyed whenever Mr. Junger passed their way with pints of beer.</p>
        <p>But if fans of Mr. Junger's writing head down to West 23rd Street expecting to see a recreation of the Crow's Nest, the bare-knuckled fishing bar depicted in ''The Perfect Storm,'' they'll be disappointed.  What they'll find is a slightly upscale version of a rustic neighborhood tavern, with apricot-colored walls, a cluster of black leather sofas and a peaceful, shaded back garden.</p>
        <p>Ms. Burstein, who is Mr. Anderson's girlfriend, said that all the partners had contributed to picking out the bar's decor -- she herself had found the antique window frames in a demolished Harlem warehouse -- and it amused her when advance reports kept describing the Half King as some kind of macho clubhouse and tough-guy haven.</p>
        <p>''That's just because they haven't seen us in our pink frilly dresses,'' Mr. Anderson said to Mr. Junger.</p>
