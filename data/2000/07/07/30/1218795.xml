        <p>WHAT do Americans want? More, always more, it seems, and automakers are happy to comply, cramming six pistons into cars that run nicely on four and shoehorning V-8's into engine bays where V-6's are a tight fit. And not often does a redesigned car or truck end up smaller than the one it replaces.</p>
        <p>Already large automobiles are not exempt from size creep. Mercedes-Benz once offered both long- and longer-wheelbase versions of its biggest sedan, but Americans showed a strong preference for the first-class cabin, rendering business-class accommodations unnecessary. BMW has the 740iL and 750iL, with rear seats that come closer to meeting the bottom-line needs of well-fed customers. Jaguar, whose charms have included famously cozy rear quarters, added the commodious XJ8 L and Vanden Plas. And a slightly stretched Lincoln now accounts for 8 percent of Town Car sales.</p>

        <p>WHAT do Americans want?

        <p>Already large automobiles are not exempt from size creep. Mercedes-Benz once offered both long- and longer-wheelbase versions of its biggest sedan, but Americans showed a strong preference for the first-class cabin, rendering business-class accommodations unnecessary. BMW has the 740iL and 750iL, with rear seats that come closer to meeting the bottom-line needs of well-fed customers. Jaguar, whose charms have included famously cozy rear quarters, added the commodious XJ8 L and Vanden Plas. And a slightly stretched Lincoln now accounts for 8 percent of Town Car sales.</p>
        <p>So who should be surprised that for 2000, Audi has the A8L, a five-inch-longer version of its all-aluminum luxury liner? Only those, perhaps, who recall that when the A8 made its debut, less than four years ago, Audi mocked competitors by summarizing its car's virtues as ''excellence without excess, class without mass.''</p>
        <p>There is still excellence in the A8's advanced space frame, a rigid skeleton of lightweight aluminum, and in its unobtrusive Quattro all-wheel drive. There is class, too, in the understated but sumptuous cabin, which has gained nearly 3 inches of rear legroom and a bit of extra space for heads and elbows.</p>
        <p>As for mass, the A8L is hardly lacking, since even with all those aluminum pieces it tips the scales at 4,156 pounds, a bit more than the steel-body Mercedes S500. The A8L measures 203.3 inches long, about the same as the Mercedes and a bit longer than the BMW 740iL.</p>
        <p>The pluses and minuses of this outsized Audi were evident on a 1,500-mile trip through Northern California and Nevada, given that the car was saddled with four adults, six sizable bags and a few bottles of cabernet sauvignon picked up during stops in wine country. The $72,525 test car (base price, $68,425) proved an excellent choice for luxurious grand touring, pampering passengers with a ride that was practically serene.</p>
        <p>Its climate control was put to the test, since we visited wine country during a heat wave. After a memorable hot lunch in a restaurant whose air conditioner had failed, the Audi's external thermometer registered 120 degrees. Given what it was up against, the climate system coped admirably.</p>
        <p>The backseat is the big news here, and it got rave reviews from its occupants. There were firm but cosseting seats covered in perforated leather, power-adjusted headrests and lumbar support and no lack of space. Two 70-something passengers could quibble only about the backrest (raked a little too steeply) and the sunscreens (ineffective against a blazing California sun). But they appreciated how the wider doors aided entrances and exits, particularly when noontime placed them at their fourth wine tasting of the day.</p>
        <p>From the driver's seat, though, the Audi reminds one about the march of progress. While the A8 seemed so innovative in 1996 -- it was called ''the first luxury car of the 21st century'' on this page -- it competes in a segment that changed radically a year ago with the arrival of an all-new S-Class. While the Audi has bulked up, the Mercedes trimmed down and learned to dance.</p>
        <p>In our travels, the A8L never faltered, whether tracing switchbacks in the Sierra Nevada or negotiating jagged ocean-view turns on Highway 1. And if it had, a new stability control could step in to save the day. Yet a touch of body roll on turns, and steering that didn't feel as crisp as it actually proved to be, made it clear that this was a luxury cruiser, not an overgrown sport sedan. Its luxurious size also made for tight maneuvers in cramped public garages. And on sharp descents, the five-speed Tiptronic transmission resolutely refused to engage first gear except for an instant after a standing stop, forcing overuse of the brake pedal.</p>
        <p>This is a brisk car for its size, capable of 0-to-60 dashes in well under 7 seconds, yet the test car felt leaden in a range of 1,200 to 1,800 r.p.m. The horsepower of the dual-cam 4.2-liter V-8 has been raised to 310. There are 302 foot-pounds of peak torque for Autobahn zoom at cruising speeds. Yet the A8L managed to feel a bit sluggish when merging into traffic at 45 m.p.h. or climbing a steep grade in high elevations.</p>
        <p>A long car trip turns little annoyances into oversized irritations. In the A8L, these included a touchy throttle that works against smooth starts; one-touch window switches that never performed as expected; and overcomplicated audio and climate controls. I did not use the standard-equipment navigation system, for lack of a map disk, and I eventually switched off the acoustic parking sensors (a $700 option), which detect obstacles as you try to dock this zeppelin. The system is calibrated so sensitively that it beeps long before you're close to another car's bumper, and it makes a terrible racket, too.</p>
        <p>At night, the cabin is a little Las Vegas of red lights, with more than 100 switches, knobs and buttons. Aside from being a bit overwhelming, the controls are not particularly intuitive, but they do put one in the mood to visit a casino. No wonder that when we pulled up to Harrah's on Lake Tahoe in our impressively oversized Audi, friendly people greeted us as if we were high rollers.</p>
