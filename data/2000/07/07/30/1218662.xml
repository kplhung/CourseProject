        <p>WHEN a coaching legend hands you the ball, what do you do?</p>
        <p>You run with it. And run some more.</p>
        <p>At least that appears to be the approach of Ron Lombardi as he prepares for his first season directing the storied Roosevelt High School football program, taking over from Tony DeMatteo.</p>
        <p>''We're going to be a running team,'' Lombardi said. ''Normally, my teams pass about 40 percent and run about 60 percent, but this year we've got one of the best backs in the county and we'll run more.''</p>
        <p>The back in question is Jerrel Jones, a 5-foot-7, 160-pound junior who is as quick as he is small.</p>
        <p>''He's very fast,'' Lombardi said. ''The fastest back I've ever had.''</p>
        <p>For Lombardi, 57, that spans a head-coaching career begun in 1980 and shows a 97-93-3 overall record. Lombardi, who lives in Hopewell Junction in Dutchess County, thought his career had ended after a 1998 season with Notre Dame Bishop Gibbons in Schenectady.</p>
        <p>''I retired for one year; I didn't like it,'' he said. ''I found I missed coaching football.''</p>
        <p>And suddenly the Roosevelt job opened up. DeMatteo, who had won a Section I-record 208 games over 31 seasons at Roosevelt, left to fulfill a father's dream, moving to smaller Somers High, where he will have the opportunity to coach two sons. Lombardi was on the short list of his recommendations for a successor.</p>
        <p>''I know Ron, and I know he'll do a good job,'' DeMatteo said.</p>
        <p>It will continue to be a good program, Lombardi said, in a school where football is a source of pride.</p>
        <p>''We're going to be a senior-laden team,'' he said, citing 6 returning starters and 21 returning seniors. ''I'm expecting pretty good things.''</p>
        <p>And they will start with the running game. Besides the elusive Jones, there is another smallish track star, the 5-foot-8, 160-pound Steven Hernandez running the ball. ''And when we get to the I-formation, George Yacaub will be the big back,'' Lombardi said of a hard-hitting, 5-foot-10, 195 pounder.</p>
        <p>Another lightweight, the 5-foot-8, 150-pound Joe Soto is the ''4-Back'' in Lombardi's terminology, meaning the flanker who is primarily a pass-catcher. The new coach has had only one short summer camp and a brief conditioning program and has seen only about half of his squad, but he has no doubt who will be catching the passes for Roosevelt. ''Soto is a great receiver,'' Lombardi said. ''He'll be the key to the passing game.''</p>
        <p>Defensively, Lombardi will use a 5-2 alignment to take advantage of three large tackles: Elijah Darby, first team all-section, all-county and all-conference, Robert Castro and Hegner Anderson. The defensive end Dino Argyris has impressed Lombardi with his dedication. Terrence Parks-Bailey is a big, quick guard, and Joel Altavilla is a quick and sure linebacker.</p>
        <p>Then there's quarterback.</p>
        <p>Among the graduating seniors this June were the top three quarterbacks.</p>
        <p>''I'm working with three quarterbacks,'' Lombardi said. ''Two will be seniors this year, Trevor Cooper and Derryl Fisher, while Tyrone Bergman will be a sophomore.</p>
        <p>''Tyrone has the best arm, and hopefully I'll be grooming him for next year. Trevor is the more forceful leader and a lot bigger than the others.''</p>
        <p>Cooper clearly has confidence as well as size. ''I was a tight end last year, but a quarterback earlier at Tuckahoe High School,'' he said, then shrugged. ''It's an easy transition back.''</p>
        <p>The transition to Lombardi from DeMatteo likewise seems relatively easy.</p>
        <p>Cooper said: ''Is there anything we have been doing different? Not really. Coach Lombardi has a quote: 'Believe and achieve.' That's basically what we'll be doing. Both coaches have the same intensity. They both believe in winning.'' Jones said: ''But there is a difference. Coach D would threaten you more. Coach L is more of a laid-back coach.''</p>
        <p>Darby said in agreement: ''He's not on us as much.''</p>
        <p>Soto added: ''But it is different without Coach DeMatteo. We have to learn a different defense and new terms and a new numbering system.''</p>
        <p>Time is something Roosevelt will not have much of when the squad gathers in earnest this fall. In DeMatteo's last season, Roosevelt was 7-3 and won a bowl game. Its three losses were to North Rockland, Gorton and Clarkstown South. Those are the first three teams on this season's schedule.</p>
        <p>''I've told the kids we're on a mission,'' Lombardi said.</p>
        <p>FOR THE RECORD</p>
