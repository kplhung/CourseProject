        <p>THE seemingly unending boom in the hotel business in New York continued unabated during the first half of this year, despite an influx of new rooms and the prospect of more to come.</p>
        <p>According to a survey by PKF Consulting, which specializes in the hospitality industry, the occupancy rate in Manhattan reached 84.4 percent, a record for any six-month period since the firm began collecting statistics in the 1920's.</p>
        <p>The average cost of spending a night reached $224.83 during the period, also a record, and an 8.0 percent increase compared with the same period last year. And the trend is upward. PKF reported that the average room rate for the month of June was $236.54, an 11.7 percent increase over June 1999.</p>
        <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm, which conducts a similar survey, reported the occupancy rate at 84 percent and the average room rate at  $249 a night.</p>
        <p>''Occupancy and room rates were at record levels, and this is supposed to be the slow half of the year,'' said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF, who explained that demand for hotel rooms is typically lower in the January-to-June months than in July to December, a period of vacations and holidays when people are more apt to travel to New York.</p>
        <p>''Hotels in the city are selling out 200 to 250 nights a year, which means they are turning away business, so I am not concerned that we are going to be adding some rooms,'' Mr. Fox added.</p>
        <p>He said the strong market of the last few years has encouraged the development of hotel projects, including the conversion of office buildings and the upgrading of single-room-occupancy hotels to those catering to transients.</p>
        <p>Some 4,000 to 4,500 hotel rooms are expected to be added to the New York market this year, one of the largest expansions in recent years.</p>
        <p>Tourist interest in New York accounts for much of the demand for lodging in the city, as the crowds surging through Times Square and along Fifth Avenue every day  attest.</p>
        <p>But the buoyant economy, which is gobbling up office space in the city, is increasing demand from business travelers as well.</p>
        <p>Bjorn Hanson, the global leader of the PricewaterhouseCoopers hospitality practice, has calculated that every additional 100 square feet of office space that is occupied in the city generates 0.7 room nights of hotel demand.</p>
        <p>Responding to this demand, developers are rushing to complete new hotels, most of them conversions of existing buildings. An exception to this trend is the Sofitel that  opened earlier month on 44th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas; it was new construction from the ground up. Rooms cost $350 a night, and  suites, $450.</p>
        <p>Another new entrant in the market is the Red Roof Inn Manhattan, the franchise chain's first in New York City, on 32nd Street just west of Fifth Avenue in a converted office building not far from Herald Square. The hotel was developed by Apple Core Hotels, a company owned by the Horn and Kohane families that has four other moderately priced hotels in Midtown Manhattan and a hotel and conference center in Hempstead, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The $23 million conversion of the 17-story loft building on 32nd Street has produced a hotel with 171 guest rooms plus a business center, exercise room, meeting space and a breakfast room.</p>
        <p>Room rates will range from $89 to $329 a night, which is in marked contrast to some of the other new boutique hotels scheduled to open soon, where room rates will start at nearly $300 a night.</p>
        <p>Vijay Dandapani, Apple Core's chief operating officer, said converting the old loft building to a hotel was difficult, particularly so because a retail store on the first floor refused to leave, limiting the size of the lobby. He said that passenger elevators are now where the freight elevators were in the old building, and the shafts for the old passenger elevators are occupied by a stairwell.</p>
        <p>''Just about everything is new, but the four walls on the outside,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Since the building is hemmed in on three sides on the lower floors, most of those floors were unsuitable for guest rooms, which have to have a window. So that is where the exercise, conference, business and breakfast rooms were situated. On the upper floors, windows have been punched through the walls, even though the view is often only of the roofs of lower buildings nearby.</p>
        <p>BUT there will be some sweeping views  from a glass-enclosed rooftop bar, which Mr. Dandapani hopes to complete within a year.</p>
        <p>A similar rooftop bar already exists at the Best Western Manhattan, which Apple Core also owns. It is on the north side of 32nd Street, just to the west of the Red Roof, and hotel guests there can take in the sight of the  Empire State Building looming in the background only a block away.</p>
        <p>Apple Core's other hotels, all developed in the last five years, are the Quality Hotel &amp; Suites at 59 West 46th Street; the Comfort Inn at 129 West 46th Street; and the Quality Hotel at 161 Lexington Avenue (30th Street).</p>
        <p>Although all the hotels are operated in collaboration with national chains, Mr. Dandapani said Apple Core has its own reservation system, which brings in about 50 percent of the reservations independent of the franchise affiliations. It is staffed 24 hours a day, he said, to avoid forcing front-desk clerks to make reservations in addition to their other duties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dandapani said the Apple Core's occupancy rate runs well over 90 percent and said that the group was looking for other properties to develop as hotels in New York. But, he added, they must be well located and suitable for conversion.</p>
        <p>One building that Apple Core bought but later decided was not suitable for its market is the old Leavitt Building at 130 West 46th Street. Acquired from Apple Core for the Mass Mutual Financial Group by Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers, the new hotel is scheduled to open next month as the Muse, with 200 rooms. It is being described as a boutique hotel that will emphasize personal service at rates that will range from $295 to $395 a night.</p>
        <p>The hotel's proximity to the theater district will be emphasized in a ground-floor restaurant -- so far unnamed -- that was designed by David Rockwell, who did such restaurants as Nobu and Heartbeat. The exterior will have a simulated curtain of woven stainless steel drawn up to one side as if opening onto a stage. Inside, the decorations will include simulated theater scenery with banks of spotlights.</p>
        <p>The restaurant will have 85 seats and will provide room service for the hotel and a complimentary buffet called the ''midnight pantry,'' where guests can find cookies and desserts, fruit and cheese plates and ice cream after a night at the theater.</p>
        <p>Another boutique hotel scheduled to open late this summer is the Dylan, in the former Chemists Club at 52 East 41st Street, between Madison and Park Avenues. The renovation of the 1903 building cost Morris Moinian, the developer, $30 million and produced a 108-room hotel, with rates of $295 to $450 a night.</p>
        <p>The hotel's restaurant will be called Rx, with a nod to the building's past. The hotel will have two conference rooms that can be combined to seat up to 75 people. Guest rooms will have high-speed access to the Internet and a television set with Web access.</p>
        <p>The Grand Central Partnership, the local business improvement district, is planting trees along the sidewalks in the area and installing antique-style street lamps with hanging flower baskets. Plans are to designate that section of 41st Street as Library Walk in recognition of its proximity to the New York Public Library and to install plaques in the sidewalk with quotes from famous books.</p>
