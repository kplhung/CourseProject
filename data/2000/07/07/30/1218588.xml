        <p>IN summer when the local population is augmented by the swarm of tourists that descend on Amsterdam, walking the web of streets and alleys that crisscross the canals can be exhausting. And at any time of year, this densely populated city can feel crowded.</p>
        <p>For those who want a bit of an escape, there is a serene counterpoint to the city's bustle just a half-hour out of town.</p>
        <p>Volendam is a fishing village on the coast of what was called the Zuider Zee until 1932,  when the Dutch government built a dike that closed it off from the sea. Visitors can get there either by car or by bus, which runs  every 30 minutes from Amsterdam's Central Station -- a 15-minute walk from the center of town.</p>
        <p>Volendam's harbor is ringed with two-  and three-story houses painted in cheerful tones of green, black and red, their windows immaculately trimmed in white. Larger European harbors are often crowded with speed boats, but there was only one docked in Volendam the day my son, David, and I  visited last summer. Instead, small modern sailboats or old wood-bottomed fishing boats rested at the slips. Their owners still earn their living catching herring, eel and shrimp. The day we sat drinking koffie verkeerd -- the Dutch version of cafe au lait -- ''The Mermaid,'' a double-masted old wood clipper, sailed into port, manned by local fishermen.</p>
        <p>Volendam's boats were only part of the pleasure. The real treat was watching the Dutch sky, with clouds rapidly bunching and dispersing, hiding and revealing the sun. A sailboat glided into a sunlit sliver of sea that darkened to black as a cloud bank swept across.</p>
        <p>My daughter, Anne, who lives near Utrecht, advised us to go in the morning when the town was likely to be most tranquil, and it was relatively deserted (on weekends, it is a popular excursion from Amsterdam).</p>
        <p>After watching the boats, we boarded the half-empty ferry for the 30-minute ride to Marken, an island until 1957, when it was joined to the mainland by a causeway. Creating the causeway provoked outrage among Marken's independent and ecologically minded citizens. The deeply religious Calvinist population lives a life somewhat less removed from that of its mainland counterparts than it once was. The 3,000 inhabitants used to support themselves as fishermen; today many commute from their small wooden homes to surrounding towns to work in a variety of trades. The day I visited, the tiny town was quiet, and there was little traffic. Residents have all painted  their wooden homes either a somber green or black. But the interiors of the little two-story houses are generally bright yellow and blue.</p>
        <p>Marken, which is ringed by ice in winter, had no electricity or heat until 40 years ago, and in the Marker Museum, a spare, small house museum at the port, the rigors of that earlier era are made clear. Delft tiles telling biblical stories surround the fireplace from floor to ceiling. The family depended on heat from the stove, and all slept in a single room: the parents on the top of a double-decker bed, and the children in a small bed beneath them.</p>
        <p>It is the queen's custom to visit one Dutch town on her birthday each year. The guide, who was dressed in the traditional long gown with a lace bodice, explained proudly that three years ago Queen Beatrix had chosen to visit Marken.</p>
        <p>Though the weather was clear, the winds were so strong that the hot chocolate on the ferry going back was welcome, even in summer.</p>
        <p>From Volendam, it was only a two-mile drive to Edam, home of Edam cheese. Tour buses usually include Edam in their trips. We drove, but the buses that leave Amsterdam's Central train station every half hour for Volendam go on to Edam, which is also a port. If you have the inclination, you can rent a bicycle and peddle your way as many Dutch do.</p>
        <p>Edam is far wealthier than Volendam or Marken, and the houses that line its main canal are substantial stone residences, though some tilt slightly. Just across the broad arched pedestrian bridge on Damplein -- the main square -- stands the Speeltheatre, an 18th-century building that recalls the town's once lively cultural life.</p>
        <p>Edam's history began in the 12th century,  when the Dutch settled along the little Ye River -- hence ''Yedam.'' In its heyday as a shipbuilding center, Edam's shipyard built the Halve Mann used by Henry Hudson on his 1609 foray to find a northern route to the Orient. He ended instead on the island of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Local stores will arrange to ship cheese almost anywhere in the world, but before addressing any shipping slips, we tasted (at no charge) a number of varieties of Edam at one of the several cheese stores along the Damplein. The most prevalent Edam here comes in a yellow wrapper and has a far sharper flavor than the red-packaged version that is a staple in the United States. My favorite was the aged Edam. The wedge we bought was gone by the time we returned to Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>If Volendam and Marken are quiet counterpoints to Amsterdam, Haarlem is a sophisticated but diminutive version of its larger neighbor and has become a popular residential area for wealthy Dutch who work in Amsterdam. We made the half-hour drive by car, but trains leave Amsterdam's Central Station every 10 minutes for the 20-minute trip.</p>
        <p>The landscape painters Salomon van Ruysdael and his nephew Jacob van Ruisdael (who spelled their surnames differently) were born here. And Frans Hals spent most of his career in Haarlem, painting everyone from the local power elite to common folk in the pubs. Today there is a good-sized museum in Haarlem that houses nine important  Hals paintings.</p>
        <p>The sprawling main square, where one is likely to see residents arrive on bicycles built for two, is just five minutes from the train station. It sits in the shadow of St. Bavo, a church built between 1400 and 1550, the successor to one first mentioned in 1313.  Though its exterior is dark and foreboding, the interior is surprisingly light with white stone walls and 24 massive columns. It is dominated by an organ built in 1738 by Christian Muller, which has a special mystique because Mozart played it on a visit to Haarlem in 1766. Lovers of organ music can check with the church for a schedule of recitals, which are fairly frequent.</p>
        <p>The square boasts a fish market and a town hall. But before stopping for coffee or lunch, meander over to the Frans Hals Museum. The former orphanage, converted to a museum in 1913, is built around a garden with  clipped hedges and orange trees.</p>
        <p>The museum's great cache is a series of five Hals portraits of the men who were then part of the local civil guards -- hung in a single room. The subjects exhibit the robust energy and optimism that is the hallmark of Hals's work. Unfortunately they are hung so far above eye level it is difficult to examine them closely.</p>
        <p>My favorite was Hals's group portrait of the Governesses of the Oudemannenhuis, an old men's house in Hals's day. That portrait is in a separate room where the only sound was the whirring of the humidifier as I studied the mean-spirited faces of the women who once ran the hospice. Indeed, so nasty are their expressions that it was long believed, incorrectly, that Hals had been under their supervision as a patient. However, he did paint the group portrait when he was more than 80 years old, in 1664.</p>
        <p>The museum also houses portraits by other artists of the Netherlands of the period including Jan Verspronck, Jan van Scorel and Cornelis Cornelisz, offering a chance to study how Hals was influenced by his predecessors and contemporaries -- and in relative peace and quiet.</p>
        <p>Following the winding Spaarne River brings you to the oldest museum in the Netherlands, founded by a wealthy Mennonite silk merchant and banker, Pieter Teijler. The Mennonites believed in accumulating wealth, if it was used for noble causes. Teijler's will created a foundation to promote religion, encouragement of the arts and sciences and help for the poor. The Teylers Museum, built shortly after the patron's death in 1778, houses his collection of fossils, metals, scientific instruments, books and drawings by Raphael, Rembrandt and Michelangelo, among others.</p>
        <p>Those with an interest in science  will like the heliograph, an astronomical telescope built in 1874 to observe and photograph the transition of Venus over the Sun. It is housed in the most charming room of the museum, a double-story space with a library on the second floor.</p>
        <p>Like the Frans Hals Museum, this one fits easily into its neighborhood, so that a visitor can sit in the pleasant cafe and look across the backyard into neighboring houses, some still cheerfully uncurtained as they were in the 17th century.</p>
        <p>From the Teylers, it is only a short walk to the train station, but I was tempted to stop by the Hals Museum once more. While Marken had a naive charm, Volandam some lovely vistas, Edam its prosperous homes and its cheeses, Haarlem offered both charm and the chance to ponder some of the great art of the Netherlands in welcome tranquillity.</p>

        <p>Correction:  August 13, 2000, Sunday  A picture caption on July 30 with an article about excursions from Amsterdam misidentified an inset of St. Bavo's church in Haarlem, the Netherlands. It showed the pipes of an organ, not columns. (The organ is known because Mozart played on it.)</p>
