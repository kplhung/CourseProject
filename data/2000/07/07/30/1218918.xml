        <p>Vice President Al Gore plans to announce his choice of a running mate on Tuesday, Aug. 8, campaign aides said today.</p>
        <p>The date, five days after the Republican convention in Philadelphia and a week before the Democratic convention in Los Angeles on Aug. 14, will kick off a three-week road show during which Mr. Gore hopes to dominate the news and establish momentum for the fall campaign.</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore plans to announce his choice of a running mate on Tuesday, Aug. 8, campaign aides said today.</p>
        <p>The date, five days after the Republican convention in Philadelphia and a week before the Democratic convention in Los Angeles on Aug. 14, will kick off a three-week road show during which Mr. Gore hopes to dominate the news and establish momentum for the fall campaign.</p>
        <p>It is somewhat unusual for a presidential candidate to announce in advance when he is going to announce his choice of a running mate. But the Gore campaign hopes to set up a stark contrast with what it perceives as the haphazard atmosphere of Gov. George W. Bush's selection of Dick Cheney. Mr. Gore's campaign spokesman, Chris Lehane, described that atmosphere as ''carnival-like.''</p>
        <p>By setting a date for the announcement, Gore aides said they hoped that voters would perceive Mr. Gore as making this  decision in a mature, methodical manner -- and, by extension, that they would perceive Mr. Bush as not ready to occupy the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>Karen P. Hughes, chief spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, criticized the announcement. ''Once again, everything is a political calculation,'' Ms. Hughes said. ''They are more concerned about the political timing of the announcement instead of who the person will be.''</p>
        <p>The announcement is scheduled for Nashville, where Mr. Gore's headquarters are. The new ticket will then almost certainly head to the running mate's home state. From there the two will travel through the battleground states, separating at some point. Mr. Gore is not scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles until Wednesday, Aug. 16, two days after the convention opens. Just before then, he will conduct a ''passing of the torch'' ceremony with President Clinton so that Mr. Gore can enter Los Angeles as his own man.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Gore said today during a walk on the beach with his family that he had still not settled on a running mate, although he has given strong indications that he is close to a decision. He told reporters earlier that there were fewer than 10 people on his list; the list is believed to be much smaller than that.</p>
        <p>Asked if he had made his choice, Mr. Gore said today, ''Not yet, we're just having a good time.'' Aides said he had been swimming and working on a jigsaw puzzle as he and his family began a weeklong vacation at the five-bedroom seaside home of Parker and Becky Overton, the Greenville couple who own a sporting goods business and have been longtime friends of the Gores.</p>
        <p>The home is on Figure Eight Island, a guarded, gated community with no commercial development just north of Wrightsville Beach, where outsiders are stopped at a small bridge. Other homeowners include the actors Kim Basinger, Alec Baldwin and Andy Griffith.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore told reporters as he flew here  that he was actively ''mulling'' his choice but would probably not reach a final decision until after he returned to Washington on Thursday. The ''mulling'' process itself is meant to contrast with what Gore aides characterize as a frantic scramble for Mr. Bush and an incomplete vetting of Mr. Cheney that left him unprepared for an immediate assault from Democrats on his voting record.</p>
        <p>The Gore team says that for the first time in the long preconvention positioning, the Cheney selection has given it an important assist in illustrating Mr. Bush's weaknesses and Mr. Gore's strengths.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers, while conceding they are generally in the dark as to whom he might pick, have given a couple of clues as to what may be guiding his thinking over the next several days.</p>
        <p>As they critique the Cheney choice, they focus on two things. They say that Mr. Cheney is a ''retro'' candidate from the past and that ''the visuals'' -- of an older white man with a history of heart trouble -- hurt Mr. Bush. The suggestion is that Mr. Gore will pick someone young and fresh and that the pictures of the two together will immediately convey a positive sense of vigor and energy. Mr. Gore is almost certainly guided by the instant lift his own selection gave Bill Clinton in 1992.</p>
        <p>''You want the first thing people say to be positive and be something you can build on,'' one Gore strategist said. ''That's the problem Bush has been having -- they've been on the defensive the whole week. You want the kickoff to be something powerful that carries you for the first 48 to 72 hours. This issue stuff is hurting Cheney. What's left is the picture.''</p>
        <p>Rather than go for a niche candidate who would help with a specific state or a specific group, Mr. Gore is believed to be seeking someone who would reinforce his own strengths in much the way that he reinforced Mr. Clinton's. Both came from the South, the ideological center of the party and the same age group, and they proved that reinforcement rather than balance could be a winning formula.</p>
