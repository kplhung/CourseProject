        <p>Training camp is pro football's laboratory, a testing ground with an inherent contradiction to its objective.</p>
        <p>Training camp is like hammering a molten piece of steel. It is a violent undertaking, for the steel has to be struck to take shape. Hit it too often or too forcefully, and it may break or crumble.</p>
        <p>Football coaches spend the six weeks of training camp and the attendant exhibition game schedule seeking such balance as they try to prepare and evaluate nearly 80 players for the hotbed of conflict that approaches with September's regular season. To do so, they must push and prod, occasionally letting 300-pound bodies slam into each other just to see what happens, to see who moves backward and who does not.</p>
        <p>They must let their prized running backs be thrown to the ground, let their quarterbacks be sacked and their linebackers be blocked at the knees.</p>
        <p>And yet, what coaches want most out of training camp is a healthy roster of players. So they spend a far greater amount of time trying to protect the players -- their multimillion-dollar inventory -- from colliding with each other in hazardous circumstances.</p>
        <p>The words heard most frequently at Giants training camp is the plaintive bellow of Coach Jim Fassel: ''Stay up! Stay up!''</p>
        <p>Fassel shouts this as nearly every practice play concludes. He does so to prevent his backs, ends and linemen from losing their footing, leading to a pileup of mammoth bodies. It is in those pileups, as arms and legs tangle, that ligaments are strained and torn and bones give way.</p>
        <p>''Stay up!'' Fassel yells 40 or 50 times a practice.</p>
        <p>Once in a while, someone does not stay up.</p>
        <p>Wednesday at Giants camp, it was Dhani Jones, a promising rookie linebacker. For days beforehand, Jones had brought smiles to the faces of Giants coaches, who talked about how they had stolen a talented player with a sixth-round pick in April's draft.</p>
        <p>Jones was fast and big at 240 pounds and he displayed a special athletic quality that made him stand out. In football parlance, he was ''always around the ball.''</p>
        <p>But running down on a drill simulating a kickoff, Jones paused, went to change direction on grass wet from a morning rain, and slumped to the ground. He got up, but the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee -- the stabilizer of side-to-side motion -- was not attached as it had been seconds earlier.</p>
        <p>Jones will be lost for the season and faces six months of grueling rehabilitation.</p>
        <p>''It just shows you how life can change from moment to moment,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>It was reminiscent of a similar knee injury sustained by the former Giants wide receiver Omar Douglas running virtually the same drill during the team's 1997 training camp. Douglas did not get up and never played again for the Giants.</p>
        <p>As Douglas lay in the grass that summer day, his career changed forever in a moment, his helmet was next to an orange traffic cone the coaches were using to mark the spot where players made their cuts for the drill.</p>
        <p>As trainers worked on a writhing Douglas, a coach walked over, grabbed the cone and moved it five yards to the right. A whistle blew. The drill continued.</p>
        <p>A few months later, when that scene was recounted to Douglas, he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
        <p>''It may seem heartless,'' he said, ''but it's just football.''</p>
        <p>Last week, it was obvious the Giants coaches were shaken by Jones's injury. It was apparent in their faces when they discussed the loss of a talented player. And this year, Fassel has made his training camp less rigorous. There have been several days with just one practice when there had been two sessions in the past. Full-contact exercises have been scant.</p>
        <p>''But it's a no-win situation,'' Fassel said. ''If you don't work the guys and have injuries, people will say you didn't do enough to get them in condition. It's a fine balance and it's on my mind 24 hours a day: are we working them too little or too much?''</p>
        <p>Fassel and his head trainer, Ronnie Barnes, sat down this winter and examined the circumstances of every injury from the 1999 season, from sprains to broken bones. ''We had a lot of broken bones in games,'' Fassel said. ''Now what are you going to do about that? Sometimes a guy just steps wrong. That's what Dhani did. It happens.</p>
        <p>''After that injury, I was concerned about the coaching staff. So I told them: 'Look, we can't get paranoid out there. We can't be walking around on eggshells.' ''</p>
        <p>As Fassel spoke, he stood alongside the acres of practice fields where he is molding his fourth Giants team. He pointed to a group of tight ends who were doing extra work after practice on a distant field.</p>
        <p>A machine was firing footballs at the players. As each player tried to catch a ball, a coach slammed him across the shoulder pads and helmet with a padded blocking dummy.</p>
        <p>Fassel, a football coach for 27 years, took in this scene. With a thin smile, he turned away.</p>
        <p>''It's a tough game,'' he said.</p>
