        <p>In an unusual alliance, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association is joining the New York Civil Liberties Union and groups representing black and Hispanic police officers to discuss their concerns about the Police Department's possible monitoring of the groups, which are often critical of the department.</p>
        <p>The groups are planning to hold a news conference today to release a letter they have written to Police Commissioner Howard Safir about some of the department's activities in connection with them.</p>
        <p>''The Civil Liberties Union has always been and continues to be concerned about the possible surveillance of political activities, and we will raise serious and substantial questions about it at the press conference tomorrow,'' said Norman Siegel, executive director of the civil liberties group.</p>
        <p>The organizations that Mr. Siegel and the police union think have come under scrutiny are 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care and the Latino Officers Association. The heads of the two organizations, Lt. Eric Adams and Lt. Anthony Miranda, respectively, will also attend the news conference, Mr. Siegel said.</p>
        <p>This month, a senior commander in the department's Internal Affairs Bureau, testifying in an unrelated civil lawsuit, revealed that two inquiries had been conducted into 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement and its president, Lieutenant Adams. While the official, Deputy Chief Raymond King, said the investigations had been closed without any finding of wrongdoing, the disclosure raised questions about why they had been conducted.</p>
        <p>As part of the investigations, Lieutenant Adams was followed and his telephone records obtained, police officials said.</p>
        <p>The letter to Commissioner Safir praises him for his willingness to meet Lieutenant Adams to discuss the investigations, but suggests that other police officials, presumably without his knowledge, have been monitoring the groups' activities. The letter, which is signed by Mr. Siegel, Lieutenant Adams, Lieutenant Miranda and Greg Longworth, a P.B.A. attorney, cites the department's consistent monitoring of news conferences held by the groups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Siegel would not comment on the contents of the letter yesterday, saying he did not wish to discuss it before it was delivered to Mr. Safir today. A police spokesman said the department would have no comment until Mr. Safir saw the letter.</p>
        <p>The alliance of the normally conservative police union and Mr. Siegel, one of the city's most persistent and vocal critics of department practices, comes as the union is locked in bitter contract negotiations with the city.</p>
        <p>''We're very pleased that the P.B.A. has agreed to appear at the press conference tomorrow,'' Mr. Siegel said, adding, ''We believe that their involvement with the black and Latino groups sends a strong message of unanimity on a fundamental question about possibly problematic N.Y.P.D. practices.''</p>
