        <p>To the discordant sounds of halyards slapping against masts and sirens screeching down Storrow Drive last Wednesday, 11-year-old Brad Louw hauled in on the mainsheet, swung the tiller over and instructed me to shove off. With a cold, unseasonable northeast breeze filling the well-used sail of our ancient but shipshape Cape Cod Mercury, Brad set a course down the gray Charles River in Boston.</p>
        <p>As he eased the sheet expertly to spill a 15-knot gust, it was hard to believe Brad had been sailing for less than two months. But something in my movements did not inspire a corresponding sense of confidence. ''So,'' Brad wondered, ''have you ever sailed before?''</p>

        <p>To the discordant sounds of halyards slapping against masts and sirens screeching down Storrow Drive last Wednesday, 11-year-old Brad Louw hauled in on the mainsheet, swung the tiller over and instructed me to shove off. With a cold, unseasonable northeast breeze filling the well-used sail of our ancient but shipshape Cape Cod Mercury, Brad set a course down the gray Charles River in Boston.</p>
        <p>As he eased the sheet expertly to spill a 15-knot gust, it was hard to believe Brad had been sailing for less than two months. But something in my movements did not inspire a corresponding sense of confidence. ''So,'' Brad wondered, ''have you ever sailed before?''</p>
        <p>Had there been a free moment, I would have regaled the boy with my sea tales. In that instant, however, Brad was smartly bearing away to cut astern of a close-hauled Mercury with another urchin in command. As for sea stories, he was too busy amassing his own.</p>
        <p>For over six decades at the full-service boathouse on the Charles that serves as the headquarters of Community Boating Inc., countless sailors of all ages have been logging similar personal adventures. Today, those between the ages of 10 and 18 can follow Brad's example and take advantage of the best deal in boating. Early last month, having just moved to the States with his family from South Africa, he walked in and plunked down a dollar, which paid for a summer's worth of lessons, boat rentals and experiences.</p>
        <p>Organizations like Milwaukee Community Sailing, St. Petersburg Sailing Center in Florida, the Dana Point Youth and Group Facility in California, and the Long Shore Sailing School in Westport, Conn., all offer similar programs for youths and adults.</p>
        <p>A national directory of community sailing offerings called ''Where to Sail'' is available on the U.S. Sailing Web site (www.ussailing.org), or by calling (401) 683-0800.</p>
        <p>''In the last decade, the growth in publicly accessible sailing opportunities has been huge,'' said Kim Hapgood, the program director at Rhode Island's Sail Newport center and a member of the U.S. Sailing council on community sailing. ''An increasing number of people are attracted by the challenges sailing offers, and it also appeals to people who already like to sail but don't want to own boats.''</p>
        <p>Established in 1937 by a bullheaded, well-connected social worker named Joe Lee, Boston's Community Boating Inc. is the granddaddy of public sailing centers. Lee, who started with seven ragtag boats with sails fashioned from bedsheets, would be startled if he could see today's fleet of 75 Mercurys, 5 Sonars, 6 Rhodes 19's, and about a dozen 420's, sailboards, Lasers and kayaks, respectively.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday afternoon, with a miserable forecast better suited to an afternoon in a library or a theater, about 50 diehard kids of varied ethnic backgrounds -- down from the hundreds who would gather on a typical July day -- lingered about the docks in various degrees of soakage. Charlie Zechel, the director of instruction, didn't seem to mind the low turnout.</p>
        <p>''It's been the busiest summer here in years, and it's nice to have a little break,'' he said. ''Generally, we maintain a nice, steady state of being on the verge of chaos.''</p>
        <p>Over the course of the April-to- October season, about 1,500 junior sailors and nearly 8,000 adults will participate in Community Boating programs. A full year's membership costs $190, though short-term plans are also available. Experienced sailors can take a test that will allow them to use boats on a level commensurate with their skills.</p>
        <p>Beginners must take a five-day shore school that provides them with a Solo rating. Sailors can then earn higher ratings -- and privileges on more boats and in greater wind strengths -- with further instruction and testing at their pace.</p>
        <p>''Once someone gets to where Brad Louw is, with a couple of ratings, it's all pretty self-directed,'' Zechel said.</p>
        <p>As we sailed back to the docks, Brad's teeth were clattering. Bare-chested except for a life vest, with a rivulet of rain cascading off his nose, he had been sailing for hours before taking me out. He had turned back now only because I made him. Then he handed me the tiller and called the puffs funneling through the Longfellow Bridge. He was a natural, and he was ready for more.</p>
