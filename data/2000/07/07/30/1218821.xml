        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The suggestion (letter, July 24) by Frances Kissling, the president of Catholics for a Free Choice, that many priests in this country disagree with the Catholic Church's teaching on abortion since ''only'' 6,000 (of the country's 46,000) priests are members of the voluntary organization called Priests for Life is absurd and rebutted by independent research showing that priests overwhelmingly support church teaching on abortion.</p>

        <p>Catholics for a Free Choice deserves media scrutiny for the claims it makes. The Catholic bishops of the United States have on at least three occasions formally stated that the group is not a Catholic organization and that it does not accurately represent the Catholic faith.</p>
