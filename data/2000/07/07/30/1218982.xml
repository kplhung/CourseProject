        <p>The residents of a red-brick apartment building here say they have been in disbelief since a neighbor, Aaron Amartei Commey, was accused of boarding a National Airlines flight at Kennedy International Airport with a 10-millimeter handgun and a knife and ordering the pilots to fly to Miami, Argentina and then Antarctica.</p>
        <p>They have been searching for answers since word first spread in northeast Milwaukee that Mr. Commey had been arrested and charged with attempted air piracy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Commey, 22, a native of the Bronx who moved to Milwaukee several years ago with his mother, was arrested early Friday morning after a five-hour standoff in which the plane's passengers escaped and the pilot and co-pilot were freed.</p>
        <p>In New York, Mr. Commey has been described as a violent, calculating and brazen man who spent weeks planning the attempted hijacking.</p>
        <p>But here, although most people who knew him say he had problems, assessments have been more gentle.</p>
        <p>''He didn't seem like he was too crazy,'' said Damon Eastern, 24, who lives on the same floor as Mr. Commey in a working-class black neighborhood on the northernmost border of Milwaukee, near its more affluent suburbs of Shorewood, to the east, and Glendale, to the north.</p>
        <p>To observers in New York, Mr. Commey's actions seem delusional. In interviews with F.B.I. agents, he confessed to trying to hijack the plane, authorities said.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Commey sits in a holding cell in New York awaiting trial, the case has become a topic of discussion in churches and saloons here.</p>
        <p>The events in New York, those who knew Mr. Commey said, appeared to have been the culmination of a long series of events that had troubled relatives and friends. Mr. Commey dropped out of high school and moved to Milwaukee in 1996, when his parents divorced. His father, Samuel, who lives in Brooklyn, said he had not seen his son in about four years. ''He was not responding to the help that I was trying to give him,'' Samuel Commey said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Commey said he was trying to get his son to finish high school, but, judging from recent telephone conversations, feared that his son was suffering from an undiagnosed mental illness.</p>
        <p>A man who answered a knock at Aaron Commey's apartment yesterday said Aaron's mother, Tina, and brother Benjamin would have no comment.</p>
        <p>Friends and relatives said Aaron  Commey had long been quiet, but had become more reclusive after the move. They said he began working odd jobs at factories in the Milwaukee area, and in 1997 moved out of his mother's home and lived temporarily with Benjamin, his older brother, in a house in Kenosha, a southern suburb of Milwaukee. Less than a year later, neighbors said, Mr. Commey moved into his $325-a-month apartment on North Sixth Street.</p>
        <p>Most of his friends, neighbors said, were from outside the area. They included many whites -- somewhat unusual in this area, neighbors said, who worked with him at several factories.</p>
        <p>''He has been around a little while, but did not come in here much,'' said Houton Wilson, 55, the owner of one of two bars a block away from the apartment building. ''Things have been up and down here and we are back up,'' Mr. Wilson said of the neighborhood. ''This is all we need.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Commey's room was sparsely decorated and filled with bags of trash, neighbors said. Although reclusive, he did not stand out, said Tony Parker, 22, a neighbor, though noting that Mr. Commey often seemed like a social misfit and a conspiracy theorist.</p>
        <p>Those conspiracies began to dominate his life in recent years, said one relative who did not want his name used.</p>
        <p>Mr. Commey began to talk about how the government had been cloning humans for decades, offering theories seeming to mirror those on ''The X-Files,'' a television show. Indeed, investigators said Mr. Commey told the pilots and negotiators that he believed that humans were being cloned. Later, he told them he wanted to go to Antarctica, the site of several secret government bases and landing strips for human-alien hybrid cloning in ''The X-Files.''</p>
        <p>Four weeks ago, officials say, he began planning to hijack a plane in New York. He quit his job at a factory a week later. ''He told us about that,'' Mr. Eastern said, ''that he was looking for a new job, he was not making enough money.''</p>
        <p>But officials said Mr. Commey never found a new job and spent much of his time planning the hijacking and collecting weapons.</p>
        <p>The next week, Milwaukee police detectives appeared at the apartment building looking for someone who fit Mr. Commey's description. ''The detectives pulled me over outside,'' Mr. Eastern said. ''They asked me if I knew somebody a little shorter than me with an Afro who lived in the building. I lied and told them I did not know anything. But he was the only one who fit the description.''</p>
        <p>Milwaukee police officials declined to comment on why they were looking for Mr. Commey.</p>
        <p>Last Tuesday morning, Mr. Commey took a city bus near his home to the bus terminal in downtown Milwaukee. Mr. Parker said he remembered seeing Mr. Commey leave that morning -- in the same white shirt and black pants he was arrested in -- carrying a brown paper bag and a large duffel bag. Mr. Commey caught a Greyhound bus for a 20-hour ride to New York, arriving Wednesday about 10:20 a.m., according to the authorities.</p>
        <p>About 10:25 p.m. Thursday, Mr. Commey boarded National Airlines Flight 19, a Boeing 757 bound for Las Vegas, after pointing his handgun at security workers. After police negotiators persuaded him to get off the plane they immediately began retracing his steps, and found his duffel bag -- with a shotgun, about 20 shells and two additional knives -- in a locker at the Port Authority Bus Terminal.</p>
