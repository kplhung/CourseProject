        <p>Julio Cesar Chavez lasted longer tonight than many had feared, but he was still unable to reverse time, losing a sixth-round technical knockout to the World Boxing Council superlightweight champion, Kostya Tszyu. It may well end the long career of the 38-year-old Chavez, one of boxing's great warriors.</p>
        <p>After a somewhat uneventful start, Tszyu dominated the fifth round and took that momentum into the next, striking Chavez on the head with one powerful blow after another. The fight was stopped precisely in the middle of the round. Nobody could reasonably dispute the decision.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the near-capacity crowd at Veterans Memorial Coliseum was disappointed. They were strongly pro-Chavez, waving Mexican flags and cheering the man who had been their hero for almost two decades. Still, their passionate support could not alter the reality that Chavez is long past his prime while Tszyu, who was born in Russian and now lives in Australia, has a most promising future. By outdueling a legend in Chavez, even one with diminished skills, Tszyu may receive the recognition that has eluded him.</p>
        <p>Many had argued that Chavez should never have had the chance to face Tszyu in the first place. One of those, Senator John McCain, architect of the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, went so far as to send a letter to Gov. Jane Hull of Arizona to express his misgivings, calling the bout an illegitimate and potentially dangerous mismatch.</p>
        <p>Chavez, according to the fight's numerous critics, did not deserve to be ranked as the top contender, which is what made the bout mandatory. He had not fought a top 10 contender in more than a year and had been soundly defeated last October by the journeyman Willy Wise in a 10-round decision. Moreover, many voiced concerns that Chavez, a six-time champion in three weight classes, might get seriously hurt by the powerful Tszyu, who is eight years younger.</p>
        <p>Despite such widespread skepticism, the fight was not canceled. The three-member Arizona Boxing Commission, after hearing testimony that included a strong plea from Chavez, voted in June to grant him a license. Its approval came despite indications that the Nevada Athletic Commission had not been prepared to sanction the fight, which was originally slated for July 15 in Las Vegas. That is why promoters switched the fight to Phoenix.</p>
        <p>However, John Montano, executive director of the Arizona commission, pointed out that Chavez had passed a physical examination with the state's ringside physician and successfully underwent a series of neurological tests. ''I don't see any reason not to hold the fight,'' Montano said at the time.</p>
        <p>For his part, Chavez told the commission that the Tszyu fight would be his last. ''Let me go out with dignity and honor,'' he said. Not surprisingly, though, Chavez have had reportedly backed away from that pledge in recent  days. After tonight's performance, however, Chavez, who had boldly predicted he would knock out Tszyu by the eighth round, will likely reconsider.</p>
        <p>An earlier match between Hector Camacho Jr., the unbeaten World Boxing Association superlightweight champion, and the International Boxing Federation lightweight title-holder, Philip Holiday, had its share of controversy. Camacho won a technical decision in the sixth round when Holiday was hit on the head accidentally by Camacho's elbow. Blood poured from his eye, and he could not continue. In that situation, whichever fighter ahead on the judges scorecard's is declared the winner.</p>
        <p>''The referee should have disqualified him from hitting me with an elbow,'' Holiday said. ''I felt I was just starting to take over like I planned. Anybody that knows me knows I start to pick it up after the seventh round.''</p>
        <p>Camacho, 21, saw it differently.</p>
        <p>''He brought his head in too low and my hook caught him,'' said Camacho, who improved to 29-0.</p>
