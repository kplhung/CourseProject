        <p>FROM time to time, very smart people do things that aren't so smart. Just ask the folks at Time Warner, who are probably ruing their decision to play hardball with Walt Disney's ABC television network during the May sweeps period.</p>
        <p>Time Warner made headlines then by bouncing ABC off its cable systems in a number of large markets. The dispute was soon resolved, but sour memories lingered. Last week, at hearings before the Federal Communications Commission, Disney and other big media companies repaid Time Warner's aggressiveness by voicing objections to its huge pending merger with America Online.</p>
        <p>Tom Burnett, president of Merger Insight, a New York-based institutional research service, offered some thoughts last week on the huge deal and its prospects. Here are excerpts.</p>
        <p>Q.  How much damage did Time Warner inflict on itself through the spat with Disney?</p>
        <p>A.  The odds that regulators would take a very serious look at the AOL deal went up because of what happened in May. That event lit a fire under Congress, which is bad. And it forced the F.C.C. to recognize that whoever controls the cable network controls access to the customer. Time Warner's decision to deny Disney access graphically demonstrated how important it is to put mechanisms in place that will give competing content suppliers access.</p>
        <p>Q. To ensure that that happens, Disney and NBC want the F.C.C. to make Time Warner separate its cable systems from its content business before it approves the AOL deal. Is that likely?</p>
        <p>A. Forcing a spinoff would be a deal killer, but we don't see any need for that draconian a measure. Still, rules may have to be put in place to ensure that networks and other competing content suppliers are not blocked from access.</p>
        <p>The best way to do that is with F.C.C. rule-making. You don't want these rules to be written by local cable franchise authorities. You want them written and enforced on a national level, so you get consistency.</p>
        <p>Q. What else might the F.C.C. mandate that could scuttle the deal?</p>
        <p>A. Restrictions that prevent cross-selling opportunities is a possible problem -- preventing Time Warner from sending an e-mail to all AOL subscribers offering them a discounted subscription to Sports Illustrated, for example.</p>
        <p>Q. When the deal was announced in January, it was wildly applauded, but since then opinion seems to have soured. What happened?</p>
        <p>A. AOL's stock is definitely down. But companies like Amazon.com, eBay and Yahoo are down, too, and we have had a huge overall correction in Nasdaq stock prices. It could also be that the market is having trouble dealing with the concept of this merger. It is not a complete numbers game, like a merger between two energy companies. You are dealing with concepts like pushing magazines out through the Internet, areas where we don't have a lot of experience.</p>
        <p>Q. The F.C.C. has had the deal under review for months; the Federal Trade Commission and the European Union are also looking at it. When can decisions be expected?</p>
        <p>A. We had been told it would close by the end of the year, but processing it could take longer than we thought. Technically, the F.C.C. has only about 75 days left to make its decision, but it can delay that by asking for more information. The European timetable is mid-October, but Time Warner's decision to form a music joint venture with EMI Group has run into opposition, so there could be further delays.</p>
        <p>But the out date for the merger agreement is not until May 31, 2001. That means the companies left themselves plenty of time.</p>
        <p>Q. Is it likely that Congress is going to take a whack at the deal as well?</p>
        <p>A. We expect there will be hearings sometime this fall, and a little bit of criticism of Gerald Levin, Time Warner's chairman, about the Disney matter. But we don't expect to see any legislation. Normally, one merger will not prompt Congress to pass a bill. But Congressional scrutiny does put pressure on the F.C.C. and the F.T.C. to conduct a more thorough review.</p>
        <p>Q. What is your attitude about the combination, if it is approved?</p>
        <p>A. On balance, we don't love the transaction or hate it.</p>
        <p>But we haven't seen a lot of clients jump into either of these stocks. We have people who are watching it carefully, but not many who want to get involved in the combined company.</p>
        <p>That said, we have seen a lot of AOL holders sell out since the deal was announced, because they thought the new company would be a big, boring 5 percent revenue grower. Those clients will probably pile back in to AOL if the deal is blocked by regulators.</p>
