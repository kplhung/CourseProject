        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>There is nothing uglier than a string of telephone poles covered with wires, yet we all accept them as a necessity of modern society (the worthy exception being the Amish). Actually, most of us don't even notice the tangle of wires disfiguring our villages because our brains kindly filter out this visual pollution. Cell phone towers are actually an improvement on this 100-year-old eyesore, yet people continue to resist their construction [''Cell Tower Plans Stir Neighbors,'' July 23].</p>
        <p>The simple fact is that wireless technology is a basic component of the digital infrastructure. They will be built because people want cell phones, and cell phone technology gets cheaper every day. In fact, I expect to disconnect my wired phone before long. Given the inevitability of wireless communications, it is curious that the county government has not developed a plan for its orderly implementation in an effort to lower cost, reduce its environmental/aesthetic impact and ensure that all communities get equal coverage.</p>
