        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Celestine Bohlen's article on Valery Gergiev and St. Petersburg's White Nights Festival [''Long Nights, Longer Days, All Filled With Music,'' July 16] speaks of the Kirov's financial problems and of the goals of its artistic director. Indeed, Russia can bring much to the West, and Mr. Gergiev is to be praised for retrieving Russia's operatic heritage. But my recent trip to the Maryinsky (for a performance of that 90-year-old production of ''Ruslan and Ludmila'') taught me that Russia does not need ''to reintegrate itself with the West.'' What St. Petersburg needs to do to attract Westerners to its opera is to make its opera house and its city amenable to Western operagoers: a more efficient box office; elimination of the two-tiered ticketing policy by which foreigners pay many times more than Russians for the same seats; seats that are attached to the floor so that one does not migrate to another row by the end of the performance; and enforcement of reserved seating to avoid the ''musical chairs'' upgrading that takes place at intermissions. In the time-honored tradition, the Maryinsky could offer snacks or drinks at intermission as a moneymaker. But most critical, St. Petersburg's nouveau riche audience must stop talking through performances and children in the orchestra must be taught not to yell to friends in the rings above. Does Mr. Gergiev believe that the Metropolitan Opera wants to perform in such an atmosphere?</p>
