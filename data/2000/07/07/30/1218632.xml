        <p>WHEN the Hofmeyer family bought the decrepit Biltmore apartment building on West Fourth Street in downtown Cincinnati in 1990 and two years later the Lombardi, a historic but condemned apartment building on an adjacent lot, banks balked at loans to update the units. Housing in the city's central business district was in a downward spiral. Parking was scarce. There was no grocery, and few young professionals were ready to live in a Midwestern downtown.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Max and Angela Hofmeyer and their five sons, who own a plumbing company, concluded that their out-of-pocket investment in upgrading the two distressed buildings would pay off.</p>
        <p>Mr. and Mrs. Hofmeyer -- both are now 68 -- sold their house on two acres in a suburban neighborhood on the west side of town, and at an age when many Americans would be looking to retire to a beach community  became part of a Cincinnati back-to-the-city movement, living in one of the buildings that they were refurbishing.</p>
        <p>They knew there would be challenges. After all, the Biltmore was half-occupied and four of the 28 apartments had never been completed after a previous attempt at renovation. The family was confident, however, that the building could be returned to its former glory. There were tall ceilings, white marble hallways, exposed brick walls and distinctive windows in a building that at one time had been a coveted address.</p>
        <p>''There was risk, but we knew felt comfortable knowing that after a lot of work we would have quality apartments, and quality apartments will have renters,'' said their son Paul, who helped update kitchens and bathrooms in both buildings.</p>
        <p>Because of investors like the Hofmeyers -- and heavy public subsidies for other projects -- the population of the square-mile Cincinnati Central Business District has reached levels not seen for decades.</p>
        <p>The population increase is similar to the trend back to downtown that has been noted in other cities across the nation. Eugenie Birch, who heads the department of city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, has compared housing trends in 40 American cities from 1990 to 1999 and found that one in four have returned to 1970 population levels.</p>
        <p>In her 1999 study, ''Downtown Living: A Deeper Look,'' she reported that Cincinnati had one of the more robust markets for downtown housing in the nation.</p>
        <p>She estimated that 4,810 people lived downtown in 1999, up from 3,838 in 1990. Kathy Schwab, residential development adviser to Downtown Cincinnati Inc., a nonprofit group, said that there were about 2,100 housing units downtown, with 10 or so buildings restored or converted, five more under construction and two projects in development.</p>
        <p>''What people were reflecting anecdotally -- that more people were moving back downtown - was really happening in some cities like Cincinnati,'' Professor Birch said. ''This is a fragile trend that has happened for a lot of reasons. People want to walk to work. They like an urban life with all its attachments: good restaurants, theater and art museums.''</p>
        <p>''They are living in lofts, converted factories,'' she added. ''It's a lifestyle choice.''</p>
        <p>Professor Birch initiated her study when she reviewed a 1998 report by the Brookings Institution and Fannie Mae, the federally chartered mortgage financing corporation, that showed many American cities expected to see a healthy increase in downtown housing. In that report, however, Cincinnati was not in the top tier. Planners had projected that only 3,500 people would be living in the central business district by 2010, about the same number they thought were living downtown in Columbus and Pittsburgh today. But that study of 26 cities did not have fixed central business district boundaries,  and planners had estimated downtown boundaries and populations.</p>
        <p>While Professor Birch thought that the methodology of the report could be sharpened, she agreed with the finding that there was a broad trend of people moving back to downtown. IN preparing her study, she focused on the growth in the number of downtown households, and restricted the geographical scope of the report to core blocks. Instead of relying on rough estimates by local planners, she bought data from Claritas, a company that specializes in demographic and economic data. Cities with downtowns that posted significant gains, according to her study, included Dallas, Denver, Colorado Springs, Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., and Portland, Ore.</p>
        <p>The Hofmeyers never regretted their move from suburbia to downtown, though they have now returned to a suburb to be closer to grandchildren. ''We had a rooftop deck with views of downtown and the river,'' Mrs. Hofmeyer said. ''But at the beginning friends told us we were nuts.''</p>
        <p>The Hofmeyers' two buildings had a waiting list until earlier this year, when some tenants fled because of inconveniences from the construction of a new football stadium for the Cincinnati Bengals about three blocks south. Seven vacancies resulted, all of which have since been filled, although the waiting list is a thing of the past, at least for now. Other buildings where young and single tenants live include a former cigar warehouse called East Eighth Lofts, where all 45 units were rented in 60 days last fall. Other apartments have gone into the former Shillito Department Store.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Bonner, a professor of art at Northern Kentucky University, moved into East Eighth Lofts last fall after spurning ''cookie-cutter'' complexes in nearby suburbs. The central location means he spends less for gasoline and has a manageable commute to the university six miles south. Also, he said, he is not contributing to urban sprawl, though the lack of a grocery downtown remains an inconvenience. He pays $670 a month in rent, which does not include utilities, and $120 a month for two parking spots.</p>
        <p>''I bet half the people in the building are lawyers, doctors or professionals,'' Mr. Bonner said. ''I love it downtown: to walk out the door and see an opening at the Contemporary Arts Center or go grab something to eat.''</p>
        <p>Among the challenges for developers has been competition from other neighborhoods and the city's historically low housing costs, said Ralph D. Bolton, the former head of Cincinnati downtown development and now a principal at the architecture firm of Brashear Bolton.</p>
        <p>''There were and are very good neighborhoods close to downtown that were accessible and had relatively inexpensive housing stock and apartments,'' he said. ''What has to happen for downtown housing to be attractive is it must attract people from those neighborhoods: offer some kind of vitality and value.''</p>
        <p>Rising rents and property values in recent years in nearby neighborhoods like Clifton and Hyde Park that have long attracted young professionals has also added to the attraction of downtown housing. In the 1970's and 1980's, most housing downtown was aimed at low-income residents. Today the mix includes more upper-  and middle-income residents, and as a result restaurants and clubs are opening in long-vacant buildings.</p>
        <p>Apartments in the Biltmore and Lombardi bring $350 to $725 in rent, but that does not include $75 a month for a parking slot.</p>
        <p>A few units go for more: the rent for a two-bedroom townhouse with deck is $800 a  month and approaches $900 when parking is included. Although that may seem a bargain when compared with rents in major cities like New York and Chicago, it is pricey by Cincinnati standards.</p>
        <p>The Hofmeyers are in the market to buy another apartment building downtown, but times have changed. A nearby shell carries a $325,000 price tag -- far from the $10 that the Hofmeyers paid the city for the Lombardi nearly a decade ago.</p>
