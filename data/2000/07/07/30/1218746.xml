        <p>Kenneth A. Gibson, who became Newark's first black mayor when he headed a reform movement that defeated the scandal-ridden regime of Hugh Addonizio in 1970, was indicted along with two associates last week by a federal grand jury on charges that he bilked the Irvington School Board of ''hundreds of  thousands of dollars'' in connection with his engineering consulting firm's contract to manage a $50 million school construction and renovation program. Mr. Gibson was charged along with Camille Savoca, vice president of his Gibson Associates firm and William Bernowich, the firm's project manager on the troubled and much investigated Irvington job. They face five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted of the major charges.</p>
