        <p>TO: Marketing Committee</p>
        <p>FROM: Your Rapidly Aging Boss</p>
        <p>RE: Selling the 50's and 60's</p>
        <p>Returning to the office after lunch today, I was nearly run down by a middle-aged guy braying into a cell phone while he rolled down Lexington Avenue on a kick scooter.</p>
        <p>My first thought was that they were filming one of those Comedy Central commercials that ridicule baby boomers. But I was astonished to learn that these scooters have become all the rage, as we used to say back in those odd and ancient days when J. Edgar Hoover was considered a tough guy.</p>
        <p>Seems this latest trendlet started in Japan and spread to the San Francisco Bay area, where the Internet hyped it eastward. Kick scooters evidently sell to a bifurcated market: college kids and adults born roughly between 1946 and 1964 (O.K., and small children, too). The fad is said to be driven by baby boomer nostalgia.</p>
        <p>Well, excuuuuse me, boys and girls. Please allow a charter baby boomer (b. 1946) to provide some historical context here. I was maybe 10 when kick scooters started showing up. I forget whether this was around the time baseball gloves stopped resembling quilted oven mitts and developed useful webbing. Incidentally, how did Pee Wee Reese ever catch a grounder with one of those muffins? Anyway, what was I saying? Oh, right: Kick scooters were considered ridiculous and without practical value even in the 1950's! You know what we yelled when some kid scooted by? ''Hey, pal! Get a bike!''</p>
        <p>And do you know what I was really thinking today when I saw that 50-year-old scuffing past on a $200 designer kick scooter? Geriatric skateboard! I swear, I mulled over the idea of calling the Hemlock Society for a consultation.</p>
        <p>We aging baby boomers are constantly hearing advertisers and marketers babble about our growing irrelevance. At the same time, we've watched the popular culture that we created, as we bulged our demographic mass through the 50's, 60's and 70's, devour itself. Music, television, movies, attitudes, fashion, fads and philosophy -- marketers have strip-mined the whole baby boom landscape. We're scraping bottom now, folks. Last month it was capri pants -- remember pedal pushers? And now it's kick scooters? Give me a break! This is a culture running on fumes!</p>
        <p>But who am I to argue with the pop market? Where there is a trend, there is a fee. So let's free-associate here and tweak some other candidates for profitable exhumation from the baby boom graveyard:</p>
        <p>Think ''Betsy Wetsy Meets Depends.''</p>
        <p>Or ''The Revenge of Winky Dink.'' Remember the 1950's cartoon program that sold plastic sheets that stuck on the television screen so you could use crayon on it during the show? Imagine the fun that a Winky Dink 2000 can offer cranky boomers watching programs like ''The Capital Gang''!</p>
        <p>Try Cinerama computer monitors (three screens, thus tripling sales).</p>
        <p>Flagg Flyers 2000. Remember those 50's men's dress shoes with the leather-covered metal snap that replaced laces and were popular for about three weeks? Reposition them as safety shoes: No More Dangerous Bending Over to Tie Laces.</p>
        <p>Or appeal to the active lifestyle market and bring back beverage cans that have to be pierced with a pointy opener called a church key? Think aerobic exercise!</p>
        <p>Consider ''Mitch Miller Rapz.''</p>
        <p>Or cowboy outfits (''Draw your Palm Pilot and cell phone from them holsters, pardner!'').</p>
        <p>How about a Mental Hygiene Classroom Films Festival? Hold it in Telluride, maybe get the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to have an awards dinner honoring classics like ''Is This Love?'' (1957); ''Girls Beware'' (1961); ''Highways of Agony'' (1969); and the ''Citizen Kane'' of the classroom genre, ''Duck and Cover'' (1951).</p>
        <p>''Duck and Cover'' featured Bert, the wise cartoon turtle who warned, ''Always remember, the flash from the atomic bomb can come at any time!'' Sporting a tin-pot civil defense helmet, Bert was serenaded in the film by a jingle that suggested he was going to be O.K. in the event of a thermonuclear blast. Bert ''never got hurt,'' the jingle went, because ''he knew just what to do. He'd duck! And cover!''</p>
        <p>I've decided to skip this afternoon's marketing meeting. Just brainstorm on your own, folks. Afterward, anybody who wants to do some strategizing, I'll be home, sipping a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon in my fallout shelter.</p>
