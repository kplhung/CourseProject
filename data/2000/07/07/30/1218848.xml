        <p>THIS year's most honored young-adult novel, ''Monster,'' grabs the 12-and-up crowd from the very first sentence: ''The best time to cry is at night, when the lights are out and someone is being beaten up and screaming for help.''</p>
        <p>Walter Dean Myers's story of a boy in jail, charged with taking part in a convenience-store killing, was a finalist for the National Book Award, and the first winner of the American Library Association's new prize for the burgeoning category of young-adult fiction, an honor created as a sort of big brother to the group's prestigious Newbery and Caldecott Medals.</p>
        <p>It's a long way from ''Anne of Green Gables,'' or, for that matter, Harry Potter -- but, in its grimness, not too far removed from many of the new young-adult books.</p>
        <p>Another National Book Award finalist last year, ''Speak,'' by Laurie Halse Anderson, concerns a ninth-grade girl who has been an outcast, and almost mute, since an end-of-summer party where she got drunk, was raped, and called the police.</p>
        <p>This is by no means a brand new genre. Ever since the 1970's, young-adult novels have featured a parade of America's dysfunctional. And early on, there was a great hue and cry about Judy Blume's books, with their frank discussion of sex, and Robert Cormier's books, which dropped the happy ending. But just in the last four years, young-adult fiction has moved into ever bleaker territory. For example:</p>
        <p>*''The Facts Speak for Themselves,'' Brock Cole's book about a 13-year-old girl whose adult lover is shot, in front of her, by her mother's boyfriend, who then shoots himself.</p>
        <p>*''Smack,'' Melvin Burgess's story of two British teenage runaways who move into a ''squat'' and take up heroin.</p>
        <p>*''Edge,'' Michael Cadnum's tale of a high-school dropout whose divorced, upper-middle-class father is shot in the neck while stopped at a traffic light.</p>
        <p>All fiction needs drama, and many beloved children's classics -- from ''Heidi'' to ''The Secret Garden'' -- feature protagonists who overcome loneliness and grief.</p>
        <p>But in much of today's young-adult fiction, the miseries of life are not just the backdrop, but the whole point. And while the situations vary, the books sound pretty much the same, offering first-person, affectless accounts of a troubled time, with little description or artfulness. ''The envelope has been pushed and pushed and pushed,'' said Michael di Capua, a publisher of children's books at Hyperion. ''You need a bigger and bigger jolt to keep people's attention. There's a big, fat, wide streak of sensationalism in there. It's depressing.''</p>
        <p>There is no doubt such stories sell. But why they appeal to adolescents, what their effect is and what they mean about society  are more complicated questions. ''Teenagers and preteens have particular curiosity,'' said Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical Center. ''They want to know about the world, what's really going on. They're sticklers for honesty and they don't want to be shielded from reality. These kids are watching 'Jerry Springer' on television, and all kinds of violent movies, and if they see these kinds of books around, they'll want to read them.''</p>
        <p>But, he wonders along with many parents, to what effect? ''Does it contribute to the increased depression we're seeing among young people? We don't know, '' he said.</p>
        <p>Judith Rovenger, a youth services consultant at Westchester Library Systems in Ardsley, N.Y., sees the gritty reality books as a healthy, no-consequences way for adolescents to explore intense feelings.</p>
        <p>''A lot of these books are about people surviving at the extremes, and that's very interesting to adolescents,'' she said. ''Kids who haven't been through any of these horrors still know the intense feeling of being misunderstood. It's part of adolescence that every child feels abused.''</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Rovenger has her caveats. ''There's no book that's good for every kid,'' she said. ''But assuming they're choosing to read these books, I worry more that, if they're badly written, it will numb them to good literature. And if gritty books were the only thing a child was reading, I'd say lighten up a little.''</p>
        <p>For some children, books that reflect tough realities may be helpful. Mr. Myers, the author of ''Monster,'' said he saw his books as a validation for young people who do not find their situations reflected in literary classics. ''My experience, growing up poor, in Harlem, was that none of the books I saw had anything to do with my life at all, so I came to the conclusion that my life was not valuable,'' he said. ''I think young people have to have some books that they can pick up and say, this is about me.''</p>
        <p>But a too literal reflection of problems may not be useful, said Robert Coles, a child psychiatrist who teaches at Harvard. ''Children in difficult situations ask the larger questions, the kind of questions the Bible asks,'' he said. ''Why does this happen? Why am I the one? I remember a girl I was treating who had leukemia. She knew what was happening to her blood. What she was worried about was what would happen to her mother. A book about a kid with leukemia wouldn't help her. What would help her was Tolstoy. A great novelist puts the reader in subjectivity, not objectivity. This obsession with factuality has its limits and may actually deprive children of an imaginative response.''</p>
        <p>And fact-based books are not the only way to tackle tough issues. Certainly, fantasies like the Harry Potter books -- like C. S. Lewis's Narnia series or Madeleine L'Engle's ''A Wrinkle in Time'' before them -- deal with good and evil, suffering, love and betrayal, albeit within a magical setting.</p>
        <p>Ms. L'Engle recalled an Authors Guild program on children's literature in which New York City teenagers were asked to bring their favorite books -- and three out of four were fantasy. ''The kids,'' she said, ''picked up on the unspoken assumption that they were interested in reading about problems like neglect and abuse, and they said, 'No, we're living that, why would we want to read about it?' ''</p>
        <p>Compellingly Grim Fiction, Then and Now</p>
        <p>A taste of grim reading for young adults from 1898, from ''Paul and Virginia,'' by Bernardin de Saint-Pierre: ''The body was half covered with sand, and preserved the attitude in which we had seen her perish. Her features were not sensibly changed, her eyes were closed, and her countenance was still serene; but the pale purple hues of death were blended on her cheek with the blush of virgin modesty.''</p>
        <p>A sampling of more modern fare:</p>
        <p>From ''Speak,'' by Laurie Halse Anderson (Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux, 1999), about a ninth-grader who has been raped: ''It is getting harder to talk. My throat is always sore, my lips raw. When I wake up in the morning, my jaws are clenched so tight I have a headache. Sometimes my mouth relaxes around Heather, if we're alone.''</p>
        <p>From ''The Facts Speak for Themselves,'' by Brock Cole (Puffin, 2000): ''The woman policeman says why don't you come in here, and so I went. It was a little room with a table and some chairs. That was all. Instead of a window, there was a big mirror. I wouldn't look at that. I didn't want to see myself. I sat down and folded my hands. There was still blood under my nails, so after a minute I put them under the table.''</p>
        <p>From ''Smack,'' by Melvin Burgess (Avon, 1999): ''I got to admit, heroin's the best. I mean, THE BEST. The others, well . . . acid, your thoughts come alive and they start to live a life of their own. Hash, your senses sort of wake up. But with heroin, ahhh. You can just sit in a sewer all day and be sooo happy and feel sooo good.''</p>
        <p>From ''Monster,'' by Walter Dean Myers (HarperCollins Juvenile Books, 2000): ''They take away your shoes and your belt so you can't kill yourself no matter how bad it is. I guess making you live is part of the punishment.''</p>
