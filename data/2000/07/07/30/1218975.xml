        <p>Heaping lavish praise on his wife as the most intelligent and passionate person he had ever met, President Clinton exhorted a small but generous clutch of contributors in Manhattan yesterday to guard against complacency in a time of prosperity and to remember the vast differences between Republicans and Democrats.</p>
        <p>''The good-times elections are as big a test of our judgment and our values and our national character as the tough-times elections,'' he said, speaking at a luncheon fund-raiser sponsored by Korean-American organizations at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.</p>
        <p>The event collected $250,000 for Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign for the Senate. ''Remind your fellow Americans not to go to sleep in this election year, that what you do in good times is just as important, maybe more important, as what you do in bad times, in elections,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''Elections are choices with real consequences.''</p>
        <p>The president repeatedly emphasized what he called the ''huge differences'' between the two parties, singling out tax cuts, gun safety laws and hate crimes legislation as examples.</p>
        <p>And even though his remarks seemed to be less about the Senate race than about the larger contest between Republicans and Democrats, he had nothing but praise for his wife, the candidate at the center of yesterday's fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>''Of all the hundreds of people I've known, including many presidents and candidates for presidents, I have never known anyone who had the same combination of intelligence and passion and knowledge and ability to get things done for children, for families, for education, for health care as my wife does,'' he said in introducing Mrs. Clinton. ''She can do things and she knows things that no one else now in our public life can do and know, just because of the life she's lived.''</p>
        <p>What followed was an equally lavish display of admiration from Mrs. Clinton, who has tethered her campaign to the successes of the Clinton administration over the last seven years. She urged her audience to make election-year choices that would continue those successes, giving her husband credit for reducing crime, introducing health care for poor children and trimming the welfare rolls.</p>
        <p>''Our country is a better place today than in 1992 because of his leadership, and I'm very appreciative,'' she said. ''We all have a choice, to decide whether we go forward together or make a U-turn back to the past.''</p>
        <p>What effect yesterday's audience would have on her race, though, remained unclear. Organizers of the event estimated that a quarter of the contributors came from out of state, and a few of the most prominent donors said they had not yet decided whom to vote for.</p>
        <p>The fund-raiser was organized by Albert Kwak, a businessman from Iowa City who said he was approached by a friend of the president's -- a Cleveland businessman, Tony George -- to arrange a Korean-American function for Mrs. Clinton's campaign. Neither Mr. Kwak nor another organizer, Gilliam Kim, the owner of a Chicago cellular telephone company, would say how much they contributed.</p>
        <p>Campaign aides said yesterday that the gathering of about 200 people had generated roughly $250,000.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's event was Mrs. Clinton's second fund-raiser among Korean-Americans. The first, held two weeks ago at a Korean restaurant in Flushing, Queens, raised about $60,000, campaign aides said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton praised Korean-Americans for their educational achievements, noted her support for a federal hate crimes law and applauded the contributions of immigrants to New York, pointing to a recent study that concluded that 40 percent of all New York City residents today were born outside the country.</p>
        <p>''I think this is a wonderful statistic,'' she said. ''New York is really the world.''</p>
        <p>She repeated her call for affordable health care, money to equip old schools with new technology, and prescription drug benefits for the elderly on Medicare. Her remarks were notable only in that she said nothing about her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio. Last week, she urged him to engage in a series of debates and excoriated his links to a group with unorthodox views on the causes of AIDS.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, in agreeing to debate, suggested three locations. Two of them had been proposed months ago, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was considering running for the Senate seat.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mrs. Clinton's aides said she would debate him anywhere, at any time.</p>
