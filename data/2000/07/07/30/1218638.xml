        <p>Bailey Building and Loan. Bayonne Community Bank. Different places, same idea.</p>
        <p>In a city where children often attend the same grammar schools their parents did, and where parents and their grown children often live together in two-family houses, merchants had become annoyed at the impersonal service they were receiving at banks owned by the larger out-of-town institutions.</p>
        <p>The solution? They decided about a year ago to open their own place to put their money, and the result is the Bayonne Community Bank, a grass-roots venture that is being financed by longtime residents of this working-class waterfront town.</p>
        <p>''I've been in business here 27 years,'' said H. Mickley McCabe, who is chairman of the new bank. ''I'm president of the economic development corporation, I was vice president of the chamber of commerce. But now I go into a bank and they ask me for ID. If you go into a community bank, you know them and they know you.''</p>
        <p>As a result, the bank's founders worked hard to cultivate community support, beginning with an open house last November on the bank's planned site at 40th Street and Broadway, in the heart of the town's commercial district. After two subsequent informational meetings at local restaurants, a large percentage of the 250 to 300 people who attended ultimately bought shares in the bank at $10 each, said Donald Mindiak, the bank's chief executive.</p>
        <p>The bank, which is awaiting charter approval from state and federal regulators, has the $5 million initial capitalization required by the state and is hoping to have $6 million before it opens in September, Mr. Mindiak said.</p>
        <p>Long a vibrant industrial stronghold, Bayonne has in the last decade been abandoned by large employers ranging from Texaco to the Army. Moreover, 50 years ago this city of about 60,000, which sits on a three-square-mile peninsula, was cut off from its nearest neighbor, Jersey City, by the turnpike's Newark Bay extension.</p>
        <p>But about three months ago it became much more accessible with the opening of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail line, which can deliver Manhattan-bound commuters from Bayonne to the Exchange Place PATH station in as little as 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>''Bayonne is the unclaimed jewel,'' Mr. McCabe said in a recent interview.</p>
        <p>Although the city missed out on previous real estate booms in Hudson County, Mr. McCabe and his fellow investors hope Bayonne can finally attract the kinds of young professionals who flocked to Hoboken in the early 1980's in search of affordable housing, as well as families who are tired of long commutes to Manhattan from the distant suburbs.</p>
        <p>''The city of Bayonne is in a perfect position to revitalize itself through the advent of light rail,'' he said, pointing to the two most evident symbols of the city's hard times -- a 70-acre former Texaco site that needed years of environmental cleanup, and the shuttered Military Ocean Terminal, which not long ago employed 2,500 people.</p>
        <p>Newly created, or de novo, banks, are often run by people like Mr. Mindiak -- who was born and raised here but lost his job as treasurer of the First Savings Bank of New Jersey when it was bought out by Richmond County Savings, which has its headquarters on Staten Island. Indeed, about 25 such banks have opened in New Jersey in the past couple of years, said Jim Meredith, senior vice president of the New Jersey League-Community and Savings Bankers.</p>
        <p>''They are defined by their philosophy more than anything else,'' Mr. Meredith said. ''Management tends to be very involved in the community and in local civic organizations.''</p>
        <p>One recent day, Mr. Mindiak was greeted by several passers-by during the one-block walk from the bank's temporary offices at 42nd Street and Broadway to its 4,700-square-foot construction site a little more than a block away. He said the bank's neighbors were shown blueprints before the building was even begun, and they were asked to offer suggestions or concerns.</p>
        <p>''This is an extremely traditional town with traditional values,'' he said. For instance, he said research had found that in Bayonne, regular passbook savings accounts rather than high-interest-bearing CD's or money market accounts made up the highest percentage of deposits.</p>
        <p>Once the new building opens on 40th Street, it will feature off-street parking, a three-lane drive-through window and two automated teller machines -- one of them a drive-through. They hope to keep the bank open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. seven days a week, although they concede that those hours may not be feasible at first. ''People shouldn't be waiting for us to open up, we should be waiting for them to come,'' Mr. Mindiak said.</p>
        <p>His philosophy is in sharp contrast to many of today's large financial institutions. ''In New Jersey, several out-of-state banks have come in and acquired banks,'' Mr. Meredith said, ''and they are often not as responsive to the local communities and their small or mid-size businesses and local retailers.''</p>
        <p>In this instance, Mr. McCabe, who lives and works within a block of the bank, says that all of the board members and executives were born, raised or own businesses in Bayonne, which he believes distinguishes it from other area savings banks.</p>
        <p>One Bayonne resident, John Halecky, a councilman whose family owns a pharmacy  one block from the new bank, said he had recently bought shares in the bank because the board included so many familiar names.</p>
        <p>''It's all the local movers and shakers,'' said Mr. Halecky, who added that he was also attracted by the prospect of investing in his hometown. ''I think the future of Bayonne is bright.''</p>
