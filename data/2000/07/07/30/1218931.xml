        <p>Rick White began his New York baseball career yesterday with his breath short and his pitches wild. There he was, working in the eighth inning of a tie game, and White, the Mets' new setup man, had not been so nervous since he was a rookie six years ago. He walked the leadoff batter, told himself to calm down, and issued another walk with two outs.</p>
        <p>Then White, a hard-throwing right-hander, faced the St. Louis Cardinals pinch-hitter Shawon Dunston and struck him out on three fastballs, each higher in the strike zone than the last. White took in the cheers of the 50,726 fans at Shea Stadium, then returned to the dugout and sat next to Bubba Trammell, the outfielder traded with him from Tampa Bay on Friday.</p>

        <p>Rick White began his New York baseball career yesterday with his breath short and his pitches wild. There he was, working in the eighth inning of a tie game, and White, the Mets' new setup man, had not been so nervous since he was a rookie six years ago. He walked the leadoff batter, told himself to calm down, and issued another walk with two outs.</p>
        <p>Then White, a hard-throwing right-hander, faced the St. Louis Cardinals pinch-hitter Shawon Dunston and struck him out on three fastballs, each higher in the strike zone than the last. White took in the cheers of the 50,726 fans at Shea Stadium, then returned to the dugout and sat next to Bubba Trammell, the outfielder traded with him from Tampa Bay on Friday.</p>
        <p>''I was like, 'Man, nothing against Tampa, but it didn't feel nothing like that,' '' White said. ''The first guy would get on base, and everybody knew we were going to score right there. We didn't feel that way in Tampa Bay. I don't know why that was. Maybe it was just the atmosphere. This is an unbelievable feeling.''</p>
        <p>White and Trammell watched as another Mets newcomer, shortstop Mike Bordick, punched a one-out opposite-field single with two strikes to move Robin Ventura into scoring position. Two batters later, pinch-hitter Lenny Harris dropped a single to right field to score Ventura and lift the Mets to a 4-3 victory, extending their winning streak to five games. Bordick, acquired in a trade with Baltimore on Friday, also contributed a home run on the first pitch he saw as a Met, leading off the third inning.</p>
        <p>The eighth-inning rally made White the winning pitcher. Billy Taylor, the right-handed reliever the Mets added at last year's trading deadline, was the losing pitcher in his Shea Stadium debut, also in front of more than 50,000 fans. Taylor admitted then that the fans unnerved him. There should be no such problem with White, who was so energized by the crowd, he said he would like to stay awhile.</p>
        <p>''I expected it to be just like any other day at the ballpark,'' White said. ''Once I got out there, it wasn't. If it feels like this every time, I could imagine playing for another 20 years. It's an awesome feeling. It makes you feel like a little kid again.''</p>
        <p>Bordick is no kid; he is 35, and unlike the 31-year-old White, whose rights the Mets control, Bordick is a free agent after this season and offers no clues about where he wants to sign. But like White, Bordick came from an American League East team that has been a major disappointment. The Orioles draw big crowds, but the atmosphere is listless. Shea was hopping yesterday.</p>
        <p>''There was a lot of excitement and energy,'' Bordick said. ''You just feel it. There's that buzz of just wanting to win so bad, and that's exciting. It lifts everybody up. You talk about a 10th player; you could feel that type of atmosphere.''</p>
        <p>The fans gave Bordick a curtain call after his third-inning homer to left field off Andy Benes. It was Bordick's 17th home run of the year, extending a career high, and he was modest about it. ''My home runs are usually pretty close to the left-field line, and that one was down the line,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The fans did not care. The shot produced the first of several long cheers yesterday, including two in the span of three batters in the sixth inning.</p>
        <p>Jim Edmonds had given the Cardinals a 3-2 lead with a two-run homer in the fourth. That lead stood until Mike Piazza came up again. Piazza had gone eight games without a home run, matching his longest drought of the season. But he turned on a Benes pitch in the sixth, launching it toward a children's playground behind the left-field bullpen. It bounced over the bullpen's back fence and onto the top of a party tent, an estimated 455 feet away.</p>
        <p>It was a stunning offensive display, and two batters later, the crowd witnessed stunning defense. Todd Zeile crushed a ball to deep center field, sending Edmonds sprinting back. Tracking the ball all the way over his left shoulder, Edmonds reached just far enough with his glove to snare the ball, toppling to the ground as he did. The fans at Shea stood and cheered.</p>
        <p>Zeile did not notice the reaction -- ''I was too busy thinking about being on the highlights tonight,'' he said -- but he was not surprised. When somebody makes a play like that, Zeile said, he deserves the applause.</p>
        <p>The fans were happier cheering a great defensive play by their own center fielder one inning later. Dennis Cook put himself in a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the seventh by walking two and allowing a double. Ray Lankford flied to Jay Payton in center, and pitcher Rick Ankiel -- who is one of the fastest Cardinals and was pinch-running -- broke for home. Payton fired the ball to the plate, and his one-hop throw to Piazza caught Ankiel easily.</p>
        <p>''We were lucky we had a pitcher running at third,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said, explaining that a pitcher was less likely to bowl over the catcher. ''Jay made a nice throw and Mike held on.''</p>
        <p>In the eighth, after Harris singled off Mike James to score Ventura -- who walked three times in his first game off the disabled list -- the Mets held on behind Armando Benitez, who fanned Edmonds on a 97 mile-an-hour fastball for the final out and his 25th save.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS would not rule out making a ''major deal if it would improve us'' before tomorrow's 4 p.m. nonwaiver trading deadline. Milwaukee outfielder JEROMY BURNITZ, Texas reliever JOHN WETTELAND and Tampa Bay reliever ROBERTO HERNANDEZ could be possibilities. . . . ARMANDO BENITEZ has not allowed an earned run in 15 consecutive appearances. . . . Outfielder DARRYL HAMILTON (sprained left big toe) began a rehabilitation assignment yesterday with Class AAA Norfolk. . . . JAY PAYTON batted leadoff yesterday, but Manager BOBBY VALENTINE said he had several options for that spot. . . . Reliever RICK WHITE, who is bald and has a bushy goatee like that of the former Yankee DAVID WELLS, who is known as Boomer, was nicknamed Baby Boomer by outfielder DEREK BELL. . . . The last player to hit a homer in his first at-bat as a Met was TODD PRATT, who did it in 1997 off AL LEITER, then pitching for Florida.</p>
