        <p>WINDS thrashed the lush, towering sal trees, thunder rumbled over the Himalayas and the rains rushed across a broad clipped lawn where British aristocrats once thwacked a tennis ball. In the shelter of a Raj-era, colonnaded musical pavilion, a yoga teacher showed me how to twist, stretch and balance myself in the ancient poses, or asanas, of the cobra, the tree, the cow face and the dead man.</p>
        <p>We enacted this ritual of guru and disciple on the grounds of a palace built around the turn of the century by the Maharajah of Tehri Garhwal as a playground for the British viceroy. With its Victorian balustrades and Mughal archways, the palace now furnishes the public rooms for an opulent, new $50 million spa that spills across 100 acres in the foothills of the Himalayas.</p>
        <p>As the yoga session proceeded, the rains built to a lashing fury, making a curtain that enclosed the pavilion in a watery intimacy. Then they were gone as quickly as they came. While I lay back on the white marble floor, clearing my mind of thought and relaxing each body part, the only sounds were of frogs, crickets and birds.</p>
        <p>If ever there was an escape from the heat and dust, the noise and the teeming cities of India, this is surely it. Perched 3,280 feet above sea level, with majestic views of the town of Rishikesh and the mighty Ganges River about 160 miles northeast of New Delhi, Ananda in the Himalayas offers austere luxury for the sybarite, hiking, squash and rafting for the athlete and yoga, meditation and Ayurvedic massage therapies -- among many other treatments -- for the stressed out.</p>
        <p>The spa's construction was still in the final stages of completion when I was there last month -- and plenty of imperfections were yet to be sanded away. The water in the showers and the Jacuzzi bath was not hot enough. The restaurant menu was a jarring mixture of light fusion cooking and spicy Indian meats and curries. The staff was sometimes overly solicitous when all you wanted was to be left alone.</p>
        <p>Still, the Ananda's designers have managed to graft a modern, well air-conditioned, 21,000 square-foot spa and 75-room hotel, decked out with minibars, walk-in closets and cable television, onto a terrain haunted by India's ancient and colonial history.</p>
        <p>The spa sits in a region of the Himalayas that for millenniums has been a place where sadhus -- the ascetic, bearded holy men of Hinduism -- wandered the forests, meditated in caves and practiced Ayurveda and yoga.</p>
        <p>The maharajah's personal palace still stands sentinel at the entrance to the Ananda in all its decayed splendor, and the current maharajah, Manbendra Shah, retains a staff there. But he has leased the adjoining Viceregal Palace and 100 acres to a group of hoteliers and investors for at least the next 38 years.</p>
        <p>The spa was developed by a joint venture of Indian Hotels and Health Resorts on one hand and Rafael Group Hoteliers on the other. The Rafael group is an international operator of luxury hotels, but it recently merged with the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group and the Ananda is expected to become one of its properties. Mandarin Oriental runs hotels of that name in Hong Kong, Jakarta, Manila and London, as well as the Mark in Manhattan, among many others.</p>
        <p>In the viceroy's palace at the Ananda, guests will be able to play billiards on an antique pool table made in Calcutta, take yoga in a grand ballroom where the children of the British colonialists went roller-skating and -- when the hotel obtains a liquor license -- sip Cognac in an Art Deco-inspired lounge lined with autographed photographs of royals and viceroys.</p>
        <p>What struck me most when I arrived at the Ananda, however, was not the history, but the quiet and serenity, which are elusive qualities in this nation of one billion people -- and in my life, for that matter. My husband, Barry Bearak, and I are raising two young sons and covering a fifth of humanity here in South Asia as correspondents for The New York Times.</p>
        <p>When I picked up the lucky penny of this spa assignment, I wanted to find a way of getting there that gave me a head start on attaining that rarest of states: relaxation. So I chose to fly.</p>
        <p>But in this part of the world, travel is anything but predictable or easy. I boarded a 40-minute Indian Airlines flight to Dehra Dun one sultry afternoon, flies buzzing in the cabin of the 20-seat propeller plane, and buried my nose in the Ananda's brochures.</p>
        <p>I had never been to a spa before, never had a facial or a body wrap, never taken yoga. I spent the flight selecting the ways I was going to pamper myself. Would it be the Detox Papaya Body Polish? The Seaweed Hydrotherapy Bath? Or maybe Pizhichil, an Ayurvedic treatment in which two therapists pour warm oil all over your body?</p>
        <p>At one point, I looked up and saw that we had entered what appeared to be an endless cotton ball. Unconcerned, I went back to reading. When I glanced up again, I saw the pilot waving to a stewardess and felt the plane bank sharply. My shoulders squeezed a notch tenser as I realized we were turning back to Delhi. Visibility was zero because of premonsoon rains.</p>
        <p>The rest of the evening in Delhi was spent scrambling for a ticket on the train, scarce this time of year because so many pilgrims and people seeking escape from the capital's beastly heat head for the hills. But I managed to get a first-class seat on the Shatabdi Express at 7 the next morning.</p>
        <p>The station swirled with travelers. Coolies threaded through the crowds with stacks of luggage balanced on their heads. As I walked down the platform, I choked on the stench of human excrement that was heaped along the track. Toilets aboard are just stainless steel holes that empty onto the ground rushing beneath you.</p>
        <p>Once I settled into the air-conditioned first-class cabin, though, with its wide, comfortable seats, the five-hour ride was  quite pleasant. As the train gathered a  gentle, rocking momentum, I watched rain-drenched fields flash by. At the Saharanpur station, I looked across the tracks into a car without air-conditioning where a beautiful little girl, her hair shorn like a boy's, her dark eyes outlined in thick smudges of kohl, swung gaily on the bars of an open-air window.</p>
        <p>Images such as this one are the unbidden pleasures of a journey through India. I felt myself letting go of the need for a tight schedule. Travel here teaches a kind of fatalism: accept the slippage of time, or sacrifice all peace of mind.</p>
        <p>A white-suited driver from the Ananda met me at the Haridwar station with a cold face cloth. We drove through town, past jangling horse and buggies, pushcarts loaded with mangoes, ragged, bearded sadhus and hawkers selling ripe cherries in twists of newspaper. The drive to the hotel took about an hour, much of it through the Rajaji and Chilla national parks, with a final snaking ride up a mountainside to the Ananda.</p>
        <p>As a golf cart took me down a steep, densely forested incline to my room, I breathed in the cool, fresh air, scented by pine trees planted to make the British overlords feel at home. The hotel itself curved along a ridge that afforded spectacular views of Rishikesh. The town was laid out in the valley below, along the banks of the Ganges, which was the color of milky masala tea.</p>
        <p>To an American, the hotel and spa, with their red-tiled roofs and cream-colored stucco exteriors, looked Mediterranean. But Ingo R. Schweder, one of the hoteliers who conceived this project in 1997, said at the end of my stay that the design was characteristic of the Himachal region of India.</p>
        <p>My quarters -- standard in the hotel, which I visited anonymously -- included a medium-sized, uncluttered bedroom, decorated with soft, muted fabrics, hardwood floors and hand-painted tantric art. It had a wall of glass with a gorgeous view of mountains and valley. The commodious bathroom  had its own striking picture window above a big bathtub. On the balcony, the only reminder of the hurly-burly below was the occasional growl of a truck grinding up the mountainside. Yellow butterflies fluttered in the updraft like pieces of tissue paper.</p>
        <p>At lunch on a teak deck high in the treetops, I enjoyed a tangy, refreshing banana lassi -- a yogurt drink -- a salad of greens with roasted eggplant from a nearby organic farm, and a modest, zesty bowl of linguine with a roasted tomato sauce. It was the first in a series of meals that were not all as satisfying as this one.</p>
        <p>But for a hard case like me -- whose mind churned with a phantasmagoria of other things I ought to be doing -- the Ananda provided a respite, as it appeared to as well for the multigenerational Indian families who were enjoying its pleasures while I was there. It has many beautiful spots in which to sit and read, a first-rate gymnasium and separate areas for men and women that offer a sauna, Jacuzzi bath, steam room, foot bath, chilling plunge pool and relaxation room.</p>
        <p>My most memorable experiences, though, were in the hands of the Ayurvedic therapists, Vidya Mohan and Shetcy George, and the yoga instructor, Rishi Bharadwaj.</p>
        <p>Miss Mohan and Miss George, who were recruited from the southern state of Kerala, gave me an extraordinarily sensuous couple of hours one afternoon in one of the spa's 13 treatment rooms. I lay on a long wooden table made from a neem tree. For an hour, the two of them -- the Esther Williamses of massage -- kneaded me from head to toe in synchrony. The treatment is called Abhyanga. The cost is $22.50.</p>
        <p>FOR the following 45 minutes, I underwent the Pizhichil therapy (cost: $40). Miss Mohan continuously poured warm sesame oil, earthily scented with 23 herbal essences, through the spout of a brass cruet all over my body, gently rubbing it in, while Miss George reheated the oil that flowed off the table for reuse.</p>
        <p>For someone like me, who is always chiding my sons, Max, 10, and Sam, 5, to eat over their bowls of salad so they don't drip vinaigrette on their shirts, submitting to this oil bath took some getting used to. But I did it, and it was unforgettable.</p>
        <p>I came back the next day for another session with Miss Mohan and Miss George, but did not like the Shirodhara treatment at all, though they performed it beautifully. I was nearing the end of my stay, and perhaps I had had enough pampering.</p>
        <p>For half an hour, they poured a steady stream of herbal oil on my forehead. Cost: $40. This is supposed to pacify the mind and body, but I felt restless and kept wanting to leap from the table and dance when a particularly catchy Hindi movie tune came on the stereo. I also felt as if my head was turning into a mop, with my hair absorbing huge, gooshy quantities of oil.</p>
        <p>But you never know what you'll like unless you try it. Yoga, I liked. Mr. Schweder, the hotelier, found Mr. Bharadwaj, the yoga instructor, in Bombay, where he was a favorite of the city's rich socialites. This lithe young man, age 25, has big ears, a clean-cut look, a direct, understated manner and a hypnotic voice that resonates like a tuning fork when he says ''ohm.''</p>
        <p>''Rishi is very popular among the rich and famous of Bombay,'' Mr. Schweder said. ''He has a huge sensitivity to teaching different levels of yoga.''</p>
        <p>Translation: He makes out-of-shape, middle-aged people feel good.</p>
        <p>Most mornings and evenings, Rishi gave a class at the musical pavilion and all but once I was his only pupil. He calmly explained the positions, the breathing techniques and the philosophy of yoga and meditation.</p>
        <p>At the end of the hour, when I lay on my back in the dead man pose, he padded around me in his white pajama and bare feet, telling me to concentrate on the tip of my nose or my breathing. At these moments, I felt an emptiness of mind and a welcome stillness of spirit.</p>
        <p>Easy does it</p>
        <p>Basics</p>
        <p>Ananda in the Himalayas, the Palace Estate, Narendra Nagar, Tehri Garhwal, Uttar Pradesh, 249175 India. Telephone (91-13) 782-7500 or (91-11) 689-9999, fax (91-13) 782-7550.</p>
        <p>Prices for the 70 standard rooms are $225 single and $275 double per day, which includes breakfast and one spa treatment each day. The Ananda has five suites, ranging from $425 to $850. Visitors should note that listed prices for rooms, suites and spa services do not include 5 percent tax.</p>
        <p>The hotel and spa has a double-occupancy ''rejuvenation retreat'' package for a two-night stay. It costs $675 and includes daily breakfast, at least one spa treatment and a daily yoga or aerobic session for each person. Either person can take one beauty treatment.</p>
        <p>Prices for a single treatment session or massage range from about $20 to $56.</p>
        <p>Dinner for two, not including wine, costs about $40 to $45.</p>
        <p>There are monsoon rains in August, and the tourist season gets under way in September.</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>A 50-minute flight from New Delhi to Dehra Dun on Indian Airlines leaves on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Round-trip fare is $200. The flight to Dehra Dun is followed by a 45-minute taxi ride to the spa costing $18, at 44.6 rupees to the dollar. If you phone ahead, Ananda will fetch you in a spa car for $34.</p>
        <p>One can also arrange with the Ananda for a private helicopter or plane to pick you up in New Delhi and drop you off near the spa. The cost ranges from $250 to $280 each way.</p>
        <p>The train from New Delhi to the town of Haridwar takes four to five hours, followed by an hour's drive to the spa. A first-class train ticket is $22 each way.</p>
