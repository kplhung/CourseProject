        <p>OF all the things that roll down American highways, few are as strange and perfect as the Airstream, the R.V. for the Atomic Age. Produced since 1952 at a factory in Jackson Center, Ohio, the cylindrical, self-contained Airstream ''land yacht'' has become a middle-American answer to luxury on the high seas. By the 1960's, the distinctive trailers were available in a range of models, from the little bubble of the 18-foot Bambi to the 30-foot Sovereign Double, an airship for the road. At one time or another, every corner of the country, much of the world, and countless envious gawkers have been reflected in the Airstream's shining aluminum skin.</p>
        <p>The popular interest in Airstreams is such that Airstreamers, as the owners call themselves, have cooked up a term -- ''trailer tappers'' -- to describe those who buttonhole them on their travels. But what do the curious ask when they knock on the door? Does it get hot in there? What happens when it hails? Maybe they want to poke around inside to see the nautical details, the berths, the ship's galley, the marine toilet, the portholes. Do they ask who designed it? Probably not; that would be like asking who designed the Interstate.</p>
        <p>Until recently, the Airstream has led a quiet life, loved by the cult of its owners who gather by the thousands to park in radiating ''wagon wheels'' at annual rallies or who caravan in comfort to hardscrabble destinations. The caravan tradition began with the the inventor of the Airstream and the company's founder, Wally Byam, who led Airstreams on dozens of goodwill missions overseas, including a 34,000-mile trip through Asia and Europe in 1964. Following Byam's lead, Airstream owners -- weekenders, retirees and a core of ''full-timers'' -- have continued this quirky community, carrying on as a kind of folk tradition well outside the public gaze.</p>
        <p>At the most recent rally, near Bismarck, N.D., this month, 2,000 Airstreams gathered under the auspices of the Wally Byam Caravan Club International. Since the 1980's, Airstream has only produced what purists call ''squarestreams,'' blunt but still shiny approximations of the old models. At the Bismarck rally, most of the trailers were these clunkier, post-streamlined designs, but the presence of a devoted minority of classic Airstream enthusiasts, members of the rival Vintage Airstream Club, attests to the growing popularity of the older models.</p>
        <p>The splinter club formed in 1994, around the time that designers and consumers began to rush in numbers to all things mid-century. As curiosity became a full-blown design revival, Airstream's happy obscurity eroded. The revival announced itself, as so many do, in an embrace by Hollywood. On the screen, Tim Burton (owner of three vintage trailers) pitted alien flying saucers against earthling Airstreams in his 1996 comedy ''Mars Attacks!'' And on the ground, just as free-form modern homes by John Lautner are being snapped up by young stars, an Airstream in the driveway has become another kitschy status symbol: a few Eames chairs scattered around, some period Formica, a 1963 Airstream Bambi parked out back for the guests.</p>
        <p>The shelter and lifestyle magazines picked up on the trend, paving the way for Airstream chic. An issue of Flaunt included a pop-up Airstream, presumably as a kind of tiki for the road-deprived urbanite. Even Manhattan has its token Airstream, a vintage 20-footer used as a projection booth for summer movies in Bryant Park. In May, Wilsonart, the laminate company, parked a trailer at the Javits Center to show off an updated interior concept they hope to sell to Airstream Inc.</p>
        <p>Now, at last, there is a book for the armchair Airstreamer, ''Airstream: The History of the Land Yacht'' ($19.95), written by Bryan Burkhart, a graphic designer and owner of a vintage Airstream, and David Hunt, a New York-based art critic. It was published this year by Chronicle Books of San Francisco, a house known as a leader in repackaging retro styles for contemporary consumption; the book takes its place on the backlist not far from ''Patio Daddy-O: 50's Recipes With a 90's twist.''</p>
        <p>WHAT happens to a design when it goes from popular to Pop? The Airstream can survive a gloss of nostalgia, but it may not fare so well with that late, late 90's twist: seeing it as a fashion statement, an accessory, not a tool. There is something unfortunate about glamorizing this thing, which was meant to be used, to be bashed about, hitched to the family truck and towed to Lake Victoria. For Byam, function ruled; he once said of the Airstream, ''Let's not make any changes -- let's make only improvements.''</p>
        <p>That aversion to styling is what made the Airstream so good. If you parse the design, as the authors of ''Airstream'' did, you'll find Pan Am seaplanes, old Chryslers and fast trains, a hint of the Dymaxion House, maybe a touch of Roswell, certainly a big dose of the American passion for ameliorative gadgetry that achieved such unusual elegance in the functional designs of the fetishized 1950's. But, as Mr. Burkhart said recently: ''It's all accidental. There was no way Wally knew Buckminster Fuller.'' It's not fashion or its opposite, naivete: dedicated problem-solving made the Airstream that rare and wonderful and fragile thing, a genuine American design icon: purpose-built, frankly eccentric, infectiously optimistic; branded, but stubbornly anonymous.</p>
