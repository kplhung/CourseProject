        <p>Shaking his head as two workmen divided his living room, Craig Cohen was incredulous at New York's sky-high rents.

        <p>Shaking his head as two workmen divided his living room, Craig Cohen was incredulous at New York's sky-high rents. His new 1,000-square-foot apartment on 34th Street near Broadway, spacious but empty, was costing him $2,700 a month, plus a broker's fee and about $1,500 to turn the large one-bedroom into a two-bedroom.</p>
        <p>''This is the only thing you can do for privacy,'' said Mr. Cohen, a recent graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as he pointed to the new wall.</p>
        <p>Or rather, the partition. It was installed by the Wall PPS, which despite its name does not build walls. The company builds temporary partitions, removed when the lease expires. The panels are secured by aluminum rods that press against the ceiling and floor.</p>
        <p>''I thought it would be more temporary-looking,'' Mr. Cohen's roommate, Aaron Watts, said of their partition, which seems to be stereo-proof. ''I'd say it was as good as the walls that are permanent. I don't hear his music.''</p>
        <p>Scott Webb, the company's founder, was inspired by the Pink Floyd album ''The Wall'' when he started the company in 1996 in Long Island City, Queens. ''It signifies all the new people who enter the city every year and try to make their mark,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The partitions -- of Sheetrock, screws and aluminum studs -- take about four hours to install. Prices vary by size; a standard 8-foot-by-12-foot costs $826.56, which includes a $150 deposit that is returned when the partition is removed. Windows, ventilation fans and French doors can be added, ranging from $150 for one window to $625 for French doors.</p>
        <p>The company builds about 100 partitions a month, mostly on the East Side of Manhattan. Some are in offices but most of the business is residential, including the creation of extra rooms for elderly parents who move in with their children.</p>
        <p>Tandu Production, a television and film studio, blocked off an office by adding a partition in their SoHo loft headquarters. ''It's quirky, but it works,'' said Gordon McGregor, a Tandu manager.</p>
        <p>During the summer, the busy season because of the influx of college graduates trying to stretch their money, the Wall employs some 20 people. Competition is tough for the 10 or so year-round jobs. ''I'm the fastest one, only three hours at the most to make it good,'' Amir Harris, a 22-year-old installer from Queens, said as he cut Sheetrock.</p>
        <p>The Wall requires approval by the building's superintendent and landlord and offers insurance documents certifying that the partitions do no permanent damage and will be removed. ''It's as if nothing was there,'' Mr. Webb insists.</p>
        <p>And that is what New York landlords like to hear.</p>
