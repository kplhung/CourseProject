        <p>WALTER PARRS III grew up in a New York world that bore little resemblance to the one inhabited by his great-grandfather, a Russian immigrant who settled on the Lower East Side.

        <p>Until now. A few weeks ago, Mr. Parrs moved into an 11th-floor studio apartment at Avenue B and Ninth Street overlooking Tompkins Square Park, in the neighborhood his great-grandfather called home after moving here from Minsk.

        <p>WALTER PARRS III grew up in a New York world that bore little resemblance to the one inhabited by his great-grandfather, a Russian immigrant who settled on the Lower East Side. Mr. Parrs lived in an apartment on the Upper East Side, went to private schools and never ventured into the ancestral territory.</p>
        <p>Until now. A few weeks ago, Mr. Parrs moved into an 11th-floor studio apartment at Avenue B and Ninth Street overlooking Tompkins Square Park, in the neighborhood his great-grandfather called home after moving here from Minsk. Mr. Parrs has rented a small studio for $1,500 a month, signing a one-year lease with the owner of a condominium in Christadora House.</p>
        <p>The 16-story building was constructed in 1929 as a settlement house, with programs to help arriving immigrants. After various incarnations -- a welfare office, a home for the Black Panthers -- it was bought from the city in the mid-1980's by a developer who turned it into luxury condominiums.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parrs's great-grandfather probably moved to the Lower East Side because it was filled with housing he could afford; now, rechristened by some as the East Village, it is overflowing with boutiques and restaurants that attract affluent young people. Mr. Parrs's building has been the most prominent symbol of that transformation.</p>
        <p>A decade ago, during clashes between police and neighborhood residents over the eviction of squatters from the park and from city-owned buildings, protesters threw bottles at the building and screamed ''Die, yuppie scum'' at its inhabitants.</p>
        <p>Now Tompkins Square is renovated, with a dog run, a playground and a small swimming pool. Mr. Parrs said he remembers hearing stories of what the neighborhood was like in the 1950's, when his father, Walter Jr., then a child, would travel there from Queens with his family. (Mr. Parrs's father said the park was not nearly as nice then -- ''the grass was patchy, if it was there at all.'')</p>
        <p>Although the younger Mr. Parrs finds his historic connection to the Lower East Side appealing, he said his father had a greater interest in his Russian heritage, deciding in his 40's to learn the language and trace the family tree.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parrs, who graduated a year ago from the University of Virginia, is sharing the studio with Alex Bonnoit, a Frenchwoman he met when they both worked for a year in Tunisia after college. There, they had a two-bedroom apartment with two terraces for $400 a month.</p>
        <p>When he came back to New York, he began looking for apartments by using brokers, but quickly found the experience even worse than he had anticipated. ''They create a very stressful atmosphere,'' he said.</p>
        <p>SOMEONE suggested he simply knock on the doors of buildings he liked, and when he did that in Gramercy Park, he ended up taking a card from a doorman referring him to the Halstead Property Company, where he was put in touch with George Arana. Mr. Arana offered to show him something on Avenue B -- and 45 minutes later, Mr. Parrs had a place, and a little more faith in brokers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parrs and Ms. Bonnoit have furnished it simply and appealingly with tables made from barn wood, found at the flea market in Chelsea, and red and white woven floor coverings from Tunisia. ''This is what the Berber women wear on their heads for weddings,'' Mr. Parrs said.</p>
        <p>In the last few weeks, before Mr. Parrs started his job at a consulting company, they spent a lot of time exploring the neighborhood. Even when they didn't feel like going out, they were forced to by relentless construction noise.</p>
        <p>Shortly after they moved in, scaffolding went up around the building and workers began restoring the brickwork. Sometimes, plastic is put over the windows to protect them from the mess.</p>
        <p>Which is a pity, because the apartment's best feature is its expansive, unobstructed view of Manhattan. That's the feature that most attracted Mr. Parrs. ''On 87th Street we had a south-facing skyline,'' he said. ''It's just something I'm used to.''</p>
        <p>But displaying the kind of resilience shown by many who have lived in the neighborhood, he said the discovery that his apartment for one year will be surrounded by scaffolding for half that time didn't really bother him.</p>
        <p>''I don't mind the scaffolding,'' he said. ''I mind the plastic.''</p>
