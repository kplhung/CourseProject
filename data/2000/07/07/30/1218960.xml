        <p>IN ''A House Divided,'' the latest in a long line of original Showtime films produced this year, Sam Waterston plays a plantation owner who rapes a teenage slave and then rears her child as his own. The screenplay was inspired by the book ''Woman of Color, Daughter of Privilege: Amanda America Dickson, 1849-1893,'' a true story written by Kent Anderson Leslie for her Ph.D dissertation. ''Most people just don't make features out of stories like this,'' said Mr. Waterston, who is also one of the film's producers.</p>
        <p>But Showtime has come to specialize in just this sort of difficult, potentially off-putting material. Among the films that it has turned out in recent months are the life story of a pair of sibling pornographers (''Rated X''), a portrait of the Pananmanian leader Manuel Noriega (''Noriega: God's Favorite''), a three-part film that examined, among other things, the issue of gay people in the military (''Common ground'') and a drama about gulf war syndrome (''Thanks of a Grateful Nation''). At the same time the network has produced a series of original family films on serious topics, including the 1999 feature ''The Devil's Arithmetic,'' which centered on a modern girl who finds herself in a concentration camp, and ''A Storm in Summer,'' one of several 2000 films focusing on race.</p>
        <p>Stacked against some of these other projects, ''A House Divided'' is almost sedate. The film centers on Amanda Dickson, a woman of mixed race, played by Jennifer Beals, who struggles to keep her inheritance and reconcile with her mother in 19th-century Georgia. Born as one of 130 slaves on an antebellum plantation and brought up by the head of the house as if she were white, Amanda isn't told that a household servant is her mother until she reaches adulthood. She is forced to make the family secret public when her father leaves her the bulk of his estate, thereby making her by far the wealthiest African-American woman in Georgia.</p>
        <p>''On one level it's just an interesting story about a woman who goes from slavery to riches very fast,'' Mr. Waterston said. ''But the more you get into it, the more richly complicated it becomes.''</p>
        <p>Paris Qualles, the screenwriter, said he had resisted the temptation to romanticize the relationship between Amanda's mother and father, portraying the rape at the beginning of the story as a brutal and common place crime that is never forgotten by the slave Julia, played by LisaGay Hamilton. But while Julia never forgives the plantation owner, she becomes a trusted associate, handling tasks and accounts that put her in close contact with the daughter she cannot acknowledge. ''The relationship between the father and the mother fascinated me,'' Mr. Qualles said. ''I really wanted to understand this fractured union.''</p>
        <p>For My Waterston, the story is essentially a cautionary tale. ''Probably the worst things we are doing right now are things which we are only vaguely conscious of but in retrospect are stupendously obvious,'' he said. ''This is a man who got up in the morning and said to himself: 'I do good farming practices, I teach my slaves new skills, and sometimes I even give them extra money. I'm very good guy and that's it.' The rest of it he didn't talk about. I think that's true for most of us. Probably the worst things we are doing right now we are only dimly aware of.''</p>
        <p>Jerry Offsay, Showtime's programming president, said the network did movies like ''A House Divided'' to get people interested in what the network was up to ''We do well with thorny issues and shades of gray,'' he said. ''And this has plenty of both.''</p>
        <p>''A House Divided,'' along with the 31 other original films and 6 series Showtime has produced this year, is helping the network define itself in terms that are different from those of the leading premium network, HBO. While HBO has won popular acclaim for its original series. ''The Sopranos'' and ''Sex and the City,'' Showtime, Mr. Offsay said, has been aiming at specific audiences, tailoring new series around African-Americans (''Soul Food''), Hispanics (''Resurrection Blvd.'') and gay people (''Armistead Maupin's More Tales of the City'').</p>
        <p>The only concession to consistency in this diverse slate of projects is the elimination of what Mr. Offsay calls ''sexy thrillers,'' low-budget projects that Showtime once churned out at a rate of 10 a year. He says the network decided to get out of the business of quick and dirty action films in 1997. ''We were going from a Holly Hunter drama to a story for kids to a sexy thriller,'' he says. ''It stuck us as slightly schiophrenic.''</p>
        <p>Forthcoming projects include ''Bash,'' the Off Broadway drama about the nature of evil by the playwright and screenwriter Neil LaBute, on Aug. 28, and ''Queer as Folk,'' a 12-part adaptation of a British series about gay life, scheduled for early 2001.</p>
        <p>''Something like 'Queer as Folk' is not going to be for all audiences and all tastes, but for the gay audience, it's going to be must-see television,'' Mr. Offsay said. ''The same goes for 'Resurrection Blvd.' If you're Hispanic in America today and you don't have Showtime, you're going to feel like you're missing out. We're accumulating several audiences who know they can see their experiences reflected on this network.'' African-Americans represent 24 percent of its 11 million subscribers and Hispanics 12 percent, according to Showtime's subscriber statistics.</p>
        <p>The network's willingness to take risks is a boon to producers like Mr. Waterston, who says he's not sure what would have become of ''A House Divided'' if Showtime had passed. ''I think it would be great if Showtime became identified as the equivalent of the movie theater you went to when you wanted to see something really unusual,'' he said. ''The local movie theater doesn't show just one kind of movie - I don't see why a cable company should be so restricted.''</p>
