        <p>Mike Bordick had not even found the appropriate belt yesterday, but Robin Ventura had already outfitted the savior shortstop with an interesting addition to his new Mets uniform. Ventura dug up a name tag, scribbled Bordick's identity across it for any Mets who were as oblivious as Rickey Henderson and then stuck it on his chest.</p>
        <p>''Hello, my name is Mike,'' read the name tag, ''but you can call me Bordy.''</p>
        <p>It was simple, it was silly, but it was the perfect welcoming for the 35-year-old Bordick, who is the reason the Mets went from suspect to much more secure in 24 hours. If the Mets want their aspirations about October to remain serious, they needed a tested, reliable shortstop. Not Melvin Mora and not a player who would have been an improvement in experience only, like Mark Loretta.</p>
        <p>No, the Mets desperately needed Bordick, who will make every play and will make players around him better. Mora is energetic, but he is a utility player and his presence at shortstop would have eventually helped doom the Mets. Bordick was the best player on the Orioles and, after the Barry Larkin disaster, General Manager Steve Phillips responded quickly and cleverly to give the Mets a necessary boost on the field and in their minds. Bordick will provide the rest.</p>
        <p>Bordick displayed his value in major and minor ways as the Mets quieted the St. Louis Cardinals, 4-3, a day on which Bordick hammered a home run on the first pitch he saw as a Met, cued a single during a decisive rally and played shortstop like he rented office space at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>''There was so much emotion,'' a sweaty Bordick said. ''It was so exciting. For me, it was so exciting to be back in a pennant race. Every pitch matters. Every play matters.''</p>
        <p>Even after Ventura gave Bordick a name tag and Bordick listened to advice from his teammates, his stomach was gurgling. Bordick felt like he was in his first day in kindergarten, trying to fit in. He gets nervous before every game, but Bordick's nerves were more jangled yesterday. The Mets wanted him and needed him, and Bordick knows the hefty expectations.</p>
        <p>Before he batted in the third inning, there was a faint ''Let's Go, Bordick'' chant. It lasted around 10 seconds, but it would have been drowned out anyway because Bordick drilled Andy Benes's fastball for a towering home run. Hello, Bordy. Welcome to Flushing.</p>
        <p>After Bordick's fly ball caromed off the retired numbers above the left-field fence, he scooted around the bases to a standing ovation. When Bordick returned to the dugout, the fans continued howling, so the Mets nudged him out for the second curtain call of his career. Bordick sheepishly said that he was the type of player who had to be watched for a lengthy period to be appreciated, but that was false yesterday. It took one game for Bordick to have an impact.</p>
        <p>''It was incredible, certainly one of the biggest highlights of my career,'' Bordick said about his homer and the reaction. ''It was very exciting. This whole thing was exciting. Obviously, the victory was most important.''</p>
        <p>Bordick helped set up the winning run, too. With Ventura on first base and the score tied at 3-3 in the eighth, Bordick smacked a grounder that bounced seven times before hitting the lip of the infield where the dirt meets the grass and hopping over second baseman Fernando Vina's glove. It sent Ventura to third, and he eventually scored the winning run on Lenny Harris's pinch-hit single.</p>
        <p>''The homer was spectacular,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''The rest is the type of stuff you'll see often. He makes the plays without the flash.''</p>
        <p>When the Mets played the Montreal Expos last Wednesday, they started Mora at shortstop and Harris at third base in place of Ventura, who was still injured. Think about those names. Harris and Mora are best suited for coming off the bench, as Harris showed yesterday. Valentine started Bordick and Ventura yesterday, two players who allow the Mets to think about improving on what they did last season, when they reached the National League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>Phillips said Bordick and Ventura brought ''instant stability to the left side of the infield'' and, even if the general manager does not obtain a leadoff hitter or another reliever, the Mets are in a strong position. Bordick said the Mets were ''right on the edge of where they want to be'' and, though he would not admit it, Bordick can put them over that edge.</p>
        <p>''He might be the ingredient we need to get to the next level,'' Jay Payton said.</p>
        <p>Bordick smoothly and seamlessly replaced Cal Ripken at shortstop in Baltimore, a much more daunting task than diving into a pennant race.</p>
        <p>He has increased his off-season workouts and focuses on hitting to all parts of the field, which is why he has a career-best 17 homers.</p>
        <p>What Bordick learned from replacing Ripken is that the team will also dictate the success of his transition.</p>
        <p>''What helped me the most that year is the fact that we won,'' Bordick said.</p>
        <p>Bordick loved Ventura's playful approach to introducing him to the other Mets and wore the name tag as proudly as a Boy Scout wears his first merit badge. Ventura also stuck a name tag on the new reliever Rick White and was looking for Bubba Trammell, the outfielder who was also just acquired, to give him a name tag, too. The Mets have won five straight games and have renewed hopes, especially because of the new shortstop called Bordy.</p>
        <p>''I really don't believe this, to tell you the truth,'' Bordick said. ''It's incredible.''</p>
