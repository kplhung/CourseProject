        <p>With Bernstein's death in 1990, audiences lost a maestro who could be many things but never boring.

        <p>EVEN those unmoved by Leonard Bernstein's exuberant musicianship find it impossible to deny his magnetism. As conductor and pianist, Bernstein energized audiences. His exciting podium presence was the stuff of legend, and caricature. Yet his enthusiasm for music was real -- innate, even -- and not merely generated for public consumption.</p>
        <p>With Bernstein's death in 1990, audiences lost a maestro who could be many things but never boring. A decade on, no one has come close to replacing him, either on the podium or in the public imagination. So it is easy to understand why Sony Classical has opted to ring out the old millennium with a gargantuan series of midprice CD reissues titled Bernstein Century.</p>
        <p>The appellation is, of course, too grand on several counts. Although Sony's vaults (formerly Columbia's, then CBS's) contain a trove of Bernstein's best recordings, most of his early ones were made for RCA and his later ones for Deutsche Grammophon. Still, his Columbia discs represent a signal achievement. Here is America's first native-born conducting superstar at the very summit of his powers, driven but not yet mannered, ebullient but not yet self-indulgent.</p>
        <p>Bernstein recorded around 500 works for Columbia from 1950 through the 70's. His only competition in terms of output and breadth of repertory came from Herbert von Karajan, an Austrian, and Neville Marriner, an Englishman.</p>
        <p>And just as Karajan was tied to the Berlin Philharmonic and Mr. Marriner to the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, Bernstein was inextricably linked during this period with the New York Philharmonic. The orchestra's music director from 1958 through 1969, he made the vast majority of his Columbia albums with the Philharmonic, which had a relationship with the label dating from 1917.</p>
        <p>Sony says that all of Bernstein's Columbia recordings, including a few items not previously issued, will be released in this series. To date, 80 Bernstein Century CD's are available: roughly half of the conductor's Columbia output, according to the label.</p>
        <p>Not that Bernstein has ever been neglected by Sony. His recordings appear in various lines, including the large Royal Edition, with watercolors by the Prince of Wales pointlessly decorating the albums. Many of the fine 20-bit transfers from that series have been recycled for this one, which variously employs 20-  and 24-bit technology.</p>
        <p>Since much of the Royal Edition remains available, consumers with an interest in Bernstein face some confusion. Not every title in Bernstein Century was part of the earlier series, and many items in the Royal Edition are not yet available in the new format. Buyers should therefore double- check their collections before purchasing these CD's.</p>
        <p>Naturally, Bernstein Century gives pride of place to the twin pillars of the conductor's collaboration with Columbia, Mahler and American music. Bernstein brought to Mahler lasting public recognition and to American music the wider audiences sought by his mentor Serge Koussevitzky. But many of the happiest discoveries in this collection lie somewhat off the beaten path.</p>
        <p>Although Brahms was hardly unknown territory for Bernstein, the composer's scores never occupied the Olympian ground he reserved for Beethoven, there favoring speed and lean textures but also majesty. In Brahms, Bernstein confounds expectations, upending the warm approach maestros like Bruno Walter made standard. Bernstein's recordings from the early to mid-60's lack that lambency, substituting pure power instead. If precision is sacrificed in the process, passion certainly is not: Bernstein's account of the ''Academic Festival Overture'' (SMK 61846), for instance, charges ahead on more than just celebratory vim. Yet he was never interested in brute force alone, as the Andante from the Third Symphony (SMK 61829), filled with aching romance, proves.</p>
        <p>A similar melding of muscularity and ardency characterizes Bernstein's approach to Baroque music, not an area normally associated with him. In unorthodox, big-boned approaches to Bach's ''St. Matthew Passion'' and Handel's ''Messiah,'' Bernstein's abundant verve and idiosyncratic spirituality go far toward mitigating the violence he inflicts on the scores.</p>
        <p>The ''Messiah'' (SM2K 60205; two CD's), though grandly conceived and bursting with ardor, is mercilessly rearranged by Bernstein. Yet his inclusion of the countertenor Russell Oberlin among the soloists is inspired and forward-looking. The ''St. Matthew Passion'' (SM2K 60727; two CD's), rendered in English and severely cut, proves more problematic. Still, the sextet of committed soloists, including the soprano Adele Addison (also featured in ''Messiah'') and the mezzo-soprano Betty Allen, is worth hearing. And a 16-minute lecture by Bernstein, somewhat perversely tucked in as filler, offers an intelligent introduction, delivered in the conductor's inimitably accessible style.</p>
        <p>Bernstein's astonishing ability to convey the meaning of music through speech was among his main strengths. And in a series of public talks, often televised or filmed, he eloquently and plainly elucidated for countless Americans, especially the young, the power of music to enrich. Bernstein Century reveals this talent on a disc coupling Beethoven's ''Eroica'' Symphony with ''How a Great Symphony Was Written,'' a 15-minute lecture recorded in 1965 (SMK 60692). In his characteristic nasal, gravelly voice, the conductor explains Beethoven's genius and the creation of a masterwork in terms that challenge without alienating the untrained ear.</p>
        <p>Getting audiences to feel as he did about music was perhaps at the core of Bernstein's being, and one senses that generous and enthusiastic spirit particularly in performances of the bighearted 19th-  and 20th-century orchestral works that were central to his repertory. A 1959 recording of Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Scheherazade'' (SMK 60737), for example, though less supple and refined than celebrated versions by Thomas Beecham and Fritz Reiner, brims with tension and color.</p>
        <p>Similarly, a 1960 recording of Tchaikovsky's ''Capriccio Italien'' (SMK 61556), included as a fillip on a CD dominated by an indifferent account of the composer's Fourth Symphony, shows Bernstein at his grandiose best in a piece that benefits from the theatrics. And though his expansive account of Sibelius's Second Symphony (SMK 61848) will not be to all tastes, some listeners may delight in its sanguine embrace.</p>
        <p>Listeners of all stripes will be drawn to the recordings of Mahler and American music that Bernstein Century has so attractively repackaged. In these scores, the conductor's interpretive powers reached their summit, and although much has been written about his extraordinary sympathy for this repertory, the greatest tribute to his powers as a world-class Mahlerian and American-music advocate may lie less in praising these outstanding recordings than in noting what followed in their wake.</p>
        <p>Mahler was hardly unknown when Bernstein began championing his music on record in 1960. (Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Dimitri Mitropoulos and Hermann Scherchen, among others, had recorded individual symphonies well before then.) But Bernstein was the first to record all of Mahler's symphonies and a good deal of his vocal music as well. Since then, most major conductors have committed Mahler cycles to disc. If anything, we have a surfeit of Mahler records today.</p>
        <p>The situation may be less clear with regard to American music, which many insist still suffers from neglect. But if Koussevitzky cleared the path, in concert and on record, then Bernstein paved the road. Certainly, the conductors Michael Tilson Thomas, Leonard Slatkin and Gerard Schwarz, the best-known current advocates of American music, benefited from Bernstein's resoluteness.</p>
        <p>At present, Bernstein Century offers a dozen solidly packed CD's of American music, not counting the eight featuring Bernstein's own scores. For some, Bernstein's accounts of Copland, Ives, Gershwin, Barber and William Schuman are not so much benchmark recordings as holy writ, for the conductor enjoyed deep associations with these composers.</p>
        <p>Those less familiar with this music should relish two potpourri discs. In ''American Masters'' (SMK 60594), Bernstein leads three symphonies feelingly: Roy Harris's searing Third, David Diamond's glinting Fourth and Randall Thompson's propulsive Third. In ''American Masters,'' Volume 2 (SMK 61849), he indulges in the raucous pleasures of Walter Piston's ''Incredible Flutist'' and, with Orson Welles as narrator, he blunts the political cant of Marc Blitzstein's ''Airborne Symphony.''</p>
        <p>Naturally, no discussion of Bernstein is complete without mentioning his own compositions, works that place the conductor in a singular category. Like his hero Mahler, Bernstein excelled at both conducting and composing, but Mahler, who died in 1911, left no real recorded legacy. Yes, other esteemed conductors also composed, but how many music lovers today clamor for the symphonies of Wilhelm Furtwangler or Jean Martinon?</p>
        <p>For all the prejudicial comments leveled at Bernstein's concert works -- derivative, slight, turgid -- no one disputes the seriousness with which he approached their composition. That he left recordings of his own works only enhances our appreciation of them, for who better than this gifted maestro to interpret the work of a major American composer, especially if the composer is himself?</p>
        <p>Unlike the conductors who were famous in life but left only faint footprints, Bernstein seems assured of his place in the collective memory. And with this series, Sony has finally done an indisputably great artist proud. Like the man himself, Bernstein Century is grandly ambitious, abundantly intelligent and often intensely moving.</p>
        <p>Special Delights of a Conductor's Recorded Legacy</p>
        <p>Here is a small sampling of enticing items now available in Sony Classical's Bernstein Century series, with Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic unless otherwise indicated. Some discs include additional titles.</p>
        <p>* Barber: Adagio for Strings, Violin Concerto (SMK 63088). A dry-eyed but emotive account of the Adagio precedes a still-unsurpassed performance of the Violin Concerto, with the violinist Isaac Stern at his searching best.</p>
        <p>* Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 4 and 5 (SMK 63079). Bernstein approached Beethoven with passionate conviction. Here, eloquent phrasing, lithe textures and a sense of inevitability result in model performances.</p>
        <p>* Berlioz: ''Harold in Italy,''  ''La Mort de Cleopatre'' (SMK 60696). Typical Bernstein vigor colors two of Berlioz's finest works. William Lincer, the principal violist of the New York Philharmonic, proves an estimable soloist in ''Harold,'' and the mezzo-soprano Jennie Tourel touchingly limns a range of emotions as the Queen of the Nile.</p>
        <p>* Bernstein: ''I Hate Music,''  ''La Bonne Cuisine'' (SMK 60697). These whimsical song cycles occupy just a small portion of this CD but are its real reward. Previously unissued, the recordings feature Tourel at her most charming, with Bernstein at the piano.</p>
        <p>* ''Bernstein on Jazz'' (SMK 60566). Two Bernstein jazz lectures are paired with crossover works featuring Louis Armstrong and the Dave Brubeck Quartet.</p>
        <p>* Bernstein: Theater Music (SMK 63085). Even Bernstein's most vociferous detractors make allowances for his ''popular'' scores, ''Candide,''  ''West Side Story,''  ''On the Waterfront'' and ''Fancy Free.'' Here are excerpts from those works played with unparalleled zest.</p>
        <p>* Copland: Ballets (SMK 63082). Even the composer couldn't make his three most famous ballets -- ''Appalachian Spring,'' ''Rodeo'' and ''Billy the Kid'' -- dance the way Bernstein does. A rousing ''Fanfare for the Common Man'' is a nice bonus.</p>
        <p>* Gershwin: ''Rhapsody in Blue'' (SMK 63086). This is the one indispensable recording of this familiar work, with Bernstein both conducting and playing the piano, paired with an equally fine ''American in Paris.''</p>
        <p>* Ives: Symphonies Nos. 2 and 3 (SMK 60202). Bernstein revels in this music's eclecticism and brilliant cacophony in classic performances.</p>
        <p>* Mahler: Songs (SMK 61847). This 1968 recording has Bernstein at the piano, vividly accompanying the baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in especially forceful readings.</p>
        <p>* Mahler: Symphony No. 9 (SMK 60597). An aching and apocalyptic version of this signature vehicle for Bernstein; the recording remains a touchstone.</p>
        <p>* ''Modern Masters'' (SMK 60725). Recorded in the mid-50's with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, Bernstein's performance of Harold Shapero's Symphony for Classical Orchestra still sounds fresh. Ditto the account of Luigi Dallapiccola's fetching and ingenious ''Tartiniana'' for violin and orchestra, with Ruth Posselt as soloist.</p>
        <p>* Schubert: Symphony No. 8 (SMK 61842). Among the glories of Bernstein's Columbia catalog, this atmospheric and propulsive reading of Schubert's ''Unfinished'' shows the New York Philharmonic in peak form.</p>
        <p>* Shostakovich: Symphonies Nos. 5 and 9 (SMK 61841). Bernstein's combustible Fifth, from 1959, deserves its legendary status; it is paired with an excellent version of the composer's pithy Ninth.</p>
