        <p>WELDED!'' at the Neuberger Museum of Art here is the curator Judy Collischan's ''dream exhibition.''</p>
        <p>She had been thinking about a survey of welded sculpture since the early 1970's when a sculptor in Omaha, Sidney Buchanan, reminded her that a survey of welded sculpture had never been done. What was attractive about the subject, Ms. Collischan said, is that its history is so short, about 70 years, so it can be managed. She obtained 97 works, both historical and quite recent, which fit into the museum's two largest galleries and spill over to the outdoors.</p>

        <p>WELDED!'' at the Neuberger Museum of Art here is the curator Judy Collischan's ''dream exhibition.''</p>
        <p>She had been thinking about a survey of welded sculpture since the early 1970's when a sculptor in Omaha, Sidney Buchanan, reminded her that a survey of welded sculpture had never been done. What was attractive about the subject, Ms. Collischan said, is that its history is so short, about 70 years, so it can be managed. She obtained 97 works, both historical and quite recent, which fit into the museum's two largest galleries and spill over to the outdoors.</p>
        <p>Jokingly, she said that her real dream exhibition would necessitate tearing down the Sistine ceiling, but in its own way ''Welded!'' is quite grand. Welding, of course, means fusing metal by means of heat, but as a glossary of terms in the show's indispensable catalog reveals, many variations and nuances have been used and perfected over the years. One of the pleasures of the immense variety that is laid out is noticing how artists adapt the concept of welding to their own needs.</p>
        <p>The earliest pieces are small, but that is no indication of their importance. Julio Gonzalez is almost universally credited with making the first welded sculptures. The Oscar-size silver figure here is characterized by the kind of delicacy a dentist or jeweler might possess. Picasso took the ball and ran with it, although that isn't made clear here because his two whimsical works date from the early 1960's. Ms. Collischan said that Picasso was a better sculptor than he was a painter: Cubist theory hemmed him in, but in sculpture he could exercise all his inventiveness.</p>
        <p>American artists grabbed the ball from the Europeans. Welded sculpture is in the American grain, for it implies industrial power. David Smith is the American who popularized welding, and he is represented by ''a figure, a landscape and a still life.'' Ms. Collischan is intrigued by Smith's following the traditional categories of art in his pioneering work. The landscape piece ''Steel Drawing I'' is an almost flat steel square with a pathway cut through it, but the figure is a ''Billiard Player'' identifiable by his cue stock. Smith became known for his balancing acts of stainless steel cubes; it's bracing to find a latter-day version of this in Jedd Novatt's ''VI,'' resembling a jittery house of cards. For all the macho connotations of welding, a lot of humor and lightness can be found in the exhibition.</p>
        <p>Plenty of serious formal work is here, too, but it usually has a human side. A circle made in 1996 by Tony Rosenthal has the captivating title ''Vivaldi,'' probably for its harmoniousness. In 1959 Mr. Rosenthal made a work equally portentous, a brass ''Sun Ikon.''. Another welcome musical title is ''Round Midnight'' by Clement Meadmore. It's a small work of thick but ribbon-like bronze. The artist is known for his large-scale pieces in public spaces. In the large works lengths of metal display a bit of waywardness by a twist or two, but this modest piece is more approachable.</p>
        <p>Ms. Collischan said that in the case of many artists she couldn't get the exact work she wanted but acknowledged that because the show is stocked with a lot of unfamiliar work it commands attention. But in crucial places she has borrowed clinching examples. These include John Chamberlain's crushed car parts, which are a counterpart to Abstract Expressionism, and works by Herbert Ferber and Seymour Lipton, made up of biomorphic forms, which parallel the organic shapes of many Abstract Expressionist painters.</p>
        <p>The oddest, most unexpected work in the show is perhaps Jonathan Kirk's ''Burning Chamber,'' resembling a life-size industrial apparatus in which fire, the indispensable element in welding, becomes the subject of the work. A model for this piece is included, which reinforces the industrial underpinnings of the exhibition. Especially in the Minimalist period, beginning in the 1960's, works could become so related to industrial or factory-like production that the artist's hand never touched it. He left the fabrication to others.</p>
        <p>Even though welding might seem to be a masculine pursuit, a number of women have made especially alluring works. With well-known artists like Nancy Graves, Louise Nevelson, Grace Knowlton, Deborah Butterfield and Lila Katzen present, this shouldn't be surprising.</p>
        <p>One of the most galvanizing is Claire Falkenstein's ''Vibration'' from 1964, a large and busy tangle of copper. Later, in 1990, Judy Pfaff used reams of copper wire along with bedsprings as the basis of ''Stray Into Gold,'' an effervescent Rumpelstiltskin allusion.</p>
        <p>The show spills out of the galleries, and some pieces are appropriately outdoors. One is ''Ziplock Turtle''' by Christy Rupp. It's a rusted linear shape resembling a catcher's mask, but when a plastic storage bag is inserted and filled with water, a hearty terrapin shell shape is formed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Collischan didn't forget the person who sparked the show. Sidney Buchanan is represented by ''Frazzel I,'' in which found scrap metal objects are incorporated with steel to make, like Ms. Falkenstein's, a nervous piece. It looks like a motor either about to rev up or conk out, but the energetic ''Welded!'' itself has no doubts about its relevance.</p>
        <p>''Welded!'' is at the Neuberger Museum of Art through Aug. 27. The number to call for information is (914) 251-6100.</p>
