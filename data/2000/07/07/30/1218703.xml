        <p>Getting Waves of Attention</p>
        <p>For Rosalind Schneider, recognition is sweet but strange after 30 years on the fringe.</p>
        <p>An artist who has worked in painting, sculpture, film and video, Ms. Schneider, of Irvington, has experienced a burst of attention lately.</p>
        <p>Her recent installation, ''Wave Transformations,'' featuring digitally manipulated video images of water projected onto an oversize balloon, was first displayed in the New York Hall of Science in Queens and was then included in the Westchester Biennial 2000 exhibition at the College of New Rochelle, where it won a director's prize.</p>
        <p>The Whitney Museum in Manhattan then selected several of Ms. Schneider's early films for a festival devoted to avant-garde female filmmakers.</p>
        <p>''I knew people knew about my work, but there's always the feeling of working in a vacuum, of thinking you're doing it for yourself and not for an audience,'' Ms. Schneider said. ''When things happen at such a rapid pace, it's incredible.''</p>
        <p>She describes her efforts since the 1960's as ''a continuing saga of searching for places that reveal a real power of nature, and using that as a way of looking at the Earth.'' Her next destination is the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, where she plans to film tidal movements.</p>
        <p>What an Artist Is</p>
        <p>The city of Peekskill has redefined the word ''artist'' as part of its zoning code:</p>
        <p>''Artist: An individual who practices one of the fine design, graphic, musical, literary, computer or performing arts; or an individual whose profession relies on the application of the above-mentioned skills to produce a creative product; i.e. an architect, craftsperson, photographer, etc.''</p>
        <p>The previous definition failed to account for some applicants for Peekskill's 28 new artists' lofts and was therefore deemed outmoded, said Blanche Alter, a city planning  official.</p>
        <p>''We've had a demand from people who are not artists in the traditional sense, like furniture designers and graphic designers,'' Ms. Alter said. ''We wanted to be more inclusive to let them in.''</p>
        <p>The city expects to complete the lofts next June. Requirements call for a minimum of 51 percent of each loft to be set aside as a working studio, with the rest to be used as living space.</p>
        <p>The city is hoping the promise of affordable home ownership will entice an increasing number of artists to settle downtown.</p>
        <p>Young Conductor's Guest Stint</p>
        <p>Twenty is the magic number for the New York Philharmonic this summer. This year is the 20th anniversary of the orchestra's free outdoor summer concerts in Westchester, and, coincidentally, this year's guest conductor is 20 years old.</p>
        <p>Mikko Franck of Finland will make his debut with the Philharmonic when he leads the orchestra at Westchester Community College in Valhalla on Aug. 5 at 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>With Kurt Masur away, up-and-coming conductors get a chance to shine. Mr. Franck is no neophyte, however, having already conducted orchestras in Scandinavia and elsewhere in Europe.</p>
        <p>He made his American debut at the Aspen Festival two years ago. He will lead the Philharmonic in music by Bernstein, Gershwin, Alexander Arutunian and Stravinksy.</p>
        <p>The college, which permits picnicking, has drawn increasingly large crowds to its version of Tanglewood.</p>
        <p>In case of rain, the event moves to the Westchester County Center in White Plains. For more information, the number to call is (914) 242-6300.</p>
