        <p>When Joe Nemecek, owner of Adolf Kusy Meats on Washington Street, got to work on the morning of July 10, he heard a terrifying sound: the quiet drip-drip of ice melting.</p>
        <p>During the weekend, a pipe had ruptured in the century-old refrigeration system that keeps the meat cold in the enormous freezers and coolers of Mr. Nemecek's business, and of other wholesalers and butchers in the meat market district. He and the others spent that morning carrying in blocks of dry ice to keep their freezers cold, or scrambling to find space for their stock in other warehouses before it began to rot.</p>
        <p>''We have trouble every summer,'' said Mr. Nemecek, who had to throw away $10,000 worth of spoiled food. But he said he thought the Gansevoort Refrigeration Cooperative, which eight owners in the district formed in 1980 to run the refrigeration system, would fix it, as it had before.</p>
        <p>Instead, co-op officials decided to shut the system down except for pipes serving one block-sized building known as the Gansevoort Market. And they told the other businesses that they were on their own.</p>
        <p>Frank D. Platt, a lawyer for the co-op, said the pipes serving Gansevoort Market were above ground and so were easier and less expensive to fix than the pipes serving the other businesses, including Mr. Nemecek's, which are underground. ''The economics just weren't there,'' he said, to fix the underground part of the system.</p>
        <p>The pipes stretch from Jane Street in the West Village to West 15th Street, and from the West Side Highway to Hudson Street, an area once brimming with meat packers. But as meat businesses moved to cheaper space in the other boroughs, the outlying pipes were gradually turned off, or not repaired. Some remaining companies bought their own systems. Fewer companies using the pipes meant less money for maintenance, furthering decline. By this summer, only about a dozen companies on Washington Street and those in the Gansevoort Market were using the system.</p>
        <p>A district manager from the United States Department of Agriculture said that food safety was never compromised during the recent breakdown.</p>
        <p>Marty Heller of Endicott Meat and Poultry on Washington Street was already planning to move his business to Hunts Point in the Bronx. But he said the breakdown cost him thousands, and he called the co-op's decision not to fix the pipes insensitive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nemecek, who lost his lease in April when his building was sold to a real estate developer, said the breakdown ''really put an extra nail in the coffin'' for him, and for many of the other firms that have been struggling to keep up with rising rents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Platt said that the market would be a different place in five years. ''It's gotten to the point that the value of the real estate has overridden the value of having a meat market,'' he said.</p>

        <p>A Rich History Lurks Behind the Sides of Beef</p>
        <p>The meat market district is roughly defined by Hudson and Washington Streets east to west, and 14th and Horatio Streets north to south. It was originally the site of Fort Gansevoort, built during the War of 1812, and named for Peter Gansevoort, a Revolutionary War general. In the early 1880's, a farmers' market opened in the area; by 1888, meat wholesalers had moved in.</p>
        <p>As recently as 1986, the district had more than 120 meat firms. But today fewer than half remain.</p>
        <p>With increasing real estate development in the West Village have come efforts to landmark the area, because of some significant events in United States history and cultural affairs. On July 11, 1804, after a duel with Aaron Burr in Weehawken, N.J., a mortally wounded Alexander Hamilton was ferried across the Hudson River to the Bayard Estate (near present-day Jane Street, one block south of the market area), where he died.</p>
        <p>The De Lamater Iron Works, between 12th and 14th Streets on the river, built the boilers and engine for the Civil War ironclad ship Monitor, which defeated the Confederate Merrimac at Hampton Roads, Va., in 1862, after nearly sinking on the way.</p>
        <p>From 1866 to 1885, Herman Melville, a grandson of General Gansevoort, commuted from his home in Chelsea to the Department of Docks building at the foot of Gansevoort Street, where he worked as a customs inspector. It was the writer's first steady paycheck.</p>
