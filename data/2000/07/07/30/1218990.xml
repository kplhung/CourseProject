        <p>For the second day in a row, the trainer Bill Mott won the main event at Saratoga, sending out the lightly raced filly Dream Supreme for a come-from-behind victory in the Grade I Test yesterday. Call it a nice gift to himself -- Mott turned 47 yesterday.</p>
        <p>It was the first stakes victory for Dream Supreme, a 3-year-old daughter of Seeking the Gold, and came against a field of 11. She is owned by George Steinbrenner and earned $150,000 of the $250,000 purse for his Kinsman Stable while providing a $16.80 payoff for a $2 bet to win.</p>

        <p>For the second day in a row, the trainer Bill Mott won the main event at Saratoga, sending out the lightly raced filly Dream Supreme for a come-from-behind victory in the Grade I Test yesterday. Call it a nice gift to himself -- Mott turned 47 yesterday.</p>
        <p>It was the first stakes victory for Dream Supreme, a 3-year-old daughter of Seeking the Gold, and came against a field of 11. She is owned by George Steinbrenner and earned $150,000 of the $250,000 purse for his Kinsman Stable while providing a $16.80 payoff for a $2 bet to win.</p>
        <p>Early in the seven-furlong sprint, Dream Supreme dawdled in ninth place after a poor start behind a stellar field of rivals, which included the Grade I winners Chilukki and Finder's Fee. But the jockey Pat Day kicked Dream Supreme in gear at the top of the turn and then threaded her inside toward the rail to pass six horses, including the 28-1 shot Big Bambu, in the deep stretch.</p>
        <p>Mott, who won the Bernard Baruch on Friday with Hap, said it was a calculated risk to enter Dream Supreme in the Test in just her sixth career race. ''But by the time we got here, I thought she had enough racing to win it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The favored Chilukki never recovered from a poor start and finished a distant sixth, while Finder's Fee launched a ground-gobbling run in the stretch from 10th but could never reach Dream Supreme or Big Bambu.</p>
