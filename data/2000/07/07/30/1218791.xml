        <p>A landlord adding five stories and a penthouse to his Upper West Side apartment building has started bricking up 48 windows on the six existing floors, leaving some tenants frantic about losing light and air. Other tenants are willing to trade windows for renovations and new appliances, but a Buildings Department spokesman said that nothing justified bricking up windows and that the department was investigating.</p>
        <p>''It is absolutely illegal for him to brick up windows under any circumstances,'' said Paul Wein, a department spokesman. ''They have to be open. Even if he applied for a permit, it should have been disapproved.''</p>
        <p>But Adam Katz, the owner of the building, 203 West 90th Street at Amsterdam Avenue, said he had a permit to create 40 luxury apartments on top of his six-story, 46-unit building. To support the weight of the addition and avoid having to redo the apartments below, he is creating a concrete wall that will rise from the inner courtyard like a space needle. The foot-thick shaft will sit inches from the window panes, which is why those windows are being bricked up.</p>
        <p>The idea of low-rise buildings piggybacking extra floors is a popular if volatile one  these days, especially on the Upper West Side, where the prospect of new three-bedroom apartments is appealing.</p>
        <p>It is less appealing at 203 West 90th Street. Those facing the courtyard were told last week that they would each be losing up to five windows in their bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and in a few cases, servants' bedrooms. One apartment has already lost them.</p>
        <p>Many, like Andrea Mercado, are fuming.</p>
        <p>''My apartment is already dark,'' said Ms. Mercado, who is losing four windows. ''This will make it a dungeon. For me, it's not an issue of vents or rent reductions. It's an issue of light and air.''</p>
        <p>Another tenant, who feared retaliation if her name was given, said: ''We're miserable. We don't want to lose our windows. How will we breathe?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Katz said he was trying to soothe his tenants' fears. His menu of ''compensatory measures'' includes installing artificial lighting and ventilation systems and buying tenants new refrigerators, stoves and air-conditioners. Little light and no air will be lost, he said.</p>
        <p>''I have bent over backward three ways to Sunday to address their concerns and get everything done,'' Mr. Katz said. ''I'm perfectly willing to give them what they want.''</p>
        <p>A few tenants are willing to compromise. Carlotta Kip is losing four windows, but she said Mr. Katz had agreed to install French doors between her kitchen and dining room, thus spreading the light. ''It's one of those situations where you can think creatively,'' Ms. Kip said.</p>
