        <p>HEYMAN-Sander. Deceased July 3, 2000. Survived by daughters Susan Bell of Manhattan Beach, CA, Nancy Ostlund of Tucson, Arizona and sister Rosalie Heyman of White Plains, NY. Born January 26, 1908 in Brooklyn, NY. Educated at City College of NY and Brooklyn Law School. Acted four years in NY theatre and movies. Wrote sketches for Broadway plays as well as gags for radio and comedians. His long career in advertising began as a copywriter with BBD&amp;O. Fourteen years with The NY American and Herald Tribune Newspapers doing advertising and editorial work. His career for over 20 years with Schenley Distillers included serving as sales and marketing management, public relations, advertising director and vice president. Sander spent 26 productive retirement years serving as a consultant to Rhinebeck Savings Bank, as an advisor to the Astor Home, and as a devoted, motivated volunteer engaged in fundraising, advertising and marketing for Northern Dutchess Hospital. There his friends and colleagues established The Sander Heyman Fund in Support of Volunteerism so as to honor him for his years as a dedicated volunteer. He spent the last five years of his life in Tucson, Az in order to be close to his daughters, where he attended The Lions Club and edited his residential home newsletter. He continued to maintain his independence, quick wit, creativity and positive attitude to the end. Few men have given so generously of their time to their work, their family, their community and their friends as did Sander all his life. During his lifetime he helped many friends and colleagues with their problems, showing concern, encouragement and generosity. He was loved by all and will be greatly missed.</p>
