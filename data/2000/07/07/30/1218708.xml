        <p>When Marian Rubin picked up her photographs at Moto-Photo here last February and found the police waiting for her, she had no idea that she was under suspicion of being a child pornographer for taking nude pictures of her two granddaughters, ages 3 and 8.</p>
        <p>''I was stunned,'' Mrs. Rubin said last week. ''I just sat there saying, 'This isn't real.' I love these little girls more than anything else in the whole world.''</p>
        <p>Last Tuesday, the 65-year-old grandmother agreed to be placed in a pretrial intervention program, which calls for a year of probation, said Charlotte Smith, an executive assistant Essex County prosecutor. Mrs. Rubin said that officials still have two computers that were confiscated the night of her arrest, and that under the terms of the agreement, the prosecutor has until Jan. 19, 2001, to finish examining them.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Rubin, who had worked for 32 years as a social worker in the Belleville Public Schools, was suspended from her job with pay after her arrest. It is not clear whether she will be allowed to return.</p>
        <p>For the first time since the charges were filed, Mrs. Rubin sat in her apartment here last week and spoke out about her ordeal. She expressed rage, wonder, humor, sadness and disappointment. She said that she had been working on several essays about the case, and that she had started a legal defense fund to help defray her $25,000 in legal fees.</p>
        <p>Asked to describe the photographs, she said: ''They're dancing around the bedroom and I'm shooting. They are totally unabashed, un-self-concious kids.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Rubin, who has nude photos in her apartment -- including one of her pregnant daughter-in-law -- took a nude photography class with the artist Lucien Clergue in 1983.</p>
        <p>''Yes, the kids were nude,'' she said. ''I didn't have sexual intent. It never entered my mind that I shouldn't take these pictures.''</p>
        <p>But the police chief, Thomas Russo, said: ''The photos that I viewed I wouldn't classify as pornographic. I thought they were provocative. I wouldn't pose my grandchildren like that.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Rubin said her son and daughter-in-law never wavered in their support, and continued to send their daughters to stay with her.</p>
        <p>For now, Mrs. Rubin is ambivalent  about the case. ''People in the legal profession think this is a wonderful, wonderful outcome,'' she said. While the agreement was reached without an indictment, guilty plea or trial, she would have preferred to have been exonerated. And she is angry about what it has cost her financially and emotionally. ''I'm going to be paying for this,'' she lamented, ''for the rest of my life.''</p>
