        <p>WHEN I arrived in Amsterdam early in May, the streets were almost deserted and the shops were closed because it was a national holiday, commemorating the anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands from the German army 55 years earlier. The first person I saw as I left the hotel and turned onto the Nieuwe Doelenstrasse was a golfer carrying his clubs. I thought this augured well for my trip, since its unlikely purpose was to play golf, while all those around me were happily engaged in the more expected pursuits of museum visits, canal tours and bike trips through the tulip fields.</p>
        <p>The Netherlands is not known for golf, and has not been since the 17th century, when an early form of the game called kolfspel, which was played with a wooden club, or kolf, flourished on the frozen canals. The Dutch even claim to have invented golf, which is hotly disputed by the Scots. While the Dutch may have been first, the Netherlands has relatively few courses and the terrain in most places is famously flat.</p>
        <p>There are, though, a handful of world-class courses, which proved ideal for my weeklong golfing vacation. As it turned out, I could hardly have asked for more since the remarkably uncrowded private courses welcome visitors on weekdays (weekends are another story), and during the entire week it was a balmy 80 degrees. The owner of one of the antiques stores in the Spiegel kwartier, across from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, where I found a blue and white tile from 1700 showing two men with round brimmed hats and breeches playing kolfspel, told me that there had not been a week of such weather in the Netherlands in a hundred years.</p>
        <p>There are three superb courses along the North Sea coast in the 25-mile stretch between Zandvoort in the north and The Hague to the south -- Kennemer Golf and Country Club, Noordwijkse Golf Club and the Royal Hague Golf Club. These courses are anything but flat, as they toss and tumble incessantly over the dunes in a landscape very similar to that of the great courses of Scotland and Ireland. They also share the distinction of having been designed by the two leading English golf course architects of the last century, the legendary Harry Colt and his postwar successor, Frank Pennink.</p>
        <p>Kennemer, the most famous course in the Netherlands, is on the outskirts of Zandvoort, which is the busiest and closest beach resort to Amsterdam. Zandvoort itself is pretty tacky, in a cheerful way, with crowded tented pavilions along the beach. Behind the beach, there are stalls on the paved boardwalk selling seafood with a heavy emphasis on herring, as well as parlors that sell pancakes and poffertjes (fritters).</p>
        <p>The nearby golf course is a world apart, and its appeal is instantly recognizable. The clubhouse, built in 1912, has an enormous, symmetrical thatched roof with tiny dormer windows. Inside, there is an anonymous portrait of a boy and a girl painted around 1635 in which the little boy holds what is unmistakably a golf club.</p>
        <p>From the clubhouse, the fairways of the three nine-hole courses uncoil in all directions. The caddiemaster, with whom one must arrange a tee time, sits in the second story of a brick tower with a thatched dome, the better to survey his domain. Colt designed the original 18 holes in 1927, the B and C nines. A third nine, the A course, was designed more recently by Pennink.</p>
        <p>I arrived at Kennemer around noon on Sunday after a hearty breakfast of fried mussels and onions with three sauces on the beach in Zandvoort. While I had arranged to play during the week, I was hoping the caddiemaster would let me play that afternoon, although the course is normally closed to visitors on weekends. After a suitable period of supplication, he told me I could come back at 4 o'clock.</p>
        <p>This left time for a visit to the Keukenhof, the botanical gardens sponsored by the Dutch flower growers. The Keukenhof is in the bulb fields that spread down the coast from Haarlem to Leiden, near the pretty little villages of Bennebroek, Hillegom and Lisse. From 1401 to 1436, the grounds belonged to Countess Jacoba of Bavaria, who had a vegetable garden there for her kitchen. Hence the name Keukenhof, or kitchen garden.</p>
        <p>The spring exhibition runs from late March through late May and consists of thousands upon thousands of parterres of tulips bordered by hyacinths and daffodils, each one a carefully choreographed fusillade of yellows, reds, purples and pinks. The tulips are laid out along lanes of beech, flowering almond trees and horse chestnuts, and cascade around ponds and sculpture gardens. There are glass pavilions with different flower exhibits and shops that sell the bulbs for shipment abroad.</p>
        <p>When I returned to Kennemer, I began with the A course, the newest of the three nines, built in 1985. It's a bit quirkier and narrower than the original 18, and considered more difficult, but it is just as memorable. The best hole was the par 5 seventh, whose rippling fairway turns to the right and climbs to a raised green with a view of the church steeple and old brick water tower of Zandvoort in the distance. The only sounds came from the songbirds and the rattling of the trains that run from Amsterdam to Zandvoort.</p>
        <p>The old course designed by Colt is seaside golf at its best, with nestling greens set in little dells among the dunes, spacious, rumpled fairways and springy turf. I asked a member about the bushes that lurk off the fairways and she showed me jeneverbest, the juniper bush that produces strong Dutch gin; kardinaalsmuts, named for its red berries shaped like a cardinal's hat, and the white flowering madoorn bushes. There are no weak holes at Kennemer, but the single most fearsome hole is the 10th, a blind drive over a dune with only a red-and-white striped pole to guide you.</p>
        <p>Noordwijk aan Zee lies on the edge of the surrounding tulip fields with their striated bands of brilliant color. A more sedate and unspoiled beach resort than Zandvoort, its hotels are set back from the grassy dune that leads to the broad sandy beach.</p>
        <p>Although golf in Noordwijk aan Zee began in 1915, the present course, designed by Pennink, was laid out in 1972 near the tiny village of Noordwijkerhout. The Noordwijkse Golf Club has a distinctly different flavor from Kennemer's, notwithstanding their proximity. Kennemer is set back from the sea, but Noordwijkse lies exposed, just behind the barrier dunes that shield against the North Sea. You never actually see the sea, but you can hear the waves the whole way around. The black and white clubhouse, perched on a bluff above the course, looks like a slightly ramshackle ocean liner.</p>
        <p>The day I played Noordwijkse it was bright and calm, so the course was at its most docile. After a few holes, I paired up with with Edith, a good golfer who has been a member of Noordwijkse for 25 years. The first three holes are out in the open and then the course disappears into a forest of pines, to re-emerge only on the eighth. There is a rousing stretch of unabashed seaside golf from No. 13 all the way to the finish, with semiblind drives to fairways full of humps and hollows that zigzag through the dunes.</p>
        <p>The Hague Golf Club, or Haagsche, is the third of the sparkling seaside courses and is the oldest club in the Netherlands, founded in 1893. The original course, however, was badly damaged by the German army in World War II and a new course was built in the very swanky, wooded suburb of Wassenaar.</p>
        <p>Happily, the course is down the street from the Auberge de Kieviet, which Edith recommended and where I stopped for a delicious lunch -- a salad of smoked lamb with apricots, grilled tuna with spinach and chocolate raspberry mousse cake.</p>
        <p>The Hague course also bears the stamp of Harry Colt, but is distinct in its design, with billowing, roller coaster fairways. On some holes, I could barely see the green even on short pitch shots.</p>
        <p>While the Hague course has a coastal flavor, it's more overgrown and enclosed than Kennemer or Noordwijkse, with bushes and flowering trees that can easily snatch your ball. To compound the difficulty, the rough is deep and lush. Most of all, the course is a study in assembled shades of green, from pale pastel to the yellowy green river birch to the dark green firs.</p>
        <p>I started out at the Hague with four straight pars and a bogey, but my score soared when I reached the par 4 sixth. This is the toughest hole, requiring a blind drive over the corner of an uncharacteristically bare and menacing sand dune. The final hole is a showstopper, a par 5 from a ski slope tee that plunges to a long flat, funneling fairway. The hole finishes below the thatched clubhouse with its red and white shutters, where the members sit outside on a grass patio under white umbrellas.</p>
        <p>The next day, I headed inland to Utrecht, but not before visiting the Mauritshuis, the art museum in The Hague. I had hoped to see Vermeer's  ''Girl With a Pearl Earring,'' but it was out on loan. However, I did see Hendrick Avercamp's ''Enjoying the Ice,'' a pell-mell scene of life along the frozen canals in the early 17th century, in which several people are playing kolfspel.</p>
        <p>Two of the best inland courses in Holland are Utrechtse Golfclub 'De Pan' and Hilversumsche Golf Club, both set in piney heathland. De Pan is in Bosch en Duin, outside Utrecht, a lively university city with innumerable cafes and flowering chestnut trees along its central canal, the Oudegracht. Founded in 1894, De Pan is the country's second oldest golf club, but moved to its present site in 1929. The clubhouse, with a statue of Pan playing his flute in front, has a steep, oversized thatched roof.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere is friendly and informal and the course, designed by Colt in the classic English heathland style, curves through stands of pine, birch, oak, acacia and sweet and wild chestnut. There are some lovely holes where you drive over valleys of heather and sand, including the 6th, 7th and 10th.</p>
        <p>Standing on the elevated 15th tee, it is clear that the same vision that went into creating Sunningdale and Wentworth outside London, the courses for which Colt is best known, is at work here. The drive is over the braided branches of dwarf pines to a straightaway fairway with the tapering bunkers down both sides set off against dark, encircling pines.</p>
        <p>Hilversumsche, which dates from 1910, is less than half an hour's drive north of Utrecht. An attractive town with some surprisingly modernist Dutch architecture, Hilversum is set in the heart of the Gooi, an area of woods and lakes east of Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>Hilversumsche played host to the Dutch Open for seven straight years, which, much to the chagrin of the engaging caddiemaster, was being played this year at Noordwijkse. A sylvan, secluded course, its symbol is the kievit bird, or lapwing. The pines cast long shadows over the beautifully conditioned fairways and greens, which are guarded by steep grass-faced bunkers. Many of the holes are separated by leafy little country lanes with wooden gates, which adds to the strong sense of seclusion.</p>
        <p>No golfing trip to the Netherlands  would be complete without a visit to Golf Club De Haar. Only nine holes,  it's nonetheless an enchanting course in an enchanted setting, on the grounds of Kastel De Haar. Next to the village of Haarzuilens, near Utrecht, it is not far from Breukelen, which gave its name to Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Rising from a moat, the castle is the largest in the Netherlands, dating to the 14th century or earlier. It was burned by the army of Louis XIV in 1672 and by the time Baron Etienne van Zuylen van Nijevelt van de Haar inherited it in 1890, the castle lay in ruins. The baron and his wife, Helene de Rothschild, restored the place in all its medieval neo-Gothic glory. It's well worth taking a tour of the elaborately furnished castle, which is open to the public except in September, when the current Baron van Zuylen and his family are there.</p>
        <p>The adjoining golf course was built in 1974, and the baron, the grandson of the van Zuylen who restored the castle, is himself a golfer. The clubhouse was once a stable for the deer that roamed the park, where the animals slept in what is now the sunken bar.</p>
        <p>The golf course is dominated by the trees, transported to the grounds at the turn of the century from every cranny of Utrecht province so that the baron would have a fully mature park in the English style. Altogether, his landscape gardener transplanted 7,000 trees, which are now 150 years old. Each hole is an arboreal revelation, as the course threads through mighty red and green beech, ash, lindens, chestnuts, planes, poplars and wild cherry. In a field guide to each hole published by the club, one can identify the ''Bomen op De Haar,'' or ''Trees of De Haar.''</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding all the trees, the holes are imaginative and fun to play. The second is a par 3 over a creek with the green in a gap in an allee of ash trees. The par 5 fourth hole, the best on the course, curves right to left with the creek running down the left, an island of maples protecting the green, and, in May, sprays of white and red flowering hawthorn to the right. On the sixth hole, you hear the caterwauling of a peacock that lives in the sand trap next to the green.</p>
        <p>On the ninth hole, the second par 5, the drive must carry the corner of a large lily pond, and the castle with its red brick walls and pointed black spires looms fully into view as you near the green. The only disappointing thing about De Haar is that it's just nine holes, but then, you can always go around again.</p>
        <p>Seaside and inland, 6 top courses in low country</p>
        <p>Private courses in the Netherlands generally allow visitors during the week but not on weekends. You should call a course's caddiemaster to arrange a tee time. The clubs require a maximum handicap, which varies from 26 to 28, and it is advisable to have a handicap card.</p>
        <p>The average greens fee is about $55, at 2.3 guilders to the dollar. Most Dutch golfers use pull carts, which can usually be rented, but motorized carts are rarely used. Most of the clubs accept credit cards, but not De Pan and Hilversumsche. Everyone at the golf courses speaks English.</p>

        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>The courses are close enough to Amsterdam that you can make the city your base, but here are some hotels near the courses:</p>
        <p>Grand Hotel Huis ter Duin, Koningen Astrid Boulevard 5, Noordwijk aan Zee, (31-71) 361-9220, fax (31-71) 361-9401, www.huisterduin.com.
