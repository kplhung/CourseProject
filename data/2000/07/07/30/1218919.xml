        <p>FOR just one evening, this city is trying not to ooze misery. It deployed the Public Works Department's only grass cutter to mow vacant lots downtown, forsaking 2,000 others that need tending. The streets need cleaning, but the city's seven sweepers are old and broken. Camden has 3,500 vacant buildings, but only a three-man crew to keep them boarded up.</p>
        <p>The Republicans are coming to Camden tonight, and the task of making the East St. Louis of the East presentable would have challenged Potemkin himself.</p>
        <p>Welcoming ceremonies for the Republican National Convention will be held on Camden's waterfront, the only redeveloped slice of the city. It offers great views of Philadelphia's skyline, and of the lighted boat show and fireworks planned on the Delaware River.</p>
        <p>But coming to New Jersey through Camden is like entering a split-level through the mud room, and cleaning for the guests has been a chore.</p>
        <p>Just over the Ben Franklin Bridge from Philadelphia, state and regional officials recently spent $45 million to condemn and level the unsightly buildings of businesses on Admiral Wilson Boulevard, including topless joints and by-the-hour hotels.</p>
        <p>Camden has 209 miles of roads, but attention has focused on four routes through downtown to the waterfront. Crumbling buildings have been knocked down, rotting trees uprooted, flowers and shrubs planted, broken windows covered with fresh gray boards and light posts decked with banners. The road to the newly docked U.S.S. New Jersey is lined with shipping containers that hide industrial detritus. On the waterfront, mulch has been blown among fresh beds of flowers, and at the Children's Garden near the state aquarium, the newest creature is an elephant topiary named George, as in W.</p>
        <p>''That first impression is important,'' said Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, tonight's host. But it can also mislead.</p>
        <p>As the V.I.P.'s gaze at Philadelphia, here's what will be festering in the city of 82,000 behind their backs: school dropout rates as high as 60 percent. Almost 40 percent of households earning less than $20,000. A tax base that yields only about $29 million for combined city and school expenses of $350 million. A mayor indicted on corruption charges, like two of his last four predecessors.</p>
        <p>''It's a casualty,'' said the Rev. Michael Doyle, a priest in South Camden for 32 years, ''and America is to blame for a Camden. They don't see it that way. It's like a drunk on a grate and people say, 'It's not my problem.' If you can't save a Camden in a powerful economy, then when will we be able to make it livable? When?''</p>
        <p>There are glimmers of hope -- a few remaining corporations, the waterfront, some renovated housing -- but they are hard to spot amid weed-choked lots, abandoned homes and the addicted roaming like stray dogs.</p>
        <p>GOVERNOR Whitman, who is waging a legislative battle to seize control of Camden, said she was shaken by the depth of its problems during a nighttime tour with state troopers in 1996. That trip recently produced a photo of the smiling governor frisking an innocent black man. Back here Thursday to award some grants, she said that after that tour, ''all I could think of was: What would I have been like if this was my environment growing up?''</p>
        <p>Shinnelle Queensbury, perhaps, could suggest an answer. At 14, she lives in the South Camden neighborhood the governor visited the other day. Despite a family history laced with drugs and prison, Shinnelle is a serious student at the Creative Arts High School, taking summer enrichment courses and singing and dancing in a local production of ''Secrets Every Smart Traveler Should Know.'' Despite the pressures of the street, she could do a one-girl show of the same name for tonight's visitors.</p>
        <p>''Wait until you get to my block,'' she said, leaving the commotion around the governor. She lives with her grandparents, and there is only one other house on her side of the street that is not boarded up. ''A brick fell out of that house and almost hit me,'' she said of a crumbling building on the corner.</p>
        <p>On her block, she said, ''the police patrol, but the drug boys run.'' Her teachers are encouraging, but neighbors razz her because, she said, ''I like to talk with proper English.'' Imagine coming home from school happy, she said, only to learn that ''one of your relatives has done something wrong or someone was shot in front of your aunt's house.''</p>
        <p>Long ago, Camden adopted Walt Whitman's poetic line, ''In a dream I saw a city invincible.'' That dream is long gone, but flashes of resilience remain. ''I'm really trying,'' Shinnelle Queensbury said, crossing the deserted street on her way to sing and dance, ''but there's so many things pulling me down.''</p>
