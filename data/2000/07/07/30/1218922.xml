        <p>President Alberto K. Fujimori harshly attacked his opponents today, blaming them for rioting on Friday that left six people dead, and his prime minister warned that organizers of the protest could be prosecuted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori, speaking to top officials of the military, said that opponents had plotted to set fire to the Congress building to prevent his inauguration to a third term, but that security forces had stopped them.</p>
        <p>The colonial center of Lima was converted into a smoky battlefield during the inauguration, as thousands of demonstrators charged police barricades, threw firebombs, set bonfires and vandalized government offices. The police arrested scores of people, but not before fires raged out of control in several public buildings. The rioting left 190 people injured, and 172 people were arrested.</p>
        <p>''Of course there is responsibility, and it lies with those who organized the march,'' Prime Minister Federico Salas said. ''This is now in the hands of the federal prosecutor.''</p>
        <p>Some experts saw the comments as a hint that opposition leaders, including Alejandro Toledo, could be arrested. Mr. Toledo ran against Mr. Fujimori but dropped out of the race a week before the May runoff, saying the election was fraudulent. He said Friday's damage and deaths were caused by government intelligence agents who infiltrated the crowds. ''If they blame us, they cannot get away with that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The six people who died Friday were all bystanders -- five security guards and one driver at the National Bank, which was set ablaze. Firefighters said they could not put out the fires quickly because their trucks were blocked by rioters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori shuffled part of his cabinet today, appointing as economy minister Carlos Bolona, who engineered sweeping privatizations and deregulation policies in the early years of the president's first term.</p>
        <p>The appointment of Mr. Bolona is intended to improve relations with foreign investors and businessmen, who have complained that Mr. Fujimori is becoming a populist. Since his re-election to a third five-year term, Mr. Fujimori has pushed through legislation that suspended several privatizations and withdrew tax benefits to foreign mining companies.</p>
        <p>In his inaugural speech, Mr. Fujimori spoke of replacing imports by increasing government support for several industries. But he also promised to reduce government deficits and keep inflation down to 4 percent.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Mr. Bolona has been critical of the government for overspending, but during the election campaign he came to the president's defense and sharply criticized Mr. Toledo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori also changed his interior, industry, labor and agriculture ministers. The cabinet changes came less than a week after he replaced Prime Minister Alberto Bustamante, a moderate who was pushing for democratic reforms, with Mr. Salas, the mayor of a small town who ran against Mr. Fujimori this year and won 2 percent of the vote. Mr. Fujimori said the move was intended to bring the ''responsible opposition'' into his government.</p>
        <p>During the campaign, Mr. Salas called for the replacement of Vladimiro Montesinos, the intelligence chief held responsible by international observers for organizing campaign dirty tricks. In the last week, Mr. Salas has dropped his criticism.</p>
