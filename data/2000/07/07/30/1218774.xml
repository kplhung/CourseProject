      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Westchester has set up a Web-based Community Help Desk to help young people and the elderly who need professional services. The Help Desk, found on the county's Web site at www.westchestergov.com, provides information from more than 40 experts.  For example, a person concerned about a youngster in emotional trouble can be directed to a youth officer or a help line. The site is expected to be expanded to include other areas of government, including welfare programs and the use of county parks. The program will also eventually set up appointments, offer applications for services, provide directions and bus schedules, arrange for transportation and offer live contact, where a user can talk to someone through the computer.</p>
