        <p>Republican national convention in Philadelphia is likely to highlight party's effort to refashion itself, taking cue from Pres Clinton's successful repositioning of Democratic Party toward the middle in 1992; Republican presidential aspirant George W Bush has even appropriated Clinton's claim of being 'a different kind of Democrat,' telling audiences he is 'a different kind of Republican'; photo (M)</p>

        <p>THERE are three things you will have to look hard for as you tune in to the Republican National Convention here this week: A true-blue conservative icon on center stage. (There may be a few, but they will be sprinkled in a line-up that resembles a Benetton commercial.) Any utterance of the word ''abortion.'' (You're more likely to hear the words, ''poor'' or ''underclass.'') The traditional savaging of the opposition. (Instead, look for subtle denigrations of the Clinton-Gore years and bipartisan overtures.)</p>
        <p>If the Republicans seem timid about bashing President Clinton this year, it's only fitting. That's because they've stolen his political game plan. In fact the Grand Old Party is attempting to refashion itself entirely, clearly using Mr. Clinton as its model.</p>
        <p>Eight years after Mr. Clinton captured the White House by venturing toward the middle and running against some of the orthodoxies of his party -- including those on welfare, teacher unions and racial quotas -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is trying a similar approach. While Mr. Bush is not moving as far as Mr. Clinton in forsaking the principles of his party, he sounds a lot like a Democrat when he holds forth about protecting Social Security, reaching out to the dispossessed and lavishing more money on public education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush last week startled Democrats and Republicans alike when he spoke out about prescription drug benefits for the elderly. Mr. Bush has even appropriated Mr. Clinton's mantra from 1992, ''a different kind of Democrat.'' He would be ''a different kind of Republican,'' he reassures audiences.</p>
        <p>This weekend, Republicans are advertising ''a different kind of convention.'' This is what Americans will see on stage: A single mom. A grandmother and granddaughter talking about Social Security. A rank-and-file union member discussing his economic plight. A teacher chatting about education reform.</p>
        <p>But to win the White House, Mr. Bush must prove that he is doing more than muffling the vitriol by yanking the Patrick Buchanans and Marilyn Quayles and Phil Gramms offstage. His challenge is to assemble a new Republican majority with the help of constituencies that voted Democratic four years ago.</p>
        <p>To do that, he has to convince voters that he is not beholden to the right wing. With some success, polls show, Mr. Bush is making a play for the blue-collar Democrats and suburban women who backed Mr. Clinton overwhelmingly four years ago. He is reaching out aggressively to Latino voters. He even dared to speak before the N.A.A.C.P., not because he thought he could convert African American voters -- among the Democratic Party's most loyal backers --- but because of the signal it would send to moderates that he is inclusive.</p>
        <p>Part of the calculation, too, is that such appeals could at the very least give minorities less reason to mobilize against Republicans on Election Day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush can afford to reach out to moderates this year because the base of his own party, ravenous to reclaim the White House, is willing to make compromises. Not since the love fest for Ronald Reagan in 1984 have Republicans appeared so harmonious on the eve of their convention.</p>
        <p>''If you spend one day of this convention making Republicans happy, you're wasting your time because they already are,'' said Rick Davis, a top official at four past Republican conventions.</p>
        <p>As the campaign intensifies, though, Mr. Gore and the Democrats will increasingly portray Mr. Bush as Newt Gingrich without the scowl. To this end, they were handed some potent ammunition last week, when Mr. Bush picked Dick Cheney as his running mate.</p>
        <p>The Cheney pairing suggested that Mr. Bush was harkening to his party's conservative past rather than seeking a partner who could broaden the ticket's ideological appeal. Mr. Clinton, in contrast, won credibility as a reconfigured Democrat by picking Al Gore -- assembling a southern moderate ticket.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not have to settle on a conservative. He has the latitude denied Bob Dole when, four years ago, he picked Jack Kemp as his running mate. Mr. Dole, however, needed someone to rouse the party's conservative faithful, who had not rallied around him, as they have around Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition, said he was reassured by the Cheney pick. ''The fact that he's reaching out to swing voters is not a bad thing,'' he said. ''You can trust the candidate. You know where he's coming from philosophically. He's not doing anything to alienate his base. That's the important thing.''</p>
        <p>Will he be as successful at co-opting -- or at least taming -- the opposition as Mr. Clinton? Or will he fail, as did Michael Dukakis in 1988? In that year's campaign, Vice President George Bush effectively branded him a Massachusetts liberal and card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>
        <p>Thus far, Mr. Bush and the Republicans have had it both ways. It happened this weekend in Philadelphia. The Bush-controlled Republican Party drafted a platform that cast off several hard-edged party positions of the past, like abolishing the Education Department and the National Endowment for the Arts. The hostile language toward immigration four years ago was substituted with a tribute to the role of new Americans. But conservatives were not neglected. The platform contained a reaffirmation of its ban on abortion -- with no exceptions -- despite a drive on Friday by some party members to soften the langauge.</p>
        <p>It happened in Austin last week. There Mr. Bush was, introducing to the world a running mate who had one of the most conservative voting records in Congress. But in their oratory, they sounded as Democratic as Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush declared that he called upon Mr. Cheney to help him ''accomplish some great goals'' for the nation: ''To save and strengthen Social Security. To improve Medicare and provide prescription drugs for the elderly. To reform our public schools.'' All but the last point -- ''To rebuild our military to keep the peace'' -- sounded like they would be more likely to issue from Al Gore's mouth.</p>
        <p>The Democrats, of course, are already  working hard not to let Mr. Bush get away with this balancing act. They argue that many of his proposals for new spending on social projects are modest and symbolic. And most of these proposals, they note, offer traditionally Republican solutions that rely heavily on the power of the private sector, as in his plan to privatize Social Security or his endorsement of vouchers to allow public money to go to private schools.</p>
        <p>Voters may recognize that there are some real ideological divides between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore. A New York Times/CBS News Poll last week showed that the public sees stark differences in how they would handle taxes, health care, abortion and the environment.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Bush's right-down-the-middle tactics may succeed. Both parties have a history of remaking themselves. In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower refused to tear down elements of the New Deal and spoke loftily about retooling the Republican Party. While Mr. Bush calls himself a ''compassionate conservative,'' Mr. Eisenhower favored the term ''dynamic conservatism.''</p>
        <p>William J. Bennett, the former education secretary, said the convention strategy is too middle-of-the-road for his taste, but defends it as smart politics.''The convention is not as right-wing as I am,'' he said. ''They're not taking advice from the old Washington hands. They're following their own counsel -- and doing it brilliantly.''</p>
        <p>Yet while prominent conservatives are staying silent as their bread-and-butter issues -- prayer in school, and opposing abortion and homosexual rights -- get short shrift (or no shrift at all), Mr. Bush could be risking his relations with others on the right, who worry that the party is losing its soul.</p>
        <p>David A. Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, warned that Mr. Bush had better be careful that his overtures to moderates do not become more substantive. ''The feel-good stuff and atmospherics is all fine,'' he said. ''But when push comes to shove, Republicans win elections in which there is a clear distinction between their position and the Democratic position on the issues. If you spend all your time reaching out, you're putting your base in danger.''</p>
        <p>For now, Mr. Bush seems to be having more luck reassuring conservatives than his father, former President George Bush, whose was never fully trusted on the right.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robertson, for one, is haunted by the elder Bush's speech, written by Peggy Noonan, at the 1988 Republican convention at which the nominee uttered his famous anti-tax pledge. ''I just hope and pray he doesn't have Peggy Noonan write, 'Read My Lips,' '' Mr. Robertson said. ''We don't need any tax pledge redux!''</p>
        <p>So the right is watching. But if the younger Bush has learned anything from his father, it is that if you try to tack right and then dance to the center, you can end up falling off the political stage.</p>
