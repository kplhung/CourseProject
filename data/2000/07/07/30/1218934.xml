        <p>Repeatedly brushing aside amendments from its embattled liberal wing, the Democratic Party's platform committee today adopted a party blueprint that hews closely to Vice President Al Gore's centrist views on trade, fiscal policy, national defense, crime and welfare.</p>

        <p>Repeatedly brushing aside amendments from its embattled liberal wing, the Democratic Party's platform committee today adopted a party blueprint that hews closely to Vice President Al Gore's centrist views on trade, fiscal policy, national defense, crime and welfare.</p>
        <p>The 48-page document approved today was a fitting successor to the platform created for Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign in 1992, which broke sharply from the party's liberal roots. Today, the 186-member committee, dominated by Gore supporters, again and again knocked down efforts to tug the party back toward the left.</p>
        <p>Proposals supporting universal health care, a moratorium on the death penalty, punishments against corporations that pay low wages, tougher rules for international trade, and better health care for prisoners were withdrawn or overwhelmingly defeated.</p>
        <p>Over the objections of a small band of liberals, the committee approved planks putting the party firmly behind a limited missile defense system, aggressive debt reduction, modest tax cuts and expanding global trade through the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>The liberals did not go down quietly. Talking to reporters outside the committee room, members of a group calling itself the Progressive Caucus to the Democratic National Convention complained that their views had been ignored and that the Gore campaign had pressured committee members to vote against their planks.</p>
        <p>''They talk about a big tent,'' said Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Cleveland. ''But this tent just got a bit smaller.''</p>
        <p>Tom Hayden, a state senator from Los Angeles who is also a Gore delegate, said the platform had failed to address the challenge of Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate who strongly opposes the World Trade Organization and who, polls show, has been drawing voters away from Mr. Gore in California.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hayden said the center-straddling platform would turn off the party's liberal base, making it more difficult to find committed campaign foot-soldiers. As a result, he warned, Mr. Gore would have to rely on negative attacks against the Republican ticket of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Dick Cheney.</p>
        <p>''It's very hard to lift the enthusiasm of tens of thousands of people to make phone calls,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Progressive Caucus did not have much support in the room today.</p>
        <p>No major environmental groups were present to raise objections to the platform.</p>
        <p>An observer for the United Auto Workers, which objects to Mr. Gore's trade policies and has not endorsed him, said the platform committee had addressed the union's concerns in private negotiations.</p>
        <p>And an official with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has endorsed Mr. Gore, said that despite its flaws, the platform was generally acceptable to organized labor, the single most important constituency in the Democratic coalition.</p>
        <p>''We've succeeded in moving the party from free trade toward fair trade,'' said Gerald Shea, an adviser to John Sweeney, the president of the labor federation.</p>
        <p>Despite the complaints from the liberals, party leaders portrayed the platform debate as more open than the Republicans' process. And they said that the fault lines within their party over trade and national defense are not as deep as those dividing the Republicans on abortion and education.</p>
        <p>''There are sections of this platform that I am not wild about,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, a co-chairman of the platform committee. ''But the bottom line is, we know how much different and how much better this is than the Republican alternative.''</p>
        <p>Al From, chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group, said, ''Don't forget, we followed a lot of the policies the Progressive Caucus would like us to follow now in the 1970's and 80's, and we had the kind of stagnation that turned core Democrats away from us.''</p>
        <p>The platform goes to a full vote by the delegates on the second night of the Democratic convention next month. No amendments will be allowed from the floor, and it seems unlikely that liberals will be able to muster enough support to force a floor vote on a minority report.</p>
        <p>One of the liveliest debates today was over a proposal to strike language endorsing development of a limited national missile defense system.</p>
        <p>Liberals contended that the idea was unproven, costly and likely to ignite a new arms race. But Mr. Gore's supporters argued that remaining silent on missile defense would give the Republicans ammunition to attack Democrats as soft on defense. Mr. Bush supports a global missile defense system. The progressives' amendment was tabled.</p>
        <p>On the contentious issue of trade, the platform says, ''It's clear we live in a globalized world, and that there is no turning back.'' The platform obliquely endorses a concept known as fast track -- without using that phrase -- calling for broad presidential powers to negotiate trade compacts without Congressional approval.</p>
        <p>To appease labor unions and environmental groups, the platform says workers rights, human rights and environmental protections should be negotiated in all trade agreements.</p>
        <p>On crime, the platform endorses ''tougher penalties -- including the death penalty -- for those that dare to terrorize the innocent.'' But it also calls for DNA testing and ''effective'' legal counsel for death row inmates.</p>
        <p>A few members of the committee had proposed calling for a moratorium on capital punishment. But they withdrew the amendment for lack of support. Instead, the committee adopted this language: ''In all death row cases, we encourage thorough post-conviction reviews.''</p>
        <p>The platform adopts debt reduction -- President Clinton's guiding economic principle -- as the heart of Mr. Gore's economic policies. And it calls for using the federal surplus to strengthen Medicare and Social Security.</p>
        <p>In its longest section, on education, the platform supports using federal money to increase teachers' pay, reduce class sizes, rebuild crumbling schools and help families pay for college tuition. But it also calls for requiring teachers to pass periodic reviews making it easier to close down failing schools.</p>
        <p>The platform, like Mr. Gore's campaign agenda, firmly endorses a woman's right to an abortion, strong gun regulations, a hate crimes law, sweeping campaign finance reform and an end to racial profiling.</p>
        <p>On the environment, supporters of Mr. Gore proposed an amendment endorsing several of the vice president's campaign pledges: to restore the Everglades, restrict oil and gas drilling off the coasts of California and Florida and prohibit drilling or logging in the wildest areas of the national forests.</p>
        <p>Committee members from Alaska and many of the Western states objected to the language, saying it would hurt local economies. But the measure passed by the narrowest vote of the day, 47 to 33.</p>
