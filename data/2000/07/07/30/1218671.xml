        <p>IN the tony East End, even ocean life can be subject to rules of exclusivity.</p>
        <p>But after a $2,000, 150-foot experimental net failed to keep jellyfish from a children's swim area at Meschutt Beach County Park last summer, Hampton Bays abandoned plans to erect a larger $30,000 net this season. Instead, the community has begrudgingly accepted the stinging predator in its shallow waters.</p>
        <p>One pair of scientists observed that it resembles a mop hiding beneath a dinner plate. And a famous author took license by exaggerating the threat of its sting: ''Behold the lion's mane!'' cried Sherlock Holmes as he revealed the murderer in an Arthur Conan Doyle story, declaring the jellyfish deadlier than a cobra.</p>
        <p>But the lion's mane jellyfish, whose 6- to 8-inch red bell and long orange tentacles stir both fear and awe as it gracefully pulses with the currents all along the East Coast, is hardly the thorniest of the ocean's beautiful blossoms.</p>
        <p>The lion's mane, the jellyfish most common along the Island and other East Coast shores, inflicts its most serious damage on those who are allergic to its protein-based toxins or unlucky enough to be struck in the eye by the microscopic harpoons on its flailing tentacles.</p>
        <p>Now on its annual visit, the lion's mane (Cyanea capillata) is beginning to appear in larger numbers, along with the sea nettle (Chrysaora quinquecirrha), a jellyfish that has been sighted less frequently.</p>
        <p>For a seasonal regular, however, the jellyfish has come under remarkably little scrutiny. By the end of the Labor Day weekend, it will drift from memory like a pair of lost sunglasses.</p>
        <p>''It's not a group of animals that's heavily studied,'' said Sandra Shumway, a biology and marine science professor at the Long Island University campus at Southampton College. ''They're not commercially important, so they don't get the attention that perhaps they should.''</p>
        <p>Some lifeguards and health officials, citing a conventional theory that water temperature regulates the population of the gelatinous blobs, forecast a light jellyfish season. ''The water's been cool all spring,'' said Bill Stockdale, supervisor of emergency medical services at Jones Beach State Park. ''It's just starting to warm up over the last two weeks.''</p>
        <p>What is known about the lion's mane jellyfish is that they are mostly sexually mature adults that scientists trace to the ocean's deeper reaches. The adults shed their sperm and eggs, which, when fertilized, form larvae that grow into tiny bottom-dwelling polyps. Those develop into what resembles a small stack of pancakes, each of which is released and forms a jellyfish.</p>
        <p>''The metamorphosis that makes them a jellyfish is probably triggered by an elevation of water temperatures,'' said Peter Anderson, a jellyfish expert and director of the Whitney Laboratory at the University of Florida in Marineland. ''That's why you see them during the summer.''</p>
        <p>But the numbers of jellyfish and their arrival dates are nearly impossible to predict because prevailing winds and currents dictate their movements.</p>
        <p>''We haven't had any offshore storms so nothing seems to be pushing them in our direction right now, and we're lucky,'' Joe Scalice, director of water safety for the state beaches on Long Island, said last week. ''There's no major congregation right now, but it could change tomorrow and we could be loaded.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, experts said they could only guess why some summers brought more jellyfish than others, or why the South Shore was sometimes more heavily populated with jellyfish than the North Shore, or vice versa.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, nature's roulette wheel turned up an Arctic variety of lion's mane jellyfish off the Island whose hoods were ''as big as garbage pail lids,'' said Tim Delaney, chief of lifeguards for the Suffolk County Parks Department. And 14 years ago, he said, seven Portuguese men-of-war, a more dangerous relative of the lion's mane, washed ashore at Smith Point County Park.</p>
        <p>Jellyfish tentacles have thousands of stinging cells, or nematocysts, containing toxic threads that are triggered by chemical or physical contact. The threads then unfold and discharge like harpoons.</p>
        <p>Although lion's mane jellyfish contain toxic proteins and peptides like those in more lethal species, they cause fewer fatalities because their harpoonlike threads shoot out in a curve, slowing penetration.</p>
        <p>Still, lion's mane jellyfish are not necessarily tame.</p>
        <p>They hurt when they sting, leaving large red welts or ridged zigzag lines across the skin that mirror the path of lashing tentacles. ''Poisonous and Venomous Marine Animals of the World'' by Bruce W. Halstead and Donovan A. Courville, classifies the stings of the genus Cyanea as ''moderate to severe.''</p>
        <p>Scientists know more about how not to treat a jellyfish sting -- fresh water should never be applied, they advise -- than a positive remedy.</p>
        <p>Arthur Goldberg, a marine toxin expert and professor of chemistry and environmental science at Southampton College, said fresh water increased pressure in the nematocysts and induced the discharge of the threads.</p>
        <p>Barefoot beachgoers could feel discomfort if they walk on the tentacles of some species that have washed ashore. But the stinging threads of lion's mane jellyfish are unlikely to pierce the thicker skin on soles or palms, Dr. Goldberg said, though fresh water could discharge their nematocysts and damage other tissue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stockdale acknowledged that he treated jellyfish stings with warm fresh water until about 15 years ago, when Nassau County health authorities withdrew a recommendation to use fresh water. But few seem aware of the risks of fresh-water treatment, even today.</p>
        <p>Andrew Terry, a Jones Beach lifeguard, learned this lesson painfully last summer when a jellyfish stung his left eye during a swim. Mr. Terry, 53, of Babylon, was treated with a 30-minute fresh-water irrigation before an ophthalmologist found the remains of tentacles in his eye.</p>
        <p>''I guess I inadvertently did more damage to myself,'' said Mr. Terry, who became a lifeguard after retiring four years ago as a Justice Department agent. Treated with a salt solution and antibiotics after the fresh-water flushing, Mr. Terry was blinded for 24 hours. (His vision returned to normal.) He never enters the water now without goggles.</p>
        <p>Eight-year-old Joelle Giammusso of Long Beach also treated her jellyfish sting with fresh water.</p>
        <p>''I was at Jones Beach and was playing in the water and I didn't even know I got stung until I got out,'' she said, ''and then I went in the shower when I went home and it got a lot worse. It was much redder and it itched a lot. Before the shower it was just a big red mark. I thought the shower would make the red mark go away.''</p>
        <p>She said her jellyfish encounter prompted her to stop picking up dead jellyfish on the beach. ''Now I just throw shells at them,'' she said. ''I used to poke them and pick up the gooey jelly and throw it back in the ocean.''</p>
        <p>Joelle made the right decision; scientists warn against contact with dead jellyfish. Although the lion's mane does not have stinging cells on its bell, said Larry Madin, senior scientist and biology chairman at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts, tentacles shorn by the battering of the surf could be nearby and may have active stinging cells.</p>
        <p>Dead jellyfish with an active sting contributed to the failure of the Hampton Bays jellyfish blockade last summer. Thrashing waves pushed pieces of dead animals with active stingers through the net like a strainer, and live jellyfish made their way over the middle, which sagged under the weight of trapped seaweed and sand.</p>
        <p>One preventive measure that appears to work is waterproof suntan lotion. Scientists are unclear, however, whether stinging cells do not discharge because of the absence of the necessary chemical stimulus in the lotion, or whether the lotion simply blocks the toxic threads from penetrating the skin, said Richard Mariscal, a Florida State University biology professor who specializes in marine stings.</p>
        <p>Even more debatable than prevention are the methods to treat stings. Dr. Madin, for instance, prescribes vinegar as the best antidote to neutralize the stings of the lion's mane and sea nettle.</p>
        <p>Others employ alcohol to dry the wounded flesh, though reaching for a beer is taboo because of its high water content. Still others swear by meat tenderizer, which contains papain, an enzyme derived from papaya that is said to break down proteins in the toxin.</p>
        <p>''I've heard people say that they're not sure meat tenderizer is that effective,'' Dr. Madin said. ''I've also heard people say that most of these things are placebos and if you rub sand on it, it works just as well.''</p>
        <p>Prevention  Experts suggest a number of ways to reduce the chance of jellyfish stings:</p>
        <p>* Wear waterproof sunblock.</p>
        <p>* Wear a Lycra wetsuit.</p>
        <p>* Wear goggles or a facemask.</p>
        <p>* Keep your distance; lion's mane tentacles can reach 10 feet.</p>
        <p>* Don't touch dead jellyfish.</p>
        <p>Treatment</p>
        <p>In case of an encounter, these steps can ease the pain:</p>
        <p>* Dry your skin.</p>
        <p>* Avoid rubbing the area.</p>
        <p>* Gently peel off tentacles with a twig or stick.</p>
        <p>* Do not rinse with water.</p>
        <p>* Apply meat tenderizer, vinegar or dry sand.</p>
