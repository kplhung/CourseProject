        <p>FROM Washington, it seems odd that Senator Robert G. Torricelli would want to be governor of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''He had really begun to build himself a power base in Washington,'' observed Norman Ornstein of American Enterprise Institute, who has analyzed politicians' behavior for years. ''I'm still trying to get my arms around it.''</p>
        <p>From Trenton, it makes a lot more sense. Here, the governor's office is the place to make legislation happen, to reward and punish and to generally see people trailing obsequiously in one's wake. When it comes to power, the governor, as the only elected state official, has minimal competition.</p>
        <p>So while the political conventions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles soak up the media attention and Jon S. Corzine and Robert D. Franks battle toward the most expensive Senate campaign in history, the conventional wisdom in New Jersey is that the election in November 2001 -- choosing a successor to  Governor Whitman -- is the only one that really counts.</p>
        <p>Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean put it this way: ''In the interest of the political establishment, it outweighs the presidential race. We have a Senate contest this year, and nobody cares. Everybody is already talking about who's going to be the next governor, and they have been for a long time. And the election isn't even till next year.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kean recalled that John Sununu, President George Bush's one-time chief of staff and a former governor of New Hampshire, called him ''Ayatollah Kean,'' and he quoted a line from the conservative columnist George Will that a New Jersey governor is ''an American Caesar.'' And in crediting his  advisers with talking back to him, Mr. Kean said, ''It's easy for people to be afraid of the governor.''</p>
        <p>This state is nothing like New York, for example, with a lieutenant governor, attorney general, comptroller and at least one big-city mayor who are willing and often able to sabotage the governor. And in Texas, Gov. George W. Bush does not have a formal cabinet but a collection of sometimes wayward officials, like the agriculture commissioner, who are elected and have power of their own.</p>
        <p>Governor Whitman, while laughing amiably one recent afternoon at the notion that people are afraid of her, concurred that 'the governor does have extraordinary powers in this state.''</p>
        <p>Sticking to the tangible, constitutionally granted variety, she cited the conditional veto, by which she can effectively tell the Legislature what terms she will require for her signature, and the line-item veto.</p>
        <p>Indeed, after State Senator John Lynch, a Democrat from New Brunswick, cast the Senate's only dissenting vote on Mrs. Whitman's budget last month, she penciled out $300,000 worth of projects for his district.</p>
        <p>''There's hardly anybody who's active in public life who doesn't want something from the governor,' said Carl E. Van Horn, a political scientist at Rutgers who was Gov. Jim Florio's policy director. ''The line I always heard was, 'Why would anyone care who's the U.S. Senator from New Jersey? After all, its only 24 jobs. The governor has thousands of jobs.' ''</p>
        <p>Moreover, the governor's thousands of jobs include all the important ones: attorney general, treasurer, secretary of state, many subcabinet positions and all the county prosecutors and state judges. They also include appointments -- some unpaid but ego-enhancing -- to every board from the New Jersey Birthplace of Football Monument Commission to the Rahway Valley Sewerage Authority.</p>
        <p>There are a few other states -- Tennessee, Maine and New Hampshire -- where the governor is the only elected state official, but those governors have to share appointment powers with the legislature. Here, the Legislature -- specifically, the Senate -- can only consent.</p>
        <p>Then there are the media advantages. Carl Golden, who was press secretary in both the Kean and Whitman administrations, said Mrs. Whitman in particular, ''a terrific television presence,'' knew how to work her way into a national forum.</p>
        <p>''That wouldn't have come her way if she were the governor of Delaware,'' Mr. Golden said. ''If you want those New York and Philadelphia stations, you're in the right place. That's why God invented Bergen County and Cherry Hill.''</p>
        <p>Whatever their measure of power, scholars generally agree that among governors, New Jersey's is at the top of the list. Altogether, the governorship ''is like royalty'' here, Mr. Van Horn said. ''Its very different from other states.''</p>
        <p>To the small cast of those willing to complain out loud, who in Governor Whitman's case are principally environmental groups and activists with black and Hispanic constituencies, it is indeed an imperial office. And as public crises tend to illustrate, the state's business is administered by a limited circle that owes its allegiance -- and salaries -- to the governor.</p>
        <p>Take the volatile issue of racial profiling that showed the State Police had a history of stopping an inordinate number of minority motorists. The governor appoints the State Police superintendent, who reports to the attorney general, also appointed by the governor. When accusations reached a critical level last year, the investigation fell to the attorney general, Peter G. Verniero -- Governor Whitman's former chief of staff and now a State Supreme Court justice appointed by her -- who had insisted for two years that incidents of bias were isolated at most. At the same time, Mr. Verniero's office was appealing a Superior Court decision in Gloucester County that had found ''a de facto policy of racial profiling'' by troopers.</p>
        <p>While Mrs. Whitman publicly deplored the practice and dismissed the police superintendant, she defended her attorney general and, after the intervention of the Justice Department, named him to the state's High Court. There, incidentally, he joined four other justices out of six who had been top staff members of the governor's who appointed them.</p>
        <p>WALTER FIELDS, a Democratic political consultant in Trenton who has worked in New York, said such a scenario was unlikely in that state. ''There are a lot of layers of politics in New York that you don't have in New Jersey,'' Mr. Fields said.</p>
        <p>First are the elected counterweights to the governor, and not just the other state officials. ''To be borough president of Manhattan or Brooklyn is really important,'' he said. ''In New Jersey, the analogy is county executive, and they dont really matter.''</p>
        <p>Then, Mr. Fields said, there are the unofficial centers of power: ''You have the third parties, the advocates. You have Al Sharpton, Calvin Butts. Those people, outside the institutions, become larger than life. Even the labor unions have more power. Even the Catholic Church.''</p>
        <p>Professor Van Horn said that while New Jersey was ''a model of efficient accountability, it did not succeed in insuring diverse voices and viewpoints.''</p>
        <p>''Accountability and efficiency are not the only things that matter,'' he said. ''On balance, I think it's better to have diversity. I believe in the distribution of power across institutions.''</p>
        <p>But when New Jersey's Constitution was rewritten in 1947, in the state's first attempt at modern government, power was purposely telescoped into one office. ''The governor has the institutional power to make things happen,'' said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia who has written extensively on governorships. ''Everyone is responsible to that one executive, and then the voters know who to credit or blame.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, government by competing officials can be inefficient, if inventive and interesting.</p>
        <p>In New York, even though the governor and lieutenant governor run as a ticket, some lieutenant governors have been famously uncooperative. Lt. Gov. Mary Anne Krupsak, for instance, ran against Gov. Hugh Carey in the primary after his first term. Later, Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross feuded openly with Gov. George Pataki, who removed her police escort and removed her from the ticket for the next election, at which point she left the Republican Party to run against him.</p>
        <p>In Mississippi, Gov. Kirk Fordice went to court to stop the lawsuit that the elected attorney general, Michael Moore, filed against the tobacco companies. The governor, claiming that such a step required his approval, said the suit ''makes me want to throw up.''</p>
        <p>Or in Alabama, when Gov. Fob James Jr. questioned the federal courts' jurisdiction over the states, Attorney General Bill Pryor, a fellow Republican, declared that the governor's views ''do not state the legal position of the State of Alabama.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Professor Sabato said he preferred the New Jersey model to those -- like his own, where the governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general are elected independently -- that diffuse power. ''The conflicts that occur between the lower elected officers and the governor are not awe-inspiring or revealing,'' he said. ''They're about petty things.''</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, New Jersey's former  governors like the system here, too.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's predecessor, Jim Florio, while citing the drawback that ''you have no place to hide,'' said that ''our system is wonderful in that you have real, fixed accountability.''</p>
        <p>''You can effectively be the legislative branch because of the veto,'' Mr. Florio said. ''You can go out and mobilize people. The power is a legislative, an executive and a public-opinion-forming authority.''</p>
        <p>Former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne uses the example of the Pinelands -- which, he said, is what he most wants to be remembered for. ''When I decided the Pinelands ought to be saved, I saved them,'' Mr. Byrne said, ''first by telling my commissioner not to issue permits. Then I issued an executive order, then finally got a statute passed.''</p>
        <p>''What makes the job fun is you can get something done,'' he added. ''It's a great satisfaction.''</p>
        <p>IN 1993, the job went to Christine Todd Whitman, whose experience in elected office consisted of serving as a Somerset County freeholder. With startling speed, even before she could deliver on her famous promise to cut taxes by 30 percent, she achieved celebrity.</p>
        <p>Polls showed her approval rating jumping as much as 20 percentage points during her first year. In the meantime, the tax cuts inspired copycat efforts around the country.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman was one of People magazine's most intriguing people of the year in 1994, along with Heather Locklear and O. J. Simpson. In 1995 she delivered the Republican response to President Clinton's State of the Union message. Her future in the Republican Party seemed to be checked only by her pro-choice stand on abortion, which turned out to raise her stature with the party's recovering moderate wing.</p>
        <p>But the glow faded with time. Talk of a vice presidential nomination flickered and then died, as it did again this year.</p>
        <p>At home, property taxes were rising, along with Democrats' protests that the Whitman cuts were endangering the state's long-term fiscal health. And even though her party controlled both houses, she was not making friends in the Legislature. Nor has she made many since.</p>
        <p>Even Democrats are guarded in their criticism, and many insist that they find the governor personally likable. But many say she has frozen out the Legislature.</p>
        <p>''Has she ever learned to deal with it?' said the Senate minority leader, Richard E. Codey of Essex County. ''Very rarely does she reach out.''</p>
        <p>''I was in Kean's office all the time,'' Senator Codey said. ''Florio said, 'You guys control the Legislature, come on in.' Kean would pick up the phone and and say, 'I love what you said about so and so.' ''</p>
        <p>And while Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, who plans to run for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, said Mrs. Whitman had made considerable progress on such big issues as auto insurance rates and open-space preservation, he added, ''She came at the Legislature in a different way than I would.''</p>
        <p>''On just about every issue,'' Mr. Collins said, she could have smoothed the way by going to the Legislature earlier.</p>
        <p>When she did not notify the Senate of her first choice for a new State Police superintendant, it was the Republicans who derailed the nomination; Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco chided the administration for ''bungling'' it.</p>
        <p>Senator Wayne Bryant, a Democrat from Camden County, said no one from the administration consulted him or even notified him of the legislation it introduced recently to enable a state takeover of the city government. And when the governor goes to Camden, he said, ''half the time, if she comes at 4 in the afternoon I get called at 9 in the morning, if I get called at all.</p>
        <p>''You start to get the sense that this governer doesn't want you to be involved,'' Mr. Bryant observed.</p>
        <p>Governor Whitman, while not quite acknowledging a diffident posture, said she usually met with Senate and Assembly leaders at the outset of a big legislative initiative and then left the rest to her staff.</p>
        <p>Legislators often rely on her conditional and line-item veto powers by pursuing a project ''because it responds to the needs of their supporters or constituents back home,'' she said, while ''it's the governor's responsibility to keep imposing the broad picture on them.''</p>
        <p>As for her own initiatives, she said: ''It's never troubled me, and I don't know if it's a male-female thing, but I never worry about compromise being a bad thing. Once I put something out there, as long as I get my overall goal, I don't care if all the lines are written exactly the way I want.''</p>
        <p>OF course, many point out that governors and legislatures are natural</p>
        <p>enemies. State Senator William L. Gormley, a Republican from Atlantic County who has fought with Mrs. Whitman -- ''heatedly,'' he added -- on some environmental issues, said: ''I never questioned her intent; she intended to do what was right for New Jersey.'</p>
        <p>He added, ''I've noted an absolute lack of anything you could call prejudice.''</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Leonard Lance, the chairman of the Budget Committee, said Mrs. Whitman's relationship with the Legislature was good -- no worse than Mr. Florio's or Mr. Kean's -- and he commended her tax cuts and initiative to preserve a million acres of open space. ''The proof of the pudding is that what she has requested has been enacted,'' Mr. Lance said.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Lance, a Hunterdon County Republican whose father helped draft the 1947 Constitution, said: ''I would prefer to see slightly greater constitutional power in the branch of government in which I serve. I wouldn't mind seeing one or two other statewide elected officials.''</p>
        <p>As for how Governor Whitman has put her clout to use, opinions divide, understandably, along party lines. Republicans, who appreciated the tax cuts, were generally amenable to her social programs like expanded health insurance for children; Democrats said she had done little beyond happening upon a booming economy and allowing the state's debt burden to escalate.</p>
        <p>''Hers is a traditional Republican approach that doesn't want to do a lot of things,'' Mr. Florio said. ''It's easier to achieve your goals that way. What you've seen, in the last year especially, is the problems associated with too much of a passive approach to government, thinking that it runs by itself, whether it be E-ZPass or auto emissions.''</p>
        <p>The governor, after saying that Mr. Florio ''must be a little envious,'' responded with a long list of accomplishments: tort reform,  health insurance programs for children and working adults, increased education spending and farmland preservation, a new building code to encourage building in the cities.</p>
        <p>She also defended her environmental record in fervent detail, saying of the environmental advocates, ''Sometimes those people don't know when they've won.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, they are probably the governor's most relentless critics -- in part because she has cast herself as an ally. Bill Neil of the New Jersey Audubon Society said the administration's anti-sprawl campaign had not produced significant protection for undeveloped areas because ''it would take a big, heavy political lift to do that for the state, and she avoids making tough choices.''</p>
        <p>''I think it's the mood of the times,'' Mr. Neil added, ''whether it's Clinton or Whitman, to shoot low.''</p>
        <p>The public's judgment has been more favorable than not, although she came within one percentage point of losing re-election in 1997. In the Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll, after overcoming very early voter skepticism she has consistently been ranked ''good'' or ''excellent'' by about 50 percent of respondents.</p>
        <p>The poll's director, Cliff Zukin, said that put Mrs. Whitman well ahead of Mr. Florio and Mr. Byrne, though clearly behind Governor Kean. ''Whitman is liked and Kean was loved,'' Mr. Zukin said. ''When he was governor, people had an emotional attachment that they don't have to Whitman.''</p>
        <p>Being liked -- and having firm control of the state party -- was enough to assure Mrs. Whitman of the nomination for this year's United States Senate race, but last fall she abruptly dropped out of contention.</p>
        <p>Now the conventional speculation places her in a cabinet post or ambassadorship if George W. Bush is elected president. But she maintained that ''I really haven't spent a lot of time focusing on what's next,'' adding that the governor's office is ''not a good place to look for your next job.''</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a tough transition no matter what,'' she said. ''You go to a cabinet and it's the environment, or its commerce. It's just one thing. It's obviously going to be hard to funnel down, to take on a particular issue, or to be, say, in an ambassadorial post where you really don't have any influence over foreign policy at all.</p>
        <p>''So whatever it is,'' she added, ''it's going to be a real change.''</p>
        <p>THE angling for the governorship in 2001 began the moment James E. McGreevey almost defeated Mrs. Whitman in 1997. Until Senator Torricelli elbowed him aside, Mr. McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge and a former state senator, was the Democrat's presumptive nominee. And all the while the two most powerful legislators, Senator DiFrancesco and Assemblyman Collins, were already competing for the Republican nomination.</p>
        <p>Senator Torricelli is bad news for all of them. Given his capacity for rainmaking and revenge, he has realigned loyalties in his party leaders in just two weeks. Mr. McGreevey, on the other hand, is known as an inexhaustible worker but does not inspire fear.</p>
        <p>Unless, of course, he becomes governor.</p>
