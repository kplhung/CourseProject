        <p>WHEN I WAS FIVE I KILLED MYSELF</p>
        <p>By Howard Buten.</p>
        <p>Overlook, $ 23.95.</p>
        <p>Eight-year-old Burt Rembrandt doesn't want to be a kid anymore. But the way he sees it, being an adult doesn't hold much promise either. When he is caught expressing his feelings for a classmate in a manner that some adults find inappropriate, Burt is whisked away to an institution called the Children's Trust Residence Center, where he learns what motivates ''appropriate behavior'': self-consciousness, fear and shame. Howard Buten's gloomy tale of lost childhood met with little success when it was first published in the United States as a young adult novel, under the title ''Burt,'' almost 20 years ago. The book later became a best seller in France. It's hard to know what, exactly, the French found so compelling about this fairly one-dimensional story. Certainly Buten offers some insight into a troubled child's mind (he is a founder of a center that treats autism in young adults, and he performs as a character called Buffo the clown). And occasionally he captures the free-associative randomness of childlike thinking, in which thoughts large and small hold equal weight. (''At breakfast everything is very silence because it is early in the morning. I can hear the clock in the living room. It says tick tock. My mom always has a cup of coffee. She stares at the wall. She zups it.'') But there's a big difference between talking like an 8-year-old and thinking like one. The many grammatical errors, which serve as unsubtle reminders that this is, after all, a child we're dealing with here, are simply lazy shortcuts meant to compensate for the overall tone, which is ultimately too precociously self-aware to be believable.</p>
