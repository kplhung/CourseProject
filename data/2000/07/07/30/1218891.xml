        <p>It was early evening when my guide, Gerry Thomas, and I arrived at Humbug Pool on the Upsalquitch River in New Brunswick. The river was fairly low, low enough for wading. I eased myself over the side of the canoe, not motivated by caution but by a desire to savor my first Atlantic salmon fishing trip in the new century. It was also hot and muggy, a day that courted languor.</p>
        <p>I had already tied on one of my favorite wet flies for salmon, the venerable Blue Charm. I asked Gerry where he wanted me to start, a ritualistic query because over the years we have fished Humbug many times together. Then I waded halfway across the river, enjoying the pressure of the cool water, 64 degrees, against my legs. I had worked out about 70 feet of line when Gerry said, ''That's far enough, Nelson.''</p>

        <p>It was early evening when my guide, Gerry Thomas, and I arrived at Humbug Pool on the Upsalquitch River in New Brunswick. The river was fairly low, low enough for wading. I eased myself over the side of the canoe, not motivated by caution but by a desire to savor my first Atlantic salmon fishing trip in the new century. It was also hot and muggy, a day that courted languor.</p>
        <p>I had already tied on one of my favorite wet flies for salmon, the venerable Blue Charm. I asked Gerry where he wanted me to start, a ritualistic query because over the years we have fished Humbug many times together. Then I waded halfway across the river, enjoying the pressure of the cool water, 64 degrees, against my legs. I had worked out about 70 feet of line when Gerry said, ''That's far enough, Nelson.''</p>
        <p>Moving downstream three or four feet after every cast, I was soon rewarded with a solid hit. The take had been invisible, no flash of a silver side, no burst of spray. The spray came later as the grilse -- a precocious salmon, usually a male, that returns to its natal stream after only one year at sea -- hurled itself into the air three times as it surged up and down the pool.</p>
        <p>I am always surprised anew at the strength of a fish that usually weighs no more than five pounds and startled by its throbbing energy when I remove the fly from its jaw. We set it free.</p>
        <p>Deep shadows covered most of the pool when I resumed fishing with the Blue Charm, and I soon caught another grilse, which was also released. In happier days, I would have kept both grilse, but the Atlantic salmon is in trouble and one hesitates to diminish its numbers. New Brunswick's current limits for the species allow an angler to kill two grilse a day. The larger salmon, those that have spent more than one year in the Atlantic, must be released.</p>
        <p>Back at our base at Two Brook camp, I discovered that my fishing companion Peter Maas, who had gone downriver with the camp manager and guide, Lee Marshall, had already returned. He was settled in his favorite Two Brook armchair, drink in hand and looking fulfilled, perhaps even gleeful. ''Two hits, two grilse,'' I said. ''How about you?''</p>
        <p>He rattled the ice in his glass and responded nonchalantly, ''Four grilse.''</p>
        <p>I congratulated him. I was sincere, but also slightly irked. We both write for a living, but my realm is hunting and fishing, and his books probe other thickets and other waters. Not discounting his uncanny knack for being in the right place at the right time, I should have at least a slight edge when salmon are the quarry. On our previous visit to Two Brook, he had come behind me, fishing pools where I had struck out a few hours before, catching salmon and grilse with disconcerting consistency.</p>
        <p>I have never liked angling competitions, but Peter and I have somehow become engaged in an informal and ongoing salmon fishing contest.</p>
        <p>We were at Two Brook as the guests of Joseph Cullman 3rd of Manhattan. Cullman and his other guests -- Marian Heiskell and Murray Bring of Manhattan and Joan Wulff of Lew Beach, N.Y. -- were at Cullman's Runnymeade Lodge on the Restigouche River, into which the Upsalquitch flows.</p>
        <p>Peter and I were back on the Upsalquitch early the following morning. On our way upriver, Gerry Thomas and I passed a single hen merganser with 21 ducklings, about double the normal brood for one hen. She was at the rear of the frantic flotilla, which was swimming and half-flying ahead of her.</p>
        <p>We found a pool with several grilse in it and in less than an hour I had hooked four of them, losing two and landing two, all save one on the Blue Charm. That one, which I kept, had made three passes at the Blue Charm, missing it each time, so I switched to a dry, a Gray Wulff, and he was mine.</p>
        <p>Peter caught one grilse that morning. We made the hour's drive to Runnymeade at midday to have lunch with the others. There we learned that everyone had taken fish, whether salmon or grilse, either on Runnymeade waters or on two stretches -- Main Pool and Matapedia Run on the Restigouche -- controlled by the Ristigouche Salmon Club. Marian Heiskell was ecstatic, having hooked and landed two salmon at the Matapedia Run. As we lingered at our meal, dark clouds piled up over the broad valley, bringing rain, torrential at times, that lasted about an hour.</p>
        <p>Later in the day, Peter and I drove to the Ristigouche Salmon Club and the others of our party went to Two Brook. An ever-attentive host, Cullman wanted each of us to have a shot at all the available water.</p>
        <p>When Maas and I reached the highway bridge over the Restigouche between New Brunswick and Matapedia, Quebec, I saw a long, wide, brown stain, runoff from the storm, covering most of the area we were to fish. Fishing for salmon in dirty water is usually a worthless endeavor, and had I been alone I would have returned to Runnymeade, and an afternoon's reading.</p>
        <p>We flailed the water until dark and the only fish we caught or saw was a grilse that I took in the last half hour on a huge, ugly, dirty-water wet fly, a cross between a Mickey Finn and an Edson Tiger. The water was still somewhat discolored when we returned the following morning and it was Peter's turn to catch the only fish, a good-sized grilse.</p>
        <p>Cool weather moved in. Peter and I went back to Two Brook that afternoon, and along with Joan Wulff, who loves the remote and intimate Upsalquitch, we had some first-rate fishing that night and the next day, our last. On the final morning I caught two grilse and returned to camp to find Peter in the chair with an ice pack on his swollen right knee. It had given way while he was wading Caribou Pool. He had gone down facing upstream with water pouring into his waders and was extricated from that position by his guide, John Marshall.</p>
        <p>That evening, fishing different pools, Joan Wulff and I had fun with both grilse and salmon that repeatedly slashed at our dry flies, but didn't connect. Each of us muffed one good chance; Joan's opportunity came while fishing a deer-hair mouse. Her attention was diverted for an instant, the instant in which a good-sized salmon engulfed the mouse, then rejected it. My opportunity came when a nice grilse took my Royal Wulff, then spit it out before I was able to tighten the line. My only excuse is that having floated that fly over the same grilse more than 20 times, my attention had flagged.</p>
        <p>Peter had gamely limped back into the river that afternoon, catching one grilse for a total of seven for the trip, one shy of my effort.</p>
        <p>Rattling the ice in his drink that night, he said to me, ''You're top rod.''</p>
        <p>He might have added ''this time,'' but he didn't.</p>
