        <p>The front office lacks a carpet and the ceiling paint is still dimpled, but most of the damage to the Bloomingdale School of Music has been mended after a boiler problem caused a major flood in January.</p>
        <p>The school is now engaged in a small-scale fund-raising effort to make up its insurance deductibles and the costs of asbestos removal connected with the flood, a total of $4,600. The checks are trickling in at $15 and $20 apiece, unlike the gush of water that signified how a mishap at a small institution can become a large headache.</p>
        <p>So far, only $1,000 has been raised, despite a witty letter from the executive director, Lawrence Davis, who once conducted a fund-raising concert titled ''Music for Multiple Bad Pianos.''</p>
        <p>But the important thing is that an extraordinary run of bad luck has ended at the school, which for 36 years has taught music to thousands of children of all races and income levels and brings together local amateurs in a chamber orchestra. It also offers Upper West Siders chamber music concerts in their backyard.</p>
        <p>The bad luck started on Jan. 17. A group came in to rehearse. It was freezing. So one of the musicians called the custodian, Luis Oviedo, who found the old boiler running white-hot, the heating pipes frozen. A valve had failed to send water for the boiler to heat into steam. Wire insulation was on the point of melting, and Mr. Oviedo quickly shut down the boiler.</p>
        <p>''He saved us,'' Mr. Davis said. ''We were just that far from the building burning down.</p>
        <p>A new boiler was installed. Seven days later, the same valve failed, during the night, again when no one was at the school. This time the opposite happened. Water poured uncontrollably through the pipes, sending geysers through the radiators of the 99-year-old town house on 108th Street, between Broadway and Riverside Drive.</p>
        <p>The parlor-floor foyer, second-floor landing, library, front office, faculty lounge and recital hall suffered damage. And a $15,000 harpsichord was destroyed by falling plaster and a deluge of water.</p>
        <p>Insurance early on covered most of the damage, which Mr. Davis estimated at $39,000. The big question mark was the harpsichord. The maker is out of business, but Mr. Davis tracked down a former representative of the company, who came up with the $15,000 estimate. Mr. Davis submitted the claim in April to Traveler's Property and Casualty. On Thursday, after some head-scratching over the unusual claim, the company finally came through, settling for $12,000.</p>
        <p>''We were very pleased with the result,'' Mr. Davis said.</p>
