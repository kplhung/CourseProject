        <p>IT sounded like an epitaph for a venerated principle of economics, one that the Federal Reserve still invokes as a justification for slowing the economy.</p>
        <p>The epitaph, in fact, came from the Fed, from Alan Greenspan himself in his latest round of Congressional testimony. The principle he declared inoperative maintains that full employment and low inflation are incompatible. That may once have been true, but the old connections are not evident now. And Mr. Greenspan's epitaph makes the Fed's next interest rate increase harder to justify.</p>
        <p>The principle in question, known by the acronym Nairu, holds that when the unemployment rate falls below a certain level, inflation accelerates. One goal in slowing the economy is to increase unemployment to its ''natural'' level, the one at which the inflation rate neither rises nor falls. Equilibrium is a holy grail in mainstream economics.</p>
        <p>Raising unemployment is not a pretty thing to do, particularly if people are being asked, or forced, to sacrifice their jobs in the name of a malfunctioning thesis. Mr. Greenspan had been publicly skeptical for months about Nairu, but in reply to a question from Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida -- ''Do we need to move the unemployment rate back higher than 4 percent to achieve price stability?'' -- the Fed chairman seemed to push Nairu into the bygone.</p>
        <p>''My forecast,'' he said, ''is that Nairu, which served as a very useful statistical procedure to evaluate how the economy was behaving, over a number of years, like so many types of temporary models which worked, is probably going to fail in the years ahead as a useful indicator.''</p>
        <p>Hearing this, Senator Paul Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, asked sarcastically if Mr. Greenspan's fellow policy makers at the Fed would see a transcript of the chairman's epitaph. That was a jab at Lawrence H. Meyer, an influential Fed governor who embraces Nairu, which he puts at 5 to 5.25 percent. The Fed has already raised interest rates six times in 14 months to slow the economy, but Mr. Meyer would slow it more if unemployment fails to climb from its present 4 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan's epitaph seems disingenuous. While burying Nairu, he embraces almost the same principle in a different incarnation. He speaks of running out of enough people to take jobs. Labor shortages would then give workers leverage to bargain for higher wages. Companies would raise prices to pay for the higher wages. Or, as Mr. Greenspan told Congress, ''labor costs eventually would have to accelerate to levels threatening price stability.''</p>
        <p>That is Nairu, or lip service to Mr. Meyer's insistence that Nairu lives. For Mr. Greenspan, though, the natural unemployment rate appears to be 4 percent or so. The difference between Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Meyer is an additional 1.4 million people out of work, maybe more. For them, the debate over Nairu matters.</p>
        <p>NAIRU, or the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, is really a description, through equations, of a set of conditions that link unemployment to inflation. Those conditions seemed a lot clearer in 1967, when Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate, first described a natural rate of unemployment and mentioned the numerous factors, even states of mind, that must be ''embedded'' in the equations. In the 50's and early 60's, the math worked.</p>
        <p>A low unemployment rate signaled a robust demand for goods and services. Encouraged by this, the United Auto Workers, for example, negotiated a wage increase with General Motors, and that increase became a pattern for other auto workers and for millions of employees in many industries. Employers, as a matter of course, raised prices to help pay for the higher wages. Demand made the price increases stick; today's flood of quick-to-discount competitors was not yet on the scene.</p>
        <p>Since 1995, demand has been similarly robust, but raising prices is not as easy. Wages have risen in response to low unemployment, but not very much. The old Nairu links from unemployment through wages to inflation have not kicked in. All sorts of reasons are cited: rising productivity, falling computer prices, less expensive imports, low-wage immigrants, weak unions, corporate mobility, job insecurity. The list goes on, and the natural rate of unemployment, set at 6.5 percent in the 1980's, has declined today to 5 percent or less.</p>
        <p>Or maybe there is no natural rate above zero. Maybe Nairu no longer works. Certainly Mr. Greenspan's disavowal makes it harder for the Fed to invoke tight labor markets as a reason to slow the economy in anticipation of rising inflation. Now more than ever, the Fed is under pressure to wait for inflation to actually accelerate before it acts.</p>
