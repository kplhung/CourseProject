        <p>'Aspects of Desire'  Yellow House Works of Art, 422 First Street, Greenport. Through Aug. 6. (631) 477-8673.</p>
        <p>Desire is a broad enough term to encompass the works in this show without implying that they are thematically related. If they share any common ground, the seven artists might agree that it is the territory reserved for passionate observers.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most obsessive is Jenny Feder, whose small house-shaped sculptural constructions recall Joseph Cornell's boxes in their introspective union of experience, recollection and imagination.</p>
        <p>Unlike Cornell, however, Ms. Feder hides her structures' interiors, thereby concealing as much as she reveals. Shrines to specific places, like Ireland, Capri and St. Vincent, combine souvenirs to create resting places for memories. Other examples run the gamut from amusing, as when a shack is dubbed the Ritz, to poignant.</p>
        <p>In Elisa Jensen's oils and Richard Orient's watercolors, experience of place becomes a generalized sensory phenomenon.</p>
        <p>More important than actually locating oneself in time and space is the effort of trying to see and trying to feel where one is. Ms. Jensen stimulates perception by obscuring it behind or within veils of shadowy pigment through which distant light often glimmers like a promise of discovery. Mr. Orient uses water, specifically the ambiguous space beneath its surface, as the vehicle for transporting the viewer into a world of sensuous pleasure.</p>
        <p>Geoffrey Leven's manipulated Polaroid photographs examine the body as an object of desire, but only in his large hand-formed paper work, ''Lorelei,'' using a slice of cheesecake as a lure, does he approach the subject in stereotypical terms. The Polaroids, enhanced by waxy overpainting that blurs the details, are deliberately enigmatic, a quality reinforced by a Susan Sontag quotation about androgyny.</p>
        <p>A series of abstract collages by Garance, also accompanied by apt quotations, symbolizes intense emotions in appropriately graphic terms.</p>
        <p>Scrap metal sculptures by Patrick Calkins and Nicke Gorney's muted abstractions seem a bit out of place in this company, although it could be argued that the viewer gives them relevance by desiring them.</p>
        <p>'Fine'  Whitney Art Works, 414 First Street, Greenport. Through Aug. 6. (631) 477-0745.</p>
        <p>Also without a specific theme, this five-artist exhibition is nevertheless unified by a concentration on the regional landscape. Except for Jen Smith, who fashions jewelry as an intimate setting for photographic details divorced from their surroundings, they are painters and photographers whose subject matter is Long Island.</p>
        <p>Barbara Perrino shifts between landscape and still life in velvety platinum/palladium prints, some pieced to give a kaleidoscopic effect, slicing images into segments that recombine as abstractions.</p>
        <p>The painter Edward Joseph also cuts out sections of landscape, forcing the vista into a vertical format.  This contradictory presentation negates the horizon, pulling the eye up toward the sky and down toward the foreground, which is usually water.  Land tends to appear as a brief but significant punctuation mark, like a dash between two statements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Joseph's largest work, ''Subdivided Landscape,'' is a seven-canvas composition in which the view is interrupted by regular bars of negative space. Apart from its intriguing visual effect, the painting also has a symbolic dimension, suggesting the carving up that changes land into real estate. The artist often imposes understated commentary on his highly formalized and apparently timeless scenes, and one feels the implication that human impact, while not catastrophic, is an implicit threat.</p>
        <p>Alan Bull takes a more conventional and ideologically neutral approach to landscape, treating buildings and other evidence of human occupation as grist for his pictorial mill. His small oil sketches, and especially his monotypes, are fresh and lively, as are a series of watercolor studies of toy vehicles. His light touch deserts him, however, in ''Fifth Street Beach,'' where inflated scale has transformed sky, water and land into an oppressive blanket of leaden tonality. For an evocative treatment of ephemeral effects, turn instead to Kathy Kennedy's color pinhole photographs of Long Island Sound. Her ''Seascape'' series is rich and poetic.</p>
        <p>Mac Wells/Robin Johnson  Art Sites, 211 East Front Street, Greenport. Through Aug. 13. (631) 477-1424.</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Kennedy, Mr. Wells is inspired by Long Island Sound, but his watercolors are not seascapes in the usual sense. He is more interested in capturing or evoking atmosphere than in depicting specific scenes.</p>
        <p>Indeed, rather than making overt visual statements, his meditatively titled paintings invite contemplation.  ''Nadisa'' and ''Ambupati,'' for example, resemble rain clouds drifting over water, while in ''Lavana,'' the clouds dissipate into mist. ''Injuda'' leads the gaze into the space between lowering fog and becalmed sea.</p>
        <p>The tonal bands that define ''Khapaga'' occupy the positions of sky, sea and land in a typical seascape, but they establish entirely different spatial and conceptual relationships.</p>
        <p>Instead of receding, the water bellies outward. Instead of rising in the foreground, the earth seems to stand on its head, and the sky paradoxically darkens at the horizon.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Wells's observations are as much about color as they are about his ostensible subject matter.  That is even more apparent in his mixed-media paintings done in Maine, where the focus is on geometric structure and chromatic interplay.</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson's ceramics make an appealing contrast to the paintings' translucent tones and smooth textures.</p>
        <p>The eccentric shapes and rough surfaces, usually with embedded grit that gives added visual and tactile interest, resemble natural formations.</p>
        <p>The debt to Asian precedents is evident, but Ms. Johnson's personal touches, like the rows and clusters of pebbles that accent both slab-sided and curving forms, assert her individuality within a well-established pottery tradition.</p>
