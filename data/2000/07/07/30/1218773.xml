        <p>A 12-year legal feud between two brothers over the diamond fortune and business left by their father, Harry Winston, ended Monday with one brother, Ronald, 59, gaining control of the business and the other brother, Bruce, 56, pocketing $54.1 million. The company, Harry Winston Inc., which was founded in 1932, is known for lending gems to Hollywood stars for the Academy Awards. Harry Winston donated the 44.5-carat Hope diamond to the Smithsonian Institution in 1958. The settlement was reached in Surrogate's Court in White Plains with a handshake between the brothers. Judge Albert J. Emanuelli said on Wednesday that he was pleased to have ''brought a family back together again after they were at odds for years.''</p>
