        <p>WHEN Dr. Chukwuma Onyeije and his wife, Nwaozichi, decided to move from the Bronx to the suburbs this spring, they wanted enough land for their son, 4, to roam, so they first looked in the northernmost sections of Westchester.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Onyeije, an obstetrician specializing in high-risk pregnancies at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, said, ''It seemed too far for me to commute quickly to the hospital for a delivery. So we started looking in southern Westchester, but didn't see anything we liked. For what we were looking for, it was too expensive. There wasn't enough land, and the homes were too small.''</p>

        <p>WHEN Dr. Chukwuma Onyeije and his wife, Nwaozichi, decided to move from the Bronx to the suburbs this spring, they wanted enough land for their son, 4, to roam, so they first looked in the northernmost sections of Westchester.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Onyeije, an obstetrician specializing in high-risk pregnancies at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, said, ''It seemed too far for me to commute quickly to the hospital for a delivery. So we started looking in southern Westchester, but didn't see anything we liked. For what we were looking for, it was too expensive. There wasn't enough land, and the homes were too small.''</p>
        <p>In May, they found a new four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath home on slightly less than an acre of land for $489,000 in the  hamlet of Thornwood, in central Westchester, that was the ''ultimate happy medium,'' Dr. Onyeije said. ''I thought this was an extremely good buy compared to what we had been seeing.''</p>
        <p>But along with their home in the Town of Mount Pleasant, Dr. Onyeije said he and his wife, a nurse midwife at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, also fell in love with Thornwood. ''This is a happy community,'' he said. ''We met more people on the street in the last two months than we did in the Bronx in eight years. I can't believe we found such a nice place, such a neighborhood, for the amount we paid. Every day we're always fascinated by the richness of the neighborhood's cultural activities, artistic events and people. Clearly, for the foreseeable future, this a great neighborhood to raise kids.''</p>
        <p>Few residents of Thornwood ever leave the hilly hamlet where stately spruces, willows and maples cast shadows on streets named Poe, Byron, Keats and Whittier. ''A lot of people just move up,'' said Faye Kallina, president of the Century 21 Haviland Realty Corporation in Pleasantville.  She said that the median home price increased in the last year to $395,000 from $325,000.</p>
        <p>Michael DiNardo grew up in neighboring Hawthorne and moved to Thornwood in 1981 with his parents. When Mr. DiNardo, who owns Silvio's Restaurant and Pizzeria in the hamlet, married and began his own family, he bought a home in Thornwood. ''As far as convenience, quality of life and what I could purchase for what I could afford, there really aren't too many towns out there that can compare to Thornwood,'' he said. ''I feel I can really relate to the friendly, outgoing, hard-working people in this town.'' Now that the DiNardos and their three children have outgrown their home, Mr. DiNardo said his wife, Lynne, ''won't consider moving to a new home in any town other than Thornwood.''</p>
        <p>Margaret Guadagno, president of Gains Realty Inc. in Thornwood and White Plains, said the housing market in Thornwood was ''scorching, not just hot, because of its accessibility to the city, comparatively low taxes, recreational opportunities and affordability.''</p>
        <p>But she said customers seeking to buy the handful of bungalows, Cape Cods and older  small colonials in the hamlet in the $235,000-to-$350,000 price range might have to compete with ''a long line of builders waiting to buy a small house, knock it down and build a new one that's double or triple its size.''  Recently, she said, a couple signed an unconditional contract on a 1,100-square-foot, three-bedroom, one-bath colonial on 0.11  acre for $239,500 that needed a lot of renovating.</p>
        <p>FROM there, prices reach $425,000 for three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath split levels, Cape Cods, colonials and ranches, built on a quarter acre, that range  from 1,600 to 2,200 square feet. About 50 newer, larger colonials in the Rolling Hills section of the hamlet that are built on one acre of land or more are priced from $430,000 to $650,000, Ms. Kallina said. The few homes on the market beyond this price range are unusual, like a 1789 farmhouse listed at $725,000.</p>
        <p>Other housing options in the hamlet are the 27 condominium units at Kensico Arms, a converted school, where a two-bedroom unit sells for about $200,000. There are also 51 two- and three-bedroom town houses in the hamlet in two developments, the Crossings and Marble Heights. Their price ranges from $325,000 to $370,000. Rentals are available in the hamlet's few multifamily homes and in the 100 legal accessory apartments in residents' homes. Ms. Guadagno said a two-bedroom apartment rented for $1,200 a month.</p>
        <p>It was more than real estate that lured Kathy Gill-Charest, the controller of Young &amp; Rubicam in Manhattan, and her husband, Daniel, an assistant vice president at Lehman Brothers, to the hamlet in 1998.  ''Thornwood is a smattering of middle-class and hard-working executives who have a more realistic bent to their lives than other places in Westchester,'' Mrs. Gill-Charest said. ''We liked that.''</p>
        <p>The configuration of the 1,800-student Mount Pleasant Central School District also drew their attention. It has a school for  kindergarten and first grade and a separate one for the second through fourth grades. ''I think this is very special,'' Mrs. Gill-Charest said. ''It keeps the staff attuned to the individual developmental needs of young children and guards them in a nurturing and protective environment. They've been able to give my daughter, Michelle, individual attention in the areas she needs it. My son, Michael, used to go to private school before we moved here, and he wasn't as happy there as he is here.''</p>
        <p>Joseph Zambito, the superintendent of the district, which draws students from Thornwood, Hawthorne and parts of Pleasantville and Valhalla, said: ''What helps us stand out from other school districts is the number of support programs we offer to help our students meet the standards. Also, for a small district, we offer a lot.''</p>
        <p>Students at Westlake High School, which received a School of Excellence award from the State Education Department in February, can choose from 12 advanced-placement courses in subjects like statistics, drawing and English literature and composition.</p>
        <p>They can also enroll in a three-year science research program, which earns them 12 college credits from the State University of New York. This year a student in the program won third place in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.</p>
        <p>Ninety-one percent of June's 140 graduates are going on to higher education. Students averaged 517 in verbal and 545 in math on the College Board tests this year, compared with statewide averages of 495 in verbal and 502 in math.</p>
        <p>Eight percent of the students in the district attend private or parochial schools.  Some are enrolled in the Holy Rosary Roman Catholic School, with prekindergarten through the eighth grade, in neighboring Hawthorne, and others in private schools in Westchester and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The hamlet also provides recreational opportunities. The seven-acre James M. Carroll Park has a baseball and softball field and a playground. In the winter, when the park's fishing pond freezes, residents can skate. There are also four tennis courts at the high school. But the jewel of the hamlet's recreational offerings is the Mount Pleasant Town Pool, which opened in July 1996. Fees for the four-pool complex are $425 per family this year.</p>
        <p>THE 12 1/2 acres of land that the pools and a community center are built on  were donated to the town by I.B.M. in 1994 and have been a source of revenue, said Robert F. Meehan, town supervisor. The plot was part of a 260-acre site that once held an I.B.M. conference center. The remaining 247 1/2 acres of land were sold to the Legion of Christ, a Roman Catholic order of priests. The order is now seeking a tax exemption for the property, and the matter is in the courts, Mr. Meehan said.</p>
        <p>Tenant farmers sowed the land of Thornwood after Frederick Philipse bought it from the Weskquaesgeek Indians in 1684. In 1695, the area was known as Nanequeeken. It was renamed Nanny Hagen in 1778. After Frederick Philipse III, an heir with Loyalist leanings, fled the country and was forced to forfeit his property to the government, the confiscated estates were sold to the farmers, said George Waterbury, president of the Mount Pleasant Historical Society. In 1846, the New York &amp; Harlem Railroad came through the hamlet, bringing more settlers.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1860's, the area was still occupied by several dairy and general farms, but soon jobs and housing in the hamlet became more plentiful.</p>
        <p>A high grade of marble was discovered in the hamlet, and in 1867, 200 men began working at the quarry where the Thornwood Town Center now stands. The marble was used in many buildings, including St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, Mr. Waterbury said. In the 1880's, Lewis Smabeck, a real estate speculator, bought several farms in the area and created a housing development known as Sherman Park.</p>
        <p>By the turn of the century, development of the hamlet had increased. In quick succession, a firehouse, schoolhouse and post office were erected.</p>
        <p>In 1908, the hamlet changed its named to Hillside, and in 1914, it became Thornwood.  Though several developers continued to build up the hamlet after World War II, some of the farmhouses on Nanny Hagen Road, Eaton Road and Rolling Hills Road still remain.</p>
        <p>Next month, Mara Mills, the artistic director at the Newman Theater of the Rosenthal Y.M.-Y.W.H.A. in Pleasantville, and her husband, James Dirlam, sales manager at Klausner Plumbing Supply in Yonkers, along with the youngest of their three children, will move across the street to an original orchard house, the main house in an apple orchard, in the hamlet.</p>
        <p>''It's a kind of a rush of nostalgic times,'' Ms. Mills said. She is moving to the home her parents just vacated after 26 years.</p>
