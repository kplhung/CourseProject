        <p>SOME dates to remember:</p>
        <p>* July 17. After a seven-week, 35 percent surge from its low for the year, the Nasdaq composite reaches 4,274.67, its highest close since early April.</p>
        <p>* July 18. Unisys, the information technology company, says third-quarter profits will be only about half of what analysts had forecast.</p>
        <p>* July 20. The telecommunications equipment makers Lucent Technologies and Ericsson each warn that third-quarter earnings will fall below expectations.</p>
        <p>* July 26. Xerox, the copier company, says earnings for the second half will fall short.</p>
        <p>* July 27. WorldCom, the long-distance and wireless company, says revenues for the remainder of the year will come in at the low end of current forecasts.</p>
        <p>* July 28. The Nasdaq is down 14.3 percent since July 17.</p>
        <p>So even as second-quarter earnings reports are coming in stronger than expected, especially for technology companies, investors seem suddenly to be focusing on the possibility of a slowdown in earnings growth during the rest of the year. It's about time.</p>
        <p>Talk of slower earnings growth has been bubbling for a while. Quarterly forecasts by First Call/Thomson Financial and I.B.E.S. International, which collect Wall Street profit estimates for the companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, have been tailing off. But investors, intoxicated by the unbelievable earnings growth this decade and particularly over the last year, seemed to ignore the warnings until now.</p>
        <p>If you remain unconvinced, here is something to think about: Optimism about earnings may itself be a negative sign.</p>
        <p>The analysts who forecast earnings are still upbeat about the rest of the year, even with the Federal Reserve trying to slow economic growth to curb inflation. S.&amp; P. 500 operating earnings are expected to have grown by 20.6 percent in the second quarter, to grow 16.6 percent in the third quarter and an additional 14.5 percent in the fourth, according to I.B.E.S. First Call's forecasts for each period are a tad higher. For the year, I.B.E.S. sees 18.5 percent growth, First Call sees 19.6 percent; either way, one of the best years since 1990.</p>
        <p>Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call, noted that earnings forecasts are holding up even for some economically sensitive sectors despite higher interest rates. Companies in home construction are expected to show a 13 percent decline in earnings in the second quarter, compared with the period a year ago, and then close the gap to 3 percent in the third quarter and post 6 percent growth in the fourth. Companies in the automobile sector are expected to show 14 percent growth in the third quarter and 15 percent in the fourth quarter. These are not the numbers one would expect, Mr. Hill said, if the economy were slowing down the way Federal Reserve policy makers would like.</p>
        <p>THAT optimism indicates that Wall Street analysts do not expect a significant slowdown in growth in the second half -- not unreasonable, given that the economy has stuttered in the second quarter in past years only to reaccelerate in the fall.</p>
        <p>But Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, reminded investors in testimony to Congress last week that when policy makers meet on Aug. 22, the decision on another interest rate hike will depend on new economic data for July showing that the slowing trend he has identified is continuing.</p>
        <p>That means one of two things: Wall Street analysts are wrong -- the economy really will slow significantly, and so will corporate earnings, to investors' intense disappointment. Or, the analysts are right -- the Fed's rate increases haven't worked yet and the economy is perking up again.</p>
        <p>Right now the data favors the analysts, including the totally unexpected 5.2 percent jump in second-quarter gross domestic product reported on Friday, the increases in durable-goods orders and existing home sales in June and the rising consumer confidence this month.</p>
        <p>If the trend holds, the Fed is likely to push rates higher still. And that won't be good for stocks. So beware. Earnings may be bad for the stock market's health.</p>
