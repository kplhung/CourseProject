        <p>TWO brothers, William and Edward Baker, have been builders for more than 30 years, but a dispute with the neighbors of a new subdivision has threatened to put them out of business and could force them to tear down four new houses.</p>
        <p>''We grew up around here, and I was that lady's paper boy,'' William Baker said last week, pointing to one of the older homes in the neighborhood. ''Why are the neighbors turning against us now? These are nice houses that we've built, in keeping with the neighborhood, and we've crossed our t's and dotted our i's every step of the way. What did we do wrong?''</p>
        <p>At its core, the dispute is about the fate of former state park land, which has shielded the neighbors from views of high-tension wires and a nearby parkway. The Bakers, who bought the former state property at below-market prices, say they simply want to turn a profit.</p>
        <p>In a ruling this month in State Supreme Court in White Plains, Justice Peter M. Leavitt said that the building permits issued to the Bakers were invalid because they were based on a 70-year-old subdivision plan. That plan allowed builders to combine adjacent lots to meet current zoning codes -- as is common in many localities -- without seeking zoning approval.</p>
        <p>The judge sided with the neighborhood group that filed the suit -- the Orchard Hill Civic Association -- and ordered the Bakers to seek site-plan approval for their project from the Greenburgh Planning Board. Under the ruling, if the builders cannot obtain the proper building permits by Jan. 8, the new houses might have to be torn down.</p>
        <p>The neighbors look across Kathwood Road at four new houses and three other building lots and mourn the loss of trees that once protected their views.</p>
        <p>''This is not a personal thing against the Bakers,'' said Harold Westerman, a retired school principal, who lives in the neighborhood. ''It's the noise from the parkway and the stench of oil that bothers us.''</p>
        <p>Concerned about the implications of Justice Leavitt's ruling, the town entered the fray. It filed a motion to make legal all combined lots that already have houses on them, so the houses can be added on to or sold, for example, without requiring subdivision approval, said Edward M. Lieberman, Greenburgh's deputy town attorney.</p>
        <p>He explained that most municipalities in Westchester, as elsewhere, were originally laid out in 25-by-100-foot lots. When zoning was adopted -- in the late 1920's in Greenburgh -- the law required larger lot sizes, and as a result, property owners often combined adjacent lots when they were ready to build. ''But now the decision of the court makes these lots and all other similar lots in town illegal, and we're talking about hundreds if not thousands of such lots,'' Mr. Lieberman said.</p>
        <p>''What the town does not want is to have innocent owners of pre-existing homes harmed by what was an unexpectedly broadly worded decision by the court. We want the court to limit its decision to this and future applications.''</p>
        <p>The lawyer for the builders, Stanley S. Zinner, similarly sees a threat to homeowners throughout the county. ''The concept of merging lots is customary all over,'' he said. ''This case has far-reaching implications.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Zinner added that he fears it will be impossible for the Bakers, who he said ''have put their life savings into this,'' to win zoning approval by the judge's deadline.</p>
        <p>''This all can't be done in a few months,'' said the lawyer, who is appealing the judge's decision. ''It's like telling them you have a week to build the Empire State Building. And what did my clients do wrong? Nothing!''</p>
        <p>Some neighbors, however, think the Bakers did quite a bit wrong. They say the pair knew residents in nearby houses opposed construction on the former state park land and were going to mount a legal challenge. Still, they say, the Bakers sought a delay of a meeting of the Planning Board, dragged their feet on a number of matters and all the while proceeded with construction.</p>
        <p>Thomas J. Abinanti, a county legislator and a neighbor, who is representing the Orchard Hill Civic Association on a pro-bono basis, called the Bakers ''sharp characters'' who went ahead while knowing that a full-scale legal battle was being mounted against them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, the town's counsel, agreed that the Bakers continued with construction ''at their own risk because neighbors have been working on this issue for a while.'' But the Bakers denied ignoring neighbors' concerns, saying they have met with members of the civic association and tried to make concessions -- to no avail. They said that in one instance they gave away part of their property to a neighbor so she could have a bigger yard. And they said they've carefully mixed the styles of the houses to keep the project from looking like a tract. As for neighbors' claims that they ruined former park land, they said it was ''a littered dump site'' with scrub trees on it before construction began.</p>
        <p>To end the conflict, neighbors said they would consider an out-of-court agreement with the builders.</p>
        <p>Dominick Angiolillo Jr., a kitchen and tile contractor and a resident, said the association wants fewer than the seven planned homes, replacement of trees and noise barriers.</p>
