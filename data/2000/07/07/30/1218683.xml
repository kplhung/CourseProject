        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I joyously read Pat Metheny's diatribe on Kenny G while on break from playing jazz at a hotel in Philly [''Jazz Can Take Itself Too Seriously'' by Ben Ratliff, July 16]. After grinding out some blues for Jimmy Buffett and his dancers as they relaxed after their concert, I huddled with some members of his band relishing every morsel of what Mr. Metheny had to say about judging Kenny G by jazz standards, and about critics' seeming to have a curious lack of outrage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ratliff transparently avoids this salient point by saying that Kenny G, Louis Armstrong and Pat Metheny all belong to ''pop culture'' and that pop culture is about advertising, not music. By conflating these three vastly different musicians, Mr. Ratliff offers them all up for mindless consumption, equalizing them in a soup of arrogant haphazardness, stripping them of their meaning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ratliff rightly calls Armstrong a generous genius and then trots out that old-sell-out-''Hello Dolly'' stuff, writing that Armstrong's ''What a Wonderful World'' is ''a big, dewy Barney smile.'' He obscures the fact that Kenny G will be a footnote, if that, in the book of 20th-century American music, a book Armstrong started writing when he left for Chicago. What Mr. Metheny was trying to say was that if folks call Kenny G a jazz musician (and a great percentage do), he should be critiqued as one.</p>
