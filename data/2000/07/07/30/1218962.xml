        <p>I don't know how many times I've hunkered down with a hoagie at some small roadside joint and thought, ''I wonder what they've got for dessert.'' Often I'm left weeping into my fries, because the heartless rules of take-out commerce demand grab-and-run fare. The folks behind the counter act as if no one, least of all them, has time for sweets, except perhaps week-old bagged cookies or slabs of pound cake. But this is never a problem at Gronsky's. Shed a tear and the teenage waitress has every right to rap your noggin as she quips, ''Uh, hello? This is the Milk House, remember?''</p>

        <p>I don't know how many times I've hunkered down with a hoagie at some small roadside joint and thought, ''I wonder what they've got for dessert.'' Often I'm left weeping into my fries, because the heartless rules of take-out commerce demand grab-and-run fare. The folks behind the counter act as if no one, least of all them, has time for sweets, except perhaps week-old bagged cookies or slabs of pound cake. But this is never a problem at Gronsky's. Shed a tear and the teenage waitress has every right to rap your noggin as she quips, ''Uh, hello? This is the Milk House, remember?''</p>
        <p>In the unlikely event that you would forget, cow-bedecked walls and black-and-white checkerboard floors in this spotless restaurant hammer home a relentless dairy theme. Thanks to this barrage, as you sit noshing, your appetite is forever skipping merrily ahead to your date with some sweet, icy, milk-based product.</p>
        <p>Yes, you can buy milk at the Milk House. Most people pop in for a newspaper or a Coke, then hang around for a plate of tender clam strips or salty crinkle-cut fries, not to mention hoagies, burgers, dogs, pork rolls with cheese, and a variety of salads and ''lite'' fare. Save room for a sugar cone crammed with your choice of 24 flavors of hard ice cream. Or soft-serve. Or frozen yogurt. Or, if you must, sugar-free hard ice cream. The Milk House stocks Welsh Farms in take-home pints and half-gallons too,as any Jersey Milk House should. You'll love the prices: a large ice cream sundae is $2.45.</p>
        <p>Behind the Milk House, picnic tables squat by the local river, the south branch of the Raritan. On warm summer days, there's no finer pleasure than putting the final lick on a cone as the waters rush by and fat mallards dive for their meals. If the tables are taken, perch on the old log. Ice cream by a river? Thank you, Mr. Gronsky, whoever you are.</p>
        <p>JOSEPH D'AGNESE</p>
        <p>Gronsky's Milk House, 125 West Main Street, High Bridge. (908) 638-6030.</p>
