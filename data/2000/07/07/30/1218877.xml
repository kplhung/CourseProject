        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It was with much interest that I read the commentary regarding Peter Applebome's gas station dilemma [July 16].</p>
        <p>Rude and discourteous behavior that goes unchallenged is behavior that goes unchanged. We have all been faced with such dilemmas, but far too many of us accept the status quo and avoid becoming involved because that is the easier thing to do. Confrontation for most of us is understandably unpleasant and easily avoidable if we choose to ignore it. Does that make it right? I don't think so.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It was with much interest that I read the commentary regarding Peter Applebome's gas station dilemma [July 16].</p>
        <p>Rude and discourteous behavior that goes unchallenged is behavior that goes unchanged. We have all been faced with such dilemmas, but far too many of us accept the status quo and avoid becoming involved because that is the easier thing to do. Confrontation for most of us is understandably unpleasant and easily avoidable if we choose to ignore it. Does that make it right? I don't think so.</p>
        <p>To illustrate the point, not long ago I was driving down the Bronx River Parkway, near the County Center, when the passenger in the car in front of me discarded a full cup of coffee out the window. I was incensed and, as luck would have it, we both made the turn in front of the County Center and were stopped alongside each other at the light.</p>
        <p>After momentary debate in my mind, I lowered my window and, as politely as my anger would allow, asked why my environment had been littered. At that point, the passenger, who I might add was a Hispanic male, got out of the car and approached me. With my heart palpitating in anticipation of violence, and wondering why I had opened my big mouth, I raised my window and checked my door locks. The man motioned for me to lower my window, which I guardedly did, whereupon he politely and sincerely apologized to me for what he had done.</p>
        <p>Is there a lesson here? I think the answer is obvious. That man will think twice before he litters again, and I have the satisfaction of knowing that in some small way, by challenging that behavior, I helped to change it. In this society containing so much rage, can it be dangerous to confront another's behavior? The answer is certainly yes, but I guess we all have to make our own decisions and do what we feel is right.</p>
