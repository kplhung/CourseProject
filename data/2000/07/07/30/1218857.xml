        <p>Editorial contends George W Bush's acceptance speech at Republican National Convention will signal whether he puts his stamp on party, or party's right wing draws hard-edged, highly ideological template for his candidacy</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The accepted wisdom nowadays is that the national political conventions are little more than expensive relics, and it is true that the major events of the Republican jamboree that begins tomorrow in Philadelphia are largely foreordained. Gov. George W. Bush's nomination is secure, his vice president chosen. Yet this is a supremely important and surprisingly suspenseful time for Mr. Bush. The image of the man who promised a future based on ''compassionate conservatism'' is murkier than it was a few weeks ago, as is the very meaning of his trademark term. The Philadelphia convention will be an exercise in political packaging whose decisive moments will be Mr. Bush's acceptance speech, the final drafting of the G.O.P. platform, and Richard  Cheney's reintroduction to the national audience. All these, in turn, will determine whether Mr. Bush puts his stamp on the Republican Party or the party's right wing draws a hard-edged, highly ideological template for his candidacy.</p>
        <p>In short, the political world will be watching to see if Mr. Bush can pull his campaign back to the moderate middle from which he governed in Texas. Clearly, Mr. Cheney's selection did more to muddle Mr. Bush's message than he ever expected, even though he insists he was not ''blindsided'' by the auto-pilot conservatism of Mr. Cheney's voting record in Congress. ''I'm a conservative, too,'' Mr. Bush said, but it is hard to believe that the governor's conservatism would have encompassed Mr. Cheney's votes against Head Start and the equal rights amendment, his hard-line stance on every gun control measure that came his way, or his opposition to a resolution in 1986 that called on South Africa to release Nelson Mandela from prison.</p>

        <p>The accepted wisdom nowadays is that the national political conventions are little more than expensive relics, and it is true that the major events of the Republican jamboree that begins tomorrow in Philadelphia are largely foreordained.

        <p>In short, the political world will be watching to see if Mr. Bush can pull his campaign back to the moderate middle from which he governed in Texas. Clearly, Mr. Cheney's selection did more to muddle Mr. Bush's message than he ever expected, even though he insists he was not ''blindsided'' by the auto-pilot conservatism of Mr. Cheney's voting record in Congress. ''I'm a conservative, too,'' Mr. Bush said, but it is hard to believe that the governor's conservatism would have encompassed Mr. Cheney's votes against Head Start and the equal rights amendment, his hard-line stance on every gun control measure that came his way, or his opposition to a resolution in 1986 that called on South Africa to release Nelson Mandela from prison.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush wishes to persuade voters that his G.O.P. will not resurrect the inflexible attitudes and stark policies of the Gingrich era, he must dominate the convention stage. That is still a big stage, despite the decision by the main broadcast networks to limit their coverage to one hour in prime time. There will be a huge audience in those peak periods and a continuing audience of great sophistication for the other media to which the networks are passing the torch of political communications -- cable, C-Span, the 24-hour news shows and the Internet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush must use his acceptance speech to reassert his control of his candidacy and establish his primacy within the party. Nobody knows this better than he does. His father used his brilliantly conceived ''kinder, gentler nation'' speech in New Orleans in 1988 to establish his independence and to distance himself from the social callousness of Reaganism. Not coincidentally, the speech helped give him a lead over Michael Dukakis that he never relinquished. Four years later, the same George Bush damaged himself badly with a pallid speech that left him looking like a helpless bystander as Pat Buchanan hijacked the party's philosophical bank account with his scary rant about cultural warfare.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush cannot afford to look like a bystander at his convention. He needs a speech proving that his vision rather than Mr. Cheney's crabbed ideology will define Republican ideals. Another place where Mr. Bush can put his brand on the party is the platform. A draft released last week showed some movement away from the sheer venom of the 1996 platform. But the new document offered no evidence of any sustained effort or desire by Mr. Bush to move his party to more sensible ground on two key issues. He left in place a harsh abortion plank, even though he uses a more conciliatory tone in speeches. On gun control, the platform repeats the proven formula for failure through stronger enforcement of existing laws.</p>
        <p>At a time when conventions no longer decide nominations, they still provide a testing place where candidacies can either soar or flop. In the primaries, Mr. Bush showed that he could take a punch from a strong opponent. In Philadelphia, he will have his chance to show that he can stand up to his party's fiercest factions and sketch a picture of America that will attract, rather than frighten, middle-of-the-road voters.</p>
