        <p>EVERYONE knows about empty-nest syndrome. Suddenly, it seems, the last child is off to college. All the noise, the mess, the phone ringing and, of course, the endless worry is replaced by an eerie quiet, a disarmingly neat house and the understanding that, like it or not, the child is out of your hands.</p>
        <p>What I hadn't counted on was a sneak preview of this stage of life. It has come unexpectedly in the form of having both of my children away at sleep-away camp. For the first time in more than 15 years, I do not have a child in the house. It's sort of like a dress rehearsal for the real thing.</p>

        <p>EVERYONE knows about empty-nest syndrome. Suddenly, it seems, the last child is off to college. All the noise, the mess, the phone ringing and, of course, the endless worry is replaced by an eerie quiet, a disarmingly neat house and the understanding that, like it or not, the child is out of your hands.</p>
        <p>What I hadn't counted on was a sneak preview of this stage of life. It has come unexpectedly in the form of having both of my children away at sleep-away camp. For the first time in more than 15 years, I do not have a child in the house. It's sort of like a dress rehearsal for the real thing.</p>
        <p>And here is my guilty little secret -- I'm enjoying it. What I can't tell, though, is whether this pleasure is based on the fact that I know our separation is temporary, only seven weeks, or a sign that when the time comes, I will truly be ready.</p>
        <p>Here comes the obligatory caveat: I love my children. I enjoy them immensely. My daughter, 15, is full of energy and exuberance, sings in the shower, talks rapidly and incessantly, has loads of friends and ever so often can be persuaded to study for an exam or pick up a wet towel. My 11-year-old son is one of the nicest people I know -- he wouldn't think of wandering into the kitchen for a snack without asking if he could bring you something. He is mad for sports, and when he is not playing them, he is watching them on ESPN.</p>
        <p>The first few days after they left, I could barely look into their rooms in the morning, because I would miss too much the sight of my son's lanky body, clad only in boxer shorts, spread eagle on top of his sheets, or my daughter's blonde hair cascading over her pillow. But I look in now, and tell myself that one of these days I'm going to clean out all those old hockey cards or clear out that stack of Seventeen magazines.</p>
        <p>But I haven't even done that. I've cleaned up my own office, taken a more relaxed attitude toward work, spent more time with friends and most of all become reacquainted with my husband. That is, my husband the man I fell in love with, as distinct from my husband, the children's father.</p>
        <p>''This is so much fun,'' we keep saying to each other. We have long, uninterrupted conversations. We dine at home by candlelight. We go for walks after dinner. We go to the movies at the spur of the moment. When the phone rings, it's for one of us. At night we leave the bedroom door open.</p>
        <p>Of course, much of my sense of relaxation and enjoyment is predicated on the fact that the children are having a good time at camp. We hear from them regularly -- the 15-year-old with breathless, stream-of-consciousness reports on her state of mind; the 11-year-old with accounts of his latest activities. He is still young enough to cover the letters with XXX's and OOO's.</p>
        <p>My friends who have experienced real empty-nest syndrome -- actually sent their children off to begin their adult lives -- say that this honeymoon period I'm experiencing is not at all like the real thing. It's like a small child playing dress up -- swaggering around in shoes far too big, a hat that covers the eyes. It's fun because it's pretend, and you can cast off the too big clothes and get back to your old life. My children will soon be home, and in the next blink of an eye we'll be buying school supplies and negotiating over new shoes.</p>
        <p>And I'll remember these halcyon days of not having to drive anyone to soccer practice, or worry about whether there will be drinking at the high school party. Still, I've run into several friends this summer who are packing off their youngest to college. Without exception, they have all gotten puppies. Maybe they're on to something.</p>
