        <p>Arbitrator grants police officers in Suffolk County, Long Island, four-year contract that raises salaries, already among highest in US, by 20 percent; ruling will result in 20 percent hike next year in homeowners' police-district taxes (S)</p>

        <p>An arbitrator decided last week to give Suffolk County police officers a four-year contract that effectively raises their salaries -- already among the highest in the nation -- by 20 percent and will result in a 20 percent increase in homeowners' police-district taxes next year.</p>
        <p>The contract, which is retroactive to the beginning of this year, will increase the base pay of Suffolk County police officers from roughly $70,000 now to more than $84,000 in 2003. Allowances for uniforms, cleaning bills, overtime and special assignments were also increased in the arbitration. County officials estimated that the decision would increase a typical homeowner's $6,000 property tax bill by $133 this year.</p>

        <p>An arbitrator decided last week to give Suffolk County police officers a four-year contract that effectively raises their salaries -- already among the highest in the nation -- by 20 percent and will result in a 20 percent increase in homeowners' police-district taxes next year.</p>
        <p>The contract, which is retroactive to the beginning of this year, will increase the base pay of Suffolk County police officers from roughly $70,000 now to more than $84,000 in 2003. Allowances for uniforms, cleaning bills, overtime and special assignments were also increased in the arbitration. County officials estimated that the decision would increase a typical homeowner's $6,000 property tax bill by $133 this year.</p>
        <p>The contract calls for a 4.6 percent increase this year, followed by a 4.75 percent increase in the second year and 4.5 percent increases in the third and fourth years. The police union had asked for 5.5 percent increases in each of the four years and the county had countered with 2 percent increases.</p>
        <p>The county executive, Robert J. Gaffney, said the award was ''beyond what anybody reasonably expected'' and once again called for a re-evaluation of the state-mandated binding arbitration process for police department contract negotiations. ''It's a process over which the county has no control, but yet we have to pay the bill,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He, along with officials from Nassau County, criticized the process, saying it caused a ''leapfrogging'' effect where the salaries of Suffolk and Nassau officers continue to rise above national averages through a steady flow of arbitration awards.</p>
        <p>But Ron Davis, an attorney for the Suffolk County Police Benevolent Association, said the award was fair and reasonable. ''You have to consider what officers are being paid in surrounding jurisdictions and arbitrators generally don't go far afield,'' he said.</p>
