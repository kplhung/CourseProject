        <p>SCHOOL budgets rarely become the talk of the town. But the impending budget crisis has been Topic A in Yonkers since May, when the former schools superintendent, Dr. Andre J. Hornsby, warned that the gap between what the schools requested -- $353 million -- and what the city was offering -- $327 million -- could force devastating cuts in programs and hundreds of layoffs.</p>
        <p>The crisis coincides with the district's June announcement of gains in student test scores. Unless the district finds a way to fill the gap, those gains could be reversed, said Ellis Cousens, a school board member.</p>

        <p>SCHOOL budgets rarely become the talk of the town. But the impending budget crisis has been Topic A in Yonkers since May, when the former schools superintendent, Dr. Andre J. Hornsby, warned that the gap between what the schools requested -- $353 million -- and what the city was offering -- $327 million -- could force devastating cuts in programs and hundreds of layoffs.</p>
        <p>The crisis coincides with the district's June announcement of gains in student test scores. Unless the district finds a way to fill the gap, those gains could be reversed, said Ellis Cousens, a school board member.</p>
        <p>After Dr. Hornsby accused Mayor John D. Spencer and the City Council of shortchanging the schools, the school board fired him in June, at the mayor's urging. Since then, interim Superintendent Joseph Farmer, a former teacher and principal in the district, has struggled to fill the gap.</p>
        <p>In mid-July he announced that he had shaved the shortfall to $16 million from $26 million by cutting some long-standing programs, like the visual and fine arts program, and some new ones, including an alternative program for troubled children.</p>
        <p>He also borrowed money to pay for $3.8 million in books and equipment.</p>
        <p>Last week Mr. Farmer proposed a state-financed retirement incentive plan, which could save the district several million more, he said. Under the plan, veteran teachers would receive a financial incentive to retire early and would be replaced by new teachers whose salaries would be lower.</p>
        <p>''We are hoping those with the purse strings will revisit their budgets,'' Mr. Farmer said, ''because we have effectively reduced the gap by $16 million.''</p>
        <p>The mayor has asked the Yonkers Federation of Teachers to defer the raise it negotiated last fall. Steve Frey, the president of the 2,200-member federation, said he is considering it. City officials also hope to rectify an inequity in the state's school aid formula, which they say shortchanges Yonkers.</p>
        <p>And the mayor has pressed hard for a settlement of the city's longstanding federal desegregation order, which could help provide a longer-term remedy for the district's financial woes.</p>
        <p>Officials say the shortfall has various causes, including a rise in city spending and the loss of state aid for court-ordered education programs.</p>
