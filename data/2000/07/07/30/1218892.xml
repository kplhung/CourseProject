        <p>A group of workers who were overcome last year by fumes at a chemical weapons plant in Oregon is accusing the Army of covering up leaks of highly toxic nerve agents and mustard gas on the day of the incident.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the workers at the Umatilla Chemical Depot charge that investigators from the Army and Raytheon, a defense contractor, concealed four leaks of sarin and mustard gas that occurred just hours after 34 workers became ill on Sept. 15.</p>
        <p>The lawyers, citing Army documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, also said chemical agents had leaked at the site 22 times during a six-day period, including the day the workers were sickened. The depot is near Hermiston, in eastern Oregon.</p>
        <p>The Army denies that any of the workers stricken at the depot were exposed to leaks from the chemical weapons, although it has failed to identify the specific source of their illness. Inquiries by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the State of Oregon backed up the Army's conclusions.</p>
        <p>''Either the Army and Raytheon have engaged in a deliberate attempt to hide the truth about the Umatilla poisonings or they conducted an investigation that was bungled beyond belief,'' said James E. McCandlish, a lawyer who is representing 18 of the workers. They plan to file a federal lawsuit on Monday against the Army and Washington Group International, Raytheon's parent company.</p>
        <p>The commander of the Umatilla depot, Lt. Col. Tom Woloszyn, said that Mr. McCandlish was misinterpreting the data collected by a highly sensitive system designed to detect the presence of chemical agents. The lawyer is mistaking interferents -- normally occurring chemicals that can cause false readings -- glitches and tests of the system for leaks, Colonel Woloszyn said. And the readings Mr. McClandish is citing are below the levels of accurate detection, the colonel said.</p>
        <p>''We've never had agent detected outside of the igloos themselves,'' he said, referring to the structures that house 3,317 tons of nerve and mustard agent, about 12 percent of the nation's stockpile.</p>
        <p>The stricken workers were building an incinerator to destroy the weapons, as mandated by a 1995 treaty banning chemical arms. Most of the weapons stored at Umatilla were built in the 1960's, including more than 100,000 M55 rockets, and some leak due to corrosion. Since 1984, 127 rockets have been reported leaking.</p>
        <p>The Army insists that the dangerous agents have always been swiftly detected and contained on site. But lawyers for the workers say the open ventilation systems of the storage igloos could allow for toxins to leak into the environment, which is what they assert happened on Sept. 15.</p>
        <p>Two days after the workers were rushed to a local hospital, the Army and Raytheon ruled out exposure to the deadly agents. Three weeks after that, officials at the facility said preliminary tests indicated that fumes from construction materials -- including fiberglass floorboards, paint or wall panels -- were to blame.</p>
        <p>''They have not been able to identify specifically what caused the workers to become ill,'' Mary Alice Binder, a spokeswoman, said on Friday. ''However, we can say it's not the chemical agents stored at the depot.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the workers said the Army and Raytheon investigators had made no mention of rashes and skin irritations found on their clients, which are important indicators of exposure to mustard gas.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCandlish said his clients had since been found to have disorders that include reactive airway disease, which he said causes patients to gag in response to certain fumes or aromas, pulmonary problems and chronic fatigue.</p>
        <p>Washington Group International declined to comment on behalf of Raytheon.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 6, 2000, Sunday  Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about accusations by workers at the Umatilla Chemical Depot in Oregon that the Army had concealed leaks of toxic gases gave a misspelled surname at one point for a lawyer who represents a group of workers. He is James E. McCandlish, not McClandish.</p>
