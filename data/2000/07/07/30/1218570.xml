        <p>I know it's hip to be cynical, but Walter Kirn (The Way We Live Now, July 9) is way too hip for my blood. He seems to take pride in having learned to lie, cheat and steal at his summer job. My summer job -- waiting on tables from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m at a Howard Johnson's -- let me meet ''working stiffs'' delivering bread to the A.&amp;P., alcoholics who stopped in to sober up and salesmen lonely for home. I learned that the difference between blue-collar and blue blood had nothing to do with heart or with the size of my tip. I learned that all jobs have their mundane tasks that must be endured as well as moments of joy. Defending my dissertation was a breeze; I'd explained my topic to customers for years. I waited on Rick Pitino and Allen Ginsberg (not together). We learn what we want to learn. Walter Kirn learned to cheat and steal. That says more about him than about his summer employment.</p>
