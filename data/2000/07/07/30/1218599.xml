        <p>CHARLIE CHAPLIN'S blessing was also his curse. Nearly a century after he started making movies, he's still thought of primarily as the Little Tramp, the movies' foremost pantomimist.</p>
        <p>But there was another Chaplin underneath the ubiquitous bowler hat and the fake mustache: Charles Chaplin, as he called himself in the credits, an emotional, melancholic filmmaker whose lengthy career -- which ended in 1967 with an ill-advised romantic comedy, ''A Countess From Hong Kong,'' starring Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren, no less -- embraced not only knee-slapping physical comedy but also naked sentiment. Chaplin himself knew this.</p>
        <p>The very first title card of his feature ''The Kid'' (1921) simply states: ''A picture with a smile -- and, perhaps, a tear.''</p>
        <p>Chaplin's output has been available on video for years in various guises: every five years, it seems, a new restoration supersedes previous ones. Now, Image Entertainment has released on DVD three volumes of his 1915 Essanay comedies (at $24.95 each), three volumes of his 1916-1917 Mutual shorts (at $29.95 each) and nine discs containing 10 of his feature films (also $29.95 each), from ''The Kid'' to ''A King in New York'' (1957), all looking and sounding magnificent, thanks to the efforts of the film historian David Shepard.</p>
        <p>As the voluminous DVD bonus materials demonstrate, Chaplin was a perfectionist. The cost of making his features was sky-high for the time, and his film-shot-to-film-used ratio was astronomical: as examples, there were 700 takes of the tightrope sequence in ''The Circus,'' and it was nearly two years from the first shot to the release of ''City Lights.'' As with Stanley Kubrick -- much was said about his extraordinarily long shooting and postproduction schedule on ''Eyes Wide Shut'' -- Chaplin had the rare luxury of making his films exactly as he wanted.</p>
        <p>The six discs of Essanay and Mutual shorts are, quite simply, 12 of the funniest hours ever committed to celluloid, abetted by Chaplin's remarkable ability to temper the more overt comic material with a more sobering air, something he would hone to perfection in his later features. In fact, when he plunged into full-length comedies, he cast himself opposite a child -- the young Jackie Coogan -- but, unsurprisingly, escaped unscathed from this showbiz no-no. ''The Kid'' is a tearjerker in the best sense: as always with Chaplin in his prime, the laughter and the lumps in the throat arise naturally. (As a bonus, ''The Kid'' DVD also contains Charlie's most polished gem of a short, ''A Dog's Life'' from 1918, wherein our hero again explodes established show business wisdom by costarring with a canine.)</p>
        <p>In ''The Gold Rush'' (1925), ''The Circus'' (1928), ''City Lights'' (1931) and ''Modern Times'' (1936), Chaplin created arguably the screen's greatest quartet of classic comedies. With these films, however, Chaplin began moving away from being simply the world's funniest screen comedian. From the starving prospectors of ''The Gold Rush'' to the job-challenged populace of ''Modern Times,'' social awareness became part of his arsenal, while the central relationships in ''The Circus'' and ''City Lights'' underline Chaplin's growing skills in characterization. In fact, the final image of ''City Lights'' -- the Tramp's minutely detailed facial play after the young woman, her sight restored, realizes he isn't the wealthy duke she thought when she was blind -- retains its overwhelming emotional power because Chaplin created credible characters worth caring for.</p>
        <p>One quibble with Image's ''Gold Rush'' DVD: only the 1942 rerelease version, with Chaplin's music and unnecessary narration, is included on the disc, which has apparently subsumed the original. Of course, Chaplin himself created the ''improved'' version, but the constant voice-over is much more obtrusive than the original title cards ever were. (Thank God he never did it for any of the other silent features.) Why not give us both versions and let us choose which to watch?</p>
        <p>Five years separated ''City Lights'' and ''Modern Times.'' His next picture, ''The Great Dictator,'' wasn't released until 1940, partly because of Chaplin's uneasiness over entering the world of sound film: although ''Modern Times'' had a few pockets of dialogue, Chaplin continued making primarily silent comedies because they afforded his persona the best platform. In ''The Great Dictator,'' his typically ingenious solution was to play the dictator Adenoid Hynkel as a Hitler parody complete with nonsense ''German,'' as well as his double, a Jewish barber.</p>
        <p>''The Great Dictator'' still startles with its audacity. Chaplin said that if he'd known about the Nazi prison camps, he'd never have been able to send up fascism, but the result is the most daring political satire this side of ''Dr. Strangelove,'' with Chaplin's most balletic screen moment -- Hynkel dancing with a large globe of world domination -- thrown in as a bonus.</p>
        <p>The ending, though, was something new for Chaplin. He sweated blood over his heartfelt final speech -- as is shown by the many production notes included with the disc -- and, though a mite treacly, it was a necessarily hopeful finish to a film that was released before the United States had even entered World War II, in the days when hope was in extremely short supply.</p>
        <p>Chaplin's other films on DVD, ''Monsieur Verdoux'' (1947), ''Limelight'' (1952) and ''A King in New York,'' represent a falling-off in quality but remain the work of a major director unafraid to put his heart -- as well as his ego, his well-being and his very career -- on his sleeve.</p>
        <p>''Monsieur Verdoux,'' Chaplin's gloss on the Bluebeard story (''see Charlie the lady-killer!'' went the unsuccessful publicity campaign), is a heavy-handed indictment of mass killing, government-style: before he's executed for his crimes, Verdoux makes a passionate pacifistic plea.</p>
        <p>''Limelight'' follows one career in eclipse as another begins to bloom (and Claire Bloom is incandescent in her first screen role); it's undoubtedly Chaplin's most unashamedly personal film, as befits its overlong story of a washed-up vaudevillian who literally dies to allow a young ballerina her moment in the spotlight. ''A King in New York'' likewise fails in its trite efforts to condemn America's Communist witch hunt, which hounded Chaplin out of this country in the 50's; nothing rings quite true in this crude, labored, stillborn comedy-drama.</p>
        <p>These later Chaplin efforts contain sequences as funny and tender and memorable as any he ever filmed -- Verdoux trying (and failing) to kill his latest wife, Chaplin and Buster Keaton teaming for one last bittersweet turn in ''Limelight,'' or the deposed king fighting with a fire hose -- yet the overall impression is of Chaplin's earnestness and bitterness surmounting his once-peerless comedic and dramatic instincts.</p>
        <p>Each DVD is filled with extra goodies, including rarely seen, cut or unused sequences, segments of both scripts and premiere programs, or the wonderful three minutes of footage showing Chaplin conducting part of his own score to ''A King in New York.'' (Chaplin's music for his films is appropriately jaunty or saccharine, depending upon which Charlie is on screen.) The ''King'' DVD also offers the 1923 silent feature ''A Woman of Paris,'' an entertaining if obvious melodrama notable primarily for its not starring Chaplin.</p>
        <p>But the obvious draws in Image Entertainment's series are the films themselves, which include several immortal works. We're unlikely to be blessed again by an artist as original and honest as Charles Chaplin.</p>
