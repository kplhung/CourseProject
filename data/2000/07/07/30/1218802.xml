        <p>JULIANA MERZ got tired of working flat on her back, staring at the ceiling.</p>
        <p>Did Ms. Merz, a decorative artist who paints elaborate murals, designs and finishes on ceilings, walls, floors and any other imaginable surface, feel like Michelangelo working on the Sistine Chapel?</p>
        <p>She did not. ''It was a nightmare,'' she said. ''My neck was killing me,'' Ms. Merz often paints on canvas, which is then glued to the ceiling. ''I just wanted to know when it was going to end.''</p>
        <p>Call her the Princess of Patina, the Queen of Faux. A stylish resident of NoLiTa, Ms. Merz has painted Matisse-inspired florals in a Brooklyn Heights town house garden, Tibetan-style murals in a Greenwich Village town house, fierce sea monsters from the Vatican's Hall of Maps for a Southampton show house and trompe l'oeil landscapes in villas in Tuscany and the Italian Riviera.</p>
        <p>She has marbled, stenciled and glazed her way up and down the Upper East Side of Manhattan, painted doors and cabinetry to resemble mahogany paneling in an apartment at the Carlyle, floors to look like cobblestone, and other floors in four different shades of wood inlay to resemble parquet.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing she can't paint,'' said Ann LeConey, a New York interior designer  who has worked with Ms. Merz for 15 years. ''You see her on scaffolding, electricians trampling over her and under her, and carpenters underfoot. She's just painting away, very focused.</p>
        <p>Larry Goldhirsch, a lawyer, praised the print and floral cutouts Ms. Merz applied to the wall in his Brooklyn Heights garden.  ''You'd swear it was Matisse,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In an era of cookie-cutter mass production, decorative painters like Ms. Merz are Old World-style artisans, masters of illusion who work an alchemy to banish design flaws and make their clients' whims real. Wish you were in the French countryside? Paint it on your wall. Your floors aren't marble?  They are now. Is a room unbalanced with a niche on just one side? No problem.</p>
        <p>The millionaires and billionaires of the business, entertainment and old-money worlds whose homes she paints have whims, indeed. In Tellaro, a fishing village on the Italian Riviera, Ms. Merz painted the pastel Mediterranean view outside the villa inside (presumably so the owners would not have to strain themselves by getting up to look out the window).</p>
        <p>Has she ever been asked to paint a New York view in Gotham? Please. But she has painted a map of Walden Pond for a Thoreau lover on the Upper East Side, a leopard in the jungle on Park Avenue, a Viennese Art Moderne takeoff in the now-closed Canal Bar, and the English countryside, often. ''People put their fantasy world to work when they do this,'' she said. ''It's almost escapism.''</p>
        <p>Like the designers she works for, Ms. Merz, 41, belongs to a breed whose members make polite noncommittal murmurs when asked a client's name. Like pilot fish, decorative painters swim with the same well-connected designers again and again, so there is no need to advertise, circulate fliers or create a Web site (whatever for?).</p>
        <p>''Often there are 30 craftsmen around with madame somewhere being attended to by little seamstresses with pins,'' said Franklin Tartaglione, whose Dynaflow Studios, near Fulton Ferry Landing in Brooklyn, has just finished painting 48 metal fire doors to look like mahogany on Park Avenue. ''That's the kind of exaggerated scenario you run into. It's kind of storybook-like.''</p>
        <p>It's also big business, said Mark Uriu, whose decorative painting firm that bears his name based in the Brooklyn Navy Yard has often worked for blue-chip decorators like Mark Hampton and Colefax &amp; Fowler.</p>
        <p>''It's not unusual to send a private plane to send the right paint over,'' said Mr. Uriu, who is painting a house in the Bahamas, where paint is flown in. ''Budgeting $300,000 to $500,000 for all painting and finishes is not uncommon, since painting is often 5 percent of an overall decorating job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Uriu, who trained in London in the  1970's, said the secret to longevity in the field is making contacts. ''Once you have three to seven sources of work, that's all you need.''</p>
        <p>Decorative painting in the United States has changed since the early 1980's, when the English country look, with lots of chintz and color, became popular thanks to decorators like Mario Buatta and Mr. Hampton.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, the tide has turned.</p>
        <p>''If you say stenciling,'' said Christine Van Deusen, a decorator in Boston who often works in New York homes, ''they go, 'Not those pineapples!' ''</p>
        <p>Today, the looks tend to be cleaner and are used more selectively. ''In the early 1980's, the paint finishes we were teaching,  so cutting-edge then, were pretty simple,'' said Robert Marx, director of the Finishing School in Floral Park, N.Y., where he teaches courses on techniques like marbling, wood-graining and distressing. ''Now they have filtered down to the Home Depot market.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Merz, the daughter of two Brooklyn Heights architects, was already self-employed as a decorative painter when she moved to Tuscany in 1990, to a charming town she first discovered when she dropped out of Oberlin College at 20 to travel. Urged to show her portfolio to Tiziano Lera, an architect for the upper crust in nearby Forte dei Marmi, Ms. Merz, before you could say arrivederci, was soon honing her craft at villas and restaurants.</p>
        <p>After studying at the Finishing School and elsewhere, she worked for another painter before striking out on her own. Concentrating on half a dozen designers whose work appears in Architectural Digest and House &amp; Garden, she sent them one-of-a-kind handmade packages with paper, ribbon and custom-designed business cards, scoring her first project a week later.</p>
        <p>Decorative painting pays well enough --  from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars per project -- that Ms. Merz is able to subsidize her own abstract, minimalist art. Now back in New York for two years, she  need not live the life of a starving artist.</p>
        <p>She deplores the dumbing-down of her craft. ''So much decorative painting goes in the same direction: angels, flowers and fruit,'' she said. ''Every quality decorative painter I know comes up with new finishes of their own.</p>
        <p>''But now all these magazines have instructions to follow,'' she said. ''It's so gross. Without an artist's hand behind it, these techniques only go so far. It should be more of an artisanal thing. It's not paint-by-numbers.''</p>
