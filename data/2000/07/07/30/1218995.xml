        <p>BARRETT-James M., MD died on Monday, July 17, age 59. Dr. Barrett was born in Jacksonville, FL and was raised in New Orleans, LA. He attended medical school at Louisiana State University and did his residency at Johns Hopkins University, Maryland. In 1973, Dr. Barrett moved to South Florida and began his practice with Dermatology Associates. He loved his work so much that he continued working even after he became ill. Board certified with the American Board of Dermatology, the American Board of Dermatopathology and the American Board of Pathology. He was an assistant clinical professor at the University of Miami School of Medicine. He was also a former trustee for the American Skin Association. Dr. Barrett was a lover and supporter of the arts. He was a founding member of the Society for the Performing Arts, which became the Florida Philharmonic Orchestra. He was a former trustee at the Morikami Museum and board member of the Palm Beach County Council of the Arts. An amazingly gifted man and enormously generous of spirit, Dr. Barrett will be dearly missed by all. He is survived by his beloved wife, Millie; his adoring children: Ashley, sonin-law Paul Dalzell; Nicole, Connor and Hadley Barrett.</p>
