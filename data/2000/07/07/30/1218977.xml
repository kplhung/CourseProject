        <p>Al Groh insisted in the week before his first game as a National Football League head coach that he would feel no extra ache in his stomach. This, Groh explained, was just like all the times he went to work as the coach of the Jets linebackers, simply an opportunity to meet the competition, only now on a larger scale.</p>
        <p>Groh may have been that preternaturally placid in anticipation of the Jets' first preseason game, but he undoubtedly saw a few things that will agitate him this week after the Jets' come-from-behind 24-20 victory over the New Orleans Saints tonight at Giants Stadium.</p>

        <p>Al Groh insisted in the week before his first game as a National Football League head coach that he would feel no extra ache in his stomach. This, Groh explained, was just like all the times he went to work as the coach of the Jets linebackers, simply an opportunity to meet the competition, only now on a larger scale.</p>
        <p>Groh may have been that preternaturally placid in anticipation of the Jets' first preseason game, but he undoubtedly saw a few things that will agitate him this week after the Jets' come-from-behind 24-20 victory over the New Orleans Saints tonight at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>The Jets lost three fumbles and nearly lost the game when the Saints' Chad Morton returned a punt 77 yards for a touchdown with five minutes remaining.</p>
        <p>The pass rush, so desperately needed that the Jets used two first-round picks to bolster it, took a while to apply pressure, before those picks, Shaun Ellis and John Abraham, got back-to-back sacks against Saints quarterback Jeff Blake late in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>But Groh got an unanticipated bonus look into the future as the Jets were forced to salvage a game they had led most of the way: the rookie quarterback Chad Pennington directed the winning nine-play, 72-yard touchdown drive that featured the rushing of Vaughn Sanders, the rookie free agent from Hofstra, who scored the winning touchdown with 1 minute 17 seconds to play.</p>
        <p>''I don't like winning and not playing to our standards,'' Groh said. ''And that's what happened tonight.''</p>
        <p>But his starting quarterback, Vinny Testaverde, looked none the worse for his grueling rehabilitation from the Achilles' tear that ended last season minutes after it began. Testaverde moved flawlessly, threw crisply and showed the confidence and resilience that has marked his career when a first-quarter pass intended for Richie Anderson in the right flat fell short and was intercepted at the Saints' 35-yard line. Testaverde took off on an ill-advised chase of New Orleans safety Sammy Knight. Though everyone in the stadium may have been hoping he would stop, Testaverde pursued Knight, lunging for him near the end, until Knight scored.</p>
        <p>Testaverde had said before the game that this was the next critical test in his recovery because he would be facing a live rush, taking fresh hits. Testaverde never took a hit tonight, but that gallop seemed to indicate that whatever psychological wounds Testaverde had borne from the painful injury would vanish during thundering action. His next play showed that -- as his teammate Curtis Martin speculated -- the year of rest may have strengthened Testaverde. On the first play after the Saints' touchdown, Testaverde took the snap on his own 25-yard line, rolled to his right and threw across his body, finding Wayne Chrebet squirting free at the Saints' 45-yard line. Chrebet sprinted down the left sideline for a 75-yard touchdown, and Testaverde celebrated by chest-bumping anyone on the field in green.</p>
        <p>''After the first couple of throws, I felt my confidence was definitely there,'' Testaverde said. ''I take pride in the fact that after the interception we came back as quickly as we did. I'm satisfied. I feel I have a little ways to go to be on top where I want to be.''</p>
        <p>Testaverde's appearance was brief -- he completed five of his nine attempts for 131 yards and was gone after just two full series and the touchdown pass -- but the offense moved well with all three quarterbacks and the passing game, which connected on 25 off 33 passes, racked up 306 of the Jets' 454 yards on offense. In the first half, with a combination largely of the first- and second-string offenses, the Jets were 4 for 4 on third-down conversions and they gained 308 yards -- 202 passing, 106 rushing -- on 35 offensive plays. For the game, the Jets converted 7 of 10 on third down.</p>
        <p>If Testaverde looked ready to start over, then Martin looked as if he had already played eight games. The workhorse running back, who rushed for 1,464 yards last season, was smooth and swift and ran for 48 yards on 7 carries.</p>
        <p>Once Testaverde and Martin were nestled on the bench, the attention turned to the crop of young players on both offense and defense who make up the bulk of the questions surrounding this team. Finding receivers who will fill the gap left by the departure of Keyshawn Johnson is a priority and the rookie tight end Anthony Becht, who is nudging the veteran Fred Baxter for the starting job, made a spectacular catch while on his back early in the second quarter. The pass, from the backup quarterback Ray Lucas, was nearly picked off on the right sideline by the Saints' Fred Weary, but Becht tipped it away. Then, after falling, Becht caught the ball for a first down. On a later drive, Becht would catch a 1-yard touchdown pass from Lucas to give the Jets a 14-6 lead. He finished with 3 catches for 21 yards, and Groh praised his aggressive blocking.</p>
        <p>The rookie Laveranues Coles was used as the third receiver with the offense, and when Lucas was in the game, showed that despite his small stature, he is willing to go over the middle. He caught a 17-yard pass in traffic in the second quarter and his 25-yard reception from Pennington helped set up the winning touchdown.</p>
        <p>Abraham, who has been touted by his defensive teammates as a star in the making, forced a fumble in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>RAY LUCAS was nearly perfect, going 10 for 11 for 88 yards and one touchdown. . . . ROBERT FARMER, a running back fighting to make the team, did not help himself with two fumbles on handoffs but he returned 2 kicks for 40 yards. . . . WINDRELL HAYES fumbled a punt return in the third quarter. . . . Running back VAUGHN SANDERS of Hofstra had a marvelous run in the second quarter, going up the middle for 18 yards, before stumbling at the 1-yard line and trying to crawl his way into the end zone. He finished with 13 carries for 61 yards and one touchdown. . . . Linebacker BRYAN COX lined up at fullback at the goal line, but he let a sure touchdown pass from VINNY TESTAVERDE go off his fingertips.</p>
