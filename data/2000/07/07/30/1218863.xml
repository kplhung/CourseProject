        <p>Chris Gent, the highflying chief executive of Vodafone AirTouch, has discovered that success in making megadeals does not guarantee immunity from shareholder criticism. Last week, Vodafone's annual meeting was the scene of a rare spasm of investor rage among opponents of a $15 million bonus awarded to Mr. Gent in the wake of Vodafone's hostile takeover of Mannesmann. Shareholders said the bonus should not have been paid until the benefits of the Mannesmann deal had been realized.</p>
        <p>Vodafone, the world's biggest wireless company, apologized to investors for its clumsy handling of the issue. But the company defended the bonus by saying that Mr. Gent would use part of it to buy company stock, and by arguing that it had merely brought Mr. Gent's remuneration into line with the company's size after the acquisitions he had negotiated. Last year, according to Vodafone, Mr. Gent earned around $2 million in salary, bonuses and other benefits, not counting a large grant of stock options.</p>

        <p>After shareholders finally approved his bonus, Mr. Gent could afford to be gentlemanly. ''Everyone is entitled to their opinion,'' he said.  ''Obviously, I am pleased with the outcome.''</p>
