        <p>Your eye-opening account of the frightening plight of a Massapequa couple confronted with the enormous cleanup costs from their neighbor's leaking residential oil tank [''The Beast Lurking Under the Lawn,'' July 9] is of major concern to me.</p>
        <p>Your article implied that the State Legislature has done little to address this issue. A measure similar to legislation I have sponsored for many years was finally included in this year's State budget, to provide a $250 for the removal or permanent closure of any residential heating-oil tank and installation of a new fiberglass tank. I applaud my colleagues in the Legislature and the Governor for taking a very important first step to address this issue.</p>

        <p>In addition, I have introduced legislation requiring insurance companies to cover the cost of residential oil-spill cleanups completely. Court decisions upstate have required insurance companies to provide this coverage, and such protection should be available to all homeowners.</p>
