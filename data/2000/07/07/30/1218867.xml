        <p>Corporate America's hiring binge will continue through the end of the year -- though at a slower pace -- especially in telecommunications, information technology and pharmaceuticals companies, according to a survey by Management Recruiters International of Cleveland.</p>
        <p>Of the more than 3,600 executives in the survey, which is conducted twice a year, 53.2 percent said they planned to add to middle and upper management and professional staffs in the second half. That figure was down less than a percentage point from the first half.</p>
        <p>Just over a third of the respondents, 35.6 percent, plan to keep staff sizes at current levels, down 2.6 percentage points. And 11.2 percent plan to cut back, versus 8.1 percent in the first half.</p>
        <p>''If there is any slowing in the economy, and we certainly don't see it, the demand for people continues,'' said Allen Salikof, president and chief executive of Management Recruiters.</p>
        <p>The biggest need was seen in telecommunications, where 80.3 percent of the executives planned increases, followed by information technology, 72.5 percent, and pharmaceuticals, 64.4 percent.</p>
        <p>''We're seeing more companies that are willing to consider candidates outside their own industries, if their skills and experience are transferable,'' Mr. Salikof said. ''When more than 80 percent of the executives surveyed in the telecom industry are seeking to increase their staffs, it's inevitable that they have to enlarge the pool of candidates.''</p>
