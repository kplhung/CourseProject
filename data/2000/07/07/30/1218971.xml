        <p>Within two days in March, one widely prescribed medication was removed from the market and another's use was severely restricted, after each was linked to scores of deaths.</p>
        <p>The removal of Rezulin, a diabetes drug, and the restrictions on Propulsid, a medication for severe heartburn, were coincidental in timing, but served as a double-barreled call to action for lawyers who specialize in large-scale litigation involving products to which illness or injury have been attributed.</p>
        <p>In newspapers and on the radio and the Internet, such lawyers have been advertising their services to people claiming or fearing harm from the drugs, and the first of what are expected to be many lawsuits against the drugs' manufacturers have been filed in federal and state courts across the country.</p>
        <p>Much of this legal warfare is centered in New York City. Because Rezulin's manufacturer had its headquarters in the New York area, and New York law firms are among those recruiting clients for the litigation, federal court officials have directed that all Rezulin suits filed in federal courts anywhere in the country be transferred to United States District Court in Manhattan for consolidated and efficient handling -- a common practice with complex cases that are related. Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy has been assigned to preside over the litigation.</p>
        <p>The advertising for clients who may have been hurt by Rezulin or Propulsid vividly illustrates how an aggressive segment of the legal profession sets the stage for mass-tort actions, those in which suits are brought on behalf of large groups of people who suffer similar illnesses after using the same product. This segment of the bar has long been the subject of bitter debate.</p>
        <p>Its critics, including business groups and members of Congress and law school faculties, say such lawyers are legal buccaneers, even vultures, who are driven by the prospect of millions of dollars in fees to seek excessive punitive damages that inhibit manufacturers and add to the cost of many products. Warren E. Burger, the former chief justice of the United States, was especially riled by such lawyers' advertising for clients, terming it an unseemly spectacle, and he dissented from rulings that upheld the right of lawyers to advertise.</p>
        <p>Defenders of mass-tort specialists, including many consumer groups and others in Congress and academia, say those practitioners level the playing field, making it possible for people hurt by wealthy companies' harmful products to be justly compensated. They also credit this arm of the bar with giving businesses a necessary incentive to exercise care in putting products on the market.</p>
        <p>The lawyers' ads, unless false or misleading, are ''very much in the public interest'' because they permit people to ''learn their rights as soon as possible,'' said Monroe H. Freedman, a legal ethics specialist at the Hofstra University Law School.</p>
        <p>Whatever the arguments, the mass-tort lawyers' machinery is clattering away in relation to Rezulin and Propulsid, much as it did in the past in spawning widespread litigation on behalf of those who contended they were harmed by drugs and medical devices like the antimiscarriage drug DES, the diet pill combination known as fen-phen and the Dalkon Shield, a contraceptive device.</p>
        <p>On March 21, the federal Food and Drug Administration announced that Rezulin -- introduced in 1997 to treat Type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes -- would immediately be removed from the market at the agency's request by its manufacturer, the Parke-Davis division of the Warner-Lambert Company of Morris Plains, N.J. Warner-Lambert has since merged with Pfizer Inc., the Manhattan-based pharmaceutical giant.</p>
        <p>The F.D.A. said in March that Rezulin, which was taken by nearly two million people, had been linked to 90 cases of liver failure, resulting in 63 deaths and 10 liver transplants.</p>
        <p>Two days later, the manufacturer of Propulsid, which the F.D.A. said had been associated with nearly 350 reports of heart rhythm disturbances, including 80 fatal cases, announced that it would withdraw the heartburn drug from pharmacies. Janssen Pharmaceutica of Titusville, N.J., said it would instead distribute the drug free to a limited number of patients for whom all other drugs had failed and who did not have heart conditions or take certain other drugs that made Propulsid potentially dangerous.</p>
        <p>About 10 million prescriptions had been written for Propulsid since it was put on the market in 1993 by Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>
        <p>A Pfizer spokesman, Bob Fauteux, said last week that the company was ''aware of approximately 200 suits'' claiming injury from Rezulin, some involving more than one plaintiff, that had been filed nationwide.</p>
        <p>A Janssen spokesman, Greg Panico, said he did not know the number of Propulsid suits but was sure that ''we do not have hundreds.''</p>
        <p>The two companies say the number of reported adverse reactions to their drugs is small compared with the large number of people who benefited from them.</p>
        <p>But the lawyers who have filed the suits, and those planning to file, insist that the full picture is yet to emerge.</p>
        <p>''Considering that only one serious drug reaction out of 10'' is reported to the F.D.A., said Robert Gordon, a partner in the Manhattan firm of Weitz &amp; Luxemberg, ''we see that as the tip of an iceberg.'' The firm specializes in mass-tort cases involving product liability law. It has run advertisements asking ''Propulsid victims'' to ''fully explore'' their legal rights by calling the firm.</p>
        <p>''The public likes to see it as vultures,'' Mr. Gordon said of lawyers' seeking clients who may have been affected by drugs that have been pulled from the market. ''But the lawyers come in to say, 'How about compensating the people who have been injured?' ''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, however, the legal results are at odds with later scientific findings. The manufacturers of silicone breast implants, for instance, paid $7 billion in judgments or settlements to women who said they were harmed by the devices. But a scientific study last year found no persuasive evidence that the implants were responsible for some of the most devastating ailments the plaintiffs attributed to them, like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
        <p>Marc Jay Bern, of the Manhattan firm of Napoli, Kaiser, Bern &amp; Associates, said that Warner-Lambert had ''failed to advise the medical community as well as the individual potential users of the dangers it knew were inherent in the use of Rezulin, such as potentially fatal liver problems.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fauteux said Warner-Lambert ''appropriately warned of Rezulin's risks,'' while Mr. Panico said the adverse reactions to Propulsid occurred when the drug was not used in an ''appropriate manner.''</p>
        <p>In its newspaper ad, Mr. Bern's firm tells former Rezulin users that they ''may be entitled to financial compensation'' if they have liver troubles or symptoms like swollen legs from a buildup of fluids.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Bern's clients, Bruce Dallow, began to experience leg swelling about a month after he began taking Rezulin in May 1998. Within several months ''his legs were like tree limbs,'' his wife, Helen, recalled last week. Mr. Dallow, 59, of Ridgefield, Conn., is awaiting a liver transplant because of severe damage that he attributes to Rezulin. Mr. Dallow's suit was filed Friday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dallow said that while he had been contending with arthritis and diabetes before using Rezulin, the drug caused weakness and fatigue that left him unable to continue in his job as a security guard.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't say I was Superman,'' he said of his pre-Rezulin days, ''but I was hanging in there.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 31, 2000, Monday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about lawyers' recruiting of clients for product liability suits over two prescription drugs misspelled the name of a firm handling some of the cases. It is Weitz &amp; Luxenberg, not Luxemberg.</p>
