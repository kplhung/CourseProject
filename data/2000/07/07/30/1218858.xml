        <p>THE women, many of them with their heads covered, peer tentatively at the massive bound volume, studying photographs of jewelry, shoes, socks, trousers and other bits of clothing. There is no art here, merely suffering.</p>
        <p>They are searching for some evidence of their loved ones, missing and believed dead in the massacre of Srebrenica, the 1995 murder by the Bosnian Serbs of up to 7,000 men, separated from their families, who thought they were under the protection of the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Since this book was printed on June 12, more than 1,000 families have seen it in the company of local workers from the Bosnian Red Cross. The book contains 1,756 photos with short descriptions, showing the belongings of 354 bodies found near Srebrenica that forensic experts have been unable to identify.</p>
        <p>So far, 92 families have recognized belongings of their loved ones, said Balthasar Staehelin, head of the International Committee for the Red Cross in Bosnia-Herzegovina, giving forensic scientists a very good chance of making positive identifications. More important, some families are closer to knowing what happened to their missing men.</p>
        <p>''Some families even have difficulty opening the book,'' Mr. Staehelin said. ''But for most, not knowing is worse than knowing the worst.''</p>
        <p>The idea for this book came from Rifat Kesetovic, the director of the Podrinje Identification Project, which was established 18 months ago to work exclusively on identifying the missing from Srebrenica. The Red Cross financed its preparation and publication, and is providing local teams to take copies to the families of the missing, and to stand by to provide information and psychological care.</p>
        <p>Srebrenica has become a metaphor for many big topics: the worst atrocity of the Bosnian war; the empty promises of a West in love with its own moralizing; the bureaucratic, murderous failure of a United Nations trying to make peace without fighting; the cowardice of Dutch troops serving with the United Nations who let Bosnian Serbs overrun Srebrenica and watched them march the men away.</p>
        <p>For these women, Srebrenica is an unfilled hole exploded in their lives. Of the 20,000 people reported missing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Red Cross has only been able to resolve the fate of 3,000, even five years after the Dayton agreement that ended the Bosnian war.</p>
