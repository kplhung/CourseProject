        <p>Raceway Park in Englishtown holds quarter-mile, blink-and-you'll-miss it drag races. Usually on the card are low-slung dragsters that go against each other at up to 250 miles per hour, snowmobiles retrofitted to race on pavement and souped-up motorcycles. Then comes something different. They call it the Advanced Trophy Division and it's held most Sundays. It is wide open, which means that as long as you have a car, a drop of gas, a seat belt and a helmet (they are for rent), you can enter. A procession of 50 cars made its way toward the starting line on a recent Sunday and the drivers were teeming with bull-in-a-chute energy. They were big men, small men, bearded men, pot-bellied men, men yelling unprintable words, men in leather, men in jeans, shirtless men. And then there was Shannon Zulla, 20, a soft-spoken woman from Piscataway, who has delicate wire-rimmed glasses and a smile that holds a hint of mischief. She talked about her passion for drag racing.</p>

        <p>Q. What do you drive?</p>
        <p>A. A maroon 1983 Chevy Monte Carlo.</p>
        <p>Q. What's the fastest you've gone?</p>
        <p>A. I've gone 113.</p>
        <p>Q. How did you get started?</p>
        <p>A. My dad, my dad started me. He's been racing since he got his license and I've always wanted to do it. I've been going to races since I was maybe this big. [Puts her hand two feet from the ground.]</p>
        <p>Q. When did you first race?</p>
        <p>A. About two and a half years ago.  They had the Advanced Trophy Division High School Class here and I was the high school champion. The first run I ever made was nerve-racking. I didn't know what to expect. I wasn't scared, I just didn't know what to expect. It was great though, I loved it. Ever since that first run, I've always been, like, when are we going again? When are we going again?</p>
        <p>Q. What are your racing ambitions?</p>
        <p>A. In 20 years, I'd still like to be racing. I would like to be up in the Super Class [top bracket] and maybe be champion of the Super Class.  Maybe be in the division meets, maybe win some big races doing that. Still be racing though.</p>
        <p>Q. If you have children, are you going to introduce them to racing?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, definitely, definitely. I've had a boyfriend, we've been together for the past two years and I've already gotten him into it. I had to.  We're putting together a Camaro for him, my dad, my brother, my boyfriend and I. It's like, all during the week we're doing our own thing, but on the weekend all we want to do is be a family and race.</p>
        <p>Q. What do you like about racing?</p>
        <p>A. I like the speed. The thrill. Every time I go out I get a little nervous and I like that feeling. Anything can happen when you go out there. It's just that thrill. Knowing that everyone is looking at you and wondering how you're going to do, that's great.</p>
        <p>Q. Does it matter if you win or lose?</p>
        <p>A. No. If I lose there's always next week. Try to get them next time, but it's all fun. Better doing it here than on the street.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you ever speed on the streets?</p>
        <p>A. Not really. Is my dad going to see this? Well, once in a while, once in a while.</p>
