        <p>The undercover narcotics detective who shot and killed Patrick M. Dorismond, an unarmed black security guard, on a Midtown sidewalk in March said in a statement released yesterday that race had played no role in the shooting.</p>

        <p>The undercover narcotics detective who shot and killed Patrick M. Dorismond, an unarmed black security guard, on a Midtown sidewalk in March said in a statement released yesterday that race had played no role in the shooting.</p>
        <p>''As an Hispanic American, I am personally aware of the skepticism that some members of the minority community feel toward the criminal justice system,'' said the statement by Detective Anthony Vasquez, who was cleared by a grand jury on Thursday in Mr. Dorismond's death.</p>
        <p>The statement was released by Detective Vasquez's lawyer, Philip Karasyk, who said it was a response to a rally held yesterday in Brooklyn to protest the grand jury's action.</p>
        <p>Detective Vasquez's statement said, ''I urge every concerned citizen to withhold judgment until they have read the grand jury report.</p>
        <p>''I truly believe that, after reading the report, every fair-minded person will conclude that I acted appropriately under the circumstances, and that my actions were in no way influenced by the race, color or creed of Patrick Dorismond.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dorismond's family has suggested that the shooting had racial overtones and has called for a federal civil rights investigation.</p>
        <p>Angry at the grand jury's decision, about 100 people marched in Brooklyn yesterday from Mr. Dorismond's elementary school, Public School 92 on Parkside Avenue in Flatbush, to Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church, where his funeral was held.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the funeral, which drew about 5,000 people and spiraled into clashes between the police and protesters, there were no incidents at yesterday's demonstration.</p>
        <p>It was clear that the police and the event's organizers were both expecting more participants yesterday. The Police Department would not say how many officers had been assigned to the demonstration, but hundreds were stationed along the march route, significantly outnumbering the protesters.</p>
