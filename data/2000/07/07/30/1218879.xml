        <p>For the hundreds of thousands of Iranian expatriates in the Bay Area of Northern California, the soccer star Khodadad Azizi was hailed as a national hero when he arrived last March (along with his wife and 3-year-old daughter) and signed a four-year contract to play for the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer. Unlike many of the aging players who have left leagues in Europe and South America, Azizi, 29, came to the five-year-old American league in his prime, having played three seasons in Germany for F.C. Cologne.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Azizi led Iran to its first berth in the World Cup finals since 1978 and played in the emotionally charged 2-1 victory over the United States in Lyon, France. In 1997, he was the first Iranian named the Asian Footballer of the Year.</p>

        <p>For the hundreds of thousands of Iranian expatriates in the Bay Area of Northern California, the soccer star Khodadad Azizi was hailed as a national hero when he arrived last March (along with his wife and 3-year-old daughter) and signed a four-year contract to play for the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer. Unlike many of the aging players who have left leagues in Europe and South America, Azizi, 29, came to the five-year-old American league in his prime, having played three seasons in Germany for F.C. Cologne.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Azizi led Iran to its first berth in the World Cup finals since 1978 and played in the emotionally charged 2-1 victory over the United States in Lyon, France. In 1997, he was the first Iranian named the Asian Footballer of the Year.</p>
        <p>As the Earthquakes (5-10-8) have struggled in M.L.S. this season, so has Azizi. A lingering hamstring injury has limited him to 13 games, in which he has scored only one goal with four assists. Still, Azizi, on the strength of balloting by his countrymen, was voted to the starting lineup of yesterday's M.L.S. All-Star Game in Columbus, Ohio, finishing fourth among midfielders on the West team with more than 27,000 votes.</p>
        <p>While he was in New York the last week in June for a match against the MetroStars, Azizi toured United Nations headquarters accompanied by the Iranian ambassador, Hadi Nejad Hosseinian, and recorded a public-service announcement in support of the international anti-drug campaign, ''Sports, Not Drugs,'' which will be broadcast in Iran.</p>
        <p>Azizi spoke about his career, his country and his move to the United States with Jack Bell, a staff editor for the sports section of The New York Times, with the assistance of an interpreter, Mehran Molkara.</p>
        <p>Q. You have been called the Persian Michael Jordan. Was there a negative reaction at home when you decided to come to the United States to play?</p>
        <p>A. Look, I am a soccer player. I'm not involved with politics. There was no negative reaction. The people in Iran have no problem with the American people. They like Americans. There are a million Iranians living in the U.S. There has got to be something good about the United States. I always get phone calls from reporters in Iran and they want to know how I have been treated. I talk about the hospitality and the friendliness of people here. I think that many people around the world dream of seeing the U.S. I love Iran and can't truly live anywhere else. But after Iran, this is the best place to live in the world.</p>
        <p>Q. Why, in the prime of your career, did you decide to come to the United States?</p>
        <p>A. Because it is exciting and interesting. I still had the opportunity to play in Europe, but after coming to the United States for a friendly game [Iran-United States in January in Pasadena, Calif.], after I saw all the Iranian fans, I made up my mind to join M.L.S. I chose San Jose because of all the Iranian fans.</p>
        <p>Q. You played several years in the Bundesliga, one of the toughest leagues in the world. How would you compare the quality of play in M.L.S.?</p>
        <p>A. What surprised me the most is that the German league is very physical, but I believe that M.L.S. is more physical and hard. Naturally, in Europe they don't consider M.L.S. a top league, but I believe people think it is going in the right direction and that it is able to attract big stars.</p>
        <p>Q. We have heard that women in Iran are not permitted to attend soccer games. So what is your impression of the popularity of women's soccer in the United States?</p>
        <p>A. I have seen a few games of the American team and, obviously, they deserve to be No. 1 in the world. You can tell you have better youth programs here for girls than anywhere else in the world. In Iran, the reason that women are not allowed in the stadiums is because of the intense environment. It is not a pleasant environment for women to be in. Of course, that could be worked on. This is not a difference in culture; it is a religious thing in Iran. There is now a women's league in Iran, but you don't see men going to watch the women play like in the United States.</p>
        <p>Q. Before the World Cup finals in 1998, many Americans looked at the group that included the United States, Iran, Germany and Yugoslavia and believed that a victory and 3 points against Iran were a virtual certainty for them.</p>
        <p>A. That's exactly how we looked at it when we thought about playing the U.S. We knew it would be harder to get points from Germany and Yugoslavia. I know that the game was a big deal in America, but it was even more important for the people of Iran.</p>
        <p>Q. You were in Iran recently for a tournament. Did you notice any changes?</p>
        <p>A. The atmosphere in Iran is getting better every day, contrary to what many people have heard in the West. The young people follow what is happening in foreign countries. They want to and can visit foreign lands. Travel is not restricted. In my personal opinion, I think that people are more in tune with what is happening in the world than they were 10 years ago.</p>
