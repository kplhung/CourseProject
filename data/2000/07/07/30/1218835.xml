        <p>NOT even ''Melrose Place'' had as many intrigues as the telecommunications industry.</p>
        <p>Let's see. Deutsche Telekom, after failing in its bid to woo Qwest Communications, made VoiceStream Wireless a $50.7 billion offer that it could not refuse. This is the same VoiceStream that had been courted by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan, the world's largest telephone company.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, JDS Uniphase, the maker of components for fiber optic networks, struck a deal to acquire SDL, which is in the same business. Vodafone AirTouch of Britain acquired Germany's Mannesmann in a $183 billion deal that created a European wireless juggernaut. France Telecom agreed to buy Orange P.L.C., the British wireless outfit, for $37.5 billion. Corning, once linked with SDL, was in talks until last week with Nortel Networks about a possible merger of their optical components businesses. (Yes, that Corning, the upstate New York company once best known for oven-safe cookware.)</p>
        <p>All clear? Probably not. Even professional investors are having a tough time making sense of it all. This year, the average telecommunications mutual fund is down 6.7 percent through Thursday, compared with the 1.3 percent drop of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc. The sector took a beating last week after Nokia and WorldCom issued earnings warnings.</p>
        <p>Remember when telecommunications meant telephones, and holding Ma Bell let you sleep at night? These days, top stocks are far more volatile. Qualcomm soared 2,619 percent last year only to lose more than half its value this year.</p>
        <p>''This is not a game for widows and orphans,'' said Oscar Castro, manager of the $497 million Montgomery Global Communications fund, which is down 10.4 percent for the year through Thursday after gaining 104 percent in 1999. ''It's not even a game for day traders.''</p>
        <p>Even the long-term stars are having a rocky time. Flag Investors Communications, one of the top performers of the last decade, is down 17.3 percent in 2000, dead last in the telecommunications fund league, because of big positions in SBC Communications, Lucent Technologies and Alltel.</p>
        <p>''We're in an event-driven situation,'' said Liam Burke, co-manager of the Flag fund. ''Acquisitions are major events. We don't expect major events from SBC, but we do expect them to deliver growth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burke, whose fund remains in the top quarter of telecommunications funds over the last five years despite the swoon this year, said he and the fund's co-manager, Bruce E. Behrens, were strongly disinclined to play mergers. ''There are lots of people in the takeover speculation game,'' he added.  ''We're long-term holders.''</p>
        <p>But it is hard to find stocks that are not involved in the speculation one way or another, as predator or prey. Underlying the  frenzy is a trend toward forming global powerhouses that offer wired and wireless ways to transmit voice, data and video.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately, there will be a small handful, six or eight megacompanies with global assets that will be able to go to Fortune 500 companies and offer them soup-to-nuts services,'' said Scott Lewis, co-manager of the $520 million Warburg Pincus Global Telecommunications fund.</p>
        <p>Certainly, Deutsche Telekom is making a statement that it will be one of them, Mr. Lewis said. The deal for VoiceStream, if it passes regulatory muster, will give Deutsche Telekom, No. 2 behind N.T.T., a foothold in the United States.</p>
        <p>How can an investor best profit from the turmoil and machinations of the telecommunications industry? That depends on which manager you ask.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis said that he and the fund's other managers ''don't particularly attempt to forecast takeout candidates.'' Instead, they prefer to base their moves on relative valuations. One of his favorite stocks right now is Nextlink Communications, a provider of telecommunications services to small and medium-sized companies. He considers it cheap at about six times his projections for this year's revenue. Not that Nextlink doesn't play ball -- in June, it completed a deal to acquire Concentric Network, which provides high-speed Internet access. Nextlink closed at $33 on Friday.</p>
        <p>For Mario Gabelli, manager of the $450 million Gabelli Global Telecommunications fund, the best strategy is a simple one: Pick the acquirees and wait to rake in fat purchase premiums, like the 30 percent premium Deutsche Telekom agreed to pay for VoiceStream. ''The name of the game is not the buyers,'' he said. ''It's who they're going to buy, because of the premiums.''</p>
        <p>ONE of his largest positions is in Telephone and Data Systems, a Chicago company that controls 81 percent of U.S. Cellular, in which Mr. Gabelli's fund also owns a stake. He said he believed that U.S. Cellular would be coveted by companies like AT&amp;T seeking to expand their wireless coverage through acquisitions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Castro of the Montgomery fund begs to differ with Mr. Gabelli's approach.</p>
        <p>''It's a very dangerous play to try to pick what the acquirees will be,'' he said. ''You never know if you'll be acquired. If not, you're left in the desert.'' And even if the deal does go through, he added, ''you'll be paid with a currency that may be devalued'' by a volatile market.</p>
        <p>At the moment, Mr. Castro is bullish on the slumping Lucent, because of the planned spinoff of its fiber component and integrated circuit businesses. ''If you're going to play it, don't play the acquirees,'' Mr. Castro urged. ''Play the ones with a clear strategy of where they're going.''</p>
        <p>Hmm. The experts say bet on the sellers and shun the buyers, or else go with the buyers, or forget about mergers and acquisitions and find companies with staying power. Maybe it's a good time to hide in an index fund until the smoke clears.</p>
