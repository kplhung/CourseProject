        <p>EVERY year, as my husband and I pack the car for our August vacation, we look around at the impossibly green, impossibly beautiful Vermont landscape and ask each other if we are crazy. Why would anyone leave Vermont in the summer, when there are so many swimming holes to splash in, so many country fairs to visit, so many trails to hike. Why would anyone leave during the time of year when our down-country friends would trade in their theater tickets to stay even in the sagging old farmhouse we live in, and a chance to watch the sun set over the mountains and hear the crickets at night.</p>
        <p>One of my closest friends comes to Vermont from the Upper West Side of Manhattan each summer with her husband and two children, renting a house not far from ours. She delights in going fishing and canoeing, taking walks and shopping at the local farmers' market. She and her family love Vermont, and every year Dirk and I have the opportunity to see our home state anew through their eyes.</p>

        <p>EVERY year, as my husband and I pack the car for our August vacation, we look around at the impossibly green, impossibly beautiful Vermont landscape and ask each other if we are crazy. Why would anyone leave Vermont in the summer, when there are so many swimming holes to splash in, so many country fairs to visit, so many trails to hike. Why would anyone leave during the time of year when our down-country friends would trade in their theater tickets to stay even in the sagging old farmhouse we live in, and a chance to watch the sun set over the mountains and hear the crickets at night.</p>
        <p>One of my closest friends comes to Vermont from the Upper West Side of Manhattan each summer with her husband and two children, renting a house not far from ours. She delights in going fishing and canoeing, taking walks and shopping at the local farmers' market. She and her family love Vermont, and every year Dirk and I have the opportunity to see our home state anew through their eyes.</p>
        <p>I realize once again how lucky we are to live within walking distance of a pond that features both good swimming and excellent  boating, and a general store where the owners not only know our names but also extend credit. In summer, the night sky offers northern lights and shooting stars, swooping bats and symphony-quality thunderstorms. There are farms to visit and potters' studios and small gallery shows by wonderful artists. There are mountains to climb and, in nearly every village, a Vermont institution: the ''creemee'' stand, offering soft-serve ice cream in vanilla, chocolate and maple.</p>
        <p>So why, come August, do we pack our two children and our dog and way, way too much stuff into our Subaru wagon and take a grueling, 16-hour drive north? Prince Edward Island, our destination, is, after all, not that much different from Vermont. Cows graze in pastures that slope to the water's edge. Towns are small and manageable, and people are reserved but friendly. ''Vermont with ocean'' is how we describe Prince Edward to our stay-home friends.</p>
        <p>While others may seek cultural stimulation on their vacations, my husband and I see our few weeks off as an opportunity to get some much-needed exercise and simplify our lives. We live in a place that offers plenty of opportunity for both. But whether or not we've brought it on ourselves, we have certainly managed to complicate our lives. We spend many more hours driving our kids to sports and school events than contemplating nature, and much more time absorbed in our work than working out on country roads. Our lives are cluttered with the trappings of contemporary America -- computers and portable phones, TV and videos, stores offering way too much stuff and credit cards offering way too much money to buy it with.</p>
        <p>The main reason anyone who lives in a vacation destination leaves it for another is simple: we live here. We're not on vacation. While my New York friends Pam and Carl may spend their Vermont days splashing with their kids, I spend mine e-mailing, faxing and phoning -- not to mention laundering, shopping, cooking and cleaning. I can't remember the last time I went fishing with my daughters (who, at 15 and 12, would now regard me as demented if I were to suggest it), or did much of anything else with them except drop them at the pond or -- more to their liking -- at the nearest mall.</p>
        <p>I know people who take ''at home'' vacations, visiting all the attractions they never get a chance to see, but I don't think I could manage it. My home is my workplace, and it's hard to get out the door to go recreate while the phones are ringing.</p>
        <p>So each summer we drive north to impose our fantasies of a slower paced life on the Prince Edward Islanders. We do almost nothing for days on end and marvel at how laid-back the islanders are. The friends we have made there do seem to have more time for music and visiting, but that's probably because we are the ones who are dropping by, urging them to pick up their fiddles.</p>
        <p>Surely they have just as much laundry to do, and I often hear their children clamoring to go to ''town'' (as the capital city, Charlottetown, is called) and shop the malls. I've noticed a proliferation of cell phones since we first started going there about 10 summers ago. Last August the carpenter who built the cabin we own gave us his pager number. The rest of the year we communicate with him by fax and e-mail.</p>
        <p>For two or three weeks, we fancy ourselves part of something a little purer, somewhat less materialistic and more genteel than what we experience at home -- just as, I think, Pam feels when she leaves the hubbub of her neighborhood. And it works. Our life on vacation is less crazy and materialistic, and more genteel. I go biking and berry-picking with my daughters, and the four of us sleep outside some nights and watch northern lights and meteor showers even more spectacular than we see at home in darkness that, since we are miles from an electric light, seems more absolute than in Vermont.</p>
        <p>THE weekly trip to the Laundromat seems like a pleasant outing compared with the daily load or two I do routinely at home. Even a trip to the carwash is a maritime adventure: The one in Souris -- the town closest to our cabin -- offers a ridiculously spectacular ocean view. I can count fishing boats and sea gulls while vacuuming the red island clay from the floor mats. Food shopping is a treat: we delight in seeking out fishermen and local gardeners to sell us some of what we will eat each evening. And cooking on the tiny propane stove or over a campfire at our cabin is much more fun than it is at home, where the microwave and the food processor make the chore more mechanical. We play hearts by candlelight and read big fat books that we have no time for back in Vermont. Most important for me is the fact that I get to spend several weeks without hearing a phone ring or a fax beep, or checking any sort of mail whatsoever.</p>
        <p>We leave our home, in fact, for the same reason people in New York or Paris or any other world-class vacation destination leave theirs: for a change of scenery and a change of pace.</p>
        <p>Travelers often indulge in the fantasy that the people in the places they visit lead lives that are more civilized, or more down to earth, or more ''spiritual'' than their own workaday existences. In truth it is the travelers themselves -- separated from familiar rooms and belongings -- who are forced to focus more on who they are and what is important to them.</p>
        <p>We return, of course, to stacks of mail and desks full of the work that piled up while we were away. But if time and distance have worked their magic, we return also with a renewed appreciation for where we live, and a sense of pride that people ''from away'' will travel long distances to gaze at the views we take for granted.</p>
        <p>Recently, some of our friends from Prince Edward Island, who usually stick very close to home, sent us an e-mail message that said they were contemplating a vacation this year. They are thinking of coming to Vermont. We can't wait to show them how laid-back we are.</p>
