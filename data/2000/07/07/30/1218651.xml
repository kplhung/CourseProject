        <p>NOT long after Joe Gurrera opened the first Long Island outpost of Citarella's, the Manhattan gourmet food shop, newspapers reported that Calvin Klein drove by in his Mercedes and had a traffic scrape. The Water Mill site was identified as Citarella's Plaza, dishing out a hefty serving of Hamptons-style A-list publicity for the new store.</p>
        <p>The Hamptons buzz machine revving into gear? Or a simple bit of good luck for Citarella's?</p>
        <p>''Really, I didn't know anything about it until I read it in the paper myself,'' Mr. Gurrera declared. He quickly changed the subject back to food and the new 7,000-square-foot store.</p>
        <p>''Over 200 types of cheese in here,'' he announced. ''Seven kinds of blue cheese alone. You want meat, just walk over here. Follow me. Now look at this meat selection. Do you see the marbling? You're looking at quality.''</p>
        <p>He led a visitor past shelf after shelf of private recipe sauces, marinades, soups and other upscale treats, toward a seafood display that stretched the length of the wall. Some 80 types of fish and shellfish, both raw and prepared, glistened on chipped ice. Eyeing the display were Sheldon and Joyce Pitkin, from Southampton and the North Shore Towers in Queens.</p>
        <p>Until Citarella's opened in May, finding such takeout gourmet fare in the Hamptons was very difficult, Mrs. Pitkin said as she selected grilled pompano for that evening's dinner. Mr. Pitkin, who chooses rotisserie chicken when it's his turn to order, was already over in the baked goods section surveying desserts.</p>
        <p>''These people have already become two of my best customers,'' Mr. Gurrera said.</p>
        <p>Strolling around his store and greeting customers by name, Mr. Gurrera seemed the epitome of the local storekeeper with deep community roots. In fact he is new to the area. Usually he is in Manhattan attending to his other ventures: the Third Avenue store, the Chelsea commissary where food is prepared and shipped, the wholesale outlet in the Fulton Fish Market, a new restaurant taking shape near Radio City.</p>
        <p>Why the Hamptons? Simple, he insisted: the landlord offered him a deal too good to turn down.</p>
        <p>Competition? He dismissed the concept with a wave of the hand: ''Tell me, who else out here is doing what I'm doing? Name them.''</p>
        <p>What Mr. Gurrera is doing in the broader sense is bringing Manhattan-style retail concepts to the East End, and he has plenty of company. This year the fashion designer Betsey Johnson and two upscale, up-Island women's fashion boutiques -- Georgina's and Jimmy's -- have opened storefronts in East Hampton.</p>
        <p>The Hamptons already have national or up-Island names like London Jewelers, Coach, DKNY, Saks Fifth Avenue and Joan &amp; David, and trendy merchants have been elbowing mom-and-pop storekeepers out of East End retail space since at least the 1970's.</p>
        <p>But the pace of change is leaving many residents wondering where they can buy milk, eggs and the kind of underwear that does not sport lithe young models partying on the packaging.</p>
        <p>The changes ''reflect the way the Hamptons are becoming chic-er,'' said Marina Van, longtime executive director of the East Hampton Chamber of Commerce. ''People are dressing up more. It isn't O.K. anymore to go everywhere in jeans and T-shirts. People are buying nice clothes to wear, and the stores in town reflect that.''</p>
        <p>At Georgina's Boutique, shoppers can spend $5,000 on an evening dress, said the owner, Christina Makowski. Many customers recognize the store from its flagship branch in Manhasset and a newer branch in Hewlett Harbor.</p>
        <p>It isn't just the money-is-no-object fashion crowd. Mass merchandisers like Starbucks and Kmart have opened in Bridgehampton, where a new Barnes &amp; Noble branch is rumored to be in the works.</p>
        <p>Residents respond with mixed reactions and clear hierarchies of desirability. A new branch of a store that already exists in the area is better than an interloper with no previous local presence. A store owned by a resident trumps a store owned by outsiders. Converting an existing building is better -- far, far better -- than building new.</p>
        <p>Most residents agree that the hulking superstores should stay west of Riverhead, but reasonably sized outlets are welcome. The disagreement is over what size is reasonable. Both A&amp;P and King Kullen already operate supermarkets here, but encountered opposition when they announced plans to open larger stores. The struggle for community approval could stretch out for years.</p>
        <p>It's a point of status among local residents to shop at local stores, or at least to proclaim they do. But second-home owners routinely make detours off the expressway to stock up on items that cost noticeably more east of Riverhead.</p>
        <p>''When Starbucks opened in Bridgehampton, it was clear to me that we'll be seeing more of the national chains coming to the East End,'' said Marcia Rosen, a marketing consultant based in Westhampton Beach. ''But that's not to say that the local retailers are going to roll over. To succeed as an independent merchant out here really requires you to understand what makes the Hamptons the Hamptons. People who shop here are buying more than just the product, they're buying atmosphere. And they're willing and able to pay for atmosphere.''</p>
        <p>Steven Gaines, who operates a Web site called ihamptons.com and is the author of a best-selling book about Hamptons status-seeking called ''Philistines at the Hedgerow,'' feels a sense of loss each time a local merchant closes for the last time.</p>
        <p>''I used to love to walk by a store called Pets Painted With Love, in East Hampton,'' he said. ''People would bring their pets and the owner would paint their portraits. Today, that store is Ralph Lauren. The Ralph Lauren store is wonderful, but something unique is gone forever.''</p>
        <p>He continued, ''Starbucks? That's an abomination. Enormous sign. Red velvet banquettes. Velvet? The Hamptons? Please!''</p>
        <p>It's no surprise that mass merchandisers covet the East End. Every summer the population swells from 125,000 to 600,000, producing a median household income exceeding $85,000. But the very seasonality that entices savvy local merchants has in the past deterred the mass merchandisers.</p>
        <p>That situation is changing.</p>
        <p>''Many of the second-home owners are now here year-round,'' said Herbert Sherman, a professor of professional studies at Southampton College. ''Technology enables professionals to live here and telecommute to Manhattan or elsewhere. Retirees are making their second home their retirement home. The year-round population is growing.''</p>
        <p>That includes laborers, many of them immigrants working in the construction and landscaping trades who enjoy increasing buying power. ''For the first time, the Hamptons now has a real Mexican restaurant with Mexican customers,'' Professor Sherman said. ''I don't mean Tex-Mex, I mean rice and beans.''</p>
        <p>Throwbacks to earlier, less glitzy times remain. On gritty Front Street in Greenport, The Arcade is a five-and-dime store that dates from the mid-19th century. During the week working-class residents come in to buy inexpensive clothing and household goods including fabrics and sewing supplies. On weekends tourists come in and gape as if the sundries and notions, the fixtures and displays were all a theme park display.</p>
        <p>The survival of the store as a purveyor of necessary goods to working people is vital to the community, both economically and culturally, Mayor David Kapell said.</p>
        <p>''This is a store that sells needles and thread, for goodness sake,'' the mayor said. ''It's what Main Street America used to be. It sets us apart from the other East End communities, and frankly, that's exactly what we want to preserve.''</p>
        <p>It is exactly those other communities, and the wealth they represent, that appeals to a growing number of mass merchants. Despite such difficulties as seasonality and, increasingly, staffing, the East End as a market is increasingly in demand -- as much for marketing reasons as for profitability.</p>
        <p>''The East End is increasingly filled with prestigious retailers,'' said Cindy Smith, president of the Retail Marketing Group, a division of EGC Media in Hicksville. ''You have your permanent population, your second-home owners, and plus you get tremendous tourism. When people travel they see new products and often try them out. Back home, the products seem more familiar because of that exposure.''</p>
        <p>The changes have not left everyone pleased. Retailers, including Hildreth's -- purportedly the oldest department store in America, founded in 1842 -- have thrived by offering personalized style and a merchandise mix carefully selected for local preferences.</p>
        <p>''My name is on the front of the building, it's painted on the trucks, it's printed on the bags,'' said Henry Hildreth, the fifth generation of his family to operate the store, on Main Street in Southampton. ''If something is not right, I'm going to stand behind it, just as my father did.''</p>
        <p>Two stores away, Herrick Hardware has been in the Herrick family for four generations. Unlike the vast majority of Main Street hardware stores across the country, Herrick is not operating under the shadow of a Home Depot. Zoning practices, political consensus and community activism combine to make it unlikely that a megastore will open east of Riverhead anytime soon.</p>
        <p>''There's no Home Depot down the block, but that isn't to say I have no competition,'' said Herrick Hardware's proprietor, Noel Hare, who married into the family business. ''There are lumber yards and hardware stores in every village. Yet I draw customers from other villages, and I attribute that to service. That in the long run is what makes the difference between a mass merchant and an independent retailer.''</p>
        <p>Not every retailer shares his attitude. According to Mr. Gaines, paying outrageous prices seems to have become a competitive Hamptons sport, with an ancillary contest in which customers vie to be the most unpleasant. At one well-established upscale food shop, he said, a young clerk tried to dispatch a particularly disagreeable customer by pricing salad at $86 a pound.</p>
        <p>Sounding incredulous, Mr. Gaines reported that the customer simply shrugged and said, ''Fine, I'll take two pounds.''</p>
