        <p>WESTCHESTER County's first Human Rights Commission has begun taking bias-related complaints as officials step up efforts to combat hate crimes.</p>
        <p>''The commission is a natural next step, since Westchester has woken up and found the disease here,'' said John Zuroski, the commission's executive director. ''The first step was in the criminal area. But now it moves to the civil law area. I think this will be the biggest step because it can affect more people.''</p>
        <p>The commission will investigate and, if necessary, hold hearings on complaints of discrimination in employment, public accommodation, housing and credit based on race, color, religion, ethnicity, creed, age, national origin, citizenship, family connection, gender, marital status, sexual orientation or disability.</p>
        <p>Until now, the main agency addressing such crimes was the bias crime unit of the District Attorney's office.</p>
        <p>Since 1997, that office has investigated 252 cases involving possible bias crimes, resulting in 76 arrests. This year, 32 cases have been investigated, and 15 people have been arrested.</p>
        <p>Westchester is the only county in the state that requires police departments to report possible hate crimes to the county.</p>
        <p>''It is clearly increasing,'' District Attorney Jeanine Pirro said. ''Whether that is because municipalities have a duty to report them or because people think they can get justice if they come forward, it is hard to tell.''</p>
        <p>In late May, Assistant District Attorney Mayo G. Bartlett was put in charge of the bias crime unit. Mr. Bartlett, a graduate of Pace University Law School, has worked in the District Attorney's office since 1992. He estimates that a quarter of the bias incidents in the county are directed against property, like graffiti and vandalism. The rest are directed against people and include crimes like assault, robbery and aggravated harassment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zuroski was Mr. Bartlett's predecessor at the bias crime unit.</p>
        <p>Besides legal remedies, anti-bias efforts are also focusing on education. In January, Westchester will send police officers to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international human rights organization, in New York for a day of diversity training.  The course is modeled on a similar class the center has offered in Los Angeles since 1995.</p>
        <p>More than 40,000 police officers and 20,000 educators from around the country have taken part.</p>
        <p>The course in New York will be available on a voluntary basis to members of the county's 44 police departments, along with the county police. The program will also be offered to teachers. Issues covered will include hate, the immigrant experience, anti-Semitism, racism and civil rights.</p>
        <p>County Executive Andrew J. Spano also plans to work with the Wiesenthal Center to start a program so the elderly can volunteer to monitor hate groups on the Internet. These volunteers would then visit schools and discuss the dangers posed by online hate groups. This effort, to be called the Senior Sentinel Program, will begin sometime next year.</p>
        <p>''The people who want to promote hate, use the Internet very skillfully,'' Mr. Spano said. ''But we have a lot of skilled people here, and we can use it positively. By monitoring the Internet, what we're trying to do is answer free speech with free speech.''</p>
        <p>Last month the Westchester Holocaust Commission and the Anti-Defamation League completed the first session of the Juvenile Offenders Program. The program is a 20-hour classroom course for youngsters convicted of bias crimes or involved in bias incidents in school.</p>
        <p>Besides awareness training and anger management, participants must complete 15 hours of community service. Two 15-year-olds referred to the program by the court system were the first to take the course.</p>
