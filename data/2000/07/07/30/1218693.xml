        <p>WHO is the most misunderstood, misread person of all? I would say it's the critic. And what is the world's vaguest profession? Criticism, of course.</p>
        <p>But is criticism really a profession? Samuel Beckett would likely have answered, ''Ah.''</p>
        <p>Other questions are not so easily answerable: What is the critic's purpose? What about responsibility? Is it to serve the theater or the audience? And what audience, the actual or the potential?</p>
        <p>One thing is certain. Regional theater is not commercial theater, and whoever writes about it is obliged to do so within the context of that theater's mission and body of work. A review of a play at the Long Wharf in New Haven, for example, demands a consideration of just what that theater stands for and what it means, within its community and to the world of theater.</p>
        <p>To Janice Muirhead, the artistic manager of the newly reorganized Westport Country Playhouse, all those questions about the role of the critic, are ponderable. But one can be sure, she says, that she and the theater's leaders -- Joanne Woodward, Anne Keefe and Elissa Getto -- are pondering those questions, and trying to come up with answers that suit the landmark summer theater they  are redefining.</p>
        <p>Vision and long-range goals are still unclear at Westport. After the unfashionable feat of rescuing a theater from real estate developers,  keeping that theater going is enough for now. Questions about expansion, a year-round season and reshaping a theater with a summer stock image into a credible regional theater are all premature. But where and how do critics fit in?</p>
        <p>This season, Westport's new management has designated the first Wednesday night performance of a two-week run as press night, to give the players two more opportunities to be ready for the media. That (or a later one) is the performance to be reviewed. Each of the summer's shows has 16 performances. Practically speaking, the first three performances (Monday and Tuesday evenings and Wednesday matinee) are previews, though the playhouse does not use that word. In the past, the very first performance, on Monday, was officially opening night, the second press night. Now the fourth performance is press night. And , another question arises: should any performance during a two-week run be material for critics?</p>
        <p>Whatever its future, Westport is still summer stock. Given that designation, should it be subjected to critical scrutiny? Or are members of the press viewed as providers of free publicity?</p>
        <p>And no matter that reviews are invited, isn't ''Triangles for Two'' a work in progress? And reviews of plays or musicals in that evolving stage are usually uncalled for since they turn a critic into a play doctor or an unpaid consultant.</p>
        <p>At Goodspeed Opera in East Haddam, a second theater in Chester is reserved for just those evolving musicals. Critics are asked not to review these productions, and yet on at least two recent occasions, reviews were solicited. Some productions in the most credible regional theaters had independent commercial producers standing by, uninviting some reviewers, welcoming others.</p>
        <p>Trying out a play for a commercial afterlife is not within the realm of regional theater, yet, in one way or another, it happens all the time. (If it didn't, there would be hardly any plays on or off Broadway.)</p>
        <p>Westport's last show of the summer, a new musical called ''Nicolette and Aucassin,'' is sure to have producers ''waiting in the wings,'' Ms. Muirhead said. She said she saw it in workshop in Manhattan in February and that it was really good. She said she told Ms. Woodward, who suggested that Ms. Muirhead get it. And that's how collaboration -- ''that's our favorite word around here,'' Ms. Muirhead said -- works.</p>
        <p>''There is something about summer stock that sounds so formulaic,'' Ms. Muirhead said, ''and we have to get away from the perception that we're doing it by rote.''</p>
        <p>Westport Playhouse's alliance with Williamstown Theater Festival this summer (a shared production of Austin Pendleton's ''Orson's Shadow'') places it on the road to regional theater credibility, even though the play's reviews in Connecticut were mixed to negative, said Ms. Muirhead, who called the play ''a noble project.''</p>
        <p>Which brings up the effect of reviews on the box office, and whether the critic is supposed to be a consumer advocate. ''We can't say that positive reviews have helped sell tickets so far,'' Ms. Muirhead said, ''but we know that negative reviews can kill.'' Ultimately, she said, it is word of mouth that sells tickets.</p>
        <p>Ms. Muirhead talked about how things work at Westport, where six plays are performed in 12 weeks.</p>
        <p>''Right after the final curtain on a Saturday night, the sets are taken down, the lights reset, all that,'' she said, ''Our technical crews work all day Sunday, when the theater is dark. Rehearsals, which have gone on for three weeks, can take place for another five hours, perhaps Sunday, perhaps Monday. It is not fair for creative people to be reviewed,'' Ms. Muirhead added, ''before they have given four public performances. Plenty can happen, extraordinary changes, from one performance to another.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Muirhead explained that levels of each performance are different, the audience response may be different, and rewriting is conceivable. ''The audience is our first instrument,'' she said, ''the first one might be friendly, the second tough but perhaps truer, and that's how adjustments are made.</p>
        <p>''Perhaps critics can help people shape decisions,'' Ms. Muirhead continued. ''We offer a palette of plays and for us, the end result that counts is the magical collaboration called theater.''</p>
        <p>It may be that one need look no farther for the purpose of criticism than to Noel Coward who said, ''I love criticism just as long as it's unqualified praise.'' But it is up to Samuel Beckett to have the last word. In ''Waiting for Godot,'' Vladimir and Estragon indulge in a name-calling contest. ''Moron!'' one says. ''Vermin!'' the other responds. And so on, until Estragon wins. With finality, the stage direction reads, he spews out: ''Crritic!''</p>
