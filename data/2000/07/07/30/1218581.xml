        <p>LEIDEN, a walkable city on two small branches of the Rhine River, is something more than a nice little Dutch town, as it was once described to me by a friend who lived there. Although unmistakably Dutch in appearance -- with quiet neighborhoods of gabled, canalside houses and a small open-air market selling North Sea herring and wax-covered wheels of Gouda -- Leiden's window on the world is larger than its population of 117,000 would indicate.</p>
        <p>Almost since the founding of its university in 1575, the city has attracted some of the brightest minds in Europe, and these days scholars from around the world go there to teach and conduct research. The 11,000 students who attend the University of Leiden and fill the city's dark, smoky coffeehouses keep things from getting too fusty.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because of its academic tradition and the Netherlands' historic role as a crossroads of international commerce, Leiden is a city of museums. With the exception of Amsterdam, which is 35 minutes northeast by train and has a population nearly seven times that of Leiden, no other city in the Netherlands has such a broad range of museums -- a dozen, large and small, covering everything from classical antiquities to the history of medicine, to windmills.</p>
        <p>And for its size, Leiden is unusually rich in historic sites. Rembrandt was born there;  the city was an early center of publishing and medicine, and the first tulips in Holland were planted in the university's botanical garden. In the 17th century America's Pilgrim Fathers took refuge in Leiden before leaving for the New World via Plymouth, England.</p>
        <p>Given our brief two days there in March, my partner, Mac, and I decided to limit our museumgoing to three or four institutions and our historic sites to those we could see on a leisurely walk around Leiden's compact city center. It proved to be a good plan, although we had to make several adjustments when confronted with unexpected closures and renovations.</p>
        <p>Knowing that many of the museums are closed on Mondays, we arrived on a Tuesday. It was a cold and gray morning on the cusp of spring at the city's modern glass-and-steel train station. Exiting through a sea of bicycles parked outside the station, we walked 10 minutes to the Rapenburg, a handsome tree-lined canal along which some of Leiden's most prosperous citizens built stately homes in the 17th century, when the city was flush with money from the production of woolen cloth. We stopped briefly to leave our bags at the Hotel De Doelen, a converted 1638 neo-Classical mansion where we were spending the night, and then continued to the university and its botanical garden.</p>
        <p>The origins of the university and of Leiden's eventual prominence lie in a Spanish siege of the city in 1574 during the Protestant Dutch revolt against the iron rule of Catholic Spain. Thousands of its citizens died of starvation and disease during the siege, and popular belief has it that the mayor, one Van der Werf, convinced a ravenous mob not to surrender only by offering his own body as food. A nice story, but as noted with admirable candor in a booklet I picked up at Leiden's tourist office, ''its accuracy is dubious, since the annals show that Van der Werf had to be dissuaded from opening the gates to the Spaniards on more than one occasion.''</p>
        <p>The booklet also casts doubt on another popular belief, that the university was a gift from William of Orange in appreciation for Leiden's successful resistance. Instead, it appears, the Protestant Low Countries simply needed their own university, and Leiden made sense because it was freed early on from Spain.</p>
        <p>The main ceremonial building of the university, the Academy (Academiegebouw), occupies a former Dominican convent on the Rapenburg. A dignified, two-story brick structure with a steep slate roof and a domed bell tower, the Academy still resembles a church, although it is now used for lectures and official university functions.</p>
        <p>Behind the Academy is the university's Hortus Botanicus, a botanical garden originally laid out in 1590 as a place to grow and study medicinal and poisonous plants. In the 16th century such gardens were common at universities with medical schools, but the first curator of Leiden's garden, the Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius, eventually had the novel idea of creating a place where all known plants would be collected and studied. As a result, imports from the New World -- such as the tomato, the potato, tobacco and corn -- were introduced into Northern Europe through the Leiden garden. Clusius also introduced tulips to Holland (they were originally from Turkey), first planting them in the Hortus in 1594.</p>
        <p>Over the centuries, Clusius' garden has grown into a large oasis of old trees, flowers and thousands of plant species from around the world, although on the day we visited the entrance was torn up by the construction of a new winter garden (which opened in May), and the garden still had its bare, winter look. As we walked around, however, we did come across a few signs of spring -- several beds of crocus, swelling nodes on an ancient wisteria, and a scattering of solitary daffodils, whose yellow blooms looked particularly vibrant under the steely sky.</p>
        <p>A light drizzle eventually drove us into the garden's extensive greenhouses, where we happily wandered through the heavy, warm air, passing under towering tree ferns and stopping to examine a carnivorous plant from Borneo or cerise-colored blooms sprouting like miniature feather boas from the branches of a New Guinea euphorbia.</p>
        <p>BACK outside, we retraced our steps along the Rapenburg to the National Museum of Antiquities (Rijksmuseum van Oudheden). It's the principal archaeological museum in the Netherlands, and we'd been looking forward to seeing its outstanding collection of Egyptian and Classical Greek and Roman artifacts.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, we found the museum in the midst of a major renovation (scheduled to be completed next spring), and most of its permanent collection was on loan or in storage. What we did see whetted our appetites -- papyrus manuscripts, beautifully proportioned Greek vases, translucent alabaster cups and solemn, marble busts of eminent Romans. We both enjoyed a small display devoted to the ancient Egyptian love of beer, and also managed to peek into the museum's most dramatic gallery (which was closed): a covered courtyard filled with heroic-sized statuary and an entire temple of Isis rescued from the rising waters behind the Aswan Dam.</p>
        <p>We ate a light lunch at Camino Real, a cozy, two-level restaurant that occupies a former stable just around the corner from the Academy. Surrounded by an animated university crowd of professorial types in worn tweed jackets and students in jeans and T-shirts, we split a bowl of flavorful celery-onion soup and a sandwich of cheese, smoked salmon, avocado and mixed greens on Italian flatbread.</p>
        <p>By the time we finished, the overcast sky had yielded to brilliant blue with billowing white clouds, so we spent the rest of the afternoon walking around Leiden's center, stopping frequently to investigate a shop or a historic building, or to admire spring blooms placed in the front window of a house. Here and there were mural-sized poems painted on the sides of buildings.</p>
        <p>At Pieterskerk, a large old church a block off the Rapenburg, now used for concerts and other nonreligious functions, we saw a memorial plaque dedicated to John Robinson, the Pilgrims' spiritual leader. The Pilgrims arrived in Leiden in 1609 and left for America in 1620, in part because they feared that cosmopolitan Leiden would corrupt their morals. Robinson intended to join them later but never made it, dying in Leiden in 1625. We weren't able to see inside the church since it was closed, but on a nearby pedestrian lane of pleasant shops and restaurants (Pieterskerk-Choorsteeg) we did spot a plaque marking the site of the Pilgrims' printing press.</p>
        <p>Across from the church, at Kloksteeg 21, we sat for a while in the quiet, grassy courtyard of the 1683 almshouse that replaced Robinson's residence. During Leiden's golden era, well-to-do individuals -- some getting on in years and worried about the salvation of their souls -- built small houses where elderly poor people could live for free.</p>
        <p>The almshouses are known in Dutch as ''hofjes,'' or ''little courtyards,'' because they were traditionally built around a common court that had a single opening onto the street. While many of Leiden's 35 existing hofjes are now private residences, some courtyards are open to the public; the visitors center has a brochure outlining a walking tour.</p>
        <p>The next day we arrived at the National Museum of the History of Science and Medicine, known as the Boerhaave Museum, just as it was opening. It had not been high on our list of museums, but our friend Oliver Moore, who had recently moved to the city, had convinced us that it had more to offer than pickled brains and scary old surgical implements. It is housed in a beautifully renovated building where Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738), an innovator in clinical medicine, founded one of the first teaching hospitals in the world. The collection is quirky -- ranging from exquisitely crafted microscopes of polished brass to an amusing display of antique apothecary shop signs from Amsterdam, each depicting a human head with mouth agape. I was particularly fascinated by a reconstruction of Leiden's Theatrum Anatomicum, a steeply raked anatomical theater where Boerhaave and others performed human dissections while skeletons and other memento mori loomed overhead.</p>
        <p>Later that day we toured a collection of old Dutch tile, household furnishings and paintings at the Lakenhal Municipal Museum (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal), which occupies the city's 1640 cloth hall. In the galleries we saw one of Rembrandt's earliest dated paintings, ''An Unidentified Historical Subject,'' a fussy mythological scene from 1625 that is far more detailed and far less striking than his mature works. Although Rembrandt first studied painting in Leiden, he became famous only after settling in Amsterdam in 1631. His boyhood home no longer exists, but other sites connected with his youth in Leiden -- such as the street (Weddesteeg) where he grew up and the Latin School on Lokhorststraat where he studied -- still survive.</p>
        <p>Toward the end of the day, while on our way to the train station, we stopped at the restored 18th-century windmill that now houses the Valk Municipal Windmill Museum (Stedelijk Molenmuseum De Valk). The Valk is one of about 950 windmills left in the Netherlands, down from 10,000 about 100 years ago.</p>
        <p>Oliver's wife, Ts'ai Ch'in, had encouraged us to visit the Valk, and once inside I could see why. After a brief look at the informative historical displays, we clambered up ladder-like steps, passed the massive grinding wheels and stepped onto the outside platform, where the mill's huge sails swooped precariously close to our heads. Although we had a train to catch, we lingered a few minutes, enjoying a bird's-eye view of Leiden and the bracing feel of North Sea wind on our faces.</p>
        <p>A city of museums, from classical antiquities to medicine to windmills</p>
        <p>Lodging and Dining</p>
