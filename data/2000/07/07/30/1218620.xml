        <p>May 1999: Vienna, an outdoor cafe</p>
        <p>I fantasize about being a young woman from Chekhov's play ''The Seagull'' in the Russian countryside, or Helena Bonham Carter in a Merchant-Ivory film. When I first moved to Germany in 1991 and started touring in Europe as a member of the Frankfurt Ballet, I had moments of understanding what it means to be civilized by European standards, which sometimes left a strange taste in my mouth. I enjoyed long afternoon coffees with friends, discussing politics and our personal lives, then took a trip to the sauna and eucalyptus steam bath. Typical health clubs in Germany were co-ed and people were teased if they wore a bathing suit or felt self-conscious about being naked.</p>
        <p>When on tour, after leaving my single room in a four-star hotel and taking a trip to the theater to set up my place in the dressing room, my mouth would gape open as I walked through opera houses dripping with Rococo designs supported by beautiful Corinthian columns. I spent eight years touring with the company, socializing with friends after performances, enjoying a fine wine, which is considered medicinal in Mediterranean countries, and walking into receptions with diplomats and cabinet members who were dressed in the latest Helmut Lang or Issey Miyake clothes. It was a new way of life. I could smell centuries of history in the walls and hallways of each building I visited.</p>

        <p>May 1999: Vienna, an outdoor cafe</p>
        <p>I fantasize about being a young woman from Chekhov's play ''The Seagull'' in the Russian countryside, or Helena Bonham Carter in a Merchant-Ivory film. When I first moved to Germany in 1991 and started touring in Europe as a member of the Frankfurt Ballet, I had moments of understanding what it means to be civilized by European standards, which sometimes left a strange taste in my mouth. I enjoyed long afternoon coffees with friends, discussing politics and our personal lives, then took a trip to the sauna and eucalyptus steam bath. Typical health clubs in Germany were co-ed and people were teased if they wore a bathing suit or felt self-conscious about being naked.</p>
        <p>When on tour, after leaving my single room in a four-star hotel and taking a trip to the theater to set up my place in the dressing room, my mouth would gape open as I walked through opera houses dripping with Rococo designs supported by beautiful Corinthian columns. I spent eight years touring with the company, socializing with friends after performances, enjoying a fine wine, which is considered medicinal in Mediterranean countries, and walking into receptions with diplomats and cabinet members who were dressed in the latest Helmut Lang or Issey Miyake clothes. It was a new way of life. I could smell centuries of history in the walls and hallways of each building I visited.</p>
        <p>Being a member of the Frankfurt Ballet contradicted all this old-world civilization. We were doing challenging work that explored tough social and political questions. Being the African-American daughter of a civil rights lawyer and a former dancer, I was probably led there by fate.</p>
        <p>April 1990: Frankfurt, Maxim's Disco</p>
        <p>The first part of my audition for the Frankfurt Ballet, which took place eight months after I was laid off by the Dance Theater of Harlem, was at a disco. William Forsythe, the company's director and choreographer, wanted to see how I interacted with people and moved outside a studio. Afterward, I told my best friend, Alan Barnes, how amazed I was that the director seemed like such a normal person, sipping on his Cristalle Weizen beer while Boy George's ''Kharma Chameleon'' blasted in the background. Alan, who had also been a member of the Dance Theater of Harlem and had joined the Frankfurt Ballet in 1988, assured me that it was normal behavior.</p>
        <p>(I finally understood Bill's open nature when I saw him in a documentary on Sylvie Guillem, an etoile with the Paris Opera Ballet. He was wearing Nike Air sneakers and eating a hero sandwich while choreographing a solo for her. I had the feeling this man was irreverent about the conservative nature of the classical ballet world but respectful of each individual artist he worked with. The unorthodoxy thrilled me.)</p>
        <p>The next day, Nora Kimball, an African-Asian American who had been a soloist with American Ballet Theater and was now a principal dancer with Frankfurt, taught me a solo from Bill's ''In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.'' A day later, I presented the solo to Bill in a private audition. We spent three hours working together, with Bill watching and coaching me. (This audition process gave me a sense of the variety of work done at the Frankfurt Ballet, and that thrilled me, too.)</p>
        <p>After the session, Bill asked me to join the company, where I became a principal dancer in 1994, a big leap over my status as a corps member at the Dance Theater of Harlem. I canceled my auditions in Stuttgart and Hamburg, deciding this was where I wanted to be, without any doubt. With the Frankfurt Ballet, my roles required me to go from performing the ''Agon'' pas de trois, to dancing on point in a lime-green tutu, to singing as a deaconess in a Japanese gospel choir in ''Alie/n A(c)tion.''</p>
        <p>In ''The Loss of Small Detail,'' my most challenging role, I recited from a Mishima text on a minimally dressed stage. I loved sitting alone at a table, center stage, and hearing my voice in Dolby sound throughout the theater. (Bill always had the latest in sound and lighting.) After dancing ''Self Meant to Govern,'' in which we had to improvise onstage for 45 minutes, my colleague Jill Johnson said that we had earned the equivalent of our Ph.D.'s in dance. I became completely addicted to this complex, collaborative way of working.</p>
        <p>March 1996: Montpellier, France, 9:46 p.m., curtain call</p>
        <p>Five years into dancing with the Frankfurt, while bowing after a performance, I looked into the audience and noticed something that I hadn't seen before: there was not one minority person there. I didn't think much of it then, but a few months later, back home in the Frankfurt Schauspielhaus, this fact surfaced again. The audience was completely white; on those rare occasions when I saw a person of color, he or she was a friend or relative of a company member. (From 1994 through 1996, approximately a third of the company was African-American, with one African-Asian American; there was more ethnic variety onstage than in the audience.) I asked myself why the Africans, the Caribbean and American blacks, whom I saw on the street or mixed with socially, didn't come to the theater. As a member of the Dance Theater of Harlem I had always seen mixed audiences.</p>
        <p>I'm not exactly sure why this should be with the Frankfurt, which had a cult following as well as a young and intellectual audience. Perhaps throughout Europe a new, broader-based audience needs to be cultivated.</p>
        <p>Winter 1998: Frankfurt</p>
        <p>After my seventh year in Frankfurt I started missing the chaotic melting pot of New York City, where I grew up. I remember traveling on the subways as a young teenager from Greenwich Village to Nightingale-Bamford on the Upper East Side. My parents had worked hard to pay the tuition. It was a sign that I had to leave Germany and its orderly perfection. I needed the smell of the subways, the vendors selling their cheap metal jewelry, passing it off as sterling silver, and a stronger sense of my own community. Somehow I realized that I would not have been a guest at Uncle Vanya's country home, but serving the guests in the garden.</p>
        <p>What would I do? I couldn't think of another company I wanted to dance with after the Frankfurt Ballet. I had been choreographing for years during my free time and writing my own songs with various producers. Could I do musical theater? Could I act? Should I start my own company? At the same time, I had pangs of sadness at the thought of leaving this secure and exciting dance world, and my dear friends. Finally, I said enough to all the wavering and jumped into the abyss.</p>
        <p>July 1999: New York</p>
        <p>I came out on the other side of the black hole at Kennedy Airport and immediately felt I could breathe deeply again. I was back in a way of life I loved. I think we all dream of a time when we can start over in life, find some sense of completion and begin to understand our personal histories more completely. The first thing I learned at the Frankfurt Ballet was to take risks, so how could I even be worried about my future? The life of a freelance artist in New York would be great, without question. I could live my dream of being an artist like Anna Deavere Smith, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Laurie Anderson or Jenny Holzer, just sharing my ideas of truth with the world. So, with my six suitcases I danced my way through customs to the baggage claim.</p>
        <p>March 2000: Greenwich Village</p>
        <p>After living at home for a few months, I began to realize that life as a freelance artist would be more difficult than I thought. I choreographed a piece for the Ailey II company, which I loved doing, and then I realized I was without work. I auditioned for some workshops and started honing my skills as an actress and singer, but I had plenty to learn. It was difficult to change my focus from one art form to many. Now I was taking the same No. 6 train as an adult woman and felt almost like a stranger in my hometown. No one had time for a coffee; schedules were written in stone for survival. The saunas were unisex and all the women were weighing themselves and cursing the scale after jumping off. I smelled puritanism in the air.</p>
        <p>I became angry that so many amazing artists were not receiving the proper financing, while in Germany, many cities had a ballet company that was supported by the government and supplied its dancers with 13-month salaries. What was going on? Where was the money to commission a full evening of work like one I choreographed last year in Holland? I couldn't believe I had to start worrying and obsessing about the right outfit to wear to auditions to attract attention. Change can send you into a state of confusion. And I was already missing my artistic family and paid summer vacation.</p>
        <p>April 2000</p>
        <p>I started getting into the swing of things, seeing progress and enjoying change, walking the dog twice a day, taking my singing lessons, getting kept to the end of auditions, doing an Off Broadway workshop, choreographing pieces and trying out ideas I learned at the Frankfurt Ballet in my own choreography. I started feeling the spiritual rewards of expanding in different directions as an artist and a person. I could hear my voice improve, my imagination grow as an independent agent not linked to an institution. I started writing more, socializing with other artists and working with friends with similar dreams. I won the national choreographic competition for Hubbard Street Dance in Chicago. My fear of failure was turning into an urge for discovery, and I started to understand why my soul had needed this change. And why, at 31, I need to take the time to explore different arts forms and to begin to understand my personal history as a black woman.</p>
        <p>I still have moments when I miss the studio rituals with my dance colleagues, but I am learning a lot about responsibility and independence. It is important to give the spirit time to change on its own schedule and embrace its fragility. That is a gift I am thrilled to have given myself. I think all artists need time to recharge and recreate themselves. Some people say it happens naturally in seven-year cycles.</p>
