        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In the theater review '' 'Comedy of Errors' in New Rochelle,'' [July 16], the reviewer does your readers a disservice. Did he and I see the same play? At Saturday's performance of ''The Comedy of Errors,'' there were plenty of laughs, the audience clearly grasped the humor of mistaken identity, and no one ''packed up and left.''</p>
        <p>I saw a reasonably fine production of a light Shakespeare comedy. The actors got their lines across clearly. The exuberance of the actors Maura Molloy and Peter Galipeau and the zaniness of calypso energized the performance. At best there was a crazy, slapstick humor worthy of Jim Carrey, and at worst there was some confusion.</p>

        <p>Rather than upbraid Fleetwood Stage for ''budgetary constraints,'' your reviewer should praise the theater company for offering free Shakespeare to us in southern Westchester. The Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival in Garrison has been presenting outdoor Shakespeare for more years, with a bigger budget for actors, scenery, costumes and other effects, and for a fee. I would love to see Fleetwood Stage evolve in this direction. I urge readers to see ''The Comedy of Errors'' and not to be scared away by one nasty review.</p>
