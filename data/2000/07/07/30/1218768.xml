        <p>Councilman Anthony D Macagnone letter disagrees with Councilwoman Bonnie Eisler's call for moratorium on all building in Special Groundwater Protection Area in Oyster Bay, NY (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The state-designated Special Groundwater Protection Area, which covers much of the Town of Oyster Bay's north shore, has been getting a lot of attention, most recently with Councilwoman Bonnie Eisler's call for a moratorium on all building in the area. I disagree that a moratorium is needed.</p>
        <p>A moratorium over such a wide area would pose undue hardships on residents and business owners who seek to improve their properties. Growth is important to a stable economy, and stopping that growth could stagnate even a healthy economy.</p>

        <p>The state-designated Special Groundwater Protection Area, which covers much of the Town of Oyster Bay's north shore, has been getting a lot of attention, most recently with Councilwoman Bonnie Eisler's call for a moratorium on all building in the area. I disagree that a moratorium is needed.</p>
        <p>A moratorium over such a wide area would pose undue hardships on residents and business owners who seek to improve their properties. Growth is important to a stable economy, and stopping that growth could stagnate even a healthy economy.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the more important consideration is whether a moratorium is the best way to deal with development within the protected area. The area is already protected under the comprehensive review process the town has for all proposals for development, a process that balances environmental concerns with economic realities.</p>
        <p>The Division of Planning and Development reviews and studies the effects of land use to ensure orderly development.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Quality Review Commission reviews, analyzes and investigates all environmental impacts of applications submitted to or contemplated by the Town Board or other town agencies.</p>
        <p>A separate site-plan-review ordinance instituted in 1996 further strengthens the town's control and, in addition, ensures that these sites being developed are compatible with surrounding areas.</p>
        <p>In other words, a system of checks and balances is already in place.</p>
        <p>Having said this, it does not mean there is not room for change. The Town Board amends the code as necessary to reflect the changing needs of our society while protecting the way of life we all cherish.</p>
        <p>While it certainly may have the ring of ''political correctness,'' people who believe a moratorium is needed to halt development in the Special Groundwater Protection Area are not looking at the big picture. They say it will give the town time to implement a master plan and/or ground-water protection plan for development. What they fail to realize is that such a plan could take two to three years to develop and implement.</p>
        <p>The Town Board has an excellent record of maintaining the delicate balance needed for residential neighborhoods and businesses to co-exist in harmonious partnership. Continued responsible and orderly planning and development in our communities will help safeguard our town well into the 21st century and beyond.</p>
        <p>ANTHONY D. MACAGNONE  Councilman  Oyster Bay</p>
