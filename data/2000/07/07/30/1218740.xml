        <p>Unlike Bergdorf Goodman and Sephora, Takashimaya's new beauty emporium is not an ode to all things sleek and modern. The beauty aerie, which opened this month on the top floor of the Fifth Avenue department store, has a far more Zenlike approach to retail. David Mann of M.R. Architecture designed the space to look like an elegantly appointed lounge somewhere in the Far East. Poured concrete floors are raked to look like a Japanese Zen garden, or framed in marble and pressed with tatami mats. Spherical silver-leaf light fixtures are meant to recall the ripple effect of a stone thrown into a pond. Where are the products? Either out of view, shelved behind backlighted shoji-style screens, or discreetly displayed in and on antique furniture, which is itself for sale.</p>

        <p>While seated on oval leather banquettes, weary shoppers can take a load off their Manolo Blahniks and sip a cup of tea while a Takashimaya beauty director rounds up a selection of luxury products from around the world. The offerings include Bonnie Holmes skin care products from California, Shu Uemura lipstick shades exclusive to Takashimaya and Kanebo moisturizer from Japan. From Italy come Villa Borghini hair treatments, and from France, the Aquatonale spa skin care line and Jean d'Estrees sunscreen. Anyone unfamiliar with these brands will not have to settle for a sample on a Q-Tips swab. If a demonstration is required, the client can be whisked into a private room for an impromptu facial or scalp treatment -- free of charge.</p>
