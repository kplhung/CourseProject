        <p>Jerry Traunfeld learned to cook in the 70's, when the superego of science had eclipsed art in the American kitchen. Back then, recipes were king, with their exact measurements holding cruel reign over the cooking instinct and tyrannizing culinary experimentation. ''My mother kept all her powders and flakes in jars that were alphabetically arranged,'' the 40-year-old winner of this year's James Beard Award for best chef in the Northwest recalls disdainfully, ''and taught me to use them with the precision of a chemist -- as if precision equals alchemy.''</p>
        <p>Transcending his early training, Traunfeld developed a sensitive, fearless style of cooking that doesn't conform to written orders. His work, honed in the garden as much as in the kitchen, has been so successful at Herbfarm, a tiny restaurant in the foothills of the Cascades outside of Seattle, that seats are booked nearly a year in advance, and he has recently published ''The Herbfarm Cookbook.''</p>
        <p>Traunfeld arrived at Herbfarm in 1990 after graduating from the California Culinary Academy. At the time, the tiny restaurant was housed in a reclaimed garage, but its focus was as a commercial nursery, serving weekend meals to educate and inspire its customers. There were 13 acres planted with 600 types of herbs, and Traunfeld seized the opportunity to get to know the more obscure varieties.</p>
        <p>He discovered, for instance, that angelica, with its tastes of juniper, vanilla and celery, makes magic with rhubarb and that the astringent hyssop, with its camphor and thyme flavors, can bring out the nutty underpinnings in beans and imbue beef with the tart illusion of age.</p>
        <p>He parsed the lemony herbs -- lemon balm and lemon verbena -- finding that each makes a delicate partner with fish, carrots and beets, but that the more powerful verbena can, as well, be teamed with chilies and ginger or fruit. He learned to use meadowsweet flowers to make infusions for steeping cherries, peaches and figs, to deploy the mildly licorice-tasting sweet cicely as a counterpoint to fruit and to use scented geranium to give a bewitching hint of roses to chocolate.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more important than his knowledge of arcane herbs is how Traunfeld charted the moods of more common ones like basil and mint. As herbs became the basis of a cuisine rather than an afterthought, he developed an instinct for how they interact with basic ingredients, and with one another.</p>
        <p>''Growing the herbs, harvesting them, it all makes you respect the ingredients,'' he says in his carefully enunciated, almost nerdish manner, which provides a decided contrast to his rough gardener's hands. ''When you know the ingredients intimately, you handle them with so much more care.'' Eventually, just as knowledge and practice moved Traunfeld's cooking beyond recipes, it distilled his dishes to the spare essentials of flavor and feeling.</p>
        <p>Traunfeld does not advertise his expertise. He simply surprises us by matching lavender and rosemary with potatoes, for instance, which evokes the sweet scent of turned soil in a field. By roasting halibut or sea bass with a medley of boisterous cilantro, parsley and spearmint leaves, as well as with toasted ground coriander, he reminds us of the scent of beach scrub in a briny breeze. Using bruised, peppery basil to enhance the sweetness of a peach, he delivers the sense of summer heat and summer shade.</p>
        <p>While his book boasts clear recipes and his encyclopedic knowledge, Traunfeld's cooking does something even better: it creates the simple shock of matching a meal with a moment, of capturing times and places past.</p>
        <p>All recipes adapted from ''The HerbFarm Cookbook,'' by Jerry Traunfeld (Scribner)</p>
        <p>Grilled Peach Salad  For the peaches:  1 large jalapeno, seeded and finely chopped  2 tablespoons coarsely chopped basil leaves  1 tablespoon minced ginger  1 tablespoon lime juice</p>
        <p>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt  1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil  3 large peaches, quartered</p>
        <p>For the greens:</p>
        <p>1/2 bunch arugula, stemmed</p>
        <p>1/2 bunch watercress, stemmed  12 basil leaves, torn into  1/2-inch pieces  1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  1 tablespoon Champagne vinegar  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat a grill. In a bowl, stir together the jalapeno, basil, ginger, juice, salt and oil. Add the peaches and toss them with the mixture.</p>
        <p>2. Grill the peaches, skin side down, until well marked, about 2 minutes. Turn and continue grilling until just hot, about 30 seconds more. Transfer to a plate and set aside to cool slightly. Spoon the remaining mixture over the peaches.</p>
        <p>3. Make the greens. In a large bowl, toss together the arugula, watercress, basil, oil and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Arrange on a platter, top with the peaches and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Three-Fresh-Herb Tisane  3 4-inch sprigs lemon verbena  5 4-inch sprigs spearmint  1 2-inch sprig rosemary  3 cups boiling water.</p>
        <p>Place the herbs in a warmed teapot and pour in the boiling water. Cover and let steep for 5 to 10 minutes. Pour through a strainer into teacups and serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Snap Peas With Mint And Chervil  2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature  1 tablespoon salt  1 pound snap peas, stems snapped off  6 4-inch sprigs spearmint, tied together with kitchen twine</p>
        <p>1/2 cup coarsely snipped chervil.</p>
        <p>1. Put the butter in a large bowl and set aside in a warm place.</p>
        <p>2. In a large pot, combine the salt with 16 cups of water and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, remove and discard any strings from the peas. When the water boils, add the peas and mint and boil until crisp-tender, about 1 1/2 to 3 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Using a colander, drain the peas and let sit for 1 minute, allowing excess moisture to evaporate. Discard the mint, transfer peas to the bowl with the butter and toss. Sprinkle with chervil and serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Potatoes With Lavender And Rosemary  2 pounds Yellow Finn or Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered  6 lavender sprigs, plus 4 teaspoons finely chopped lavender buds (or substitute 3 teaspoons dried lavender buds)  3 tablespoons unsalted butter  2 teaspoons finely chopped rosemary  Kosher salt to taste.</p>
        <p>1. In a large saucepan, combine the potatoes and lavender sprigs (or 1 teaspoon dried lavender buds) and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until tender, 15 minutes. Drain.</p>
        <p>2. In a large skillet, over medium heat, heat the butter. Add the potatoes, chopped lavender (or remaining 2 teaspoons dried lavender buds) and rosemary and cook, tossing occasionally, until very hot, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt to taste and transfer to a serving platter. Serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Green-Roasted Fish Fillets</p>
        <p>1/2 cup cilantro leaves</p>
        <p>1/2 cup parsley leaves</p>
        <p>1/2 cup spearmint leaves  1 tablespoon ground coriander  2 green onions, coarsely chopped  2 cloves garlic  1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper  Zest of  1/2 lime</p>
        <p>1/4 cup lime juice  6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  4 8-ounce portions skinless fillet of sea bass or halibut.</p>
        <p>1. In a food processor, combine the cilantro, parsley, spearmint, coriander, green onion, garlic, salt and pepper, zest, juice and oil and pulse into a smooth puree.</p>
        <p>2. In a large nonreactive bowl, toss together the herb puree and fish until well coated. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature.</p>
        <p>3. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Transfer the fish to a shallow baking dish and space the portions apart. Spoon any remaining herb puree over the fish, place in the oven and bake until lightly browned and cooked through, about 7 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Cinnamon Basil Ice Cream  2 1/2 cups, plus 2 tablespoons, whole milk  1 1/2 cups heavy cream</p>
        <p>1/4 vanilla bean, or  1/2teaspoon vanilla extract  8 4-inch sprigs cinnamon basil, or 6 4-inch sprigs basil</p>
        <p>1/2 cinnamon stick (if using regular basil, use 1 1/2 cinnamon sticks)  1 cup, plus 2 tablespoons, granulated sugar  8 large egg yolks.</p>
        <p>1. In a large saucepan, combine the milk and cream and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, split the piece of vanilla bean with a paring knife and scrape the seeds into the milk. (If using the extract, it will be added later.) When it comes to a boil, stir in the basil and cinnamon stick and remove from the heat. Set aside, covered, to steep for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Using a sieve over a large liquid measuring cup, strain the milk mixture and press firmly down on the solids to extract any remaining liquid. Discard the solids. Add enough of the remaining milk to the mixture to make 4 cups total. Return the mixture to the saucepan with the sugar and set aside.</p>
        <p>3. In a medium-size stainless-steel bowl set into a larger bowl half full of hot tap water, place the yolks and whisk rapidly until lukewarm (about 90 degrees). Lift the bowl out of the water and place into a medium-size saucepan covered with a kitchen towel to hold steady. Bring the milk mixture to a boil and immediately remove from the heat. While whisking the yolks constantly, slowly drizzle in the milk mixture until fully incorporated. Continue whisking for 1 minute more. (The mixture should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.) If using the vanilla extract, whisk it in now. Using a fine sieve over a large bowl, strain the mixture and refrigerate until cold.</p>
        <p>4. Freeze in an ice-cream maker according to its directions.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 1/2 quarts.</p>
