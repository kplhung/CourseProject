        <p>THE FOUNTAINS OF YOUTH (Tor/Tom Doherty, $24.95), by Brian Stableford, purports to be the true story behind Mortimer Gray's monumental work of scholarship, ''The History of Death.''

        <p>THE FOUNTAINS OF YOUTH (Tor/Tom Doherty, $24.95), by Brian Stableford, purports to be the true story behind Mortimer Gray's monumental work of scholarship, ''The History of Death.'' Written by the famous historian himself, it answers pressing questions like: Why did Gray begin writing death's obituary? Why did he take five centuries to finish it? And what is he doing for an encore?</p>
        <p>Born in 2520, Gray grew up in the first generation to enjoy the benefits of ''emortality.'' This is not the fairy-tale dream of living forever (which would require an impossible immunity from ''accident or misadventure''). While an emortal's body continually renews itself against damage, disease and decay, there are limits -- which Gray seems doomed, or determined, to explore.</p>
        <p>Stableford understands that avoiding boredom will be one of the principal challenges of long life. ''The Fountains of Youth'' alternates between scenes from Gray's life, often involving a near-fatal encounter with earthquake, avalanche, tsunami or terrorist, and long synopses from all 10 volumes of ''The History of Death.'' At no time does the historian slip out of character. Despite his many close calls, he is a man of words, not action. Whether expounding on humanity's history or his own, he uses language that is always precise and distanced: ''Although we had formed our marriage for general purposes of companionship rather than preparing for parenthood, we didn't go in for overmuch fleshsex in the early years.''</p>
        <p>Gray's thesis is that from the ancient pyramids onward, fear of death has been the main engine of social evolution. When medical advances silence that engine, some emortals embark on centuries-long projects of tortuous complexity, from works of daunting scholarship to the creation of new art forms on a planetary scale. Others defy mortal danger on Earth or in space, while still others court hedonism or suicide -- until an unforeseen development shifts the focus from self-involvement to self-defense against a new and terrible enemy. This is cerebral science fiction of a high order, dry to a fault but with ample rewards for readers willing to stay the course.</p>
        <p>DARK MATTER (Aspect/Warner, $24.95), edited by Sheree R. Thomas, is subtitled ''A Century of Speculative Fiction From the African Diaspora.'' Some of the stories in this generous anthology are new; some are science fiction classics, like ''Aye, and Gomorrah . . . ,'' by Samuel R. Delany, and ''The Evening and the Morning and the Night,'' by Octavia E. Butler; a few are long-forgotten curiosities, like ''The Comet'' (1920), by W. E. B. Du Bois, and George S. Schuyler's 1931 novel, ''Black No More,'' from which Thomas provides an excerpt.</p>
        <p>I can imagine two distinct audiences for this book: readers interested in science fiction and readers interested in fiction by black writers. The handful of early works will hold few revelations for either group, although the more historically minded may look for parallels between Du Bois's sweetly ironic vision of racism confounded by cosmic catastrophe and Ray Bradbury's white-liberal fantasy of racial liberation by technology, ''Way in the Middle of the Air,'' from ''The Martian Chronicles'' (1950).</p>
        <p>It is the clear if unspoken thesis of this collection that writers like Delany and Butler, major figures in modern science fiction, should also be recognized as major black writers. Their stories reprinted here were not seen as dealing with race when they were first published, in 1967 and 1987, respectively. While both tell of marginalized populations struggling for a place in society, neither Delany's desexualized ''Spacers'' nor Butler's self-mutilating victims of a devastating new disease can be reduced to symbols of racism. Yet, as suggested in Thomas's brief introduction, these stories undeniably gain in resonance when viewed in the context of Ralph Ellison's ''Invisible Man.''</p>
        <p>The bold new voice of Nalo Hopkinson is represented by two stories. Like her recent novels, ''Brown Girl in the Ring'' and ''Midnight Robber,'' they are not only set in black communities, they make use of West African-derived folklore and language patterns to create fresh worlds and emotionally compelling situations. Many of the other previously unpublished stories in the anthology share Hopkinson's approach; there is nothing invisible about their characters or their focus on the past, present and future of the African diaspora. All the writers gathered here have discovered the freedom inherent in ''speculative fiction.'' Readers of all persuasions will find common ground in this discovery.</p>
        <p>A subgenre of science fiction deals with what aficionados refer to fondly as Big Dumb Objects. The best-known example is Arthur C. Clarke's ''Rendezvous With Rama,'' Rama being a huge spaceship of unknown provenance that passes through the solar system without divulging its purpose to the humans who dare to explore its vast interior.</p>
        <p>Robert Reed's MARROW (Tor/Tom Doherty, $25.95) poses the same puzzle on an even grander scale. Far in the future, when humans and other species have mastered interstellar travel, a mysterious ship the size of ''20 Earth masses'' enters the Milky Way from the trackless reaches of intergalactic space. Humans colonize it, learn to control it up to a point, then invite other species to travel on it as paying passengers. The ship circles the galaxy as a kind of ark, taking on and letting off entire populations of travelers. Then, a startling discovery: the very center of the ship, long thought to be a solid mass of metal, turns out to be a hollow shell, containing a Mars-sized world with a breathable atmosphere. The Master Captain names this world Marrow and dispatches her most trusted lieutenants to probe its secrets.</p>
        <p>What follows is an adventure combining futuristic superscience and communal strife roiled by religious prophecies and personal ambitions. Reed orchestrates the complex plot and large cast of characters with great assurance. His Big Dumb Object differs from most in that it has a voice -- which is apparently audible only to the reader. But since the ship does not understand its own origins or destiny, its monologue cannot spoil the suspense. This is not a book for readers who like their loose ends neatly tied and their puzzles solved. Reed's narrative strategy is more like peeling an onion: beneath each hard-won resolution lies layer upon layer of new mystery. You may not know where you are going, or even where you are when you arrive, but it's an exhilarating ride, in the hands of an author whose aspiration literally knows no bounds.</p>
