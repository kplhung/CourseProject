        <p>SUNMAID makes raisins from the grapes grown on the 40-acre farm in Fowler, Calif., where John G. Goode grew up. Mr. Goode, who still owns the farm, also runs the $2.55 billion Smith Barney Fundamental Value fund -- and he says managing its portfolio is much like farming.</p>
        <p>''You plant the fields and hope you get a good crop,'' Mr. Goode said from his San Francisco office, which has a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. ''But you have to keep the field tended and spend time cutting down the weeds.''</p>
        <p>His careful management has yielded a bounty for shareholders. The fund returned 19.92 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with 7.28 percent for large-capitalization value funds in general and 17.2 percent for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goode, 55, looks for fallen stars among companies. ''We're picking the leading franchises when share prices are depressed for reasons that we think are temporary,'' he said. ''We find that even the best and brightest companies get involved in circumstances, such as product recalls, that make shares available at extremely attractive prices.''</p>
        <p>But a cheap price isn't enough; he wants to see a catalyst that will push  a stock back up. ''We try to pick rubber balls,'' he said, ''not broken eggs.''</p>
        <p>He uses two computerized screens to whittle down the universe of roughly 10,000 publicly traded domestic stocks: One looks for excess cash flow over the past five years, while the other seeks high returns on  the company's cost of capital. A few hundred companies qualify.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goode then works with five analysts to select the 75 or so stocks that fit the themes and trends that they believe will be important over the next three to five years. The fund is now dominated by the market's biggest stocks, but he expects that to change.</p>
        <p>''Our work suggests that smaller and mid-cap stocks will dominate the big S.&amp; P. 500 stocks in the future,'' he said. Among the S.&amp; P. 500 itself, he expects that ''the not-so-nifty 450  will be much more attractive than the cult stocks'' near the top of the list.</p>
        <p>As inflation increases moderately, he is also moving toward hard-asset stocks like natural-resource companies. In that group, he especially likes Alcoa, one of the fund's top five holdings, because it is an efficiently run industry leader, he said.</p>
        <p>He sees revived pricing power in many other old-economy stocks. ''We're seeing higher prices for landfills, office space, electricity and natural gas,'' he said. ''It will probably be a cyclical phenomenon, but it'll be a beauty over the next one to three years.''</p>
        <p>He spends about one-quarter of his time talking to company managers to gauge their acumen and their attitudes toward shareholders.</p>
        <p>His valuation formulas vary by industry group, but Mr. Goode generally tends to buy shares when prices fall 20 to 40 percent from their 90-day moving average. When the price jumps far above that average or company insiders step up their selling sharply, he starts paring his position. Over all, the fund's turnover is a low 40 percent a year.</p>
        <p>MR. GOODE regards Abbott Laboratories, the pharmaceutical company, as ''the poor man's human genome play'' because it specializes in drug-testing work, which will be required for new therapies emerging from genome research. Abbott's stock price is depressed, he said, because of concerns earlier this year that drug companies' growth rates were slipping. He added that the company's planned merger with Alza, the drug delivery company, ''didn't happen, and that left a bad taste in investors' mouths.''</p>
        <p>The fund bought Abbott shares in January at $29.875; they now trade at $41.50, or 20.75 times Wall Street's  earnings estimate of $2 a share for 2001. He expects Abbott's earnings to grow 13 percent a year through 2002.</p>
        <p>About the same time, Mr. Goode  bought shares of McKesson HBOC, the drug distributor. ''We think the drug distribution business will be very attractive going forward,'' he said. ''If you listen to Al Gore, more of the population will be covered, and drug distribution is one way to play that trend.''</p>
        <p>Wider use of generic drugs, which generate bigger profits for distributors than name-brand drugs do, will also help McKesson, he said, and he expects earnings to grow 15 percent a year for the next three years. The stock looked like a bargain, he said, after investors reacted sourly to a merger with HBO &amp; Company last year, pushing down the price from $90 to less than $20 this spring.</p>
        <p>The fund bought shares for $20.43; they now trade at $24.4375, or 18.79 times the consensus 2001 earnings estimate of $1.30 a share.</p>
        <p>Another favorite is Countrywide Credit, the mortgage origination and servicing company. Mr. Goode called the stock an e-commerce play because the company does one-fifth of its business over the Internet. Interest-rate worries pushed down its stock price from $50 in early 1999 to the mid-$20's early this year; he got in for $24.99 a share in January. He noted investors' concern that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, ''would tighten the screws in the economy, meaning that loan originators would be penalized as interest rates rose.'' But Countrywide's loan servicing business stood to benefit, he added, because higher rates would discourage homeowners from refinancing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goode expects Countrywide's earnings to grow 15 percent a year over three years. The stock now trades at $35.6875, or 10.1 times the consensus earnings estimate of $3.54 a share for 2001.</p>
