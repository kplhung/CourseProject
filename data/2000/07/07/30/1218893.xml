        <p>It was a typically foggy morning recently in Bodega Bay, a fishing village along Highway 1 on the Northern California coast.</p>
        <p>The water was 52 degrees and you could see your breath. A sign at the Bodega Dunes Campground beach warned of dangerous undertow, rocks and sharks. ''Surfing Unsafe,'' it read. ''No Lifeguard On Duty.''</p>
        <p>The only ones in the water were the seals and the sea lions -- and, of course, Dale Webster. Wearing a wetsuit with hood, boots and gloves, he had been riding waves for a good two hours and now sat straddling his board, surveying the swells rolling steadily toward him.</p>
        <p>Then, there was his wave. He leaned back and deftly pivoted his board around. He gave a couple of quick paddles and sprang to his feet. Sliding down the face of the glassy four-foot wave, he began dancing on it with the grace of Fred Astaire and rode it smack onto the beach.</p>
        <p>Some beachcombers in jeans and windbreakers stared, but it was just another day of surfing for Webster -- actually, his 9,067th consecutive day of surfing, to be precise.</p>
        <p>Webster, 51, has surfed every day since Sept. 2, 1975. It all started, he said, when Bodega Bay was pounded with 15-foot waves for a week straight.</p>
        <p>''I surfed all seven days,'' he said, ''and then I thought, 'Let me see if I can keep this going.' ''</p>
        <p>And 25 years later, he's still going. As of yesterday, the streak had reached 9,097. Webster intends on continuing the streak until he completes a 28-year lunar cycle, surfing the tides caused by the moon in all its calendar phases. He will not be happy, he said, until he can reuse his original 1976 tide chart book in February 2004, when the days of the week will fall on the same calendar dates as they did in 1976.</p>
        <p>Other quirky personal goals and theories help fuel his streak. For example, 1976 was a leap year in which February had five Sundays. He surfed each of them and hung five -- draped five toes over the front of the board's nose -- on the final Sunday,  Feb. 29.</p>
        <p>''I plan on hanging five again on Feb. 29, 2004,'' he said. ''That's called hanging 10 the hard way. Then I'll be the hyperbole Sunday surfer.''</p>
        <p>As far as daily surfing streaks go, Webster is in a class of his own, said Drew Kampion, a former editor at both Surfer and Surfing magazines.</p>
        <p>''Dale Webster -- actually, we call him Daily Wavester -- has a whole different concept of longevity,'' said Kampion, the author of ''Stoked: A History of Surf Culture'' (1997, General Publishing Group). ''I mean, surfing for a lunar cycle, no one's ever even come close to that. It's just so far out there.''</p>
        <p>Local surfers here wear wet suits five millimeters thick year-round. At the beginning of his streak, Webster bought an O'Neill wet suit with a one-year warranty. Thereafter, every Sept. 2, he traded in his suit, worn out from daily use, for a new one.</p>
        <p>After 14 years of this, the company decided to give Webster wet suits free, because he was such an advertisement for their durability. And Webster caused the company to add a ''10,000-wave clause'' to its warranty, a maximum-use caveat prohibiting exchanges for all suits subjected to unusually intense use. Dozens of shredded wet suits hang in Webster's shed at home, a testament in tattered neoprene to his streak.</p>
        <p>Webster himself, however, is anything but worn out. He has a broad back, long stringy blond hair and piercing blue eyes that focus on the horizon when he speaks.</p>
        <p>He grew up surfing in San Diego and moved in 1973 to Bodega Bay, which is 75 minutes north of San Francisco (Alfred Hitchcock filmed most of ''The Birds'' there). He now lives in Valley Ford (pop. 126), a dairy community near Bodega Bay. He works as a custodian at Bodega Bay Elementary School, with a clear view of the ocean from the parking lot where he parks his 1981 Toyota Corolla.</p>
        <p>For the first 10 years of his streak, Webster would ask witnesses -- surfers, beachgoers, park rangers -- to sign his log book to verify that they saw him surfing. His wife, Kaye, his frequent surfing partner until she injured her knee in 1995, also kept a diary. But often elements like storms or fog made witnesses scarce. Sometimes people refused to sign, bewildered by the request.</p>
        <p>His requirement for a daily surf session means riding at least three waves regardless of height. His norm is about 20 waves in roughly two hours. But some days, the weather can be brutal or the waves almost nonexistent.</p>
        <p>Deterrents include the water temperature, which ranges from 48 to 58 degrees. Surfers have been killed by waves and sharks in the area, and Webster said he once crossed paths with a 20-foot great white.</p>
        <p>He has paddled out in hurricane force winds and surfed with illnesses of all kinds, including the flu, sprains, cuts and earaches. Once a kidney stone attack left him barely able to walk. His wife carried his board, he surfed three waves and was then taken to the hospital directly afterward. ''I had to crawl on the beach,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The surfing part was difficult enough, said Webster, who for years had little money and no car. He relied on his wife, friends, or else his thumb, to get to the beach. He supported his surfing addiction with dozens of different menial jobs, quitting them when they interfered with his surf sessions.</p>
        <p>And nothing interferes with his surf sessions. Not family. Not geography. Not travel or vacations or dark of night.</p>
        <p>Since he cannot take vacations inland, he has never visited the in-laws in Utah.</p>
        <p>When flying, he insists upon surfing beforehand. Once, on a trip to Hawaii, he arrived on the Big Island of Hawaii in late afternoon and found the water completely flat on the Kona coast. So he raced back to the east coast and found some waves just before dark.</p>
        <p>''I think of all the things I'll have missed in life because of this,'' he said. ''The only thing I'll have is the memory of riding all those waves. When I'm out there watching the seals and sea lions, and 30-inch salmon jumping, and I have all those waves to myself, it's like my own personal Disneyland.''</p>
        <p>For surfers, Bodega Bay is Disneyland. The coastline there gets consistent surf because it is exposed to ocean swells from all directions, said Kampion, the editor and author who speaks of Webster like a zen figure.</p>
        <p>''He's this passionate, inspired guy who was looking for an aim and a goal in his life and struck upon this,'' Kampion said. Then, quoting the poet William Blake, he added: ''If a fool persists in his folly, he can become wise. And this is making him a wise man.''</p>
        <p>Also, his consistency inspires others around him. His daughter Margo is entering the ninth grade and has never missed a day of school.</p>
        <p>Margo, 13, has been surfing since she was 3, she said, standing next to her dad recently.</p>
        <p>''But not every day,'' she added looking down sheepishly at her sneakers.</p>
