        <p>MAYOR JOHN D. SPENCER likes to tell people that his favorite movie is ''Braveheart,'' the Mel Gibson epic about medieval Scotland.</p>
        <p>He identifies with the Scottish rebel's struggle to be free of English rule, said the blunt-spoken mayor, a Vietnam combat veteran who began his career as a brawling, hard-drinking construction worker before moving on to real estate management and politics.</p>
        <p>And in case it isn't clear, he spells out the analogy: Mr. Spencer's overriding ambition since he was first elected in 1995 has been to free his city of the federal desegregation lawsuit that has dogged it for 15 years, earning Yonkers a reputation as a haven for racists.</p>
        <p>Until a few months ago, Mr. Spencer seemed on the brink of success. A new schools superintendent had raised minority test scores in the schools. The city's perennially fractious government seemed unified, its finances at last under control.</p>
        <p>A law-and-order Republican in the mold of Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Spencer, 53, has enjoyed broad Democratic support and brought a measure of peace to this largely blue-collar city of 188,000, the state's fourth largest.</p>
        <p>But recently the mayor's patience appears to have run out.</p>
        <p>''It's like the emperor has no clothes, and someone has to say it,'' Mr. Spencer said of the federal case in which Judge Leonard B. Sand found Yonkers guilty of willfully segregating its public housing and schools. ''The federal government has come in here since 1985, and they've failed.''</p>
        <p>The mayor, a Yonkers native, seems to take personal offense at the judge's claim that the ''vestiges of segregation'' have caused a gap between white and minority test scores.</p>
        <p>''No. 1, it's not true,'' said the mayor testily in his City Hall office. ''It's the United States of America. We put a ton of resources into the education system. There are no racial problems. And I think Johnny needs to be told a different message: that you can achieve, I don't care where you come from.''</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Spencer has embarked on a final charge to force the court and the state to the table to settle the education case. It is a risky strategy. And so far, it appears to have backfired, reviving some of the divisions that led the court to intervene initially.</p>
        <p>In May Mr. Spencer proposed a budget that fell far short of the school board's request. That provoked a fierce dispute with the schools superintendent, Dr. Andre J. Hornsby. A month later, the school board fired Dr. Hornsby at the mayor's request.</p>
        <p>At the school board's meeting, several local N.A.A.C.P. members and clergymen interrupted to protest the firing of Dr. Hornsby, who is black, and who had just announced landmark improvements in the test scores of Yonkers students. They were arrested for disorderly conduct. At their trial, which is slated for Aug. 7, they plan to call Mayor Spencer and school board members as witnesses.</p>
        <p>The protesters, along with several dissenting members of the school board, say the mayor's proposed budget proves he does not care about the black and Hispanic children who now constitute more than 70 percent of the district's 26,000 students. They have called for the state and the federal court to intervene and force the city to provide adequate financing for its schools.</p>
        <p>The mayor counters that the budget shortfall should be remedied by the state, which successfully appealed its obligation to pay for some of the city's court-ordered programs last year. That left the programs intended to lift minority achievement in a state of legal and financial uncertainty.</p>
        <p>In May the mayor sent a letter to Yonkers residents -- quickly forwarded to Albany -- in which he said pointedly: ''I will continue to press the governor and our legislators to save Yonkers from a bad budget that only they can prevent from happening.''</p>
        <p>That tactic has enraged state legislators, who say they have given Yonkers record increases in aid for several years running. Mr. Spencer said Gov. George E. Pataki, a political ally who has helped him frequently in the past, called him to express his annoyance.</p>
        <p>The dispute has triggered accusations that the mayor has mismanaged his budget, which includes a large property tax increase and City Hall layoffs. And it has fueled speculation that the mayor, who has often been mentioned as a possible candidate for county executive in 2001 against Andrew J. Spano, has burned his chances of attaining higher office.</p>
        <p>It has also surprised some former allies, who seem dumbfounded by the mayor's willingness to risk a return to the bad old days of the late 80's, when protestors affixed bumper stickers to their heads and City Council members endured contempt fines rather than build public housing ordered by Judge Sand.</p>
        <p>''This is not the same John Spencer I knew in November,'' said Maria Chiulli, the vice president of the school board. Mr. Spencer appointed Ms. Chiulli in May 1999, but called for her resignation this month after she urged the state and the federal court to intervene.</p>
        <p>But others say Mr. Spencer has always been autocratic, and the crisis has simply brought his character into relief. Ken Jenkins, a former president of the Yonkers N.A.A.C.P., recalled confronting Mr. Spencer several years ago with a suggestion that he appoint a blue-ribbon panel to help select school board members.</p>
        <p>''I am the mayor,'' Mr. Spencer replied. ''I am the blue-ribbon panel.''</p>
        <p>That willfulness stems partly from his virtual monopoly on political power in the city. ''John Spencer has very little opposition to almost anything he does,'' said Robert Stauf, a Democratic ward leader and president of the Southwest Yonkers Police Community Council. He is widely supported by Democrats and has the nearly total backing of the City Council.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Spencer's friends and enemies also grant that intransigence is part of his nature. Like Mayor Giuliani, Mr. Spencer identifies himself completely with his city, and can be ferocious to those who cross him.</p>
        <p>''He really believes that he is a white knight -- that he does things for good and wholesome reasons, and others are political hacks out to feather their own nests,'' Mr. Stauf said.</p>
        <p>Several of Mr. Spencer's supporters said his identification with Yonkers comes from a conviction that he has lived its problems more deeply than others have.</p>
        <p>Born in 1946, Mr. Spencer was given up for adoption by his parents and taken in by a working-class couple in north Yonkers who already had eight children of their own. His foster mother died when he was 8, his foster father six years later.</p>
        <p>His youth coincided with the decline of Yonkers as a manufacturing town. As the Alexander Smith Carpet Company and other companies left in the 1950's and 60's, the city began a slow descent.</p>
        <p>In 1966, Mr. Spencer joined the Army and served in Vietnam, where he led a platoon and was awarded the Bronze Star for combat service. On his return, he flirted briefly with college, then left to become a construction worker. In 1971 he married Eileen Looney, and the couple had two children, Jennifer and John.</p>
        <p>It was then that he began having problems with alcohol. In the early 1970's, he said, he was arrested twice, once for fighting with a police officer while drunk, Finally, Mr. Spencer joined Alcoholics Anonymous, becoming sober in 1976.</p>
        <p>''I'm grateful to be here, to be alive,'' the mayor said. His gratitude to those who helped rescue him from addiction, he said, inspired his interest in public service.</p>
        <p>Sobriety also boosted Mr. Spencer's career. At the suggestion of a friend, he went to night school in Brooklyn, taking classes in engineering and building management, and landed a job as a property manager at Cushman &amp; Wakefield. He eventually became a vice president of real estate management for Bankers Trust, leaving in 1991 to start his own building services management concern.</p>
        <p>He was first elected to the City Council in 1990, siding with those who favored compliance with Judge Sand's desegregation order. He became mayor in 1995.</p>
        <p>''I thought John Spencer brought a breath of hope to the city when he became mayor,'' said the Rev. Luther Evans of the Community Memorial Baptist Church, who is now one of the mayor's most visible opponents.</p>
        <p>Unlike his predecessor, Terence Zaleski, a Democrat, Mr. Spencer had a generally supportive City Council. As Council majority leader under the previous administration, Mr. Spencer had himself led nearly constant opposition to Mr. Zaleski's initiatives, earning the nickname Negative John.</p>
        <p>Moreover, a revision of the city charter had granted more power to the mayor, enhancing Mr. Spencer's ability to triumph over the city's long tradition of balkanized ward politics.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Spencer's enemies say he has won back respect for the city. He enacted tough graffiti laws, including fines on any business that failed to remove graffiti within 48 hours. City services have improved, and crime is down.</p>
        <p>He has also cut taxes and attracted new businesses, including the Stew Leonard's supermarket, and he has continued work begun by his predecessor on developing the waterfront.</p>
        <p>The mayor brought the city toward financial independence in 1998 when he persuaded the state to remove the financial control board, which was brought in because of the city's poor management practices in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>And in a first for Yonkers, Mr. Spencer sat down with Judge Sand and promised to comply with the federal order to provide affordable housing so long as he could control the process for renovating and allocating the houses. The judge agreed, and the federal office that had directed the city's housing program closed its doors.</p>
        <p>In November 1999, Mr. Spencer won re-election in a landslide.</p>
        <p>But not everyone was charmed. After an initial period of good will, Michael Sussman, the N.A.A.C.P. lawyer who helped to bring the desegregation case along with the Justice Department back in 1980, complained to Judge Sand that the mayor's housing plan was inadequate. Although 70 percent of its beneficiaries were minorities, the plan subsidized the moves of some blacks into black neighborhoods and whites to white neighborhoods, failing to serve the purpose of racial integration.</p>
        <p>The judge agreed, and accordingly changed the plan. That angered Mr. Spencer, who labeled the judge's modified plan a ''quota'' system. Since then the program has fallen far behind schedule, and Mr. Sussman has repeatedly expressed his exasperation with the mayor.</p>
        <p>Moreover, many black politicians take issue with the mayor's claim that the city has integrated naturally over the years and that the desegregation case is no longer relevant. ''One need only walk around Yonkers to see that it is not true,'' said Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democratic county legislator.</p>
        <p>Other blacks said the mayor seems insensitive to their concerns. ''I have yet to see this mayor attend an African-American function or come to an African-American church,'' said Herman Keith, a former Yonkers N.A.A.C.P. president, who said he got along well with Mr. Spencer initially.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Spencer said he has spoken at black church and recently marched in the African-American Day parade.</p>
        <p>The mayor also drew fire in April when he named Charles Cola, the president of the Patrolman's Benevolent Association, as police commissioner. One former Yonkers police official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said it was unheard of to shift a labor leader into a top management slot.</p>
        <p>The fact that the P.B.A. has been a strong supporter of Mr. Spencer allowed the impression that Mr. Cola's position might have been a reward for political assistance. ''It smelled really bad,'' said Mr. Jenkins, the former N.A.A.C.P. president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spencer denied that there was anything improper about the appointment. ''I appointed him based on his ability to lead, his managerial skills and his knowledge of the police department,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Former Mayor Angelo Martinelli, a friend and supporter, remarked, ''John doesn't reach out very far, but he reaches out to people he feels are qualified, and a lot of them are his friends.''</p>
        <p>In addition, the city's law department hired Mr. Spencer's son, a law student at Pace University, this spring.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spencer said his son only worked part time for the city, for about two months. He said the incident was misreported in the local press.</p>
        <p>''I despise the media, because they're corrupt,'' he said angrily. Mr. Spencer has refused at various points to speak to the local newspaper, The Journal News, and the local television station.</p>
        <p>Still, the mayor encountered few real obstacles until this spring, when he came into conflict with Schools Superintendent Hornsby.</p>
        <p>Many Yonkers teachers and parents said the city was well rid of the high-handed Dr. Hornsby. Although some measures of student performance have risen, Dr. Hornsby provoked a strike last fall after he insisted on changes to teachers' schedules, including a doubling of the standard 45-minute high school class to 90 minutes.</p>
        <p>''It was his style,'' said Mr. Spencer, when asked why he pressured the school board to fire Dr. Hornsby. ''And it was him turning around and saying to me, the politicians and the City Council of Yonkers that we didn't care about education.''</p>
        <p>But on the broader issue of school financing, many agreed with Dr. Hornsby, who wanted to pursue state funds for the court-ordered desegregation plan. The plan, which was overturned by an appeals court last year and was later sent back to Judge Sand for review, would require the state and Yonkers each to pay $575 million over nine years to remedy educational disparities.</p>
        <p>''Dr. Hornsby realized what previous superintendents have realized -- that the only way to get money from the state is via the federal courts,'' said Joseph Pastore, the court-appointed monitor for the education element of the desegregation case.</p>
        <p>But to pursue the plan, the city would have had to concede the judge's argument that its schools still suffer from ''vestiges of segregation.'' On that point Mr. Spencer was adamant. He urged the school board not to pursue the appeal, and it complied -- despite the protests of several members.</p>
        <p>Those members now say the mayor has allowed municipal finances to balloon out of control, threatening the school budget. ''The mayor and the City Council have made this problem entirely the school board's to solve,'' said Ellis Cousens, a board member.</p>
        <p>In addition to the school financing shortfall, the mayor's budget includes City Hall layoffs and a property tax increase of 9.6 percent -- an average of $427 a year.</p>
        <p>The city has added 123 workers over the past four years, about half of them police officers, said Personnel Commissioner Ernest F. Hart. And the salaries of top management have risen by more than 20 percent. But the mayor denied that he had overspent, saying that higher salaries were necessary to attract qualified workers. Most of the 6 percent increase in this year's city budget, he said, was driven by retirement costs, which he does not control.</p>
        <p>Above all, the mayor blames the state for the budget shortfall, saying it employs an outdated formula that denies Yonkers its fair share of education funds.</p>
        <p>Several state legislators, however, said Mr. Spencer is blaming them for his own budgetary problems.</p>
        <p>John Flanagan, the ranking Republican on the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, took to the Assembly floor on June 15 to deliver an angry rebuttal to Mr. Spencer's charges, telling the mayor to ''stop complaining'' and saying that Yonkers has received record increases in aid for several years.</p>
        <p>The controversy has fueled speculation that Mr. Spencer has seriously harmed his chances for higher office.</p>
        <p>John Jacono, the president of the Yonkers Republican Party, said of Mayor Spencer, ''I've heard from a lot of upcounty people that he has too many negatives for them to consider him now.''</p>
        <p>As for the mayor, who is barred by law from seeking a third term, he insists he is not worried about his future. ''I am accountable to the citizens of Yonkers, period,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even his opponents grant that Mr. Spencer's actions flow from a genuine love for his city. But many wonder whether his obsession with winning independence for Yonkers has not blinded him to the reason that the court came in in the first place.</p>
        <p>''After all the acrimony is over, you've got to keep your eyes on the bigger prize, which is not only to get out from under the court order but to create a healing of the reality -- and the perception -- that plagues this city,'' Ms. Stewart-Cousins said. ''That's where he missed his opportunity.''</p>
