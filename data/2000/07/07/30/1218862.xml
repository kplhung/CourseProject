        <p>AT this summer's political party gatherings, where the outcomes are preordained, the hottest activity may be interactivity. For the Republican National Convention this week, for example, Chris Long wants to put you in the director's seat. On C-SPAN's Web site, run by Mr. Long, users will be able to click on one of several distinct video feeds from the convention hall, or even choose to watch the action from the vantage point of the C-SPAN control booth.</p>
        <p>C-SPAN is one of several operations using similar technology at the conventions. In each case, their U-pick-em-style camera angles takes the editor out of the equation and put the accent in media on the ''me.''</p>
        <p>''They allow users to have different experiences of the same event,'' Mr. Long said.</p>
        <p>In other words, the nation's armchair politicos can now begin to create their own show.</p>
        <p>Customized political conventions are just one example of the nation's growing, technologically abetted obsession with getting what you want when you want. From sites that download music onto personalized players, to digital television services that rearrange prime-time offerings to fit viewers' schedules, electronic wizardry is constantly expanding the possibilities for satisfying consumer demand for individualization.</p>
        <p>It's one thing, though, to go online to order a pair of jeans tailored to specifications for ankle width and button color, and quite another to design one's own idea of a political convention. The quadrennial events, with their idiosyncratic procedures and highly scripted programs, are at heart communal exercises for both the participants and the audience. So what happens to the shared national experience when no two members of the audience share the same convention, or, by logical extension, the same election-day coverage?</p>
        <p>Some media observers, like Russell Newman, a researcher on Internet issues at the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, are not convinced customized camera angles are anything but Webfoolery.</p>
        <p>''My estimate of the audience for a bird's eye view of the top of the convention dome,'' Mr. Newman said, ''is seven people.''</p>
        <p>But if this initial stab at a Web-enabled convention doesn't work, that will hardly spell its death. In fact, the Internet, a technology that is inherently individualistic and interactive, is rapidly growing in prominence in the political process. Candidate Web sites are getting better, Internet fund-raising and voter communications are growing more sophisticated and effective, and many people think the advent of voting via the Web is only a matter of time.</p>
        <p>The water cooler has long played a significant role in the nation's political conversation. Indeed, part of the enjoyment of watching conventions is the post-mortem critiquing of the politicians and the anchors and the conventioneers in the silly hats. But who is going to shoot the breeze with friends if one spent the night before in a chat room, exploring tobacco policy with lobbyists from Kentucky, another was transfixed by a camera trained on the Hawaii delegation, a third was consumed with e-mailing questions to a Webcast on MSNBC -- and none paid attention to a word of the vice presidential nominee's address?</p>
        <p>W ITH more options, your water-cooler conversations are going to be many times smaller,'' said Sam Hollander, executive producer of Pseudopolitics.com, a Web site that will, among other things, provide a 360-degree view through a series of cameras inside the First Union Center in Philadelphia and the Staples Center in Los Angeles, where the Democrats convene next month. ''There will be a lot of two-person conversations, rather than 20-person conversations.''</p>
        <p>This relentless subdividing of common ground, Mr. Hollander said, is akin to the fragmenting of television viewership, thanks to the multiplicity of choices on cable.</p>
        <p>''All you need to do is look at what ratings share a network has to get today to have a success,'' he said. ''There was a time when if you didn't get a 30 share, it wasn't that big. Now, if you get a 20, you're a huge hit.''</p>
        <p>Where once the country was knit together by the collective experience of watching the same sitcom on one of the networks, or having the meaning of a national tragedy  interpreted by Walter Cronkite, the I-can-do-it-myself ethos engendered by technology is on the verge of assuring that there will be no collective electronic experience.</p>
        <p>TiVo, for example, is a year-old digital service based in California that allows subscribers to program their televisions to play only what they want to see at a time of their choosing. Its recent television commercial depicting network programmers being tossed out of windows asked , ''When you've got TiVo, who needs them?'' Some networks refused to run it, say TiVo executives.</p>
        <p>No one as yet is confidently predicting just how all this electronic democracy will affect the democratic process. Paul Sagan, president of Akamai Technologies, an Internet company selected by the Democrats to deliver all of their streaming media convention coverage, says the interactive age is probably too new in this election cycle to profoundly affect voters' view of events.</p>
        <p>Still, the cat is out of the bag, and the savviest politicians, Mr. Sagan said, will quickly begin to look for ways to satisfy the demands for individualized attention from users of the Internet, who now number more than 115 million in this country.</p>
        <p>''In interactivity, people expect to control the query and get back the answer,'' Mr. Sagan said, adding his own customized parable: ''I have an odd Swiss watch that requires an authorized dealer to change the battery. I went to the company's Web site and sent them a query: how can I get the battery replaced? I got a response from someone in Switzerland saying thank you for your inquiring and that the query had been forwarded to their U.S. offices.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sagan never heard from the American branch. ''My watch is now dead in a drawer and they have a disgruntled customer,'' he said. ''They did something that's worse than not trying at all. They raised expectations and they failed to deliver.''</p>
        <p>Talk about scary scenarios: a political world in which every voter gets a personalized Internet checklist of promises from the candidate.</p>
