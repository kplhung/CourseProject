        <p>JANACEK: STRING QUARTETS  Guarneri String Quartet. Philips 456 574-2; CD.</p>
        <p>Although not programmatic works per se, Leos Janacek's two string quartets rely on concrete images to convey meaning. Both revolve around themes of love but with unconventional twists that lend the music alacrity and poignancy. Here, the venerable Guarneri String Quartet offers its first recording of this gripping music, playing with unabashed feeling and technical assurance.</p>
        <p>Titled ''Kreutzer Sonata,'' the First Quartet bears no relation to Beethoven's famous sonata for violin and piano but rather alludes to Tolstoy's novella of the same name, in which a man attempts to explain how jealousy led him to murder his wife. Janacek concerns himself more with the wife's feelings, his fecund sound world, with its colorful motivic bursts, suggesting everything from rapture to fear.</p>
        <p>The Guarneri embraces this infinite variety, invoking tension and rhapsody in an idiom rife with folk elements. Especially compelling is the ensemble's reading of the pointed third movement, in which lyrical and astringent figures vie for the listener's attention.</p>
        <p>No less overtly emotional is the Second Quartet, ''Intimate Letters,'' which relies on aspects of Janacek's own life for inspiration. Written in the composer's last year, the quartet is a naked acknowledgment of his infatuation with Kamila Stosslova, a woman nearly 40 years his junior. The Guarneri plays the piece ripely, lending it an attractive singing quality.</p>
