        <p>JAZZ on a Summer's Day'' was filmed to simulate a single day at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival -- though in truth the filmmakers Bert Stern and Aram Avakian strung together footage from several days and intercut some segues shot on Long island beach roads. Yet the film's larger subject is the bliss of being alive and adult in the Eisenhower era, smoking and listening, drinking and dancing, when jazz was not only popular but a liberating force in the American identity.</p>
        <p>The 84-minute film (New Yorker Video, $29.95) has the goopy, nearly embarrassing sweetness of a home movie, but the colors in this restored, remastered DVD version are bright and beautiful. Mr. Stern, a fashion and advertising photographer, didn't know much about jazz when he shot the film, and in a way it shows: musical devotion doesn't take over. He's at least as interested in the crowd, and the handheld camera lingers on the audience members as they listen: the poet Gregory Corso eats a cracker and wiggles the crumbs off his fingers; cherry-red lipstick and gingham shirts dot the screen; a bored girl glumly munches a popsicle; a sloshed young man clutching a paper cup pleads, ''Aw, c'mon, baby,'' to his girlfriend.</p>

        <p>JAZZ on a Summer's Day'' was filmed to simulate a single day at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival -- though in truth the filmmakers Bert Stern and Aram Avakian strung together footage from several days and intercut some segues shot on Long island beach roads. Yet the film's larger subject is the bliss of being alive and adult in the Eisenhower era, smoking and listening, drinking and dancing, when jazz was not only popular but a liberating force in the American identity.</p>
        <p>The 84-minute film (New Yorker Video, $29.95) has the goopy, nearly embarrassing sweetness of a home movie, but the colors in this restored, remastered DVD version are bright and beautiful. Mr. Stern, a fashion and advertising photographer, didn't know much about jazz when he shot the film, and in a way it shows: musical devotion doesn't take over. He's at least as interested in the crowd, and the handheld camera lingers on the audience members as they listen: the poet Gregory Corso eats a cracker and wiggles the crumbs off his fingers; cherry-red lipstick and gingham shirts dot the screen; a bored girl glumly munches a popsicle; a sloshed young man clutching a paper cup pleads, ''Aw, c'mon, baby,'' to his girlfriend.</p>
        <p>Society and music were different then: there's no sense of premature letdown, of an audience that's already paid too much, waiting to be impressed before it drifts off to buy merchandise. The film captures a moment of near purity in the country's consciousness, and Mr. Stern knew how to make ordinary young people look unperturbed and gorgeous.</p>
        <p>There are several stunning sequences of music. The film opens with Jimmy Giuffre's trio, which includes the guitarist Jim Hall and the trombonist Bob Brookmeyer, playing one of Mr. Giuffre's radically minimal, countryish tunes: in their sunglasses and tan suits, they're like young senators of agreeable modernism. Louis Armstrong's performance of ''Up a Lazy River'' and his duet with Jack Teagarden seem perfect capsules of his generous showmanship: they induce warm feelings within seconds.</p>
        <p>And in one of the film's well-known sequences, a better case is made for Anita O'Day than nearly anything she ever recorded. Standing almost completely still in her black dress and feathered wide-brim hat, she gives herself to the music, holding forth like a rhythm-obsessed musician more than a cool chanteuse.</p>
        <p>Oh, and rock had just begun. Chuck Berry, already in his early 30's and as sure of himself as any gimlet-eyed salesman, delivers a performance that makes you understand why the traditionalists packed up their lunch baskets: his serpentine physical movements are bewitching, but the band sounds like junk.</p>
        <p>Much more musical footage exists that was cut from the film, but none of it has made its way on to the DVD version; if it's anything like what's here, it would be a treasure.</p>
