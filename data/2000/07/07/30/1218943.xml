        <p>West Nile virus has returned to the New York region, if not moved farther afield. Health officials had hoped that the mosquito-borne disease -- never detected in the Western Hemisphere prior to last year, when it caused seven deaths in the New York area -- might be wiped out by cool weather. After finding infected mosquitoes, New York City sprayed. So far, no human infections have been confirmed. At least one dead infected crow was found in Boston.</p>
