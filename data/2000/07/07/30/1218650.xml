        <p>ROMANTICO DUE of Smithtown illustrates why reviewers visit a restaurant more than once and on very different nights. One quiet Monday, the sole waiter was overextended. He was amiable but always seemed to be elsewhere. The meal dragged. On the weekend, the A team was in place: three top-notch men who provided snappy service but always took the time for a friendly word.</p>
        <p>On that night, our super server noted that one of us was not eating bread and offered a substitute. On the laid-back week night, our empty breadbasket attracted no notice, even when it caught fire and we dumped a glass of water on it. That basket had held good sturdy Italian bread. As a bonus on the weekend, there was also homemade focaccia.</p>

        <p>ROMANTICO DUE of Smithtown illustrates why reviewers visit a restaurant more than once and on very different nights. One quiet Monday, the sole waiter was overextended. He was amiable but always seemed to be elsewhere. The meal dragged. On the weekend, the A team was in place: three top-notch men who provided snappy service but always took the time for a friendly word.</p>
        <p>On that night, our super server noted that one of us was not eating bread and offered a substitute. On the laid-back week night, our empty breadbasket attracted no notice, even when it caught fire and we dumped a glass of water on it. That basket had held good sturdy Italian bread. As a bonus on the weekend, there was also homemade focaccia.</p>
        <p>Although the sign above the Smithtown storefront reads Romantico Due of Port Washington, in a sentimental moment the Tizzano brothers, its owners, considered naming the new venture Sisina after their mother. But being savvy restaurateurs, they opted for Romantico after their highly popular Port Washington restaurant.</p>
        <p>The Suffolk outpost is truly the baby brother in this family, a small spot with a minuscule open kitchen the size of those in Manhattan apartments. There, Tonino Tizzano turns out a vast array of dishes. Most are successes; many are memorable.</p>
        <p>While the food was almost always good, it seemed even better on the night when the warm, embracing service was its partner. One dish that disappointed, though, was a special pasta of angel hair, mussels, cherry tomatoes and scallops. We ordered it for the scallops, but they were missing. Was this a mistake by the kitchen or did the waiter misspeak?</p>
        <p>There are wonderful salads on the list. The mixed, a bargain at $4.95, presents an interesting assortment of greens with tomatoes, red onion, julienned carrots and a beautifully balanced vinaigrette. The Caesar is the hard-to-find classic; no creamy bottled dressing here. The Romantica, with mesclun, beets, corn and roasted peppers, was its equal. The salad of the day, with arugula, tomato wedges, red onions, cucumber and Gorgonzola, also rang the bell.</p>
        <p>Another special, vegetable-barley soup, is a thick, tasty brew that I'd order again. Tender grilled calamari served with a watercress salad and bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar was a light summery treat. Two eggplant appetizers also came up aces: grilled vegetables rolled with goat cheese and garnished with greens and a hearty baked dish of layered eggplant, fresh tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil.</p>
        <p>Pastas that delivered were the very tasty linguine with baby clams, olive oil, garlic and white wine, and homemade tagliolini tossed with olive oil, black olives, garlic, capers, tomatoes and shrimp. The star of the menu, though, is the homemade fettuccine alla Romantico. This signature creation is mixed in the center of a wheel of Parmigiano reggiano at tableside. It contains no butter or cream, just cheese, but is more delicious than any Alfredo.</p>
        <p>We sampled three fish that were all lightly cooked: halibut with a topper of fresh tomatoes and black olives; blackened stripped bass, Cajun-style, and fillet of sole in a cornmeal crust with a lemon sauce. The last was tasty, but the sauce made the crisp crust soggy.</p>
        <p>Among the meats, the pounded and breaded veal topped with salad offered a pleasing contrast of flavors, textures and temperatures. The filet mignon in a peppercorn sauce accompanied by sauteed spinach and potato cakes is another recommended pick. Grilled chicken breasts were a bit dry, but their grilled vegetables platemates (portobello mushroom, red peppers, eggplant and zucchini) went a long way toward saving them.</p>
        <p>There is a creamy, just-right tiramisu offered, as well as a moist Italian cheesecake. One night, cold zabaglione over fresh berries was a hit. The only also-ran among the desserts was a chocolate-almond cake that was a tad dry.</p>
