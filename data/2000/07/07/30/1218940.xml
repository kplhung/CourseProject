        <p>The Yankees continued trying to identify ways to pry outfielder B. J. Surhoff from the Baltimore Orioles today. But their current Plan B -- a three-way deal that would have brought them Jeromy Burnitz from Milwaukee -- fell apart, when the Brewers balked at trading for the oft-injured Rondell White.</p>
        <p>With their eyes still on Surhoff, they are trying to identify another possible three-team combination that could result in Burnitz, also an outfielder, landing in the Bronx. The San Diego Padres appear to be their top choice, because the Padres want Alfonso Soriano, one of the Yankees' top prospects, and they would be willing to deal the prized young right-hander Matt Clement, meaning the Yankees, the Padres and the Brewers share common trade ground. The Brewers will not deal with the Yankees, according to a major league official, because they are not interested in Soriano or others in the Yankees' farm system, which has been stripped down by recent trades.</p>
        <p>If the Yankees cannot trade for Surhoff or Burnitz, they are expected to make a deal for Chad Curtis, the former Yankee currently with Texas, or Philadelphia's Ron Gant.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the Yankees and Orioles discussed a possible deal of Tino Martinez for Surhoff and the utilityman Jeff Conine, but both teams backed away from that. The Orioles want to get young players in their trades before Monday's 4 p.m. trading deadline, and Martinez is 32. For the Yankees to trade Martinez, they would have to scramble their clubhouse chemistry and lineup, because he has been an integral player for the franchise in three championships. ''You start thinking about it and you realize, 'Maybe I won't finish my career with this team,' '' said Martinez, who heard about the talks while watching television today.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, the Yankees manager, said he intended to speak with Martinez about the talks before tonight's game.</p>
        <p>According to a major league executive, the Yankees were trying to build a package of players for Surhoff around the minor league right-hander Dave Walling, a No. 1 draft pick in 1999, and a handful of others. Names that were tossed around included minor leaguers like Randall Simon and the veteran right-hander Jason Grimsley. The Orioles have asked repeatedly for Soriano, but the whole point of making the Surhoff trade, from the Yankees' perspective, would be to hold onto Soriano.</p>
        <p>The proposed three-team deal that fell apart had the Yankees sending Soriano to Montreal, the Expos shipping White to the Brewers and Milwaukee sending Burnitz to the Yankees. This afternoon, several baseball officials were sure this deal was close to completion.</p>
        <p>But medical personnel affiliated with the Brewers examined White's medical records, including the magnetic resonance imaging test results of his knee, and whatever they saw prompted them to kill the deal. White has been on the disabled list repeatedly during his career; he is now on the disabled list with a hamstring injury.</p>
        <p>The Brewers have told the Yankees they will have to find another trade partner -- a third team -- if they want Burnitz.</p>
        <p>Burnitz, drafted by the Mets in 1990 in the first round, was traded to the Cleveland Indians after the 1994 season before being passed on to the Brewers in a late-season deal in 1996 for Kevin Seitzer. He slugged 98 homers from 1997 to '99, becoming a star, and drove in more than 100 runs twice.</p>
        <p>He is having a poor season this year, however, batting .218 with 22 homers and 61 runs batted in. In spite of his power, he is the antithesis of the type of hitter the Yankees have succeeded with in recent years. Burnitz averaged nearly a strikeout per game in 1998 and 1999, and he has 75 strikeouts in 104 games this year. He is an all-or-nothing type of player, capable of carrying the team when he is on a hot streak, and capable of stranding dozens of runners when he is slumping.</p>
        <p>Though Burnitz has been a right fielder most of his career, he would presumably play left field for the Yankees. A left-handed hitter, he might bat as low as eighth in the Yankees' lineup, because if he batted seventh, the Yankees would have a string of three consecutive left-handed batters, David Justice, Tino Martinez and Burnitz, which would invite opposing managers to use lefty relievers late in games.</p>
        <p>The Brewers are willing to trade Burnitz because he has only one more year remaining on his contract, and will be eligible for free agency after the 2001 season; he has indicated he isn't interested in signing an extension with the Brewers at this time. Rather than wait until the off-season to deal the slugger, they want to move him now, while their leverage might be at its highest.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are also continuing to discuss a possible trade with the San Diego Padres built around Soriano and Clement. But that seems to be a lower priority -- and could not have been helped by the fact that Clement was bombed by Pittsburgh Friday with a Yankees scout in attendance.</p>
        <p>If the Yanks acquire Surhoff or Burnitz, the pressure on them to win the World Series will build because they will have made many significant moves to augment a roster already loaded with stars. Since late June, the Yankees have traded for Justice, the left-handed pitcher Denny Neagle, infielder Jose Vizcaino and the slugger Glenallen Hill, all of whom have helped the club.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>ORLANDO HERNANDEZ, on the disabled list with a sprained elbow, will throw batting practice in Tampa, Fla., Sunday, and then pitch in a minor league game Tuesday, assuming he does not suffer any setbacks. Hernandez could rejoin the Yankees' rotation in the next 10 days, and that's when DAVID CONE could be bumped from the rotation. . . . Cone worked out in Tampa today and will probably start a game late next week. . . . Second baseman CHUCK KNOBLAUCH was out of the starting lineup last night because his sore right elbow is not improving. Knoblauch has undergone extensive testing of his elbow and was found to have a mild strain, but Manager JOE TORRE acknowledged that if Knoblauch does not improve, he may need further testing.</p>
