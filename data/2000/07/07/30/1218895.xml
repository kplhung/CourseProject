        <p>The Jack Collins International Tournament at the Marshall Chess Club in Greenwich Village June 12 to June 23 honored the man who trained and coached some of America's leading players, beginning more than 60 years ago. It was also intended to give the current crop of young players the chance to achieve the qualifications for grandmaster.</p>
        <p>Three entrants earned International Chess Federation grandmaster norms. For Rogelio Barcenilla of the Philippines, it was his third and final hurdle; for Jan Gustavsson of Germany and Igor Zugic of Canada, it was their initial norm. Each tied for first place with a 6-3 score.</p>
        <p>One of the most difficult tasks in chess is to admit that you are going in the wrong direction and reverse yourself in time to win. That is what Barcenilla did against Gregory Shahade of Philadelphia.</p>

        <p>The Jack Collins International Tournament at the Marshall Chess Club in Greenwich Village June 12 to June 23 honored the man who trained and coached some of America's leading players, beginning more than 60 years ago. It was also intended to give the current crop of young players the chance to achieve the qualifications for grandmaster.</p>
        <p>Three entrants earned International Chess Federation grandmaster norms. For Rogelio Barcenilla of the Philippines, it was his third and final hurdle; for Jan Gustavsson of Germany and Igor Zugic of Canada, it was their initial norm. Each tied for first place with a 6-3 score.</p>
        <p>One of the most difficult tasks in chess is to admit that you are going in the wrong direction and reverse yourself in time to win. That is what Barcenilla did against Gregory Shahade of Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>The move that introduces the Two Knights Defense, 3 . . . Nf6, becomes a sharp gambit after 4 Ng5 d5 5 ed Na5 6 Bb5 c6 7 dc bc 8 Be2 h6 9 Nf3 e4 10 Ne5 Qd4 or 4 Bc5!? 5 Bf7 Ke7 6 Bd5 Rf8 7 Nf3 Nd4 8 Nd4 Bd4 9 O-O c6 10 c3 Bb6 11 Bb3 Qe8 12 Re1 Qg6.</p>
        <p>So, it is currently being declined by 4 d3, the introduction to the Giuoco Pianissimo. This was for a long time considered excessively quiet and harmless, but recently it has been used to postpone the real hostilities for the middlegame.</p>
        <p>Of course, Black can develop with 4 . . . Bc5, but Barcenilla likes to defend against the Ruy Lopez with the Chigorin system, and he sets up a similar formation now.</p>
        <p>Shahade's 21 Reb1 was wrong; there was no immediate future for him on the queenside. He should have played 21 Nh2 followed by 22 f4. If Barcenilla then played 22 . . . ef 23 Bf4, Shade could have attacked the b5 pawn by an early Nd4.</p>
        <p>If Barcenilla were to stand pat, the advance f5 would yield Shahade kingside attacking chances.</p>
        <p>After 23 . . . Qe7, Shahade could still have prepared f4. His 24 ab?! ab 25 Ra8 Ra8 26 Ra8 Ba8 took a lot of pressure off the black position. Shahade's 30 Bb6 was a mistake, exchanging his strong bishop.</p>
        <p>Once Barcenilla had thrust 39 . . .  f5, he had the initiative and Shahade was in trouble.</p>
        <p>Barcenilla's 43 . . . Ke7 and its following trip to the queenside indicated that he had not found the winning plan. But once he discovered that he must win on the kingside, his race to 58 . . . Kh4 prepared the decisive breakthrough with 61 . . . g4.</p>
        <p>After 62 hg hg, Shahade could not temporize with 63 Bd1 because 63 . . . g3 64 Nh1 Bh3! wins.</p>
        <p>Barcenilla's killing shot was 67 . . . Ne4!, sacrificing a piece for three decisive pawns.</p>
        <p>After 70 . . . Kh3, there was no point in going on with 71 Ng5 Kh2 72 Bf3 Bf3 73 Nf3 Kh1 74 Ke2 e4. Shahade gave up.</p>
