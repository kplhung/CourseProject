        <p>When Sister Mary Vincent Sharp got the call that there was some free furniture at a house in Northeast Philadelphia, she had to get there.</p>
        <p>When no one else was available to make the run over there during the Memorial Day weekend, the 74-year-old nun took her aging Ford Econoline truck into Philadelphia because she knew there were families here who could use the tables and chairs.</p>
        <p>When a man called from Princeton and said he had a computer to give away, Sister Mary Vincent agreed to drive to Lindenwold -- where he would be spending the weekend -- so she could get it from him. She already knew the single mother with two school-aged children who could use it.</p>
        <p>For the past 25 years, Sister Mary Vincent has lived in Camden and tried to connect people with what they need. In the Catholic Social Services office across from St. Joan of Arc Church, she is storing a few end tables for a woman who is getting a house and fielding calls from people who want to donate anything from appliances to dining room sets. A local newspaper once called her the chief recycler of nearly everything.</p>
        <p>''She was on the forefront of everything, she was a pioneer,'' said Joseph Lafferty, who worked with Sister Mary Vincent here before going to work for the archdiocese of Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Seven years ago, for instance, Sister Mary Vincent and some volunteers came up with the idea to open a warehouse where low-income people could buy household goods for less than $20. When the Catholic church did not have a building that would work, she formed a corporation, got donations and opened the Community Resource Warehouse.</p>
        <p>''Nothing she's done has been for herself,'' Mr. Lafferty said. ''Everything is for the most disadvantaged person. If you need rent money or a doctor or food, she would get it for you. She's a tough cookie, but always with the grace of God.''</p>
        <p>Tough as she is, Sister Mary Vincent is wrestling health problems these days, though she is still trying to work and recruit volunteers. She has diabetes, high blood pressure and two knees that have been replaced. And she wants the work to go on, even when the day comes that she can not be a part of it. For now, She says she keeps going by napping every day from 4 to 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>''She doesn't want to give up,' said Monsignor Robert McDermott of St. Joseph's Pro Cathedral in East Camden. ''Sister is a very charismatic person, willing to do the little things that don't get a lot of attention. She's one of the real giants. This is her life and these are her people.''</p>
        <p>Her only passion outside of helping the poor is the orchids she tends at work and in the high-rise apartment she lives in here in the shadow of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.</p>
        <p>''She always eats the three-day old bread and wears second-hand clothes,'' said Mr. Lafferty. ''She does just what the Gospel says. She lives it. She lives with the poor and she'd travel 50 miles to get a fan if she thought someone could use it.'</p>
        <p>Growing up in a middle-class family in Newark, Sister Mary Vincent did not live in poverty, though she saw it all around her and would volunteer to help the nuns there.</p>
        <p>''I just got attached to them,'' she said. ''I wanted to serve and work with the sisters and I wanted to do social work. The people were poor. They needed clothing, they needed everything.''</p>
        <p>After working as a typist in an insurance office for a year following her graduation from West Side High School, Sister Mary Vincent moved to Philadelphia and became a nun with the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity. At the age of 23, she was sent to Puerto Rico, where she taught English for 13 years and got her bachelor's degree at the University of Puerto Rico.</p>
        <p>When she returned to the United States, she got a masters degree in social work from Fordham University and worked with poor Spanish-speaking families out of a Catholic Social Services office there. In 1975 she was assigned to Camden and until a few years ago, she served as coordinator of El Centro, a Catholic agency here that provides  services to the the city's poor, of which there is an abundance.</p>
        <p>Since 1975, Camden has lost one in three jobs, and its residents' income is about half the state average. The city itself has been functionally bankrupt for more than a decade, kept afloat with cash from Trenton, which pays for 70 percent of the municipal and public school budget.</p>
        <p>Recently, because of her failing health, Sister Mary Vincent has cut back on work to three days a week in the St. Joan of Arc office. But even on days off, she keeps an ear to the ground to learn where someone can pick up a donation or get a desk for their child.</p>
        <p>''Everybody has a need,'' she said. ''They run short of food every month after the 20th. We often need to give out toilet paper, shaving cream and detergent. Right now things are a lot worse. We have a lot of poor, large families and they can't make ends meet. There are jobs, but they are low-paying jobs. And today, kids ask for so much more.''</p>
        <p>Still, Sister Mary Vincent says she never loses hope for Camden or for the people she meets here. She sees hard-working families and volunteers every day.</p>
        <p>One 85-year-old woman who lives near her office -- where there is a food pantry -- will run across the street to help unload bread deliveries from the truck.</p>
        <p>''If she sees the truck pull up, she comes to help,'' said Sister Mary Vincent. ''We have so many good helpers and good people who come in. One man with four boys comes to get bread or just comes to visit. Things just fall into place for us all the time. It's divine providence.''</p>
