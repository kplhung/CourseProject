        <p>IT used to be that a growling German shepherd or wiggling poodle at a wedding was as unwelcome as a former spouse.

        <p>IT used to be that a growling German shepherd or wiggling poodle at a wedding was as unwelcome as a former spouse. Guests assumed that disaster, or multiple personal injuries, or both, were imminent. But nowadays, dogs (and ex-lovers) are increasingly  present at weddings and much better behaved than one might expect.</p>
        <p>Several weeks ago, I watched a placid golden retriever lope straight down the aisle as the ring bearer. He delivered the ring flawlessly, like the St. Bernard that delivers brandy to stranded mountaineers.</p>
        <p>When Pamela Boardman Lloyd married Lawrence Gleeson 4th in her mother's garden in Cambridge, Mass., last October, her Tibetan terrier, Saffron, was the flower girl. ''She is a part of our family, and weddings are about family.'' Ms. Lloyd said. For her, Saffron's presence evoked everyday life at home, as well as the beauty of unplanned and even imperfect things. ''In all of our wedding pictures, you can see paws and ears in the corners,'' she said, laughing. ''There was something very natural about it.''</p>
        <p>Some couples want their dogs present to add humor to what might otherwise be a humorless day. ''Having that dog run down the aisle definitely loosens up the crowd,'' said Darcy Miller, the weddings editor of Martha Stewart Living. ''You might not think it's funny if the dog jumps up on your husband's aunt's lap, but some brides do.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, dogs play a central role in the romance of their owners, so they must be at the wedding. Susan Nastasi, who runs a Manhattan pet training service, met her husband while walking her dog in Central Park. So at her May wedding, she walked down the aisle with Ellie, a Chihuahua. Ellie wore a custom-made, white gown from doggyduds.com and a veil, which got lost in a mud puddle. The bride's own wedding gown became covered in paw prints. ''I tried to keep my top half unpawed,'' she recalled. ''I kept saying, 'No, Mummy is in a wedding dress.' ''</p>
        <p>When Marcy Blum, the New York wedding consultant, was asked about dogs and dog attire at weddings, she said, ''You can dress it up, but it's still a dog.'' She added, ''Dogs are adorable in weddings unless it's a sheepdog that's asphyxiating in 100-degree heat, and on top of that, you put a 12-pound pillow and a ribbon around its neck. That's not cute.''</p>
