        <p>THE regime of the summer blockbuster dictates that entertainment build the largest possible consensus. The notion that a movie might succeed by polarizing audiences seems absurd. Thirty summers ago, however, the landscape was quite different. The most talked-about and likely the most profitable movie to open that season was a cheaply made political button-pusher that riled audiences by mixing social satire with confrontational carnage: ''Joe.''</p>
        <p>The summer of 1970 was bracketed by the release of the X-rated ''Myra Breckinridge,'' perhaps the most reviled studio production ever, and ''Soldier Blue,'' a phenomenally violent and tendentious cavalry western that showed American soldiers committing civilian massacres a century before My Lai. ''Joe,'' which climaxed with the vigilante massacre of a hippie commune, was even more a movie of its moment -- opening at two Manhattan theaters in mid-July, barely two months after the shootings at Kent State and Jackson State.</p>
        <p>For many of the nation's college students, the spring term ended in chaos. Some 30 R.O.T.C. buildings were burned or bombed. Over 500 colleges closed early. On Wall Street -- where news of Kent State triggered the Dow's worst one-day loss since the assassination of John F. Kennedy -- an anti-war rally was attacked by 200 laborers from a nearby construction site. The construction workers -- whose hard hats subsequently became a patriotic symbol -- assaulted demonstrators and bystanders, tore down the Episcopal banner at Trinity Church, invaded City Hall to demand the American flag be raised to full staff and smashed windows at nearby Pace College.</p>
        <p>For probably the first time, American civilians fought in the streets over the war in Indochina. Although no movie captured this conflict better than ''Joe,'' the scenario was conceived the previous summer. Norman Wexler, a 42-year-old Harvard-educated advertising executive and unproduced playwright, was inspired by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew's ''silent majority'' rhetoric, and a New York magazine article on the murder of an upper-middle class girl who had taken up with an East Village drug dealer, to write a movie treatment in which a pair of World War II veterans, one a disgruntled worker and the other the well-to-do father of a wanton hippie, wreak bloody vengeance on the younger generation.</p>
        <p>Wexler, who died last summer, had no luck pitching his idea to the major studios. John G. Avildsen, a younger colleague with recent experience directing sex exploitation films, brought the idea to his employers at Cannon, then looking to produce more legitimate fare. Wexler wrote the script in eight days and Mr. Avildsen, not yet a union director and so technically only the cinematographer, was given a month to shoot the movie.</p>
        <p>Made in early 1970, entirely on location, with the actors providing their own costumes, Cannon's first non-porn feature opens with the hippies Frank (Patrick McDermott) and Melissa (Susan Sarandon) sharing a bath in the kitchen area of their squalid East Village apartment.</p>
        <p>Instead of lovemaking, explicit close-ups show Frank cooking and shooting his heroin. Melissa ingests too much speed and winds up in the hospital, after first freaking out and trashing a 14th Street sundries store -- a scene that Ms. Sarandon, who made her professional acting debut in ''Joe,'' recalls being shot without retakes. Melissa's father, the haute WASP account executive Bill Compton (Dennis Patrick), ventures downtown to collect her effects from the pad of depravity. At that moment, Frank returns to taunt him with details of Melissa's unresolved family drama. In a splendidly cheesy effect, complete with crude psychedelic superimpositions, the enraged adman bludgeons the hippie scuzzball to death.</p>
        <p>Redneck duck hunters had shot the hippie antiheroes of the previous summer's ''Easy Rider,'' but this was something new! Anything seems possible as Compton picks up Frank's dope-filled shopping bag and flees. Cut to the dank neighborhood tavern where the steamfitter Joe Curren (Peter Boyle) holds forth, mind crammed with phantom antagonists. His blunt use of profanity and racial epithets instantly captured the viewers' attention. Ignored by a weary bartender, Joe continues his obscene anti-welfare harangue.</p>
        <p>What could now match the initial frisson provided by this heavy-set working stiff installed on barstool in the middle of the afternoon shooting off his mouth as though he were a proletarian Lenny Bruce? When a haggard Compton -- desperate himself for an alcohol fix -- enters the establishment, Joe turns to the impeccably dressed newcomer and demands that he find a liberal who doesn't pander to blacks, offering a sexual favor to him if he can.</p>
        <p>Joe expressed sentiments that no American politician -- not even George Wallace -- had the nerve to articulate, at least in public. These sentiments, however, were not those of Mr. Boyle. A member of Chicago's satirical Second City, he had been radicalized by the street disturbances around the 1968 Democratic Convention. For the actor, Joe was a character he might have invented on the Second City stage. Although Mr. Avildsen was impressed with Mr. Boyle's spontaneous embellishments when he read for the part, the film's producers felt the 34-year-old actor would seem too young to have served in World War II, and in fact their first choice for the role was the B-movie gangster Lawrence Tierney.</p>
        <p>In giving on-screen presence to those blue-collar workers whose income was eaten away by wartime inflation even as the counterculture eroded their moral code, ''Joe'' developed in tandem with the social spectacle. The movie was not only retitled (from ''The Gap''), but reconfigured in the wake of May's Wall Street rumble. Originally a supporting character, Joe became the protagonist. The requisite soundtrack album even included his opening diatribe -- which escalates to a call for vigilante vengeance. When the ad man confesses his crime, Joe is ecstatic: ''I just talk about it, but you did it!''</p>
        <p>There was a sense that only extralegal force could contain the disorder. A week after ''Joe'' opened, the presidential aide Tom Charles Huston presented a plan to coordinate all domestic intelligence gathering, including wiretaps and break-ins, under White House direction. In 1972, Norman Wexler, who had been diagnosed as manic depressive, would himself be arrested and jailed for making threats against President Richard M. Nixon during the course of a commercial cross-country flight.</p>
        <p>Opening on July 15, the same day as ''The Revolutionary,'' Paul Williams's sober view of campus radicalism, ''Joe'' waded into theaters in a season of rampant youth exploitation. ''Love Story,'' the 32-year-old Yale professor Erich Segal's best-selling campus romance, was in production for its Christmas release. Mr. Segal's screenplay about a campus riot, ''R.P.M.,'' would appear in the fall. It was ''Getting Straight'' -- with Elliott Gould as a hip Viet-vet grad student and Candice Bergen as his co-ed girlfriend -- that had the luck to open 10 days after Kent State. Two weeks later, ''The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart'' recounted the picaresque adventures of a longhaired college junior (Don Johnson) without mentioning either the draft or Vietnam. The movie was shot on the Columbia campus, unlike ''The Strawberry Statement'' which, opening in June, transposed James Simon Kunin's account of the 1968 disturbances there to San Francisco after the university refused to serve as a location.</p>
        <p>SMALL wonder Joe was furious. These draft-dodging rich kids -- who, he imagined, spent their vacations at fancy resorts and had orgies -- were being presented as the crown of creation even as their opposition to the war threatened to obliterate the event that defined their fathers. Joe and Compton bond across the class divide; the movie reaches its comic high point when they tour the East Village in search of the runaway Melissa. After dinner at a macrobiotic restaurant, the pair is picked up by a gaggle of hippies and winds up partying with Frank's stash. Neither bothering to phone home, each gets himself a chick, only to discover, by the dawn's early light, that the girls' male confederates have made off with their wallets.</p>
        <p>The two guys are now living in the moment. After violently extracting an address from the girl, they drive upstate to the hippies' rural farmhouse. There, in a scene that struck some as a domestic My Lai, Joe turns avenging angel. Kids are cowering in the corner begging for mercy as Joe persuades Compton to pick up the gun. A final freeze frame has Compton shoot a just-arrived hippie chick -- it is, of course, Melissa.</p>
        <p>Hailing ''Joe'' as ''a film of Freudian anguish, biblical savagery and immense social and cinematic importance,'' Time magazine ranked the final sequence with the climax of ''Bonnie and Clyde.'' Getting away with murder might not be impossible. ''A lot of Joes sit in jury boxes these days,'' the reviewer warned. And in movie theaters: Mr. Boyle recently recalled that at the Embassy on Broadway, where ''Joe'' was screening around the clock, he and a friend snuck in at 2 a.m. to find ''people screaming at the screen.'' Mr. Boyle became an instant celebrity -- hailed as a long-lost buddy by New York hard-hats.</p>
        <p>''I had no idea that anybody would see the movie,'' Mr. Boyle said by telephone. ''It was a very strange experience -- people coming up and saying, 'That's what they ought to do with all these hippies.' I was in an identity crisis.'' Rather than revel in his new fame, Mr. Boyle spent the summer afraid for his life. ''Kids are standing up at the end of the movie and yelling, 'I'm going to shoot back, Joe,' '' he told an interviewer at the time. ''The other night I was walking down 46th Street and I had a flash of myself being shot down in the street, just because someone thought I really was Joe.''</p>
        <p>The 1970 election was dominated by events of the previous May -- as The New York Times suggested with an article on the semiotics of construction-work apparel, ''A New Hat in Political Ring.'' Meanwhile, college students were the enemy. In mid-September, Agnew took to the hustings to campaign against that ''disruptive, radical and militant minority.''</p>
        <p>A Yale student, Bill Clinton, got his political education in that election -- working for an antiwar Democratic candidate, the Reverend Joseph Duffey. Attacked by Agnew as a ''revisionist Marxist,'' Mr. Duffey was dogged throughout his Senate campaign by hard-hat demonstrators. Still, the most notorious figure at Yale that fall was Professor Charles Reich, who attributed a new consciousness to his students. First published in The New Yorker, Mr. Reich's ''Greening of America'' maintained that the nation was in the midst of an unstoppable, pot-smoking, love-making, bellbottom-wearing, non-violent revolution against the Corporate State. Mr. Reich's analysis had little interest in racism or Vietnam but much to say about the stunted consciousness of the Joe generation. The professor advised readers to ''look again at a 'fascist' -- tight-lipped, tense, crew cut, correctly dressed, church-going, an American flag on his car window, a hostile eye for communists, youth, and blacks.''</p>
        <p>The president was, of course, devoted to the blue-ing of America. Plunging into the campaign, trailed by the student demonstrators who unwittingly served him as foils, Nixon attacked the ''fawning approval'' of antiwar violence that in certain ''fashionable circles has become the mark of being 'with it.' '' The rhetoric was black and white but the election proved inconclusive. The Republicans lost nine House seats while gaining two in the Senate, where eight ''peace'' candidates won and six were defeated.</p>
        <p>Still, ''Joe'' was scarcely played out. In New York, the movie concluded a 21-week first run and then moved to selected neighborhood theaters over Thanksgiving -- a few days before J. Edgar Hoover placed the Weatherman leader Bernadine Dohrn on the F.B.I.'s most-wanted list. A stone cast in the pool of American consciousness, ''Joe'' had a continuing ripple effect. On Jan. 20, 1971, the movie again went wide. The next night, a new situation comedy had its premiere -- it featured a domesticated Joe (Archie Bunker) and was called ''All in the Family.''</p>
        <p>''Joe's'' screenplay was nominated for an Oscar, and Mr. Avildsen estimates that the movie (whose budget, reported to be around $300,000, was likely exaggerated) eventually grossed $20 million. But, however sensational in its day, ''Joe'' is a movie without a reputation -- rating not a mention in ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,'' Peter Biskind's 1998 account of the old ''new Hollywood.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps ''Joe'' belongs more to the history of American political image-making. As suggested by the minimalist title tune (''Hey Joe, don't it make you want to go to war . . . once more?''), its protagonist was the literal-minded infantryman of that Emerging Republican Majority that the political analyst Kevin Phillips detailed during the 1968 campaign. Rather than introduce a new auteur, ''Joe'' projected a new character -- and was thus precursor to such subsequent guerrilla productions as ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song'' and ''Billy Jack.'' Indeed, Mr. Avildsen enjoyed his greatest success six years later when he directed the movie that introduced another, more positive, working-class hero: Rocky.</p>
        <p>For a time, Cannon periodically took out ads for unmade sequels to its greatest hit. In 1980, the company promised ''Joe II'' and, in 1985, announced the coming of ''Citizen Joe'': ''The man has changed but the times have not. . . . He's back.'' But, of course, the times had changed. The cult of direct action that seemed so shocking in 1970 was all too characteristic of the films of the 80's -- not only were characters played by Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger accustomed to taking the law into their own hands, their exploits served to burnish the image of our movie star president, Ronald Reagan. Or so it might have seemed to Joe.</p>
