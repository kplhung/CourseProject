        <p>David Fisher is so crazy about jumping rope that he has devised a way to make a living doing it.</p>
        <p>The Chicago entertainer and acrobat calls himself the ''Rope Warrior'' and travels the world demonstrating his skill to audiences of both children and adults, including a performance for President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Fisher is accompanied by seven expert rope jumpers and a dog, Olive Oyl, who has made the Guinness Book of World Records for jumping rope.</p>
        <p>The 90-minute extravaganza features a unicycle-riding and stilt-walking jumper. The fast-paced show of circus theatrics and glow-in-the-dark ropes is set to flashy music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisher and his jumping entourage perform Friday at 1 p.m. at the Newark Museum as part of the free Summer Youth Theater.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 11, the New Jersey Chamber Music Society will introduce children to the trumpet, trombone, tuba and French horn in a program known as the Versatile Brass Family.</p>
