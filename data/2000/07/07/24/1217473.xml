        <p>JAMES-Debra. A wonderful colleague and friend who, through her hard work, dedication and thoughtfulness, touched each of us with her many acts of kindness and created a special sense of cameraderie at NYU. It is with the deepest sorrow that we mourn her death. We will miss her warmth, her enthusiasm and the profound pleasure of working with her and knowing her. We gratefully acknowledge her numerous accomplishments. One of NYU's brightest torches has been extinguished. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and all those closest to her.
