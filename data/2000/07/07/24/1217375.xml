        <p>NOTHING off the record, nothing semi-deep or shallow background,'' said Leonard Garment in a parody of this gossip-tossed city as he leaned back in his chair to plug a book in which he claims to have figured out who Deep Throat really is. Deep Throat from the Watergate scandal a generation ago. Deep Throat, the carefully veiled supersource of  Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in their book-become-movie ''All the President's Men.''</p>
        <p>Our reportorial source, Mr. Garment, spoke in a steady, low tone eight floors above the shadowy underground garage of his law office, with the rest of the capital city unaware of this meeting. The old Nixon loyalist and obsessive Watergate survivor made frequent eye contact, suggesting he was trying to seem nonevasive. (Or perhaps he was actually nonevasive. Who can say with certainty in such a city? Particularly since there was no second sourcing of any of this encounter, which was quietly arranged by a book publicist whose identity must be protected to the grave.)</p>
        <p>''John Sears,'' Mr. Garment said without whisper or flinch, identifying the man he deduces after years of amateur sleuthing to be Deep Throat.</p>
        <p>John Sears was a political lieutenant of Richard M. Nixon's who lost out in the early in-fighting of the Nixon White House, remained a respected strategist with close ties to numerous Republican figures and later served as a director of Ronald Reagan's presidential quest.</p>
        <p>''There's no DNA identification,'' Mr. Garment conceded of his grand surmise. He noted that even before the book was published, Mr. Sears met with Mr. Garment to flatly deny he was Deep Throat. He threatened to take a lie detector test and sue the author for the honor and/or dishonor of it all.</p>
        <p>''I may well sue,'' Mr. Sears angrily declared in an interview, denying Mr. Garment's thesis as ''absolute nonsense.'' ''I never met anyone in alleyways,'' Mr. Sears said. ''I never knew Woodward until well after Watergate,'' he said, treating the Garment contention as outrageous tomfoolery.</p>
        <p>Guessing who Deep Throat is used to be a capital parlor game in the years immediately after Watergate. Whether anyone still cares that much may be one of the few questions Mr. Garment can definitively answer with his book, ''In Search of Deep Throat'' (Basic Books).</p>
        <p>''He's the only one that fits,'' insisted Mr. Garment, a 76-year-old mainline lawyer and former jazz musician from Brooklyn. He described his detective ''riffing'' as an exhaustive but strangely joyful exercise in vetting and rejecting all but one of the score of usual Deep Throat suspects, from the humblest in his book (Noble Mellencamp) to the hottest (Senator Robert F. Bennett of Utah). Many were old buddies from the rise and fall of President Nixon.</p>
        <p>For years, Mr. Garment said, his search was treated as a harmless hobby, a kind of political macrame, by his wife, Suzanne, a writer who is studying to be a lawyer; and their children, Paul, a classical musician; Sara, a writer; and Annie, who is about to start Yale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garment operated not from concrete evidence -- there really isn't any -- as much as intuitive guesswork. He was a White House insider who survived the scandal unsullied and, by his own account, enraptured by the high-stakes anguish and petty knavery he witnessed up close. All suspects but Mr. Sears, he finally decided, lacked the sophisticated mastery of detail and the media-canny opportunism embodied in Deep Throat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sears confirmed that when he warned Mr. Garment off the idea last April he admitted to having been one of this city's many unidentified corollary sources in the raft of news stories, but never such a melodramatic fount as Deep Throat.</p>
        <p>''I talked to Bernstein by telephone, and the only reason I did is because I had a client,'' Mr. Sears said this week, speaking of John Caulfield, a White House aide during Watergate.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Garment has constructed a cat's-cradle of hints and theories about Mr. Sears. ''I have played the game according to their rules,'' Mr. Garment said, referring to the scant details about Deep Throat's haunting persona and omniscient walk-ons contained in the book by Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Woodward. The two have steadfastly insisted Deep Throat is a real individual and kept his name secret.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garment rejected the suspicion of some that Deep Throat was a literary device or composite source. ''If Deep Throat is a hoax, it would be a monumental one,'' he said. In the scandal-breaking stories that made the two reporters celebrated in The Washington Post, they never referred to Deep Throat. But the shadowy figure eventually became a centerpiece as their best-selling book was mapped out with book editors intrigued by newsroom mentions of their Deep Throat source of last resort, the shadowy synthesizer of fragmented leaks and clues.</p>
        <p>MR. GARMENT bases his conclusions on nuances gleaned in repeated readings of the works of the two reporters and in conversations and confrontations with a rogues' gallery of Watergate figures. As much as the cigarette-smoking, Scotch-drinking figure of Deep Throat reminded him of Mr. Sears, even more did the Watergate book's sketch of Deep Throat as a gifted late-night talker and  analyst of the larger forces ever scheming and self-protecting at the Nixon White House.</p>
        <p>Whatever refutations his book may spark, Mr. Garment says he finally has gained ''the very particular sort of satisfaction we feel when we have tied up one of the loose ends of the universe.'' But he is hardly entitled to cosmic satisfaction, in the view of Mr. Sears, who has his own intuitions about Watergate that, in contrast to his accuser, he intends to keep private. ''I think I know who Deep Throat was,'' Mr. Sears confidently declared in firmly declining the distinction for himself.</p>
