        <p>Pat Summerall will announce today that he will call two more seasons of National Football League games for Fox Sports and conclude his career with the 2002 Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>For nearly 30 years, Summerall has made understatement a virtue as the No. 1 football voice for CBS, and then Fox. He is entering his seventh season with Fox and his 20th season as John Madden's partner. Summerall's work has not been as uniformly strong during the past two seasons, as noticeable mistakes crept into his play-calling.</p>

        <p>Pat Summerall will announce today that he will call two more seasons of National Football League games for Fox Sports and conclude his career with the 2002 Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>For nearly 30 years, Summerall has made understatement a virtue as the No. 1 football voice for CBS, and then Fox. He is entering his seventh season with Fox and his 20th season as John Madden's partner. Summerall's work has not been as uniformly strong during the past two seasons, as noticeable mistakes crept into his play-calling.</p>
        <p>Joe Buck, now the lead voice of Fox's baseball telecasts, is considered a prime candidate to replace Summerall in the 2002 season.</p>
        <p>Summerall, 70, has called 13 Super Bowls as an analyst or play-by-play announcer for Fox and CBS. He was a sideline reporter for CBS at Super Bowl I. At CBS, he was also the lead voice for its golf tournaments and United States Open Tennis Championships.</p>
        <p>Summerall started his pro football career in 1952, playing for the Chicago Cardinals and the New York Giants.</p>
