        <p>Maria Bernal became the talk of Mexico during a national financial crisis in 1995, when newspapers published a photo of her frolicking on a yacht in the arms of Raul Salinas, the playboy brother of the former president.</p>
        <p>A devaluation of the peso had wiped out millions of Mexicans' life savings, and investigators had discovered that Raul Salinas had stashed $100 million in foreign accounts during his brother's presidency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salinas and Ms. Bernal quickly became protagonists in a scandal about sex, graft and the abuse of power that fed public anger with the political party that had ruled for seven decades.</p>
        <p>''Mexicans learned that the president's brother had committed adultery, avarice, even murder,'' said Guadalupe Loaeza, a writer who studies social mores. ''People were hungry, and Raul was eating lobster on a yacht with this girl. Immorality had become intolerable, and that photo rubbed it in.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bernal's memoir of her tempestuous affair with Mr. Salinas hit the bookstores last week, just when Mexicans' obsession with his family's sins had finally begun to ease. Raul Salinas is serving a 50-year prison sentence for the murder of a rival, and former President Carlos Salinas is living in exile in Ireland.</p>
        <p>The current president, Ernesto Zedillo, has governed as a sober steward, and after the governing party's election defeat this month, Mexico is awaiting the inauguration of Vicente Fox, an opposition businessman who campaigned against corruption.</p>
        <p>With Ms. Bernal's book, Mexicans are pausing for a look back at the time no so long ago when presidents ruled like kings, with powers so vast that even presidential siblings enjoyed license to pursue extravagant and sometimes criminal whimsies. The book's details are likely to fuel the resentments and desire for reform that led Mexicans to vote the governing party out.</p>
        <p>The book, ''Raul Salinas and I,'' has sold 10,000 copies in one week, making it appear likely to become a best-seller. The author has been interviewed interminably by newspaper reporters and radio hosts.</p>
        <p>During their two-year affair, Mr. Salinas and Ms. Bernal romped together through his prodigal world of ranches, thoroughbred horses and beachside mansions. She became a witness to the underbelly of a ruling political elite that was degenerating into a criminal clique before its final defeat at the polls.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bernal eventually sealed Raul Salinas's fate by turning state's witness at his murder trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salinas was a twice-divorced man of 45 when he met Ms. Bernal in 1992 during a drunken binge in Spain. She was a 30-year-old clerk in an exclusive tailor's shop, and helped Mr. Salinas buy a new suit and shoes to replace his soiled clothes.</p>
        <p>Returning to Mexico, Mr. Salinas began courting her long-distance, cabling flowers and eventually flying her to meet him at the Summer Olympics in Spain. Mr. Salinas was accompanied by an entourage of army officers, secretaries and other retainers who careered about Barcelona in a convoy of armored Mercedes-Benzes, Ms. Bernal wrote in her memoir.</p>
        <p>''At every moment, Raul displayed his enormous fortune, and some exotic desire had only to occur to him for it to be turned into reality,'' Ms. Bernal wrote. ''He had people to satisfy every whim. The least important factor was cost.''</p>
        <p>He flew Ms. Bernal to Mexico, setting her up in a penthouse apartment and ferrying her about in a private helicopter or plane. They partied at his half-dozen homes in Mexico City, his beach mansion in Acapulco, his various properties in Monterrey, his home in La Jolla, Calif., and his hacienda in Puebla State, in the shadow of two magnificent volcanoes east of Mexico City.</p>
        <p>The Puebla property was his favorite, with extensive gardens, a colonial chapel, a bull ring, a staff of 100 peons and walls hung with costly paintings, including one by El Greco.</p>
        <p>In a closet there, Ms. Bernal discovered that Mr. Salinas had an Imelda Marcos-like fetish: he owned more than 70 charro suits, the silver-buckled outfits and matching sombrero, boots and spurs worn by mariachi singers.</p>
        <p>On the hacienda's wooded property there was an enclosure stocked with deer, moose, coyotes and other animals that Mr. Salinas would kill when he felt like shooting. He fancied himself a big-game hunter. During their affair, Mr. Salinas traveled to Zimbabwe, Ms. Bernal wrote, ''where he wanted to have some new fun shooting elephants.''</p>
        <p>''He told me that to kill one of those enormous animals gave him indescribable pleasure,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Their famous tryst on the yacht in Acapulco harbor came on Ms. Bernal's second day in Mexico. It was there, she recalls, that Mr. Salinas grabbed her in a tight embrace and first consummated their love affair.</p>
        <p>''That first time was not what I had expected,'' she wrote. ''Raul was very nervous, and the subtlety of the courtship gave way to clumsy movements. I tried to calm him, but all the security he projected in his personal life disappeared in that intimate moment.''</p>
        <p>Within weeks after Ms. Bernal arrived in Mexico, Mr. Salinas proposed marriage and she accepted, she wrote. But he aspired to become a state governor, she wrote, and months later informed her abruptly that because his political career demanded a native wife, he would be marrying a Mexican socialite instead.</p>
        <p>Still, he begged Ms. Bernal not to leave him, and she agreed. She attended his wedding to her rival, and days later he moved her into his new wife's former home, where he continued to visit her.</p>
        <p>But during 1994, the tumultuous final year of Carlos Salinas's presidency, Raul Salinas became increasingly mysterious, distant and manipulative, Ms. Bernal wrote.</p>
        <p>She describes in some detail the moment in which she asserts that Raul Salinas confessed to her his involvement in a plot to murder Francisco Ruiz Massieu, his former brother-in-law, who was the No. 2 official in the governing party. One month before the September 1994 murder, Ms. Bernal wrote, Raul Salinas arrived at her home drunk and in a rage. ''That wretch finally showed his face to me,'' Mr. Salinas told Ms. Bernal, she wrote. ''The ex-husband of my sister -- that guy is going to die soon. Everything's ready. He's done me a lot of dirty tricks.''</p>
        <p>Three months after President Salinas left office in December 1994, Raul was arrested and charged with Mr. Ruiz Massieu's murder.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors have never fully established the origin of the fortune Mr. Salinas accumulated during his brother's rule. The Swiss authorities sought to prove that the funds were the profits of drug trafficking, but their efforts ended inconclusively.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salinas has acknowledged that he engineered huge profits from insider deals during the sell-off of government-owned enterprises. Ms. Bernal notes that for months during 1994 and 1995, Mr. Salinas's staff worked feverishly to shred documents.</p>
        <p>In the fall of 1994, Ms. Bernal began cooperating with prosecutors, and in the course of his trial, she became involved in a bizarre plot by prosecutors to seal Mr. Salinas's conviction by planting a skeleton on one of his ranches. She was charged with perjury and served eight months in prison, where she began writing her manuscript.</p>
        <p>She portrays her book as a discourse on love and its lessons.</p>
        <p>''I fell in love with Raul's way of being,'' she said in the interview. ''He was an attractive man, very refined. Later it was different, because you learned it was all deceit, and at the end, there was nothing but threats and blackmail. I felt more like I was in prison when I was with Raul than when I was in the penitentiary.''</p>
