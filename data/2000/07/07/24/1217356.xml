        <p>The Bolshoi Ballet ended its too brief season yesterday as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000 but not before there was room for the young Svetlana Lunkina to triumph in ''Giselle'' amid a cascade of other major debuts on Saturday.</p>
        <p>At 20, Ms. Lunkina, a porcelain figure with black hair and inherent elegance, has become the public's instant darling. Her Giselle absorbs the best of tradition but allows her presence to radiate across the stage.</p>
        <p>On Saturday afternoon, Yekaterina Maximova, one of the world's great Giselles since she was the young revelation of the Bolshoi's historic New York debut in 1959, was in the New York State Theater to watch her protegee. Much of the seamless beauty of Ms. Lunkina's performance undoubtedly comes from Ms. Maximova's coaching. One recognizes her emphasis on dramatic motivation within a pure classical style. Every step and gesture is absorbed into a coherent whole.</p>
        <p>Suddenly Vladimir Vasiliev's 1997 production of ''Giselle'' snaps into place. This is not to say that it is short on idiosyncrasies or that it does not accommodate performers who have their own ideas about the ballet. Ms. Lunkina was paired with Nikolai Tsiskaridze, who was not shy about taking liberties in his first New York appearance as Albrecht, the aristocrat in disguise who seduces and betrays Giselle, the innocent village lass. Natalia Malandina was the excellent new Myrtha, queen of the Wilis, the ghosts from whom Giselle saves Albrecht in the world of the spirits. Ruslan Pronin was new as Hilarion, the gamekeeper who loves Giselle.</p>
        <p>In the evening Andrei Uvarov made his debut as Albrecht opposite Nina Ananiashvili, who was in top form as she was on opening night on Tuesday. Maria Allash was the new Myrtha.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ananiashvili carries the ballet by remaining herself. She has a spontaneous style with a formidable technique and keeps well within the production. Nonetheless she often stands out in relief from the staging by the power of her performance, while Ms. Lunkina, younger and more malleable, has been clearly coached to remain within recognizable stylistic parameters.</p>
        <p>''Giselle'' was the idea of the French Romantic poet Theophile Gautier. Its blend of realistic drama in Act I and the formal choreography of Act II embodied his view of ballet as ''at once the most material and ideal of spectacles.''</p>
        <p>It was Ms. Lunkina's triumph to convey a visual and emotional beauty rooted in classical style, to hark back to Gautier's vision. Some productions of ''Giselle'' aptly emphasize the realism of the first act, contrasting with the more abstract corps patterns of Act II. Yet this venerable ballet, created in 1841 to Adolphe Adam's enduring score, survives on two levels: a ballet that is Romantic in content and expression but well within the tradition of classical ballet.</p>
        <p>There was no verismo in Ms. Lunkina's performance, in which every step, gesture and pose was part of a continuous act of accomplishment, a story told in a consistent and classical idiom. Her village girl had a touch of sadness from the start, while Ms. Ananiashvili's brimmed with the joy of life.</p>
        <p>Injured earlier this week, Ms. Lunkina did remarkably well under the circumstances. Her major solo in Act I, which Mr. Vasiliev has repositioned so that Giselle dances for Bathilde, Albrecht's fiancee, rather than earlier, took no risks but was a model of clarity and placement. The light skips of the first act grew into strong leaps in Act II; Ms. Lunkina did not offer the deepest of arabesques but described a superbly etched ethereal image.</p>
        <p>This was a Giselle who could touch with her prettiness and innocence in Act I, where she reacted sharply to Hilarion. Mr. Vasiliev has given that role more bravura, which occasionally breaks with dramatic logic. Mr. Pronin, like the more enraged Hilarion of Alexander Petukhov on Saturday night, had the impressive committed vigor apt for the demi-charactere dances that are new.</p>
        <p>Hilarion is more present than Albrecht, who cannot see Giselle's big solo because he is hiding from Bathilde. Why Giselle should be upset over an absentee lover is not clear in this version, but Ms. Lunkina's mad scene had the virtue of a carefully coached set piece made to look utterly natural: a young girl losing touch with reality but without hysteria.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsiskaridze on the other hand is an emotional performer, which is to his credit. Had he not substituted his own choreography for Albrecht's solo in Act II (he omitted the three double air turns) and not danced so wildly in the needless virtuosity added to the very end, his Albrecht would have persuaded with its tender passion. Unlike other Albrechts he also wore a big jeweled cross in Act II just as he wore a cross as Mercutio in ''Romeo and Juliet'' on tour last month. It was a questionable, even provincial touch.</p>
        <p>To know Romantic ballet is to understand it, and here one recommends the writings on ''Giselle'' of Lincoln Kirstein, who founded the New York City Ballet with George Balanchine. Referring to the Romantic disillusionment of the creators of ''Giselle,'' Kirstein writes in ''Movement and Metaphor'': ''The cross on Giselle's grave is simply decorative since the collaborators were entirely cynical. The divine symbol was now simply picturesque.''</p>
        <p>''Giselle'' and ''Romeo and Juliet,'' as a play, have endured because their authors were not sectarian. Private faith is one thing, performance tradition is another. Carlotta Grisi, the original Giselle of 1841, came from a Jewish family of prominent dancers and singers but she did not wear a Star of David as Giselle onstage. To impose a sectarian view on such works is to deny their universal appeal.</p>
        <p>Happily they can be appreciated on the immediate level of performance. Mr. Uvarov, a fine dancer whose image is elongated and vertical in his air turns, offered an unassertive but elegant Albrecht. The Myrthas contributed space-devouring leaps with Ms. Malandina dancing with special authority. May the Bolshoi come back soon.</p>
