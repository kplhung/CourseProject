        <p>Deutsche Telekom In Deal For Voicestream Wireless  Despite the likelihood of regulatory hurdles, Germany's largest telephone company, Deutsche Telekom, is expected to announce today that it has agreed to acquire VoiceStream Wireless for $50.7 billion.</p>
        <p>The agreement represents the first time a company that is controlled by a foreign government has tried to buy a United States phone operator and will be closely watched as a test case for whether the government will allow other such deals in the future. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Radio Host Seeks to Keep Sponsors  Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the conservative radio host who has been the target of a nationwide protest by gay groups, has begun a counter-offensive intended to retain her advertisers. The show has lost 12 brands, or nearly 10 percent, of its national advertisers. [C2.]</p>

        <p>Clark Switches Stance on Microsoft  Jim Clark, the founder of Netscape Communications, surprised a group of Internet executives last week when he said that he had bought a million shares of Microsoft stock and opposed the government's plan to break up the company. Mr. Clark, of course, played a role in convincing the Justice Department to bring the antitrust suit in the first place. What Mr. Clark did not tell the executives was where he got the money to buy the Microsoft shares: Earlier this year, he sold the America Online stock that he had received when that company bought Netscape last year. AOL's subsequent deal to buy Time Warner turned him off, he said in an interview. [C4.]</p>
        <p>When Privacy and Voyeurism Collide  The public cares about electronic privacy, so the government sued to try to stop Toysmart.com from selling customer data; civil liberties and privacy rights groups oppose an F.B.I. e-mail surveillance technology; and people have been flocking to the Web version of CBS's voyeuristic show, ''Big Brother.'' Online, it seems, privacy is in the eye of the beholder. That's why the debate over electronic privacy can get so confusing. New Economy. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Network executives for CBS and Fox, expressing concern about the risks of putting contestants with uncertain backgrounds on prime-time ''reality'' shows, said they were considering changes in the selection process. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Coordinating Customer Service  When buying goods, customers naturally think they are dealing with one company, whether they give their credit card to a store clerk, a catalog representative or a Web site. And they expect to be able to get help from any of those sources, no matter where they made a purchase. Some companies have recently begun synchronizing their catalog, Web and retail operations, which they hope will yield not only better customer service but higher profits.

        <p>O. J. Simpson Appearance Canceled  Barbara Walters has canceled an appearance by O. J. Simpson scheduled for Wednesday on ''The View,'' a syndicated daytime discussion program, after being deluged with protests from viewers and members of the program's staff. Mr. Simpson has scheduled a number of TV appearances in conjunction with the start of a Web site that will solicit money from the public for an opportunity to ask Mr. Simpson questions. [C11.]</p>
        <p>A Global Voice for Iranian News  Twenty years after fleeing his native Iran for the United States, Sassan Kamali, a TV personality in Iran before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, is a full-time television newsman once more. He is the producer and anchor of a daily newsmagazine on National Iranian Television, the first Iranian-American TV station to broadcast to a worldwide audience. [C11.]</p>
        <p>Bank Austria Sold for $7.3 Billion  HypoVereinsbank, Germany's second-biggest bank, agreed to buy Bank Austria for 7.8 billion euros, or $7.3 billion, in stock. [C12.]</p>
