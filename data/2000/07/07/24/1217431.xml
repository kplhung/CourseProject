        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>HARTFORD: NEW TRIBES  Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has asked the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reverse a tentative decision to grant federal recognition to two Connecticut Indian tribes. Mr. Blumenthal, left, said the decision to recognize the Paucatuck Eastern Pequot and Eastern Pequot tribes was tainted by a conflict of interest by Kevin Gover, the director of the bureau and a former lawyer for the Golden Hill Paugussett tribe. Mr. Blumenthal said Mr. Gover had made decisions in the two Pequot cases that favored the Paugussetts.</p>

        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>WANTAGH: SEAL PUP FOUND  Normally at this time of year, hooded seals are off in Greenland or Canada. So a 2- to 3-month-old pup was definitely in the wrong place when volunteers from the Theodore Roosevelt Nature Center spotted him flopping on the beach at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island on Saturday. Plover, as they named him, at 45 pounds is about 20 pounds underweight, said Kimberly Durham, the stranding director at the Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research and Preservation. The foundation sees dozens of stranded harp seals and harbor seals each year, but hooded seals, which have slate-blue backs and white bellies, arrive much less frequently, she said. Plover will be treated by the foundation's vet and fattened on mackerel and herring, Ms. Durham said.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>MORE SCHOOLS ONLINE  Nearly three-quarters of New Jersey public schools have Internet access, up from less than half last year, the State Department of Education said. The survey showed 72 percent of schools had access, up from 46 percent. The department said the rise in Internet access had helped speed the increase in the schools' own Web sites as well as computer training centers for teachers.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: ELECTRICITY BY WEB  The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has approved a program allowing consumers to sign up for electricity and gas services over the Internet. The program, which was approved last week, is to begin Sept. 1 and will allow Internet utility companies to compete in the energy business the same way that booksellers and other retailers offer their products and services online. It will also give so-called digital signatures the same legal status as handwritten signatures.</p>

        <p>WEST PATERSON: CELL PHONE EDUCATION  Despite one town's decision to ban the use of cellular phones while driving, West Paterson officials plan to take a different route. The borough of West Paterson will begin a public awareness campaign, stressing the dangers involved, instead of approving an outright ban like one approved this month in Marlboro. The campaign will include a series of safety awareness signs, Mayor Gary Colletti said, and the police will issue mock summonses to drivers.</p>
