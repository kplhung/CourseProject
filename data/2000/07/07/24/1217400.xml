        <p>Not long ago, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson's name was exactly where he wanted it to be, near the top of every list of likely Democratic vice-presidential nominees. A few even guessed the nomination was his to lose.</p>
        <p>After all, Mr. Richardson, 52, had shrewdly zigzagged his career up the Washington hierarchy, traveling from the House to the United Nations and then into President Clinton's cabinet. His affable nature and diplomatic triumphs combined to score glowing headlines and presidential accolades. It did not hurt his political standing that he is Hispanic and fluent in Spanish.</p>
        <p>Then June rolled around, and a confluence of events -- the Washington version of ''The Perfect Storm'' -- swallowed Mr. Richardson whole. On the heels of a scandal possibly involving espionage, two computer hard drives containing nuclear secrets went missing at Los Alamos, gasoline prices skyrocketed, and Congress turned on the former House member with a vengeance. In no time, two Republicans, a senator and a House member, called for his resignation.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Richardson's name is no longer on any list.</p>
        <p>''I realized this incident, this Los Alamos incident, has probably reduced my chances to whatever is less than zero,'' Mr. Richardson said with a pained chuckle as he spoke publicly for the first time about the tumble his career had taken.</p>
        <p>''Look, I would have accepted it,'' he said, referring to an offer for the vice-presidential nomination. ''But I wasn't pining for it. I believe in fate. I realize it's a decision based on a lot of factors that I can't control. I saw my name on lists. I was interviewed, but I never campaigned for it. Now that it's not going to happen I can deal with it.''</p>
        <p>Looking slim, with his cowboy boots perched on the coffee table in his office, Mr. Richardson appeared both frustrated at his fall and determined to rise again, perhaps, one day, as governor or senator of New Mexico. ''Certainly politics is in my blood,'' he said. ''I have one more or two more good races in me.''</p>
        <p>But all of this could not have happened at a worse moment, just as Vice President Al Gore began paring down the list and getting serious about the search for his own vice president on the Democratic ticket.</p>
        <p>While no one but Mr. Gore will really know whether Mr. Richardson could have been a strong candidate, others seem to think so. Even now, Mr. Richardson is being mentioned by some Democratic delegates as their choice for the job.</p>
        <p>But Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said that Mr. Richardson ''happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.''</p>
        <p>''When nominees name their running mates, they are looking for a lot of upside and no downside,'' Mr. Garin said. ''The last thing presidential candidates want is controversy. They tend to be controversy phobic.''</p>
        <p>Analysts, advisers and his supporters agree that Mr. Richardson would not have posed such a tantalizing target for Republicans had he not been perceived as a political star, and possibly a vice-presidential candidate, with broad appeal, especially to Latinos. And this year both parties have aggressively courted Latino voters.</p>
        <p>''There are many in the other political party who would like to see Bill Richardson taken off the political battlefield because they know he can be a profoundly important political asset to Democrats,'' said Steve Grossman, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>Hispanic advocacy groups, who see Mr. Richardson as their most powerful and popular political figure, are seething over the hits he has taken from Republicans.</p>
        <p>''They see him as a potentially unifying vote-getter, and the Latino vote is critical,'' said Rick Dovalina, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens.</p>
        <p>Others said Mr. Richardson's ambition and loyalty had put him out on a limb. ''He took one appointment too many,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat.</p>
        <p>If there was one moment that cemented his downturn, it was the June afternoon he appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee to answer questions about the missing hard drives.</p>
        <p>The week before, Mr. Richardson had missed a hearing about the Los Alamos problem, at the pinnacle of the controversy over security. He said later that he thought he had no new information at that point.</p>
        <p>An empty chair, with his name tag on the table, had made the evening news, and some wondered whether Mr. Richardson had developed a political tin ear.</p>
        <p>This time, Senator Richard C. Shelby, a conservative Alabama Republican who chairs the committee, accused Mr. Richardson of failing in his promise to tighten security. ''You've lost all credibility,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But when Senator Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat and a Senate elder, joined in the harangue, Secretary Richardson's dressing-down moved from a partisan skirmish to far more dangerous terrain.</p>
        <p>''You have shown an extreme contempt'' for Congress, Mr. Byrd said. ''You've had a bright and brilliant career. But you will never again receive the support of the Senate of the United States for any office to which you might be appointed. It's gone. You've squandered your treasure.''</p>
        <p>The two senators, Mr. Byrd and Mr. Shelby, had privately been stewing at Mr. Richardson for more parochial reasons. They held Mr. Richardson responsible for blocking their requests for money for pet projects in their home states while he reviewed their appropriateness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson said the attack shook him deeply. ''Senator Byrd's statement was disappointing and it was hurtful because it was so unexpected,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''He and I had a lot of good dealings before. What hurt me the most is that it hurt my mother so much. She's 86 and she said after all my service, I didn't deserve that. She starts crying every time she thinks of it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson is not a man who is used to being the target of such hostility; he is a man who wields schmooze the way others leverage power. In the House, where he represented New Mexico, Mr. Richardson ascended to the position of deputy whip, a job that required him to use a blend of empathy, backslapping and bullying.</p>
        <p>Then, on the side, he launched a freelance career as a troubleshooter, visiting places like Iraq, Burma and North Korea to negotiate the release of hostages and political prisoners. Mr. Richardson, never one to turn his back on a television camera, saw his image flourish.</p>
        <p>President Clinton named him United States ambassador to the United Nations, where he injected a dose of informality; he sometimes wore khakis and often made a point of chatting with diplomats who seldom warranted more than a nod from Mr. Richardson's predecessors.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Richardson took the Department of Energy job in August 1998, some wondered whether he would fade from view as his predecessors had.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson figured the job would help him fill some gaps on the resume. ''I was eager,'' he said. ''I took this job and I knew it would be a challenge. The extent of the challenge I was unaware of. I was unaware of the security problems, as massive as they were.''</p>
        <p>In fact, several months after Mr. Richardson took the job, the controversy surrounding Wen Ho Lee and Los Alamos erupted. Dr. Lee was fired from Los Alamos in March 1999. After his dismissal, investigators discovered he had downloaded vast amounts of secret nuclear data from the classified computer network and copied it onto portable tapes, some of which are now missing.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Richardson had recently started the job, he was not blamed by Congress for the security lapses; members recognized that problems had existed for a long time.</p>
        <p>But in his eagerness to assuage Congress and promote his abilities, he made a mistake he has come to regret: he oversold what he could deliver.</p>
        <p>''My conscience is very clear that I've done everything I can on security,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''What I regret is making that statement that our nuclear secrets are safe and secure, without recognizing that you also have to deal with a human element. Changing a culture towards more recognition of security was a task I didn't anticipate would be as difficult.''</p>
        <p>The lesson learned, he said, was: ''Don't make absolute statements, which is not my nature. I like to take positions. I hate to be a bureaucrat with four hands: on the one hand, on the other hand.''</p>
        <p>Congress also wanted Mr. Richardson to create a semiautonomous agency to oversee nuclear weapons. But Mr. Richardson initially resisted on the theory that another fief would not help an agency that was already too splintered. It was another squabble that raised the ire of Republicans.</p>
        <p>Senate Republicans said the agency, which has been approved, would have given him cover for the missing hard drives. ''He should have taken the advice and run with it,'' said Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the Natural Resources Committee.</p>
        <p>When oil prices shot up, something Mr. Richardson has scant control over, Republicans launched a fresh round of attacks. Few Congressional Democrats were going out of their way to defend him. Word soon circulated that he had said the administration had been caught napping on gas prices. In fact, Mr. Richardson said, his comment related only to the unexpected transportation breakdowns in the Northeast that had led to high heating-oil prices.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Richardson cranked up pressure on OPEC to produce more oil. For now, the crisis has abated, but there are new concerns about natural gas reserves. He is now focusing his energies on gasoline prices and the Los Alamos problems. Much of what has transpired on his watch, he said, has roots in past administrations. He said he believed that his record, and the changes he has instituted, would buoy him in the end.</p>
        <p>''I happen to be the fall guy for some of this,'' he said. ''It got politicized. I think there are some who used it for partisan reasons on the Hill. But that's politics. I understand that.''</p>
        <p>Few politicians, analysts and observers count Mr. Richardson out of politics altogether, calling the last few months a blip in his career.</p>
        <p>''He's got a couple of bruises, but I think he will come through this,'' said John D. Podesta, Mr. Clinton's chief of staff.</p>
        <p>For the king of schmooze, staying quiet in an election year, even for a short while, is no easy task. But he is already looking ahead to a new administration, a new job.</p>
        <p>''I realize that this Los Alamos incident is not a plus,'' he said. ''I'm not trying to minimize the negative effect this has had in the short term. But in the long term, I'm going to be a factor in politics.''</p>
