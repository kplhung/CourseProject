        <p>It may not be ''Sex and the City,'' but relationships in the computer industry often run from frosty to passionate awfully quickly. Just look at that old yin-yang pair, Apple and Microsoft.</p>
        <p>In the Microsoft antitrust case, the longtime adversaries traded charges once more, depicting even their apparent armistice in 1997 as a kind of corporate hostage deal. Apple testified that Microsoft threatened to stop development of its popular Office suite for the Macintosh, unless Apple agreed to distribute Microsoft's browser. Microsoft replied that Apple was blackmailing it with a long-running patent dispute and paid it $150 million to stop the harassment.</p>
        <p>But last week at the Macworld exhibition in New York, Microsoft and Apple were again the best of friends. ''Our relationship with Microsoft has been getting better and better,'' Steven Jobs, Apple's co-founder and chief executive, told the assembled thousands.</p>
        <p>To prove it, Microsoft executives trooped to the stage with good news for Mac users. Microsoft announced its new and improved Office 2001 for the Mac. A new look, new packaging and a raft of new features developed ''only for the Mac,'' as Kevin Browne, a Microsoft executive, put it repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Next up came Ed Fries, vice president of Microsoft's games division, who said the company planned to bring popular Microsoft games like the ''Age of Empires'' series and ''Flight Simulator'' to the Mac in an alliance with a new company, headed by Peter Tamte, a former senior Apple executive and a former senior executive at Bungie Software.</p>
        <p>Last month, Microsoft acquired Bungie, a company with deep Mac roots. The purchase, Mr. Fries explained, prompted Microsoft to revisit its approach in games, publishing most of its games for the Mac as well as for machines running Microsoft's Windows operating system. ''We didn't want to exclude some people,'' he said, ''just because they chose a certain platform,'' meaning the Mac instead of Windows.</p>
        <p>As they left the stage, Mr. Jobs warmly thanked the Microsoft executives. ''Microsoft has done a great job for us,'' he said. ''Who would have thunk it a few years ago?''</p>
