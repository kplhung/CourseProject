        <p>When Steve Earle sings about losing everything, he doesn't have to strain for realism. His voice provides that on its own; it's scarred and raspy and eroded, with nothing but ornery determination to keep it going. In his songs he makes it the voice of someone who knows he's wrecked every good thing he had and can never make amends; all he can do is persevere and move on. And there's always another highway beckoning.</p>
        <p>That all-American metaphor, the road, stays vivid in Mr. Earle's songs. His characters gaze longingly at the highway out of town or get on highways that carry them into trouble; lately, they've also been eyeing highways that lead home. Even when the characters aren't going anywhere, the road provides memories, second chances and something to believe in. ''I see my feet on the outbound side of a road to another town,'' Mr. Earle sang at the Roxy on Wednesday night, on his way to a place with ''my past behind me and my future bright'' in ''Another Road'' from his new album, ''Transcendental Blues'' (Artemis).</p>

        <p>When Steve Earle sings about losing everything, he doesn't have to strain for realism.

        <p>That all-American metaphor, the road, stays vivid in Mr. Earle's songs. His characters gaze longingly at the highway out of town or get on highways that carry them into trouble; lately, they've also been eyeing highways that lead home. Even when the characters aren't going anywhere, the road provides memories, second chances and something to believe in. ''I see my feet on the outbound side of a road to another town,'' Mr. Earle sang at the Roxy on Wednesday night, on his way to a place with ''my past behind me and my future bright'' in ''Another Road'' from his new album, ''Transcendental Blues'' (Artemis).</p>
        <p>Mr. Earle emerged from the Nashville songwriting mills in the early 1980's, coming up with his own sinewy variation of heartland rock in songs about small-town characters longing to break free. Heroin addiction nearly killed him in the early 90's, but he recovered and has been prolific since, releasing five albums since 1994. Many of his songs retain the Nashville professionalism that would make them appropriate for any cowboy-hatted singer, but in his raggedly unsentimental voice they become personal.</p>
        <p>At the Roxy he sang about loneliness and defiance, about hapless outlaws and a somber convict on the way to execution, about the burdens of the past and about lovers who believe, ''Love would hold no charm if it wasn't for the pain.'' His sister, Stacey Earle, joined him to sing ''When I Fall'' -- ''I won't have to cry alone I know/'Cause you will answer when I call'' -- in a duet that became both an apology and a vow of trust.</p>
        <p>Mr. Earle's music is clear about its roots, but those roots spread wide. He draws on Buddy Holly, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and Bruce Springsteen; he looks back to bluegrass and Celtic fiddle tunes, and every so often he adds a hint of Indian and Pakistani music. At the Roxy his band started with immense power-chord drones, akin to Neil Young's Crazy Horse, and then -- in the course of a two-hour, 33-song set -- turned to folky fingerpicking, rockabilly guitar and, in the encores, some neopsychedelic feedback, with Eric Ambel playing smart, pithy lead guitar solos in every idiom. The songs aim to be archetypal American rock, without wasted words or musical frills, and Mr. Earle sings them like hard-won wisdom.</p>
        <p>Marah, a band from Philadelphia that opened the concert, unabashedly picks up where the early Bruce Springsteen left off, combining word-drunk lyrics with bar-band exuberance. (Three out of five band members wore hats onstage.) Marah echoes the Rolling Stones, folk-rock and Southern rock. with a steel guitar instead of the E Street Band's saxophone, Marah leans toward country rather than rhythm and blues.</p>
        <p>David Belanko, Marah's singer and songwriter, strums an electric banjo and spins street scenes or stories of characters like a catfisherman, a G.I. in Vietnam and a customer at a used-LP store yearning for a girl with an armful of vinyl. Wearing a floppy hat and blurting his words, Mr. Belanko made his ambitions seem far more casual than they are.</p>
