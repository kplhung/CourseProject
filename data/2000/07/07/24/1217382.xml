        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>I still look at computers with awe and trepidation and had asked a computer-whiz friend to help me install some software on the one I had at home. He wasn't sure if the problem in installing it was in my computer or in the installation disk, and needed to test the disk on another computer. I live in a large Manhattan apartment building, and although I have a nodding acquaintance with my neighbors, I don't really know most of them. However, I was desperate to have the software installed and started knocking on doors on my floor, hoping someone with a computer would be willing to let us test the disk. One neighbor, a young woman whom I knew vaguely from the elevator, said she would be willing to help but her computer had been infected by the Love Bug virus. Then, amazingly, she handed me her laptop computer and said I could borrow it to test the disk. I was astonished that she would lend her expensive laptop to a relative stranger, thanked her and commented that it was a sign of the times. Instead of borrowing a cup of sugar to get to know your neighbor, you borrow a computer.</p>

        <p>''Oh, that's O.K.'' she said. ''I don't have any sugar.''</p>

        <p>Chita S. Rodriguez was shopping at Lord &amp; Taylor when she heard a saleswoman ask a preteenage shopper how she would like to pay -- cash or charge. The girl had a better payment system. ''Dad,'' she hollered.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>I was returning from Brooklyn on an afternoon subway to catch my return train to Albany at Penn Station. I settled into a corner two-person seat with my business luggage. A stop or two later, a somewhat bedraggled fellow entered carrying several overstuffed pieces of luggage and wheeling a full laundry cart topped with a television set. I motioned toward him, indicating my second seat. He demurred and remained in the center aisle but as the car began filling, his position became more precarious. I arose, told him I'd be getting off soon and that my seat would better accommodate him, and we changed positions. He said he was moving from Brooklyn to an apartment in the Bronx. He had started at 6 a.m., and this was his seventh and, thankfully, last trip.</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>The Booker T. Washington Learning Center operates an after-school program, for which I work, in the basement of the United Church of Christ in East Harlem. Normally we don't go upstairs to the sanctuary, but news of a funeral travels fast among 11-year-olds. The children wanted to see the body and I considered saying no, but an hour before the service, we crept into the chapel and, sure enough, an open casket displayed a woman in her Sunday best. The children were simultaneously spooked and intrigued. It was fascinating to watch as they hung back and then crept closer, one even bravely resting his hand on hers. From the dates listed on the coffin, the children figured out she was 88. (I was relieved we'd turned it into an educational pursuit.)</p>
        <p>Then they started giving her messages to take to all the people they knew in the hereafter, and also a few messages about things like needing better school lunches, a swimming pool and a playground with grass instead of gravel.</p>
        <p>If they get results, I'm going to stop writing to politicians and start going to funerals.</p>

        <p>MODERN LIFE</p>
        <p>Life is such a rush these days, everyone's in a hurry!</p>
        <p>We rush to here, we rush to there, and WORRY, WORRY, WORRY!</p>
        <p>We drive our cars like lunatics and sometimes get so frantic</p>
        <p>We tie our stomachs into knots and PANIC, PANIC, PANIC!</p>
        <p>We think that love's a thing we do, instead of what we give,</p>
        <p>And in the race to find it, we've forgotten how to live.</p>
        <p>We rush to work, back home again, and then it's to the store.</p>
        <p>We rush our carts down all the aisles and soon we're out the door.</p>
        <p>We hurry home to cook our meals and watch our computers and then</p>
        <p>We go to bed and get back up to do it all again!</p>

        <p>It was a rainy Sunday night and Judith Stix and her husband, Ernest, of St. Louis, were huddling in a doorway on 45th Street two blocks from their hotel. A cab stopped in front of them and, Mrs. Stix reports, ''A first! -- he tried to hail us!'' Mrs. Stix indicated they weren't interested and shook her head, laughing. ''What a cheap guy,'' the cabby yelled before driving away. ''Get yourself a rich boyfriend.''</p>
        <p>Nan M. Sussman was driving home through Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, listening to a National Public Radio analysis of the relationship between members of Congress and the president. Stopped at a red light, she didn't realize it had changed until she heard an impatient driver honking his horn. Only then did she notice that she was stopped at the intersection of Clinton and Congress.</p>
        <p>Andrew Arkin was late and rushing, but between appointments he had to settle some last-minute details in a shop on 75th Street near Lexington Avenue. He reached into his pocket, paid his cab fare and jumped out. He ran into the store, had a short discussion, ran out, hailed a cab and jumped in. He noticed a dollar bill and a driver's license on the floor and was astonished to find that the license had his picture on it. It was the same cab, stuck for several traffic lights just a few feet from where he had left it. When he paid his fare, he had dropped a dollar bill and his license. Happy? Of course -- with one regret: ''I should have played the lottery that day,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>I was on a propeller commuter flight into a New York metropolitan area airport, seated across the aisle from an interesting-looking man in a T-shirt, faded overalls and work boots, quite different from a cabin of briefcase- and laptop-toting business travelers. Our skinny bus with wings hit a bump or two and everyone tightened seat belts. ''I had a rough one this morning,'' my neighbor announced. ''We were cruising down the runway when the pilot slammed on the brakes, and when I inquired what the problem was, the pilot turned and said, 'Coyotes.' '' I asked where this took place and he replied, ''Manhattan.'' I wasn't aware of any airstrips in Manhattan, nor had I ever heard of coyotes there. ''Let me get this straight,'' I said. ''You were in Manhattan this morning in a plane and the pilot had to stop because there were coyotes on the runway?'' ''Yes, sir,'' he replied. ''Manhattan, Kansas.''</p>
