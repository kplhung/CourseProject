        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Priests' Group to Focus on Abortion in Campaign'' (news article, July 18): Perhaps one of the most interesting facts about Priests for Life is that it has so few members among the country's Catholic priests.</p>
        <p>After nine years of organizing, the group has attracted only 6,000 of the nation's almost 55,000 Catholic priests as members of an organization whose position matches the official position of the Catholic Church. Given the high priority placed on anti-abortion activism by many bishops and the pope, one would have thought that most of the country's priests were card-carrying members.</p>

        <p>Perhaps there are a good number who agree with the majority of Catholic lay people and believe that the moral decision should be left to the consciences of pregnant women.</p>
