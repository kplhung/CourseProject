        <p>Though Tiger Woods left with the claret jug, there were a few other players who left the British Open satisfied. Thomas Bjorn of Denmark had his best finish in a major championship, tying Ernie Els for second place at 11 under.</p>
        <p>''I had a great tournament and I'm quite happy,'' said Bjorn, a 29-year-old who played on the 1997 European Ryder Cup team. ''Any time you finish top 10 in a major, you have done well. I just need to take this golf out on tour. I'm looking forward to the P.G.A. Championship. I feel victories are coming.'' Tom Lehman and David Toms tied for fourth place, Fred Couples was sixth, while Paul Azinger, Darren Clarke, Pierre Fulke and Loren Roberts tied for seventh place.</p>

        <p>Though Tiger Woods left with the claret jug, there were a few other players who left the British Open satisfied. Thomas Bjorn of Denmark had his best finish in a major championship, tying Ernie Els for second place at 11 under.</p>
        <p>''I had a great tournament and I'm quite happy,'' said Bjorn, a 29-year-old who played on the 1997 European Ryder Cup team. ''Any time you finish top 10 in a major, you have done well. I just need to take this golf out on tour. I'm looking forward to the P.G.A. Championship. I feel victories are coming.'' Tom Lehman and David Toms tied for fourth place, Fred Couples was sixth, while Paul Azinger, Darren Clarke, Pierre Fulke and Loren Roberts tied for seventh place.</p>
        <p>''I've had a ball,'' said Couples, who skipped last year's British Open because he was not playing well at the time. ''I didn't come last year and that was a mistake. For me to play at St. Andrews, in front of these galleries, was great.''</p>
        <p>Almost all the players were surprised that the weather remained mild and relatively calm for four days. St. Andrews is known for its windy conditions and unpredictable weather, but high winds never materialized, allowing players to make far more birdies than expected. Fifty-one players finished under par. At last's year's British Open at Carnoustie, Scotland, the winning score was six over par.</p>
        <p>''We would have all liked much tougher conditions,'' Couples said. ''We didn't expect six or seven straight days of beautiful weather. It's like being in Pebble Beach.''</p>
        <p>O'Meara a Proud Friend</p>
        <p>Mark O'Meara, the 1998 British Open champion, is Tiger Woods's closest friend on the PGA Tour. As Woods completed his final few holes, O'Meara walked along in the gallery.</p>
        <p>''I spent a lot of quality time with him last week, and it doesn't surprise me to see what he's doing,'' said  O'Meara, who finished tied for 26th. ''I know what he's capable of. When I won in '98, when I brought the claret jug back to the States, he looked at it. He held it. He knew he wanted it some day. He was happy for me that I'd won as a friend, yet I think he realized in his mind that he wanted to see his name printed on that trophy very soon.</p>
        <p>''Certainly, this year, after the way he played at the United States Open, he knew he would be the heavy favorite. Sometimes that amount of pressure is tremendous. But he plays with a lot of poise. He handles himself exceptionally well, and I'm proud of that. He has brought the game to new heights and I hope he continues on the same path.''</p>
        <p>Toms Savors Road Trip</p>
        <p>The Road Hole, No. 17 at St. Andrews, kept its reputation as the world's hardest par-4, surrendering only 13 birdies; there were 191 bogeys, 49 double-bogeys and 15 scores higher than double-bogey. David Toms enjoyed playing the Road Hole,  which features an unusual tee shot that forces players to drive over a shed connected to the Old Course Hotel. It reminded Toms of a hole at his college course, Louisiana State University. ''It was the 14th hole at L.S.U.,'' he said. ''There was a barn on that hole.</p>
        <p>''To be honest, I enjoyed the practice rounds here. To be able to hit the different shots is something we never get to do. In the U.S., we play bomb the drive as hard as you can; hopefully it's in the short grass. Then you hit the next one as high as you can to stop it on the green. Then you try to make a putt on a perfect putting surface. That's the way we play golf. This is totally different.''</p>
