        <p>Besides Tiger Woods, Ernie Els also made history today at the British Open as the first golfer to finish second in three consecutive major championships. Not that he is particularly proud of having trailed Woods by eight strokes.</p>
        <p>''I'm playing a different tournament,'' he said with a wry smile. ''I play the regular tournament and Tiger plays his own event. In one way it is incredible to watch a guy play so much better than the rest of the world. In another way it is tough to talk about him every time, but I guess I might have to get used to it.''</p>

        <p>Besides Tiger Woods, Ernie Els also made history today at the British Open as the first golfer to finish second in three consecutive major championships. Not that he is particularly proud of having trailed Woods by eight strokes.</p>
        <p>''I'm playing a different tournament,'' he said with a wry smile. ''I play the regular tournament and Tiger plays his own event. In one way it is incredible to watch a guy play so much better than the rest of the world. In another way it is tough to talk about him every time, but I guess I might have to get used to it.''</p>
        <p>With a three-under-par 69 for 277, Els shared second place with Thomas Bjorn of Denmark. A 30-year-old from South Africa, Els had been second to Woods in the United States Open at Pebble Beach and tied David Duval for second behind the Masters winner, Vijay Singh.</p>
        <p>In Woods's six Tour victories this year, Els finished second in four: the Mercedes Championship and the Memorial as well as the two Opens. Els birdied four of the first five holes to move to 12 under par, five strokes behind Woods at the time. But he never made another birdie.</p>
        <p>''It is awfully hard to keep that level of play up,'' Els said of his fast start. ''You're happy to make those birdies, but you know you've got to make many more. You try to push yourself harder and harder and you know that if you keep on pushing, you start trying too hard.</p>
        <p>''Being four under through five, I felt I had to keep going. I hit good putts, but the putts did not go in. I guess I just tried too hard instead of taking Tiger's philosophy -- just playing and enjoying it. But we don't all have his ability, so it is tough at times. It's tough to take.''</p>
        <p>Els continued: ''I let a birdie slip away on the 10th hole. I was just short of the green. I did not get it up and down there. The next hole I three-putted from 30 feet for a bogey and on the 12th, which is another birdie hole, I was actually fortunate just to make par there.''</p>
        <p>Before the tournament started, Els had hoped that the wind would blow, but it never really did.</p>
        <p>''It would have helped my game,'' he said, ''but it would have helped Tiger's game also.''</p>
        <p>In 1964 Jack Nicklaus finished second or tied for second in three majors -- the Masters (to Arnold Palmer), the British Open (to Tony Lema) and the P.G.A. Championship (to Bobby Nichols) -- but not in succession. If Els were to finish second again at the P.G.A. Championship at Valhalla outside Louisville, Ky., next month, he would complete a second-place Grand Slam.</p>
        <p>But when he was asked how he played at Valhalla in the 1996 P.G.A. there, he shook his head and said, ''I played terrible there that year.''</p>
