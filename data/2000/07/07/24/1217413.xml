        <p>The United States was not expected to win this World Cup qualifying match today, but the Americans certainly did not expect to lose it in the fashion that they did.</p>
        <p>An estimated 28,000 people at Saprissa Stadium saw Hernan Medford convert a controversial penalty in the third minute of injury time to give Costa Rica a 2-1 victory and 3 valuable points. That victory will be forever tainted because the call that led to the penalty -- a hand ball charged against defender Gregg Berhalter -- was dubious.</p>
        <p>The result drops the Americans to the bottom of their group and sets up a tough road for qualification. Now, the United States most likely must win all three of its home matches to have a chance to go to the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea. The defeat meant the Americans -- who have never won in Costa Rica -- also dropped their series record with the Ticos to 7-8-3.</p>
        <p>Unable to control themselves right after the decisive call, the American players stormed Referee Peter Prendergast of Jamaica and had to be restrained. When they left the playing field, bottles and other debris rained down upon the field.</p>
        <p>Claudio Reyna, the United States captain, appeared to bump the referee and had to be restrained by his teammate Jason Kreis. Even Coach Bruce Arena got into the action, and ultimately, security was required to remove the officials from the field. But neither Reyna nor Arena were shown cards by the referee, whose authority to issue cautions or ejections extends even after the match.</p>
        <p>Moments earlier, with the score tied, 1-1, Costa Rica appealed for a penalty kick when Austin Berry was taken down by Frankie Hedjuk as he cut across the top of the penalty area. The call against Berhalter may have been a makeup.</p>
        <p>But the hand-ball call was indeed questionable: Prendergast was behind Berhalter when the alleged offense occurred, and the American defender said he could not have seen it. In fact, the play itself -- a harmless cross from Medford that Berhalter seemingly headed across the end line -- was so lackadaisical that the Americans could have been forgiven for wondering exactly what was going on.</p>
        <p>After the game, Arena minced no words. ''This was disgraceful,'' he said. ''I told the ref he cheated us, and I'd like to see him walk in this locker room and explain this officiating to these players.''</p>
        <p>No United States players were made available to the news media after the match, but Berhalter, in a statement, said: ''I headed it out of bounds. It did not touch my chest or hands. . . . The referee was under pressure to make something happen and he made a bad call.''</p>
        <p>Reyna, also in a statement said simply, ''We were robbed.''</p>
        <p>Until the the dying minutes of the game, there was little remarkable about either team's performance. The United States played poorly in first half, allowing Costa Rica to get on the board in the 10th minute when Medford found Rolando Fonseca unmarked on the left side of the field. Fonseca flashed the ball past keeper Kasey Keller with a perfect header, and with that it seemed as if the Ticos were on the path to a rout.</p>
        <p>For the first 45 minutes, the Americans struggled to even string passes together, with Eddie Lewis, Reyna and Earnie Stewart all struggling on the field. Shots were taken but went nowhere near the goal and the one chance the United States had -- when Ante Razov brilliantly dummied to David Regis -- went into the side net. Jafet Soto carved up huge portions of the American defense and Harold Wallace was allowed to roam from end to end. In fact, Lewis was playing so poorly that Wallace -- his marker -- sometimes did not even bother to shadow him tightly.</p>
        <p>But the second half was a different story as the Americans began to contain the speedy Costa Ricans and Keller began to make the kind of saves he is known for.</p>
        <p>Stifling the Ticos almost single-handedly, Keller stopped shot after shot from close range until his defense could get settled in the first 20 minutes of the second half.</p>
        <p>And then, remarkably, the United States tied the match when Tony Sanneh loped down the right side and found Razov free. Razov's right-footed shot was saved by Alvaro Mesen, but bounced directly to an unmarked Stewart. He shot cleanly home, and tied the game, 1-1.</p>
        <p>The Costa Rican team, which had been under tremendous pressure to win after dropping a game to lightly regarded Barbados -- in fact, their players had been attacked on the streets by angry fans this week -- fought back, but it seemed as if the United States would be able to kill the game and abscond with a point.</p>
        <p>But that did not happen. The Ticos had the better of the match. ''These last eight days we thought we had lost our World Cup,'' the Costa Rican striker Paolo Wanchope said. ''This means we have it back. Today we learned you must never quit.''</p>
        <p>The United States players must now go home and regroup in preparation for the next match, Aug. 16 in Foxboro, Mass., against Barbados. It now becomes a must-win game for a team that felt today as if it had one stolen.</p>
