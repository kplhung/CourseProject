        <p>There is no stopping Messiaen's ''Turangalila Symphony,'' which the New York Philharmonic played on Friday night under Hans Vonk to end the Lincoln Center Festival 2000 celebration of the composer. One moment the solo pianist is playing a slow, sultry rising arpeggio, so that you think you must just have missed a song by Frank Sinatra, and then all of a sudden a group of percussionists is pattering out arcane rhythms.</p>
        <p>No sooner has the score's electronic instrument, an ondes martenot, lent its weird voice to processional music with an Asian twist than trumpets and full orchestral strings come rampaging in with one of the work's exultant, yelping love themes. The mix is absurd, impossible and bang on. It works.</p>

        <p>There is no stopping Messiaen's ''Turangalila Symphony,'' which the New York Philharmonic played on Friday night under Hans Vonk to end the Lincoln Center Festival 2000 celebration of the composer. One moment the solo pianist is playing a slow, sultry rising arpeggio, so that you think you must just have missed a song by Frank Sinatra, and then all of a sudden a group of percussionists is pattering out arcane rhythms.</p>
        <p>No sooner has the score's electronic instrument, an ondes martenot, lent its weird voice to processional music with an Asian twist than trumpets and full orchestral strings come rampaging in with one of the work's exultant, yelping love themes. The mix is absurd, impossible and bang on. It works.</p>
        <p>It works even in an imperfect performance like this one. Although Leonard Bernstein conducted the world premiere, with the Boston Symphony in 1948, he never put the score on the Philharmonic's program, and the piece was nearly 40 years old by the time the orchestra played it for the first time. To judge from Friday's performance the musicians are still not familiar with it. Or to put it another way, they still cannot quite believe it.</p>
        <p>Lack of belief would account for the underpowered playing of the big tunes in the work's love music, into which it keeps rushing with arms wide open. These tunes need to be passionate. They need to be extreme. They need to have the musicians fully committed, on their toes and playing their hearts out. Instead there was a sense here of people replicating notes on the page, and not sure why.</p>
        <p>More rehearsal might have helped. Shaky entries, missed detail, smudges where the rhythm turns fast and awkward (especially in the 8th of the 10 movements) and patches of poor ensemble all indicated that preparation time had been inadequate. This was a pity, especially when Mr. Vonk's pacing of events was so sure, and when the orchestra kept on producing rich textures that just needed a little more precision and polish.</p>
        <p>Even so there was a good deal to enjoy. The percussionists were in good form, ready to pounce. The brass section had a lot of the right extravagance. Some neat playing from solo strings, especially violas, decorated one of the work's more abstract passages. Clarinet solos were mostly delightful. Valerie Hartmann-Claverie unleashed the ondes martenot's wailing to good effect. And Andreas Haefliger was nicely crisp, quick witted and resonant in the solo piano part.</p>
