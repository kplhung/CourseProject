        <p>A FEW years ago, retailers hailed the Internet as the ideal self-service medium, a place where they could set up shop, post thousands of pages of product information and give scarcely a thought to spending on customer service.</p>
        <p>But the prospect of cheap and easy customer service on the Internet turned out to be a hollow promise. When companies extol one-to-one relationships with their customers -- as when retailers know your name and your purchase history as soon as you reach the Web site's front page -- customers expect the same level of personalized service when something goes awry.</p>
        <p>Some Web retailers have set up enormous call centers to deal with the problem. But for traditional retailers, the task is much more complicated. Customers naturally think they are dealing with one company, whether they give their credit card to a store clerk, to a catalog telephone representative or to the Web site. And they expect to be able to get help from any of those sources, no matter where in the company's supply chain they made a purchase.</p>
        <p>The problem is, traditional retailers had little reason in the past to keep individualized records of purchases. Instead, they focused on which products moved off the shelves most quickly, and designed their technology systems accordingly. So if a consumer asks a customer service representative at a catalog about a purchase at a store or on the Web, the chances are the catalog will have no record.</p>
        <p>In retailing parlance, this issue falls under the heading of ''channel synchronization.'' In the last several months, some of the more forward-looking bricks-and-mortar companies have begun the long and expensive process of synchronizing their catalog, Web and retail operations. And though it may take time to refine these systems, the retailers hope the effort will yield not only better service for consumers, but higher profits for the companies.</p>
        <p>One of the companies is Borders Inc., which operates Borders and Waldenbooks bookstores and its online store, www.borders.com. Gordon Eiland, Borders' vice president for strategic planning, said the company was gathering all its purchasing information into one database. ''Right now, everything's scattered in computer files throughout the company,'' Mr. Eiland said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eiland said the central database, planned for completion in the next five months, would enable the company to track a customer's purchase history across each of the Borders divisions. The company hopes to use that information to make book and music recommendations to individual customers via e-mail and its Web site, and to eventually enable representatives to respond to queries whether the customers came to Borders on foot, by phone or through the Internet. If they ordered books at a store, for instance, they would be able to go to the Web and check the status of that order.</p>
        <p>''We want to fix problems on the front end to make sure they don't happen,'' Mr. Eiland said. ''But when customers do need service, you need to make sure it's outstanding.''</p>
        <p>Analysts say synchronized systems are even more crucial for retailers dealing with products that have high return rates -- like apparel -- or categories in which service after a purchase is key, like consumer electronics and computers. But that does not mean most businesses are yet following the example of Borders and other companies that have begun to synchronize their customer databases, including Home Depot, I.B.M. and Kmart.</p>
        <p>''Two years ago, less than 10 percent of traditional retailers had integrated their customer service systems,'' said Bob Chatham, an analyst with Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm. ''And that state of affairs hasn't gotten much better. Companies have been under so much pressure to produce revenue, the idea of synchronizing customer service has been pushed down the list.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chatham said that in a recent Forrester survey of 12,000 online shoppers, 40 percent said they would use more than one route to customer service. ''So companies are kidding themselves if they think consumers won't demand a synchronized experience,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But companies have plenty of reasons to be reluctant to undertake such an effort. First, it can cost $10 million to $20 million for a large retailer to install what is commonly known as customer resource management technology, or C.R.M.</p>
        <p>C.R.M. vendors like Siebel Systems, E.piphany and Xchange, charge much less than $10 million for their software. But before the software can work, companies must first build central databases, as Borders is doing, and then integrate the C.R.M. applications with a patchwork of computer systems that often pre-date the Web.</p>
        <p>To get a C.R.M. effort off the ground, executives must also persuade managers within different divisions to support a companywide task that will do little to improve the short-term revenue of their operations. In companies in which the Web store might already be seen as black hole of technology spending, mustering support for a synchronization effort can be particularly difficult.</p>
        <p>To entice executives to proceed anyway, many sellers of C.R.M. software promote its potential to improve the bottom line. With E.piphany software, for example, a customer service representative not only sees what the customer has bought from a retailer's various divisions, but can receive tips for offering the customer upgrades, free products or discounts -- and then convey those offers by phone, through e-mail or even an online chat.</p>
        <p>Or if the customer has bought inexpensive items and returned products repeatedly, the customer service person might decide to forgo the sales effort altogether, saving the time to spend on more potentially profitable customers.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that for most traditional retailers, such an integrated service-and-sales approach was at least two years away. But those who do synchronize their customer service systems could emerge with a sizable advantage over their competitors, whether they are of the bricks or clicks variety.</p>
        <p>Mike Anderson, vice president for information systems at Home Depot, said the company recognized the advantage of the synchronized technology approach two years ago. ''Customers move around -- especially the professional customers,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''So we saw a real need to centralize the customer information databases.''</p>
        <p>Home Depot, which also owns EXPO Design Centers, an upscale furnishings retailer, will be one of the last major retailers in the nation to enter the world of e-commerce, when it begins taking orders via its Web site later this summer. But because it has a centralized database, Mr. Anderson said, the company will eventually be able to offer a more seamless customer service experience to the approximately 50 million people in the Home Depot database, after making special orders or registering for credit.</p>
        <p>The database should also allow the company to better analyze customer purchasing patterns and tailor its merchandising accordingly, Mr. Anderson said. ''This will be a tremendously powerful thing for us,'' he said.</p>
