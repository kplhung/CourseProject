        <p>The Dixie Chicks paused during their concert on Thursday night at Radio City Music Hall for a slide show of their own goofy baby photos and high school fashion errors: what they called ''the really ugly pictures.'' With country music well into its video era, when hit makers like Shania Twain and Faith Hill pose like models, the Dixie Chicks have some sympathy for the unglamorous. ''You may still be ugly, but there's hope for everyone,'' said Natalie Maines, the group's lead singer.</p>
        <p>It was a homey touch in a slick, good-natured show that seesawed between clinging love songs and declarations of female independence.

        <p>The Dixie Chicks paused during their concert on Thursday night at Radio City Music Hall for a slide show of their own goofy baby photos and high school fashion errors: what they called ''the really ugly pictures.'' With country music well into its video era, when hit makers like Shania Twain and Faith Hill pose like models, the Dixie Chicks have some sympathy for the unglamorous. ''You may still be ugly, but there's hope for everyone,'' said Natalie Maines, the group's lead singer.</p>
        <p>It was a homey touch in a slick, good-natured show that seesawed between clinging love songs and declarations of female independence. With their two major-label albums, the Dixie Chicks have become country's latest blockbuster group by mixing old-fashioned musicianship, smart song choices, diligent touring and cheerful blond image building.</p>
        <p>Martie Seidel, on fiddle, and Emily Robison, who plays banjo, dobro and guitar, are sisters and founding members of the Dixie Chicks. Ms. Maines replaced the group's lead singer in 1995, as the group turned from bluegrass and cowgirl songs to more current material; she sings in a tangy honky-tonk voice while the sisters harmonize above her.</p>
        <p>Most of the Chicks' songs are about estranged lovers. Sometimes the singer wishes her man were back, or that she could tear him away from a rival, promising ''I Can Love You Better''; sometimes she's ready to give him the heave-ho. ''Wide Open Spaces'' (Monument/ Sony), the Dixie Chicks' first big-label album, was mostly accommodating, but their second, ''Fly'' (Monument/Sony), turned much more feisty. Like Ms. Twain, Mary Chapin Carpenter and Martina McBride, the Dixie Chicks have discovered that country-music audiences thrill to songs about women breaking loose and, even better, getting even.</p>
        <p>The concert opened with ''Ready to Run,'' in which the singer flees commitment to ''have some fun,'' and peaked with the bouncy, triumphant ''Goodbye Earl,'' in which a battered wife murders her husband and gets away with it: ''It turned out he was a missing person nobody missed.'' Lest anyone miss the narrative, the song's video clip was shown onstage while Ms. Maines sang from a perch in the audience. ''Sin Wagon,'' in which the singer decides to go out and find a partner for ''mattress dancing,'' toyed with musical blasphemy by including part of the bluegrass gospel standard ''I'll Fly Away.''</p>
        <p>Onstage the sisters reminded fans of their days playing bluegrass festivals and showed their proficiency with a glistening banjo-fiddle duet. They also inserted the banjo into more modern country-pop songs; they have been credited with returning the sound of the banjo to country radio stations that had lately considered it too rural.</p>
        <p>Yet while the Dixie Chicks use slightly less rock muscle than Ms. Twain or Garth Brooks, they're not reviving the past. For every honky-tonk shuffle in the set, there were two or three tunes based on fingerpicking 1970's soft rock, and the Chicks' harmonies owe as much to Crosby, Stills and Nash as to bluegrass.</p>
        <p>The Dixie Chicks are in line with country tradition when they sing about strains on the marital bond. But they're in modern, suburban-country territory when they take it lightly.</p>
        <p>Patty Griffin, who wrote ''Let It Fly'' (the title song for ''Fly'') and sang it with the Dixie Chicks onstage, plunged into rock with an adventurous opening set. Like Sarah McLachlan and P. J. Harvey, she writes songs about a tormented, mystical love that merges desire, memory and religious faith. For most of her set, she placed her resolute voice amid churning, droning, distorted guitars, vividly capturing the visionary tone of her songs even as some Dixie Chicks fans fled for the lobby.</p>
