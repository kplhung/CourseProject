        <p>Tiger Woods Completes His Career Grand Slam  Tiger Woods won the 129th British Open by eight strokes yesterday at the Old Course in St. Andrews, Scotland, and at age 24 became the youngest golfer to complete the sport's career Grand Slam. Woods won the Masters in 1997 and the P.G.A. Championship in 1999. He won this year's United States Open by 15 strokes, the largest victory margin in a major championship. Only four others have won the four majors: Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus. Woods shot 19 under par, the best score against par in a major.</p>
        <p>A Repeat Performance By Armstrong in the Tour  Lance Armstrong, the 28-year-old Texan who three years ago was fighting for his life against cancer, won his second consecutive Tour de France bicycle race yesterday, by 6 minutes 2 seconds. He is the second American to win two in a row. Greg LeMond won it in 1989 and 1990.</p>

        <p>Webb Wins Her First U.S. Open  After losing her four-stroke lead yesterday, Karrie Webb, 25, finished at six-under-par 282 and won her first United States Women's Open, by five strokes.</p>
        <p>Johnson-Greene Showdown Fizzles  Michael Johnson, right, and Maurice Greene both pulled up lame in the 200 meters at the U.S. Olympic trials, meaning neither will run the event in Sydney.</p>
