        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Struggle Over Certified Teachers'' (editorial, July 19):</p>
        <p>Whether or not a teacher is certified has little to do with the teacher's ability to succeed in the classroom. Wealthy parents pay substantial amounts to send their children to elite private schools staffed almost exclusively by uncertified teachers.</p>
        <p>In our nation's poorest schools, many of the most successful teachers are uncertified, having left another career to teach or entered the profession through elite programs like Teach for America.</p>
        <p>While Richard P. Mills, New York State's education commissioner, should be commended for drawing attention to the plight of the city's low-performing schools, he must move beyond the certified-versusuncertified debate if he truly wishes to address the root problem of poor teacher quality in urban public schools.</p>
