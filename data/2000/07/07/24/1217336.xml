        <p>Barry Ancona letter on July 17 editorial calls for repeal of estate tax</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While I trust that Americans still embrace the 20th-century principle of progressivity for income taxes (editorial, July 17), they also appear to embrace the 18th-century principle that taxes should not be confiscatory. A majority, however, deem estate taxes to be just that, reasoning that once you have made your money -- and paid income taxes on it -- you should get to dispose of it as you wish without further taxation.</p>

        <p>While I trust that Americans still embrace the 20th-century principle of progressivity for income taxes (editorial, July 17), they also appear to embrace the 18th-century principle that taxes should not be confiscatory. A majority, however, deem estate taxes to be just that, reasoning that once you have made your money -- and paid income taxes on it -- you should get to dispose of it as you wish without further taxation.</p>
        <p>Abolition of the estate tax would not be anti-progressive. For example, if I do not need a loan to pay the estate tax when inheriting my parents' small business, I will make that much more from it, and will pay more income tax. If I do not have to liquidate stocks and bonds to pay the estate tax, I will earn that much more in dividends and interest, on which I will pay more tax.</p>
