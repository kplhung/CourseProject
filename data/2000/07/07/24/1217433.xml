        <p>The courtship of Barry Larkin lasted 12 hours. There was no recruiting trip to Cincinnati, no bonus given and no top prospect sacrificed to bring the Reds' All-Star shortstop to the Mets. Larkin vetoed a proposed trade to the Mets, who have a week to go before the nonwaiver trading deadline and have added no players through a trade this month.</p>
        <p>After today's Reds home game, Larkin signed a three-year, $27 million contract extension that will keep him in Cincinnati through 2003.</p>
        <p>The Mets had offered to deal their best prospect, the Class AA outfielder Alex Escobar, plus the Class AAA reliever Eric Cammack and the Class A starting pitcher Jason Saenz, according to a baseball official.</p>
        <p>But they were unwilling to give Larkin a three-year contract extension, offering instead a bonus to be paid if the Mets did not re-sign him within 10 days after the World Series. The bonus -- which one official said was worth $1 million -- and the chance to help the Mets in the pennant race were not enough to entice the 36-year-old Larkin to leave the Reds; he is a Cincinnati native who has played with the team since 1986.</p>
        <p>''It's disappointing, but we've got to just move forward,'' said Mets General Manager Steve Phillips, who watched his team lose, 1-0, tonight to the Braves at Turner Field. ''We've got some other exciting things we're talking about that we'll just have to go after.''</p>
        <p>They went after Larkin aggressively, offering to fly a contingent of Mets to Cincinnati between Saturday's afternoon game and today's night game in Atlanta. Phillips received permission to talk to Larkin and his agent, Eric Goldschmidt, at 10 a.m. Saturday, but a little after 10 p.m., Goldschmidt told Phillips that without a new contract, Larkin was declining the deal.</p>
        <p>Phillips said he was astonished when he heard from the Mets public relations director that Larkin had signed a contract extension. Phillips tried to call Reds General Manager Jim Bowden, without success, then called Goldschmidt, who told him the Reds' owner, John Allen, had stepped in to make the deal happen.</p>
        <p>''I would have expected the courtesy of a phone call,'' Phillips said, referring to Bowden, ''to at least say, 'This is what's happening.' ''</p>
        <p>Phillips said he thought Bowden should have called him, if only to reassure Phillips that the Mets had not been used.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there was malice in anyone's intent,'' Phillips said. ''I guess we helped Barry Larkin get a contract. I should call Goldschmidt back and see what kind of cut I get out of his fee.''</p>
        <p>It seemed as if the Reds' shortstop wound up getting exactly what he wanted. After signing the extension, Larkin said: ''My family was very important in telling me they wanted me to be happy. I'm happy here and will continue to be happy here for the next three years at least.'' Larkin also admitted that he thought he was being traded again when Bowden approached him after the game.</p>
        <p>For the Mets, it has never been more clear that they intend to pursue Alex Rodriguez, the Seattle shortstop, who will also be a free agent. Asked if his unwillingness to give Larkin an extension was because he has Rey Ordonez signed for three more years or because of his off-season plans, Phillips said both played a role.</p>
        <p>''It's an appealing free-agent class this year, and it's one that, to make all of the decisions today about what the future will look like really wasn't something we wanted to do,'' Phillips said.</p>
        <p>Phillips said he had no regrets about making the trade, despite Larkin's refusal. Phillips said Bowden told him that Larkin would accept a deal to the Mets because Larkin was tired of the negativity in Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview before Larkin signed the extension, Bowden said: ''The only reason I thought it was possible he might accept it is, when I talked to Barry on July 8, he said if the Reds don't sign him, 'Just trade me so I don't have to go through all this negativity for the rest of the year.' At no time did he say, 'Trade me, but the team that gets me has to give me three years and $30 million.' ''</p>
        <p>As for Phillips, he was not especially relieved to have held on to the players in the trade package. ''It was a good deal for the club, so I'm not relieved by it,'' Phillips said. ''It may open some doors.''</p>
        <p>The Mets may still trade Escobar, the 21-year-old native of Venezuela who is considered among baseball's best prospects. Other teams also covet the minor league pitchers Grant Roberts and Pat Strange and outfielder Brian Cole.</p>
        <p>The Baltimore Orioles are willing to deal their shortstop, Mike Bordick, and Ordonez has been mentioned in trade talks. But Ordonez is owed $16 million over the next three years, which could be a problem for the Orioles, who seem to prefer the idea of re-signing Bordick this winter even if he is traded.</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia Phillies would consider trading their No. 1 starter, Curt Schilling, if they were overwhelmed in a deal, but the Mets do not believe outfielders Manny Ramirez of Cleveland and Jeromy Burnitz of Milwaukee will be available.</p>
