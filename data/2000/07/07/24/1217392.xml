        <p>Republicans warn of the dangers of a big ''one size fits all'' prescription drug program for the elderly, run by the heavy hand of government bureaucrats. Democrats rail against the prospect of elderly Americans at the mercy of profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies, and scoff at Republican efforts to provide drug coverage through the private sector.</p>
        <p>For months now, pollsters and strategists in both parties have been testing and honing these arguments, knowing that the cost of prescription drugs -- and the lack of Medicare coverage for them -- is one of the most powerful issues of this election year. But as the recent drug bill passed by House Republicans underscored, many analysts say, all the positioning comes down to an old philosophical division between the parties: How big a role should the government play in providing health care? How much should be left to the private sector?</p>
        <p>The issue flared, briefly but bitterly, on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' today, when Robert Shrum, an adviser to Vice President Al Gore, said Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was giving short shrift to the plight of the elderly. Mr. Shrum said Democrats wanted a drug plan ''that provides for all senior citizens under Medicare,'' while Governor Bush ''wants one that lets seniors go out and beg the H.M.O.'s and insurance companies for coverage.''</p>
        <p>Karen P. Hughes, the spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, countered that Mr. Gore had ignored ''bipartisan opportunities'' to pass drug legislation, and said that Mr. Bush was ''committed to reforming and modernizing Medicare to provide prescription drug coverage.''</p>
        <p>The battle over the role of government has waxed and waned around Medicare, which covers 39 million elderly and disabled Americans, since the program was created 35 years ago this month. But coming now, when both the White House and the House are up for grabs, it is a struggle fraught with implications not only for how older Americans get their drug coverage -- which many believe will ultimately be determined by the next administration and Congress -- but also for how the broader Medicare program is reconfigured over the next several years.</p>
        <p>''It would be a mistake to say it's only political positioning,'' said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research group. ''There is an underlying philosophical difference, with the Democrats preferring to expand a public program and the Republicans wanting to go with private insurers and the marketplace.''</p>
        <p>Robert J. Blendon, an expert on public opinion and health at Harvard University, argued, ''When people say there's nothing fundamental going on in this election, my answer is that there is something fundamental going on about the shape of this program.'' With the Democrats controlling the House and the White House, he said, ''We'd end up with a very different Medicare in 10 years than if the country went Republican.''</p>
        <p>In the prescription drug plan passed four weeks ago on party lines, House Republicans looked to the private sector to provide new coverage, using federal subsidies to encourage insurance companies to offer drug policies to the elderly. The plan promises every Medicare beneficiary a choice of two drug plans.</p>
        <p>Representative James C. Greenwood, the Pennsylvania Republican who was one of the leaders in getting the plan through the House, argued that it sought to ''create the climate and the incentives for these companies to offer competitive products in the marketplace,'' and thus ''reflects our faith in the marketplace versus our faith in government.''</p>
        <p>House Democrats lined up behind the idea of adding a standardized drug benefit to the traditional Medicare program, voluntary but guaranteed to every beneficiary. ''The Democrats firmly believe that a social program such as this needs to be managed and controlled by government, whereas Republicans believe if you're going to have this type of program, make it a voucher-type program for private insurance,'' said Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, one of the Democratic Party's experts on health.</p>
        <p>When it comes to the details of these proposals, the philosophical line can get fuzzier. The House Republican proposal for example, allows for a government ''fallback'' plan if private companies do not enter a market, which critics say is a major danger. And not all Republicans support the House legislation. Two weeks ago, Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, offered a different approach. Both the House Democrats' drug proposal and the administration's, meanwhile, allow for private pharmaceutical benefit managers -- acting as intermediaries for the government -- to negotiate with the drug companies and administer the program.</p>
        <p>Moreover, in recent years many Democrats -- including the administration ---- have advocated a gradual restructuring of Medicare to encourage more involvement by private managed-care companies, in hopes of improving the quality and controlling the costs of health care for the elderly. Only about 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are in H.M.O.'s.</p>
        <p>But there are real divisions between the parties over Medicare that transcend prescription drugs -- about the pace of any Medicare restructuring, how much the traditional fee-for-service program should be protected in any new competitive marketplace, what kind of oversight and regulation should exist, and what kind of financial incentives should be used to encourage older Americans to consider managed-care plans.</p>
        <p>The track record of managed care in Medicare -- many private plans have pulled out of the program, asserting that it was unprofitable -- has stoked the doubts of Democrats about the virtues of the private market. And in the House debate over prescription drugs, Democrats had agreement from an unlikely source: the Health Insurance Association of America said the Republican plan probably would not work, because insurance companies would not be interested in offering drug-only policies to the elderly.</p>
        <p>''Experts have raised questions for years about the willingness of the marketplace to care for older and really sick people, Dr. Altman said, ''and those questions are still there, whether it's the willingness of H.M.O.'s under Medicare or the willingness of insurance companies to provide drug benefits.''</p>
        <p>These divisions are already playing out in the House and Senate elections. The New York State Democratic Committee has run a television commercial against Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for the Senate, that declares: ''Bowing to the drug companies, Lazio voted for a plan that would leave millions without affordable coverage. Tell Lazio: Next time vote for us.'' The A.F.L.-C.I.O. is running similar commercials in several House districts.</p>
        <p>On the other side, the Republican Leadership Coalition is running radio advertisements in several districts assailing each Democrat for ''turning his back on prescription drug coverage for seniors'' by voting against the Republican plan.</p>
        <p>Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, asserted that people ''just laugh'' in focus groups when asked which approach they prefer: assistance in buying private insurance for prescription drugs, or a government benefit. Anger at the drug companies is far outweighing any fears of government, Ms. Lake asserted.</p>
        <p>Geoffrey Garin, a chief pollster for House Democrats, argued, ''George W. Bush has been trying very hard and with some success to avoid any debate about big philosophical questions, but Medicare really is a chance for Democrats to raise a question about the role of government versus the private sector, on a topic where voters have already made a pretty clear decision.''</p>
        <p>Republicans, of course, disagree. Their pollsters say the promise of ''choice'' -- different private plans from which to choose -- versus a ''one size fits all'' government plan is an easy one. Voters want the choice and fear the government, the pollsters say.</p>
        <p>''When Republicans talk about the Democratic plan as bureaucrats and politicians in Washington making decisions about prescription drugs, that's extraordinarily effective,'' said Glenn Bolger, a top pollster for House Republicans. This framing of the debate was used by Republicans and industry groups in the struggle over the Clinton health care plan -- notably in the ''Harry and Louise'' campaign -- with much success.</p>
        <p>In the presidential campaign, the contrast is not as clear, largely because Governor Bush has remained vague on Medicare issues. For example, when asked Mr. Bush's position on the Medicare prescription drug bill recently passed by his party in the House, Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said that Mr. Bush ''wants to review the final Congressional product.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer said the governor supported ''reforming'' Medicare, adding that he had endorsed six principles that would guide his reform, among them maintaining Medicare's guaranteed access to all elderly and promising all beneficiaries a choice of health plans, ''including the option of purchasing a plan that covers prescription drugs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and his spokesmen have also talked approvingly of the work of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, and faulted the administration for blocking its work -- although the commission was advocating a market-oriented plan that by some estimates could have made it significantly more costly for the elderly to stay with traditional fee-for-service Medicare, and raised the eligibility age for Medicare to 67 from 65.</p>
        <p>Still, the specifics of Mr. Bush's thinking on Medicare may not come until this fall's debates, when Mr. Gore is sure to raise it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, recognizing his party's longstanding image as the guardian of Medicare, has campaigned hard on the issue, vowing to put Medicare in a ''lock box'' so its $400 billion in surpluses cannot be used for tax cuts or other new spending, and to extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund to 2030. He has also advocated adding a prescription drug benefit to the traditional Medicare program, in line with his party, and has scoffed at the House Republican plan as ''a pretend plan that even the insurance industry doesn't think will work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is also committed to the ''modernization'' proposals put forth by the Clinton administration, which try to inject more competition among health plans while protecting the fee-for-service program.</p>
        <p>In the end, Medicare may turn out to be much more of an issue in Congressional elections than in the presidential contest. Several health policy analysts noted that Mr. Bush was far more willing to plunge into the politics of Social Security than Medicare, which remains among the most popular government initiatives. Even so, analysts maintain, this election has big consequences for the program, which was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson as the centerpiece of the Great Society.</p>
