        <p>Joining the raft of big communications companies trying to capitalize on Internet commerce, SBC Communications Inc. plans a series of moves this week meant to enhance the company's presence in cyberspace.</p>
        <p>In addition to acquiring control of a small company that manages Web sites for businesses, SBC intends to announce partnerships with Commerce One Inc., the software maker, and with the consulting firms Deloitte Consulting and Proxicom, people close to the company said.</p>
        <p>SBC, the nation's second-largest regional telephone company, also intends to announce that it is using equipment from Cisco Systems Inc. to create a $50 million center for housing Internet systems for business customers. SBC also plans soon to offer software applications from Microsoft and others for use by corporate clients -- an increasingly popular option for business customers that want to avoid the cost and headaches of managing their own desktop software.</p>
        <p>An SBC spokesman declined to comment, but one person close to the company said the announcements could be made as soon as tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Over the last year or so, many of the nation's biggest communications carriers, including AT&amp;T and Sprint, have begun efforts to offer a range of complex business services far broader than the relatively simple communications lines that have long been the industry's mainstay.</p>
        <p>Deregulation and the emergence of many new carriers have largely turned the business of offering communications lines into a commodity market, prompting carriers to seek better profit margins through more advanced services.</p>
        <p>SBC, with its roughly $4 billion acquisition of Sterling Commerce Inc. earlier this year, had already become the regional Bell company with the biggest presence in electronic commerce. Sterling develops systems that enable businesses to exchange information electronically. This week's announcements would build on the Sterling deal to allow SBC to offer a broader range of so-called e-business services.</p>
        <p>In some ways, the cornerstone of this week's deals will be SBC's announcement of an agreement to acquire a controlling stake in InQuent Technologies, the corporate parent of WebHosting.com.</p>
        <p>WebHosting is a small company in Toronto that runs Web sites for business customers. Full financial details were unclear late last week, but one person close to the deal said that SBC would pay a bit more than $100 million for a bare majority of InQuent.</p>
        <p>SBC already owns 20 percent of Bell Canada, which has a marketing agreement with WebHosting.com. Late last week, the companies were still negotiating a possible role for Bell Canada in SBC's InQuent investment.</p>
        <p>Some of the new corporate customers that SBC would hope to sign up as a result of the InQuent investment and the relationships with Deloitte, part of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and Proxicom could run their Web sites from SBC's new Internet data center, to be located in Dallas. The new center is set to open at the end of this month.</p>
        <p>In addition to operating Web sites, SBC also intends to begin allowing corporate customers to use SBC's network and the new Dallas center to run Microsoft's Exchange software, which allows people in far-flung locations to collaborate electronically.</p>
        <p>SBC will face significant competition in its efforts to offer more advanced business services. In fact, the big long-distance carriers, unburdened by the regulatory constraints that have largely prevented the Bell companies from offering long-distance services, have generally taken the lead in that arena.</p>
        <p>WorldCom Inc., for instance, runs the world's biggest Internet carrier, UUnet, and is also moving to offer a more complete range of e-commerce systems. In January, AT&amp;T announced an initiative to open its network to ''applications service providers'' -- companies that remotely manage software applications for corporate customers. Sprint has run Web sites for businesses since 1998, and this spring the company began offering a broad package of e-commerce services.</p>
        <p>Among the big local carriers, U S West was recently acquired by Qwest Communications International Inc., which has built on its advanced fiber optic network by striking a range of agreements with software and consulting companies to run complex software applications. Bell Atlantic recently merged with GTE, which controlled the No. 2 Internet carrier, BBN.</p>
        <p>To win regulatory approval for their merger, Bell Atlantic and GTE had to sell more than 90 percent of BBN, now named Genuity, to the public.</p>
        <p>But the merged Bell Atlantic-GTE, now named Verizon Communications, hopes to retake ownership of Genuity within a few years. Genuity has moved quickly in recent years to offer corporate customers packages of Internet access, e-commerce software and electronic security systems.</p>
