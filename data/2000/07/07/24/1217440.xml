        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report that some electric utility companies are saving money and conserving energy by giving consumers financial incentives to curtail use, especially during peak hours (front page, July 17).</p>
        <p>Of course these only seem like novel ideas to the electric companies because of their decades of history as government-managed monopolies. Now that new technologies and attempts at deregulation are giving utilities a glimpse of free-market conditions, the companies are beginning to act like market competitors concerned with the needs of their customers.</p>

        <p>Of course these only seem like novel ideas to the electric companies because of their decades of history as government-managed monopolies. Now that new technologies and attempts at deregulation are giving utilities a glimpse of free-market conditions, the companies are beginning to act like market competitors concerned with the needs of their customers.</p>
        <p>As a result, prices are dropping and service is improving.</p>
        <p>Complete privatization would further these trends and eliminate the need for government subsidies altogether.</p>
