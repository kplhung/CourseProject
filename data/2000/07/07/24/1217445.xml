        <p>WHAT a difference 1,088 miles make.</p>
        <p>Just over a thousand miles south of New York City lies Miami, once a swamp.</p>
        <p>Mosquitoes love swamps. With the people of New York and environs anguishing over mosquitoes -- whether to spray, what to spray, why, where and when to spray -- we thought it made sense to phone Miami's mosquito expert for a little advice.</p>
        <p>What we learned, among other things, is this: how you feel about spraying mosquitoes is very much a matter of where you live. In Miami-Dade County, mosquito control has become so routine it's like the white noise of sirens in Midtown Manhattan. Hardly anyone notices.</p>
        <p>''Mosquito control got started here in 1935,'' reports Marlon Nelms, chief of mosquito control in Miami-Dade, population  two million.</p>
        <p>''We're one of 50 programs in the state of Florida that has an active program year round for controlling mosquitoes. We inspect standing water for mosquito larvae. If we find any, we apply insecticide. We spray for adult mosquitoes by truck and aircraft.''</p>
        <p>While he knows of no studies of the long-term effects of the spraying, he is aware of no serious health complaints. Environmentalists have qualms but are not as aggressive in trying to stop the spraying as in New York, where opponents filed a lawsuit.</p>
        <p>''There is a feeling that all pesticides are poisonous, and it's true. They are poisonous. To something,'' said Mr. Nelms, who emphasized that Miami-Dade uses very small amounts of insecticide. ''You would think that if there were serious long-term effects, something would have been seen here or somewhere in the state of Florida.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nelms, 60, an entomologist with 32 years of experience in mosquito hunting, can tell you about every kind of mosquito peculiarity in the world, from the favorite hiding places of urban mosquitoes (storm drains and old tires) to how far these annoyances travel (usually no more than 4 miles, though the salt marsh variety can fly 40 miles with tail winds).</p>
        <p>While he would not presume to offer long-distance advice to New York, he does have some helpful insights. Mainly, take it easy.</p>
        <p>''I would say, monitor the situation, but don't become unduly alarmed.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes people come to the conclusion that if a lot of birds become infected, people are going to become infected. But that is not necessarily so. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it does not.''</p>
        <p>That is true for St. Louis encephalitis, which has been detected in Miami, as well as for the West Nile virus found in birds this season in the New York area.</p>
        <p>''You can have a fairly large number of birds infected, have a large mosquito population, and nothing happens,'' Mr. Nelms said. He's seen the opposite, too. ''It is not really clear what the relationship is between infected birds and human beings. A lot of biology is not really closely understood.''</p>
        <p>GIVEN the likely political fallout if someone became ill when bitten, the authorities in the New York area are spraying now that they have found infected birds.</p>
        <p>Miami-Dade does concentrated spraying only after confirmation that someone has contracted a mosquito-borne illness, but sprays small amounts of insecticide selectively almost every night from mid-May to October, generally in response to complaints about nuisance mosquitoes (bites, not sickness). People sensitive to the insecticides are registered and alerted of impending spraying.</p>
        <p>Miami-Dade treats standing water with Bacillus thuringiensis israeliensis, a bacterium discovered in Israel that kills mosquito larvae. Trucks spray malathion, which was used in New York last year; planes spray a different form of malathion. All Miami spraying is done at night, and the chemicals break down quickly, Mr. Nelms said. ''They're destroyed by sunlight and water. You can spray today, come back tomorrow, do a test and find nothing.'' Anvil and Scourge, which authorities in the New York region are spraying this year, also break down quickly, he said.</p>
        <p>Spraying is pretty much accepted in Miami-Dade because an uncontrolled mosquito population would make life there unbearable. Dragonflies, birds and bats eat the pests, but would not starve without them. ''I suspect if mosquitoes disappeared, the ecosystem would not be seriously damaged,'' Mr. Nelms said. ''They have just been very successful in reproducing and avoiding mankind, and transmitting diseases and all other kinds of misery.''</p>
        <p>But they are here to stay. ''We can't eradicate them. That would be impossible. Pretty much the best we can do is control them. Like weeds in a lawn.''</p>
