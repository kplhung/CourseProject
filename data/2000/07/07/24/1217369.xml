        <p>Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the conservative radio host who has been the target of a nationwide protest by gay groups, has unleashed a counteroffensive aimed at retaining her advertisers.</p>
        <p>The campaign by Dr. Schlessinger, the second highest rated talk show host on radio after Rush Limbaugh, came as her syndicator disclosed  just how many sponsors have left the program because of the protest. Kraig T. Kitchin, the president and chief operating officer of Premiere Radio Networks, said the show has lost 12 brands, or nearly 10 percent, of its national advertisers.</p>
        <p>Pressure on the sponsors began to mount in April, after months of protests failed to persuade the Paramount Television Group to back away from plans to produce a new syndicated TV show starring Dr. Schlessinger, who has described homosexuality as ''deviant'' and derivative of ''biological error.'' The show is to make its debut Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>In May, one of the first advertisers on the TV program, Procter &amp; Gamble, dropped its sponsorship. Radio sponsors began dropping immediately after that, though Paramount executives said no other advertisers have abandoned the TV show.</p>
        <p>Underscoring the gravity of the situation, Dr. Schlessinger last week began urging her listeners to start a letter and e-mail campaign thanking those sponsors who have remained with her radio show, and urged them to buy the sponsors' products. Dr. Schlessinger, who had previously been relatively passive amid the attacks, also announced that she will begin making on-air plugs for the sponsors who have stayed with her.</p>
        <p>In a letter addressed to her listeners, which was posted on her Web site DrLaura.com, Dr. Schlessinger painted her fight as a heated battle over family values, saying, ''folks who don't share our beliefs about what's right for children and the family are trying to disrupt our relationship.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, in a brief telephone interview, she said, ''I think anybody who has traditional values has been put on notice that if they express their values, they'll be put under attack.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Schlessinger's offensive represents her first public attempt to dam the flow of ad dollars from her radio advice program, which draws an estimated 18 million listeners weekly.</p>
        <p>Those that have severed their ties with Dr. Schlessinger include some of the largest corporations in the nation: Toys ''R'' Us, United Airlines, AT&amp;T, Kraft, General Foods and Xerox.</p>
        <p>Two more advertisers ceased sponsorship of her radio show during the first two weeks of July. One, SkyTel, the wireless company, said it was doing so amid an overall retreat from talk radio, though a spokeswoman could not name any show other than Dr. Schlessinger's for which it was a sponsor.</p>
        <p>Another, the Geico insurance company, said in a statement that its withdrawal from the program was in direct response to the controversy, adding, ''Geico is an equal opportunity employer and does not condone discrimination of any type.''</p>
        <p>Priceline.com and Natrol -- on whose board Mr. Kitchin sits -- as well as a Web site called Supportkids.com, are among those that have stuck with the program.</p>
        <p>The continued success of the protest campaign against Dr. Schlessinger -- led by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and a group called Stopdrlaura -- has been notable. The actions have reflected the growing political and economic power of gays, who are now exercising the sort of influence on the entertainment industry that conservative groups have in the past.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schlessinger has said she believes she is being unfairly targeted, claiming that her statements about gays are being taken out of context and that she is simply espousing family values. She has said that while she opposes homosexuality and a ''gay activist agenda,'' she does not oppose gays.</p>
        <p>On Friday, during the brief telephone interview, she said she began her countercampaign in response to calls and letters from listeners asking her how they could help.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schlessinger said that she does not believe that her views are any different from those of Pope John Paul II, who recently stated that homosexuality goes ''against natural law.''</p>
        <p>''I don't see stopthepope.com, do you?'' she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schlessinger complained that the campaign against her has spilled over into her personal life, citing ''personal threats to me and letters sent to neighbors with no return address telling them to accost me verbally.''</p>
        <p>''I think it's a pretty disgusting, relentless attack on my life, on my career, on my work,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But the groups were unapologetic about their campaign and said it would continue.</p>
        <p>''We are letting all advertisers for Dr. Laura know about the rhetoric,'' said John Aravosis, co-founder of stopdrlaura.com, which keeps tabs on developments with her radio and television programs. ''If they think that Dr. Laura is bad for business, it's their choice -- it's a free country and a free market.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, he said, he would like to see Paramount cease production of the Dr. Laura show.</p>
        <p>Yet the television show is suffering much less than the radio program. Despite heavy pressure on the television stations that have agreed to show the program -- which is expected to reach 97 percent of the country -- so far none has tried to break its agreement.</p>
        <p>And despite loud complaints even from within its own ranks, Paramount said it is sticking with the program. In fact, production started last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kitchin of Premiere said he was confident that all of the sponsors would return to the radio show, which he said is still financially healthy. But that is only if and when the controversy dies down. ''There are some who have said, 'The heat's a little hot in this kitchen, give us a call when it cools off,' '' he said.</p>
