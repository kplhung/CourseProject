        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Struggle Over Certified Teachers'' (editorial, July 19):</p>
        <p>If my suburban school district began losing its best teachers to New York City as a result of New York's  shrinking the gap in teacher pay, I'd vote to increase teacher compensation by whatever amount was needed to retain the best teachers.</p>
        <p>Thus, it seems to me that your proposal would not improve the caliber of teachers in the New York schools by any appreciable degree, although it would raise education costs throughout the region.</p>
        <p>Of course, if you were to pay significant bonuses to those teachers whose students performed better than earlier performances and demographics predicted, suburban districts would find it difficult to abandon their solely seniority-based compensation systems to retain younger, harder-working teachers.</p>
