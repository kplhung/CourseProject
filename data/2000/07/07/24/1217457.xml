        <p>New York City's war on the West Nile virus is intensifying, with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announcing yesterday that the city planned to add helicopters to its arsenal of mosquito-killing tools and would expand its ground-based pesticide campaign to include parts of Brooklyn as well as Staten Island and Queens.</p>
        <p>The escalating effort in New York City echoes steps being taken by local and state governments throughout the New York area.</p>
        <p>The virus, which killed 7 people and seriously sickened 55 others last year, has not been detected in people this year. But at least 40 infected birds and 3 pools of infected mosquitoes have been found in New York City and 8 neighboring counties in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the authorities said. At the end of last month, the virus had been confirmed in only a few birds in Bergen County, N.J., and Rockland County, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani yesterday added two birds in Queens to the count of West Nile cases: an infected dead crow  found this month in Richmond Hill and a dead merlin found in Woodhaven, near the Brooklyn border.</p>
        <p>To try to prevent the mosquito-borne virus from spreading to people, the city plans to extend its ground spraying tomorrow to a two-mile radius around the spots where the birds were found. This treatment, using sprayers mounted on trucks, is intended to kill adult mosquitoes and would follow ground spraying tonight in northeastern Queens and in part of Staten Island, areas where several infected birds have been found.</p>
        <p>Spraying began last week in the Rossville and Westerleigh sections of Staten Island, after the virus was confirmed in two crows on July 17.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration also announced yesterday that the city was seeking state permission to turn to aerial spraying for the first time this year. Helicopters would be used only in the wetlands of Staten Island to spread a bacterial larvicide, a substance considered nonhazardous to humans and most wildlife, except for mosquito larvae. Aerial spraying last year covered much of New York City, with a more toxic pesticide.</p>
        <p>New York City started to place larvicide in city storm drains and other artificial waterways in the early spring, to try to kill as many larvae as possible before they became adult mosquitoes. But the marshy areas where mosquitoes also thrive are difficult to reach, so applying larvicide poses a particular problem in Staten Island, which is 20 percent wetlands, requiring the aerial spraying.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said a dispute the city had on Friday with federal and state environmental officials had been resolved, with regulators allowing the city to spread pesticides on land closer to marshes in Staten Island, particularly around the Gateway National Recreation Area. Spraying had been prohibited in those areas because of concern about the effect on aquatic creatures and wildlife.</p>
        <p>Dr. Neal L. Cohen, New York City's health commissioner, who joined Mr. Giuliani yesterday morning at a news conference at the city's emergency operations center in Lower Manhattan, said the state had eased its stand ''in the face of a public health threat.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, West Nile-related spraying is set to start around 8 tonight in Stamford, Darien and New Canaan, Conn., after officials announced on Saturday that infected mosquitoes had been found in Stamford. It was the first confirmed case of an infected bird or mosquito in Connecticut this year.</p>
        <p>In northern New Jersey, where  infected crows have been found in Bergen, Hudson and Middlesex Counties, health officials are starting weekly checks on local hospitals, to increase monitoring for any possible human cases. Hudson County also plans to do aerial spraying of a mosquito larvicide tomorrow, the fourth such treatment since May.</p>
        <p>And in New York, spraying is set for Suffolk and Rockland Counties tonight, and for Westchester County tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani, as health officials in other communities have done, urged residents not to overreact, saying the city was merely following its plan to intensify the battle against mosquitoes as the presence of the virus is confirmed.</p>
        <p>''People should not be alarmed, they should not be concerned,'' he said. ''These are all things that we assumed we would have to do.''</p>
        <p>Anthony B. Iton, director of the Stamford Department of Health and Social Services, said that because most mosquitoes do not fly far from where they are born, area residents have a clear incentive to help prevent the spread of the virus. They can clean out roof drains, chlorinate pools and clear yards of old tires, plastic containers and other items in which water might collect and serve as a mosquito breeding ground.</p>
        <p>''Most likely, a mosquito that bites you in your backyard was born and bred in your property,'' Mr. Iton said.</p>
        <p>The rapid escalation of confirmed cases of infected birds or mosquitoes, while disconcerting to the public, has brought some comfort to public health officials by proving that the surveillance system set up to detect the virus is working.</p>
        <p>Last year, health officials did not intensely monitor bird populations, as they learned about the presence of the virus only shortly before Labor Day. Birds do not spread the virus to humans, but as it passes back and forth between mosquitoes and birds, the concentration of the virus in a particular area intensifies and can spread to a larger geographic area. So by quickly identifying areas where infected birds or mosquitoes are present, health officials hope to limit any human infections.</p>
        <p>But the increase in cases has offered a definitive answer to the question of whether the virus can live through the winter.</p>
        <p>''Seeing the infected birds is certainly not alarming or surprising,'' said James S. Blumenstock, senior assistant commissioner at the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services. ''But it certainly has confirmed the fact that the virus could and would survive a winter.''</p>
