        <p>A 43-year-old Long Island man who might have been trying to get revenge for an assault on his daughter stormed a house and opened fire yesterday, injuring two people, then killed himself when cornered by the police, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The man, William Mosca of Sound Beach, forced his way into the house on Berard Boulevard in Oakdale about 11:20 a.m. holding a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun, demanded to see one of the occupants, then started shooting, the Suffolk County police said.</p>
        <p>He fired 15 rounds and struck Gregory Malfer, 25, and Daniel Dellapina, 16, once each, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mosca drove away on his motorcycle and was spotted and chased by the police on the Northern State Parkway until he fell off the motorcycle as he tried to pull onto a shoulder, the police said.</p>
        <p>When the police ordered him to drop his gun, Mr. Mosca shot himself in the head and was pronounced dead at the scene, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malfer, whom the police said Mr. Mosca may have suspected in an assault on his daughter, was in serious condition at University Medical Center in Stony Brook, a hospital official said. Mr. Dellapina was discharged from the hospital.</p>
