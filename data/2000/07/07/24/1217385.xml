        <p>Seven months after this country's first military coup, Ivoirians voted today on a new constitution intended to restore civilian rule by laying out the guidelines for elections starting in September.</p>
        <p>Delays and other problems for some of Ivory Coast's 4.8 million voters were substantial enough that balloting was extended until Monday. But with the country's three major parties calling for a yes in the referendum, a new constitution was expected to be adopted eventually.</p>
        <p>The voting took place after the country's military rulers declared a state of emergency stretching from Friday to Tuesday. There were no reports of violence tonight. Still, most store owners had chosen to remain closed throughout the day; fearing looting, some store owners in a popular neighborhood had moved their goods to stores in the wealthy corner of Riviera.</p>
        <p>''I am afraid,'' said Laure Nessou, 28, who had gone to vote at 7 a.m. but had still not cast her ballot by 9 a.m because of technical delays in the neighborhood of Yopougon. ''I wanted to vote early and go home quickly. I'm going to stay home all day.''</p>
        <p>Gen. Robert Guei, the leader of the junta that has ruled this West African nation since last Christmas, has been campaigning hard in favor of the proposed constitution, which was drawn up by a committee set up by the military rulers. General Guei personally made last-minute changes to the text, tightening the requirements for candidates in presidential elections.</p>
        <p>The move was seen as an attempt by the general, who is widely believed to want to run for the presidency, to exclude a rival, Alassane Ouattara, a former prime minister and deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund. If the draft constitution is approved, an election for president will be held on Sept. 17, followed by parliamentary and municipal elections.</p>
        <p>''It is the people who drew up this constitution,'' General Guei said after casting his ballot. ''I don't see any reason why the yes vote would not prevail.''</p>
        <p>If a yes vote did not seem in doubt, more uncertain was whether the referendum would draw a turnout large enough to give the document indisputable validity. The proposed constitution includes many changes, from lowering the voting age to 18 from 21 to granting immunity from prosecution to the coup and junta leaders. They seized power in December after a mutiny in the military over low pay, charging that President Henri Konan Bedie was creating ethnic division in the country.</p>
        <p>But the text's most crucial changes focus on who can become a candidate for president in the Ivory Coast. According to the draft constitution, a presidential candidate must be born in the Ivory Coast of a father and mother born in the Ivory Coast; what's more, a candidate must have never availed himself of another nationality.</p>
        <p>Opponents of Mr. Ouattara, including the toppled president, Mr. Bedie, have said that his father was born in neighboring Burkina Faso and that he once held Burkinabe citizenship. Mr. Ouattara, who has always denied those claims, called on his supporters to endorse the draft constitution under which he said he was fully eligible to run for president.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, many of his followers still saw the draft constitution as an attempt by Christian southerners to exclude Muslim northerners like Mr. Ouattara. Many said today that they were voting no.</p>
        <p>After casting his ballot today, Mr. Ouattara did not disclose how he had voted, saying only, ''We must take the next steps in peace, Ivoirians must be allowed to choose their president in a transparent manner, and candidates must be permitted to participate in the contest.''</p>
        <p>At a voting station in the sprawling neighborhood of Abobo, Muhammad Sisse, 36, and Fanny Abdoulaye, 28, said they were card-carrying members of Mr. Ouattara's party. They said they would vote no because they saw the draft constitution as a way to marginalize Muslim northerners like themselves. ''I am voting no for my children,'' Mr. Sisse said. ''Why haven't we started voting yet? They want to discourage us and make us go home. It's the military that does not want to leave power.''</p>
        <p>Waiting in the same line, Blaise Kouadio Yao, 29, said he belonged to the party of former President Bedie. He was going to vote yes, he said, because he wanted to make sure an Ivoirian became president and he considered Mr. Ouattara an outsider.</p>
        <p>''We cannot confide the direction of this country to an opportunist,'' Mr. Yao said. ''The Ivory Coast is for Ivoirians.''</p>
