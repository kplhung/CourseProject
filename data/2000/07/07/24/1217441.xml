        <p>Two large advertisers have named Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising in New York to handle their accounts.</p>
        <p>Computer Associates International in Islandia, N.Y., chose the agency as the first to handle its global account, with billings estimated at $100 million.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a review that had been narrowed to Y.&amp; R. Advertising and one other finalist, BBDO Worldwide in New York, which is a unit of the Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>Two other agencies, also in New York, were eliminated last week: D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, part of the B Com3  Group, and DDB Worldwide, part of Omnicom. Schell/ Mullaney in New York previously worked for Computer Associates.</p>
        <p>And the Pennzoil-Quaker State International Corporation in Houston named Y.&amp; R. Advertising as its international agency of record, handling television, radio and print campaigns in markets outside the United States. Billings for the assignment, previously divided among many local agencies, were not publicly disclosed.</p>
        <p>The decision came after an informal five-month review that involved talks with agencies including Leo Burnett, part of B Com3 , and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.</p>
        <p>Media duties will be handled by a Y.&amp; R. Advertising sibling, the Media Edge in New York.</p>
        <p>Pennzoil-Quaker State spends $80 million on ads in the United States, created by GSD&amp;M in Austin, Tex., part of Omnicom.</p>
        <p>THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA  Correction:  July 28, 2000, Friday  An entry in the Addenda listing of the Media Business page on Monday about the choice of Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising by Pennzoil-Quaker State International as its international agency of record referred imprecisely to the company's agency roster in the United States. GSD&amp;M in Austin, Tex., part of the Omnicom Group, creates ads for Pennzoil motor oil, but those for Quaker State in the United States are created by the Tucker Partnership in New York.</p>
