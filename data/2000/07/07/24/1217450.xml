        <p>A full generation after it helped install Edward I. Koch in Gracie Mansion, The New York Post has become a conservative fixture in city politics. However straightforward its news articles, its headlines and columnists tend to goad, gloat and cheer.</p>
        <p>So for politics and media watchers, The Post was doing what came naturally on July 15 when it became the first news organization to publish the accusation that Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first lady and Democratic candidate for Senate, had used an anti-Semitic slur against a campaign aide 26 years ago.</p>
        <p>''I love the people at The Post,'' Mr. Koch observed. ''But they hate Hillary. It wouldn't matter if she turned into Mother Teresa; they'd hate her.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's political aides, frequently put on the defensive by The Post in this media-saturated Senate race, might agree.</p>
        <p>And they could even cite evidence for the Post-hates-Hillary theory, such as the Page 1 ''Shame on Hillary'' headline after the first lady's embrace of Suha Arafat, the wife of the Palestinian leader.</p>
        <p>But hate is too simple a word for what drives The Post. Former Post staff members and some workers on the Clinton campaign and that of her opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, see a more complex dynamic at work. Though some may say the newspaper flaunts an ideology, it also has a ferocious appetite for scoops and an ever-broadening base of coverage. Partisanship will always have a place in a news outlet controlled by Rupert Murdoch, chairman of The Post's parent company, the News Corporation.  Still, the paper's day-to-day coverage is the product of journalistic adrenaline -- the desire to be quicker, sharper, better.</p>
        <p>''When one of the papers get a scoop on something, they are voracious on following it up,'' said Dan McLagan, communications director for the Lazio campaign. ''That's true of The Post, The Daily News and The New York Times.'' Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Indeed, conservative critics have long defended The Post, saying its news coverage seems biased only to those with a built-in liberal frame of reference. Conservatives who see The New York Times as among the voices of a liberal city say The Post is a necessary ideological counterweight.</p>
        <p>George Arzt, a public relations consultant and former City Hall bureau chief of The Post, said that the paper's first rule was ''not to be beaten'' to a story. The second, ''To make sure your paper sells.'' And then, ''to make sure your paper is interesting -- that it has buzz.''</p>
        <p>As for ideology, he added: ''If a story fits, perfect. If it doesn't fit, they have to examine it. If it doesn't fit and it's going to sell papers, they go with it.''</p>
        <p>By his measure, the allegations about an anti-Semitic slur fit nicely. By the measure of The Post's editor, Xana Antunes -- and her counterparts at The Daily News -- they were simply a good news story. Ms. Antunes said she first learned about midday on July 14, a Friday, that the Internet gossip columnist Matt Drudge had posted the item on his Web site. On Saturday, The Post ran four pieces about the allegation, with the Page 1 headline ''Hillary Book Brouhaha.''</p>
        <p>As The Post noted, the book was published by HarperCollins, another Murdoch property. Ms. Antunes said: ''We've bent over backwards to ascertain the facts, to be fair to all parties. As the week rolled out we devoted a substantial amount of space to analyzing the varying versions, the inconsistencies.''</p>
        <p>The Daily News ran its account of the accusation against Mrs. Clinton the same day, but not in the first papers off the press. But both newspapers made the same point: that while the allegation might be false, it brought back memories of Mrs. Clinton's embrace of Mrs. Arafat last year and might hurt her with Jewish voters. Then The News published an editorial on Sunday attacking Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>And so the story was off and running.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton quickly called a news conference at which she denied the accusation. President Clinton called Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the co-publisher of The Daily News, to do the same. The denials, in turn, put the issue into general circulation in all news outlets, including The New York Times, Newsday, The Buffalo News and The Times Union of Albany.</p>
        <p>On the Fox News cable channel, another Murdoch property, the disputed slur was the top item of discussion on Fox shows like ''Hannity and Colmes'' and ''The O'Reilly Factor.'' But it was also fodder for the shows of its rivals, CNN and MSNBC.</p>
        <p>John Moody, the vice president for news at Fox News Channel, disputes the notion that the various News Corporation outlets coordinate coverage or carry out ideological directives. The Daily News and local television news, he pointed out, were just as interested in the slur story.</p>
        <p>But The Post was first. By week's end, The Post had written more about the incident than any other newspaper; news stories questioning the credibility of her accusers and featuring the defense of her onetime rival in the Senate race, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and commentaries skewering her.</p>
        <p>What drives it all? David Seifman, The Post's City Hall bureau chief, said: ''Every time people think there's some sort of political agenda at work to place a story or cover a story, they're generally wrong. Almost always. The agenda at work is to beat the competition and to get a better story and to get it first.''</p>
        <p>The past year has provided evidence to support the views of Mr. Seifman and Mr. Arzt. After years of backing Mr. Giuliani, The Post was unflinching in covering the furor when the mayor released the juvenile criminal record of Patrick M. Dorismond, an unarmed man fatally shot by the police. Then in May, when Mr. Giuliani announced before television cameras that his marriage was over, The Post's front page featured  an image of Mr. Giuliani's wife, Donna Hanover, looking grief stricken, under the headline ''Bitter Tears.''</p>
        <p>John Rocker, the Atlanta Braves pitcher whose xenophobic remarks in a magazine interview offended a broad swath of New Yorkers, has been tagged by The Post as everything from a ''Hothead Hurler'' to the ''Ku Klux Kloser'' -- even though conservative columnists have championed him as a victim of repressive liberal orthodoxies.</p>
        <p>Regardless of ideology, The Post, a circulation underdog in a city barely able to support two populist tabloids, continually tries to broaden its appeal. It has a daily circulation of about 436,000 copies; 90 percent of its customers buy it from newsstands or vending boxes. (About 80 percent of the Daily News's circulation of 730,000 comes from street sales. For The New York Times, street sales represent about 40 percent of a circulation of 1.1 million.)</p>
        <p>What do readers buy? Since April, five events have dominated The Post's front page: the New York Senate race; the New York Knicks' fate in the N.B.A. playoffs; Mr. Rocker's return to town; the death of Cardinal John O'Connor and the installation of his successor, and Mayor Giuliani's decision to abandon his marriage and the Senate race.</p>
        <p>Of these, only the death and funeral of Cardinal O'Connor caused a noticeable uptick in circulation, according to Joseph Gilkey, The Post's circulation director.</p>
        <p>So The Post's core readers come back to the newsstands day after day not for politics, particularly, but for a diet heavy on sports, business, crime and politics. Don Forst, editor of The Village Voice, said that The Post's genius was its ability to build ''hot button'' personalities into its coverage: Mr. Rocker, the Rev. Al Sharpton or Yasir Arafat. And Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''Can you think of anyone who is more newsworthy?'' asked Ms. Antunes, The Post's editor, speaking Friday about the depth of coverage of Mrs. Clinton. ''To have the president's wife running for a seat -- I can't imagine someone who deserves to be mentioned more.''</p>
        <p>Presidential candidates, perhaps. Last October, a similarly explosive, uncertain and distant allegation -- almost immediately discredited -- surfaced in a new book about George W. Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner. The Post's initial coverage was limited to a single article on Page 2. A few days later, The Post reported that the author was a convicted felon.</p>
        <p>Anyone looking at back issues of The Post for the past six months would find Mrs. Clinton's name -- frequently cut to ''Hill'' for headline purposes -- more than once a week under the bylines of its news commentators Steve Dunleavy and Andrea Peyser, and often linked with Mr. Sharpton and Mrs. Arafat -- two other hot-button figures for Post readers.</p>
        <p>The Post's trademark gossip column, Page Six, and its editorial page also mention Mrs. Clinton often. (The most liberal news commentator, Jack Newfield, has been the least likely to mention the first lady.)</p>
        <p>In one column in April, Ms. Peyser wrote, ''the time is at hand to set aside our petty hatreds and visceral fears, and to make an objective, dispassionate examination of the Yankee-loving, Suha Arafat-kissing, Al Sharpton-pandering woman from Chappaqua.'' More recently, another column was published under the headline: ''Just What Is It About a Phony Like Hillary That Makes Mm Skin Crawl?''</p>
        <p>Which, then, is the core of Post coverage, partisanship or a competitive journalistic spirit, coupled with a respect for fairness?</p>
        <p>Ken Sunshine, a public relations consultant who was once an aide to Mayor David N. Dinkins, said he would vote for partisanship. The Post, he said, ''sets a certain style.'' He added, ''When the networks come to town, The Post is always quoted. Part of it is their headlines. Part of it is the outrageousness with which they sometimes cover stories.'' He believes ideology is the driving force at the newspaper.</p>
        <p>But for Ms. Antunes, the editor, things are much simpler than that. The news coverage of the slur accusations, she pointed out, included prominently displayed articles in which Mr. Koch and Mayor Giuliani dismissed them. ''You report the news, gather the facts, print what's going to sell the newspaper the next day.''</p>
