        <p>Camp David Talks Seen at Crucial Point  President Clinton returned to negotiations at Camp David and American officials suggested that the talks, now centered on the future of Jerusalem, could break apart in the next day or solidify into a deal.</p>

        <p>Refugees Remain Scattered  One million refugees are scattered throughout 40 or more camps in Azerbaijan, where promised oil riches have yet to materialize and per capita income is less than $2,000 a year. The refugees remain victims of a little-noticed war, insufficiently cared for by their government and on the verge of abandonment by international aid organizations.</p>

        <p>Ivory Coast Referendum  Citizens of the Ivory Coast voted on a new constitution intended to restore civilian rule by laying out the guidelines for elections starting in September. The vote came seven months after a military coup.</p>

        <p>Expanding U.N. Refugee Aid  The leading United Nations relief official, Carolyn McAskie, said she wanted to look for ways to bring United Nations agencies into a common effort to pay more attention to the plight of victims of war known as ''internally displaced persons'' -- who are not refugees because they have not crossed international borders.</p>

        <p>Leaders Promise Debt Relief  The leaders of eight industrial nations concluded their annual economic summit meeting in Japan with a broad commitment to help poor countries reduce their debt burden and increase their access to better education, health care and information technology.</p>

        <p>German President Has Surgery  President Johannes Rau of Germany, left, was in stable condition after undergoing an operation to replace a stomach artery, his office said. Kurt Biedenkopf, the president of the upper house of Parliament, will temporarily handle his duties in the largely ceremonial post.</p>

        <p>China Official Visits Pakistan  The Chinese foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, during a visit to Pakistan, said that improving relations with India would not come at the expense of China's ties with Pakistan, a longtime ally.</p>

        <p>Gun Control Groups Mobilize for Elections  The gun control movement has begun its most ambitious campaign to raise money, recruit foot soldiers and build public support for stronger gun laws in preparation for this fall's national elections.</p>

        <p>Philadelphia's Two Worlds  An 80-year-old neighborhood's collapse into its own unstable landfill is stark evidence that the Philadelphia renaissance that is attracting the Republican conventioneers is a tale of two cities: the glittering downtown of new hotels and trendy restaurants, and frayed working-class neighborhoods like Logan, to the north.</p>

        <p>Fighting Drought in Texas  Volunteers in Throckmorton, Tex., are working to dig a 21-mile underground pipeline to connect with a water system in nearby Elbert. Officials say Throckmorton's water supply will dry up in 50 to 60 days, if drought-like conditions persist.</p>

        <p>Checking Up on Cheney  A cardiac surgeon in Houston said that Gov. George W. Bush and his father, former President George Bush, had asked him on Friday to consult by telephone with one of Richard B. Cheney's physicians and help determine if Mr. Cheney ''was up to a strenuous campaign.'' Mr. Cheney, the former defense secretary, emerged in recent days as a leading contender for the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket.</p>

        <p>Energy Secretary Off List  Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is no longer on anyone's list of likely Democratic vice-presidential nominees. On the heels of a scandal at Los Alamos, possibly involving espionage, two computer hard drives containing nuclear secrets went missing at Los Alamos, gasoline prices skyrocketed and Congress turned on the former House member with a vengeance. ''I believe in fate,'' he said.</p>

        <p>Report Critical of F.B.I.  A whistle-blower's manuscript that the government suppressed on security grounds contains little new information, but strongly criticizes the F.B.I. as having mishandled the government's investigation into whether China stole nuclear secrets from the United States.</p>

        <p>Census Survey Shows Explosion in Immigration  Foreign-born residents now make up 40 percent of New York City's population, an analysis of United States Census Bureau figures shows. The figures are from a survey taken in 1999 by the Census Bureau.</p>

        <p>EDUCATION</p>
        <p>Exam Too Simple, Teachers Say  Teachers in New York are complaining that the new, rigorous Regents exams are so easy, and the scoring system so lenient, that even their worst students pass easily. The tests, once reserved for the state's most ambitious students, are being revamped to match new standards, and many teachers had feared the failure rates would soar.</p>

        <p>Answer to a Wage Question  As labor shortages and competition for workers drive up wages in one city, companies have shifted work or have expanded in another location, where the same tasks can be done at lower pay. This movement helps to answer the question of how the nation has managed to achieve its lowest unemployment rate since the 1960's and yet not experience as much upward pressure on wages as it has during past booms.</p>
