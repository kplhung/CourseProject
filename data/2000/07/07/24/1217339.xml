        <p>This time next week, ''Live with Regis &amp; Kathie Lee'' will be known as ''Live with Regis.'' After sitting next to Regis Philbin each morning for 15 years, drinking coffee and often going on and on about her children, Kathie Lee Gifford is leaving the late morning talk show to pursue a career in acting and singing.</p>
        <p>How badly will her absence be felt? Not clear, say those she is leaving behind.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Philbin was not at the top of the heap these days -- as host of ABC's ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' -- the loss of Ms. Gifford  could have caused some major agita. After all, the sparring banter of the two co-hosts has helped ''Live'' maintain its place as one of the most popular syndicated talk shows on television. But executives said they believe Mr. Philbin's popularity will hold the show up through the transition.</p>
        <p>Likewise, if Kathie Lee were not Kathie Lee, executives with the program may also have had more reason to worry. Ms. Gifford's perky, pesky television style is not for everyone, they concede. And she has had her share of controversy (starting with a little scandal over underage labor and a Wal-Mart clothing line). The negative attention she has received also contributed to her decision to leave, Ms. Gifford has said.</p>
        <p>''Kathie Lee is extremely popular,'' said Michael Gelman, the program's executive producer. ''At the same time, she can be polarizing. She kind of prides herself on that. The downside to that is, some people love you and some people don't like you.''</p>
        <p>Without her on set, he said, he believes it is possible that ''we can get a bigger sampling.''</p>
        <p>So far, executives at Buena Vista Television, the division of the Walt Disney Company that syndicates the program, have been unable to find an adequate replacement for Ms. Gifford and will use guest co-hosts until they do. That is expected to take many weeks.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gifford's last appearance on the show will be on Friday.</p>
