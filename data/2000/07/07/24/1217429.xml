        <p>For football players struggling to make the Jets roster this summer, every play, every chance to catch a coach's eye, is paramount. Drop a makable catch and you could be cut by tomorrow. Fail to separate from a defender or make the wrong cut on a pass route and prepare for the biting words of Coach Al Groh.</p>
        <p>But it is the plays cornerback Aaron Glenn did not make in the first week of training camp that define why he is such a crucial element if the Jets are to return to contention in the American Football Conference East this fall.</p>
        <p>On the final play of Thursday's practice, Glenn was beaten by receiver Dedric Ward for a 30-yard touchdown pass that Glenn barely missed getting a hand on. Glenn stomped around like a child in the throes of a tantrum. He muttered and then, as his teammates huddled, Glenn threw his helmet to the ground. Was this July or December?</p>
        <p>''It was a busted coverage, and I don't like that,'' Glenn said a day later, still furious with himself. ''I saw the ball the whole way and tried to make a perfect play. When I have a chance to make the play, I want to make it, even if it's practice.''</p>
        <p>Then, during Saturday's no-tackling scrimmage, after he had been beaten by receiver Wayne Chrebet on a fade for a touchdown during two-minute drill practice, Glenn's frustration bubbled to the surface again. Glenn dived for a Ray Lucas pass and grabbed the ball, breaking up the play. But he went out of bounds, his interception nullified. He bounced up and screamed in outrage at the official ''Come on!''.</p>
        <p>Glenn, to be sure, is in no danger of losing his starting job. He was still hampered last season by a severely sprained ankle he sustained in December 1998, but Glenn, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, remains one of the best cover corners in the league and last season had three interceptions. Glenn said he had not fully recovered from the ankle sprain last season and feels that only now is he back at full strength and able to be the anchor of what is expected to be one of the Jets' best units.</p>
        <p>''I'm hungry to get back to being the corner I picture myself as being,'' Glenn said. ''I let worrying about the injury and my career linger. But now I've got everything back, my speed and quickness. The only thing I care about as long as I'm playing well is my family.''</p>
        <p>Groh sees Glenn's outbursts and his obvious intensity this early in the season as the norm. ''That's the way he's practiced every play since we started the off-season training program,'' Groh said. ''He's highly competitive, very combative on every ball. He's very demanding of himself. An average player can be good some days, but the special ones are the same every day. Aaron's the same every day. Anybody who wants to watch how to be a standout in the league should follow him.''</p>
        <p>Glenn will have the chance to lead a talent-laden secondary that veteran Otis Smith said has ''a ton of talent back there.'' One of the few open positions entering camp is at free safety, with Omar Stoutmire battling Kevin Williams and Scott Frost for the job. The nickel back Ray Mickens will miss at least a week of practice with a bad hamstring, and Smith, who will turn 35 during the season, is a possible salary cap victim (he is scheduled to make $1.2 million this season).</p>
        <p>The depth, though -- Mickens is a still emerging player and the cornerback Marcus Coleman took Smith's job when he was injured last season and led the team in interceptions and passes defensed -- makes almost any concern about the unit an overreaction this early.</p>
        <p>Not for Glenn. It is only July, but not too soon for Glenn to loathe a missed coverage, to recoil at any premature praise of the defenders.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to go off and say we're the best thing happening and then we give up 20 touchdowns,'' Glenn said. ''We still have a lot of work ahead of us. We've got to get together as a group. Once we get that down I think we'll be productive.''</p>
        <p>''We have a big corner, a cover corner,'' he added, referring to Coleman, ''a smart guy in Omar Stoutmire, and then we've got an extra linebacker in Victor Green. We've just got to put it all together.''</p>
