        <p>Trying to project a generous and efficient image before their party's convention, Republican leaders in Congress are passing spending bills at a whirlwind pace.</p>
        <p>In some cases, Republican lawmakers even seem willing to increase spending on programs that are not usually first on their agenda.</p>
        <p>Stung by accusations of being a ''do-nothing Congress'' that cannot govern, House and Senate leaders have pushed through a series of spending measures with a speed that has surprised many longtime Congress watchers.</p>
        <p>''There have been other years when they've completed their work on appropriation bills by the end of the fiscal year,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the Urban Institute. ''I don't ever remember there being this sort of turbo-charged activity in July.''</p>
        <p>When the House convenes this week, its leaders expect members to approve the last of 13 bills that finance the federal government, a $414 million spending measure for the District of Columbia.</p>
        <p>Should that measure be approved as expected, it would be the first time in recent memory that the House had passed all 13 spending bills before its August recess.</p>
        <p>While the Senate has not moved quite as quickly, it has approved 9 of the 13 bills and is expected to approve 2 more this week.</p>
        <p>''Nobody has ever done this many, this quick in less time,'' said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, as he entered the House chamber on Thursday night for one of the votes.</p>
        <p>It is not only the speed that is remarkable. This week negotiators from the Senate and House, and possibly the Clinton administration, will try to reach agreement on a mammoth bill that finances the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services.</p>
        <p>As those talks begin, House leaders have already signaled a willingness to increase spending in the bill by $6 billion, bringing the total for discretionary spending to more than $106 billion.</p>
        <p>That is about the same amount President Clinton had requested for the agencies.</p>
        <p>The willingness of Republican lawmakers to spend more on domestic programs helps illustrate how the party's outlook has changed. It is the result of the projected surplus of $2.2 trillion in the non-Social Security budget over the next 10 years, election year politics and the need to protect its slim majority in the House.</p>
        <p>Far from talking about dismantling the Department of Education, as they did after taking control of Congress five years ago, Republican leaders are now saying they would propose spending more money on education than Mr. Clinton had requested.</p>
        <p>''We don't want to be on the wrong side of education,'' said an aide to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois. ''The debate is going to be on who gets to spend the money and what it's spent on, not on us being against spending it.'' Still, John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said today that important differences remained.</p>
        <p>''They haven't funded our program to put more teachers in the classrooms,'' Mr. Podesta said on the ABC News program ''This Week.'' ''They haven't funded our program to repair crumbling schools. They haven't funded our program to demand more accountability from schools, to increase teacher standards, to provide after-school and summer school care.''</p>
        <p>Several conservatives in the Republican Party are unhappy because they believe the bills will push spending beyond the $600 billion limit on discretionary spending for the current fiscal year that Congress already has agreed to.</p>
        <p>''I think we're going to blow the doors off the Treasury,'' said Representative Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican and one of the chamber's most conservative members. ''I feel we're heading towards $640 billion in spending, maybe $650 billion.''</p>
        <p>Republicans are not the only ones who are acting in ways that belie recent rhetoric.</p>
        <p>Last week, large numbers of Democrats in the House and the Senate deserted their party's leadership and voted to repeal the estate tax and to cut taxes for married couples.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reischauer said the existence of the surplus meant that charges of fiscal irresponsibility could not be easily leveled against those who were advocating tax cuts or spending increases.</p>
        <p>''The Democrats are unsure that the promise of tax cuts won't suddenly catch hold with the electorate, so they're inching towards where the Republicans are,'' he said, ''and the Republicans are realizing that they don't want to go into an election with the president pounding on them for denying funds for things like education and the environment.</p>
        <p>None of this guarantees that there will not be a reprise of the bitter, end-of-the-fiscal year negotiations over the federal budget. Mr. Clinton has vowed to veto six of the spending bills, largely because he believes they do not provide enough money.</p>
        <p>Administration officials worry that House Republicans may add money to several bills in order to reach agreement with the Senate before the Republican National Convention. But without an agreement to spend beyond the $600 billion ceiling, other measures, like the one financing the Department of Housing and Urban Development, may be shortchanged.</p>
        <p>''If they start fixing bills to get them through before the recess, you've got to ask if there will be enough to fix all of them,'' said Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
