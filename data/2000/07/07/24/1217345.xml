        <p>Barbara Walters has decided to cancel an appearance by O. J. Simpson scheduled for Wednesday on ''The View,'' after being deluged with protests from viewers and members of the staff of the program.</p>

        <p>Barbara Walters has decided to cancel an appearance by O. J. Simpson scheduled for Wednesday on ''The View,'' after being deluged with protests from viewers and members of the staff of the program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simpson was booked last week to appear on the show, a syndicated daytime discussion program. Mr. Simpson has scheduled a number of television appearances this week in conjunction with the start of a Web site that will solicit money from the public for an opportunity to ask Mr. Simpson questions.</p>
        <p>The site will also sell memorabilia associated with Mr. Simpson, who was acquitted in 1995 of murdering his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman, but found liable later in a wrongful-death civil suit.</p>
        <p>Ms. Walters said in a telephone interview that she and Bill Geddie, who are co-executive producers of ''The View,'' had made the decision.</p>
        <p>''I received more very unhappy phone calls from viewers than I have in a very long time,'' Ms. Walters said. ''That was not the defining thing, but that troubled me.'' In addition, she said, she heard from a large number of people on show's production staff. ''They had very serious concerns about having O. J. on the show.''</p>
        <p>The concerns mainly dealt with giving Mr. Simpson a forum to defend himself and to promote the Web site, she said.</p>
        <p>She noted that she had often interviewed controversial figures, but said this situation was different because ''The View'' is a program that encourages open expressions of opinion by interviewers, unlike the interviews she does for ABC News programs.</p>
        <p>Also important were the opinions of two of the show's other hosts, Meredith Vieira and Joy Behar. ''Meredith and Joy both expressed their unhappiness about it on the air last week,'' Ms. Walters said. The fourth host, Star Jones, had indicated that she would be eager to talk to Mr. Simpson.</p>
        <p>Ms. Walters said she told Mr. Simpson's representatives of the cancellation and ''they took it very well.'' Brian Barry, Mr. Simpson's spokesman in conjunction with the Web site, did not return phone calls last weekend.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simpson is scheduled to appear on NBC's ''Today'' show tomorrow. The show has no plans to cancel that appearance, an NBC news spokeswoman, Alex Constantinople, said. Nor has ''Today'' received an unusual number of calls protesting his appearance, she said.</p>
        <p>He is scheduled to make other television appearances later in the week, on the Fox News cable channel, Court TV and others. None of the other channels is reporting second thoughts about booking him.</p>
        <p>Ms. Walters said: ''I am sensitive to the feelings of the other members of our program and our production staff. We don't need to do this. We don't need it for the ratings. It was just very uncomfortable.''</p>
