        <p>The strangest thing is happening at this year's Giants training camp. The team's offensive unit comes to the line of scrimmage during practice and the defensive players, for a change, do not instantly start calling out which play is about to be run.</p>
        <p>As the Giants' offense shifts, sending a running back to one flank, then shifts again, sending another running back in motion, the defenders sometimes even look flummoxed. Linebackers and defensive backs dash back and forth -- arms waving as they shout directives -- with the adjustments sometimes incomplete as the ball is snapped.</p>
        <p>This is not normal Giants training-camp behavior. Normal for the Giants has been the defense toying with the offense, a dominance that has made both sides uneasy. The defense lost confidence in the offense, and the offense just lost confidence.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the Giants promise a new-look offense with every training camp. But this week, listen to the players who know the Giants offense best: the Giants defenders.</p>
        <p>''They have made me uncomfortable out there because I have no idea what they're going to run sometimes,'' defensive end Michael Strahan said. ''Maybe that's a bad feeling for me on the field, but when I stop and think about it, it makes me feel good.''</p>
        <p>Cornerback Jason Sehorn said: ''It's not even the same offense. It's fun to watch. Two and three different looks before one play is run? That's completely different.''</p>
        <p>The mastermind of this metamorphosis is Sean Payton, the team's new offensive coordinator, who took over the play-calling duties last December. Coach Jim Fassel is still involved in every major offensive adaptation because offensive strategy is his lifeblood. But it has become Payton's brainchild to add many more formations and personnel groups that are nontraditional by Giants standards.</p>
        <p>After just three practices, the Giants have showed formations with three tight ends, no tight ends, four wide receivers, two backs and fullback Greg Comella, three wide receivers, two wide receivers -- usually with motion on every play. Having Ron Dayne, the team's top draft pick, at the head of a punishing running game is still part of the plans, but running backs Sean Bennett and Tiki Barber will have expanded receiving roles.</p>
        <p>Barber and Dayne could both be on the field when the Giants line up for the first play from scrimmage on opening day against Arizona, on Sept. 3. So what's the likely call? It may not be what you think.</p>
        <p>''There are going to be times when a screen or a reverse on first down is the right call,'' Payton said today.</p>
        <p>Consider a play from today's practice. Dayne and his likely backup, Joe Montgomery, were each split wide, like receivers on the line of scrimmage.</p>
        <p>The defense had apparently not seen that before because there were linebackers running for the sidelines in both directions. After the snap, quarterback Kerry Collins fired a crisp, quick pass underneath to Joe Jurevicius, who had been lined up in the slot, just off the tight end, for a 6-yard gain.</p>
        <p>The Giants are searching for diversification, trying to maximize a versatile group of running backs and receivers, and shed the bane of any offense: predictability. At the same time, they also drafted Dayne to resurrect a moribund running game.</p>
        <p>''If there's an occasional boo on third-and-3 because we give the ball to Ron Dayne, people have to understand that we need a running game,'' Payton said. ''The quarterback wants us to be able to run, that's for sure. There are a lot of changes, but the running game has to be effective and then everything else falls into place.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot going on. And we put new things in every day. But I tell the guys, 'Let's just get through today; it's early.' ''</p>
        <p>Payton is also a realist. It's a piecemeal process, and these will never be the run-and-shoot Giants.</p>
        <p>''You know, there's going to be a day when that wind is howling at Giants Stadium,'' he said smiling. ''And a well-executed power running game will look pretty good.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Center DUSTY ZEIGLER missed Sunday's practice after being poked in the eye Saturday. Three years ago, the Giants lost their starting center, BRIAN WILLIAMS, for the season after he was poked in the eye during training camp. The Giants have not said that Zeigler's injury is serious, but they are planning to send him to an eye specialist on Monday.</p>
