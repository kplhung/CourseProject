        <p>Jeremy Mayfield's race car, propped on a jack, was parked in a garage instead of in the winner's circle late this afternoon. The right front fender was charred. The right front tire was a shredded mass of rubber. Tough, grinding Pocono Raceway finally caught Mayfield today, then bit him hard.</p>
        <p>Five weeks after he won a race here by nudging aside the intimidating Dale Earnhardt on the last lap, Mayfield blew a tire midway through the final lap today and lost the Pennsylvania 500 to his Penske Racing teammate, Rusty Wallace.</p>
        <p>''I guess the track owed me one,'' Mayfield said afterward, forcing a smile. Mayfield, trying to become the fifth driver to win both Nascar Winston Cup races in a single season at Pocono, passed Wallace with 18 laps left in the 200-lap race and appeared to be sailing toward a much less controversial victory than the one June 19 over Earnhardt.</p>
        <p>Then Mayfield rolled over something. Exactly what that was, no one knew afterward. With Wallace and Jeff Burton chasing him into Turn 2 of the tricky tri-oval, Mayfield's tire went down fast. Wallace, as stunned as anyone, passed him for the lead and held off Burton for his first victory since March 26.</p>
        <p>''His car just hung a right and went straight up to the wall,'' Wallace said.</p>
        <p>The strange twist to this Pocono race was that Wallace caught Mayfield because he was racing Burton for second place. Stock car races are heavily influenced by aerodynamics. Two cars traveling together, one in front of the other, tend to go faster than a car running alone, even though Mayfield had a fast car and loves running here.</p>
        <p>''Any place that's real hard on a driver getting set up on, he excels at,'' said Peter Sospenzo, Mayfield's crew chief. Although Wallace took a gamble on his last pit stop by taking only two fresh tires instead of four, he and Burton, bumping each other all the way, caught Mayfield. A lead of eight car lengths suddenly became four, then two, then one.</p>
        <p>Wallace said Robin Pemberton, his crew chief, began yelling to Wallace over the radio: ''Keep digging! You're getting closer! You can win this!'' Still, both Wallace and Burton said they would not have passed Mayfield without the blown tire.</p>
        <p>How fitting that an equipment breakdown decided another long afternoon at Pocono. Thirteen cars left the race because of some kind of a breakdown, a Winston Cup season high by far.</p>
        <p>''We finished sixth by virtue of some other guys having problems,'' said Bobby Labonte, who now has a 53-point lead in the Winston Cup drivers standing over Dale Jarrett. ''I still think we were a little bit better, but we're still not as good as we need to be. All in all, though, it was a good day.''</p>
        <p>It was a good day because Earnhardt had another bad day here. He was chasing Jarrett for the lead on the 145th lap when his Chevrolet suddenly bobbled back and forth, almost as if he were swerving to avoid hitting something. Then his right front tire started to practically unravel.</p>
        <p>Earnhardt was in second place in the points race entering today, 45 points behind Labonte and 23 points ahead of Jarrett. He finished 25th today, and will stand 54 points behind Jarrett and 107 points behind Labonte entering the next Winston Cup race, the Brickyard 400 on Aug. 5 at Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>''That was one of our biggest worries, taking a big hit in the points,'' Earnhardt said. ''We were running too good to have that kind of a day.'' Jarrett led more laps than anyone else today and finished fourth, but he became the victim of trying to play it safe. He took four fresh tires on his last pit stop and fell from the lead into 13th place. Four fresh tires are supposed to be much better than two, but the tires performed poorly enough that Jarrett was never able to catch the leaders.</p>
        <p>''I'm thinking, 'Why are they doing that?' '' Wallace said. ''I've tried that one, and that didn't work.''</p>
        <p>No strategy seems to be foolproof at Pocono. The drivers won't have to work here again until next year, and they seemed to be in a particular hurry late this afternoon to drive their cars up to their trailers and join the postrace traffic jam.</p>
        <p>Mayfield never made it back to his trailer with his car.</p>
        <p>He walked briskly from his pit to his motor home in the Pocono infield. He said along the way that he thought no one had a better car than he did.</p>
        <p>Now he knows, from the other perspective, that the best cars do not always win.</p>
        <p>''We won the Pocono 499 and lost the Pocono 500,'' Mayfield said. ''Sometimes you have good luck, and sometimes you don't. Today, we didn't.''</p>
