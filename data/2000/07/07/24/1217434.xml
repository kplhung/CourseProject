        <p>The women's 800 meters produced a rare family affair today at the United States Olympic trials as Hazel Clark finished first in 1 minute 58.97 seconds, her sister-in-law Jearl Miles-Clark took second in 1:59.12 and her half-sister Joetta Clark-Diggs slipped into third by a hundredth of a second in 1:59.49.</p>
        <p>This apparently unprecedented family achievement overshadowed a world record of 15 feet 2 1/4 inches by Stacy Dragila in the women's pole vault, an American record of 12.33 seconds by Gail Devers in the 100 hurdles and the continued success of Marion Jones in the women's 200. Jones won in 21.94 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year, struggling in the final meters but finishing ahead of the world champion, Inger Miller (22.09), and Nanceen Perry (22.38).</p>

        <p>The women's 800 meters produced a rare family affair today at the United States Olympic trials as Hazel Clark finished first in 1 minute 58.97 seconds, her sister-in-law Jearl Miles-Clark took second in 1:59.12 and her half-sister Joetta Clark-Diggs slipped into third by a hundredth of a second in 1:59.49.</p>
        <p>This apparently unprecedented family achievement overshadowed a world record of 15 feet 2 1/4 inches by Stacy Dragila in the women's pole vault, an American record of 12.33 seconds by Gail Devers in the 100 hurdles and the continued success of Marion Jones in the women's 200. Jones won in 21.94 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year, struggling in the final meters but finishing ahead of the world champion, Inger Miller (22.09), and Nanceen Perry (22.38).</p>
        <p>All three members of the Clark family are coached by J. J. Clark, Miles-Clark's husband and the brother of Hazel and Joetta. The family is from Maplewood, N.J., although Clark and Miles-Clark now train in Gainesville, Fla. Clark-Diggs flies down from New Jersey two weeks a month to train with the group. The family patriarch is Joe Clark, the hard-nosed former high school principal depicted in the movie ''Lean on Me.''</p>
        <p>Hazel Clark, 22, a former figure skater, took a slight lead on the inside at 400 meters in 58.93. Miles-Clark, 33, a three-time United States outdoor champion at 400 meters and a two-time champion at 800 meters, moved in front down the backstretch and held the margin through 600 meters in 1:29.2. She remained ahead down the homestretch, but began tightening up and Clark passed her in the final meters.</p>
        <p>Clark-Diggs, meanwhile, hung near the rear for 500 meters then surged to make her fourth Olympic team at age 37, dipping inside of Meredith Rainey-Valmon with her final stride. Overcome by her exertion, Miles-Clark was carried off the track into a trainers area.</p>
        <p>''I'm so happy that my mom was able to see this race,'' Hazel Clark said. ''She had a stroke several weeks ago and is fully recovered right now. It made me so happy to see my mom with tears in her eyes after I won. It was nice to room with my sister for this race. We had a lot of fun looking at movies. My sister and I are very close. I just had to go out and run my race. I dreamed every night about making the Olympic team.''</p>
        <p>Clark-Diggs, the director of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, is retiring after this season, but she has one more important race to run, in the Olympics.</p>
        <p>''I was not sure I was going to make the team, but I knew I had to dig down deep,'' she said. ''There was a lot of pressure, but when I crossed the finish line I was relieved. My family is very close, and as Hazel got older in age, I knew she would be a tough competitor.''</p>
        <p>Miles-Clark said: ''I was O.K. until the last 20 meters. I began to tie up at that point. Today, Hazel was the better athlete.''</p>
        <p>Dragila set the only world record at the trials. The women's pole vault will be contested for the first time at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. Dragila, whose previous record was 15-1 3/4, will now be the clear favorite for a gold medal. She has actually jumped higher, clearing 15-5 at a beach competition earlier this season, but the mark was not ratified for a world record because the runway did not meet specifications.</p>
        <p>Dragila, who trains in Pocatello, Idaho, attempted 15-5 today and nearly cleared it on her second attempt, as the bar wobbled and appeared to stay in place before falling into the pit. Fearing that she would not clear a height before the competition began, she had practiced visualization and relaxation techniques, lying alone in a dark room, imagining the perfect vault and standing on the podium with a gold medal around her neck. Today, things happened just as she imagined they would.</p>
        <p>Jones is visualizing five gold medals in Sydney, and she has now not lost a footrace in three years. She got a brilliant start today and led comfortably off the curve. Miller made a charge from Lane 7 and closed within a stride but could not overtake Jones, who perhaps was fatigued after dominating the 100 (10.88) and the long jump (23- 1/2) last weekend.</p>
        <p>Her results in the trials were encouraging. At the 1999 world championships in Seville, Spain, Jones withdrew with back spasms during the semifinals of the 200. Miller won in 21.77, faster than Jones had run all season. Jones won today but was not dominant, leaving a bit of intrigue for the Olympics in September.</p>
        <p>Jones's primary concern heading toward Sydney is refining her long-jumping, which has been improving but erratic. The American women will be favored in the 400-meter relay, but the 1,600 relay could be problematic. Russia and Germany have beaten the Americans in recent years, and since running 49.59 seconds at the Mount Sac Relays in May, Jones has not been training specifically for the 400. After winning the 100 and 200 at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, Florence Griffith Joyner took the baton for the anchor leg of the 1,600-meter relay three strides behind a Russian quarter-miler and made up two strides, but she could never pull ahead.</p>
        <p>In the men's 800 tonight, Mark Everett made his fourth Olympic team, winning in 1:45.67.</p>
        <p>Devers, the two-time Olympic champion at 100 meters and the three-time world champion in the hurdles, has been slowed by repeated injuries since the Atlanta Olympics. Today, however, she shattered her own American record of 12.37 seconds.</p>
        <p>In the men's 110 hurdles, the Olympic champion Allen Johnson won in 12.97, the fastest time in the world this year.</p>
        <p>Charles Austin, the defending Olympic champion in the high jump, won the trials today at 7-7 1/4, ahead of Kenny Evans and Nathan Leeper, who both jumped 7-5 1/4.</p>
