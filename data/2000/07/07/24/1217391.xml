        <p>Herbert Williams is 75 years old, and no one would blame him if he stayed home and took it easy. But with the broiling heat pushing the thermometer to 104 degrees, Mr. Williams stood in his blue overalls and joined in a project that has become a matter of survival for this dusty little town: shoveling dirt.</p>
        <p>Almost every corner of Texas knows the grip of drought this year. But here, more than anywhere else, that grip is a choke hold. In about 50 days, maybe 60, officials say, the lake that provides water for the 1,063 residents here will go dry, unless there is a miraculous turn in the weather.</p>
        <p>There is no other water, no backup system and no sign of rain.</p>
        <p>So this week the town began a variation of an old-time barn raising: volunteers are working to dig about 20 miles of underground pipeline to connect with a water system in the nearby town of Elbert before time, and water, run out.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing,'' said Steve Bowlin, head of Throckmorton's Public Works Department, taking some shade beneath an oak tree as crews worked nearby. ''It tells me that there are still a lot of fine people out there.''</p>
        <p>In a state made rich and famous by oil, there is no more precious natural resource today than water. Reservoirs are at their third lowest capacity in 23 years. Small cities like Abilene and San Angelo and metropolitan areas like San Antonio are under water conservation plans. The state usually suffers one drought every decade, but this is the third in four years.</p>
        <p>''One word, dry,'' said Leonard Olson, the spokesman for the Texas Water Development Board, noting that it had not rained in Austin, the capital, in 31 days. ''I think Throckmorton is probably the worst case that we know of,'' because of the lack of alternate water supplies.</p>
        <p>Isolated in the rugged ranch country of northwest Texas, about three hours west of Dallas, Throckmorton was once the last stop on the railroad, a place still called the ''capital of cow country'' because of the surrounding cattle ranches. For years, the town has drawn water from the lake bearing its name, but without any underground aquifers, it has no other source.</p>
        <p>''When I moved down here, it was raining all the time,'' said Mr. Bowlin, 39, who came three years ago. ''I made the comment to my wife that I thought my feet were going to go webbed. But it hasn't rained since.''</p>
        <p>It has rained occasionally in Throckmorton, but little that has fallen has accumulated in the lake.</p>
        <p>By last fall, Mr. Bowlin and Mayor John Kunkel realized that another water source would be needed to prevent an emergency. But the town had floated bonds in the 1980's to build its pumping system and could not afford the money for a new pipeline. So it went looking for money, and received a $200,000 federal grant. It also received a state grant in June, and Gov. George W. Bush declared the town a disaster area. The state grant included $800,000 for materials but required that Throckmorton provide the labor.</p>
        <p>With only 11 full-time and part-time municipal employees, the town needed help. So Mr. Bowlin and Mr. Kunkel began spreading the word to surrounding communities that volunteers were needed. The story made the news. On Monday, the first planned day of digging, no one knew if anyone would show up.</p>
        <p>They did. ''Anybody who is anybody is working on this project,'' said Charles Fischer, the pastor of the town's First Baptist Church, who worked on the pipeline all week before breaking to prepare for a wedding and his Sunday sermon.</p>
        <p>More than 100 people were waiting on Monday, and have been coming back since. They include most of the town's available, able-bodied residents; those unable to work sent donations or, like a Baptist men's group, helped nourish the diggers.</p>
        <p>A chain gang of inmates did not have a choice about digging. But a group of enlistees from the nearby Air Force base did, and they reported for work along with a group of volunteers from the Navy. A chaplain on a motorcycle rumbled in from east Texas. Others came from Amarillo and beyond, and Mr. Williams arrived from the town of Rule, about 45 miles away.</p>
        <p>''I just came over here to help our neighbors,'' Mr. Williams said.</p>
        <p>A television station in Abilene led a drive for bottled water, and nearly three truckloads of water arrived from San Antonio, courtesy of a grocery chain. Construction companies have donated backhoes and ditch-digging machines. Surrounding towns like Seymour have loaned city equipment and workers. The local fire whistle is sounded every time a truck arrives with shipments of suntan lotion, caps or bottled water.</p>
        <p>''Everyone's listening for the fire whistle to go off, because that means we need to go unload a truck,'' said Angela Oliver, who hands out cold drinks and wet rags to workers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowlin, the public works director, is cautiously optimistic. Five miles of trench have been dug, and he was expecting fast progress because of the ditch-digging equipment. He hopes more volunteers arrive to help shovel sand into the trench after the pipe is connected. He thinks the line can be completed in less than a month.</p>
        <p>His main worry is whether two pumping stations can be finished in time. If not, he said an emergency plan calls for trucking in water.</p>
        <p>There is still hope, however bleak, for a downpour. Every Tuesday, people gather outside the county courthouse to pray for rain. Two letters have arrived at City Hall with instructions on how to properly pray for rain. Another letter, published in The Throckmorton Tribune, suggested killing a snake and laying it over a fence at dusk as one way of provoking the skies. Other people are watching for turtles and tarantulas crossing the road to high ground, a sure sign of rain in these parts.</p>
        <p>But for now, people are digging. Cots are set up in the church assembly halls for volunteers, and other out-of-towners are staying with residents. The hospital has donated wet rags for people working in the oppressive heat. A Red Cross disaster relief truck drives along the work site, and a voice over the intercom announces, ''Watermelon slices! Orange slices!''</p>
        <p>One worker, Lester Sullivan, 31, drove a few hundred miles east from Amarillo when he heard about Throckmorton. An out-of-work truck driver in sandals, Mr. Sullivan was shoveling sand into the trench to make a bed for the pipeline. He was relieved when Ms. Oliver arrived with a Gatorade.</p>
        <p>Why drive several hours just to shovel sand for strangers?</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan smiled and said he planned to stay until the job was done. ''One of these day I might need some help,'' he said, ''and I figure somebody from here might come to help out.''</p>
