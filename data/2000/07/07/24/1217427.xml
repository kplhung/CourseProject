        <p>IN the soccer corner of his heart, Melvin Mora  is a 9  the field number for an aggressive forward who scores goals. That's what he was back in Venezuela, a soccer professional at 14.</p>
        <p>He was even investigating playing American soccer a few years ago, possibly giving up baseball before it broke him.</p>
        <p>Ask him about his best baseball position, Mora smiles and asks, ''You want the truth?'' In the baseball corner of his heart, Mora is an 8, the defensive designation for a center fielder, which he relishes because ''I like the control.'' His second best position, he volunteers, is second base, a 4.</p>
        <p>For the moment, however, and maybe for this entire tantalizing season of brinksmanship, Melvin Mora is quite likely to be a 6. He learned yesterday that he is still the Mets' interim shortstop, after Barry Larkin artfully finagled the Mets' modest offer into a three-year extension by the Reds.</p>
        <p>Mora played shortstop last night as the Mets lost to the Braves, 1-0. The Mets could do far worse. This is a man who has literally been kicked off the team bus, a metaphor for his life in baseball, yet he brings a gracious demeanor and an air of confidence. How confident? When he joined the Mets last September, he told Cookie Rojas, the third-base coach, not to worry: ''I've been in baseball 10 years and made the playoffs nine times.'' Soon afterward it was 10 for 11.</p>
        <p>How confident? After losing the first three games of the division series, the Mets were down a run in the eighth inning, with Mora on first and Roger Cedeno on second. While the Braves brought in a knucklehead left-hander named John Rocker, Mora reminded Cedeno that Rocker was sloppy about holding runners on base. It took two pitches for Mora to dare Cedeno into the successful double steal that set up John Olerud's two-run single that kept the Mets alive.</p>
        <p>How confident? Mora said he feels no pressure in the major leagues, not after playing for Magallanes against Caracas in Venezuelan winter ball, which he calls ''hora chiquita'' -- crunch time.</p>
        <p>That is confidence. In Mora's first sport, you make something from nothing, creating a goal from a broken play, a mistake, a counterattack. In his second sport, he has been doing exactly that, resurrecting a career, coming back from Taiwan, of all places, to win a job, however tenuous.</p>
        <p>Hardly a regular, surely not a star, Mora gives zest to one of the most appealing Mets teams since Mookie Wilson and Hubie Brooks were coming along in the early 80's.</p>
        <p>He has been filling in most of the time since Rey Ordonez went down with a broken forearm. The club may have been second-guessing committing $16 million for the next three years to a glittery shortstop who cannot even bunt in an age of graceful brutes like Jeter, Garciaparra and, dare one whisper the name, Rodriguez.</p>
        <p>Barry Larkin would have been a major addition, and Mora would have welcomed him, not having the status to pout. He gave up pro soccer at 19, playing in the Houston system for six years without ever getting to the varsity spring training.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'All right, I'll go somewhere else,' '' which turned out to be Taiwan.</p>
        <p>''They handed me $60,000 in cash,'' Mora recalled last evening. ''I never saw so much money in my life. But when I got there, it was rough. They promised me an apartment, but when I got there they put me in a room with other players. There was my bed, right next to the bathroom. Bed. Bathroom. That's it.''</p>
        <p>Mora stayed six weeks, hit well, which made it dangerous for him.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of gambling in Taiwan,'' he said. ''They go after the good hitters who do not strike out a lot. They say they can kill you if you don't agree. I had to get out.''</p>
        <p>The club held his passport, but he finally got back to Florida, where he was courted by the Mets' assistant general manager, Jim Duquette, after the intervention of Edgar Alfonzo, a fellow Venezuelan. Alfonzo is a coach in the Mets' system and the brother of the Mets' Edgardo.</p>
        <p>Mora had a great spring training with the Mets in 1999, and was about to get on the bus when the team broke camp, when he was told he was being left behind.</p>
        <p>''Bobby Valentine was honest with me,'' Mora said last night. ''He told me I did everything they asked, but I had options. I thanked them for putting me in play, but when I got back to the hotel room, I cried. I knew people would ask Edgardo: 'Hey, where's Mora? Where's the little guy?' ''</p>
        <p>Some players who are cut at the end of spring training sink like a stone. Melvin Mora did not. When he came back, he was the Mets' secret weapon, suddenly turned loose, running and hitting and fielding several positions, just as he had in spring training.</p>
        <p>Now, with his alliterative name, sweet smile, positive demeanor and versatile skills, he has the makings of a folk hero in Queens. There is no official baseball number for that.</p>
