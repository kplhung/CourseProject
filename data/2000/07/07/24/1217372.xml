        <p>Meredith Monk has spoken often of her desire to awaken audiences to a sense of wonder in life. Her work is eclectic and impossible to categorize. She is at once a composer, singer, choreographer, creator of theater works, filmmaker and high priestess of enchantment. But in every piece she invites you to bypass the part of your brain that craves logic and understanding and to respond intuitively to the wondrous qualities of her strange, sometimes tender and often downright silly sounds and images.</p>
        <p>A nearly full house at Alice Tully Hall on Friday night was willing to do just that as Ms. Monk offered the second of three programs in a retrospective of her work called ''Voice Travel,'' presented by Lincoln Center Festival 2000. Young people were among her most enthusiastic followers when Ms. Monk emerged as a leader of the New York downtown avant-garde movement in the 1970's, and today, at 56, she still has powerful appeal for the young, judging from this audience.</p>

        <p>Meredith Monk has spoken often of her desire to awaken audiences to a sense of wonder in life. Her work is eclectic and impossible to categorize. She is at once a composer, singer, choreographer, creator of theater works, filmmaker and high priestess of enchantment. But in every piece she invites you to bypass the part of your brain that craves logic and understanding and to respond intuitively to the wondrous qualities of her strange, sometimes tender and often downright silly sounds and images.</p>
        <p>A nearly full house at Alice Tully Hall on Friday night was willing to do just that as Ms. Monk offered the second of three programs in a retrospective of her work called ''Voice Travel,'' presented by Lincoln Center Festival 2000. Young people were among her most enthusiastic followers when Ms. Monk emerged as a leader of the New York downtown avant-garde movement in the 1970's, and today, at 56, she still has powerful appeal for the young, judging from this audience.</p>
        <p>To this listener her most successful works, those which best enable you to follow her into the realm of the wondrous, are the simplest, like ''Porch,'' from 1969, a solo song with which she began the program. In comparison with operatically trained singers, Ms. Monk has just a slip of a voice. Hers is an artistry that relies on sensitive amplification. But she can do amazing things with what she calls ''extended vocal techniques,'' and in ''Porch'' she does them all.</p>
        <p>Her sounds range from deep-set bogeyman chest tones to chirping falsetto high notes. She can bend notes and inflect a phrase with the raspy poignancy of a great blues singer like Mississippi John Hurt. And like a Tibetan Buddhist chanter, she can sustain a steady low tone while shaping a floating counter melody in soft, eerie high harmonics. Movements -- bobbing, weaving, arm gestures, leg lifts -- are as much a part of the music as sound.</p>
        <p>A member of her vocal ensemble, Theo Bleckmann, joined her for three short, fanciful songs from ''Facing North'' (1990). Here the two singers literally faced off, trading pitches and singing in parallel intervals, sometimes sputtering syllables like slapstick comics. This is music that celebrates acting ridiculous, that turns slapping your knees and singing ''Hey, hey, ha, ha, ho, ho'' into contemporary art.</p>
        <p>Of course when the part of the brain that craves logic is bypassed for too long it starts to grow restive. That was the problem listening to the long second section from Ms. Monk's three-part 1991 opera, ''Atlas,'' performed here by her 13-voice ensemble and an 11-player instrumental group conducted by Wayne Hankin. The text of the opera is mostly a made-up language of nonsense. But occasional lines in English sketch a story of a restless young woman who leaves home, auditions traveling companions and has adventures, some of them scary, some of them cosmic.</p>
        <p>The vocal writing is often complex and intriguing, with astringently dissonant sustained harmonies and busy contrapuntal writing. She is much less strong writing for instruments, which mostly are used here to create long, repetitive patterns, melodic drones and rhythmic riffs in irregular meters. Part Three of ''Atlas,'' performed in the second half, was more interesting. At its best the opera is like some archetypal work of folklore from a country of Ms. Monk's imagination. At its worst it seems padded and dull.</p>
        <p>But it is missing the point, her champions would argue, to overanalyze her works. They are not musical compositions but disarming spiritual experiences, though only for those willing to leave their questioning selves in the lobby.</p>
