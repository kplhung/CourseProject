        <p>IN golf, a handicap is the great equalizer. It enables anybody to play against anybody else, even Tiger Woods, on theoretically even terms. If you have a 15 handicap and shoot 87, your net score would be 72, which is even par at most courses. But that's only if you're an amateur.</p>
        <p>If you're a pro, you compete without a handicap, or belly to belly, as Ben Hogan once told a young pro. In golf, a pro is a pro is a pro.</p>

        <p>IN golf, a handicap is the great equalizer. It enables anybody to play against anybody else, even Tiger Woods, on theoretically even terms. If you have a 15 handicap and shoot 87, your net score would be 72, which is even par at most courses. But that's only if you're an amateur.</p>
        <p>If you're a pro, you compete without a handicap, or belly to belly, as Ben Hogan once told a young pro. In golf, a pro is a pro is a pro.</p>
        <p>But as Tiger Woods keeps proving, all pros are not created equal and maybe it's time to establish the Tiger Handicap Equalizer system, by which the other pros would get a few strokes from him, at least in the four major tournaments.</p>
        <p>When Woods walked off the 18th green of the hallowed Old Course in the Royal Burgh of St. Andrews yesterday, he had won the 129th British Open by eight strokes. He won last month's United States Open at Pebble Beach by a record 15 strokes.</p>
        <p>With the 1997 Masters and last year's Professional Golfers Association Championship already stashed away, he joined Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Gene Sarazen as the only golfers with a career Grand Slam of the four majors.</p>
        <p>And at 24, Woods is the youngest to do it; Nicklaus was 26 when he completed his slam by winning the British Open at Muirfield in 1966.</p>
        <p>Woods also joined Bobby Jones, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Hogan and Sarazen as the only golfers to have won both Opens in the same year.</p>
        <p>For him to be in such fancy company at such a young age is all the more reason to establish the Tiger Handicap Equalizer system in the majors. Give the other top 50 pros in the world four strokes over 72 holes, the next 50 six strokes and the others eight strokes.</p>
        <p>That formula would still not have been enough for anybody else to win (or even force a playoff) in the British Open or the United States Open, but at least it would provide the other pros with some hope -- an element that Woods has seemed to have all but destroyed in other pros.</p>
        <p>Before this British Open began, the Scots warned that the bunkers, of which the Old Course has 112, lurked for Woods. But he was never in a bunker in four rounds.</p>
        <p>''Bunker,'' he said when told that some thought he had been in a bunker on the seventh hole on Friday. ''I was in a bunker every day -- on the practice range.''</p>
        <p>But as dazzling as Woods's talent and work ethic on the range are, he is believed to be the first golfer to prepare so studiously for tournaments, especially the majors. Before this British Open, he studied videotapes of previous British Opens and Dunhill Cup matches at the Old Course going back to the 1960's.</p>
        <p>When Woods had an afternoon tee time here, as he did Friday, Saturday and yesterday, he spent the morning watching the BBC telecast in his suite in the Old Course Hotel overlooking the 17th hole.</p>
        <p>''It gives you an understanding of how the golf course is playing,'' he said. ''How the fairways are receiving the shots, how the greens are receiving the shots, what spin you need to come in with -- overspin, backspin. Some of the pin locations are a little different than we're used to seeing, so it's neat to take a look at the shots and how the green is receiving them.''</p>
        <p>Before arriving here, Woods viewed St. Andrews videotapes at the Golf Channel studios in Orlando, Fla., and in his villa in the nearby gated Isleworth area, with the emphasis on worth. He also owns two Isleworth lots where he plans to build a more spacious home.</p>
        <p>''He wants to build that home with prize money that he's earned on the golf course -- not with any of the money from any of his sponsors or endorsement contracts,'' said Bev Norwood, one of his International Management Group business advisers. ''It's important to him to build that home with prize money that he's earned.''</p>
        <p>Woods could start building that home any time. He has already earned about $20 million worldwide in less than four years as a pro.</p>
        <p>In winning the British Open at St. Andrews, Woods also joined the other Americans to have won it here, going back to Jones in 1927, Denny Shute in 1933, Sam Snead in 1946, Tony Lema in 1964, Nicklaus in 1970 and 1978 and John Daly in 1995. When Snead, at 88 the oldest living British Open winner, was here early last week for a reunion of past champions, he remembered playing two holes with a little boy named Tiger Woods, who also remembered it in detail.</p>
        <p>''I was 5 or 6, we played at Calabasas Country Club,'' recalled Woods, who grew up in Cypress, Calif. ''He was playing an exhibition where he had a new group of playing partners every two holes. I got a chance to play with him the last two.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't carry this little par 3 with a creek in front. I was trying to bounce it on the cart path and through the creek. I missed it. My dad says I missed by a few yards to the right. It rolled into the creek, a rocky creek. I got in there to play it. The ball was sitting up. From behind me, Sam yells, 'What are you doing?'</p>
        <p>''I look around, look dumbfounded. I'm going to hit the shot. He says: 'Just pick it up and drop it. Let's go on.' I didn't like that very much. I remember looking at my ball and saying: 'I've got to hit it. I don't want to drop. That's a penalty.' So I hit a 7-iron out onto the green, all wet, two-putted, got my bogey and bogeyed the last.</p>
        <p>''I made bogey, bogey and Sam beat me by two -- par, par.''</p>
        <p>But that was when Tiger Woods needed to have a handicap. Now all the other pros do.</p>
