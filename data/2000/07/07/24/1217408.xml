        <p>As the Liberty clawed closer to the only championship team in the history of the Women's National Basketball Association, pouncing on loose balls, burying 3-pointers and slowly suffocating the Houston Comets in the final 15 minutes yesterday afternoon, the tension inside Madison Square Garden increased with the decibel level.</p>
        <p>On the sideline, Houston Coach Van Chancellor could not hear himself yelling at his players to play defense -- nor could they. Liberty center Tari Phillips could feel the crowd's energy crescendo, but she was more overcome by the tension from two cramps that gripped her left leg like a vise. Something had to burst.</p>

        <p>As the Liberty clawed closer to the only championship team in the history of the Women's National Basketball Association, pouncing on loose balls, burying 3-pointers and slowly suffocating the Houston Comets in the final 15 minutes yesterday afternoon, the tension inside Madison Square Garden increased with the decibel level.</p>
        <p>On the sideline, Houston Coach Van Chancellor could not hear himself yelling at his players to play defense -- nor could they. Liberty center Tari Phillips could feel the crowd's energy crescendo, but she was more overcome by the tension from two cramps that gripped her left leg like a vise. Something had to burst.</p>
        <p>With 4 minutes 8 seconds to play, Phillips took a pass from Teresa Weatherspoon on the perimeter and sank a 17-footer. The 19,563 fans roared. Her pain faded. She had pushed the Liberty past the Comets for only the second time in the game, this time for a 59-58 lead, the culmination of an 11-point second-half comeback.</p>
        <p>The Liberty never trailed again, outlasting Houston for an emotional 69-64 victory against the team that twice beat the Liberty for the W.N.B.A. championship.</p>
        <p>''When we persevered, that was the jubilant part for me,'' Phillips said, grinning after the game.</p>
        <p>A 6-foot-3-inch center, Phillips was traded from Portland to the Liberty right before its first game of the season, against the Comets. She did not play in that loss. Since then, she has been selected for the All-Star team and has led the team in scoring. Yesterday she totaled 17 points, 7 in the final 10 minutes, and pulled down 11 rebounds.</p>
        <p>She was not the only clutch performer. Guard Becky Hammon, who was undrafted last year and fought through training camp to become a starter this year, also scored 17 points, 12 on 3-pointers.</p>
        <p>Hammon understood the significance of winning the showdown with the Comets (21-4): the victory tied the head-to-head series at 7-7, and Houston does not lose often. The Liberty is the only team against which Houston does not hold a winning record.</p>
        <p>''Everybody wants to play their best games against Houston,'' Hammon said, noting that it has been the dominant franchise in the league. ''And everybody loves to hate New York, so people play their best games against us, too.''</p>
        <p>Although the Liberty won its seventh of eight games and improved to 14-10, the players were careful to leave their euphoria in the locker room before flying to Washington for today's game against the Mystics (11-12), their Eastern Conference foes. ''We needed this,'' Coach Richie Adubato said. ''Any time you beat the premier team of the league, I'm happy. It's like when you beat the Chicago Bulls, you always lost the next game. Because it takes such an effort to beat them, you have to quiet the energy to come back and do it again.''</p>
        <p>Adubato praised Phillips's effort, and with five minutes left in the game, he pretended not to see her limping and appealing for a rest. ''I wasn't looking,'' he said. ''That was no time to come out.''</p>
        <p>Especially after what she and her teammates had accomplished. They trailed by as many as 12 points in the first half, having allowed the threesome of Sheryl Swoopes, Cynthia Cooper and Tina Thompson to penetrate and point guard Janeth Arcain to quietly score 12 first-half points.</p>
        <p>''For the last six games, we have been playing aggressive defense,'' Vickie Johnson said. ''We just needed to bring up the intensity in the second half and make some shots.''</p>
        <p>Johnson, Hammon and Sue Wicks did just that to spark the comeback. Wicks had three huge baskets, including an off-balance runner and a 15-footer that put the Liberty within a point at 51-50 at the 8:58 mark. Then Johnson gave the Liberty its first lead of the game, at 7:25, when she muscled in a put-back.</p>
        <p>While Swoopes was keeping the game close -- she led all scorers with 18 points -- Weatherspoon had two timely steals and Phillips scored at 4:35 to tie it, 57-57, setting up the tie-breaking basket. She added another jumper from 15 feet to give the Liberty a 5-point lead with 2:20 remaining. Johnson hit a fadeaway baseline jumper with one minute remaining, and with only two seconds left on the shot clock, to secure the victory.</p>
        <p>''This is a tough place to play, and when they got physical it changed the whole game,'' Chancellor said. ''They put defense on us in the second half and played well. I tell you, the trade for Phillips made New York the team to beat in the East.''</p>
        <p>The Cleveland Rockers, the Orlando Miracle and the Liberty are in a virtual tie for first place in the East. ''This was not so much about beating Houston,'' Johnson said, ''but is about taking a step toward winning the East and a championship.''</p>
