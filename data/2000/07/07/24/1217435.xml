        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your comments about the need for the New York City Board of Education to raise teacher salaries to levels competitive with surrounding suburban districts (editorial, July 19) cut to the heart of the problem facing public education in the United States.</p>
        <p>While passion for children is an important reason that many people choose to become teachers, it is unrealistic to rely on altruism to address this crisis. In truth, the more we pay teachers, the higher quality teachers we will have and the better educated our children will become.</p>

        <p>Your comments about the need for the New York City Board of Education to raise teacher salaries to levels competitive with surrounding suburban districts (editorial, July 19) cut to the heart of the problem facing public education in the United States.</p>
        <p>While passion for children is an important reason that many people choose to become teachers, it is unrealistic to rely on altruism to address this crisis. In truth, the more we pay teachers, the higher quality teachers we will have and the better educated our children will become.</p>
        <p>The presidential candidates claim to put education at the forefront, but why hasn't either proposed a federal tax exemption for public school teachers? Until the public makes a commitment to increasing teacher compensation, our education system will continue to be populated by people with mediocre talents.</p>
