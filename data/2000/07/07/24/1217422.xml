        <p>Marian Swerdlow and her fellow social studies teachers at Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School in Brooklyn braced for the worst last month when their students took the new Regents exam in global history and geography.</p>
        <p>After all, New York State has sharply raised academic standards in recent years, requiring all students to pass its rigorous Regents exams to graduate. The tests, once reserved for the state's most ambitious students, are being revamped to match the new standards, and many teachers have feared the failure rates would soar.</p>
        <p>They have not. Instead, teachers are complaining that the new exams are so easy -- and the scoring system so lenient -- that even their worst students pass easily.</p>
        <p>An astonishing 96 percent of this year's high school seniors had passed the English Regents as of January, including thousands who took the revised version. While the state has not released data on the new global history exam, teachers at about a dozen New York City high schools said in interviews that most of their students had passed on their first try.</p>
        <p>''You would have to be comatose to fail this new test,'' said Ms. Swerdlow, who said that 80 percent of Roosevelt students who took the new global history exam last month passed. ''Students who did no work all semester, who failed tests all year, passed this exam handily.''</p>
        <p>Teachers are equally skeptical of the new English Regents exam, which was introduced in June 1999. The exam -- the only one that students were required to pass for a diploma this year -- was expanded to six hours, from three. It includes longer passages to test reading comprehension and requires more essays, including one based on a spoken passage. Anne Rawley, an English teacher at the High School for Leadership and Public Service in Manhattan, said the test was hard enough. But under the state's scoring system, teachers had to assign passing grades to essays they considered ''terrible,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''The state is legitimizing illiteracy,'' said Ms. Rawley, who said that 91 percent of the students who took the English Regents at her school last month passed. ''A lot of these kids are writing essays that are barely comprehensible, yet we're telling them that they're totally competent. They're going to get out into the real world and crash.''</p>
        <p>Roseanne DeFabio, an assistant state education commissioner for testing, said that if the average scores on the essay questions turned out to be surprisingly high, the state would reconsider its scoring system. But she said the system had been devised with extensive teacher input, after field testing of the new exam.</p>
        <p>''Let's wait and see how many people actually breezed through,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The new global history exam -- which students will not be required to pass until 2002 -- includes 50 multiple-choice questions, which Ms. Swerdlow and other teachers said were similar in content to the old global history Regents. But the revised exam also asks students to read short excerpts from different texts and answer questions about them. Teachers say that students only have to paraphrase the excerpts to get credit for these questions, which are worth a total of 11 points.</p>
        <p>Students also have to write two essays, including one that uses ''evidence'' from the excerpts. Many teachers have complained that the test spoon-feeds students the information they need to write the essay, instead of testing what they learned during the school year. The old Regents exam in global history required students to use more of their own knowledge, the teachers say.</p>
        <p>Even more problematic, the teachers say, is the system for scoring the essays. Teachers score them on a scale of 0 to 5. Many said that while it was hard to earn a 5, students could still write essays that were poorly organized, incomplete or inaccurate and still get a 2 or a 3.</p>
        <p>According to the scoring chart for the global history exam, students can pass if they receive 32 out of 61 points on the multiple-choice and short-answer questions, and 4 out of 10 points on the two essays. It is even possible to pass without receiving any credit for the essays, although the student would have to do extremely well on the multiple-choice and short-answer questions.</p>
        <p>''I marked countless exams where students left out either one or both essays, recopied the quotations or wrote virtually illiterate essays, and still passed the exam,'' said Martin Stark, a social studies teacher at Francis Lewis High School in Queens. About 15 of the roughly 50 students in Mr. Stark's two global history classes failed the course, he said. But only three failed the Regents test.</p>
        <p>Ms. DeFabio and Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, insisted in interviews that the new exam was at least as challenging as the old one. In keeping with the new standards, they say, it tests not only factual knowledge, but also the ability to analyze information and use it to write a well-organized essay.</p>
        <p>''We've never had history tests in the past that required students to write full essays,'' Ms. DeFabio said. ''What we're aiming for now is for them to synthesize information and produce a well-constructed essay, establishing a point of view and supporting it.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''We think that's quite a raising of expectations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills said that if most students were passing the revised Regents exams, it was only because they were working harder. But New York's results contrast sharply with testing data from some other states that have raised standards. Failure rates are rising in some states, including Massachusetts and Virginia, and several have eased their graduation requirements in the face of political and parental pressure.</p>
        <p>In New York State, where Mr. Mills has pushed unremittingly for higher standards, the stakes are high. Critics predicted that dropout rates would sharply increase if all students, including those in special education and those with limited English skills, had to take the Regents exams. Schools, too, have much to lose: Mr. Mills recently announced that they would be publicly graded -- and rewarded or punished -- according to their test scores.</p>
        <p>New York lowered the passing grade on Regents exams to 55 out of 100, from 65, for the first few years that the revised tests are given. Ms. DeFabio warned that the failure rate could rise significantly once the passing grade is raised to 65, starting in 2004. She also said that students were taking longer to finish the new exams -- a sign that they were more challenging -- and that both exams had been field-tested on several thousand students around the state.</p>
        <p>''As we move along and students get better at the skills being tested, we can use more sophisticated material,'' Ms. DeFabio said, ''and ask more probing questions that require more rigorous analysis.''</p>
        <p>Ms. DeFabio defended the state's decision to focus less on testing factual knowledge, and more on what she called ''higher-level thinking skills.''</p>
        <p>''You want to know not just whether they've memorized facts,'' she said, ''but whether they can read information from a variety of sources, understand the differences in perspective and then do their own analysis.''</p>
        <p>That is all very well, teachers say, but the real problem is the state's system for grading the essays.</p>
        <p>For an essay in the global history exam about human rights violations, for example, the scoring key directed teachers to give a 2 to an essay that ''provides a weak definition of the term 'human rights,' '' and ''is a poorly organized essay, lacking focus.'' For another essay, students were asked to describe how capitalism and communism ''attempt to meet the needs of the people,'' and to evaluate how successful each system has been. But a student could earn a 3 by merely repeating quotations about the two systems given in a previous section of the test.</p>
        <p>''The only way you could wipe out on the essays was if you left the pages blank,'' said Ms. Swerdlow, the social studies teacher at Roosevelt High School in Brooklyn. ''I was giving 3's to essays that I considered to have a significant number of inaccuracies, because that's what the scoring rubric told us to do.''</p>
        <p>Students who score a 3 on both essays and get all of the short-answer questions right need to get only 15 of a possible 50 points on the multiple-choice questions to pass.</p>
        <p>Ms. Swerdlow and other teachers said the lenient scoring on the new exams would allow teachers and students to be less diligent. Meryl Tisch, a member of the State Board of Regents, said teachers complaining about the new tests might have unrealistic expectations. She pointed out that the state permitted schools to substitute other tests, such as the Advanced Placement exams, if they considered the Regents too easy.</p>
        <p>But Robert B. Schwartz, president of Achieve, a group monitoring the standards movement, said he would not be surprised if New York and other states decided their new tests and scoring systems needed work.</p>
        <p>''Every state that does this needs to make some educated guesses about where to set the bar, and it's possible that New York has initially set it too low,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''People are going to have to take the view that we will need to make mid-course corrections in almost every aspect of this work.''</p>
        <p>A CLOSER LOOK: New Regents Exams: Harder to Fail?</p>
        <p>Teachers say New York State's scoring system for the new Regents exams is too lenient because it allows students to pass even if they do extremely poorly on the essay sections. The student whose essay on the global history and geography exam is printed below, for example, received no credit for it, but still managed to pass the test with a 57. Instead of following the instructions, the student wrote lyrics from a punk rock song.</p>
        <p>The Question</p>
        <p>''Throughout history, the human rights of certain groups of people have been violated. Efforts have been made to address these violations. Define the term 'human rights.' Identify two examples of human rights violations that have occurred in a specific time and place. Describe the causes of these human rights violations. For one of the violations identified, discuss one specific effort that was made or is being made to deal with the violation.''</p>
        <p>The Answer  Perfect Government</p>
        <p>Even if it's easy to be free, what's your definition of freedom? And who the [expletive] are you, anyway, who the [expletive] are they, who the [expletive] am I to say, what the [expletive] is really going on? How did the cat get so fat? Why do the families die? Do you care why? Because there hasn't been a sign of anything getting better in the ghetto, people are fed up, but when they get up you point your little finger, you racist, you bigot, but that's not your problem now, is it? You love to watch the war from the White House, and I wonder -- how can they sleep at night?</p>
        <p>U$A  Amerikkka</p>
        <p>Baby, they would sooner plate your chains with gold, encrust your shackles with diamonds, and drape your cage with a velvet curtain before they could tell you that you are free with a straight face.</p>
