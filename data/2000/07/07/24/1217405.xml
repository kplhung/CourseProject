        <p>Not long after W. Lee Nutter took over last year as chairman of Rayonier Inc., a big wood and pulp company with headquarters in Stamford, Conn., he called in a top executive, Jack O'Grady, and asked, ''Why are we here?''</p>
        <p>The reasons, in fact, had peeled away. Modern technology now allowed the company to distance itself from New York's financial markets and still have complete instant communications. More of Rayonier's timberland and mills were in the Southeast, and Jacksonville beckoned with $2.7 million in public subsidies. And, in a booming economy, managers and executives were increasingly expensive. Moving to an office tower here this summer cut executive labor costs.</p>
        <p>Twenty-eight people transferred from Stamford, but others declined to relocate and 44 men and women, mostly executives, are being hired locally at salaries that are at least 10 percent lower, on average, than those paid in Stamford. In relocating, Rayonier shrank the headquarters staff to 72 from 85. And the new executives expect less. ''Salaries in the Southeast do rise more slowly than in the Northeast,'' said Mr. O'Grady, who is senior vice president for administration.</p>
        <p>Companies have been migrating for decades, of course, moving operations both within the United States and overseas for many reasons, including the search for cheaper labor. But since 1996, corporate migration within the country has soared, roughly doubling to more than 11,000 moves a year, according to Site Selection Magazine of Atlanta, the only organization, public or private, to track the phenomenon. At the same time, the emphasis has shifted from factories, the traditional migrants, to every type of service operation, and across a range of jobs, from Rayonier's six-figure executives to call center operators earning $7 an hour.</p>
        <p>The increasing restlessness of American business is beginning to be noticed by economists, government officials and industry groups. ''Corporate migration within the United States is definitely accelerating,'' said Allen J. Scott, a geographer at the University of California at Los Angeles who specializes in economic issues. ''The booming economy is prodding companies to relocate or expand in new places.''</p>
        <p>As labor shortages and competition for workers drive up wages in one city, companies have shifted work or have expanded in another location, where the same tasks can be done at lower pay. This movement helps to answer one of the big questions about the recent economy: How has the United States managed to achieve its lowest unemployment rate since the 1960's and yet not experience as much upward pressure on wages as it has during past booms, even when labor markets were not as tight as they are today?</p>
        <p>Various explanations have been offered by economists for the failure of labor shortages to give a bigger kick to wages in the record long expansion that started in 1991: weaker unions, the greater use of temporary workers, a minimum wage that has lost value, a flood of immigrant workers, layoffs and job insecurity, global competition. Often overlooked, however, has been the impact of the stepped-up rate of corporate migration, which adds another critical element to the mix.</p>
        <p>But if lower labor costs drive the process, technology greases the way. High-speed telecommunications and fiber optic lines, now available almost everywhere in the country, allow a Rayonier to communicate as easily from Jacksonville as from Stamford, and they also allow a great variety of service companies to link operations in different cities, as if these operations were all in one office. In addition, the talent pool is more evenly spread across the country in the 1990's than in earlier generations, said Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard economist, meaning ''you can find similar labor forces and similar amenities in many more places in America.''</p>
        <p>While technology facilitates corporate migration, so does the growing use of call centers to deal with the public. Many companies use centers to take orders for merchandise, to service credit cards, to handle securities transactions, to give investment advice, to help owners of computers solve software problems, to collect debts, to sell insurance, to help people navigate the Internet. No one has yet counted all the call center operators, not even the Labor Department, but their importance is beginning to rival that of assembly line workers 50 years ago. And call centers, generally requiring only telephones and desk-top computers, are much more mobile than factories.</p>
        <p>Mid-sized cities in the Southeast and Southwest are prime targets of the corporate migration, cities like Charlotte, Memphis, Phoenix and Jacksonville. But companies have also been drawn in growing numbers to the Midwestern states or to Maine or Pennsylvania or Kentucky -- to any place, in fact, that offers lower wages and public subsidies. Maine has fewer than 6,000 people making shoes, less than half the number it had in 1985, but out-of-state retailers, banks, pharmaceutical companies, even a newspaper clipping service, have placed operations in the old shoe towns, re-employing workers.</p>
        <p>''Companies are searching for pockets of unemployment,'' said Steven H. Levesque, commissioner of Maine's Department of Economic and Community Development, ''and Maine has these pockets.''</p>
        <p>Spreading the Jobs  Mobility Restrains Wage Momentum</p>
        <p>The stepped-up corporate migration has spread jobs and living standards more evenly across the country than in some earlier expansions. Rather than expand several of its operations in New York or New Jersey, for example, Merrill Lynch has gradually added 2,000 employees here in Jacksonville, locating them in four imposing pink stone office buildings on a bucolic site in a suburban office park.</p>
        <p>For a migrating company, the money saved in labor costs often goes into earnings, helping to explain the extraordinary profitability of American business in recent years, economists say. And by lowering labor costs, corporate migration serves to keep inflation under control. But it also serves as a counterweight to the social benefit of a low unemployment rate. The ability to move almost any kind of work easily gives employers a more powerful response to the demands of their employees for greater pay.</p>
        <p>''Not just the greater mobility, but the threat of it helps to hold down wages,'' Mr. Katz said.</p>
        <p>Even so, average hourly earnings have risen faster than inflation in the boom years since 1996, the first time that has happened for so long a stretch since the 1960's and early 70's. But compare the 1990's with those earlier decades and a more complex story emerges. Wages moved up more persistently in the 60's as the unemployment rate fell. In response, the inflation rate also rose more in the 60's than it did in the 90's. Corporate migration has helped, in effect, to hold down labor costs and prices.</p>
        <p>Public attention has focused on manufacturers that shift factories abroad, particularly to Mexico and the Far East. But corporate migration within the United States, which dawdled along at fewer than 5,200 occurrences annually from 1980 through 1994, jumped in the late 1990's to more than 11,400, according to Site Selection's research.</p>
        <p>The organization's totals cover not only corporate migrations but also the initial investments of newly started companies. Because only the largest start-ups are counted, however, they represent only 10 percent of each year's total, says Jack Lynes, Site Selection's executive editor. The totals, including the start-ups, reached 12,702 in 1999. Before 1995, the high point was 5,686 in 1989, the last full year of the previous expansion.</p>
        <p>Responding to a request for data on corporate migration, the American Management Association polled 63 of its chief executives last month, asking by e-mail whether they intended to relocate their headquarters. Forty-two percent said they had either recently relocated or were actively considering doing so.</p>
        <p>''You have to conclude that relocating operations is very much on the agenda of corporate America,'' said Eric Greenberg, the association's director of surveys.</p>
        <p>The continuing migration of millions of families to the Sun Belt and the Mountain States serves as a magnet for many companies. The labor force has grown more rapidly in these regions than in the Northeast or Midwest. In Jacksonville, for example, the labor force has been growing at 3 percent a year since 1990, or three times as fast as the national average.</p>
        <p>As a result, skilled executives -- accountants, financial analysts, personnel managers and computer specialists -- are finally as easy for Rayonier to find here as they are in the Northeast, Mr. O'Grady says.</p>
        <p>''These are people who have moved for the amenities of life,'' said Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist, ''and in some long-run sense their wages are going to be relatively low because they want to be there.''</p>
        <p>Rayonier is the 19th large company to move an operation to Jacksonville this year, or expand one here, and the company is still unpacking. Paintings are propped against a wall in the conference room, waiting to be hung. Potted plants will also decorate the room, Mr. O'Grady promises, and out in the lobby the black plastic counter encircling the receptionist's station will soon be changed for a green marble one, matching the green in the new carpet.</p>
        <p>Rayonier's headquarters had been in Stamford for 20 years and in Manhattan for 30 years before that. Its new executives in Jacksonville earn $85,000 and up, some as much as $175,000 a year. For that sort of money, Mr. O'Grady said, the pickings are better and the turnover less.</p>
        <p>''You have more people competing for our jobs at this pay range,'' he said. And the quality is better. In the Northeast, you get a personnel executive, for example, with experience only in workmen's compensation, Mr. O'Grady explained. ''Here, for the same pay, they also have experience in medical and dental insurance and 401(k) plans. You get a broader experience base.''</p>
        <p>There are other advantages. Office space is cheaper, and because headquarters is now ''closer to the bulk of our operations,'' Mr. O'Grady said, fewer executives are needed. The company likes to promote from within, but getting promising employees to transfer to Stamford was harder and more expensive than bringing them here is likely to be. Housing costs are less, the climate milder, and the beaches spectacular. The Jaguar football team also figures as a draw in the Rayonier calculation, Mr. O'Grady said.</p>
        <p>''I have a new condo here,'' said Mr. O'Grady, who transferred to Jacksonville himself in the spring, ''and I asked my neighbors, 'Where are you from?' and I would bet 80 percent are from other places.''</p>
        <p>Have Jobs, Will Travel  More Places Seen As Viable Locales</p>
        <p>Companies that once put down deep roots are also showing up in Colorado, Idaho, Texas, Nevada, Utah, Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio -- just about everywhere.</p>
        <p>But the South is still a favorite. People have been migrating to the South for more than a generation, and now their children, those raised and educated in Jacksonville, for example, are everywhere at Merrill Lynch. William A. Bridy, Merrill's senior director in Jacksonville, often recruits graduates of the University of North Florida, whose campus, with 12,000 students, is only three miles away. Recent graduates are among the 25 ''profilers'' stationed at Merrill's suburban campus.</p>
        <p>Merrill developed profiling at its Somerset, N.J., office, using the profilers to build a database of biographical information on new clients for  use as a tool in selling more services. The expansion, seven months ago, was in Jacksonville and Denver.</p>
        <p>Here a profiler's starting wage of $26,000 is 10 to 20 percent less than in New Jersey, Mr. Bridy said. ''There is not the demand for New Jersey wages,'' he said, adding that if labor costs do rise, Jacksonville will become less attractive. That is beginning to happen in Denver. ''The problem you have there is turnover, which is higher than Jacksonville,'' Mr. Bridy said.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the corporate migration is only a few counties away. Pressed by the Big Three automakers to hold down prices, some parts manufacturers are shifting from the Detroit environs to Traverse City and other locations in upstate Michigan, where wages are lower. Principal Financial Group, which manages pension plans for thousands of companies, found that wages were rising in Des Moines, its headquarters city, for the counselors who field telephone calls from people seeking information about their plans or shifting investments. So work has been moved, through computer links, to offices in Waterloo and Ottumwa, Iowa, where wages for counselors with the same skills are 5 to 10 percent lower than in Des Moines.</p>
        <p>Burrelle's Information Services is a constant migrant. The company employs nearly 2,000 people who cull newspaper, magazine, video and Internet citations for corporate customers. As wages rose in Livingston, N.J., its headquarters, and business grew, the company added an office in Salt Lake City, then Presque Isle, Me., and most recently in Houlton, Me. -- all in a successful effort to keep the hourly wage of most of the employees below $10.</p>
        <p>''The unemployment rate is a little higher in Houlton than in Presque Isle because it does not have an airport and tends to be bypassed by other companies,'' said Robert Waggoner, chief executive at Burrelle's. ''You have to be adventurous in finding new places.''</p>
        <p>Vying for Better Jobs  Towns Try to Draw The Better Wages</p>
        <p>While Maine, with an unemployment rate of 5 percent or more in many towns and cities, vies to attract lower-wage jobs -- or any jobs -- Jacksonville is taking a different tack. The unemployment rate here has fallen to 3.1 percent from 6.6 percent in 1992, and with the pressure reduced to bring in jobs, whatever they pay, the Chamber of Commerce and the Economic Development Commission are trying to attract companies with jobs that pay more than $31,000.</p>
        <p>Boeing, the aerospace giant, is one beneficiary. Servicing and overhauling aircraft is a growing part of its business, but rather than expand repair centers in Wichita, Seattle or St. Louis, where mechanics earn $20 an hour and up, Boeing has opened a center in Jacksonville. So have Northrop Grumman and Jet Turbine Services. Skilled mechanics, trained in the Navy and mustering out here, sign on for $18 an hour or less.</p>
        <p>''You go where the workers are,'' said Dee Burcham, manager of Boeing's Jacksonville repair center.</p>
        <p>The Navy has a big presence in Jacksonville, but part of its complex, Cecil Field, an air station, was closed and turned over to the city last fall. Now the city is leasing hangar space to Boeing and others for the give-away price of $1.50 a square foot.</p>
        <p>''We are pump priming,'' said Paul Krutko, a director of the Economic Development Commission. ''Later the rates will go up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burcham, the Boeing manager, whose 55 employees will rise to 120 by January, acknowledges that Cecil Field's subsidized facilities were an important lure. ''All we had to do was organize a work force and we were up and running,'' he said. But he gave equal billing to ''the availability of knowledgeable aviation mechanics and electricians'' at $18 an hour or less.</p>
        <p>They are people like Michael Zipp, 39, who trained in the Marines as an aviation electrician. He joined Grumman in Bethpage, N.Y., in the early 1980's, long before its merger with Northrop. Earning $17.50 an hour, with a wife and four children, he could not make ends meet on Long Island, he said. So he quit in 1988, moved himself and his family to nearby St. Augustine, where Grumman had an operation, and rejoined the company at $10 an hour.</p>
        <p>Even at that lower wage, he says, he could finally afford to pay his bills and, for the first time, purchase a home. Only now, more than a decade later, has his wage risen back to its old level of $17.50 an hour. He is aware that people with his skills earn more elsewhere in the country. The starting wage in Wichita, for example, where Boeing also has operations, is $25 an hour, he says.</p>
        <p>Why not move? ''I'm settled here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Son of Call Center  Jacksonville Chafes At Label, and Jobs</p>
        <p>Jacksonville got its start in economic development as a mecca for call centers, thanks to AT&amp;T, which set up a center here in 1983, after the phone company's breakup, to handle queries from shareholders whose stock was split. Inexpensive land drew more call centers, and Florida's status as a largely nonunion, right to work state.</p>
        <p>Public subsidies also helped. They still do, although they are angled now toward companies like Boeing and Rayonier, which is receiving from the city a $1.8 million cash grant for bringing its headquarters here and additional ''incentives,'' as Mr. O'Grady calls them, from the state government.</p>
        <p>But for all the efforts of the city fathers to bring higher paying jobs to Jacksonville, the call centers still play a dominant role. America Online, Citibank, Bank of America, MediaOne all have a big presence here. ''We have gone from being a call center town to wanting to not be called a call center town,'' said Faye Kullberg, director of human resources for MediaOne.</p>
        <p>Few companies employ more people here than a descendant of the original AT&amp;T call center, now part of a company called Convergys, based in Cincinnati. Convergys has 37 call centers nationwide, with 45,000 employees, including 4,500 here. The operators do not mention Convergys; they take on the identity of the companies that purchase its services. A recent client is AT&amp;T Wireless, whose cell phone customers get a Convergys operator when they call an 800 number for help.</p>
        <p>But Convergys has not expanded recently in Jacksonville. The pay for call center operators has risen by about $2 an hour in the last 18 months, to between $10 and $12 an hour. Turnover is also rising, and Jacksonville is losing its luster as a suitable site for low-wage call centers. So Convergys opened its newest center in Brownsville, Tex.</p>
        <p>''We pay the same in Brownsville as in Jacksonville,'' said Frank Kelly, a Convergys executive, ''but the unemployment rate there reached 14 percent, and we were able to hire very good people. They consider our job to be a white collar job.''</p>
