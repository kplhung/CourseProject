        <p>There is a disturbing, almost willfully irresponsible quality to the giddy rush by politicians to enact huge federal tax cuts without regard to how much of the projected surpluses are real, and with little or no debate about other, better ways in which some of that money might be used.</p>
        <p>It's as if very little was learned during those long years of wandering in the debilitating environs of big budget deficits. Now surpluses are blossoming in the midst of a campaign season and the politicians seem determined to devour them with immediate and mindless tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Forget about taking steps to shore up the nation's infrastructure, or clean up the environment, or do something real about the sorry state of public education, or poverty, or the millions who lack health insurance.</p>
        <p>Forget about any of the complex issues that deserve to be debated and that would require some substantial amount of federal financial support. Big tax cuts are on the table, and even bigger tax cuts are being promised. And once these monster cuts become law there'll be very little left for investment in a sounder American future.</p>
        <p>According to Congressional Budget Office projections released last week, the non-Social Security surpluses over the next 10 years will be about $2.2 trillion. But that figure is wildly unrealistic. It would be reduced sharply by any slowdown in the economy, and it assumes non-entitlement spending, including defense spending, will grow no faster than the rate of inflation -- a phenomenon that no sane person in Washington would believe.</p>
        <p>Analysts at the respected Center on Budget and Policy Priorities have come up with estimates that fit more comfortably with the real world. They noted that when you set aside that portion of the projected surpluses that come from the Medicare trust fund (which, like Social Security, should remain off limits, according to officials from both parties); and when you look realistically at spending already committed to by the White House and Congress; and when you take into account some of the non-Social Security money that most agree will be needed to help shore up the Social Security retirement system -- when you take all of that into account, the surplus available over the next decade falls to just $700 billion or so.</p>
        <p>That's the amount that would be available for tax cuts and new spending. If you wanted to improve the schools, or help cover the uninsured, or offer a prescription drug benefit, or whatever -- you'd have to pay for it out of that $700 billion or so, after you deduct whatever tax cuts come out of that same $700 billion.</p>
        <p>Candidates from both parties have been less than responsible on this issue. But the Republicans, especially, have gone way over the top.</p>
        <p>To get a sense of how dizzily out of whack things have become, all you have to do is consider that George W. Bush's proposed tax cut is $1.3 trillion. There is no way the non-Social Security surpluses projected over the next decade would be able to cover tax cuts of that magnitude.</p>
        <p>Tax cut bills passed or about to be passed in this session of Congress (some face a presidential veto) would reduce government revenues by $730 billion over the next 10 years. Not only are the tax cuts being pushed by the G.O.P. excessive, they are in many cases ''backloaded,'' which is to say written in such a way that the biggest portion of the cuts occur after some years have passed. So the proposed elimination of the estate tax, for example, would result in a loss of $100 billion in revenue over the first 10 years, but more than $500 billion over the second 10 years.</p>
        <p>This is insidious. We are manufacturing rather than solving problems for subsequent generations.</p>
        <p>Modest, affordable tax cuts are fine. But what's more important as the United States enjoys this best of economic times is to take the opportunity to engage some of the big problems we've put off for years because we didn't have the money to deal with them.</p>
        <p>There are Americans who, despite the unprecedented prosperity, still are not being paid an honest dollar for a day's work, who still are without health insurance, who still are not receiving a quality education.</p>
        <p>Now would be a good time to start bringing them into the prosperous mainstream.</p>
