        <p>With stakes mounting as the Camp David summit meeting nears its third week, President Clinton returned to negotiations tonight, and officials suggested that the talks, now centered on the future of Jerusalem, could break apart in the next day or solidify into a deal.</p>
        <p>Adding a new aura of gravity to the talks, the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, traveled to Saudi Arabia to ensure Saudi support for Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, in the crucial debate over Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>The diplomacy by Mr. Mubarak, who maintains the best relations with Mr. Arafat of any Arab leader, was seen by the Israelis and the Americans as an effort to build a wall of Arab solidarity behind the Palestinian leader.</p>
        <p>The Americans made it plain through the State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, that the summit meeting would not go on indefinitely and could reach a make-or-break point as soon as Monday.</p>
        <p>''We are not here for an unlimited period of time,'' Mr. Boucher said. The president will be given an immediate assessment, and this will be ''very important'' in how the talks move, he said.</p>
        <p>Privately, American officials suggested that if progress was not made by Monday, it would be difficult to keep going. If the talks moved toward midweek, they added, this would be a sign that things were going well.</p>
        <p>At his summer retreat outside Rome, Pope John Paul II entered the Camp David debate, exhorting the summit leaders in his weekly Sunday address to adopt a long-held Vatican position that a special international status be extended to the holy sites in the Old City of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>As important figures on the outside tried to influence the conference, Mr. Clinton left behind the relative calm of an uncontentious economic summit meeting in Japan, and entered what several accounts suggested was a razor-edge atmosphere among the Israelis and Palestinians at Camp David.</p>
        <p>To relieve the tensions, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, got some distraction by visiting the Civil War battlefields at Gettysburg today with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. Mr. Arafat relaxed at Dr. Albright's Virginia farm, where she served him lunch on Saturday.</p>
        <p>But these outings were mere interludes in a process that is inexorably building toward a climax. The conference went into its 13th day today, the entire duration of the first Middle East peace conference at Camp David in 1978 under the auspices of President Jimmy Carter.</p>
        <p>The Israelis have said Mr. Barak is willing to make concessions on Jerusalem, though it is far from clear that they would be enough for Mr. Arafat. Gadi Baltiansky, Mr. Barak's spokesman, suggested that talks had entered the critical phase.</p>
        <p>''It won't take a lot of time,'' he said. ''President Clinton will return to Camp David, and then we will see if there is any point in staying here and going on with the talks, or to pack the luggage and go home.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Clinton's absence, the stakes grew in a variety of ways.</p>
        <p>In a letter he wrote to Mr. Clinton before the summit meeting was pronounced dead and then swiftly revived on Wednesday night, Mr. Barak stated, according to leaks in the Israeli press, that if the meeting ended with no overall accord, he would walk away even from points he had agreed to.</p>
        <p>The Americans have suggested that they may be facing an all-or-nothing outcome and a situation at the very end in which Mr. Clinton will be trying to salvage something from the rubble of a blowup over Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>One way of looking at the negotiations as they unfold now, according to this scenario, is comparing them to pushing a rock up a hill. If a full agreement formally bringing an end to the 52-year-old conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians is not achieved, then the progress on some less explosive issues, like the shape of a new Palestinian state and the fate of Palestinian refugees, could be wiped out as the rock rolls back down the slope.</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Clinton left for Japan, he and his negotiators, according to Israeli and Palestinian reports, presented some compromise solutions for Jerusalem. They centered on degrees of sovereignty in East Jerusalem for the Palestinians, who claim all of East Jerusalem as the capital of their new Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>The principle of the American compromise appears to be virtually full sovereignty for the Palestinians over Palestinian villages in East Jerusalem and what one expert called a ''sense of sovereignty'' over the Muslim religious sites in the center of the Old City.</p>
        <p>The proposals reportedly envision some form of ''shared sovereignty'' over some of the parts of East Jerusalem adjacent to the eastern part of the Old City.</p>
        <p>The reports in Israel say that these are ideas that Mr. Barak has agreed to and that they are concessions that go far beyond what any other Israeli leader has made.</p>
        <p>Some of the Israeli accounts of the American proposal -- which is believed to have been amended in Mr. Clinton's absence -- report that a final decision on the status of the Old City, holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, would be deferred.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian reports say those ideas are not sufficient for Mr. Arafat to make a deal. Officials who have been in touch with the Palestinian delegation report that Mr. Arafat is unimpressed by the American proposals. Given the negotiators' agreement not to speak to reporters, it is impossible to know how much those descriptions of a defiant Mr. Arafat are for home consumption or how much they reflect a true picture.</p>
        <p>One of the Palestinian negotiators, Abu Mazen, who had left the talks to return home, came back today saying a partial agreement was not in the cards.</p>
        <p>A senior Palestinian official, Tayeb Abdel Rahim, was downbeat in a speech tonight at the Egyptian Consulate in Gaza. ''The Palestinian delegation has achieved no progress in the important issues of the negotiations, such as Jerusalem, settlements, the return of refuges and borders,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak's visit to King Fahd in Saudi Arabia also raised the stakes because the Saudi royal family is the protector of Mecca and Medina, the two holiest Islamic sites, and has a huge interest in the Islamic site in East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, the Egyptian and Jordanian foreign ministers met to discuss the Camp David talks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat has often contended that he does not have a mandate from Arabs and Muslims to cede sovereignty to Israel in East Jerusalem and, in particular, over the Muslim and Christian religious sites.</p>
        <p>In East Jerusalem, Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary, known to Jews as Temple Mount, is the third holiest Muslim site, consisting of Al Aksa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock. The complex was in the custody of the Jordanian royal family until the Israelis pushed the Jordanians out of East Jerusalem in 1967.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Arafat considered what to do about East Jerusalem, he got pressure from another quarter today. The leader of the militant Hamas movement, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said in Gaza that he would be willing to declare a truce with Israel only if Israel agreed to withdraw completely to the 1967 borders from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>The pope's appeal was based on a longstanding view of the Roman Catholic Church that the Israeli conquest of East Jerusalem and its annexation to Israel was an act of occupation. In February, the Vatican signed an accord with the Palestinians calling for freedom of worship in all holy sites of East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>In his address at his summer retreat, Castel Gandolfo, the pope said, ''The Holy See continues to maintain that only a special statute internationally guaranteed can effectively preserve the most sacred areas of the Holy City.''</p>
        <p>Such international safeguards would ''ensure freedom of religion and of worship for all the faithful who, in the region and the entire world, look to Jerusalem as a crossroads of peace and of coexistence,'' the pope said, invoking the city's ''holy places and the three monotheistic religions that surround them.''</p>
        <p>As he left the White House for Camp David, Mr. Clinton held up his hands and mouthed the words ''I have my fingers crossed.''</p>
