        <p>In a highly unusual step for a labor union, New York's largest union of health care workers has printed and distributed more than 10,000 copies of a 12-page tribute to Cardinal John J. O'Connor.</p>
        <p>The tribute calls the cardinal, who died in May, ''the patron saint of working people'' and describes his support of workers, especially low-wage ones -- helping limousine drivers unionize, using his influence to help end the strike at The Daily News in 1990, and pushing for fringe benefits for minimum-wage home health care workers.</p>

        <p>In a highly unusual step for a labor union, New York's largest union of health care workers has printed and distributed more than 10,000 copies of a 12-page tribute to Cardinal John J. O'Connor.</p>
        <p>The tribute calls the cardinal, who died in May, ''the patron saint of working people'' and describes his support of workers, especially low-wage ones -- helping limousine drivers unionize, using his influence to help end the strike at The Daily News in 1990, and pushing for fringe benefits for minimum-wage home health care workers.</p>
        <p>In publishing the unusual tribute this month, the union, 1199/S.E.I.U., New York's Health and Human Service Union, may have been hoping to nudge the cardinal's successor as the leader of the Archdiocese of New York, Archbishop Edward M. Egan, to follow the cardinal's example.</p>
        <p>New York's union leaders have heard reports from their counterparts in Connecticut, where Archbishop Egan was bishop of Bridgeport, that he was less than friendly to labor. Indeed, several prominent Connecticut labor leaders said he often refused requests to meet with them.</p>
        <p>''He wasn't a friend of our union,'' said Jerome Brown, president of the New England Health Care Employees Union, which often called on Bishop Egan to intervene in labor disputes involving Roman Catholic hospitals and nursing homes. ''We tried to have a dialogue with him, and he ignored us. That starts to be pretty close to being an enemy.''</p>
        <p>Tom Drohan, a spokesman for the Diocese of Bridgeport, said Archbishop Egan strongly believed in the church's pro-labor stands, among them Pope John Paul II's 1981 encyclical, ''On Human Work,'' which calls unions ''a mouthpiece for the struggle for social justice.''</p>
        <p>In the past, Archbishop Egan has spoken on the church's relationship with workers, saying: ''The Catholic Church has a longstanding tradition of support for working men and women. We will always stay true to that tradition.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Drohan said the archbishop had considered it inappropriate to intervene in labor negotiations at Catholic health care institutions in Connecticut, believing that the bargaining should be left to those institutions' professional negotiators. That is a sharp difference from Cardinal O'Connor, who often encouraged negotiators at Catholic hospitals to be as generous as possible with their employees.</p>
        <p>Speaking of Archbishop Egan, Mr. Drohan said: ''He supports his negotiators as long as they're fair to the workers. He is not a man who walks out in front of his building and says, 'I want that.' He lets the negotiators do their jobs. He supports them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Drohan said he could not cite an example of Archbishop Egan's intervening in a labor dispute, the way Cardinal O'Connor often did, to push management to be more generous or to accuse management of being immoral for using permanent replacement workers during strikes.</p>
        <p>New York's labor leaders remain uncertain of Archbishop Egan, and many of them voice hope that in New York, where labor is much stronger than it is in Connecticut, the new archbishop will be more pro-union.</p>
        <p>''I hope and pray he will be as supportive toward labor as the cardinal was,'' said Brian McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council, which represents more than one million workers.</p>
        <p>Labor leaders who rarely speak with reverence about anybody sometimes grow teary-eyed in discussing the cardinal. Dennis Rivera, president of 1199 in New York, spoke fondly of how, during a 1989 labor dispute involving more than 40,000 workers at 61 New York hospitals and nursing homes, the cardinal helped break a deadlock by having five Catholic hospitals accept a union offer that had been rejected by the other hospitals. The cardinal's move pressured the other institutions into accepting a similar offer.</p>
        <p>The cardinal said he told his negotiators, ''Do not go into negotiations with a determination to give the union as little as possible.'' Rather, he said, ''find out the maximum we can give and offer the maximum immediately.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera, whose union represents 200,000 workers at hospitals and nursing homes, said, ''He was a very important figure in the lives of our organization and was a defender of the rights of working people.''</p>
        <p>The union's tribute describes the cardinal's views on the importance of unions, the right to strike, the right to organize and the immorality of using permanent replacement workers during strikes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera's union has sent copies to the union's 5,000 shop stewards and to more than 6,000 union members working at Catholics hospitals and nursing homes in New York. The brochure was also sent to the managers of 1,500 Catholic hospitals and nursing homes around the nation.</p>
        <p>Printing and distributing the tribute cost the union more than $10,000, an expense that Mr. Rivera said was worthwhile: ''We thought it was very important for future generations of trade unionists and Roman Catholics to know of the views of his eminence, John Cardinal O'Connor. We thought it was important to preserve his teachings and practices.''</p>
        <p>Some Connecticut labor leaders questioned whether the archbishop would ever align himself with labor. They recalled a contract dispute at St. Vincent's Hospital in Bridgeport when Bishop Egan was on the board. When negotiations were deadlocked, he refused to meet with union leaders to end the impasse.</p>
        <p>What made labor leaders far angrier were demands made by management's negotiators at St. Michael's Cemetery in Stratford, Conn., which was run by the Bridgeport Diocese. Those negotiators demanded that the new contract drop the provision requiring that all workers join the union. Instead, they demanded an open shop -- one that allows employees to work without having to join the union or pay union dues.</p>
        <p>The labor movement has long attacked open shops, saying they weaken union treasuries and allow nonunion employees to receive services, like lawyers to handle grievances, paid for by their co-workers.</p>
