        <p>For nearly a decade, a small-town New York police detective was sure he knew who had killed Yolina Arcenia Camacho, a hotel chambermaid, in a fit of rage in front of three witnesses. He knew where to find him. He even had the man's home phone number.</p>

        <p>For nearly a decade, a small-town New York police detective was sure he knew who had killed Yolina Arcenia Camacho, a hotel chambermaid, in a fit of rage in front of three witnesses. He knew where to find him. He even had the man's home phone number.</p>
        <p>The detective, Gene Buonanno, a 32-year veteran of the Tarrytown Police Department, just as surely knew that going after the man, the victim's husband, would be difficult. He had fled to the Dominican Republic, and for years the authorities there had failed to respond to American pressure to extradite him.</p>
        <p>But after a nine-year effort that led to a flurry of coverage in the Dominican news media and prompted a United States congressman to block $6 million in aid to the Caribbean nation unless the fugitive was returned, Detective Buonanno was in a celebratory mood yesterday.</p>
        <p>His quarry, Carlos Grullon, 36, had left his country with United States Marshals Service deputies in pursuit. On Friday, he was taken into custody at a hotel in Panama and promptly flown to Miami. At some point this week, possibly as early as today, Mr. Grullon could be on a plane back to the New York area to face arraignment on murder charges in the death of Yolina Arcenia Camacho.</p>
        <p>''It's all over for him; he's on American soil now,'' said Detective Buonanno, head of the detective bureau in Tarrytown. ''For nine years, he's been running free with his nose in the air and defiant, with no fear of coming back to this country to pay for this terrible crime that was committed.''</p>
        <p>News of the arrest was welcomed by a large, close-knit family that never lost hope that Mr. Grullon would be arrested, and by law enforcement officials who had been pressing the Dominican authorities over the case for years.</p>
        <p>''I'm very happy,'' said Ms. Camacho's mother, Juana Camacho, of Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., who has been raising her deceased daughter's children, Dahiana, 15, and Richard, 10. ''We know that now it will be nine years in October -- the pain and desperation are over. We can now see him face justice. That's what we wanted, justice.''</p>
        <p>For years, though, the possibility that Mr. Grullon would be arrested seemed unlikely.</p>
        <p>Soon after the police said Mr. Grullon shot his wife in the basement of the Tarrytown Hilton Inn on Oct. 26, 1991, he fled from a tightening police dragnet for his native Dominican Republic. The news was not welcomed by local law enforcement officials, who had seen hundreds of suspected criminals elude American authorities by flying to a country where a weak judicial system, corruption and, until recently, the law made it difficult to extradite suspects.</p>
        <p>''One of the problems is that over the years, the Dominican Republic has become a safe haven for Dominican criminals,'' said United States Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, who represents Westchester County and is chairman of the House International Relations Committee.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Grullon was arrested in his wife's slaying soon after his arrival in the Dominican Republic, he was released on bail in 1992, and, until recently, lived a life of relative ease, Detective Buonanno said.</p>
        <p>This year, a Dominican court tried and convicted Mr. Grullon on the murder charge in absentia, sentencing him to 30 years in prison. American officials, though, were opposed to the judicial proceeding because they thought there was no way to ensure that he would serve a lengthy sentence. Furthermore, his conviction on the island would make any future extradition on the same charges nearly impossible.</p>
        <p>''The charade that went on, that he had already been tried in the Dominican Republic, was an affront to the American criminal justice system,'' said Jeanine F. Pirro, the district attorney in Westchester County. ''They said they had their own trial. With what evidence, I can't imagine. But you can't play those games, no matter who you are. If you take a life, you're accountable.''</p>
        <p>Detective Buonanno had meanwhile continued to stay on top of the case by keeping in touch with relatives of Ms. Camacho in the Dominican Republic and in Westchester County, as well as with American diplomatic officials who were following the case. ''We used to call on a monthly basis, and I used to constantly ask for help, asking, 'Tell me where he's hanging out, who he's going out with, who he's dating,' '' the detective said.</p>
        <p>He also made it a point to summon Spanish-language reporters from the metropolitan area to urge them to do stories about the investigation and the two children Ms. Camacho left behind. Soon, the Dominican news media was covering the case, ensuring that Mr. Grullon had lost his relative anonymity.</p>
        <p>Through it all, Detective Buonanno said he remained frustrated. He said he knew Mr. Grullon's address and phone number. He said he also was angered after Ms. Camacho's relatives told him that Mr. Grullon had threatened them, at one point even firing a revolver over their home.</p>
        <p>The pressure on the Dominican authorities, though, began to mount. Officials began to cooperate in February after Representative Gilman announced that he was using his power as chairman of the International Relations Committee to block $8 million in aid to the Dominican Republic. The committee eventually released $2 million in humanitarian aid, but the rest has been held up until now, he said.</p>
        <p>John D. Amat, a deputy United States marshal in Miami and a spokesman for the Marshals Service, said that two deputy marshals, working out of an office the agency opened in the Dominican Republic in February to track fugitives, began to closely trail Mr. Grullon. Apparently feeling the heat, Mr. Grullon flew to Venezuela, Detective Buonanno said, and then to Panama.</p>
        <p>The marshals, along with United States immigration officials and Panamanian authorities, found Mr. Grullon at a Panama City hotel. American officials had a federal warrant for Mr. Grullon's arrest --  he had been indicted in Westchester County on murder charges in December 1991 -- and Panamanian authorities quickly expelled him because of the falsified identification papers the authorities had found in his possession. The two marshals then transported Mr. Grullon to Miami on a commercial airliner.</p>
        <p>Detective Buonanno said yesterday that he was awaiting word from Miami about whether Mr. Grullon would waive New York's extradition request. But he was not waiting to enjoy the latest developments.</p>
        <p>''It's tremendous,'' Detective Buonanno said. ''When I called the family and told them, they said they knew it would happen someday and that day has come, and now they can feel peace of mind. He's on our soil. There's a lot of work left to be done, but at least he's on our soil.''</p>
