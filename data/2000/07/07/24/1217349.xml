        <p>There is some uncertainty about how many software programmers, or developers, there are in America. Estimates by the government and private research firms range from fewer than 700,000 to 2.5 million.</p>
        <p>But there is wide agreement that there are too few programmers, and that the shortage can only get worse.</p>
        <p>Money is not the issue. These are high-paying jobs, well into six figures for elite programmers.</p>
        <p>Image, it seems, is the problem. Most teenagers around the country still think of programmers as socially inept nerds, according to focus groups and a series of town meetings conducted last year by the Commerce Department.</p>
        <p>''The work is seen as boring, difficult and solitary,'' said Kelly Carnes, assistant secretary for technology policy at the Commerce Department.</p>
        <p>The image problem is especially pronounced among teenage girls. ''It's seen as not cool and you don't have boyfriends,'' Ms. Carnes noted.</p>
        <p>To burnish the image of programmers -- and encourage more young people to go into the field -- the Commerce Department is planning an advertising campaign this fall.</p>
        <p>The government, Ms. Carnes says, has not yet decided whether it will use celebrities, teenagers or programmers to make the pitch. But the message, she said, will be that programming is ''cool, exciting and you can do it.''</p>
