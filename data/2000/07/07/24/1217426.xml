        <p>For the second time in two months, Tiger Woods rewrote the record book and reaffirmed his place in golf history.</p>
        <p>With an eight-stroke victory at the 129th British Open today, Woods, 24, became the youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam, winning all four major championships.

        <p>For the second time in two months, Tiger Woods rewrote the record book and reaffirmed his place in golf history.</p>
        <p>With an eight-stroke victory at the 129th British Open today, Woods, 24, became the youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam, winning all four major championships. Woods has also won the 1997 Masters, the 1999 P.G.A. Championship and this year's United States Open, which he won by 15 strokes, the largest victory margin in major championship history.</p>
        <p>Only five players have captured the career Grand Slam -- Woods, Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus. But nobody has done it more quickly or more decisively than Woods. Today's winning score of 19-under-par 269 set a major championships  record for strokes under par, surpassing Nick Faldo's winning score of 18 under in 1990. Woods now holds three major championship scoring records: the Masters (18 under), the United States Open (12 under) and today's British Open record, which was accomplished at a symbolic setting, the Old Course at St. Andrews, where golf has been played for centuries but where no one has played it quite like Woods.</p>
        <p>Dominating the world's best players, Woods cruised to victory ahead of Ernie Els and Thomas Bjorn, who tied for second place at 11 under par. It was another performance that left Woods in a familiar place, in a class by himself. At an age when most people are starting careers, Woods has made a lasting mark in his. After hoisting and kissing the claret jug, the trophy awarded to the winner of golf's oldest major championship, Woods admitted he had captured the career Grand Slam even faster than he had anticipated when he turned professional in 1996.</p>
        <p>''So far, I've had a wonderful young career, and hopefully I can continue to have success,'' said Woods, who won $759,150 and became the first player to win two consecutive majors since Nick Price won the British Open and the P.G.A. Championship in 1994. ''There's no substitute for understanding what it takes to win.</p>
        <p>''It's really hard to put into words the emotions and feelings going through me. To complete the Slam at St. Andrews, where golf all started, makes it even more special.''</p>
        <p>Starting the final round with a six-stroke lead, Woods never led by less than three strokes in the final round. He pulled away by making birdies on three of his first five holes on the back nine, showing the consistency that has been his trademark at recent major championships. Woods made just one bogey today, on No. 17, the famous Road Hole, one of the world's hardest par-4's.</p>
        <p>How controlled was Woods's game? There are 112 bunkers on the Old Course, but Woods avoided all of them for 72 holes. And by making his final 6-foot putt at No. 18, Woods completed his fourth consecutive round in the 60's (67, 66, 67, 69), something he had never done in a major.</p>
        <p>At this point, Woods's peers are wondering what it will take to beat him, acknowledging that he is the world's best player, by a wide margin that appears to be growing. Woods has won 13 of his last 23 starts on the PGA Tour, and he already has 21 career victories. The record that Woods most covets belongs to Nicklaus, who won 18 major titles. But with four majors already, and winning at a faster pace than Nicklaus did, no record in golf appears to be out of Woods's grasp.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't that long ago that I said there would not be another Jack Nicklaus, but in fact we are looking at one,'' said Mark Calcavecchia, winner of the 1989 British Open who tied for 26th place today. ''He is the chosen one. He is the best player who has played the game right now, and he is only 24. Jack Nicklaus was the greatest of all time, and when all is said and done, he still might have the greatest record. But if Jack was in his prime today, I don't think he could keep up with Tiger.''</p>
        <p>David Duval, the world's No. 2-ranked player, could not keep up with Woods today. Woods and Duval were matched in the last group, the first time they had played together in the final round of a major. The showdown started well for Duval, who birdied four of the first seven holes, despite missing an 18-inch putt at No. 5, and closed his deficit to three strokes.</p>
        <p>But a turning point came at the par-4, 379-yard No. 10. Woods reached the green on his drive, then left his putt for eagle 10 feet short. After Duval left a 15-foot putt for birdie just short, Woods made a 14-footer for birdie to take a four-stroke lead. Then, at the par-4, 314-yard No. 12, Woods extended his lead back to six strokes, when he birdied and Duval bogeyed. Woods drove the green again, then two-putted. Meanwhile, Duval's drive was short of the green, he left a poor chip still 50 feet short of the cup, and from there he three-putted.</p>
        <p>Woods was six strokes ahead with six holes left, and Duval knew it was Woods's day. But at the Road Hole, the day took a cruel turn for Duval, who made a quadruple-bogey after hitting his second shot into the bunker. It took him four attempts to escape the bunker, which is about six feet high. His first two tries hit the wall of the bunker and came back. Then Duval was forced to take a backhand swipe at the ball in the sand, giving him enough room to finally hit the ball just over the bunker's top lip. That regrettable episode tumbled Duval into a tie for 11th place at seven under par. But there was no doubt in Duval's mind, or anyone else's, about who was No. 1.</p>
        <p>''It was a spectacular performance, to say the least,'' said Duval, who shot a final-round 75. ''He simply did not make mistakes.''</p>
        <p>As Woods walked down the 18th fairway, he was saluted with applause from fans in the grandstands and from the crowded gallery beside the green, which included his mother, Tida, and his girlfriend, Joanna Jagoda.</p>
        <p>Another milestone had been reached, another challenge had been met. Meanwhile, there was increased anticipation for the year's final major, the P.G.A. Championship in Louisville, Ky., Aug. 17-20, where Woods will try to become the first player to win three majors in one year since 1953, when Hogan won the Masters, the United States Open and the British Open.</p>
        <p>For this evening, Woods was content to savor a week that had ended the way he had hoped, with the claret jug in his hands and with more goals in sight. Asked how he felt, Woods smiled:</p>
        <p>''Not too bad.''</p>
