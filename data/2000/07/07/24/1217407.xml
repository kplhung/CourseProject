        <p>New York racing ended its spring and summer meeting at Belmont Park yesterday with some losses in attendance and betting handle, but with the exhilarating prospect of six weeks in Saratoga Springs starting on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The exodus began right after the ninth race yesterday, with a caravan of trucks moving office furniture, jockey silks and starting gates while the stream of horses continued to head for the quaint track 180 miles to the north. This will be the 132nd season of racing at Saratoga, an annual stay in the country where world-class horses gather for 35 stakes worth $8.7 million over the 36 racing days through Labor Day, Sept. 4. Then it's back to Belmont Park on Friday, Sept. 8.</p>

        <p>New York racing ended its spring and summer meeting at Belmont Park yesterday with some losses in attendance and betting handle, but with the exhilarating prospect of six weeks in Saratoga Springs starting on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The exodus began right after the ninth race yesterday, with a caravan of trucks moving office furniture, jockey silks and starting gates while the stream of horses continued to head for the quaint track 180 miles to the north. This will be the 132nd season of racing at Saratoga, an annual stay in the country where world-class horses gather for 35 stakes worth $8.7 million over the 36 racing days through Labor Day, Sept. 4. Then it's back to Belmont Park on Friday, Sept. 8.</p>
        <p>Nobody needed any reminders that Saratoga is good business as well as good sport. But the final figures for the 55-day season at Belmont showed a drop of about 5 percent in attendance to an average of 8,520 spectators a day, a loss of 5.5 percent in the on-track betting handle to just over $1 million a day and a loss of 6.6 percent in total handle to $1.9 million a day.</p>
        <p>The key to the equation was the lack of a Triple Crown showdown in the Belmont Stakes, said Terry Meyocks, the president of the New York Racing Association, which runs the tracks at Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga. In the previous three years, the Belmont Stakes offered grand theater: the Triple Crown was on the line, but each time the horse who had won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness lost by a few yards or less before crowds that rose to 85,000.</p>
        <p>This year the scenario was different. Fusaichi Pegasus won the Derby, Red Bullet won the Preakness and neither ran in the Belmont, which was won by the long shot Commendable before 67,818 people.</p>
        <p>''We were extremely pleased with the Belmont Stakes,'' Meyocks said, ''when we were able to set a record for a non-Triple Crown Belmont with almost 68,000 people on hand. When you look inside the numbers, though, you can see where and why the numbers for the meet came up short.</p>
        <p>''While we were short approximately 24,500 people for the meet, 18,000 of that was on Belmont Stakes day. We are fully aware that a Triple Crown is not going to be on the line most years. But when you compare against the power of that Triple Crown attraction, you are sure to come up short.''</p>
        <p>The totals for the meet, which began in mid-May, showed attendance at 468,618, on-track handle at $106 million and total handle from other tracks tied in by simulcasting, down to $581 million.</p>
        <p>The leading jockey at Belmont Park, although he missed a week while contending with kidney stones, was Jerry Bailey with 65 victories, followed by Jorge Chavez with 56 and Edgar Prado with 46. The leading trainer was Bill Mott with 21 victories, followed by Todd Pletcher (19), Shug McGaughey (16) and Phil Johnson (15).</p>
        <p>Saratoga, which draws large numbers of tourists and vacationers, averaged about 25,000 people a day last year, three times the average for Belmont Park. The upstate stakes season opens with the Schuylerville, the first of six stakes for 2-year-olds starting their careers at the most important country track in racing.</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>JERRY BAILEY fired a final salute when he guided Gander to a two-length victory in the Evan Shipman Handicap for horses foaled in New York State. It was the last stake of the season at Belmont, and Gander outran Shut Out Time with Not So Fast running third. The winner, trained by JOHN TERRANOVA, completed the mile and one-sixteenth in 1:42, paid $6.60 for a $2 bet to win and earned $49,230.</p>
