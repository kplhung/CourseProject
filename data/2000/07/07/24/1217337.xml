        <p>Letter from Mary T Zdanowicz (Treatment Advocacy Center) backs July 17 editorial calling on New York City to provide care for released jail inmates with severe mental illness</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You correctly hold New York City accountable for treating people with severe mental illness who are released from its jails (editorial, July 17).</p>
        <p>Incredibly, Rikers Island is now de facto the state's largest inpatient psychiatric facility, housing more people with severe mental illnesses than any of New York's psychiatric hospitals. Until the state starts targeting the use of its significant mental health budget to care for the most seriously ill, New Yorkers will continue to be imprisoned because of their psychosis rather than receive treatment for it.</p>

        <p>Coupling the state's progressive Kendra's Law with the new court-mandated services for those released from jail will ensure that this population gets the treatment it needs. Using Kendra's Law for people who qualify for it before they get into trouble will keep them from entering the revolving door at Rikers.</p>
