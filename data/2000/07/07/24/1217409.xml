        <p>Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, has been a remarkably sure-footed politician.

        <p>Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, has been a remarkably sure-footed politician. But a recent succession of miscues has dented his popularity and thrown his government onto the defensive. To recover before next year's likely election, he will have to show his government can deliver effective policies as well as carefully crafted imagery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair brought his Labor Party back to power in 1997 by ditching traditional leftist positions and appealing to centrists, the same way Bill Clinton recaptured the White House for the Democrats in 1992. Since then, Mr. Blair has enjoyed some of the highest popularity ratings of any postwar prime minister. But his extended honeymoon seems to have come to an end. Polls show Labor's consistent 20-point lead over the opposition Conservatives has dropped to single digits.</p>
        <p>This month the Blair government suffered acute embarrassment through the leak of two internal memos. One, written by Mr. Blair in April, complained that the government was seen as losing touch with the general public on social issues like crime, the family and patriotism. He called for a series of ''eye-catching initiatives'' personally associating himself with these issues. The second, drafted by the government's pollster, Philip Gould, portrayed Labor as adrift, its focus and strength ebbing monthly. The disclosure of these two memos left the impression of a government obsessed with its own image and short-term publicity gimmicks rather than long-term policies.</p>
        <p>The unfavorable publicity came just as Labor was announcing a $65 billion three-year spending package to repair Britain's frayed social services and infrastructure. The fiscal conservatism of Labor's first three years produced a sizable surplus that the government now plans to spend on better education, transportation and policing. A big boost in health care spending was announced earlier this year. There are also increases for university scientific research and foreign aid. The package identifies most of the right priorities and finances them generously.</p>
        <p>Labor still has a good chance of winning the next elections. But for that to happen, Mr. Blair needs to shift his attention from image management to making sure his government spends the new money wisely and effectively.</p>
