        <p>A Beckett Rarity</p>
        <p>New York gets a Samuel Beckett premiere at 8 tonight, when the curtain goes up on a stage version of that Nobel Prize winner's only television play, ''Eh Joe.'' First seen on the BBC in 1966, it was written for two actors: a man and an unseen woman, his recently deceased companion, who speaks from beyond the grave. Beginning with the highlights of their relationship, the drama descends into bitterness as she compels him to relive an infidelity that led to her suicide. The new production, directed by Cradeaux Alexander at the Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street in the East Village, will have five actors portraying Joe's loves and family members. Information: (212) 777-6088.</p>
        <p>Master of Arts</p>
        <p>Scarcely a household name in the West, Hon'ami Koetsu (1558-1637) is the only artist whose works in two different mediums, lacquer and ceramics, have been designated National Treasures by the Japanese government. Never previously celebrated in a comprehensive exhibition outside Japan, he will be the subject of a show of more than 100 objects from collections in Japan, Europe and the United States, beginning on Saturday at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. ''The Arts of Hon'ami Koetsu, Japanese Renaissance Master'' continues through Oct. 29. Information: (215) 763-8100.</p>
        <p>Music al Fresco</p>
        <p>How does this sound? A beautiful park. A starry (one hopes) night. A great orchestra. Music by Glinka (''Ruslan and Ludmilla'' Overture), Corigliano (''Elegy''), Copland (Four Dance Episodes from ''Rodeo'') and Shostakovich (Symphony No. 5). That's the outlook at 8 tonight when the 36th season of the New York Philharmonic's concerts in the parks, sponsored by Time Warner, begins on the Great Lawn of Central Park. This week Andre Raphel Smith will also conduct on Thursday in Cunningham Park, Queens; on Friday at Miller Field in the Gateway National Recreation Area on Staten Island; and on Saturday in Heckscher State Park in East Islip on Long Island. Next week Mikko Franck will lead works by Bernstein, Gershwin, Arutunian and Stravinsky on Aug. 1 in Central Park; on Aug. 2 in Prospect Park, Brooklyn; on Aug. 3 in Van Cortlandt Park, the Bronx; and on Aug. 5 at Westchester Community College in Valhalla. Information: (212) 875-5709.</p>
