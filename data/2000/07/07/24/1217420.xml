        <p>Several men who were turned away from a private party at a Queens restaurant early yesterday morning returned in a fit of anger  and began shooting at a group outside, injuring four people, the police said.</p>
        <p>The shooting began at 3:30 a.m. outside the Porterhouse Grill at 193rd Street and Union Turnpike in Fresh Meadows, where the men had been denied entry, said Sgt. Gerry Falcon, a police spokeswoman. At least three of the men had handguns, the police said, and more than 25 rounds were fired into the crowd.</p>
        <p>The police identified the injured as Carlos Mendez, 25, who was shot twice in the thigh; Thomas Davis, 26, who was hit once in the arm; Dawn Scott, 25, who was shot in both legs and in the stomach; and Jermaine Futrell, 22, who was hit in the leg. All  were in stable condition at area hospitals yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Police officers from the 107th Precinct arrested two Queens men at the scene, Anwar Griffin, 17, of 117-15 195th Street, and Luis Koonce, 21, of 190-05 Linden Boulevard. They were charged with attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>
        <p>A third man, Shawn Anderson, 22, of 89-30 187th Place, faced the same charges after the police arrested him at Queens General Hospital. Sergeant Falcon said Mr. Anderson had escaped from the scene with another man in a van, but he had been shot in the hand outside the restaurant and had later taken a taxicab to the hospital so he could be treated.</p>
        <p>The other man in the van had not been arrested as of last night.</p>
