        <p>Is the horror writer Stephen King leading a revolution in the way books are published, or just exploring the power of celebrity in the digital age?</p>
        <p>His latest thriller, entitled ''The Plant,'' describes a vicious vine that terrorizes a small publishing house, extorting human sacrifices. To some in the book business, the image is apt, because with the ''The Plant'' Mr. King plans to become today the first major author to self-publish on the Internet. He will offer the new book to fans in electronic installments available for downloading from his site, www.stephen king.com.</p>
        <p>The launch has touched off a debate over whether the Web can liberate authors from their dependence on publishers, or just make it easier for truly famous people to rally their fans.</p>
        <p>''The Plant'' may not make history with literary critics, but Mr. King, who is fast becoming the public face of electronic publishing, feels he stands at a crossroads in the history of books.</p>
        <p>''I have a sense of being in a place and time where I might actually make a difference in how people view the Web,'' he said in an interview. ''There is a possibility of opening up an area of publishing that won't be touched by the major publishers -- not necessarily for John Grisham or Tom Clancy, because they don't need to do this, but this might be a way for a lot of other writers to publish.''</p>
        <p>Mr. King says he hopes to advance the cause of online publishing by whetting readers' appetite for electronic books. ''If you develop a taste for anchovies on pizza -- that's me, the pizza -- then you might start looking around for other foods with anchovies,'' he says, referring to other digital works.</p>
        <p>Publishers and authors will be watching closely. In March, Mr. King shocked the major publishers into jump-starting their digital book efforts when, at his behest, Simon &amp; Schuster published his novella ''Riding the Bullet'' in electronic form. More than 400,000 eager fans logged on to download it as soon as it debuted.</p>
        <p>Since then, all the major publishers have beefed up their output of electronic books, from distributing texts over the Internet to setting up print-on-demand service for low-selling titles.</p>
        <p>Mr. King's decision to publish himself comes as a disappointment to Simon &amp; Schuster. Mr. King is one of the industry's best-selling authors, and to win the right to publish his novels, the house agreed to an unprecedented profit-sharing partnership with Mr. King instead of the traditional royalty-advance contract. But Jack Romanos, Simon &amp; Schuster's president and chief operating officer, said the house supported his new venture, and even offered to help. ''At Simon &amp; Schuster, Stephen King rules, to borrow from the MTV lingo,'' he said. ''Because he rules, he frequently can make the rules.''</p>
        <p>Mr. King is not the only author to toy with self-publishing over the Web. Authors frequently grouse about their conventional publishers, usually bemoaning the quality of the editing, the amount of publicity, or the size of their paychecks. Some authors now hire their own editors and publicists. Plenty of companies already offer the rest of the services publishers provide -- from book design to printing and distribution.</p>
        <p>But even for authors who did not need advances, a publisher's marketing and publicity clout were always irreplaceable, especially in winning over booksellers. Now some say the advent of the Web may change that.</p>
        <p>Last week, Seth Godin, a former Yahoo marketing executive and a former Simon &amp; Schuster author, self-published his book, ''Unleashing the Idea Virus'' after turning down an advance. He persuaded the online booksellers BarnesandNoble.com and Amazon.com to distribute electronic editions for free to anyone who cared to download it, and reaped a bonanza of publicity from the stunt.</p>
        <p>The pass-around dynamic of Web publishing will create demand the way radio generates demand for new songs, he says, and he hopes people will buy the physical books as ''souvenirs of the idea.''</p>
        <p>Instead of selling the rights to a publisher, he paid a book packager $40,000 to edit his manuscript and turn it into a hardcover book for release in September. He will pay about $4 a copy for printing and distribution, shipping only to the two online bookstores, and keep the remainder of the sales revenue for himself. He plans to sell hardcover copies for the unusually high wholesale price of about $20, which means he will earn about $16 a copy and cover his initial costs after selling roughly 3,000 copies. His previous book sold 100,000 copies in hardcover at a typical wholesale price of about $12, earning him about $300,000 in royalties.</p>
        <p>''This model is significantly more profitable for an author,'' Mr. Godin said, which, he believes, is bad news for publishers. On one hand, ''slush pile'' authors who haven't yet published will offer their work online because it is cheap and easy. On the other hand, successful authors with enough fame, prestige or gimmickry to market their own books will find online self-publishing more lucrative than receiving royalties.</p>
        <p>''All that is left for publishers is the authors in the unwashed middle, which is the least profitable part of publishing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Simon &amp; Schuster's Mr. Romanos predicted that few other authors would follow Mr. King's lead. ''The average writer is really more interested in writing than the transaction part of the process,'' he said. What's more, he says, big publishers' economies of scale allow them to do business more cheaply and effectively than authors could by paying editors, printers and everyone else. Publishers often pass along much of the savings to authors, at least to their marquee names, like Mr. King.</p>
        <p>David Card, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, says Mr. King's self-publication resembles the efforts of other celebrities to talk or sell directly to their fans, as musicians like Prince and Courtney Love have done on their Web sites. O. J. Simpson is starting a Web site where he will sell memorabilia and, for a fee, he will answer questions from the public. Still, Mr. Card says, most writers' and performers' time is better spent doing what made them famous.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most innovative aspect of Mr. King's plans for ''The Plant'' is his novel honor-system payment plan. Mr. King is trusting his readers to send him a dollar after each download, instead of requiring them to pay beforehand as Simon &amp; Schuster did to sell his previous electronic book. ''No stealing from the blind newsboy!'' he admonishes on his Web site.</p>
        <p>To encourage payment, Mr. King has his own security device: suspense. If he does not receive payments for at least 75 percent of the downloads, he says, he will stop writing after two chapters, and readers won't learn the end.</p>
        <p>''If you don't pay me, I will put my guitar over my shoulder and head on down the road,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Many readers have already posted on his Web site offers to pay much more than a dollar a chapter in order to see him finish the work. If he asked, he says, many of his die-hard fans would mail him money even if there wasn't a new book.</p>
        <p>Mr. King says ''The Plant'' may extend for nearly 10 installments. ''Theoretically, I could make a fortune,'' he says, noting that he made $130,000 from his last electronic book for a story that might have earned him $15,000 from a magazine. But he insists that isn't his motive. Amazon.com eagerly signed on to collect payments from readers for him.</p>
        <p>James Gleick, a science writer who considered and rejected the idea of self-publishing over the Internet, says the pay-later plan is the most promising aspect of Mr. King's latest publication. ''You want to take advantage of the ability of online stuff to spread around -- you want people to be able to pass your book around and e-mail it to their friends,'' he says. The honor system may not be widely practicable, but publishers and encryption companies are working on technology to let consumers read some of a book first and then pay to finish and keep it.</p>
        <p>Mr. King hastens to say that he has nothing against traditional publishers. He even intends to publish a paper version of ''The Plant'' with Simon &amp; Schuster.</p>
        <p>But his Web site might spook some in the business. ''My friends, we have a chance to become Big Publishing's worst nightmare,'' writes Mr. King.</p>
        <p>And he is an expert in nightmares.</p>
