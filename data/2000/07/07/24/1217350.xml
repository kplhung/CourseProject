        <p>Silicon Valley entrepreneurs fall into two categories, John Doerr, the Valley's most prominent venture capitalist, told a group of Internet executives last week. There are the missionaries, he said, and there are the mercenaries.</p>
        <p>''Missionaries obsess on the customer,'' explained Mr. Doerr, a partner in Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers. By way of an example, he offered Jeff Bezos, the somewhat embattled chief executive of Amazon.com, a Kleiner investment.</p>
        <p>''Mercenaries,'' he continued, ''obsess on compensation.'' His example was an executive who has founded several Kleiner-backed companies, Jim Clark.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark, in fact, had just an hour earlier astounded the 800 executives at the $4,200-a-head Internet Summit sponsored by The Industry Standard magazine by saying he opposed the government's plan to break Microsoft up. Mr. Clark, of course, is the founder of Netscape Communications, who played a role in convincing the Justice Department to bring the antitrust suit in the first place.</p>
        <p>But since Microsoft had won the browser software war, Mr. Clark told the audience, he had purchased a million shares in the company. ''Since I own the stock,'' he said, ''I'd rather see Microsoft stay together.''</p>
        <p>What Mr. Clark did not tell the audience is where he got the money to buy the Microsoft shares: Earlier this year, he sold the entire stash of America Online shares that he had received when that company bought Netscape last year. AOL's subsequent deal to buy Time Warner turned him off, he explained in an interview. He argues that that content producers, like magazines and cable networks, should be separate from distribution systems like AOL's online service.</p>
        <p>Most of the AOL stock proceeds, he said, are still in cash. But in addition to Microsoft, Mr. Clark said, he has also bought a big stake in Amazon. Still, it is not clear that Mr. Clark is as enamored as Mr. Doerr with companies run by missionaries. ''So far I've lost $40 million on Amazon,'' he said.</p>

        <p>COMPRESSED DATA  Correction:  August 9, 2000, Wednesday  A report in the Compressed Data column of Business Day on July 24 about an announcement by the technology entrepreneur James H. Clark that he had bought a million shares of Microsoft stock referred imprecisely to a comment made about him later, at the same industry conference, by the venture capitalist John Doerr. Mr. Doerr's speech described two categories of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs -- missionaries and mercenaries. It was in response to a question from the moderator that Mr. Doerr said Mr. Clark would probably consider himself a mercenary; Mr. Doerr did not characterize Mr. Clark that way unprompted.</p>
