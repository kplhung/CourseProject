        <p>To Gail Berman the cultural chasm is not especially wide between serious plays like Athol Fugard's ''Blood Knot'' or David Rabe's ''Hurlyburly'' and television shows like ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Malcolm in the Middle.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Berman produced all of them.</p>
        <p>''Producing is producing, whether you're on Broadway or television,'' said Ms. Berman, the new president for entertainment at the Fox Broadcasting Company. ''You have to remember who your consumer is in the theater, just as you do on television. You have to be wrapped up and emotionally engaged in what you're doing. And in both cases you have a company of actors, and you're living through the issues and problems and highs and lows of that group of people for months and months and months.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Berman is nonetheless an anomaly in the television business: an executive with a taste for the offbeat who is rooted in the New York theater.</p>
        <p>Her appointment to her new job, by Sandy Grushow, chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment Group, came at a significant moment for a network that once monopolized the teenage and young-adult audiences. Hugely successful Fox shows like ''The X Files'' are aging, and signature shows like ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' ''Melrose Place'' and ''Party of Five'' are no longer on the air. Last season saw a run of new shows flop in succession: ''Action,'' ''Time of Your Life,'' ''Family Guy,'' ''Ryan Caulfield,'' ''Harsh Realm'' and ''Get Real.''</p>
        <p>In appointing Ms. Berman, Fox was clearly seeking to revive the network's formula of luring mainstream audiences with offbeat shows. Ms. Berman was formerly president of Regency Television, the studio that created ''Malcolm.''</p>
        <p>''The network has only succeeded when it has done genuinely interesting and exciting things,'' Mr. Grushow said. ''And Gail will figure out how to make original and distinctive programming.'</p>
        <p>But Ms. Berman's sensibilities do not seem in tune with the kinds of shows that Fox has often presented. Although the network, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, has promised to eschew ''exploitative specials,'' Fox is still known for the kind of downscale shows that are not seen on other networks. In recent years its specials have ranged from ''Ghosts, Fact or Fiction'' and ''Paranormal: Do You Believe?'' to ''When Good Pets Go Bad'' and ''World's Wildest Police Videos'' and ''World's Scariest Police Shootouts.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Berman said one of the network's problems was an executive suite revolving door. Her predecessor, Doug Herzog, had been in the job only 16 months. His predecessors had also been relatively short-lived, mostly because of internal tensions, ratings problems and the demands of the two men running News Corporation, Mr. Murdoch and Peter Chernin.</p>
        <p>Even in the face of this volatility it seems unlikely to her friends and associates that Ms. Berman will pull her punches. ''Gail is forthright,'' said Linwood Boomer, the creator of the semi-autobiographical ''Malcolm in the Middle,'' which is about a brilliant young boy and his affectionately wacky family. ''She's not one of those executives who say, 'I don't know what to think until one of my bosses tell me.' She's not afraid of alienating someone.''</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Berman is not the usual brash television hot shot in her 20's or 30's. She is a 43-year-old mother of 7-year-old twins, boy and girl, who lives a relatively quiet life in the Pacific Palisades with her husband, Bill Masters, a television writer and producer. She grew up in Bellmore, on Long Island, and in the Philadelphia suburbs and attended the University of Maryland, where she was a theater major. Shortly after graduating in 1978, Ms. Berman and a college classmate, Susan Rose, saw an early production of ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' at Catholic University, in Olney, Md.</p>
        <p>''In a Mickey-and-Judy sort of way, we decided we would like to take that production to Ford's Theater in Washington,'' she said with a laugh. ''We were incredibly naive.''</p>
        <p>What followed, she said, were phone calls, sometimes three times a day, to the New York offices of Robert Stigwood, the show's producer. A sympathetic assistant to Mr. Stigwood led the young women to David Land, a top executive of the Stigwood organization in London. ''He was an elderly gentleman who, I think, was kind of amused by these two girls,'' Ms. Berman said. ''We got the rights to the show at Ford's Theater. And then we raised money for it like Girl Scouts selling cookies.'' The two women were helped financially by Melvyn J. Estrin, a Washington businessman, who also invested in their later productions.</p>
        <p>The show, which was set for a six-week run, lasted nine months. With the help of the producer Zev Bufman they brought the production to New York, where it ran for two months Off Broadway and for two and a half years on Broadway at the Royale Theater.</p>
        <p>It was followed by an instant flop, ''Almost an Eagle,'' with James Whitmore, but the women hung in and went on to produce ''Hurlyburly,'' with William Hurt, Christopher Walken, Harvey Keitel, Judith Ivey, Cynthia Nixon, Sigourney Weaver and Jerry Stiller and ''Blood Knot.'' Ms. Berman was then one of the producers of Larry Shue's moderately successful ''Nerd.''</p>
        <p>By the late 1980's, ''I sort of felt that I had spent my youth sitting in people's living rooms raising money,'' she said. ''But it was scary giving up.''</p>
        <p>It was then that she got a phone call from executives at HBO, who were beginning a comedy channel.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know anything about television,'' she said. ''I didn't know what I was doing. But I did know how to read a script. I did know how to work with writers. I did know how to work with production people. And what I learned eventually was that producing is the same, in whatever medium. ''</p>
        <p>With her husband working in Los Angeles, Ms. Berman moved there in 1990 and got a job working in the television division of Sandollar, the management and production company owned by Sandy Gallin and Dolly Parton. Six and a half years later she became a partner in the company and was also executive producer of the highly successful ''Buffy'' and its spinoff, ''Angel,'' on the WB Network.</p>
        <p>At Fox Ms. Berman has brought in a new team of executives to deal with scheduling, marketing and ''long-form'' shows, or movies. Several executives have since been replaced. She has announced plans for a hip-hop version of ''The Wizard of Oz'' and a drama, ''World War III,'' which will star Timothy Hutton and Vanessa Williams.</p>
        <p>The hip-hip ''Wizard'' was, she said, essentially a statement that Fox was intent on doing what she called ''quality event programming'' that would appeal to a broad range of 28- to 49-year-olds. Fox has shied away from the 90-minute or two-hour dramas, musicals or extravaganzas that other networks periodically present. ''It's right up my alley from my theater background,'' Ms. Berman said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berman said that the success of ''Malcolm in the Middle'' also provided a lesson that resonated with her theater background and that will help shape programming. Too often, she said, series are created by committee or with the heavy interference of executives. ''Malcolm'' was the product of Mr. Boomer, who created a distinctive work.</p>
        <p>''To have a writer's singular vision is everything,'' Ms. Berman said. The family in the show, she added, struck a chord among viewers who seem to identify with it. ''Everything isn't tied into a neat bow. But they're doing their best. They're working hard. And the parents love each other and love their children. It's a pretty accurate description of many families.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile there is the wave of ''reality programming'' to contend with.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to get ahead of the curve and not just do something in the wake of 'Survivor' and 'Big Brother,' '' she said. ''We have to come up with new and better and original stuff and not just try to catch up.''</p>
        <p>In many ways Fox was the home for precursors to these shows. ''Frankly our highest-rated show last week was 'Cops,' '' she said, pointing to the long-running series that features videos of police officers hunting down crime suspects. That show, as well as ''America's Most Wanted,'' has made Saturday one of the network's strongest nights.</p>
        <p>This might seem a long way from Broadway, but Ms. Berman said she planned to return one day to New York to produce theater again. ''As difficult as it was, I was living my fantasy doing it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Which is not to say she hasn't found a home in her new world. ''There are things you can do on television that you can't do anywhere else,'' she said.</p>
