        <p>Trades and non-trades haunted the Mets today. This morning, General Manager Steve Phillips acknowledged that the Cincinnati Reds' Barry Larkin had turned down a deal to the Mets.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, as the Mets lounged in their Turner Field clubhouse, some of them watched on television as the All-Star Jason Isringhausen -- who was traded by the Mets last July -- closed out a victory for Oakland.</p>
        <p>And tonight, the Mets were beaten, 1-0, by the Atlanta Braves, who got a magnificent pitching performance from Andy Ashby, just over in a trade from the Philadelphia Phillies.</p>
        <p>Ashby threw a complete game in shutting out the Mets on four hits. The Braves took two of the three games from the Mets this weekend and increased their lead in the National League East to six games.</p>
        <p>''The strike zone was pretty fair for him tonight,'' Mets outfielder Jay Payton said of Ashby. ''He got a few calls, and he took advantage of it. He was going down and away for strikes, and he kept throwing it there. You tip your hat -- he took advantage of the situation and he pitched a great game.''</p>
        <p>The Mets right-hander Bobby J. Jones did not pitch as well, allowing seven hits and a run in five and one-third innings, his shortest outing since returning from Class AAA Norfolk. But he spotted his fastball well to get out of several jams, and in seven starts since coming back, Jones has a 3.25 earned run average.</p>
        <p>''I think he's back as a really credible starter who can pitch in the big game, pitch in the major league game and give us a chance to win,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''This is a tough lineup, and he gave us an excellent chance to win.''</p>
        <p>Jones got an assist from Derek Bell in the fifth. With two runners on and two outs, Chipper Jones lofted a high fly to right. Bell drifted back, timed his leap and stretched his arm over the fence for the catch. Beaming, Bell held his glove high for several seconds as he skipped in from right field.</p>
        <p>''I was stunned,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>Bell is getting more chances for highlight-reel plays than he did the past several years with the Houston Astros, whose staff did not have as many pitchers who induced fly balls to right field. ''I'm playing on grass, I've been feeling better, I'm running better,'' Bell said. ''I've got a point to prove that I am a good defensive player, and I'm trying to help the young guys and lead by example.''</p>
        <p>Bell's catch stopped the Braves' charge for only a moment. Brian Jordan singled to lead off the sixth and scored when Wally Joyner doubled down the right-field line. After a groundout and an intentional walk put runners at the corners, Dennis Cook came in to retire Keith Lockhart and Ashby to hold the score at 1-0.</p>
        <p>The Mets' best chance came in the fourth, when Payton doubled off the top of the wall in left. Bell was on first but did not have a chance to score when the ball caromed right back to left fielder Bobby Bonilla. After Mike Piazza walked, Todd Zeile grounded into an inning-ending double play.</p>
        <p>Ashby put his shutout in jeopardy in the ninth, when he overthrew first base after a comebacker by Payton, who reached second. But Piazza grounded out, Zeile lined out after fouling off four pitches with two strikes and Benny Agbayani -- whose potential game-tying double fell just foul down the right-field line -- grounded out to end the game.</p>
        <p>The Mets spoke to the Phillies about Ashby, who had pitched poorly and complained of being booed in Philadelphia, raising questions about his toughness. Bringing Ashby to New York might have been a bad fit, but even if the Mets had aggressively pursued him, they had no young, major league-ready pitcher they could spare in the deal, as the Braves did when they traded Bruce Chen to the Phillies.</p>
        <p>Comfortable in Atlanta, Ashby is 2-0 with a pair of complete games.</p>
        <p>''I had a rough start just like he did,'' Jones said. ''Looking at the numbers, people aren't going to expect a 1-0 game. But it's part of battling through your hard times.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Afternoon rain at Turner Field kept second baseman EDGARDO ALFONZO from testing his sore right hip before Sunday night's game. If he had been able to, he said, he might have been in the Mets' starting lineup. The Mets are off on Monday, and Alfonzo is likely to be back in the lineup on Tuesday. ''The last two days, I was walking with pain,'' he said. ''But I was walking and I rode the bike today, and it was fine.''</p>
