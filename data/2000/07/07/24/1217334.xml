        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It was heartening to read Bob Herbert's July 20 column about a recent study by economists confirming what common sense and intuition suggest -- that there is a strong link between unemployment and the crime rate.</p>
        <p>Employment can significantly reduce ex-offenders' chances of being reincarcerated, but they face numerous barriers to obtaining employment. Many are poorly educated and lack job skills and strong employment histories, and many face illegal job discrimination after revealing a criminal record.</p>

        <p>It was heartening to read Bob Herbert's July 20 column about a recent study by economists confirming what common sense and intuition suggest -- that there is a strong link between unemployment and the crime rate.</p>
        <p>Employment can significantly reduce ex-offenders' chances of being reincarcerated, but they face numerous barriers to obtaining employment. Many are poorly educated and lack job skills and strong employment histories, and many face illegal job discrimination after revealing a criminal record.</p>
        <p>There are not enough prison and community-based programs that specialize in providing ex-offenders with education, job training and placement services. Given the correlation between employment and reduced crime, we should do more to promote the hiring of people with criminal records.</p>
