        <p>A BLIND MAN CAN SEE HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU  By Amy Bloom.  163 pages. Random House. $22.95.</p>
        <p>Exotic intimacies color the sharply wrought stories in Amy Bloom's fine new collection. And they reveal themselves hauntingly as these tales unfold. For instance, in the title selection the closeness of a mother named Jane and a child named Jessie is the starting point for an unusual journey, since it turns out that Jessie's visit to a gender-reassignment surgeon is the story's galvanizing event. Jessie is about to become Jess. Her mother is about to strike up a heterosexual liaison that, in the context of this story's sense of mutable sexual identity, seems far more peculiar than what Jessie/Jess is going through.</p>
        <p>In a set of stories whose characters find themselves bridging various chasms -- medical, sexual, racial -- and casually breaking assorted taboos, Ms. Bloom writes warmly and astutely, with arresting precision, about the various adjustments that they make. So we learn in ''A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You,'' with the unconditional acceptance inherent in its title, that Jessie and Jane were always close, even when the mother had not yet fully acknowledged her child's anomalous sexual nature.</p>

        <p>A BLIND MAN CAN SEE HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU  By Amy Bloom.  163 pages. Random House. $22.95.</p>
        <p>Exotic intimacies color the sharply wrought stories in Amy Bloom's fine new collection. And they reveal themselves hauntingly as these tales unfold. For instance, in the title selection the closeness of a mother named Jane and a child named Jessie is the starting point for an unusual journey, since it turns out that Jessie's visit to a gender-reassignment surgeon is the story's galvanizing event. Jessie is about to become Jess. Her mother is about to strike up a heterosexual liaison that, in the context of this story's sense of mutable sexual identity, seems far more peculiar than what Jessie/Jess is going through.</p>
        <p>In a set of stories whose characters find themselves bridging various chasms -- medical, sexual, racial -- and casually breaking assorted taboos, Ms. Bloom writes warmly and astutely, with arresting precision, about the various adjustments that they make. So we learn in ''A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You,'' with the unconditional acceptance inherent in its title, that Jessie and Jane were always close, even when the mother had not yet fully acknowledged her child's anomalous sexual nature.</p>
        <p>Thus, when young Jessie rejected a dress for a wedding and insisted on a boy's navy blazer with gray pants, ''Jane knew that she had managed not to see it, as you manage not to see that your neighbor's new baby has your husband's eyes and nose.'' But it is clear from the story's first sentence (''Jane Spencer collects pictures of slim young men'') that the mother will follow her child anywhere, even to a parents' support group where one father is a general trying hard to understand his former son:</p>
        <p>''Loved that boy, fed him a hot breakfast at 4 a.m., drove him to tae kwon do tournaments all over Minnesota and then all over the Midwest. They flew to competitions in Los Angeles for 10 and 11, to Boston for under 13, then to the National Juniors Competitions, and there are 300 trophies in their house. That boy is now swinging one small-ankled foot, dangling a pink high-heeled sandal off it and modeling himself not on Mia Hamm or Sally Ride or even Lindsay Davenport . . . but on Malibu Barbie. And the general has to love this girl as he loved that boy, or be without.''</p>
        <p>By this point in the story Jane herself is so immersed in Jess's experience that she thinks potential transsexuals might be everywhere if the surgery were easy enough, ''and they might be considered no worse than Roseanne or Burt Reynolds.'' So when she meets a man named Cole, whose hands are the same size as hers and who refers to his ''soon-to-be ex-wife,'' she finds herself ''trying to figure out whether he means 'wife' in the sense of 'woman I am married to,' or 'wife' in the sense of 'man in my life who played a kind of wifely role.' ''</p>
        <p>The story ends with each character poised expectantly on the brink of change and the wonderfully apt memory of Joe E. Brown, in ''Some Like It Hot,'' ''crowing with delight, clutching his straw boater and Jack Lemmon as the speedboat carries them off to a cockeyed and irresistible future.''</p>
        <p>Other stories here also hinge on unusual alliances and often on a strong sense of foreboding. In ''Rowing to Eden,'' Ms. Bloom presents the temporary menage a trois of Mai, who is undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer; Ellie, Mai's lesbian best friend, who has herself already had a mastectomy; and Charley, Mai's husband, who plays host to the group on Fishers Island and is trying hard -- in Mai's view, too hard -- to maintain good cheer in the face of Mai's ordeal.</p>
        <p>In her own mind Mai ''had been walking down a sunny street, minding her own business, doing no harm, when something sank its teeth into her breast, gnawed it from her body, stripped her skin off with its great claw and dangled her, hairless head first, over a great invisible chasm while poor Charley stood on the other side, mistaking everything he saw and heard for something that had to do with him.''</p>
        <p>This situation holds obvious potential for anger and sorrow. Yet Ms. Bloom imbues it with wisdom and tenderness until Ellie and Charley reach an unexpectedly visceral accommodation in the shadow of Mai's decline.</p>
        <p>Similarly she writes of Lionel and Julia in two consecutive stories, ''Night Vision'' and ''Light Into Dark,'' with an almost matter-of-fact acceptance of their tricky situation. Julia is 21 years older than Lionel; she is white, he is black, and years ago they once slept together. That she is the stepmother he calls Ma, and that both were in shock over the death of Lionel's father when they drifted into incest, are matters of ancient history as Ms. Bloom tells the story. The question now, in a tale rich with cannily observed unease and redolent of the smell of cornbread, is how they will get through Thanksgiving dinner.</p>
        <p>The collection's last and most atypically bitter tale, ''The Story,'' finds Ms. Bloom overtly manipulating the process of creating fiction as she first presents a pleasantly sanitized version of how a Connecticut accountant works her way into the lives of the golden-looking couple next door. Able to stand this only so long, her narrator then abruptly drops the niceties and tells how she hated the wife, coveted the husband and stopped at nothing to get what she wanted. The end of this particularly piercing story finds the author speaking, in a sense, for all the unconventional liaisons she has described. As her narrator puts it, ''I have made it as the world should be and not as I have found it.''</p>
