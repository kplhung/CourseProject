        <p>Lance Armstrong made it official today, winning his second consecutive Tour de France as easily as he did his first. This victory pleased him more, he said, since he viewed it as confirmation of his talent, proof that the first triumph was not a fluke, as he thought was implied by some rivals who were absent then.</p>
        <p>''Everybody's here, the critical ones were here,'' Armstrong said today before the last of 21 daily stages. ''Everybody was on the start line'' July 1, when the 87th Tour began.</p>
        <p>''I didn't answer their criticism last year, but I heard it, thought about it,'' he said. ''If I did answer it, I answered it simply, subtly. I said: 'They'll see. We'll see.' ''</p>
        <p>Channeling his anger, Armstrong, the 28-year-old leader of the U.S. Postal Service team, crushed his rivals in the first major individual test on July 10, the Hautacam climb in the Pyrenees. ''It was full-on,'' Armstrong says now, ''full-on aggression.'' And he remained virtually untouchable thereafter in a 6-minute-2-second victory as lucid and inevitable as a Bach suite.</p>
        <p>Today, the traditional mass sprint that closes the race was won by Stefano Zanini, an Italian with the Mapei team, who is usually the pacesetter for Mapei's top sprinter, Tom Steels. But Steels dropped out of the Tour two weeks ago after scoring two victories, so Zanini was free to ride for himself today.</p>
        <p>He finished half a wheel ahead of Erik Zabel, a German with Telekom, who ended a three-year victory drought on Saturday. Third was Roman Vainsteins, a Latvian with Vini Caldirola. They and nearly all the rest of the 128-man field finished the 87-mile 21st stage in 3 hours 12 minutes 36 seconds. Robbie McEwen, an Australian with Farm Frites, who won in Paris last year, was eighth this time.</p>
        <p>Armstrong rode serenely in the pack to record his second successive Tour victory, the second American to repeat as champion since Greg LeMond won the race in 1989 and 1990.</p>
        <p>Armstrong saw the sights of Paris on his way to the top step on the victory podium. There was the Eiffel Tower as the starting point for the first time, followed by such tourist spots as the Louvre, the Place de la Bastille, the new Opera, the Hotel de Ville, or city hall, and finally 12 passages along the broad Champs-Elysees.</p>
        <p>Surrounded by his teammates and easy to notice because of his yellow jersey as the race's leader, Armstrong crossed the final line in a discreet 76th place. He finished the 3,660-kilometer (2,774-mile) race, generally considered the toughest endurance event in sports, in a total of 92:33:08.</p>
        <p>So Armstrong remains No. 1, four years after a diagnosis of testicular cancer, which had spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain and which needed three months of chemotherapy and a year off from the sport to arrest.</p>
        <p>Like his first victory, this one was marked by panache, the flair that Bernard Hinault, five times a winner of the Tour, has described as ''the cherry on top of the cake.'' Last year, Armstrong won a long time trial and the first stage in the Alps back to back. This year, he generously allowed a major foe, Marco Pantani of Italy, to pass him at the finish line for victory in the climb of Mont Ventoux.</p>
        <p>The gesture worked out badly. The Italian climber, whom Armstrong regards as one of those absentees from last year who did not respect his victory, said after the Ventoux climb that he did not need any help to win and that indeed he had received none.</p>
        <p>''I regret Mont Ventoux,'' Armstrong said Saturday. ''I felt I was the strongest rider there, but I also respected him then and thought he deserved the honor of winning a monument. I still respect him as an athlete, a rider, a climber. He's the best.</p>
        <p>''But if I'm in a position to give a gift next time, he ain't getting it.''</p>
        <p>That was spoken like a patron, as the riders call the dominant rider who sets down the informal rules of the race. Armstrong rejects the role. ''There hasn't been a patron in years,'' he said. ''The last one was Hinault. Racing has changed.'' Hinault retired in 1986.</p>
        <p>Yet Armstrong, a Texan, is in the classic mold of the patron. He intimidates his opponents with his supple power in the mountains and the time trials, convincing them that their attacks will not succeed. So why try? His physical superiority was evident throughout this Tour except on the last of three days in the Alps, and there he lost only two minutes of his seven-and-a-half-minute lead.</p>
        <p>He dominated, he said, over a course that did not please him. ''Last year's course was almost perfect for me: not a lot of climbing relatively, two long time trials -- good time trials for me, in Metz, rolling hills, perfect,'' Armstrong said. ''But this Tour de France, it's almost as if they designed it for other guys. Lots of climbing, one time trial, and the time trial in Jan's hometown.'' He was referring to Jan Ullrich, the German leader of the Telekom team, who finished second over all.</p>
        <p>''Mentally, it was less stressful for me this year,'' Armstrong said. ''Physically, it was more stressful. It was a harder Tour, harder for me, more mountains.''</p>
        <p>Not that he has any complaints now. Asked if he could remember disappointments in the three-week race, Armstrong thought long and hard. ''The team time trial,'' he finally said. ''I thought we could win the team time trial.''</p>
        <p>The U.S. Postal Service finished second among the 20 teams, not really much of a disappointment to anybody but Armstrong.</p>
        <p>''I'm a Virgo,'' he said. ''Always looking for perfection.''</p>
