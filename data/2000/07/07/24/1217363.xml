        <p>Negotiators for striking actors and the advertising industry met face to face last week for the first time in three months. But the talks broke down almost immediately -- apparently dashing hopes for a resolution of the long and bitter labor dispute, which has battered many small businesses that play a role in the production of commercials.</p>
        <p>From casting directors to talent agencies to editing studios, companies in Hollywood and New York have watched their business shrink since 135,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists struck the advertising industry on May 1.</p>
        <p>No one can pinpoint just how much the strike has cost, but the Entertainment Industry Development Corporation, a quasi-public organization, estimates that Los Angeles County is losing about $1 million a day.</p>
        <p>Unlike producers, who are able to escape the reach of American pickets by taking their projects to other English-speaking countries like Canada, Australia and South Africa, many ancillary businesses are stationary. The association that represents camera rental companies figures that business is off by 15 percent. Other trade groups say things are even worse.</p>
        <p>''Everybody's suffering,'' said Nitza From, a New York editor and the president of the East Coast branch of the Association of Independent Commercial Editors.</p>
        <p>''This has been very painful for us,'' said the president of one postproduction house, who has had to lay off 31 employees out of a staff of 220. He requested anonymity because he did not want to publicize his business problems.</p>
        <p>Howard Schwartz, the owner of Recording, a company in New York, said: ''The postproduction industry has been hit very hard. When an actor doesn't work, that's my messenger, my engineer, the music guys -- everybody in the chain.'' Mr. Schwartz has not had to lay off any of his 45 employees, but he has required them to use up vacation time, eliminated overtime, and refrained from replacing people who retire.</p>
        <p>Like other talent agencies that specialize in commercials, Schiffman, Ekman, Morrison &amp; Marx is getting by placing actors in categories not covered by the disputed contract, like personal appearances and industrial films. But the strike is taking a heavy toll, said S. Fred Schiffman, the president of the agency. ''Everybody, I understand, has downsized their office,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The casualties of the work stoppage even include companies at a far remove from the central issue that has prolonged the strike: the compensation structure for actors in television commercials. Bert Berdis &amp; Company, a commercial production house in Hollywood, has furloughed 5 of its 20 employees and imposed a 20 percent pay cut on everyone else. Nearly all of Mr. Berdis's spots are made for radio, not television, yet his commercial business has declined by 50 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berdis signed an interim agreement with Aftra, but he said the large advertising agencies were not giving business to companies covered by these contracts. The advertising industry does not consider these agreements legitimate.</p>
        <p>''What's really frustrating is that this stuff has nothing to do with radio,'' said Mr. Berdis, referring to the issues in the strike, ''and yet all of us are being dragged along into this thing. This makes no sense to me.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday and Friday, at the request of federal mediators, the two sides met for brief negotiating sessions. Both the actors and the industry angrily blamed each other for breaking off the talks.</p>
        <p>''They came back with absolutely nothing,'' said Paul Reggio, a strike coordinator for the unions. ''This is really not a good development. This is going to get ugly now.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview on Saturday, Ira M. Shepard, a negotiator for the advertising industry, said the unions had made no concessions. But he acknowledged that his side had not yielded any ground either and characterized the offer on the table as generous enough. ''We're standing by that,'' he said, ''if that does not buy labor peace, nothing will. There are some people in the union hanging onto the past. I can't make them drink the water. I can only bring them to it.''</p>
        <p>Each side has accused the other of intransigence. ''It's like the Israelis and the Palestinians,'' said Morty Dubin, the chairman of the New York Production Alliance, an industry group. ''Both have points and both have dug in their heels.''</p>
        <p>And both have engaged in a nasty war of words. The advertisers have accused the unions of illegally threatening to blackball nonunion actors who cross their picket lines. Actors have accused the advertisers of trying to destroy their unions. Producers who have chosen to film in the Los Angeles or New York areas have often faced interference from picketers. The unions say they have disrupted numerous shoots, including a campaign spot for Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>The central issue in the strike is how to pay actors for performing in commercials. Negotiators for the advertising industry say they want to eliminate obsolete residual rules from the 1950's, when only a few channels existed.</p>
        <p>Under the current system, most actors get a session fee of $475 a day for their work on the set and a residual each time the spot is shown on network television. But the industry wants to replace residuals with a one-time fee for unlimited use during a 13-week period, the same method used for cable television.</p>
        <p>The actors, however, want residuals -- so-called pay-for-play -- to be retained on network television and extended to cable.</p>
        <p>Both sides say they are holding firm because an important principle is at stake. ''This is about how to modernize a contract,'' Mr. Shepard said. ''The unions want to live with the way the industry was in the 1950's. We want to reflect the industry in the year 2000.'' He said that under the industry's offer, an actor stood to get $4,000 for a single day's work.</p>
        <p>But many actors depend on commercials for a substantial portion of their income. They accuse the advertising industry of trying to shortchange them at a time when revenues are at an all-time high. They say the pay system proposed by the industry would result in career-threatening overexposure, while failing to compensate them for the long intervals between jobs.</p>
        <p>The actors point out that their aggregate pay of about $720 million a year amounts to only about 2 percent of what is spent on producing the spots and buying the time. Mr. Shepard, however, said that if production costs alone are considered, the actors' fees represent from 33 percent to 75 percent.</p>
        <p>Although producers say they are caught in the middle, many blame the unions for forcing them to shoot their commercials in Canada or overseas. ''It's teaching the clients that there's a much cheaper way to do this,'' said Marc Smerling, an owner of Notorious Pictures, a production house in New York. ''Now that the clients know about this, how do you get them to come back?''</p>
        <p>Gary Rose, a vice president of Moxie Pictures, a production company in Los Angeles and New York, said it does not take long for producers to establish the relationships needed to work overseas. ''It's hard to go there the first time, and maybe the second time,'' he said, ''but it's not so hard the third time.'' So many producers are shooting in Vancouver that local camera crews cannot keep up with the demand.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rose and other producers said they would much prefer to work with American actors. ''The members of SAG are probably the most talented pool of actors on the planet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reggio, the union strike coordinator, said the unions should not be held accountable for the increasing reliance on overseas locations. ''These claims are really ringing false,'' he said. ''They've been going out of the country long before our contract expired.''</p>
