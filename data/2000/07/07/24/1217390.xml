        <p>Carolyn McAskie, UN's emergency relief coordinator, is seeking to bring its existing relief agencies into common effort to alleviate plight of millions of internally displaced people, mostly forgotten victims of war who are not regarded as refugees and are struggling to survive without much international help; American UN ambassador, Richard C Holbrooke, is skeptical about so-called collaborative approach and favors designating a new or lead agency to deal with problem (M)</p>

        <p>From the Caucasus to Kosovo, Congo, Colombia and East Timor, millions of people have been displaced by civil war or ethnic violence.

        <p>In recent years, the United Nations has been without a coherent policy for helping those victims of war, known to international agencies as ''internally displaced people,'' or I.D.P.'s.

Some get help, often because they are mixed into refugee populations. Many never do.</p>

        <p>From the Caucasus to Kosovo, Congo, Colombia and East Timor, millions of people have been displaced by civil war or ethnic violence. But almost everywhere, particularly in Africa, they struggle to survive without much, if any, international help because they have not crossed an international border and are not, strictly speaking, refugees.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the United Nations has been without a coherent policy for helping those victims of war, known to international agencies as ''internally displaced people,'' or I.D.P.'s. Because there is no agency and almost no money regularly set aside for these people, responses to crises have been haphazard and often opportunistic. Some get help, often because they are mixed into refugee populations. Many never do.</p>
        <p>The leading United Nations relief official, Carolyn McAskie, said this week that she wanted to look for ways to bring existing United Nations agencies into a common effort to pay more attention to this problem. Although she has yet to appoint a director to coordinate that effort, officials say that the job will go to Dennis McNamara, who has most recently been a deputy to the United Nations administrator of Kosovo.</p>
        <p>In choosing this approach, rather than designating a new or lead agency to deal with the problem, Ms. McAskie, the United Nations' emergency relief coordinator, has placed herself in opposition to the United States, and particularly its ambassador here, Richard C. Holbrooke.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke, who since visiting Africa late last year has been on a campaign for action on the issue,  said this week that he was ''skeptical of the so-called collaborative approach.'' He said American diplomats and aid experts abroad would be asked to report on how coordination is working.</p>
        <p>''Let's see the new system at work,'' he said in a speech to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. ''And ultimately, let's see if it makes any difference on the ground.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Ms. McAskie said  the concept of putting one agency in charge of the internally displaced had been studied. ''We have looked at that option very seriously, and we do honestly believe -- and most of the agencies and quite a few of the governments honestly believe -- that that's not necessarily the best answer, partly because I.D.P.'s are so mixed in with the rest of the population that we have to find ways of addressing the war-affected population as a whole.''</p>
        <p>''I.D.P.s have specific needs, though,'' she acknowledged. ''There's no doubt about it. And we can do better to address that. We've come out with a policy on protection. We're trying to increase the knowledge and awareness of country teams.'' She said that one of the major hurdles to increased help to the internally displaced has been a lack of money.</p>
        <p>Sadako Ogata, who will retire later this year after serving for nearly a decade as United Nations high commissioner for refugees, underlined in a speech in New York last Tuesday that it is more difficult to raise cash to aid displaced people within their own countries than to help other refugee groups.</p>
        <p>''We are failing internally displaced people,'' she said. ''By 'we' I mean to include governments, the United Nations system and the broader humanitarian community. The scale of suffering and the human cost are staggering.'' She said that in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas she had seen ''appalling examples of forced displacement and misery.''</p>
        <p>''In many of these situations,'' she said, ''displacement is not merely a consequence of conflict, but its very objective. The governments responsible for protecting the rights and well-being of internally displaced people are often the cause of their predicament as they pursue calculated strategies aimed at changing the ethnic map of the country or gaining control over its economic resources.''</p>
        <p>The help these uprooted people now get, she acknowledged, ''is selective, uneven and, in many cases, inadequate.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Mrs. Ogata appealed for $8.4 million for 300,000 people who have been forced to flee homes in three provinces in Angola, where 1.5 million people have been displaced since another peace agreement fell apart in 1998. The United States has pledged $2 million to the fund.</p>
        <p>''Will others follow their example?'' Mrs. Ogata asked. ''I will be blunt,'' she said. ''Making a real difference for internally displaced people will require a very substantial and sustained commitment of resources.''</p>
