        <p>Strolling around the serene square of this Basque town not far north of Bilbao, it is hard to imagine the scene as it was some 60 years ago, when an indelible atrocity took place here on the eve of World War II. Only a few outward marks of physical devastation are still visible, but the human damage remains embedded in people's minds.</p>
        <p>If you tap the memories of the survivors of the German bombing during the Spanish Civil War, and listen to local officials and historians who are trying to turn one of the symbols of fascist militarism into a place of peace and reconciliation, the day is always April 26, 1937. That Monday -- a crowded market day when farmers from nearby villages came to Guernica to sell and exchange livestock and produce -- was deliberately chosen by the Luftwaffe to inflict the greatest number of casualties.</p>
        <p>Now a new documentary film, ''The Bombing of Guernica: The Mark of Men,'' has been produced by a peace research center here and is being offered to public and commercial broadcasting stations all over the world. It includes the voices of the people who survived the attack. (The Basques call their most sacred town Gernika; elsewhere, it's known by its Spanish name.)</p>
        <p>Before the civil war Spain's Republican government commissioned Picasso to create a painting for its pavilion at the Paris World's Fair. After learning of the bombing, Picasso said, ''The painting that I am presently working on will be called 'Guernica.' Through it, I express my abhorrence of the race that has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death.'' Working steadily in 1937, he laid out ''Guernica'' in a matter of weeks, creating an apocalyptic scene of grotesque and mutilated human and animal figures depicted in tones of black, white and gray. The painting now hangs behind bulletproof glass in its permanent home at the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid.</p>
        <p>A permanent exhibition at the Guernica Museum in the center of town documents the bombing with photographs and artifacts, including bomb fragments bearing German markings. On that fateful market day a single fighter from the Luftwaffe's Condor Legion circled the town, scouting the best targets. The bells from Santa Maria Church alerted the townspeople that an air attack might be coming. A month before, the Condor Legion had bombed the nearby town of Durango, a center of communications and armaments factories behind Republican lines. The people of Guernica immediately built several flimsy wooden shelters, protected by sandbags, around the town center.</p>
        <p>The bombing began at 4:30 p.m. and continued for three hours. Low-flying Junker bombers appeared over the horizon, coming in waves, unloading thousand-pound bombs and thousands of incendiary projectiles. The German squadrons were protected by Italian fighter planes in the attack, the first jointly coordinated by the forces of Hitler and Mussolini.</p>
        <p>Then came the Luftwaffe's fighter planes, machine-gunning anything that moved. Guernica was flattened in a day; uncounted hundreds of people died from the bombs, shrapnel and fires. Nobody knew the exact number of casualties because the town's population had swelled on that market day.</p>
        <p>On one wall of the Guernica Museum is a framed letter from former President Roman Herzog of Germany, dated March 27, 1997. It acknowledges that the Condor Legion was responsible for the attack. ''It was an indefensible act of aerial bombardment,'' the letter says. ''The victims of this terrible atrocity suffered human anguish. We renounce the bombardment by the German aviators and the horror it caused. Now we call for reconciliation and peace between our two peoples.''</p>
        <p>Copies of Picasso's working drawings for ''Guernica'' are also on display in the museum. An accompanying note says he produced 25 sketches a month after the news of the bombing reached Paris. An oil painting in the spirit of ''Guernica'' covers an entire wall of the exhibition. This triptych by Sofia Gandarias, an artist originally from Guernica, shows the devastation caused by the bombing.</p>
        <p>A few blocks from the Guernica Museum, on the first floor of a small office building in the town square, is the peace research center named, in Basque, Gernika Gogoratuz (Guernica Remembered), where the new documentary was created. ''The horror of that day marks the survivors forever,'' the film's narration says in part. ''What is more, they were forced to conceal the truth about the crime committed against them during the four decades that General Franco's dictatorship held power. Now the survivors don't want the remembrance of this horror to fall into oblivion.'' A slogan accompanies the film: ''Forgive, but never forget.''</p>
        <p>''The Guernica Museum will become the first peace museum in Spain, thanks to the support of the government,'' said Iratxe Momoitio Astorkia, the museum's director.</p>
        <p>Above the town square is a park dedicated to peace and reconciliation. It includes a bronze by Henry Moore called ''Great Figure in a Shelter.'' The Moore, installed in 1990, was commissioned by the Basque regional government and paid for by the Madrid government. The sculpture recalls the helmeted figures that Moore, a Loyalist sympathizer, created during the Spanish Civil War.</p>
        <p>Nearby is a peace monument, ''Our Father's House,'' by Eduardo Chillida. A tall, semi-abstract structure sheathed in concrete, it was installed in 1988 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of a historic moment that the people of Guernica hope will continue to inspire those who seek to end the slaughter of innocent civilians everywhere.</p>
