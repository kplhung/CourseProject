        <p>In his relentless march toward boxing immortality, Felix Trinidad now has his sights on Fernando Vargas, the fast-rising International Boxing Federation junior-middleweight champion.</p>

        <p>In his relentless march toward boxing immortality, Felix Trinidad now has his sights on Fernando Vargas, the fast-rising International Boxing Federation junior-middleweight champion.</p>
        <p>''We're going after Vargas,'' Trinidad said after his technical knockout Saturday night of France's Mamadou Thiam at 2 minutes 48 seconds of the third round before a raucous pro-Trinidad crowd of about 15,000 at American Airlines Arena. ''We've signed to fight. Now he has to sign.''</p>
        <p>The 22-year-old Vargas (19-0), a 1996 Olympian, must first deal with a mandatory defense of his title. He has a fight on Aug. 26 against Ross Thompson.</p>
        <p>If Vargas wins as expected, a match in December against Trinidad is a strong probability, particularly since HBO Sports has contracts with both fighters.</p>
        <p>Trinidad, who is nicknamed Tito, did his part to make it happen Saturday night as he raised his record to 38-0, 31 victories by knockout. He seemed to want to be patient with Thiam, a muscular and power-punching 154-pounder. But 1:40 into the fight, Trinidad caught Thiam with a left uppercut-left hook combination that split the underdog's right eyelid.</p>
        <p>Once he saw weakness, Trinidad didn't wait for an invitation to finish him off. He bolted forward, driving the Frenchman against the ropes with a withering series of punches. Though Thiam remained game, the result appeared inevitable from that point on.</p>
        <p>At first round's end, after Trinidad had landed a punishing 41 punches, he told his corner that Thiam's eye was badly cut and that he didn't expect him to come out for the second round. Instead, Thiam came surging out at the bell, throwing punches wildly as Trinidad backpedaled.</p>
        <p>Soon, however, Thiam stopped long enough for Trinidad to bomb away at the injured eye. By the third round, the eye had swollen shut. Thiam kept throwing punches for a while, but near the round's end he seemed to realize the obvious. When he walked away from Trinidad after one exchange, Referee Jorge Alonso called the fight.</p>
        <p>''We knew he would be a brave opponent, but he lacked Tito's boxing skills,'' said Felix Trinidad Sr., his son's manager and trainer.</p>
        <p>An hour after the fight, an unmarked Trinidad looked as if he was ready to sample the nightclubs on Miami Beach instead of having just defended his World Boxing Association superwelterweight title.</p>
        <p>The promoter Don King said that Thiam had been advertised to him as a fighter who could take Trinidad out. An ''ani-mule,'' as King called him.</p>
        <p>''So I ran to Papa,'' King said, meaning Trinidad Sr. ''I say they say Mamadou is an 'ani-mule' and we may have a problem. So Papa says to me coldly and matter-of-factly, 'Then we'll treat him like an animal.'</p>
        <p>''So what did Papa do? He got Tito prepared to be Dr. Kildare. Because you have never seen a surgical operation performed more magnificently than you've just seen Tito -- Dr. Tito -- perform. He hit him in the lower cardiovascular region, the spleen. He moved up to the cranium, the jaw.</p>
        <p>''He dissected this man in an operation that was second to none.''</p>
        <p>King's delivery was part of a news conference afterward that more closely resembled a love-in, with Thiam off at Jackson Memorial Hospital to be checked for a possible concussion and eye damage.</p>
        <p>Ticket prices for the night ranged for $750 for ringside to $15 high in the upper deck. Trinidad supporters were evident all over the arena. They waved banners and Puerto Rican flags, swayed to the music of their homeland and chanted, ''Tito, Tito, Tito,'' at every opportunity.</p>
        <p>Several times in the aftermath of the fight, King called Trinidad ''the No. 1 fighter in the world.'' At least on this occasion, he had company from Trinidad's father, a demanding man who is perpetually pushing his son toward excellence.</p>
        <p>''I think in this fight he convinced people that, once and for all, he is the greatest boxer in the world,'' the father crowed.</p>
        <p>One thing in his favor is that Trinidad, 27, has not been reluctant to take on the top boxers in or near his weight class. In a distinguished streak before Thiam, he dispatched three Olympic gold medalists -- Pernell Whitaker, Oscar De La Hoya and David Reid. Now Vargas appears next.</p>
        <p>''I'm ready for anyone,'' Trinidad said.</p>
