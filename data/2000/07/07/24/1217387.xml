        <p>The German Parliament hoped to discourage a wave of lawsuits -- and close the door on an ugly past -- when it voted to support a fund through which corporations will compensate people who worked as slave laborers in Germany during World War II. But by agreeing to pay reparations, corporations like  DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank, Siemens and Volkswagen are tacitly admitting that German corporate wealth rests at least partly on slave labor extracted from Jews during the commission of crimes against humanity.</p>
        <p>This has been a big year for institutional contrition, with the Vatican apologizing for misdeeds of the past -- extending back to the Inquisition -- and Swiss banks seeking atonement for appropriating the accounts of Holocaust victims. But in the United States Congress, a bill that would bring about a similar reckoning with regard to two and a half centuries  of slavery may never see the light of day. Legislation sponsored by Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan calling for a study of reparations  has failed to reach the House floor, even after being submitted to Congress every year for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>The failure of Congress to take this bill seriously reflects the sense among Americans as a whole that slavery has no economic bearing on the nation as it exists today. But if a 34-year-old lawyer named Deadria Farmer-Paellmann has her way, a broader debate about reparations and the links between modern corporations and the slave economy may be on the way.</p>
        <p>A part-time musician and amateur historian, Ms. Farmer-Paellmann attended law school solely to develop a legal argument for reparations. After scouring corporate archives, she has turned up connections between modern corporations and predecessor companies that seem clearly to have profited from the slave trade, in some cases obliquely but often quite directly.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the German case, Ms. Farmer-Paellmann is planning to sue a dozen corporations for ''unjustly enriching'' themselves and has already begun distributing archival records that provide provocative examples of corporate involvement in the trade. The planned lawsuits are novel. But the news articles about her first few discoveries have already broadened public awareness of the extent to which the United States depended on slaves to build the national as well as the Southern economy.</p>
        <p>Charles Ogletree, a Harvard Law School professor, is among those paying attention. He says he is considering both litigation and legislation and is helping to plan a conference scheduled this fall on the reparations issue.</p>
        <p>Modern-day Northerners tend to view slavery as confined to the Confederacy, thinking of the Northeast as made up of ''free states.'' Americans are for the most part unaware that slavery covered all of the original colonies and their successor states and began to loosen its grip in the North only in the early 1800's, when personal liberty laws went into effect. New York City was a capital of human bondage, with more slaves than any other city with the possible exception of Charleston, S.C.</p>
        <p>New England survives in the history books as the hotbed of abolitionism and the home of the crusading anti-slavery novelist Harriet Beecher Stowe. But Ms. Farmer-Paellmann has turned up documents revealing a different New England, one in which corporate founders and respected businessmen trafficked in slaves, even after aspects of the slave trade were made illegal.</p>
        <p>One of the most serious offenders was the Rhode Island businessman John Brown, who founded Providence Bank, an early predecessor of the modern FleetBoston Financial Corporation. The Fleet corporate history portrays Brown as a ''respected merchant.'' But Ms. Farmer-Paellmann has unearthed records showing that Brown owned ships that embarked on several slaving voyages and that he was prosecuted in federal court for participating in the international slave trade after it had become illegal under federal law. Records show that Providence Bank lent substantial sums to Brown, and Ms. Farmer-Paellmann suspects that the bank both financed and profited from the founder's illegal slave trading. For its part, FleetBoston contends that incomplete records make a conclusion impossible.</p>
        <p>The most disturbing document to emerge so far reveals that the Aetna Insurance Company of Hartford actually insured slave owners against the loss of their human chattel. That Aetna knew the horrors of slave life is evident in a rider through which the company declined to pay the premium for slaves who were lynched, worked to death or who committed suicide. Aetna says that incomplete records forbid its knowing how many such policies were written. After the  policy came to light, the company apologized for having been involved in the slave trade.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farmer-Paellmann claims to have found similar documents concerning more than a dozen corporations still doing business in this country and has promised to file several lawsuits charging these companies with unjustly enriching themselves at the expense of slaves. Whether or not the lawsuits succeed is almost beside the point. This exercise will have done its job if it reveals to the public the role of slavery in shaping American life. More than a few modern fortunes rest on the suffering of human beings who once accounted for a large portion of American wealth and lived in chains here for 250 years.</p>
