        <p>A whistle-blower's manuscript that the government suppressed on security grounds contains little new information but strongly criticizes the F.B.I. as having mishandled the government's investigation into whether China stole United States nuclear secrets.</p>
        <p>On July 14, F.B.I. agents seized a computer hard drive from the home of Notra Trulock, the former chief of intelligence at the Energy Department, who wrote the manuscript. The Federal Bureau of Investigation acted in what officials described as a preliminary investigation to determine whether the paper disclosed classified information about the espionage case.</p>
        <p>But a review of the 62-page manuscript, obtained by The New York Times, shows that while it is heavy on criticism of the F.B.I. and other agencies, it contains little information about the spy case that has not already been disclosed in the news media or in Congressional hearings.</p>
        <p>The manuscript, which Mr. Trulock had submitted to the Central Intelligence Agency for possible publication in one of its internal journals, presents Mr. Trulock's views of how the investigation into China's possible theft of United States nuclear secrets unfolded. In it, he attacks the F.B.I., as well as other officials from the Energy Department and its Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the bureau said last week that its investigation had not come in reaction to the criticisms in the manuscript.</p>
        <p>A C.I.A. official who screened the manuscript decided that it was an unauthorized release of classified material, and referred the matter to the F.B.I. for investigation. But Mr. Trulock said he had told the F.B.I. that he did not believe the manuscript contained classified information and that he had not had access to classified documents about the case since he left the Energy Department last August.</p>
        <p>The manuscript contains many references to newspaper articles and Congressional testimony as source material.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trulock was a frequent critic of how the government handled the investigation of possible nuclear espionage, asserting that the investigation into China's possible theft of data from the W-88, America's most advanced nuclear warhead, had not been pursued aggressively within the government. He later became the target of criticism himself, as scientists and Asian-American groups attacked the F.B.I. and the Energy Department for making Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at Los Alamos, the focus of the counterintelligence investigation.</p>
        <p>The most controversial passages in his manuscript concern whether the Energy Department and the F.B.I. prematurely focused on the Los Alamos laboratory, and Dr. Lee in particular, as the source of the possible leak of nuclear information to China. Since news of the spy case broke last year, the initial administrative inquiry by the Energy Department and the F.B.I. has drawn widespread criticism within the government for having been too narrowly focused. The F.B.I. has now reopened the investigation to take a broader look at ways in which the nuclear data could have reached the Chinese.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trulock defends the actions of his team of Energy Department and F.B.I. investigators who conducted an initial administrative inquiry in the case, and says that problems came after they turned the case over to the bureau for a full criminal investigation, code-named ''Kindred Spirit.'' His manuscript is called ''Kindred Spirit: The D.O.E. Nuclear Spy Follies.''</p>
        <p>The administrative inquiry was conducted by the Energy Department, with F.B.I. assistance, in late 1995 and early 1996.</p>
        <p>The administrative inquiry considered 70 leads, and eventually narrowed the list to 12 possible suspects, including employees at Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, Mr. Trulock writes. Before paring the list, the team also visited the Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico, which was responsible for the nonnuclear firing components of the warhead. His team considered the Energy Department's Rocky Flats plant in Colorado and the Pantex nuclear complex in Texas, but ruled them out after learning ''that there were no records of foreign travel and no visits by Chinese officials'' at either plant.</p>
        <p>While the inquiry did not focus exclusively on Los Alamos, ''within the overall complex the security vulnerabilities at Los Alamos were striking,'' he writes. ''Los Alamos had largely abandoned security measures intended to track individuals' access'' to classified documents. ''At Lawrence Livermore, we could review records of individuals that had accessed W-88 documents and blueprints, but no such records were maintained at Los Alamos. Employment within Los Alamos's X Division, the laboratory organization responsible for the W-88 design, apparently afforded these employees unmonitored access to nuclear warhead design information.''</p>
        <p>While his team focused on Energy Department facilities as possible sources of the compromise, the F.B.I. was supposed to check other, non-Energy Department facilities as part of a broader investigation. But he later learned that the F.B.I. never did look elsewhere, Mr. Trulock writes.</p>
        <p>''There are several unexplained and unexplored inconsistencies in the F.B.I.'s handling'' of the case, Mr. Trulock writes.</p>
