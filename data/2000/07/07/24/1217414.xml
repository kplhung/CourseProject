        <p>Gil Morgan started the day tied with Bob Murphy and Tom Jenkins, but he used his length from the tee in virtually ideal conditions today to pull away and capture the Instinet Classic by four shots. Morgan feasted on the par 5's at Jasna Polana, playing the holes at 10 under par for the three days.</p>
        <p>Morgan birdied all four par 5's today and shot his second straight six-under 66. Morgan finished with a three-day total of 17-under 199, four shots better than Murphy, who shot 70, and Bruce Fleisher, who shot 66.</p>

        <p>Gil Morgan started the day tied with Bob Murphy and Tom Jenkins, but he used his length from the tee in virtually ideal conditions today to pull away and capture the Instinet Classic by four shots. Morgan feasted on the par 5's at Jasna Polana, playing the holes at 10 under par for the three days.</p>
        <p>Morgan birdied all four par 5's today and shot his second straight six-under 66. Morgan finished with a three-day total of 17-under 199, four shots better than Murphy, who shot 70, and Bruce Fleisher, who shot 66.</p>
        <p>Murphy and Fleisher finished tied for second at 203, a shot better than Jenkins, last year's winner, who shot 71 and finished alone in fourth.</p>
        <p>''My length was definitely an advantage all three days,'' Morgan said. ''I was able to hit a lot of irons to the green and that helped me control the ball better. I had a lot of opportunities for eagles.''</p>
        <p>Morgan broke the tournament record by three shots and earned $210,000. Today's 66 came on eight birdies and two bogeys.</p>
        <p>''Gil won the tournament on the par 5's,'' Murphy said. ''He can reach all of them with his length, and I didn't play well enough to get the job done.''</p>
        <p>Morgan, whose play had been limited this year by a pulled rib muscle, won his second tournament of the year and 17th on the Senior Tour. His other victory this season came at the Emerald Classic in late March.</p>
        <p>The event was played at three sites in Pennsylvania before it moved here this year. Instinet made a three-year commitment to stage the $1.4 million tournament at Jasna Polana, a 2-year-old course built on the grounds of a former country home.</p>
        <p>Arnold Palmer was the tournament's sentimental favorite. He was playing in his 1,000th PGA event, joining Miller Barber, Gay Brewer and Dave Eichelberger as the only golfers to achieve the feat. Palmer, who started his career in 1949 at the age of 19, was honored before he teed off on opening day, and he drew the largest gallery each day.</p>
        <p>''I can remember almost everything that happened in 1949,'' Palmer said. He remembered whom he played with (Freddie Haas) on the first day of his first professional tournament, who won (George Low) and where he finished (last after shooting 76-75-75-76).</p>
        <p>Palmer's followers applauded loudly today even when he made double-bogey on the 441-yard ninth.</p>
        <p>His biggest accomplishment was a birdie on the 203-yard eighth hole, where he made triple-bogey on Saturday on his way to a 76. Palmer ended with a 73 for a three-day total of 220.</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>JOE INMAN, who started the day at four under, shot a 66 with six birdies and finished at 10-under 206. Inman was tied with JIM DENT, who shot 70, and JIM COLBERT, who shot 69. . . . JIM ALBUS and HALE IRWIN were next at nine-under-par 207. . . . GIL MORGAN broke CHI CHI RODRIGUEZ's 1987 mark of 14-under 202. His margin of victory was the second largest in the 16-year history of the event.</p>
