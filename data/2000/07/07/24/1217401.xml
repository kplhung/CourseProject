        <p>A cardiac surgeon in Houston who described himself as a longtime friend of the Bush family said today that both Gov. George W. Bush and his father, former President George Bush, had asked him on Friday to consult by telephone with one of Richard B. Cheney's physicians and help determine if Mr. Cheney ''was up to a strenuous campaign.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview today, the surgeon, Denton A. Cooley, said that after the Bushes made that request, he spoke almost immediately with Mr. Cheney's physician.

        <p>A cardiac surgeon in Houston who described himself as a longtime friend of the Bush family said today that both Gov. George W. Bush and his father, former President George Bush, had asked him on Friday to consult by telephone with one of Richard B. Cheney's physicians and help determine if Mr. Cheney ''was up to a strenuous campaign.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview today, the surgeon, Denton A. Cooley, said that after the Bushes made that request, he spoke almost immediately with Mr. Cheney's physician. And several hours later, Dr. Cooley said, both the governor and the former president got back in touch with him to check his findings about Mr. Cheney, which were favorable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, the former defense secretary and the man supervising the process by which Governor Bush chooses a running mate, emerged over the last two days as a leading contender for the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket. And one reason many Republican officials were surprised by that development was Mr. Cheney's health. More than a decade ago, he had three mild heart attacks.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cheney has apparently not had any heart trouble in recent years, and Dr. Cooley said that he told both of the Bushes, who placed separate calls to him, that Mr. Cheney's physician in Washington ''thought he was certainly capable and fit enough to go through a national campaign.'' Dr. Cooley added that the governor and former president both seemed pleased by that news.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cooley's actions, first reported today by ABC News, were yet another sign of the seriousness with which Mr. Cheney, whom one high-ranking Republican official described today as the front-runner to share the Republican ticket with Governor Bush, is being considered for the job. On the same day that the Bushes were reaching out to Dr. Cooley, Mr. Cheney changed his voter registration from Texas to Wyoming, a state he represented in Congress for many years, thereby eliminating a potential constitutional hurdle to being the vice-presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>And late last week, according to a report by the Associated Press today, Mr. Cheney began telling business associates at Halliburton, the Dallas energy company where he is a top executive, that there was a ''good chance'' he would be the vice presidential nominee. Mr. Cheney reportedly wanted to alert them because he had previously indicated that he was not interested in being the nominee.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the way in which Dr. Cooley's help was solicited raised questions about the extent of President Bush's involvement in his son's deliberations over a running mate. The Texas governor said on Friday that his father, in whose administration Mr. Cheney served as the defense secretary, had mainly played the role of ''a good listener.''</p>
        <p>Asked tonight about President Bush's role, Karen P. Hughes, the communications director for the Bush campaign, said, ''Only the governor can answer that question, and I'm sure he will be happy to once the process is complete.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes said she could neither confirm nor deny that Dr. Cooley had acted on the Bushes' request to help assess Mr. Cheney's health. Referring to the various people whose names have been floated as vice-presidential prospects for Mr. Bush, Ms. Hughes said, ''I think it's important to respect the privacy of all these individuals until such time as Governor Bush makes a decision.''</p>
        <p>One adviser to Mr. Bush said tonight that the governor had not contacted any of his closest aides or anyone on his list of potential vice presidents to say that he had made his decision, which he is expected to announce sometime this week. The comments of several of Mr. Bush's advisers pointed to Tuesday as the likeliest day for that announcement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush spent today in the peace, quiet and seclusion of his ranch about 90 miles northwest of here, and he did not plan to return to Austin, where the announcement will almost certainly be made, until midday Monday, his aides said. Mr. Bush said on Friday that he would spend the weekend making final deliberations.</p>
        <p>One of his aides cautioned anew today that despite all the speculation about Mr. Cheney and, to a lesser extent, about former Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, with whom the Texas governor met for several hours on Tuesday, Mr. Bush might yet have a surprise in store. But a high-ranking Republican official said Mr. Cheney appeared to be the leading candidate.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Danforth seemed to agree. The Associated Press reported that as he headed into a church in St. Louis this morning, he said: ''I think it's Cheney. You know, with the registration change, that's what I believe.'' Property records from 1999 show that Mr. Cheney has a home in Casper, Wyo.</p>
        <p>There were other possible indicators that Mr. Cheney might be Mr. Bush's pick. One Republican official said that before Dr. Cooley's telephone call Mr. Cheney had undergone a thorough physical examination last week.</p>
        <p>But it was unclear whether the exam was performed by the physician with whom Dr. Cooley spoke. Dr. Cooley could not recall the physician's name and remembered only that this physician's review of Mr. Cheney's health had been performed within the last few weeks or months.</p>
        <p>Several of Mr. Bush's senior advisers and other prominent Republicans fanned out on the morning news programs, where much of what they said amounted to defenses of potential criticisms of Mr. Cheney's selection and arguments for why Mr. Cheney represented a terrific choice. They repeatedly said, however, that Mr. Bush had not made a decision.</p>
        <p>On CBS's ''Face the Nation,'' Karl Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush campaign, said that Mr. Cheney's history of heart trouble was not cause for concern. ''Those heart attacks occurred in the 70's and 80's, and he then served as secretary of defense in President Bush's administration and presided over Desert Storm,'' Mr. Rove noted.</p>
        <p>The three heart attacks, in 1978, 1984 and 1988, that Mr. Cheney, 59, suffered were all mild, and he had bypass surgery in 1988, before his high-profile assignment in the Bush administration. Mr. Cheney had previously served as President Gerald Ford's chief of staff.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cooley said he did not review specific test results or data with Mr. Cheney's physician but simply listened carefully to his assessment of Mr. Cheney's health.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cooley said that what the Bushes wanted to know about Mr. Cheney was ''how fit he was and was he up to a strenuous campaign.'' Dr. Cooley concluded that he was.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Cheney and Mr. Danforth, 63, are in many ways dissimilar, both have decades of government experience that stand in bold counterpoint to Mr. Bush's five and a half years as Texas governor, the only office he has held. Some Republican strategists said today that the willingness of Mr. Bush, 54, to turn to older political veterans suggested how confident and comfortable he was with his own abilities.</p>
        <p>But others said it was a possible sign that Mr. Bush or his advisers were acting to blunt any concerns among voters that Mr. Bush did not have enough seasoning to lead the country.</p>
