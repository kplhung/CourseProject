        <p>The old adage that age is a state of mind is a bunch of bunk, said Reggie Jones, who, at the age of 73, may be the oldest lifeguard in the Western Hemisphere. Age, in the opinion of Mr. Jones, is a state of nature.</p>
        <p>''You can't beat the Reaper, but you can put him off,'' he said, and to prove his point, Mr. Jones pulled an old photograph of himself from a chest of drawers inside Lifeguard Shack 5 at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island. It was an old black-and-white of a young Reggie Jones dated 1944 -- his first year on the beach -- and he looked something like a muscular Sal Mineo.</p>

        <p>The old adage that age is a state of mind is a bunch of bunk, said Reggie Jones, who, at the age of 73, may be the oldest lifeguard in the Western Hemisphere. Age, in the opinion of Mr. Jones, is a state of nature.</p>
        <p>''You can't beat the Reaper, but you can put him off,'' he said, and to prove his point, Mr. Jones pulled an old photograph of himself from a chest of drawers inside Lifeguard Shack 5 at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island. It was an old black-and-white of a young Reggie Jones dated 1944 -- his first year on the beach -- and he looked something like a muscular Sal Mineo.</p>
        <p>The beach was not named after Mr. Jones, he would like you to know. (It was named after Maj. Thomas Jones, an 18th-century whaler and part-time pirate.) Reggie Jones is, in fact, two years older than the park that Robert Moses built. He is also older than the dark, cake-shaped shack that he works from. The shack has no plumbing or glass windows and houses a half-dozen men like Mr. Jones who have more than 35 years on the job.</p>
        <p>It is affectionately called Jurassic Park by the other lifeguards at Jones Beach. And these old men with the boyish faces think Ponce de Leon was a fool. Instead of traipsing around the Everglades in search of the fountain of youth, they believe the explorer should have known he was sailing on it.</p>
        <p>''You spend a life staring at shells and sand and salt and swells, it does something good to you,'' said Jay O'Neill, 66, a retired insurance broker who is working his 48th year on the big white chair. ''It is the best job I ever had.''</p>
        <p>It is halfway through the summer season and, on many beaches, lifeguard jobs still go wanting. From Westchester to New York City to the Jersey Shore, it seems young people no longer find the clean, glamorous job appealing. Not even for $10 an hour. It's gotten so bad that Ocean City, N.J., is digging through its personnel files and asking the old-timers to fill the empty observation chairs.</p>
        <p>But on the Long Island waters there is a surfeit of young candidates who want to work. The problem here is that the young bulls must wait for the aging pachyderms to ramble off to the tar pits. This season, 120 applicants tried out, 80 qualified and 50 were hired. The job on Long Island is popular.</p>
        <p>The reasons are many, the lifeguards say. State parks pay more than others, from $11 an hour for a beginner to $20 for a captain. The state park lifeguards have a union, and they are paid for inclement days. And then there is a certain esprit de corps that comes from working on one of the world's most famous beaches.</p>
        <p>''I'd rather watch the tomatoes walk by than watch them grow in the backyard,'' said Mr. Jones, who has the old habit of pardoning himself before he curses or says something risque, as he does in a complimentary fashion when beautiful women pass by. ''Jeez, I'm a terrible character.''</p>
        <p>None of the guards can coast on their reputations. Each year, the applicants -- new and old -- must swim 100 yards in 75 seconds to requalify, and every year Mr. Jones has done it. ''I go ocean swimming in the winter,'' he said. ''It's my physical. If I don't drop dead from a heart attack, I'm back for another year.''</p>
        <p>Henry J. Stern, New York City's parks commissioner, who has had trouble over the last few summers attracting enough qualified people to guard his beaches, was flabbergasted to learn that a man of Mr. Jones's age was still employed as a lifeguard. ''How's his vision?'' the commissioner asked.</p>
        <p>Perfect, he was told.</p>
        <p>''Hmmm,'' said Mr. Stern, who is 65. ''I've got to find something to do after I retire.''</p>
        <p>Of the 240 lifeguards at Jones Beach, one -- Mr. Jones -- started in the 1940's, 9 in the 1950's, 36 in the 1960's, 58 in the 1970's, 74 in the 1980's and 62 in the 1990's. They performed  2,079 rescues at Jones Beach last year, and no one drowned.</p>
        <p>''As far as anybody knows, Reggie's the dinosaur of the ocean,'' said Joe Scalise, the water safety director for the state beaches on Long Island. ''He keeps himself in phenomenal shape. He outdoes a lot of the young people.''</p>
        <p>His skin is clear and cancer free, his mind sharp. He maintains a rigorous training regimen throughout the year that includes running, swimming and weight lifting. With a youthful body, the leathered neck of a turtle, sea-kelp eyebrows, and an old hat with a button that reads ''older than dirt'' and a grimy sea gull feather, Reggie Jones is hard to miss from his perch atop the lifeguard stand. He reckons he has made more than a thousand rescues in his career, including saving a swimmer's  toupee and a few sets of dentures.</p>
        <p>''The toughest rescue was the fat man who floated out to sea, with me holding on to him,'' Mr. Jones said. ''It was '47, in the middle of a fog bank. He had to be 300 pounds. I got him, though. I never lost anyone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones met his wife near the Jones Beach concession stands 50 years ago. He is still happily married, still thick chested, but carries an extra 10 pounds and has lost half his hair since then.</p>
        <p>Other things have changed in half a century, as well.</p>
        <p>Dress, for instance. People used to wear full-body woolens. ''Now they wear dental floss,'' Mr. Jones said. ''The first bikini walked on the beach around 1952. She nearly caused a riot and the police took her away.''</p>
        <p>There are minority swimmers at the beach. The overpasses on the parkways to Jones Beach were deliberately built too low to allow buses to fit under them. ''City people got cars now,'' Mr. Jones observed, which has broadened the beach's accessibility.</p>
        <p>Still, the crowds seem to be half the size they once were, he said. ''There were no malls then. No air-conditioning. No backyard pools. Everything was closed on Sunday. The beach was the only game in town.''</p>
        <p>The most egregious change? ''The suits got smaller and the people got bigger,'' he bitterly complained. ''America is fat.''</p>
