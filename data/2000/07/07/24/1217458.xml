        <p>IT was a sticky day at the Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremonies here yesterday afternoon, and it wasn't just the sultry weather. These events are annually filled with sweet platitudes, generous and warm reminiscences, and appreciative, sometimes choked-up emotions regarding mom, apple pie and the high, hard one. This year, there was something else: a possible walkout by some of the Hall of Famers.</p>
        <p>To be honored this year on the stage at one end of a large field at Clark Sports Center in this lovely village were not only some wonderful participants on the baseball diamond over the years -- the slugger Tony Perez, the catcher Pudge Fisk, the manager Sparky Anderson, the late Negro League center fielder Turkey Stearnes, who hit .359 during his 18-year career, and the 19th-century second baseman Bid McPhee, one of baseball's last bare-handed players.</p>

        <p>IT was a sticky day at the Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremonies here yesterday afternoon, and it wasn't just the sultry weather. These events are annually filled with sweet platitudes, generous and warm reminiscences, and appreciative, sometimes choked-up emotions regarding mom, apple pie and the high, hard one. This year, there was something else: a possible walkout by some of the Hall of Famers.</p>
        <p>To be honored this year on the stage at one end of a large field at Clark Sports Center in this lovely village were not only some wonderful participants on the baseball diamond over the years -- the slugger Tony Perez, the catcher Pudge Fisk, the manager Sparky Anderson, the late Negro League center fielder Turkey Stearnes, who hit .359 during his 18-year career, and the 19th-century second baseman Bid McPhee, one of baseball's last bare-handed players.</p>
        <p>Also on hand was the Cincinnati Reds play-by-play announcer, Marty Brennaman. According to Bob Feller, the former Cleveland pitching ace, word had spread on Saturday that Brennaman, a supporter of Pete Rose for the Hall of Fame, was going to use his acceptance speech, for the Ford C. Frick award for the broadcasters' wing of the Hall of Fame, to promote Rose's cause.</p>
        <p>''If he does,'' Feller said, ''a bunch of us will walk out. It's all arranged.''</p>
        <p>Forty-five members of the Hall of Fame, a record turnout for this event, were seated on the stage behind the podium. Rose's banishment from baseball in 1989 for betting on games while a manager of the Reds has caused a continuing consternation, not only in baseball circles but beyond, as well. The fact that Rose is the career hits leader in major league baseball would certainly have elevated him into the Hall of Fame by now. But he was taken off the eligibility list by Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti and never put back on.</p>
        <p>In his remarks, Brennaman thanked those who were important in his life, including members of the Reds, such as Johnny Bench and Joe Morgan and Perez, who sat behind him, and those from the 1975-76 Big Red Machine ''who should be here -- Bob Howsam, the general manager; Dave Concepcion, the shortstop, and yes, by God, Peter Edward Rose.''</p>
        <p>That was all. And a number of the Hall of Famers who would have walked -- Feller, Frank Robinson and Ralph Kiner, among them -- sat.</p>
        <p>They sat while Anderson mentioned Rose among the great players he managed, and they sat while Perez said that ''among the classy individuals I played with or against'' that he ''wished were here'' was Pete Rose.</p>
        <p>''He didn't chew on it,'' Feller later said about Brennaman's remarks. ''Otherwise we certainly would have walked out. Pete Rose had his chance to make it here, and he blew it. We would have come back for the speeches of the others.''</p>
        <p>Kiner said that, yes, he would have walked out as well. ''From what I understand,'' Kiner said, ''Rose was caught gambling on baseball. If he didn't, he could have proved his innocence. This is not a personal thing. It's about the rules of baseball.''</p>
        <p>Morgan, a longtime friend and teammate of Rose's, is opposed to Rose being in the Hall of Fame as long as the gambling charge hangs over his head. ''But I wouldn't have walked out,'' he said. ''This day should not be about Pete Rose. It's about respect for the Hall of Fame. I thought it would have been disrespectful to Tony and Sparky and Pudge if we had walked out. This is their day, and they earned it.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Carlton Ernest Fisk, now a well-knit 53, had a wholly remarkable, if not singular, career. The 11-time All-Star caught more games than anyone in major league history -- 2,226 -- in a career that began with the Red Sox in 1972 (his first full season), and ended in 1993 with the White Sox. He not only hit a record 351 homers as a catcher, but hit 72 of them after the age of 40, another record. ''I went 0 for 13 in my first time in the big leagues,'' Fisk said, ''and I was the No. 3 catcher. At the end of that season I was the first unanimous choice for rookie of the year in the American League.''</p>
        <p>He talked about how he had five knee operations, and had his left knee reconstructed after a collision at home plate in Cleveland in 1974. ''Today, I can't squat anymore,'' he said. ''The good thing is, I don't have to, except to read a putt, and then I bend from the waist.''</p>
        <p>Not only did Fisk give credit to family and baseball instructors and teammates, but, unusual for players who forget the struggle against the owners, thanked Marvin Miller and Don Fehr, the former and current executive directors of the Major League Players Association. And he mentioned new baseball terms, like ''collusion,'' in which owners held down salaries -- one of those owners being Bud Selig, then of the Milwaukee Brewers, and now commissioner of baseball. At these remarks, Selig, seated nearby, found the program in his hands particularly absorbing.</p>
        <p>Perez, a Cuban by birth who adopted Puerto Rico as his home, thanked people in English and in Spanish. He recalled visiting his mother in Puerto Rico after he had made a success in the major leagues, on his way to, among other achievements, batting in 100 or more runs in seven seasons. She had cried when he left to play baseball at 16.</p>
        <p>''And now,'' Perez said, ''her eyes were wet with happiness.'' Anderson, who was the only manager to win a World Series in both leagues -- with Cincinnati and Detroit -- and third in total victories to Connie Mack and John McGraw, said his approach was to treat people with kindness and dignity. Anything else?</p>
        <p>''Having smart coaches around me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the end, none of the Hall of Famers bolted in protest. It was just as well. After all, it was, as Morgan said, a day to honor achievement. And one day, Rose may very well make it to the Hall of Fame. As he should. He earned it on the field. There was never any evidence that he gambled on baseball as a player, and he was never accused of it.</p>
        <p>And it's as a player, not a manager, that he would be considered. Sleep well, Marty Brennaman.</p>
