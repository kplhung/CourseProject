        <p>Vice President Al Gore blew into Gov. George W. Bush's home territory today to try to undercut the governor's popularity, suggesting that Mr. Bush's priorities were skewed and had made Texas a backwater where big oil interests are more important than children's health.</p>
        <p>''Now, this is a wonderful state,'' Mr. Gore said. ''But I think it should be -- and I think most people agree -- it should be a state where it's just as easy to raise a child as it is to set up an oil rig.''</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore blew into Gov. George W. Bush's home territory today to try to undercut the governor's popularity, suggesting that Mr. Bush's priorities were skewed and had made Texas a backwater where big oil interests are more important than children's health.</p>
        <p>''Now, this is a wonderful state,'' Mr. Gore said. ''But I think it should be -- and I think most people agree -- it should be a state where it's just as easy to raise a child as it is to set up an oil rig.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also confronted head on the common assumption, backed up in polls, that voters prefer Mr. Bush's personality, warning that the presidency was not a ''popularity contest.''</p>
        <p>''I understand that Governor Bush is a popular and well-liked governor here, and I want to give him some credit on that score,'' Mr. Gore told a hastily arranged forum of a dozen adults, including Democratic state legislators, three single mothers and a few squirming children.</p>
        <p>''I think he has a warm and engaging personality but, you know, the presidency is more than just a popularity contest,'' Mr. Gore went on. ''It involves whether or not you're willing to fight for what's right, whether or not you're willing to spend popularity to do difficult, hard things. And that's where you get to priorities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore diverted his campaign to Texas today to try to take advantage of questions emerging about the state budget, which has $610 million in cost overruns.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign, which called Mr. Gore's visit a gimmick, said the vice president was raising more questions about his own credibility than he was about the stewardship of Texas, accusing him of distorting the budget situation.</p>
        <p>The state comptroller, a Republican supporter of Mr. Bush, announced today that the state had $1.4 billion in cash on hand, more than enough to cover any spending overruns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush held a brief news conference at the governor's mansion this afternoon and, when asked about Mr. Gore's visit, said, ''I welcome him here.''</p>
        <p>But in prepared remarks that were never delivered, Mr. Bush took a tougher line.</p>
        <p>''I am disappointed that the vice president of all the United States would come to one of those states and try to mislead people about its budget,'' his statement said. ''Our Texas budget is balanced and in the black. We have a surplus of $1.4 billion in the bank. For Vice President Gore to claim otherwise for his own political purposes is a travesty -- he should be ashamed.''</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said Mr. Gore's chief distortion was painting a $1.7 billion tax cut pushed by Mr. Bush and his allies as a special break for the oil industry. Mr. Bartlett said that the oil industry's share amounted to just $20 million, and that most of the tax break had been applied to reducing school property taxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said the central question was one of priorities. His press secretary, Chris Lehane, said Mr. Bush's priorities ''raise questions about whether he has what it takes to be president.''</p>
        <p>This was a theme that Mr. Gore had tried out earlier this spring but dropped when advisers said it was too early to be so negative. It still seemed the major risk today for Mr. Gore, which is why he opened his remarks with a nod to Mr. Bush's congeniality, Gore supporters acknowledged. Still, his advisers said this would become a central theme as the campaign developed.</p>
        <p>For his setting today, Mr. Gore chose a hotel on the outskirts of town, nailing down the details about midnight the night before.</p>
        <p>His format was intimate: people  sat on chairs and a couch next to Mr. Gore, who was facing a bank of cameras, including those of CNN, which broadcast the event live. On the blue-curtained backdrop, aides had pinned Lone Star flags, suggesting that the vice president was staking a claim in the heart of Bush territory.</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Gore changes the minds of many Texans remains to be seen, but they were not really the audience today. At the moment, nearly three-fourths of the state's voters say they support Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Gore aides conceded that today's event was aimed chiefly at voters beyond Texas, particularly swing voters, women and core Democrats who may find the governor an appealing figure, but who would be offended at what Mr. Gore tried to portray as Mr. Bush's disregard for health care, children and the environment.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Gore's most serious charges was that Texas had not only favored oil companies and other special interests over health care for children, but that it had deliberately made applying for children's health insurance a cumbersome process, so the state would have more money available for the oil companies.</p>
        <p>''If a state finds ways to discourage families from signing up for CHIP, the state saves money in its budget,'' Mr. Gore said, referring to the government Children's Health Insurance Program. ''If they create obstacles, and families get the idea they shouldn't participate, the state can use the money for other things, like a tax break for the oil companies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bartlett, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said Mr. Gore was blurring the line between Medicaid and the health insurance program. He said that applications for the children's health program were simple and could be mailed in. Mr. Bartlett also said that, contrary to Mr. Gore's assertion, Texas was one of 12 states, not the only one, that required people to reapply every six months for Medicaid.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Gore's comments on Mr. Bush's personality, Mr. Bartlett said: ''This contest is going to be, 'Who do the American people trust with their money and their priorities?' And if we're going to base this on the fiscal stewardship of Texas compared to the lack of Al Gore's credibility, we relish the fight.''</p>
