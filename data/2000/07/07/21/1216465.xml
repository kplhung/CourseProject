        <p>United Airlines, already reeling from the refusal of many of its 10,000 pilots to work overtime, is now facing similar difficulties from its 15,000 mechanics.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Ron Utecht, United's senior vice president for maintenance, circulated a letter to mechanics complaining that flight cancellations and delays related to maintenance had more than doubled since July 12, the day the airline's contract with the International Association of Machinists expired.</p>
        <p>Mr. Utecht added that the number of United airplanes out of service had also doubled, while the number of mechanics willing to work overtime had plunged. He threatened to order mandatory overtime if the airline's maintenance operations did not improve.</p>
        <p>In addition, several mechanics were issued form letters informing them that they were engaged in an ''illegal job action'' and could be dismissed if they did not stop.</p>
        <p>A United spokesman declined to say how many of its 2,400 daily flights were affected by the mechanics' actions, but he said that the impact had been relatively minor.</p>
        <p>Scotty Ford, president of the local representing the mechanics, called Mr. Utecht's letter counterproductive. The International Association of Machinists ''has not authorized nor encouraged any job action at United Airlines,'' he said in a statement. ''Threats and counterthreats will not help United, our members, or the traveling public,'' he added.</p>
        <p>In recent months, United has canceled more flights and reported the worst on-time performance of any major carrier, according to government statistics. The airline blames  unusually bad weather and the air traffic control system for most of its difficulties. But it also says that it was caught by surprise when many of its pilots stopped flying overtime after their contract expired April 12. The pilots' union also says that it is not engaged in any job action.</p>
        <p>United has since cut its summer flying schedule by 4,800 flights, or about 2 percent, to compensate for the crew shortages and has taken several other initiatives, like adding more time to its schedules, to try to improve its on-time performance.</p>
        <p>''Reliability is obviously a core objective for us, and we are determined to get it back to the levels our customers expect,'' Rono J. Dutta, United's president, said on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Last week, as the expiration of the  contract with the machinists approached, United executives said they were confident that the union would not disrupt the airline's operations. But it appears that some of the machinists are as upset as the pilots.</p>
        <p>In 1994, the two groups received a majority of the stock in United's parent company, the UAL Corporation, in exchange for deep wage cuts and other concessions that helped return the airline to profitability and made UAL the largest employee-owned company in the world. Both are expecting to reap big rewards for their sacrifices in their new contracts.</p>
        <p>United said that it was committed to signing industry-leading contracts but that the negotiations might take longer than expected.</p>
        <p>It is not unusual for airlines to conclude new employee contracts years after the old ones expire. But the pilots and mechanics say they were led to believe that United would act differently.</p>
