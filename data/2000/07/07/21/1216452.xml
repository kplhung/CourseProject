        <p>OPERA FESTIVAL OF NEW JERSEY. The Opera Festival of New Jersey's production of Hugo Weisgall's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author'' should help this important 1956 opera gain the honored place in the repertory it deserves. Like the play by Pirandello on which it is based, this haunting work shatters the boundaries between illusion and reality. Despite a few miscalculations, the Opera Festival's starkly realistic production is quite effective. Barbara Day Turner conducts. The cast includes Michaela Gurevich, Robert Orth and Rosalind Elias. The final performance is tomorrow night. Tonight and on Sunday afternoon there will be two performances of Frank Lewin's ''Burning Bright,'' based on the play by John Steinbeck. Mr. Lewin, who also wrote the libretto, worked on the opera for more than 20 years, while teaching full-time and composing other works. It received its premier in 1989 at Yale University. These will be the opera's first professional performances.  McCarter Theater, 91 University Place, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J. ''Burning Bright,'' tonight at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m.; ''Six Characters in Search of an Author,'' tomorrow at 8 p.m. Tickets: $24 to $82. Information, tickets and directions: (609) 258-2787 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>ASTON MAGNA. The early-music scene in the Northeast has long shifted between New York and Boston, and what better middle ground is there in the summer than the Berkshire Hills? (Just ask the Boston Symphony Orchestra and New York listeners, who meet annually at Tanglewood.) This weekend the Aston Magna festival offers a program of arias and instrumental works by Handel, Bach and Purcell. Daniel Stepner, a violinist and the artistic director, is joined by Nancy Armstrong, a soprano; Peter Sykes, a harpsichordist; and Loretta O'Sullivan, a cellist. Tomorrow night at 6, St. James Church, off Main Street, Great Barrington, Mass., (413) 528-3595. Tickets: $20 at the door; $18.50 in advance; $16 for students and the elderly. The program is also to be presented tonight at 8 at Bard College, Route 9G, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (914) 758-7425. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and the elderly (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. This floating concert hall on the East River offers both the novel and the familiar this weekend. Its program tonight includes two chamber works by composers best known for their operas: Rossini, who is represented by his Sonata No. 3 for Two Violins, Cello and Bass, and Puccini, whose ''Chrysanthemums'' will be heard. Also on the program is ''Chant II,'' a collaboration between DeBorge Pinnington, a soprano, and Mark Peskanov, a violinist. The other players are Krista Bennion Feeney, violinist; Toby Hoffman, violist; Nathaniel Rosen, cellist; and John Feeney, bassist. Tomorrow and Sunday, Mr. Peskanov, Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Rosen join Yuval Waldman, violinist, and Alexander Peskanov, pianist, in the Brahms F minor Piano Quintet (Op. 34). Mr. Peskanov, the pianist (and brother of the violinist) will also play several solo piano works -- Beethoven's 32 Variations in C minor, two Schubert Impromptus and Prokofiev's Sonata No. 3 . Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing, at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $27, $15 for students and $25 for the elderly (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>CARAMOOR INTERNATIONAL MUSIC FESTIVAL. That the yearly ''Bel Canto at Caramoor'' evening has become a highlight of the summer music festival is a tribute to the conductor, vocal coach, music historian and sometimes critic Will Crutchfield. Mr. Crutchfield is an expert on bel canto, and whatever he lacks as a baton technician he makes up for in stylistic understanding and involvement. This summer's opera is Bellini's seldom-heard ''Pirata,'' which will be given concert performance, with minimal staging, tomorrow night. The cast includes the sopranos Indra Thomas and Laura Danehower Whyte; the tenors Francisco Almanza and Richard Slade; and the basses Valerino Lanchas and Daniel Mobbs. Mr. Crutchfield conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's. Tonight the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble presents an all-Bach concert with the soprano Heidi Grant Murphy among the soloists. And on Sunday afternoon the revered pianist Alicia de Larrocha gives a recital. St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble: tonight at 8; the Spanish Courtyard; tickets $25. Bellini's ''Pirata'': tomorrow at 8 p.m.; the Venetian Theater; tickets $75, $60, $45, $30. Alicia de Larrocha, piano: Sunday at 4:30 p.m.; the Venetian Theater; tickets $35, $25. Caramoor Festival, Katonah, N.Y. For directions and tickets, call: (914) 232-5035 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>INTERNATIONAL KEYBOARD INSTITUTE AND FESTIVAL. This is the second annual summer session of the International Keyboard Institute and Festival, directed by  Jerome Rose, a two-week examination of the art of the piano, with concerts, master classes, panels and lectures. The event is sponsored by the Mannes College of Music. The highlights of the final weekend include a master class and concert by the pianist Anton Kuerti, and a lecture-recital called ''Inventing Bach's Inventions'' by the pianist Michael Oelbaum, whose lecture-recital on Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations last summer was hotly debated. The festival also sponsors a competition for young pianists, the Dorothy MacKenzie Awards. The semifinal and final rounds, open to the public, are being held throughout the weekend. Anton Kuerti master class: today at noon; Anton Kuerti recital: tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Michael Oelbaum lecture/recital: tonight at 8; Dorothy MacKenzie Awards: semi-finals are tomorrow at 2 p.m. finals are Sunday at 2 p.m. All events are at the Mannes College of Music, 150 West 85th Street, except for the finals of the Dorothy MacKenzie Awards, which will be held at Steinway Hall, 109 West 57th Street. Concerts are $15; lectures and masterclasses are $10. For information, call: (212) 580-0210, ext. 336 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>MARLBORO. Part festival, part training camp for aspiring and accomplished young musicians from Curtis, Juilliard and other conservatories, Marlboro has a special atmosphere of collegiality and shared love of the art. The current season is its 50th, and it has a lot to celebrate, not least the stewardship of its new co-directors, the exceptional pianists Richard Goode and Mitsuko Uchida. Tonight it is presenting the Brattleboro Music Festival's annual Bach concert, a program of Cantatas (Nos. 32, 60 and 147) performed by the New England Bach Festival Orchestra and Blanche Moyse Chorale. Ms. Moyse, one of Marlboro's founders, is conducting. Also on the schedule is a pair of chamber programs in which students and their teachers share the stands. The first, tomorrow, includes Prokofiev's String Quartet No. 1, Brahms's Neue Liebeslieder (Op. 65) and Dvorak's String Quintet in E flat (Op. 97). The Sunday concert includes Brahms's Zwei Gesange; Dvorak's Piano Quartet in E flat (Op. 87), Reger's Serenade in D (Op. 77a) and Berg's String Quartet (Op. 3). Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Marlboro Music Festival, off Route 9, Marlboro, Vt. (802) 254-2394. Tickets: $5 to $25 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>MAVERICK. This enterprising chamber music series, now in its 85th season, offers concerts in an open-sided barn where the sounds of nature and the music of man interact freely. One of its annual offerings is a percussion concert, called ''Woodstock Beat.'' This year's installment includes performances by Liam Teague, a steel drum player from Trinidad, as well as Garry Kristad, Stacy Bowers and other percussionists. The Sunday afternoon concert was to have been by the Shanghai Quartet, but they have postponed their Maverick appearance, ceding their place to the Miro Quartet, a promising ensemble that won the Naumburg competition this year. The program includes Mozart's Quartet in C (K. 170), Janacek's Quartet No. 1 and Dvorak's Quartet in A flat. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m. Maverick Concerts, Maverick Road between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., just outside Woodstock. (914) 679-8217. Tickets: $10 to $55 for ''Woodstock Beat,'' which is a benefit for the Woodstock Guild; reservations, (914) 679-2079; $15 ($5 for students) for Sunday's concert (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>MESSIAEN CELEBRATION. Hans Vonk helped open Lincoln Center Festival 2000 last week, conducting the New York Philharmonic in an excellent performance of Messiaen's big and difficult ''Eclairs sur l'Au-Dela.'' Here, to close the festival's Messiaen series, Mr. Vonk leads the orchestra in the composer's ''Turangalila Symphony,'' a work by now better known though hardly less big and difficult. The only thing missing for the first evening was a full house; if more listeners turn out here, a good and festive time should be had by all. Tonight at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 and 35 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>MEREDITH MONK: VOICE TRAVEL. In the first concert in the Lincoln Center Festival 2000 Monk retrospective, ''Solo Landscapes'' on Tuesday, Ms. Monk was everywhere impressive for the amazing flexibility and versatility of her vocal technique, and the imagination with which she applied it in her compositions. Still, it all seemed a bit much of the same thing. More varied angles on Ms. Monk's music are promised here, in ''Expeditions in Concert,'' with other singers and chamber orchestra, tonight, and ''Monk Perspectives,'' with film , on Sunday. (Also see listing under Dance, Lincoln Center Festival, below.) Tonight at 8, Alice Tully Hall, and Sunday night at 8, La Guardia High School Concert Hall, Amsterdam Avenue at 65th Street, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $38 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY. Among the many offspring of the Mostly Mozart Festival is this orchestra's three-week Amadeus Festival, now in its sixth year. Its program this weekend, to be conducted by the orchestra's music director, Zdenek Macal, includes the Overture to ''Don Giovanni,'' the Symphony No. 15 (K. 124), the Sinfonia Concertante in E flat (K. 297b), and the ''Turkish'' Violin Concerto (K. 219) with Pamela Frank as the soloist. Tonight at 8, Richardson Auditorium, Princeton; tomorrow at 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark. (800) 255-3476. Tickets: $15 to $40 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>NORFOLK CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL. The Yale Summer School of Music retreats north to this lovely spot, and the public reaps much of the benefit at concerts in the quaint Music Shed. This weekend the festival commemorates the 250th anniversary of Bach's death. Tonight, the fine harpsichordist Kenneth Cooper, the Tokyo String Quartet and others perform all six ''Brandenburg'' Concertos. Tomorrow, Richard Lalli, a baritone, sings the familiar cantata ''Ich Habe Genug,'' and other performers, including the guitarist Eliot Fisk, join in instrumental works. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, Routes 44 and 272, Norfolk, Conn., (860) 542-3000. Tickets: $12 to $30; $5 for ages 18 to 25; free to those under 18 with paying adult (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>RUTGERS SUMMERFEST. Typically, this wide-ranging festival veers from one musical style or genre to another: in this case, from a solo piano recital by Christopher O'Riley tonight to an orchestral program tomorrow. There, Richard Auldon Clark conducts the Rutgers Festival Orchestra in a program of French works: Berlioz's ''Mort de Cleopatre,'' with the soprano Faith Esham, Debussy's ''Apres-Midi d'un Faune'' and Ibert's ''Escales.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Nicholas Music Center at Douglass College, off Route 18, New Brunswick, N.J., (732) 932-7511. Tickets: $20; $10 for those 12 and younger (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>TANGLEWOOD. The Boston Symphony plays three different programs this weekend, with three different conductors. Tonight at 8:30 Jeffrey Tate leads the orchestra in Wagner's ''Siegfried Idyll,'' Haydn's Symphony No. 99 and Schumann's Piano Concerto, with the exciting Helene Grimaud. Tomorrow, also at 8:30, comes more Wagner -- the overture to ''The Flying Dutchman'' and preludes from Acts III and I of ''Die Meistersinger'' -- along with Schoenberg's ''Transfigured Night'' and Mozart's ''Exsultate, jubilate,'' which will be odd in this hyper-Romantic context but surely cherishable, with Barbara Bonney singing. James Conlon conducts. Then on Sunday afternoon, at 2:30, Seiji Ozawa is the conductor for the weekend's high point: Peter Lieberson's much anticipated second piano concerto ''Red Garuda,'' written for Peter Serkin. Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony completes the program. Tanglewood, Koussevitzky Music Shed, Lenox, Mass., (413) 637-5165. Tickets: $14 (lawn) to $76 (Paul Griffiths).</p>
