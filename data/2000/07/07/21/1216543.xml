        <p>Of the many locations Japan considered for the annual summit meeting of the world's leading industrialized nations, this resort town in the country's southernmost island, Okinawa, seemed a most dubious choice.</p>
        <p>Okinawa, a backwater province plagued by a tragic past, lacked the infrastructure and know-how needed to mount an international event of such magnitude. Relations between Tokyo and the former island kingdom have never been good, and the islanders have long demanded the removal of the vast American military bases that constrict their lives.</p>
        <p>In the past, meetings of the leading industrial nations in Japan have been held in Tokyo. But the late Prime Minister Keichi Obuchi, who died of a stroke in May, insisted on staging this meeting here, hoping to bolster Okinawa's weak economy and make some amends for decades of abuse and neglect by Japan and the United States.</p>
        <p>With the Group of 8 meeting opening today, many Japanese and American officials are regretting Mr. Obuchi's well-intentioned choice and fretting about the potential for mishap and mayhem in what is ostensibly a sun-drenched paradise.</p>
        <p>''I guess you can say that we are all on pins and needles,'' said a Japanese official. ''Although we feel ready for the summit, there is a sinking feeling in our stomachs that it will either go off without a hitch or there could be great chaos.''</p>
        <p>To the unknowing eye, Okinawa is a haven: a subtropical slice of striking beauty, rich in coral reefs, lush forests, pristine beaches and blue-green waters.</p>
        <p>But trouble lurks not far beneath this shimmering surface. The recent arrest of a United States marine accused of molesting a sleeping Okinawan schoolgirl has heightened outrage among islanders who have vowed to disrupt the summit meeting with massive demonstrations. Today, about 27,000 angry people formed a human chain around United States' Kadena Air Base to protest the presence of American troops on the island -- a major embarrassment to the decorous host nation.</p>
        <p>President Clinton is the first American president to visit Okinawa since it reverted back to Japan from the United States military in 1972. Later today, the president is scheduled to make a major speech at the peace monument on this island, which at the end of World War II was the scene of fierce fighting between the United States and Japanese troops in which nearly one-third of Okinawa's population was killed.</p>
        <p>Japanese security forces, which have deployed 22,000 officers from across the country to Okinawa, are bracing for a possible repeat of the violence that erupted during international trade meetings in the United States in the past year.</p>
        <p>And the meeting's organizers have expressed fear that Okinawa, Japan's poorest and least-developed prefecture, cannot handle the thousands of foreigners who are expected to attend the conference. Forecasts of nightmare traffic, power and telephone failures, overbooked hotels, and seasonal typhoons abound.</p>
        <p>Before Japan annexed Okinawa in the early 1600's, the island was the seat of the Ryukyu Kingdom, which was closely linked to China and had diplomatic and trade ties with Korea and Southeast Asia. Because of their multicultural links, Okinawans have their own art forms, dialect, cuisine and way of life that are distinct from the homogeneous rest of Japan.</p>
        <p>''It's the door to Asia for Japan,'' said Ryu Yamazaki, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. ''We wanted to introduce the world to this unique culture which is part of Japan.''</p>
        <p>The islands, which have a population of 1.2 million, are home to about half of the 45,000 United States military personnel in Japan. Okinawans maintain that they bear an unfair burden because their island, which is less than 1 percent of Japan's total area, contains 75 percent of the United States military facilities in the country.</p>
        <p>The island also has its share of social problems. Okinawa's unemployment rate is twice the national average. It has Japan's lowest household savings rate and lowest per-capita income, and highest teenage pregnancy and divorce rates.</p>
        <p>One reason to bring the meeting here was to persuade islanders to accept a much-disputed plan to construct a new United States Marine Corps helicopter base off the coast of Nago. The new heliport will replace the Futenma Air Base, which is set to be returned to Japan.</p>
        <p>While Okinawans welcomed the closing of the old air station, which was a major nuisance to local residents, they adamantly oppose a new American military base. But the allure of acting as host to the summit meeting, with its economic benefits, proved sufficient to help persuade local Okinawan officials to accept the relocation plan.</p>
        <p>''One cannot deny the political benefits of putting the summit in Okinawa,'' said Yukio Okamoto, a former Foreign Ministry official who served as an adviser to past Japanese governments on the Okinawa issue.</p>
        <p>''However, the main reason was to bring a new era of thinking to the Okinawa mentality,'' Mr. Okamoto said. ''Okinawa has been shackled by past history and unable to move forward like the rest of Japan. Mr. Obuchi thought the summit would be a very important turning point in the island's history.''</p>
        <p>Many Okinawans have mixed feelings: They are delighted that the conference will focus worldwide attention on them and their culture, but are worried that the meeting will be seen as a quick fix for their longstanding problems.</p>
        <p>Although the islanders' dislike of the American bases is clear, many expressed great pride that the three-day conference has come to town.</p>
        <p>''After the summit Okinawa will no longer be a question on 'Jeopardy,' '' said Noriko Takada, a convenience store clerk. ''The world will know us.''</p>
        <p>Across the island, government offices, businesses, private homes and taxi cabs are displaying the flags of the eight nations attending the meeting. The central government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to construct new conference halls, widen roads, refurbish parks and install new telephone lines.</p>
        <p>''It's a great thing for world leaders to come here and learn about the Okinawan reality,'' said Yashikazu Tamaki, an Okinawan assemblyman. ''It's good for Okinawan children because it will give them a sense of pride and encouragement.''</p>
        <p>''But I am worried that leaders like President Clinton will come to Okinawa and make a speech thanking Okinawans for accepting the military bases,'' Mr. Tamaki said. ''That would be like rubbing salt into the wounds of Okinawans, because the reality is, we don't want the bases.''</p>
