        <p>Raymond Flowers goes for the ball, showing all the moves of Charles Barkley.</p>
        <p>But Raymond, 12, is not playing basketball.</p>
        <p>He's playing squash. Urban squash.</p>
        <p>Joshua Bayne-Clarke, 11, has gotten used to the questions from his friends who think squash is only a vegetable. ''They say, 'What's squash?' '' he said, sweating after a match. Joshua gives them a simple answer: ''It's a racket. You hit a ball on the wall with it.''</p>
        <p>Raymond and Joshua are among two dozen children from Harlem who are part of a new twist on an old concept: using sports as a hook to motivate students from poor neighborhoods, improve their academic performance, build character and self-esteem and expose them to the world outside their communities.</p>
        <p>The program, called StreetSquash, was adapted from one in Boston by George Polsky, 31, a former high school and middle school teacher who grew up in New York City and played on the varsity squash team at Harvard.</p>
        <p>Instead of chasing hoop dreams, two dozen 11- to 13-year-olds, half boys and half girls, from two Harlem middle schools, Roberto Clemente and Thurgood Marshall Academy, spend two days a week sharpening their squash skills on some rather select courts: at the Harvard Club of New York or in a gymnasium on the campus of Columbia.</p>
        <p>It is, Mr. Polsky conceded, an unusual sight: minority youngsters toting rackets to the courts to play what Mr. Polsky calls a traditionally ''white upper-class male sport.''</p>
        <p>Maybe in the United States, but some of the best squash players in the world today come from places like Pakistan and Egypt. And now nearly all the newest players in StreetSquash are black or Hispanic.</p>
        <p>''A lot of these kids have never been outside Harlem,'' Mr. Polsky said. ''I believe in people being able to maximize their potential.''</p>
        <p>Last fall, after raising about $100,000 to start StreetSquash and securing the donations of rackets, balls and court shoes, he approached the two schools. More than 75 children tried out for 24 slots.</p>
        <p>Mr. Polsky requires at least a ''B-average effort'' from all his students, and attendance is mandatory at all StreetSquash practices and events, including some community service. The program requires that children sign a contract, and next year, parents will have to agree to spend at least 30 minutes a night doing homework with their children.</p>
        <p>During the school year, Mr. Polsky and his staff meet the children at their schools at the end of the school day and catch the subway together to practice. Each child spends about 90 minutes doing homework and another 90 minutes practicing the game. Participants sign up for three years in the program, and get to practice during the summer as well.</p>
        <p>Throughout the year, staff members monitor the players' grades and their overall progress.</p>
        <p>''Some of the kids are very serious,'' said Joy Rivera, assistant director. ''They're already talking about they want to be mentors for the next class.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Polsky says he has already seen an improvement in grades.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to sit here and take all the credit, but I do think we did something to add to the progress that kids made,'' Mr. Polsky said.</p>
        <p>Raymond's grades rose, then fell at the end of the year. Both he and Mr. Polsky say that means there is still work to do, off the court.</p>
        <p>The Boston program, called SquashBusters,  was begun about five years ago by Greg Zaff, a friend of Mr. Polsky. Mr. Zaff's idea for an urban squash team was simple: roll out the rackets and balls and use a daily dose of squash and after-school tutoring and mentor relationships in the schools, said Christopher Lynch, director of the Boston program.</p>
        <p>''Squash is a great sport, but it has all of the elitist trappings that are associated with it,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''The fact that nobody had done it before was really appealing. I think tennis in the early mid-70's was the same. I'm not sure that squash is ever going to get to the point that tennis is, but squash can help a lot of kids.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Polsky thinks so too. ''Even though it's squash, the primary purpose is academics,'' he said. ''It's made much easier if you can hook them on something they want to do. In my mind, it could have been anything.''</p>
        <p>Checkers, for instance. Or chess or basketball. But squash?</p>
        <p>''I think it's really good because we have so much fun,'' Altagracia Correa, 12, said. ''I feel like, really into this. I used to not beat the boys, and now I do. It has changed my attitude.''</p>
        <p>Jhenny Romero, also 12, said: ''Before I started playing, I'd never heard of it before. I'd only heard of racquetball and not squash. When I heard of it, I thought you'd run after a ball or you maybe thumped a ball or something, because of the name, squash.''</p>
        <p>Early on, Jhenny said she had a few problems learning to serve properly. The ball seldom reached the front wall and seldom landed above the red line. In fact, the balls went everywhere else -- on the ceiling, on the side wall -- until she finally figured it out.</p>
        <p>''I had to give a little umph to it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Throughout the year, the StreetSquash team squares off against the Boston SquashBusters. In six team matches, StreetSquash is 4-2.</p>
