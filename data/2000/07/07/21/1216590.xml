        <p>A 14-year-old girl drowned in the ocean trying to save her 3-year-old half-sister yesterday after the wake of a large boat swept the younger girl off a jetty in Staten Island, her family said. The younger sister was also critically injured.</p>
        <p>The girls, Tina Johnson, 14, and Kristie Terlizzi, 3, were sitting on the rock jetty at Crooke's Point, a fishing spot in Great Kills Park, watching Kristie's father fish around 12:30 p.m., when the wave swept Kristie out, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Tina jumped in and tried to save the younger girl, but soon found herself floundering, an uncle, Allen Blanchard, said last night. Then Kristie's father, Richard Terlizzi, 35, tried to save both girls, but he too was overwhelmed in the choppy water, said Sgt. Jim Foley, a New York Police Department spokesman.</p>
        <p>Three people in a small motorboat managed to save Kristie and her father, the police said.</p>
        <p>One of the boaters, Ray Conner, scooped the younger girl up in a fishing net, the owner of the boat, Steve Clohessy, said. ''She was floating face down in the water,'' said Mr. Clohessy, who gave the girl C.P.R. Then Mr. Clohessy's 14-year-old son, Joseph, held the net out to Mr. Terlizzi and pulled him back to shore behind the boat, Mr. Clohessy said.</p>
        <p>But Tina was nowhere to be found  But Tina was nowhere to be found.</p>
        <p>After an hour and a half of searching, a Fire Department scuba diver found her 75 feet offshore and 10 feet underwater, the Fire Department said. She died at Staten Island University Hospital a short time later.</p>
        <p>Kristie was in critical but stable condition at the hospital, officials said. Her family said she was on a respirator. Mr. Terlizzi was treated for hypothermia and discharged.</p>
        <p>The death of Tina, a blonde-haired, mocha-skinned girl who resembled Mariah Carey, wrote poetry and wanted to be a pediatrician (though she worked part-time as a supermarket bagger), devastated not just her family but seemingly her whole neighborhood on Richmond Terrace in Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Other teenagers filed in and out of the family's house or sat on their stoops, their eyes brimming with tears.</p>
        <p>Later in the evening, Tina's best friend, Susan Bardsley, and Susan's mother began making the rounds of local delis and pizzerias, leaving milk jugs with Tina's picture at the counter, looking for donations to raise money for her funeral.</p>
