        <p>HAS your car left you up the creek without a paddle? If you had an Amphicar, you'd simply float back to shore. Or you could relax, catch some rays and have a cool drink after you drop the anchor. (What? Your car doesn't have an anchor?)</p>
        <p>Both the anchor and the paddle were options on the Amphicar, built in 1961-68 by IWK in West Germany. Sales brochures described it as ''the car that swims.''</p>
        <p>The Amphicar's origins are misty. Some think it was designed to let commuters avoid traffic by diving into the canals of Northern Europe. But of the 3,700 built, more than 3,000 came to the United States, where they were promoted as dual-purpose recreational vehicles.</p>
        <p>The car was powered by an 1,147-cubic-centimeter, 43-horsepower engine built by Triumph of England. The engine was mounted in a watertight compartment at the rear. There were separate transmissions for land and water; a conventional floor shifter worked the four-speed manual (with internal parts by Porsche) that was used on terra firma. A nearby lever activated the two nylon propellers at the rear.</p>
        <p>As one might expect, these odd ducks appeal to collectors with a sense of humor and an adventurous streak. In 1965, two Amphicars made news by crossing the English Channel. One stalled halfway over after a bilge-pump failure let water into the engine compartment; that car was towed by the other to France, where they were met on the beach by surprised customs officials.</p>
        <p>Hugh Gordon, 60, of La Habra, Calif., recalled driving an Amphicar from Detroit to Mexico in his college days. He took it into the sea to Cozumel, he said, but the engine stopped running when his bilge pump failed. ''We drifted for two days and landed on a deserted island,'' he said. A tugboat eventually came to the rescue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon has also crossed Lake Michigan. Compared with boats that bob atop the waves, the Amphicar ''goes through the waves rather than over them,'' he said. ''It's a little like being in a submarine.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon's experience did not sour him on Amphicars. He now owns Gordon Imports, the primary supplier of parts worldwide. He also makes replacement parts.</p>
        <p>Launching an Amphicar requires some forethought, as the steel-bodied car would quickly sink if not properly sealed. Before taking the plunge, the driver must lock the doors with a lever that makes them watertight. (Oversized rubber seals, similar to those on a refrigerator, are available to prevent what owners refer to as ''door dribble.'') The door lock also prevents distracted passengers from opening a door while in the water, which has an immediate, negative effect on the car's buoyancy.</p>
        <p>But most important is the drain plug for the bilge and engine compartment, which must be tightly secured. Owners tell a story, perhaps apocryphal, about a German owner who proudly drove his new Amphicar into a river but forgot to secure the plug. The car quickly settled to the bottom.</p>
        <p>''It's a little scary the first time you go down the boat ramp,'' said Jeff Sweet of Gloversville, N.Y., president of the International Amphicar Club. ''You get that feeling like, 'Is this going to work?' It seems like the nose is going in the water a long ways before it picks up and starts to float.''</p>
        <p>Then the driver shifts the water-drive lever to the forward-propellers position and the car swims away. The front wheels act as twin rudders; the steering wheel is used in the usual manner. As with most boats, there is no need to shift in the water; the accelerator controls the speed.</p>
        <p>As in a boat, there are no brakes. Marc Schlemmer, 32, an Amphicar owner in Hebron, Ky., said, ''The most common thing every Amphicar owner has done, and is embarrassed to admit, is they push the brake pedal while they're in the water.''</p>
        <p>When new, the Amphicar reached 75 miles an hour on land and 8 on the water. ''But it's no fun to go boating with the engine revved that loud,'' Mr. Sweet said. ''Five miles an hour is cruising speed.'' Performance on land is leisurely, too: 43 seconds from zero to 60 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schlemmer described how it feels to set sail: ''It's very unnatural to be sitting in the water in a car. You have your left arm on the window sill. You're looking in the rearview mirror. You're driving. You feel low in the water. You're sitting at about water level. Your feet are below water level. You can easily drape your arm over the door and drag it in the water.''</p>
        <p>Handling, on sea or land, was never the Amphicar's forte. In a 60's road test, the vehicle was described as ''not a very good car, and not a very good boat either.''</p>
        <p>''It's sort of like driving a helium balloon,'' said Billy Syx, who operates East Coast Amphicar, a restoration and repair shop in Mays Landing, N.J. ''The cars weigh 2,200 pounds, have 10 inches of ground clearance, a short wheelbase and narrow track.''</p>
        <p>If only the Amphicar moved fast enough, it could be a car, a boat and a plane. Because of its high, blunt front end, it catches the wind at highway speeds. This trait, combined with the engine's weight at the rear, tends to make the front lift up. The steering can become quite vague.</p>
        <p>But the mere fact that the Amphicar covered both surf and turf set it apart, and it has a cult following. Mr. Sweet's club has some 250 members in 13 countries. Besides its Web address, www.amphicar.com, other sites include www.amphicars.com and www.amphicar.net.</p>
        <p>The seventh-annual Amphicar Swim In, held by the club and organized by Mr. Schlemmer, will be July 28-30 in Celina, Ohio, as part of the Celina Lake Festival. About 40 cars are registered; they will parade through town and plunge into Grand Lake St. Marys for a group swim.</p>
        <p>''I've always loved cars and boats, so it made sense that I would own an Amphicar,'' said Rick Young, of Murfreesboro, Tenn. In 1970, Mr. Young's father purchased a second-hand Amphicar for $600. ''He used to fish out of it,'' Mr. Young said. Today, he and his father own three Amphicars, which they take for cruises on the Stones River in Tennessee. ''It's very relaxing,'' Mr. Young said. ''I would compare it to golf.''</p>
        <p>Some government agencies classify the Amphicar as both boat and car. Mr. Schlemmer has two titles for his '65 model; it wears auto license plates as well as boat registration numbers on the front fender.</p>
        <p>Complying with contemporary nautical regulations, Amphicars have red and green lights on a chromed pod on the hood, with a white light in the rear. When new, Amphicars offered options like the anchor ($12.95), anchor cleats ($10.85) and a marine kit consisting of a fire extinguisher, floating cushions, flares and a paddle ($49.25). The car had a list price of $3,395 in 1961, or about $20,000 in today's dollars. Increasingly strict safety and emissions regulations, for cars and boats, contributed to the car's demise.</p>
        <p>As one might expect of a steel-body car immersed in water -- often salt water -- the maintenance needs are high, like those of a car and a boat combined. In water, the steering mechanism, driveshaft and brakes are submerged. Frequent lubrication is necessary; there are nearly 30 grease fittings on the steering and suspension.</p>
        <p>The Amphicar is not the only wheeled beast in the water. Among a number of amphibious military vehicles, the German-built Schwimmwagen (of World War II vintage) is the most carlike and coveted by collectors. Currently, Dutton Marine in Worthing, England, produces amphibious cars that use mechanical parts from Ford Fiestas and Suzuki Samurais.</p>
        <p>While prices of pristine Amphicars can top $35,000, ''a car that's been restored, that's in nice condition, that swims good and runs good, is worth $18,000,'' Mr. Schlemmer said. ''If it runs at all, it's worth $10,000. Anything that swims at all is $12,000.''</p>
        <p>That is roughly equivalent to the price of a vintage MGB sports car. Since both are convertibles, either would be at home on a topless beach. But only the Amphicar would dare to venture into the waves.</p>
