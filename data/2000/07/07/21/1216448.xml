        <p>It is not all that hard to imagine the genesis of Bill T. Jones's new ''You Walk?,'' performed on Wednesday night at La Guardia Concert Hall as part of the Lincoln Center Festival. Mr. Jones is not only a passionate and intelligent modern-dance choreographer but hot as well, the commissioning city of Bologna might have reasoned. What better addition to the festivities for its European City of Culture 2000 designation? At the same time, most dance companies have never met a commission they didn't like. And who would want to pass up a gig in Italy?</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jones should perhaps have hesitated at the amorphous theme he was given: to create a dance about ''the influence of Latin culture on the New World,'' as he puts it in program notes. The full-evening work opens and closes with a pretty, mysterious stage picture, a star-dappled skyscape layered with gauzy screens and punctuated with silhouetted bodies. Some of Mr. Jones's wide-ranging musical choices -- 11 compositions for this suite of 11 flowing scenes -- are intriguing, among them the Zambian child's song-chant that opens the piece, an extended rumbling gargle by John Cage and some Portuguese fado and medieval Spanish dance music.</p>

        <p>It is not all that hard to imagine the genesis of Bill T. Jones's new ''You Walk?,'' performed on Wednesday night at La Guardia Concert Hall as part of the Lincoln Center Festival. Mr. Jones is not only a passionate and intelligent modern-dance choreographer but hot as well, the commissioning city of Bologna might have reasoned. What better addition to the festivities for its European City of Culture 2000 designation? At the same time, most dance companies have never met a commission they didn't like. And who would want to pass up a gig in Italy?</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jones should perhaps have hesitated at the amorphous theme he was given: to create a dance about ''the influence of Latin culture on the New World,'' as he puts it in program notes. The full-evening work opens and closes with a pretty, mysterious stage picture, a star-dappled skyscape layered with gauzy screens and punctuated with silhouetted bodies. Some of Mr. Jones's wide-ranging musical choices -- 11 compositions for this suite of 11 flowing scenes -- are intriguing, among them the Zambian child's song-chant that opens the piece, an extended rumbling gargle by John Cage and some Portuguese fado and medieval Spanish dance music.</p>
        <p>One can tell where Mr. Jones is headed by looking at these musical choices, which also include a contemporary Brazilian version of Gregorian chant and a ''lost'' 18th-century opera by Domenico Zipoli, a Jesuit missionary to the Amazon. But the opera, ''San Ignacio,'' sounds simply like somewhat unsophisticated 18th-century opera writing.</p>
        <p>Some in the audience saw a gradual progression to acculturation in the goings-on. The piece does skitter across the surfaces of several seeming cultural and social themes, at times comically, as when a man with a black rubber hood that suggests both the Spanish Inquisition and a sadomasochistic frolic seems to be coming on to a blank-faced stand-in for a blank-slate Native. That certainly would be a way to suggest a conquering culture's effect on an indigenous society, but it is unclear that this is Mr. Jones's point.</p>
        <p>Little takes root in the piece. Mr. Jones draws on a wide dance vocabulary but only incidentally, so that steps and moves in different idioms often appear arbitrary and without even the logic of illogic. The intense, idiosyncratic Mr. Jones can make something of the kind of desultory moves and gestures he puts on stage here. But the choreography, which also includes a good deal of aimless-seeming tearing around and some mostly vitiated-looking set pieces, doesn't give Mr. Jones's 10 fine dancers much to do.</p>
        <p>In his program notes, Mr. Jones describes ''You Walk?'' as ''a poetic response to a social and political topic'' in which he strove to steer clear of polemics. But nearly all Mr. Jones's pieces are informed by a point of view, however abstract the choreography may be, and one misses his hard, sharp, polemical self here. The kind of intellectual hide-and-seek typified in the title ''You Walk?,'' once beloved of downtown dance ironicists, is tiresome.</p>
        <p>Janet Wong contributed the choreography for the ''Small House, Dream Speak'' section. The lighting was by Robert Wierzel, the sets by Bjorn G. Amelan. Paul Kaiser created the digital projections, which included the magical free fall through deep space of the letters that formed the title ''Choosing Free Fall.'' ''You Walk?'' will be performed again tonight and tomorrow at La Guardia Concert Hall, West 65th Street at Tenth Avenue.</p>
