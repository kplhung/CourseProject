        <p>Has there ever been a presidential campaign headquarters more boring than George W. Bush's? The Bush people don't have staff shake-ups. They haven't had to move the offices so the candidate could find himself. They don't even spend their days gossiping on the phone or backbiting their superiors.</p>
        <p>The fact is they are grinds. The atmosphere in Austin is dull and professional, according to people who spend a lot of time there. The offices look like they belong to a corporate law firm, and the Bushies squirrel away in their cubicles from dawn till dark. They operate like a White House in waiting, with sophisticated paper routing, West Wing-style briefings, and multilayered speech vetting. One gets the impression that if they ever did have a late night pizza bash, they'd use knives, forks and cloth napkins.</p>

        <p>Has there ever been a presidential campaign headquarters more boring than George W. Bush's? The Bush people don't have staff shake-ups. They haven't had to move the offices so the candidate could find himself. They don't even spend their days gossiping on the phone or backbiting their superiors.</p>
        <p>The fact is they are grinds. The atmosphere in Austin is dull and professional, according to people who spend a lot of time there. The offices look like they belong to a corporate law firm, and the Bushies squirrel away in their cubicles from dawn till dark. They operate like a White House in waiting, with sophisticated paper routing, West Wing-style briefings, and multilayered speech vetting. One gets the impression that if they ever did have a late night pizza bash, they'd use knives, forks and cloth napkins.</p>
        <p>This is a long way from the war room atmosphere of the Clinton crowd in 1992, when you had twentysomething know-it-alls who had never mentally left the college dorm and Carville-like gurus going gonzo. In fact, this is a long way from most presidential campaigns, especially those trying to oust an incumbent party that has been in office for eight years. At this point in the political cycle, we're normally due for an insurgency.</p>
        <p>The 1960 election brought us the fresh blood of the Kennedy crowd after eight years of Ike. In 1976, Jimmy Carter's outsider campaign promised a break from the scandals of Watergate. In 1980, Ronald Reagan led his own insurgency, staffed by movement conservatives -- some so fresh off the farm they wore white socks with their suits -- vowing to sweep out the stables. Twelve years later came the Clintonites -- baby boomer Rhodes scholars presenting their generation as God's gift to government.</p>
        <p>But this season there are no outsiders. The Bush campaign is about as insurgent as General Electric or I.B.M. If the Bushies win, they can cancel the White House orientation because everybody will have already worked there. The foreign policy team is like a Desert Storm reunion tour: Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Paul Wolfowitz and Robert Zoellick all worked for President George Bush. One exception is Richard Perle, and he worked in the Reagan administration. On the domestic side are prominent Bush administration alumni like Lawrence Lindsey, Josh Bolton and Michael Boskin. The Bush campaign looks as much like an incumbent campaign as the Gore one. Measured by governing experience, the edge actually goes to the G.O.P.</p>
        <p>It was not long ago that the Republicans were neck-deep in populism. In the Gingrich era, this was the party of term limits. But now the G.O.P. is enthusiastic about a campaign of seasoned veterans. This really does represent a Risorgimento of the establishment. From the 1970's to the 1990's, the New Right adopted some of the mindset of the New Left. It was better to be an anti-establishment rebel than an insider or a member of the mainstream. It was cool to call yourself a radical and a revolutionary. But since the Gingrich revolution flamed out, the establishmentarians have reasserted themselves. They saw George W. Bush as their vehicle for retaking their party. They chose him as much as he gathered them.</p>
        <p>So now we have a situation in which the challenger looks like a steadier hand than the sitting vice president. Even as Mr. Bush has been getting gravitas implants from the G.O.P. elder statesmen, Al Gore has adopted the pose of a protean outsider, first moving his headquarters to Nashville from Washington and then posing as a populist to counter the challenge of Ralph Nader. Worse, whereas Mr. Bush has accumulated the 1927 Yankees of foreign policy advisers, Gore  relies on one person, a semi-obscure aide named Leon Fuerth. Whereas Bush stands at the head of a phalanx of sober experts, corporate buddies and G.O.P. bigwigs, Gore keeps his own counsel.</p>
        <p>There may not be much romance in the Bush campaign. There will be no ''bliss to be alive'' moments. But after a few decades of anti-establishment rhetoric, a little prosaic dullness may fit the national mood.</p>
