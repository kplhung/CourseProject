        <p>The largest rail merger in North American history was formally scrapped yesterday, as the railroads involved complained about regulatory interference and shippers remained convinced that they had not seen the end of the consolidation that has so far left just a handful of major freight railroads to serve the United States and Canada.</p>
        <p>The boards of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation and the Canadian National Railway voted to end an agreement to combine the two companies into one huge transcontinental system running from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to the Mexican border and up to the Alaskan frontier.</p>
        <p>Executives of the two railroads said that the decision by the Surface Transportation Board to hold up all mergers for 15 months while new guidelines were issued had made going ahead with the plan too risky.</p>
        <p>''The delay and uncertainty caused by the S.T.B.'s moratorium and proposed rule-making made it impossible for us to continue with our combination efforts,'' Paul M. Tellier, president of Canadian National, said in a statement issued by both railroads.</p>
        <p>The moratorium is to last until next June. Merger applications typically take more than a year to be considered by the federal regulatory board, which would mean that the two railroads would be prohibited from merging for more than two years, a period they say is too long.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tellier and his counterpart at Burlington Northern, Robert D. Krebs, said they would work to better coordinate the operations of the two carriers as fully as possible without a formal merger. They said no break-up fees would be assessed because both companies had decided to end the merger plan.</p>
        <p>Despite the termination of the Burlington Northern-Canadian National proposal, shippers believe that the major railroads remain intent on going ahead with mergers until there are just two major rail systems left in North America. With previous mergers, there are five major railroads now operating in the United States and two in Canada.</p>
        <p>''The railroads have really showed their hands as far as what they view the endgame being,'' said Diane C. Duff, executive director of the Alliance for Rail Competition, which represents the coal and chemical industries as well as other bulk shippers. ''Mergers seem to be the only way they know how to 'get efficiencies.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Duff said American regulators now have a chance to ''make a sea change in the way they've approached the rail industry.'' Shippers complain that the Surface Transportation Board has favored the railroads and sometimes failed to adequately promote real competition.</p>
        <p>The last few big rail mergers caused major service disruptions that cost manufacturers and shippers millions of dollars in lost business. The Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific joined together in 1996, and last year the Norfolk Southern and the CSX each acquired a portion of the Conrail system. Both deals resulted in bigger carriers, but less competition.</p>
        <p>Shippers reacted angrily when Canadian National and Burlington Northern announced their planned combination in December, and by March the regulators called a halt to all mergers until new rules could be drawn up. The two railroads thought that the board had overstepped its authority, but their legal challenge was overturned last week by a federal court.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Surface Transportation Board said they have already begun to receive comments from shippers and railroads on what the new merger guidelines should look like. The issues to be covered include such basic ones as relieving bottlenecks and providing access to terminal areas. A controversial matter is expected to be the so-called captive shippers, which are manufacturing plants on routes served by only one rail line.</p>
        <p>Randy Speight, head of the distribution team at the American Chemistry Council, an industry group, said the chemical producers are particularly vulnerable to the lack of rail competition because 63 percent of the nation's chemical plants and warehouses are already captive to a single railroad.</p>
        <p>''We've got to do something to make sure that future mergers don't result in the same costly service problems that we experienced in past mergers,'' Mr. Speight said.</p>
        <p>Besides trying to shape the new merger regulations, the chemical industry will be lobbying Congress intensively to foster competition in the rail industry when the moratorium ends, Mr. Speight said.</p>
        <p>The Surface Transportation Board is scheduled to issue proposed new merger regulations in the first week of October. After a period of public comment, final regulations are to come out in June when the moratorium has ended.</p>
