        <p>'The Poetic Conceit And Other Black Works'  Michael Werner  4 East 77th Street  Manhattan</p>
        <p>Through Sept. 4</p>
        <p>Relentlessly pursuing perfection, the conceptualist James Lee Byars (1932-1997) was a performer and an object maker in the tradition of Duchamp.</p>
        <p>In his youth he studied ceramics and papermaking in Japan, coming under the influence of Zen philosophy and Noh drama. His work ran to austere ''perfect'' shapes of gold, marble, glass and paper, and in his legendary performances he did things like enveloping 100 nude volunteers in a single overall garment of red, and arranging 100 white marbles in an exactly symmetrical pattern on the floor of an all-white room.</p>

        <p>'The Poetic Conceit And Other Black Works'  Michael Werner  4 East 77th Street  Manhattan</p>
        <p>Through Sept. 4</p>
        <p>Relentlessly pursuing perfection, the conceptualist James Lee Byars (1932-1997) was a performer and an object maker in the tradition of Duchamp.</p>
        <p>In his youth he studied ceramics and papermaking in Japan, coming under the influence of Zen philosophy and Noh drama. His work ran to austere ''perfect'' shapes of gold, marble, glass and paper, and in his legendary performances he did things like enveloping 100 nude volunteers in a single overall garment of red, and arranging 100 white marbles in an exactly symmetrical pattern on the floor of an all-white room.</p>
        <p>A dramatic presence, he often appeared in his own performances wearing flowing robes or a gold suit and a black top hat with a black mask. His favorite colors were black, white, gold and red, but this small show is devoted only to works in black.</p>
        <p>The most elaborate is ''The Poetic Conceit'' (1983), a tribute to Goethe.</p>
        <p>A black-and-white copy of the famous portrait by J. H. W. Tischbein, showing the poet reclining on a stone slab in an Italianate landscape littered with classical ruins, appears on a background of draped black cloth. Before it on a black-draped table sits an offering, a round white plate meant to represent the ideals of classicism by a single perfect circle.</p>
        <p>In ''The New Moon'' (1993), Byars arranged seven black crescents cut from silk paper, each covered by a crescent of glass that gives it a silvery edge, in a partial circle on the wall. These ''two-dimensional sculptures,'' as he called them, one lettered with ''moon'' in gold, form a lively scalloped outline on the wall.</p>
        <p>Byars's obsession with mortality is seen in ''The Perfect Death'' (1977), a round, wreathlike wallpiece whose black-glass perimeter, paved with glass leaves and tendrils, has a circle of wrinkled black silk paper stretched over it with the words ''A Perfect Death'' lettered in gold.</p>
        <p>Unlike most artists, Byars made his own presence very much part of his work. Knowing him, it's not at all surprising that his fey anima still inhabits even this small show.</p>
