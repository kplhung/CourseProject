        <p>About 50 parents, teachers and students protested yesterday in front of the Board of Education headquarters, expressing anger that the board had not renewed the contract of a popular district superintendent in south Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Donald Weber, superintendent of District 21 for 17 years, resigned on July 5, five days after his contract expired.

        <p>About 50 parents, teachers and students protested yesterday in front of the Board of Education headquarters, expressing anger that the board had not renewed the contract of a popular district superintendent in south Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Donald Weber, superintendent of District 21 for 17 years, resigned on July 5, five days after his contract expired. According to parents, the district school board approved his new contract and sent it to the Board of Education as early as February, but it was never signed by Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy.</p>
        <p>The district, which encompasses Coney Island, Seagate and Brighton Beach, and parts of Gravesend, Bensonhurst and Sheepshead Bay, has ranked among the city's top six districts in recent years.</p>
        <p>Some said the problem lay in a personality conflict between Mr. Levy and Mr. Weber.</p>
        <p>''As much as he's been a success, Mr. Weber has also been a maverick,'' said Brian L. Gotlieb, a member of the district school board. ''He has his own way of doing things, like giving more responsibility to the teachers.''</p>
        <p>Minutes after the protest began, members of the district's Presidents Council, a group made up of leaders of parent-teacher organizations, were admitted into the chancellor's office for a meeting. When they emerged an hour later, some seemed mollified.</p>
        <p>''This was not political,'' Cheri Rotondi, who heads the Presidents Council, said after the meeting. ''There are seven other contracts that have not been signed as of now.''</p>
        <p>She said Mr. Levy had expressed willingness to meet with Mr. Weber to discuss the contract if Mr. Weber contacted him about it. Mr. Weber is out of the country.</p>
        <p>Pam McDonnell, a Board of Education spokeswoman, said that while Mr. Levy and Mr. Weber had had some ''managerial issues,'' the delay in signing the contract was not personal and that the resignation had surprised the chancellor.</p>
        <p>''There's no hidden agenda here,'' she said.</p>
