        <p>New York State's economy has continued to grow over the last year, with private-sector employment up and unemployment rates down both downstate and upstate, the state's chief economist said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The economist, Stephen Kagann, said that the gains over the last 12 months continued a turnaround in the state's economy that began downstate in 1996 and upstate in 1997. He said that the upstate improvement was often overlooked in discussions of the state's economic situation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kagann said that private employment last month was higher statewide by nearly 160,000 jobs, or 2.3 percent, over June 1999. He said the increase was 2.5 percent downstate -- New York City and its suburbs -- and 1.8 percent upstate. The  national growth rate is 2.2 percent.</p>
        <p>The statewide unemployment rate, seasonally adjusted, ''fell sharply to  4.5 percent in June 2000 from 5.3 percent in June 1999,'' Mr. Kagann said, higher than the current 4 percent rate nationally.</p>
