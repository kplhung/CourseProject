        <p>WASSELL-Ruth. Loving wife of the late Myron. Survived by daughters Emily Kuriloff and Elizabeth Wassell. Services Friday, 9:45 AM at ''The Riverside'', Amsterdam Avenue at 76 Street.</p>
        <p>WASSELL-Ruth B, ACSW. Today, after 50 years, The William Alanson White Institute saddly bids fairwell to Mrs. Ruth Wassell. She received her certificate in applied psychoanalysis from the Institute in 1956 and had been our Chief Psychiatric Social Worker since 1966. Ruth had been the mainstay of White's low-cost clinic, whose reputation for excellence rested on her extraodinary devotion, her clinical acumen, her range of knowledge, and her unflagging generosity of spirit. She served as a model for patients and colleagues alike of how fully life could be lived when embraced with courage, curiosity and love. Joerg Bose, MD, Director, White Institute Charles C. Harrington, PhD President, Board of Trustees</p>
