        <p>YUNGCHEN LHAMO: ''Coming Home'' and LAMA GYURME WITH JEAN-PHILLIPE RYKIEL: ''Rain of Blessings: Vajra Chants'' (Real World). Unfamiliar faiths can be easier to accept when expressed in foreign tongues. The chant-based sacred music of Tibet has helped stimulate American interest in both that country's religion and in its struggle against Chinese dominance. New albums by the expatriates Yungchen Lamo and Lama Gyurme, who share Central Park's Summerstage next Thursday at 7 p.m., communicate Tibetan wisdom -- and defiance -- within soothing New Age electronica.</p>
        <p>Yungchen Lhamo's music is political as well as spiritual. On ''Coming Home,'' she spans artistic borders, aided by the renowned producer Hector Zazou. At times she sounds like Sarah McLachlan or a Hong Kong pop star. Mr. Zazou's settings for her high, melancholy voice incorporate electric guitar, violin, cello and a sample of a Tuvan throat singer. Yet whether singing in English or wordlessly shouting, Ms. Lhamo keeps her focus on the essentially Tibetan themes of compassion and liberation.</p>

        <p>Yungchen Lhamo's music is political as well as spiritual. On ''Coming Home,'' she spans artistic borders, aided by the renowned producer Hector Zazou. At times she sounds like Sarah McLachlan or a Hong Kong pop star. Mr. Zazou's settings for her high, melancholy voice incorporate electric guitar, violin, cello and a sample of a Tuvan throat singer. Yet whether singing in English or wordlessly shouting, Ms. Lhamo keeps her focus on the essentially Tibetan themes of compassion and liberation.</p>
        <p>Lama Gyurme is a monk, and on his second collaboration with the French pianist Jean-Philippe Rykiel, he focuses on Vajra style devotional chanting. Mr. Rykiel surrounds Mr. Gyurme's appealingly homely voice with organ, violin and keyboards, creating a hymnlike tone. Less overtly political than Ms. Lhamo, Mr. Gyurme still eloquently argues for the preservation of Tibet, in a form flexible enough to appeal to the West.</p>
