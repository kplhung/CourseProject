        <p>On the day that Coach Al Groh spoke of wanting to teach young players about what it means to be a Jet, which players they are following and the culture of the team, perhaps he should have added:</p>
        <p>Except you, Anthony Becht.</p>
        <p>The Jets, most certainly, do not want Becht, the tight end they selected with the fourth first-round pick this year, to follow in the recent pock-marked history of Jets tight ends.</p>
        <p>The last time the Jets took a tight end with a first-round draft pick -- Kyle Brady in 1995 -- he ended up in Jacksonville after catching just 30 passes in 1998, his biggest receiving season for the Jets. Last season, Bill Parcells tried to resurrect the career of Eric Green, signing the two-time Pro Bowler. Green had teamed with Vinny Testaverde in Baltimore in 1997 for his best receiving season, with 65 catches. But a neck injury and bad knees limited Green, who had only seven catches in 10 games last season. He was released at the end of the season.</p>
        <p>As center Kevin Mawae put it: ''Tight end has been a dead end position for the last few years. Obviously, there's high expectations.''</p>
        <p>Speaking of Becht, he said: ''For him to fulfill even half of those expectations would probably be better than what we've had.''</p>
        <p>The veteran Fred Baxter -- who frequently tutors Becht during and after practice -- is currently listed with the first team during training camp. But Becht has shown flashes of the versatility and skill the Jets hope will propel him into the starting spot. Lining up with the first team, Becht has made nimble catches along the sideline and over the middle, causing linebacker Bryan Cox to say that Becht moves better and catches the ball better than Brady does. And, at 6 feet 5 inches, 267 pounds, Becht is expected to be a formidable blocker. He is getting daily lessons from linebacker Mo Lewis.</p>
        <p>''You go against Mo Lewis every day, you can't get any better competition,'' Becht said. ''He helps me on every play, every practice. If you're lackadaisical against him, you're not going to do anything. The high school moves don't work against him. If you can do anything good against those guys, it's something to raise your head about. I feel I know what's going on in the offense. What I need now is game experience.''</p>
        <p>Becht admits that he has been trying too hard in practice to do everything on one play. So he has pulled back a bit, concentrating on perfecting his route running. Groh said that Becht's size would allow him to be used as an in-line tight end. ''With a tight end of his size, it gives us potential to set up more power at the point of attack,'' Groh said.</p>
        <p>As Groh conjures up an image of the best tight end he can use, Brady and Green recede into a place in Jets history the team would prefer to hide away.</p>
        <p>''Regardless of how the past is,'' Becht said, ''that's not how I'm going to be or what I'm going to become.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Coach AL GROH declined comment Thursday on the release of the Bengals receiver CARL PICKENS, but Pickens's agent, HADLEY ENGELHARD, said he would contact the Jets on Friday because they are one of about five teams Pickens is interested in playing for. The Jets had expressed interest in Pickens after KEYSHAWN JOHNSON was traded. The Jets would benefit from Pickens's size and experience, but he was a contentious locker room presence in Cincinnati and he is expected to come with a high price tag. Engelhard said he is confident that there are ways to negotiate around the Jets' minuscule salary cap space. He rejected the notion that Pickens would create trouble, saying losing for so many years in Cincinnati took its toll. ''He'll be a leader and he'll be an asset,'' Engelhard said. ''Carl wants to go to a team dedicated to winning.'' Groh has said that he wants to assess the corps of young receivers the Jets have in camp before making any moves . . . The Jets were visited by JOE NAMATH and MARTY LYONS, a member of the Jets' Sack Exchange of the 1980's, Thursday. Namath addressed the team. ''I was thanking them for what they've done, for the fans that love to see the green and white win,'' Namath said. Namath was asked how he would have felt if he were the starting quarterback when Johnson was traded to Tampa Bay. ''I wouldn't be kicking and screaming, but I certainly wouldn't have felt good about it,'' he said.</p>
