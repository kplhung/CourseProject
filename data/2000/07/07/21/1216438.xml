        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Change of Course for Dot-Com Ad's Hudson Voyage'' and ''Ad Barge Veers West to Seek Legal Waters'' (news articles, July 14 and 18): While it was gratifying to see the New York City Buildings Department take action against a floating billboard in the Hudson River, it makes the department's lack of action against illegal billboards on land throughout the city all the more frustrating.</p>
        <p>Scores of billboards have been brought to the department's attention that are illegal because they lack permits, violate zoning or are too close to parks, arterial highways or residential districts. But there has been little or no response from the department.</p>
        <p>For several years the city has promised to introduce tougher new regulations to deal with the proliferation of illegal and inappropriate advertising signage and to protect residential or historic neighborhoods. None have materialized.</p>
        <p>THOMAS K. DUANE  State Senator, 27th District  New York, July 18, 2000</p>
