        <p>After an intensive 10-day search, a homeless man was charged yesterday with using a chunk of concrete to fracture a young woman's skull during a daytime attack in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The man, Bently Louis Grant, 35, was charged with second-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault and criminal possession of a weapon, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grant confessed after being picked up on Wednesday night by three plainclothes officers who spotted him in Park Slope, said Howard Safir, the police commissioner, at a news conference at the 13th Precinct station house yesterday. Mr. Safir said the police had been looking for Mr. Grant, because a witness identified him as the attacker in a photo line-up.</p>
        <p>A police official said that Mr. Grant did not give any motivation for his actions in his confession.</p>
        <p>The arrest of Mr. Grant concludes a manhunt that began on July 9, when Tiffany F. Goldberg, 25, was struck in the back of the head with a chunk of concrete. The attack took place minutes after noon on East 29th Street between Lexington Avenue and Park Avenue South, shortly after Ms. Goldberg left the Marble Collegiate Reformed Church, where she sings in the choir.</p>
        <p>She bled heavily from her skull and was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center. She also suffered two chipped teeth and lacerations when she fell face-first to the sidewalk. But Ms. Goldberg, walked out the next day in high spirits, after saying that her attacker was probably a ''struggling kid'' when he was a child.</p>
        <p>The attack quickly captured the public's attention, partly because it echoed an assault in Midtown last fall in which another woman, Nicole Barrett, was smashed in her skull by a man wielding a paving stone. Paris Drake, a street vendor, was arrested in that case and charged with attempted murder. In both cases, the same image of urban vulnerability resonated with the public and the news media -- a college-educated woman attacked in broad daylight by a man who roamed the streets.</p>
        <p>Neither woman was robbed, but the police said witnesses saw Mr. Grant reaching for Ms. Goldberg's handbag before swinging the concrete chunk.</p>
        <p>After the attack on Ms. Goldberg, the police talked to witnesses and circulated sketches of a man who resembled Mr. Grant. Two police officers who were canvassing homeless people in Murray Hill first came across Mr. Grant around noon on July 13, Mr. Safir said. They brought him into the 13th Precinct, questioned him, took a Polaroid photograph and let him go because they did not have any evidence to indicate he was the attacker.</p>
        <p>But soon afterward, a witness identified Mr. Grant from a photo line-up. Copies of the photograph were given to officers throughout the city. In the Polaroid, Mr. Grant wears a stained white T-shirt and stares to the left of the camera with a haunted, faraway look.</p>
        <p>Three plainclothes officers were patrolling Park Slope in an unmarked car on Wednesday evening when they saw Mr. Grant. He was standing on the busy commercial strip of Seventh Avenue, at Carroll Street, said Sgt. James Dodd, one of the officers.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Dodd said he walked up to Mr. Grant and said, ''Hey Bently, how are you doing?''</p>
        <p>The officer said Mr. Grant responded, ''How do you know me?''</p>
        <p>''I think I know you from last year,'' Sergeant Dodd said. ''What's your last name?''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Grant told the officers his surname, they escorted him into the car.</p>
        <p>A police official at the 13th Precinct said the questioning and eventual confession ''took a lot of hours.'' A witness identified Mr. Grant from a line-up, Commissioner Safir said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grant has no permanent address but frequented the Murray Hill and Park Slope neighborhoods, said Chief Thomas Fahey, a police spokesman. He said that a few homeless men had been brought in by the police and questioned during the 10-day search.</p>
        <p>The police said they did not know whether Mr. Grant had a history of mental illness.</p>
        <p>Computerized records at the Department of Homeless Services show that Mr. Grant spent the night of Feb. 1 in the Bellevue Men's Shelter on First Avenue near East 30th Street, but left the next day. He was one of more than 5,400 men in the city's shelter system that night.</p>
        <p>''A lot of guys have this kind of lodging record,'' said Patrick Markee, director of policy for the Coalition for the Homeless. ''One night in the winter or a handful of nights when it's cold, but no regular contact with the system.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir said that 50 detectives worked on tracking down Ms. Goldberg's assailant. The police offered a $10,000 reward for information in the case. Although dozens of people are assaulted, robbed and shot each week in New York, the police rarely expend the same amount of manpower on tracking down those assailants.</p>
        <p>''This was a high-profile case,'' Mr. Safir said about the use of resources. ''It was a case that the public was concerned about.''</p>
