        <p>Editorial on Metropolitan Museum's exhibit of anonymous amateur photographs collected by Thomas Walther</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Among the small, anonymous photographs hanging in the Gilman Gallery at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, there is a picture of a young boy fielding a ground ball on a rural ball field -- almost a pasture -- somewhere in America in 1931. He has ranged far to his left, the way a shortstop does to cover a ground ball up the middle, and he has stooped so far forward while still keeping a leg under him that it looks as though he is bowing in deep humility to the baseball in his glove. Strangely, it is an image of complete lassitude, a perfect rendering of the weariness that always steals over a game of catch played in a land of bad hops.</p>
        <p>''Other Pictures,'' on display until Aug. 27, is an exhibition of anonymous amateur photographs collected by Thomas Walther. In the commentary surrounding this exhibition, much has naturally been made of the way these photographs echo the work of 20th-century masters like Walker Evans, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Eugene Atget and others. The resemblances reflect the porousness of a popular medium like photography, the effect its ubiquity in magazines and advertising has on anyone who tries to use a camera. The resemblances obviously reflect Mr. Walther's taste as well.</p>

        <p>Among the small, anonymous photographs hanging in the Gilman Gallery at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, there is a picture of a young boy fielding a ground ball on a rural ball field -- almost a pasture -- somewhere in America in 1931. He has ranged far to his left, the way a shortstop does to cover a ground ball up the middle, and he has stooped so far forward while still keeping a leg under him that it looks as though he is bowing in deep humility to the baseball in his glove.

        <p>''Other Pictures,'' on display until Aug. 27, is an exhibition of anonymous amateur photographs collected by Thomas Walther. In the commentary surrounding this exhibition, much has naturally been made of the way these photographs echo the work of 20th-century masters like Walker Evans, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Eugene Atget and others. The resemblances reflect the porousness of a popular medium like photography, the effect its ubiquity in magazines and advertising has on anyone who tries to use a camera. The resemblances obviously reflect Mr. Walther's taste as well.</p>
        <p>Yet these odd visual echoes between the work of anonymous amateurs and famous photographers suggests something important about the camera's nature. It cannot refuse to see what it sees, the way humans can. It has an instrumentality all its own, the power to subvert the work of artists and amateurs alike. These found photographs document many things -- artistic aspirations, erotic proclivities, simple curiosity, a memorial impulse, even the mechanical confusion of operating a camera. They reveal an interesting gap between what the photographer thinks is worth noticing and what the camera actually notices.</p>
        <p>But what ''Other Pictures'' really documents is the surprise that unexpected attention brings. These photos record the luck of the living moment, which any artist will tell you is an inexpressible gift and which you learn to call intention. The photographer looks through a peephole onto life and life looks back, unspeakably strange and dramatic. Walking through this gallery, you realize for an instant just how much photography has radicalized our sense of time and movement, our feel for how we look and act. Shadows cavort in the accidental light, another life hidden within the one we call our own.</p>
