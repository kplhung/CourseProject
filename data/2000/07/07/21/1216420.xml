        <p>Mahesh Dattani's play ''Dance Like a Man'' opens with a young dancer, Lata, bringing her fiance, Viswas, home to meet her parents. Their hopes, and the family histories that emerge from their conversation, are quietly amusing, and the missteps and misunderstandings that trip up everyone when Lata's parents return to the house are very funny. It is also somehow reassuring to know that families on the other side of the globe are as fractious and occasionally dysfunctional as our own.</p>
        <p>But be wary. This play deals with the recent, and ancient, history of India in personal terms, probing three generations of conflict against a background that evokes the highest achievements of ancient Sanskrit theater and classical religious dance. Some of the turns in this story are harrowing, and the bitterness of the characters can be deeply unsettling.</p>
        <p>The play is one of two being presented at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center by the Indo-American Arts Council of New York in what it hopes will be a series of festivals of Indian theater. The other play in this year's program is ''Once Upon a Fleeting Bird'' by Vijay Tendulkar, who has built an international reputation by a lifetime of political provocation as well as by his work in theater.</p>
        <p>In ''Dance Like a Man'' Jairaj and Ratna, a couple who have been Bharatanatyam dancers since youth, but not spectacularly successful ones -- ''we lacked the brilliance and magic to dance like gods,'' they confess sorrowfully at the end -- place all their hopes on the imminent dancing debut of Lata, whose career promises to be outstanding. But as the story develops, Ratna reveals a deep jealousy of her daughter and an almost imperious contempt for her husband. His life, in turn, was disastrously distorted by his rebellion against a father who was deeply opposed to the son's cultivation of ancient religious and artistic disciplines represented by the dance to which he and Ratna were dedicated, and by the death of their first child.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dattani is a canny and facile writer, and there is nothing in all this that is alien to an American audience. The personal conflicts are dramatic and powerful. But gradually,  behind the children, parents and grandparents in this bourgeois family, a viewer sees the secular state-building generation of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru; the next generation, whose pursuit of religious values that were relegated by government to the private sphere has given rise to social tensions we read about in newspapers every day; and present-day youth, who feel the weight of history but not necessarily its seductiveness.</p>
        <p>Behind all this is the dance itself. Except for a few suggestive movements, the actors do not dance in the play. But the dance Lata and her parents try to perform perfectly rises from the Natyasastra, an ancient book often called the fifth Veda, or last of the great religious texts. The dance's name refers to the book, and to its author, a sage called Bharata. To place a family drama in such a context is to lift it out of time into a region somewhere between myth and philosophy. That is not say you have to know the Natyasastra to get the point. (In fact, mastering this text has defeated many scholars, and some great swatches of it describing the dance are untranslatable.) Rajju Chandiramani, who designed the sound for this production, lets one hear softly in the background throughout, and more assertively in the intermission, the voices and instruments of teachers of Bharatanatyam dance, and they give a great resonance to what is spoken onstage. The ancient book says in one passage that the point is to be possessed by the divine spirit the dance calls up, and if you listen attentively here you may at least feel its touch.</p>
        <p>In a production so richly layered, the skill of the actors in moving from one role to another in the flick of an eye has to be perfect. Four cast members play seven characters from three generations. Only Lillete  Dubey, as Ratna at the end of her career, has a single role. No one is likely to forget this Ratna, a kind of Goneril with culture. But Ms. Dubey is also the director, and that is a bigger job. The play is constructed very much like a film, with time, characters, setting and the whole frame of reference changing in an instant. With each change Ms. Dubey slightly accelerates the pace so that each flashback gives added emotional punch to what follows, and the entire story moves as a single piece of narration in which past and present exist naturally together.</p>
        <p>Suchitra Pillai, an engineer by training who chose theater instead, projects an almost palpable purity of intention and singleness of purpose as Lata, the young dancer and bride. When she becomes the younger Ratna, before Lata was born, she embodies a selfish ambition for success in the dance that visibly undermines her aesthetic sensibility, leaving one pitying and fearing her at the same time. Joy Sengupta as Viswas the suitor is a fine comic innocent whose only protections are his passion and his ignorance of other people's passions. His creation of Jairaj,  Lata's father, as a young man, is so different it is almost shocking to find it in the same body. This man is intelligent, determined and angry, and Mr. Sengupta, without a word or a wink, lets you feel that his radical independence is a sure sign of instability of character.</p>
        <p>Vijay Crishna, who has played leads all over India for 30 years, may have the toughest task. As Jairaj when he is about to retire from dancing, he has masked that instability with sophisticated boredom and a teasing sense of irony. And as Jairaj's father, Amritlal, he lets you know how Jairaj got that way. If this man can be a minor force in creating a new nation, he can very well shape his own son's life, or, failing that, cripple his spirit; this father's intelligence intimidates with every word, and his personality crushes with every embrace.</p>
        <p>Experiencing acting of this quality is transforming and, no matter how disturbing the play becomes at times, joyful. The lofty aesthetic ideals expressed in the Natyasastra may be beyond human realization -- at times that seems to be the point of them -- but this production is not an insignificant tribute.</p>
        <p>DANCE LIKE A MAN</p>
        <p>By Mahesh Dattani; directed by Lillete Dubey; lighting by Lynne Fernandez; sound by Rajju Chandiramani. Part of the Festival of Indian Theater. Presented by the Indo-American Arts Council. At the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, 199 Chambers Street.</p>
        <p>WITH: Suchitra Pillai (Lata and younger Ratna), Joy Sengupta (Viswas and younger Jairaj), Vijay Crishna (Older Jairaj and Amritlal Parekh) and Lillete Dubey (Older Ratna).</p>
