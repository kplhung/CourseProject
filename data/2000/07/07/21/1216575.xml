        <p>Metropolitan DeskThe House of Representatives tonight approved measures to bar the Treasury Department from enforcing restrictions on travel to Cuba as well as on the sale of food and medicines to the island.</p>
        <p>Critics of the 38-year-old American trade embargo on Cuba hailed the votes as a major first step in the House toward clearing the way to commercial ties and even American tourism.</p>
        <p>By a vote of 232 to 186, lawmakers ordered that the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the chief bureau for enforcing sanctions against Cuba, be prohibited from spending federal funds to restrict Americans from traveling there or engaging in the sale of food and medicine.</p>
        <p>Sixty Republicans voted in favor of the amendment on travel, which was added to the bill to finance the Treasury Department and Postal Service by Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanford expressed elation at the vote, which he said was a sign that lawmakers are increasingly prepared to engage the government of Cuba, just as they have sought to end the isolation of governments such as China and Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanford said the vote would help correct ''an incredible inconsistency'' in American foreign policy, and marked a victory for Americans who claim a constitutional right to travel to nations whose governments are at odds with the United States.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Sanford said, American travel will advance the cause of democratic reforms in Cuba more surely than efforts to isolate the Cuban people.</p>
        <p>''This marks the beginning of the an end for an outdated policy toward Cuba,'' he said. ''We've tried 40 years of isolation. It has not worked. The will of the house is that we take this incremental step.''</p>
        <p>Advocates of sanctions against Cuba noted that it still remains illegal for Americans to travel there as tourists, even if the Treasury Department becomes unable to enforce the law.</p>
        <p>There is no companion measure on travel currently before the Senate, the critics noted, and the overall bill faces a presidential veto on unrelated matters.</p>
        <p>''It has little practical effect, because the law hasn't changed,'' said Representative Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who is one of three Cuban-American members of Congress. ''What you've done in this act is to create lawlessness.''</p>
        <p>Still, the vote on travel to Cuba has particular resonance. Until the 1959 triumph of the revolution, Cuba was the leading American tourism destination in the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the government of Fidel Castro has built up tourism, adding European-financed hotels in Havana and at the popular beach resort of Varadero.</p>
        <p>Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American Republican from Florida, charged that the measure would provide revenues to ''the worst violator of human rights in all of the Western Hemisphere.''</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration since last year has greatly broadened the categories of Americans allowed to travel to the island, allowing more than 200 universities to license student travelers. Such people-to-people contacts, American officials say, will enhance the prospects for a peaceful political transition to democracy.</p>
        <p>About 135,000 Americans visited Cuba last year on government-approved trips. Another 22,000 traveled illegally through third countries such as the Bahamas or Mexico, according to Treasury Department estimates.</p>
