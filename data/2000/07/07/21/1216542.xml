        <p>Carl Everett, one half of the heart of the Boston Red Sox offense, was suspended for 10 games and fined $5,000 yesterday for his encounter -- physical and verbal -- with an umpire in a game on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Everett postponed the suspension, which was to have begun yesterday, by appealing the disciplinary action by Frank Robinson, major league baseball's vice president for on-field operations. Everett then went out and hit a two-run home run in the first inning of the first game of a day-night doubleheader in Baltimore.

        <p>Carl Everett, one half of the heart of the Boston Red Sox offense, was suspended for 10 games and fined $5,000 yesterday for his encounter -- physical and verbal -- with an umpire in a game on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Everett postponed the suspension, which was to have begun yesterday, by appealing the disciplinary action by Frank Robinson, major league baseball's vice president for on-field operations. Everett then went out and hit a two-run home run in the first inning of the first game of a day-night doubleheader in Baltimore. He was 1 for 5 and struck out four times in Boston's 11-7 victory, and was 0 for 3 in the second game, a 9-4 loss.</p>
        <p>In announcing the suspension, Robinson said he acted because of the outfielder's excessive arguing, foul language and contact with Ron Kulpa, the home plate umpire, who had told Everett he was standing too close to home plate when he batted against the Mets in a 6-4 Boston triumph.</p>
        <p>Everett bumped Kulpa with his chest, then slammed his helmet to the ground and struck the umpire in the face with his face, sending Kulpa staggering backward.</p>
        <p>Red Sox personnel had difficulty controlling and calming the enraged Everett, who, when he finally reached the dugout, knocked over a water container and tossed a bat onto the field, just missing a teammate, Bret Saberhagen, in the process.</p>
        <p>With a .317 batting average and a team-leading 26 home runs and 74 runs batted in,  Everett will leave a hole in the Red Sox lineup when he serves his suspension, whether it's 10 games or a reduced number. He and Nomar Garciaparra form the nucleus of the team's offense, and the Red Sox can ill afford to lose him in their quest for a playoff spot.</p>
        <p>Some people believed Everett would be hit with a longer suspension. Robinson might have been inclined to make it longer, but he wound up somewhat in the middle of the range of previous suspensions for similar actions.</p>
        <p>At the hearing on Everett's appeal, Players Association lawyers will argue that both the length of the suspension and the fine are excessive. Management lawyers will most likely use as Exhibit A the case of Bill Madlock, who in a 1980 game shoved his glove into the face of Umpire Jerry Crawford. Madlock was fined $5,000 and suspended for 15 days. After his appeals were denied, the Pittsburgh third baseman served the suspension and missed 15 games.</p>
        <p>Vince Coleman of St. Louis, on the other hand, was fined $500 and suspended for seven games in 1990 after he cut Ed Montague's nose with the bill of his batting helmet.</p>
        <p>The longest suspension for physical contact with an umpire is believed to belong to Pete Rose, who as manager of the Cincinnati Reds in 1988 was given 30 days for pushing Dave Pallone. A. Bartlett Giamatti, then National League president, imposed the severe penalty because, he said, Rose's action incited Riverfront Stadium fans, who threw objects onto the field.</p>
        <p>Everett became incensed when Kulpa drew a line with his foot, indicating the border of the batter's box at the side near home plate. Everett stands closer to the plate than most batters, and Kulpa felt he was closer than the six inches the rules stipulate should separate the plate from the batter's box.</p>
        <p>In Baltimore yesterday, Everett said the coverage of his incident with the umpire ''tried to make me out to be a monster.''</p>
        <p>''I would say I didn't do the things people said I did,'' he added. ''I could say some things that could ruffle some feathers, but I'd rather keep that to myself until I state my case.''</p>
        <p>Everett's contact with Kulpa's head has been described by some as a headbutt, but Larry Reynolds, Everett's agent, said he looked at a tape of the confrontation frame by frame and saw no such thing.</p>
        <p>''Carl's lips and nose touched the umpire,'' Reynolds said in a telephone interview, ''but his forehead clearly never touched the forehead of the umpire. There clearly was no headbutt.''</p>
        <p>Speaking by telephone, Robinson declined to elaborate on his decision, explaining that he will have to testify at the appeal hearing before Paul Beeston, chief operating officer of Major League Baseball. No date has been set for the hearing.</p>
