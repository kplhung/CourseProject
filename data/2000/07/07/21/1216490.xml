        <p>Few economists put their faith in pipe dreams, much less the visions of politicians looking toward higher office. But Luis Ernesto Derbez -- a World Bank manager who served in Africa, Asia and Central America -- said he had let his emotions take the lead when he decided to join the improbable quest of Vicente Fox for the Mexican presidency.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Mr. Derbez was living in Washington when he received the invitation from Mr. Fox. He had met Mr. Fox, then a state governor and a prominent aspirant for his center-right party's presidential nomination, a year earlier while guest teaching at the Technological Institute of Higher Studies in Monterrey. The meeting, Mr. Derbez said, left him inspired.</p>
        <p>''The vision that Vicente Fox proposed, of what needed to be done in Mexico, of the changes that he thought needed to be carried out, was a vision that at the time sounded like a dream, but it was a great necessity for the country,'' Mr. Derbez said in an interview.</p>
        <p>''It was a decision that was part emotional and part rational,'' he said about joining the Fox campaign. ''It was professionally rational in that it meant working with someone like Vicente Fox. And emotional because he really was a person that stirred my enthusiasm.''</p>
        <p>On July 2, Mr. Fox stirred the nation when he became the first candidate in 71 years to seize the presidency from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Earlier this week, Mr. Fox announced the leaders of his transition team -- 18 men and two women responsible for seeking out the best ideas, programs and people for his administration, which will take office on Dec. 1.</p>
        <p>Mr. Derbez was named co-chairman of the economic committee with Eduardo Sojo, an economist and a former student of his. But members of the transition team say that to the president-elect, the 53-year-old Mr. Derbez ranks first among equals.</p>
        <p>During the campaign, Mr. Derbez said, he served as a kind of movie director -- working behind the scenes with a brain trust of hundreds to develop ideas for government reform and then turning them into themes for campaign speeches. Since Mr. Fox's triumph, Mr. Derbez has been more prominent in public.</p>
        <p>He has held Wall Street teleconferences and meetings with reporters as part of the president-elect's effort to signal a new openness in government. He has helped calm concerns that Mexico, as in 1994, could plunge into an election-year financial crisis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox and his advisers promise to increase annual economic growth to 7 percent midway through the six-year presidential term and to create 1.4 million jobs a year. Mr. Derbez and Mr. Sojo, who has a master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania, will work with the current administration of President Ernesto Zedillo on next year's budget with the aim of increasing spending on education and small-business loans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Derbez himself is the product of a small family business -- his parents ran a clothing factory that employed 20 workers. A husband and father of three, he earned a master's in economics at the University of Oregon and a doctorate in industrial organization at Iowa State University.</p>
        <p>Before joining the Fox campaign in 1997, he worked 14 years managing economic adjustment programs for the World Bank, served as an independent consultant to the Inter-American Development Bank and was a visiting professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Derbez said he had been looking for years for some kind of work to bring him back to Mexico, but had not been inspired or intrigued until he met Mr. Fox. Upon joining the president-elect, Mr. Derbez began seeking out the best Mexican minds, at home and abroad, for advice on how to manage the next government.</p>
        <p>This is an approach, he said, that the Fox administration hopes to incorporate into its regular activity, allowing smart and talented Mexicans living abroad to serve as advisers to government agencies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Derbez said that the creation of such advisory groups, along with giving Mexicans abroad the right to vote in elections, were some of the steps the new team hoped to take to inspire Mexican expatriates. ''There are people that send us messages, that want to participate,'' he said, ''and so the challenge right now is to gather the information and to organize some kind of programs with them.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, there are rough and politically sensitive conversations headed Mr. Derbez's way. Among some of the new government's plans are wide-ranging fiscal changes to help raise money for increased social spending in areas like education and health care. The changes would include an end of some corporate tax exemptions and the imposing of taxes on food and medicine. The Fox advisers will also explore opening the electric power and petrochemical industries to private investment.</p>
        <p>Previous privatization attempts in those industries have failed, largely because of strong union opposition to the sale of businesses related to oil. Since Mr. Fox's election, the union stance has hardened.</p>
        <p>''Whoever controls petrochemicals controls the oil,'' said Victor Garcia, a spokesman for the Mexican oil workers union. ''Whoever controls oil controls the economy. Whoever controls the economy controls politics. And whoever controls politics controls the country. That is why we will not support privatizing petrochemicals. It puts our sovereignty at risk.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Derbez has had experience in navigating politically sensitive matters. As a division chief in West Africa for the World Bank from 1992 to 1994, he supervised negotiations between France and 14 former colonies over the devaluation of their currency, the C.F.A. franc. The currency's value was cut in half overnight, causing outrage among many Africans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Derbez managed the storm, satisfying all sides, his boss at the World Bank in those years, Olivier Lafourcade, said. ''It was one of the most delicate and highly complicated issues we had ever dealt with at the bank,'' said Mr. Lafourcade, who is now director of the World Bank office in Mexico City.</p>
        <p>Asked how he plans to handle opposition to Mr. Fox's plans, Mr. Derbez invoked that same spirit. ''What cannot be done is to make abrupt decisions and impose them from above,'' he said. ''And what must be done is conversing with all the groups affected, to learn their point of view and their worries.''</p>
