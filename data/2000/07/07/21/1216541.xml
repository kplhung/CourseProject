        <p>The bases were loaded with two outs in the eighth inning, and his team was trailing by three runs. Even so, Edgardo Alfonzo knew he could not hit.</p>
        <p>When he came off the field after the bottom of the seventh, Alfonzo, the Mets' All-Star second baseman, told Manager Bobby Valentine that he could not continue. Alfonzo has been bothered all season by soreness in his right hip, and he had crossed the threshold of tolerable pain.</p>
        <p>''You know when you can play with pain, and you know when you have to shut it down because you don't feel really good,'' Alfonzo said. ''When you don't feel like you're 80 percent, it's a good thing to come out of the game and give another guy the opportunity to do the job.''</p>
        <p>In this case, the other guy was Mark Johnson, who struck out against Montreal's Dustin Hermanson, ending the inning and the Mets' best chance of the day. The Mets lost to the Expos, 4-1, and have split the eight games on this road trip heading into the opener of a three-game series in Atlanta on Friday against a Braves team that is five games ahead of them in the National League East.</p>
        <p>After playing the last five games on unforgiving artificial surfaces, Alfonzo aggravated the hip flexor on a single in the fourth inning. He will receive treatment on the hip Friday, but General Manager Steve Phillips said he did not plan for Alfonzo to visit a doctor.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo conceded that ''it's going to be a little tough'' to play against the Braves on Friday, and Valentine said the soreness would have to calm down considerably before he'd put Alfonzo in the lineup. The Mets, who are carrying 12 pitchers, will probably recall a position player on Friday.</p>
        <p>They may do something more. Phillips spent much of the game on the telephone in his Olympic Stadium box, talking with other teams about trades.</p>
        <p>The Mets may have a match with the Los Angeles Dodgers for Darren Dreifort, a starting pitcher. The Dodgers, who need a leadoff hitter and pitching prospects, like the Class AAA Norfolk outfielder Jason Tyner. Phillips is also trying to bolster the bullpen.</p>
        <p>Cincinnati Reds shortstop Barry Larkin, however, may be staying put. Jim Bowden, the Reds' general manager, flew to Houston today to meet with Larkin; Bowden had said he would do so only if he had a deal completed. After the meeting, however, Larkin seemed to indicate that he was remaining with the Reds.</p>
        <p>''If I was packing, I'd have a comment,'' he told reporters. Reds outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. has offered to defer salary to help sign Larkin, which could move along Larkin's stalled negotiations.</p>
        <p>Larkin's agent, Eric Goldschmidt, said he had received a list of teams that have contacted Bowden about Larkin, a potential free agent who must approve a trade because he has 10 years in the majors and the last five with the same club. While the Mets are on that list, Goldschmidt said he did not talk to any Mets officials today. It stands to reason that if the Reds and Mets had made a deal and Larkin had turned it down, Goldschmidt and the Mets would have spoken.</p>
        <p>Phillips could not be reached for comment tonight.</p>
        <p>For the moment, the Mets are playing their leading division rival with first baseman Todd Zeile as the only regular infielder who is not out with an injury.</p>
        <p>Shortstop Rey Ordonez is out for the season with a broken arm, and his replacement, Melvin Mora, is 3 for 26 since the All-Star Game break. Third baseman Robin Ventura, who is on the disabled list with a bruised rotator cuff, is halfway into the two-week period the Mets believe he will be sidelined. He is doing only minor exercises and has no timetable for resuming baseball activities.</p>
        <p>''You can't be sitting around waiting for a knight in shining armor in a trade to rescue your team,'' said catcher Mike Piazza. ''If we go out and get a guy that can help us out, great, but we've got to win with the core of guys that we have here now.''</p>
        <p>While the lesser-heralded Mets have contributed lately, the Mets are far less intimidating without Alfonzo and Ventura. There are fewer hitters to pitch around.</p>
        <p>''He's one of the biggest contributors to us offensively,'' starter Mike Hampton, today's losing pitcher, said of Alfonzo. ''Losing Robin is big enough, and having him out of your lineup basically kills us. Besides Todd and Mike, those are the guys that, if I was the opposing pitcher, those two guys ain't going to beat me. I'd make the other guys beat me.''</p>
        <p>With their own stars Vladimir Guerrero and Rondell White out with injuries, the Expos got a lift today from catcher Chris Widger. He homered to lead off the sixth, breaking a 1-1 tie, then stroked a two-run double off the left-field wall in the seventh. In his career, Widger is 8 for 12 off Hampton, whose record fell to 9-7.</p>
        <p>To Valentine, Hampton has not been quite as sharp since beating the Yankees on three days' rest on July 9. Hampton will get an extra day of rest because of an upcoming off day. ''That day will do him a world of good,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Hampton did not dispute that, but he dismissed the suggestion that the short rest -- or the muscle cramp in his forearm that forced him from the Yankee game -- has affected him at all.</p>
        <p>''I don't know, maybe they're searching for answers because we're losing games when I pitch,'' he said. ''I'm fine. I thought I had some of my best stuff of the year. I'm the one out there on the mound, and I don't feel like I'm different.''</p>
        <p>Hermanson, meanwhile, was masterful, allowing only seven singles and two walks over eight and two-thirds innings. Although the Mets will miss Tom Glavine and Kevin Millwood this weekend, they can expect to see more top pitching when they face Terry Mulholland, Greg Maddux and Andy Ashby at Turner Field.</p>
