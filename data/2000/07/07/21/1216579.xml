        <p>A former top aide to Gov. George E. Pataki came under vigorous cross-examination yesterday during a trial centering on charges that a Pataki fund-raiser solicited donations in exchange for political favors.</p>
        <p>The testimony by Patrick Donohue, Mr. Pataki's former campaign finance director, was the highlight of the politically charged trial, which began two weeks ago. Mr. Donohue seemed to be tripped up a handful of times as the government indicated inconsistencies in his testimony, in which he denied that he had promised to help win the parole of three violent felons whose families had contributed to Mr. Pataki's 1994 campaign for governor. Mr. Pataki has not been implicated in the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donohue said, for example, that he had no idea that one of Mr. Pataki's volunteer fund-raisers had sought donations from the three families because they were interested in getting relatives freed from prison.</p>
        <p>Moments later, however, prosecutors read the jury some of Mr. Donohue's earlier testimony, in which he admitted knowing that the fund-raiser, Yung Soo Yoo, had taken money from the families and that they wanted the Pataki administration's help in getting their sons released.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donohue was testifying at the influence-peddling trial of Mr. Yoo, a prominent New Jersey businessman who was often called upon to raise money for the Republican Party among the region's Korean-Americans. Mr. Yoo, 63, is accused of promising the three Korean families that he would use his clout within the governor's office to get their sons paroled if they donated to Mr. Pataki's campaign.</p>
        <p>The trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn stems from a two-and-a-half-year investigation into allegations that Pataki officials drummed up campaign contributions with promises of early parole. While the federal prosecutors overseeing the case have said numerous times that there is no evidence that Mr. Pataki participated in or had knowledge of the crimes charged, the case has still proved somewhat embarrassing for his administration, which has sought to eliminate parole entirely and has made it tougher for violent felons to win release.</p>
        <p>The inquiry has resulted in the perjury convictions of two state parole officials, Ronald Hotaling and Sean McSherry, and the indictment of a third, Leo S. Levy, on charges of misleading investigators in the case. It has also led to the intense scrutiny of some Pataki aides, including Mr. Donohue, who has never been charged.</p>
        <p>Michael F. McKeon, a spokesman for the governor, has said throughout the investigation that officials never engaged in wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donohue's appearance in court yesterday as a defense witness was greeted with a type of gleeful hunger by federal prosecutors, who have been investigating him since the start of the case.</p>
        <p>''You understand, Mr. Donohue, as you sit here today, that you are a target of the investigation of the United States attorney's office into federal bribery -- you understand that, right?'' a prosecutor, Margaret Giordano, asked.</p>
        <p>''Yes, ma'am,'' Mr. Donohue answered, wide-eyed but remaining calm.</p>
        <p>Over and over, Ms. Giordano tried to get Mr. Donohue to admit that he was aware that the families' contributions were taken in exchange for assistance in getting the prisoners released. But with carefully chosen words and abundant politeness, Mr. Donohue said several times that neither he nor Mr. Yoo made any specific promises to the families, who had donated more than $36,000 to Mr. Pataki's campaign.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Donohue was caught a few times saying something in open court only to have his own earlier testimony or, in two powerful instances, tape recordings, flatly contradict him.</p>
        <p>At one point, he testified that he had never sent documents in support of the release of one of the prisoners, James Jhang, to the governor's counsel's office, which often handles clemency requests. But seconds later, the prosecution played a secretly recorded tape on which Mr. Donohue was heard saying that he had, in fact, forwarded the documents to the counsel's office.</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Donohue testified that he had met Michael Jhang, the brother of James Jhang, only once. Again, the government played a tape on which Mr. Donohue was heard saying he had met Michael Jhang at least a half-dozen times.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donohue explained the first discrepancy by saying that the counsel's office was where some documents related to prisoners were typically sent, not that he had actually sent them. He explained the second by saying he was lying on the tape about having met Michael Jhang numerous times.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, Mr. Donohue's response to having his own recorded words come back to contradict him was unremarkable. He was largely emotionless.</p>
        <p>Outside the courtroom, Thomas Puccio, his lawyer, said it was ''totally improper'' for the prosecution to assail Mr. Donohue as a ''target'' in front of a jury.</p>
        <p>''This has been a witch hunt since Day 1,'' Mr. Puccio said. ''The government has been playing around with this thing for three years. My client has done nothing wrong, as I think his testimony showed.''</p>
        <p>Between the bitter barbs tossed both inside and outside court, there was a moment of levity when a juror raised her hand in the middle of Mr. Donohue's testimony to complain that she could not hear him.</p>
        <p>''When you ask people for money, you probably talk a lot louder,'' Judge Fredric Block told Mr. Donohue. ''So just pretend you're at a fund-raiser.''</p>
