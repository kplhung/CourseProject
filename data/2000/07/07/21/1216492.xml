        <p>After three seasons as Giants coach, Jim Fassel has hardly carved a public image as a swashbuckling risk-taker. Fassel may put his boat in the Hudson to cruise and relax during the off-season, but no one has ever called him a riverboat gambler.</p>
        <p>But with Giants training camp opening today, Fassel presides over a high-stakes game. Lose this season -- he may even have to win big -- and he loses his seat at the table. And he's down to his last cards.</p>
        <p>''There are certain times when you can't play the safe hand,'' Fassel said last week as he made final preparations for his team's four-week training camp, which opens on the campus of the State University at Albany. ''You've got to take calculated risks that you believe in. I've got to make moves, and put my faith in certain guys.''</p>
        <p>For guidance, Fassel can look back to his future.</p>
        <p>As a rookie coach in 1997, Fassel was nothing if not daring as he tried to shake up a staid, slumbering organization with wholesale lineup changes. In his first game, Fassel started four rookies. One of them, safety Sam Garnes, won the season-opening game with a 95-yard interception return for a touchdown. The Giants, with new blood all over the field, went on to win their division.</p>
        <p>In following seasons, it seemed as if Fassel and others in the organization spent too much time and energy trying to recapture the magic of 1997 when a fresher course may have been warranted. The lesson of 1997 was that the Giants certainly needed change. The lesson lost was that they needed to keep changing.</p>
        <p>To be sure, a lack of talent, especially on offense, inhibited the team's imagination. But too often around Giants Stadium, one heard the phrase, ''this is how we're going to have to win.''</p>
        <p>They aren't saying that around Giants Stadium any longer.</p>
        <p>The team heads to training camp trying to win in different ways with a host of new players. There could be as many as 11 new starters by the time the Giants open the regular season against the Arizona Cardinals on Sept. 3 at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>''You lose, you make changes,'' said Fassel, whose 1999 team lost its final three games for a 7-9 record.</p>
        <p>Most notably, the Giants have put a priority on speed and athleticism.</p>
        <p>Why is Shaun Williams, who has never started a National Football League game at free safety, the new starter at the position instead of last year's starter, Percy Ellsworth?</p>
        <p>Because Williams is faster, stronger and more athletically gifted. Will that make Williams the better free safety? Time will tell.</p>
        <p>It is a recurring theme. With change comes risk.</p>
        <p>Why is Mike Barrow, the Giants' principal off-season acquisition, the new middle linebacker?</p>
        <p>Because his quickness can keep him on the field for every down, making him valuable as a pass rusher or in coverage. Corey Widmer, his predecessor, was more of a traditional run-stopping linebacker who came out on passing downs. Still, Barrow was cut by the Carolina Panthers, who aren't exactly a defensive powerhouse.</p>
        <p>Why is Kerry Collins the quarterback?</p>
        <p>Because he has every physical tool one would mold into the modern quarterback. In practice, the theoretical laboratory of football, Collins's passing abilities inspire awe.</p>
        <p>When it comes to playing for keeps, there have been moments of awe and moments of awful for Collins. He put on a quarterback clinic in the 41-28 victory over the Jets last year, throwing for 341 yards. But over all, in his last 21 games, Collins has thrown 20 touchdowns and 26 interceptions.</p>
        <p>Can Fassel, long called a quarterback guru, bring out the Collins who dominates practices and eliminate the Collins who creates turnovers? It is the most pivotal question of all as the Giants begin their seventh consecutive season searching for a replacement for Phil Simms.</p>
        <p>No quarterback can play without protection, which leads to yet another prominent gamble. The offensive line will have four new starters. Gone is center Brian Williams, along with both tackles, Scott Gragg and Roman Oben. Luke Petitgout, last year's top draft pick, and the free-agent acquisition Lomas Brown are slated to be the new tackles. Glenn Parker, another veteran free-agent signee, takes over at left guard and Dusty Zeigler, a free agent from Buffalo, is the new center.</p>
        <p>This refitted crew will not only have to keep Collins upright but open holes for Ron Dayne, the Heisman Trophy winner the Giants drafted to stop the revolving-door system of running backs that eventually ruined the Giants' rushing attack.</p>
        <p>Some called the drafting of Dayne last April a gamble. How do you emphasize speed with a 258-pound running back?</p>
        <p>Ernie Accorsi, the Giants' general manager, believes Dayne's best attribute is his quickness.</p>
        <p>There are other gambles up and down the lineup. Was Joe Jurevicius worth a second-round pick two years ago? Because he, or someone, has to blossom into the much-needed third receiver? Who is going to play left cornerback now that Phillippi Sparks is gone, along with his planned replacement, Conrad Hamilton? Can the Giants finally find a way to get tight end Pete Mitchell into the mix? Can cornerback Jason Sehorn stay healthy and, moreover, can he prove he's still the Pro Bowl-caliber talent he was three years ago?</p>
        <p>There is a lot on the table for the courteous, affable Fassel, the N.F.L.'s coach of the year in 1997 who now faces an uncompromising, 16-game, win-or-else assignment. Fassel has responded by pushing all his chips to the center of the table.</p>
        <p>''There never are any safe choices in this business,'' Fassel said. ''And I don't want there to be any.''</p>
        <p>Dayne Is Close to Agreement</p>
        <p>Ron Dayne, the Giants' top draft pick, is close to agreeing on contract terms. But the Heisman Trophy-winning running back could still miss the team's first two training camp practices Saturday because the deal may not be completed by then. While a lengthy holdout isn't expected, several other unsigned National Football League rookies are watching the Dayne negotiations closely. Dayne, the 11th pick over all, has been considering a five-year contract with a signing bonus between $4 million and $5 million. Arizona's Thomas Jones, the seventh pick over all, and Jamal Lewis, who was Baltimore's fifth pick, have not signed. And they probably won't sign until they see what Dayne and his agent get from the Giants.</p>
