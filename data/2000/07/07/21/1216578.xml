        <p>A 16-year-old Norwegian who helped write a program that cracks the security scheme protecting movies stored on DVD's told a federal judge yesterday that he did it so he could use a computer running the Linux operating system to watch movies on discs he had purchased. Working with two programmers he met through the Internet, Jon Johansen said it was not difficult to break the security code. Mr. Johansen, who is currently under investigation by Norwegian authorities, was called as a defense witness in a copyright infringement case brought by eight movie studios against a magazine publisher who posted the program on his Web site.</p>
