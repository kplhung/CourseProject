        <p>Signaling that the problems of many Internet start-ups are not hurting their larger cousins, America Online yesterday reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $338 million, up 115 percent from a year earlier.</p>
        <p>America Online, the world's biggest Internet company and one of the few profitable ones, earned 13 cents a share, 2 cents more than analysts had expected. But analysts, generally conservative in their predictions, said the results were solid but contained few surprises.</p>
        <p>''They didn't come in with any fireworks here, but they met expectations,'' said Paul Noglows, an analyst with Chase H&amp;Q.</p>
        <p>For the company's fiscal year, ended June 30, it earned $1.2 billion on sales of $6.9 billion, marking the first time an Internet company has earned more than $1 billion in a year.</p>
        <p>''Only four years ago after becoming the first Internet company with $1 billion in annual revenue, we now post $1 billion in profit,'' Steve Case, the chairman, boasted on a conference call with investors yesterday.</p>
        <p>Despite the well-publicized problems of many Internet companies, most of which had been big advertisers on AOL's services, the company's advertising and electronic commerce revenue increased by 95 percent to $609 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Case played down any slowing in an interview yesterday.</p>
        <p>''The vast majority of our advertising revenue comes from companies like Coca-Cola, which have been around for a long time and will be around forever,'' he said. ''The minority comes from dot-com's, and of that, most come from well-funded companies.'' He also noted that even the most troubled start-ups might well manage to be taken over, as CDNow, an AOL client, was yesterday by Bertelsmann.</p>
        <p>''It's pretty clear that now they will be able to pay their bills,'' Mr. Case said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Case added that he expected  growth in advertising to remain steady for the rest of the year and to pick up next year when the company's acquisition of Time Warner is completed. He noted that there was  little overlap between the top advertisers at AOL and Time Warner, creating the opportunity to sell more to existing clients.</p>
        <p>Mr. Case dismissed statements by the Walt Disney Company that it would ask federal regulators to force the combined AOL and Time Warner to spin off its cable systems or otherwise make sure that its content was not given more favorable treatment on its distribution networks. He said he agreed with statements by Gerald Levin, his counterpart at Time Warner, calling Disney's move ''silly and absurd.'' And he said he did not expect any problems completing the acquisition by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Analysts agreed. ''There has long been an issue about the cable assets,'' Mr. Noglows said. ''But I don't see that as a deal breaker.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, America Online is continuing its unparalleled growth. In the most recent quarter, subscription revenue increased by 26 percent to $1.2 billion.</p>
        <p>Even though spring is historically the slowest season for new customers, the flagship service added 992,000 new subscriptions in the quarter for 23.2 million members worldwide.</p>
        <p>AOL's CompuServe 2000 service, which is offered with rebates and discounts to appeal to price-conscious customers, added 146,000 members in the quarter. After a loss of about 50,000 subscribers to the company's older and more expensive CompuServe Classic service, CompuServe's total membership worldwide membership rose to 2.8 million. Over the last year, CompuServe 2000 added 1.3 million new subscriptions, but the classic service lost 500,000 subscriptions.</p>
        <p>The international versions of the AOL and CompuServe services added a total of 200,000 subscribers in the quarter to reach 3.6 million.</p>
        <p>AOL said its expenses were up 25 percent to $1.5 billion for the quarter. But it said that it benefited from sharp drops in the cost of providing the telecommunications network, largely resulting from regulatory changes.</p>
        <p>Highlighting America Online's strong financial position, even in contrast to the other large Internet companies, its cash position increased by $1.9 billion over the last year to $3.9 billion at the end of the quarter.</p>
        <p>The company said that its backlog of commitments to advertise in the future increased by $300 million in the quarter, to $3 billion, twice the level of a year ago.</p>
