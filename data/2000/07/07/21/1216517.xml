        <p>Months after Senator John McCain adamantly closed the door to accepting his party's vice-presidential nomination, a Republican close to him said today that he would take the No. 2 spot on the ticket if Gov. George W. Bush offered it.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain's turnaround, which was described as reluctant, came as a growing number of Republicans lobbied for the Arizona senator as the best possible addition to the ticket. Some House Republicans, looking for help in holding the House majority, were circulating a petition to Mr. Bush that said he and Mr. McCain would make the best ticket.</p>
        <p>The senator signaled his willingness to be Mr. Bush's running mate this week in a telephone conversation with Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, according to the Republican official close to Mr. McCain. The official said Mr. Ridge telephoned Mr. McCain on Tuesday to say that he believed he was no longer in the running for the No. 2 slot and to urge Mr. McCain to put his name into consideration.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. McCain's apparent willingness to take the job, several advisers to Mr. Bush were skeptical that the governor would consider him.</p>
        <p>And Karen P. Hughes, the governor's spokeswoman, said simply, ''Governor Bush has said all along that he takes Senator McCain at his word that he does not wish to be considered for the vice presidency.''</p>
        <p>Tim Reeves, Governor Ridge's spokesman, would not divulge the contents of the conversation between the two men earlier this week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reeves said the discussion was ''not an unusual event -- they've known each other for 20 years.'' He described the talk as ''a private conservation between them'' that he could not discuss.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain has long been considered an unlikely choice for Mr. Bush because of the premium that the Texas governor places on loyalty and the sometimes strained relations between the two men.</p>
        <p>The attention that focused on Mr. McCain today may have been nothing more than the wishful thinking of his loyalists. It also reflected the frenzy of speculation among political insiders about whom Mr. Bush will pick.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain was among a number of politicians whose phone numbers were collected today by aides to Richard B. Cheney, the former defense secretary who is heading Mr. Bush's search team, so that the Bush campaign can let them know in the coming days of the Texas governor's decision.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain was not the only person being promoted. Bill Powers, the chairman of the New York Republican Party, announced at one point in the day that ''good sources'' had indicated to him that Gov. George E. Pataki was on the short list. Mr. Pataki's aides immediately said they did not have such information.</p>
        <p>Other possible candidates include: Mr. Ridge; Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma; Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia; Senators Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, Fred Thompson and Bill Frist, both of Tennessee; and Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio. Former Senator John Danforth of Missouri, who pulled out of the running more than a month ago, is also drawing renewed speculation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Keating said today that he had submitted information on his finances and health to Mr. Cheney several weeks ago and had not heard from him since.</p>
        <p>''That's why I'm not holding my breath,'' he said. But later, a Republican strategist close to Mr. Keating said the governor's office had also been asked to provide Mr. Cheney with weekend phone numbers.</p>
        <p>Some Republicans believe Mr. Cheney himself is a contender. Mr. Bush was asked about this several times today and did not answer.</p>
        <p>The sudden indications that Mr. McCain would agree to be vice president were part of a strange dance that has been going on for months, and even today the McCain camp was sending mixed signals. A Republican who knows Mr. McCain well insisted that the senator still hoped he was never offered the job.</p>
        <p>''It's not something he would prefer to happen,'' said a close associate.</p>
