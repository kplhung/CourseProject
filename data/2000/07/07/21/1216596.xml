        <p>The old nature-culture duality gets a diversified workout in this entertaining show. What comes through overall is a feeling not of closeness to nature but of distance, as if the 13 artists included were speculating about the rumor of some strange, little-known dimension of reality.</p>

        <p>Caren Golden  526 West 26th Street  Chelsea  Through next Friday</p>
        <p>The old nature-culture duality gets a diversified workout in this entertaining show. What comes through overall is a feeling not of closeness to nature but of distance, as if the 13 artists included were speculating about the rumor of some strange, little-known dimension of reality.</p>
        <p>In a neatly fabricated machine by John Kalymnios, illuminated photo-transparencies of rippled water slide back and forth, creating the hypnotic illusion of slow, oceanic rolling; the moving image is in turn projected by video onto an adjacent wall, creating a small blurry image that is like a fragment from a barely remembered dream.</p>
        <p>Not naturalism, indeed, but surrealism: Marguerite Kahrl's funny ''Conversation With a Luddite'' ensconces a little reproduction of the Unabomber's cabin in a papier-mache tree; from it issues the recorded discourse of someone with complicated anti-modernist theories.</p>
        <p>Roxy Paine creates magically realistic cow pies from which psychedelic mushrooms sprout.</p>
        <p>Nina Katchadorian shows photographs of mushrooms to which she has added colorful rubber patches. And Austin Thomas photographs or paints pictures of ordinary-looking stones and adds odd, typewritten diaristic stories about them.</p>
        <p>One senses some autobiographical meaning in an oblique but haunting three-part installation by Robert Beck.</p>
        <p>It includes a video of a taxidermist working on a deer hide to the sound of an Al Green song; a goofy little deer sculpture made from a toilet paper roll; and a shelf with the photograph of a grizzled farmer holding a yearbook portrait of a young man -- his son, maybe, who, one cannot help guessing, must have died in a hunting accident.</p>
