        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>B-52'S, GO GOS, PSYCHEDELIC FURS, Jones Beach, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000. Nostalgia for the 80's is in full effect on this triple bill, which could be called Monsters of New Wave. All great in their prime, all worthy of a good living now that their hairstyles and arty sensibilities aren't exactly in fashion, these bands will surely still deliver fun and many sweeping gestures in concert. The B-52's made camp postmodern, the Go Gos pioneered grrrl power, and the Psychedelic Furs did that brooding English thing better than any of their peers. (Take that, Robert Smith of the Cure!) Pull out your fuschia clothes and do the Rock Lobster. Tonight at 7 p.m.; tickets are $32 and $42 (Ann Powers).</p>

        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>B-52'S, GO GOS, PSYCHEDELIC FURS, Jones Beach, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000. Nostalgia for the 80's is in full effect on this triple bill, which could be called Monsters of New Wave.

Pull out your fuschia clothes and do the Rock Lobster. Tonight at 7 p.m.; tickets are $32 and $42 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>GARY BARTZ, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. After 30 years, the burning saxophonist still has something of an underground reputation; he is always the stealth candidate for a great night of music. It's largely because he hasn't had the wide exposure on records that he deserves, but records never tell the truth anyway. Sets through Sunday are at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., with a 1 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $20 tonight and tomorrow, $15 on Sunday, with a $10 minimum all days (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* CHOCOLATE GENIUS, BAM Cafe, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4139. Marc Anthony Thompson, a k a Chocolate Genius, writes desolate, telling, unsparing songs full of goodbyes, from doomed romances to senile parents. He has a husky voice and a band that can put a subtle jazz swing into his twilit ballads. Tonight at 9; no cover, $10 minimum (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>DEAD PREZ, ANTI-POP CONSORTIUM, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. These two crews offer a serious alternative to mainstream hip-hop's materialist fascinations. Dead Prez is a duo unafraid to be identified as revolutionary; in funky rhymes, the group pays respects to Mao Zedong and advocates health food diets. Anti-Pop Consortium is more focused on wordplay, but it still offers a purer vision of hip-hop's glories than many. Tonight at 11:30; tickets are $20 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* DIAMANDA GALAS, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8770. Hey, kids, do you think Eminem is scary? Then you don't know about Diamanda Galas, the true matriarch of popular music's sinister caverns, the woman with the bloodcurdling four-octave voice and the courage to use it to expose society's darkest secrets. In this program, Ms. Galas surveys her repertory, which means you may get to hear her amazing versions of Willie Dixon's ''Insane Asylum'' and Johnny Cash's ''25 Minutes to Go'' alongside her own stirring compositions. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; admission is $30 (Powers).</p>
        <p>DIGITAL CLUB FESTIVAL, www.digitalclubfestival.com. Stay-at-homes with fast Internet connections can log on to club shows from all over the place, at nearly any hour from today through Tuesday, as the Digital Club Network shows off the potential of live online music. Among the possibilities: Guided by Voices (a rebroadcast) today at 6 p.m.; Richard Thompson's sold-out show from Maxwell's in Hoboken, N.J., tomorrow at 7:45 p.m.; De La Soul from the 9:30 Club in Washington, tomorrow at 10 p.m.; Superchunk from Brownies, tomorrow at 11:15 p.m. and Sunday at 5:15 p.m.; Steve Earle from Lupo's in Providence, R.I., Sunday at 9:30 p.m.; Wilco at the Blue Note in Columbia, Mo., Sunday at 10:30 p.m.; X at the Casbah in San Diego, Sunday night at 2:30 a.m.; the Wu-Tang Clan at Crowbar in State College, Pa., Monday at 10 p.m.;, Juan Atkins at the Granada Theater in Lawrence, Kan., Monday at 11:30 p.m.; Aimee Mann and Michael Penn at McCabe's in Santa Monica, Calif., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.; and Patti Smith at the 40 Watt in Athens, Ga., Tuesday at 8 p.m. Cigarette smoke and spilled beer are up to the user; so is sleep (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* GRANDDADDY, HOME, BRIGHT EYES, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. This fine bill of literary experimentalists shows what pop would be like if Radiohead were as popular as Kid Rock. Strange textures serve whimsical daydreams and dark confessions in these bands, all of which take moody rock beyond its usual frames. Granddaddy is from Modesto, Calif.; Home is from Tampa, Fla.; and Bright Eyes is from Omaha. This is the sound of rock 'n' roll Americana, exploding. Tonight at 8; tickets are $10 (Powers).</p>
        <p>HELLRIDE EAST, DOUGHTY, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Hellride East is a collegiate-rock power trio with Mike Watt, the bassist from Firehose, joining two-thirds of Dinosaur Jr.: J Mascis on guitar and Murph on drums. They'll be playing the primordial hard-rock songs of the Stooges, though probably not baring their chests like Iggy. Doughty is M. Doughty, whose wisecracking neo-Beat rapped lyrics were the core of Soul Coughing, performing solo with a guitar. Tomorrow at 10 and Sunday at 9 p.m.; admission is $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>JAVON JACKSON QUARTET, Iridium, 48 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. Without staging a full-scale subversion of jazz, the tenor saxophonist Javon Jackson makes good decisions about material and instrumentation; there might be a Hammond organ on the bandstand, and you might hear music by Frank Zappa, Caetano Veloso or Carlos Santana. As a soloist, he's thoughtful in a Joe Henderson way, laid back enough to savor the horn's natural gargles. Sets are tonight through Sunday at 8:30 and 10:30; also midnight tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25 with a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>LUCY PEARL, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. When this supergroup played S.O.B.'s recently, it took one night to get all the studio tricks working onstage, but the second night was sheer adrenaline and muscle. Incorporating Ali Shaheed Muhammad's turntablism into Rafael Saadiq and Dawn Robinson's sleek and smoky rhythm-and-blues, Lucy Pearl has the hit-making potential of the bands its members left behind: Toni Toni Tone, A Tribe Called Quest and En Vogue. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $30 (Powers).</p>
        <p>KEVIN MAHOGANY, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. Mahogany, a baritone jazz singer, synthesizes about 50 years' worth of stylistic information. In one set you may get an index of tones, projections and suavities ranging from Jimmy Rushing to Joe Williams to Jon Hendricks.  Sets tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10:30, with a $25 cover and $10 minimum; Sunday sets are at 7 and 9 p.m., with a $18 cover and a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>MACHEL MONTANO AND XTATIK, SONS OF STEEL, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, (718) 855-7882, extension 45. Machel Montano leads Xtatik, a soca band for the video era. The Trinidadian grooves are bright and pushy, chanted lyrics urge everybody to dance, and smiley performers stake out formations onstage. Drupatee, a singer who brings out Trinidad's connections to India, is the band's guest; Sons of Steel, a youthful steel-drum band, opens the show. Tonight at 7:30; admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MANDRILL, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Mandrill came out of Bedford-Stuyvesant in the early 1970's, merging funk, rock and touches of jazz in grooves so efficient they sounded obvious. They weren't; two decades later, while acid-jazz groups and record-collector disc jockeys are trying to piece those grooves back together, Mandrill has reunited. Tonight at 8; tickets are $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* McCOLLOUGH'S SONS OF THUNDER, the Anchorage, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Cadman Plaza West and Front Street, Brooklyn, (212) 206-6674. McCollough's Sons of Thunder, with 15 trombones, is a gospel brass band, or ''shout band,'' that carries on a tradition established in the 1920's at the United House of Prayer Church in Virginia; the Sons of Thunder play at services at the United House of Prayer for All People in Harlem. The music, learned by ear and never written down, lets loose its praises with a swaggering backbeat. The band's director, singer and hortatory preacher, Elder Edward Babb, won a 1997 National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. The SRC All-City Gospel Chorale, directed by Sheila Revenal-Carpenter, shares the bill. Sunday at 5 p.m.; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 at the door (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MOMUS, ARTO LINDSAY-VINICIUS CANTUARIA DUO, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Momus loves the 1960's pop that hovered outside rock: lounge combos, soundtracks, bossa nova, Burt Bacharach and Martin Denny and Brian Wilson. In his songs, he's a word-loving, mildly misanthropic character who is particularly fascinated with the way lust derails reason, and he sets his proudly clever ruminations to blipping synthesizer polyphony. Vinicius Cantuaria is steeped in the bossa nova: its gently brushed guitar chords, its quietly elaborate melodies, its shades of sensuality and melancholy. He knows it well enough to stretch the form without losing its essence; so does Arto Lindsay, the noise-loving guitarist whose resume stretches from the no-wave band DNA to producing albums for Brazilian pop masters. Tonight at 8; admission is $12 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MOODY BLUES, Jones Beach, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000. Ms. Schmidt, the daring fifth-grade teacher who helped this critic learn about the subversiveness of rock 'n' roll, played ''Nights in White Satin'' to teach her students about the time-altering potential of art. She didn't last very long at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School. But this progressive-rock outfit has endured, and fans of highly orchestrated rock will turn out for their annual dose of high-minded balladry. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $15 to $45 (Powers).</p>
        <p>CHICO O'FARRILL AND HIS AFRO-CUBAN JAZZ ORCHESTRA, Flushing Town Hall, 137-35 Northern Boulevard, Flushing, Queens, (718) 463-7700. Mr. O'Farrill, author of some radical intertwinings of bebop and Cuban music in the 1940's and 50's, is the conductor; his son Arturo is the pianist and band-boss. Chico O'Farrill's book of music -- funny, sophisticated and dramatic, with touches of classical modernism -- sounds wonderful in the hands of the young musicians he assembled some years ago at the outset of his comeback. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., with a dance lesson starting at 7 p.m. Tickets are $24 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* BADEN POWELL, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. There's a whole samba band in Baden Powell's guitar solos, from brash percussion to sinuous melody. For four decades, since the birth of bossa nova, guitarists who hear this Brazilian virtuoso have either been taking notes or pretending not to show their astonishment. He is sharing the bill with the saxophonist Leo Gandelman's quartet. Sets are through Sunday at 9 and 11:30 p.m.; there is a $35 cover and $5 minimum at tables, or $20 admission at the bar (Pareles).</p>
        <p>BENNY POWELL QUINTET, Up Over Jazz Cafe, 351 Flatbush Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 398-5413. Mr. Powell, a local-favorite trombonist, worked with Lionel Hampton and Count Basie and has been associated with the pianist Randy Weston since the 1980's. An outgoing musician and (occasionally) singer, he plays tonight and tomorrow at 9, 10:30 and midnight; cover charge is $15, with a $5 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>TEEN JAM! Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 72nd Street, Central Park, (212) 360-2777. Don't look for Britney or Christina at this afternoon of bared midriffs. Also on the bill are the ever-entertaining dancers of the Rock Steady Crew and the vocal harmony group R-Angels. Tomorrow at 3 p.m.; admission is free (Powers).</p>
        <p>* REBIRTH BRASS BAND, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055, and Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 72nd Street, Central Park, (212) 360-2777. The Rebirth Brass Band from New Orleans updates the traditional strutting rhythms and continuous improvisation of New Orleans jazz with an infusion of funk. It hasn't left its roots behind; back home, it still plays funerals as well as club dates. Tonight at the Knitting Factory at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $14. On Sunday afternoon at Summerstage, in a concert geared to children, Rebirth shares a bill with a young brass band, Shorty Trombone, and other performers, including Sejong Samulnori, a Korean group playing percussion parade music; the Double Dutch Divas, doing jump-rope acrobatics; and the hip-hop duo of D.J. Jus and the rapper Lil' Nique. Sunday at 3 p.m.; admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>LEON REDBONE, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Leon Redbone operates on his own measure of time, a slow-motion zone where he plunks out droll, ragtimey, 1920's-style songs on his guitar and sings in a voice that flows like molasses. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; seats at tables are $20, standing room at the bar is $10; $10 minimum (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* LA SONORA PONCENA, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-2672. La Sonora Poncena, led by the pianist Papo Lucca, is one of Puerto Rico's salsa institutions, with an aggressive four-trumpet horn section and undercurrents of jazz. Tonight after 11, with Los Adolescentes opening; admission is $10 before 10 p.m., $20 after. Tomorrow night about 11, La Sonora Poncena shares the bill with the flutist Johnny Pacheco, from the Fania All-Stars, and his Charanga Show, which plays the courtly flute-and-violin-topped music that came out of Cuba in the 1950's. Admission is $15 before 11 p.m., $25 after (Pareles).</p>
        <p>THIRD WORLD, CARL HANCOCK RUX, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, (718) 855-7882, Extension 45. Third world occupies the pop end of the reggae spectrum, harmonizing on hits like ''Now That We've Found Love'' while promising ''Roots With Quality.'' Carl Hancock Rux is a singing poet who applies his words to funk, jazz and hip-hop, contemplating black manhood and thinking about revolution versus evolution. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.; admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>PAUL VAN DYK, Twilo, 530 West 27th Street, (212) 268-1600. The disc jockey and producer Paul van Dyk came out of East Berlin to become one of the leading figures in trance, the steady-pulsing, eternally upbeat dance music that fills club floors around the world. It doesn't sound better anywhere than through the stellar sound system at Twilo. Tonight at 1 a.m.; admission is $35 (Pareles).</p>
