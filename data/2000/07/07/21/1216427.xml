        <p>Andre Techine is the most novelistic of filmmakers, by which I don't mean that he stints on the visual aspects of his craft. On the contrary, his new film, ''Alice and Martin,'' like his masterpieces ''Ma Saison Preferee'' and the scandalously underrated ''Wild Reeds,'' is full of gorgeous photography, swift, elegant editing and meticulously composed scenes. Mr. Techine's camera captures the dazzling yellow of a meadow in southern France, the deep grays of Paris at night and the rhythms of the sea beating against russet rocks on the Spanish coast.</p>
        <p>But none of this beauty is thrown onto the screen for its own sake; it seems to occur almost as a byproduct of Mr. Techine's fanatical concentration on the fine grain of his story. Like a good novel, and like Mr. Techine's previous films, the story resists summary. While it glances at some interestingly knotty themes -- the tension between bohemian asceticism and consumer culture, the atavistic pull of family history, the self-destructive logic of true love -- ''Alice and Martin'' proceeds almost entirely without speech-making or exposition. You have to work a bit, especially at first, to figure out the relationships among the characters, to say nothing of their feelings and motives, but your attention is rewarded by a film of surprising depth and a few deep surprises.</p>

        <p>Andre Techine is the most novelistic of filmmakers, by which I don't mean that he stints on the visual aspects of his craft. On the contrary, his new film, ''Alice and Martin,'' like his masterpieces ''Ma Saison Preferee'' and the scandalously underrated ''Wild Reeds,'' is full of gorgeous photography, swift, elegant editing and meticulously composed scenes. Mr. Techine's camera captures the dazzling yellow of a meadow in southern France, the deep grays of Paris at night and the rhythms of the sea beating against russet rocks on the Spanish coast.</p>
        <p>But none of this beauty is thrown onto the screen for its own sake; it seems to occur almost as a byproduct of Mr. Techine's fanatical concentration on the fine grain of his story. Like a good novel, and like Mr. Techine's previous films, the story resists summary. While it glances at some interestingly knotty themes -- the tension between bohemian asceticism and consumer culture, the atavistic pull of family history, the self-destructive logic of true love -- ''Alice and Martin'' proceeds almost entirely without speech-making or exposition. You have to work a bit, especially at first, to figure out the relationships among the characters, to say nothing of their feelings and motives, but your attention is rewarded by a film of surprising depth and a few deep surprises.</p>
        <p>The first scenes play out almost breathlessly, as 10-year-old Martin (Jeremy Kreikenmayer), who lives happily with his mother, a hairdresser, and her boyfriend, a taxi driver, is abruptly sent to live on a gloomy estate ruled by his truculent father (Pierre Maguelon), a local industrialist. All this information is imparted almost in passing, as if any concession to the audience would break the spell of realism. In due course we learn that Martin is illegitimate and that he has three older half-brothers.</p>
        <p>Abruptly it's 10 years later, and Martin, grown into a handsome, delicate young man (Alexis Loret), bursts from his father's house to roam the countryside until he is caught stealing a farmer's eggs, after which he drifts to Paris, where he encounters his brother Benjamin's roommate, Alice (Juliette Binoche).</p>
        <p>One of this film's most ingenious and unnerving effects is the way it confounds our sense of time: both chronology and duration. Just when you think you've mastered the relationships among the characters and begun to infer where the story is going, the narrative swerves back into the past with whiplash-inducing suddenness. Similarly, and even more unnervingly, it's often impossible to tell whether a sequence of scenes unfolds over days, weeks or months. The ripening of Alice and Martin's relationship and its eventual crisis unfold in roughly equal screen time, with equal intensity and speed, even though their courtship lasts through several phases of Parisian weather, and their breaking point is reached during a brief retreat to an isolated Spanish fishing village.</p>
        <p>This dislocation is quite deliberate, and it effectively communicates the emotional rhythms of the characters' lives. One of Mr. Techine's skills is his ability to sustain a sense of unpredictability without sacrificing coherence. But although ''Alice and Martin'' is always engrossing, it moves at once too quickly and too slowly. During the film's last section, which follows Alice's solitary journey to Martin's hometown in search of his family secrets, much of the earlier intensity dissipates. At this point the film feels emotionally complete -- the two main characters have arrived at some understanding of each other and of themselves -- and its long denouement seems both superfluous and underdeveloped. It is suggested, but only suggested, that Martin's native territory, the Cahors region of southern France, is defined, like the American literary South, by intricate social hierarchy and gothic domestic relations. In the end, Martin's family members take over the film, and though their presence is meant to explain his despair, they end up obscuring him.</p>
        <p>But too much complication is, in this case, too much of a good thing, and the proliferation of characters allows us to see performances we might otherwise have missed, notably Carmen Maura as Martin's stepmother, and Mathieu Amalric as Benjamin. ''Alice and Martin'' is a richly populated, observant film that suffers, forgivably, from an excess of curiosity about the world it depicts -- a surfeit of generosity, intelligence and art.</p>
        <p>''Alice and Martin'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexually suggestive and obliquely violent scenes.</p>
