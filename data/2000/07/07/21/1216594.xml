        <p>Cheim &amp; Read  521 West 23rd Street  Chelsea  Through Sept. 1</p>
        <p>''Opulent'' makes a good case for the visual pleasure principal. It was conceived, a gallery news release says, as an alternative to ''media-based social realism, irony and illustration.''</p>
        <p>The six painters and two sculptors included all concentrate on the manual enrichment of surfaces through pattern, color and texture to sensually gratifying and more or less exotic effect.</p>
        <p>The show's most unabashedly opulent piece is a wall-hung sculpture by Lynda Benglis, a two-foot hemisphere resembling brains, intestines or piled rope. Cast in bronze and covered in lustrous gold leaf, it is like a treasure recovered from some ancient civilization. The other sculpture, a cast-bronze, bell-shaped object by St. Clair Cemin, also looks as if it came from another world -- possibly Islamic -- with its intricately patterned and perforated surface, but its dark patina gives it a more sober aspect.</p>
        <p>Among painters, Chris Ofili's layerings of dot fields and poured glazes punctuated by balls of elephant dung, Beatriz Milhazes's radiating blossoms, vines and silver or gold discs, and Richmond Burton's shimmering, all-over, 7-by-12-foot pointillist field all tend toward a lush, expansive flux.</p>
        <p>On the other hand orderly containment prevails in Juan Usle's subtly inflected stripe painting and in Philip Taaffe's grid of crisp black and white emblematic forms on a blurrily stained field.</p>
        <p>And the prize for the most interesting play with materials goes to Jeff Perrone, whose funky stripe paintings are made of richly colored sand, buttons and something called ''mud cloth.''</p>
