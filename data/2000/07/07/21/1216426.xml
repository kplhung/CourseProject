        <p>Teenage romantic comedies, a staple of every movie season, are often treated with contempt and condescension, not least by the people who make them, who seem to believe that young audiences will swallow a hackneyed, slapdash piece of work as long as there are cute actors and a good soundtrack. Forgettable, virtually interchangeable movies like ''She's All That,'' ''Whatever It Takes'' and the nondance parts of ''Center Stage'' operate on the disastrous assumption that since young love is trivial, stories about it can be flimsy and secondhand. But movies about adolescent longing (as distinct, for the sake of argument, from adolescent lust) are the culture's last vital link to the great studio comedies of the 1930's. If this proposition seems laughable, that's because, owing to the cynicism and laziness of filmmakers and production executives, the genre has been bled dry of its innocence, its charm and its essential seriousness.</p>
        <p>Amy Heckerling has been among the few exceptions to this sorry rule. She is responsible not only for ''Clueless'' (1996), a Jane Austen adaptation superior in wit and insight to anything the Merchant-Ivory gang could ever hope to perpetrate, but also, along with Cameron Crowe, for ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' one of the touchstones of modern youth culture, still notable for its intelligence and realism. If Ms. Heckerling's new movie, ''Loser,'' which she wrote and directed, falls short of the high standards set by her earlier work, it is at least smarter and more probing than, say, ''Boys and Girls,'' the summer's other college love story.</p>

        <p>Teenage romantic comedies, a staple of every movie season, are often treated with contempt and condescension, not least by the people who make them, who seem to believe that young audiences will swallow a hackneyed, slapdash piece of work as long as there are cute actors and a good soundtrack. Forgettable, virtually interchangeable movies like ''She's All That,'' ''Whatever It Takes'' and the nondance parts of ''Center Stage'' operate on the disastrous assumption that since young love is trivial, stories about it can be flimsy and secondhand. But movies about adolescent longing (as distinct, for the sake of argument, from adolescent lust) are the culture's last vital link to the great studio comedies of the 1930's. If this proposition seems laughable, that's because, owing to the cynicism and laziness of filmmakers and production executives, the genre has been bled dry of its innocence, its charm and its essential seriousness.</p>
        <p>Amy Heckerling has been among the few exceptions to this sorry rule. She is responsible not only for ''Clueless'' (1996), a Jane Austen adaptation superior in wit and insight to anything the Merchant-Ivory gang could ever hope to perpetrate, but also, along with Cameron Crowe, for ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' one of the touchstones of modern youth culture, still notable for its intelligence and realism. If Ms. Heckerling's new movie, ''Loser,'' which she wrote and directed, falls short of the high standards set by her earlier work, it is at least smarter and more probing than, say, ''Boys and Girls,'' the summer's other college love story.</p>
        <p>Jason Biggs, who plays Freddie Prinze Jr.'s comic sidekick in ''Boys and Girls,'' shows up here as the title character, an earnest young man named Paul from upstate New York who goes to the big city as a scholarship student at an unnamed university. (It looks a lot like New York University.) The first in his family to go to college, Paul worries to his father (Dan Aykroyd) that he won't fit in with the sarcastic sophisticates of the big city. ''You've seen that Seinfeld show,'' he explains. ''It's like that.''</p>
        <p>In fact it's a good deal worse. Paul's diffidence and decency make him an immediate target for the cruelty of his roommates, three spoiled, foppish rich boys played, with verve, conviction and the most garish wardrobe ever assembled in the service of heterosexual villainy, by Thomas Sadoski, Zak Orth and Jimmi Simpson. Their blithe sadism, which the academic system colludes with, connects ''Loser'' to the great John Hughes comedies of the mid-1980's, which concealed live wires of class antagonism within the insulating fluff of senior-prom anxiety.</p>
        <p>Soon, Paul, expelled from the dorm, is living in an animal shelter with caged cats and dogs who seem better cared for than he is. His companion in misery, the unwitting soul mate without which no romantic plot can flourish, is Dora Diamond, played by Mena Suvari, who set middle America's middle-aged male hearts aflutter in ''American Beauty.'' Ms. Suvari, no longer iconically blond and now permitted room to exercise her own warm comic talents, is well matched with the handsome, unassuming Mr. Biggs. They're attractive without being offensively cute, and their characters manage to be genuinely nice without seeming bland or phony.</p>
        <p>Speaking of phony, Dora is mixed up with a smug, predatory literature professor (Greg Kinnear) who holds her in his sway like, as Elaine once said on ''Seinfeld,'' some kind of Svenjolly. Mr. Kinnear's role smacks of anti-intellectualism, but his supercilious portrayal of wasted intelligence and gilded self-satisfaction hits its mark pretty well; the Modern Language Association might consider organizing a protest. The professor treats Dora like a plaything, but both Mr. Kinnear and Ms. Suvari are subtle enough actors so that the relationship is appallingly believable.</p>
        <p>As Paul and Dora endure cruelty and humiliation at the hands of people who hurt them for no other reason than that they have the power, ''Loser'' pushes its honesty almost to the point of grimness. Just as ''Fast Times'' stared unflinchingly at the underside of sexual awakening (in ways that no movie today would dare), so ''Loser'' glimpses a dark world of date-rape, drugs, binge drinking and general dishonesty behind the bright facade of college life.</p>
        <p>Ms. Heckerling manages to balance this dark satirical tone with a lively lightheartedness. Funny cameos from David Spade and Andy Dick (who is making a specialty of weirdo-behind-a-desk roles) help, as does the film's buoyant affection for clothes, music and its Manhattan locations.</p>
        <p>But in the end, ''Loser'' disappoints. Too many narrative possibilities are thrown away, so it never reaches the critical mass of desperate complication that would ensure a satisfying comic pay-off at the end. Paul is a little too unambiguously good, and the reward for his goodness seems to come too quickly. The last half-hour feels forced and thrown together, as if a first-rate comedy full of incident, intelligence and surprise had been nipped in the bud, or edited away. But if ''Loser'' fails to revive the fortunes of the teen romance, it at least makes a brave and sincere effort.</p>
        <p>''Loser'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Its sexual references are fairly discreet, and its strong language is carefully rationed.</p>
        <p>LOSER</p>
        <p>Written and directed by Amy Heckerling; director of photography, Rob Hahn; edited by Debra Chiate; music by David Kitay; production designer, Steven Jordan; produced by Ms. Heckerling and Twink Caplan; released by Columbia Pictures. Running time: 93 minutes. This film is rated PG-13.</p>
        <p>WITH: Jason Biggs (Paul Tannek), Mena Suvari (Dora Diamond), Greg Kinnear (Prof. Edward Alcott), Dan Aykroyd (Mr. Tannek), Thomas Sadoski (Chris), Zak Orth (Adam) and Jimmi Simpson (Noah).</p>
