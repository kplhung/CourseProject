        <p>Unlike Paris, where dogs have always been allowed in restaurants, New York makes dining out with your best friend a challenge because of the city's health code. Dogs are allowed in outdoor cafes, however, and many such spots cater to canine needs, gaining some very loyal customers. Here are 12 popular sites in Manhattan.

        <p>Unlike Paris, where dogs have always been allowed in restaurants, New York makes dining out with your best friend a challenge because of the city's health code. Dogs are allowed in outdoor cafes, however, and many such spots cater to canine needs, gaining some very loyal customers. Here are 12 popular sites in Manhattan.

        <p>1. Artie's New York Delicatessen</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 579-5959</p>
        <p>2290 Broadway,</p>
        <p>near 82nd Street</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Artie's recently added a 60-seat outdoor cafe that is popular with the doggie crowd. Water bowls and deli scraps are free. Unlike the Carnegie Deli or Katz's, Artie's does not yet have the rich aroma of a longtime deli; it's more like a young wine that gives hints of its potential. Pastrami is good but not great; same with chicken soup. The franks are excellent, slender, garlicky and crisp around the edges, arriving already spread with mustard and sauerkraut. Artie's clearly fills a need: it's often packed.</p>
        <p>2. Avenue</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 579-3194</p>
        <p>520 Columbus Avenue,</p>
        <p>at 85th Street</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>With light breakfasts and lunches and a more substantial full-service French-American menu at dinner, Avenue is trying to satisfy all sorts of appetites and is succeeding admirably. The chef, Scott Campbell, stays with familiar flavors but dresses them up stylishly. His meat dishes are especially good, like an astounding smoked prime rib of pork, a portion the size of half a football, which has absorbed the enticing aroma of hickory but remains tender and excellent, served with sausage on a bed of red cabbage and spiced apple. Another main course, slices of tender lamb crusted with rosemary, is almost its equal. The lamb is served with potatoes Louis, a rich and delicious potato cake cooked in duck fat, a homage to the famous potato dish served at L'Ami Louis in Paris. Avenue has 30 outdoor tables, each equipped with its own stainless steel water dish. Owners can order dog-appropriate dishes from the restaurant's menu.</p>
        <p>3. Bella Luna</p>
        <p>++</p>
        <p>(212) 877-2267</p>
        <p>584 Columbus Avenue, at 89th Street</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>White walls, colorful artworks and waiters in black pants and T-shirts are the sights at this casual trattoria. Although the food can be uneven, good fare can be found. Among the antipasti are grilled portobello mushrooms, polenta with wild mushroom sauce, beef carpaccio and a soup of the day. The menu has 6 salads, including one of warm chicken, and 14 pasta dishes, including penne, fettuccine, tagliatelle, rigatoni, ravioli and capellini with various embellishments. Sauteed or grilled chicken breast, grilled veal chop, sirloin steak and a fish of the day are the other entrees. Desserts include the ever-present tiramisu, tartuffo, ricotta cheesecake and wild berry tart. At 10 outdoor tables dogs are automatically served water and sometimes share dishes with their owners.</p>
        <p>4. Cafe Giardinetto</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 599-2992</p>
        <p>250 East 40th Street</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This Italian-style carryout food store has six tables outdoors and four indoors. (Small dogs are allowed inside.) The menu consists of soups, salads, several pasta dishes and sandwiches like apple-smoked turkey breast served on a Tuscan roll with wild mushrooms, house-dried tomatoes, arugula and roasted garlic aioli; and thyme-infused roasted vegetables served on a baguette with goat cheese and roasted pepper aioli. The chef has created several dishes for dogs, including minced turkey breast, chopped beef, an antipasto platter and dog biscuits. Water is automatically served.</p>
        <p>5. Cafe St. Bart's</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>212-888-2664</p>
        <p>109 East 50th Street</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The cafe on the terrace of St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue and 50th Street, has a new operator, Leslie Nilsson, who owns Sage American Kitchen in Long Island City, Queens. The chef, Donna Hall, chose a menu for this summer spot that reflects her years on Nantucket, with dishes like lobster salad and fried clams. The menu also includes chicken, lamb and striped bass cooked on an outdoor wood-burning grill, and pizza baked in an outdoor stone oven. Small dogs are welcome at all tables; water is provided upon request; and homemade dog biscuits are free.</p>
        <p>6. Chelsea Lobster Company</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 243-5732</p>
        <p>156 Seventh Avenue, at 19th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This Maine-style seafood house features steamed, broiled and baked lobster, lobster rolls and Key lime pie. When the garage-style front doors are open, the seven front tables are reserved for dogs and owners. Regulars are greeted by name, and water is served automatically in vintage dog bowls from the Fishs Eddy nearby.</p>
        <p>7. Christina's</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 889-5169</p>
        <p>606 Second Avenue, near 34th Street</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>A cheerful Italian restaurant with a sprawling outdoor section that is a home away from home for neighborhood pet owners. Pans of ice water are regularly placed on the perimeter of the cafe. There is no special menu for dogs, but dishes can be ordered off the regular menu. The menu features standard Italian fare like cheese ravioli, penne alla vodka and capellini primavera, and a variety of heroes like meatball and sausage and peppers.</p>
        <p>8. Pastis  *  [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 929-4844</p>
        <p>9 Ninth Avenue, at Little West 12th Street</p>
        <p>West Village</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Keith McNally, the owner, has divided New York into two classes: those who can get a table at Balthazar, his SoHo brasserie, and those who can't. Those who can't now crowd into his Pastis. Visually, it is perfect, and the menu is an invitation to simple pleasures. Starters include mixed green salad with goat cheese, and a salad of beets, endive, Roquefort and walnuts. Main course salads include grilled chicken paillard, salade nicoise and grilled vegetable. Entrees include steak frites; braised beef with glazed carrots; trout amandine; and pasta dishes like penne puttanesca, bucatini bolognese and mushroom ravioli with sage and butter. Dogs are allowed to sit with their owners at 11 outdoor tables. Pastis stocks dog dishes in six sizes. Each dog is automatically served water in a bowl appropriate to its size.</p>
        <p>9. Pisces</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 260-6660</p>
        <p>95 Avenue A, at Sixth Street East Village</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>An upscale European-style cafe with a small outdoor area where dogs tend to the small, lap-sitting variety. Water is provided in plastic cups when requested. The menu features dishes with Asian accents like sesame seared sashimi-grade tuna with wasabi vinaigrette; shrimp dumpling served with an Asian dipping sauce; and baked bass with Asian vegetables.</p>
        <p>10. Verbena  **  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 260-5454</p>
        <p>54 Irving Place, at 17th Street</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Diane Forley, the chef and owner of this boutique restaurant, welcomes dogs at the three cafe tables in front. Water is automatically served, and the staff is encouraged to be as hospitable to pets as to owners. Ms. Forley favors exotic combinations like duck ravioli with mushrooms in mushroom broth. The menu includes wild striped bass in cilantro-avocado cream sauce with current tomatoes, and roast chicken with quinoa pilaf with red lentils and zaatar broth. It would be a shame to miss desserts like a rum-soaked savarin, a huge yeasty doughnut filled with chocolate souffle, or the creme brulee, infused with verbena, of course.</p>
        <p>11. Vespa Cibobuono</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 472-2050</p>
        <p>1625 Second Avenue, near 84th Street</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Simple pastas served in a pleasant nook of a dining room make Vespa a good choice for a decent meal if you're in the neighborhood, especially in warm weather, when you can enjoy the garden. Dogs are welcomed with water in aluminum pans at seven outdoor tables in front. Regulars often receive scraps from the kitchen.</p>
        <p>12. Zocalo</p>
        <p>++</p>
        <p>(212) 717-7772</p>
        <p>174 East 82nd Street</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Colorful Zocalo takes an upscale approach to Mexican cuisine, with fare like grilled tuna fillet with a basil-tomatillo sauce; sauteed shrimp with white wine-garlic sauce; and shrimp and chicken enchiladas. The bar offers a wide variety of frozen, fruity margaritas and more than 50 premium tequilas. There's a doggie station by the entrance with a water bowl and biscuits. Owners can sit with their dogs at the two tables in front of the restaurant, where a framed photo of the dog of the month hangs in the window.</p>
