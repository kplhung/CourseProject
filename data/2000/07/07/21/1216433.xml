        <p>The Beach</p>
        <p>An American tourist named Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio, left) alights in Thailand, where he knocks down jiggers of snake blood and persuades two French contemporaries (Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet) to help him find the perfect beach. On the way they narrowly escape being machine-gunned by marijuana farmers before encountering a pod of like-minded Western hedonists living communally in ''paradise.'' But while Danny Boyle's film has surface tension, Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times, ''all of Mr. DiCaprio's charisma and the director's savvy are used to divert us from the fact that there's not much going on.''</p>
        <p>2000. Fox. $107.37; DVD, $34.98. 120 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: July 25.</p>

        <p>The Beach</p>
        <p>An American tourist named Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio, left) alights in Thailand, where he knocks down jiggers of snake blood and persuades two French contemporaries (Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet) to help him find the perfect beach. On the way they narrowly escape being machine-gunned by marijuana farmers before encountering a pod of like-minded Western hedonists living communally in ''paradise.'' But while Danny Boyle's film has surface tension, Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times, ''all of Mr. DiCaprio's charisma and the director's savvy are used to divert us from the fact that there's not much going on.''</p>
        <p>2000. Fox. $107.37; DVD, $34.98. 120 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: July 25.</p>
        <p>Drowning Mona</p>
        <p>No one in the tiny upstate New York town of Verplanck is overly upset when Mona Dearly (Bette Midler) is sent to her demise in a brakeless Yugo. As nasty as her name is ridiculous, Mona drew blood every time she opened her mouth, so the real mystery around her death is why anybody cares enough to find out who killed her. That assignment falls to Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito), seemingly the only reasonable person around. ''The real victims here are the characters, who've been impaled on their own Herculean pursuit of bad taste'' (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37; DVD, $24.95. 95 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: July 15.</p>
        <p>What Planet Are You From?</p>
        <p>In contrast to the paranoid creeps he has played on television and as a stand-up comic, Gary Shandling plays a man who would simply like to impregnate a woman so he can take the child back to his home planet. At a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, he comes across Susan (Annette Bening), a freaked-out real estate agent who becomes the emotional center of the film.</p>
        <p>As one of the writers of Mike Nichols's film, Mr. Shandling gives himself plenty of space to work the room, which leads to riffs about aliens, spirituality and other topics. He may have become a fine actor over the years, ''but he's finnicky and brittle here'' (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37; DVD, $24.95. 104 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>Ride With the Devil</p>
        <p>The Civil War era has never looked quite the way it does in Ang Lee's chilly, dramatically skimpy epic about a group of pro-Southern bushwhackers waging war along the Kansas-Missouri border. Far from ''Gone With the Wind,'' austere farmhouses and primitive frontier towns are better suited to an anthropological study. The story focuses on two of the bushwhackers (Tobey Maguire and Skeet Ulrich) and leads to a stunning re-creation of the guerrilla raid on Lawrence, Kan., led by William Clarke Quantrill, but the meditative quality and attention to detail ''keep the story at a distance'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>2000. Universal. $99.36: DVD, $24.98. 138 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>Straight to Vidoe</p>
        <p>Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.</p>
        <p>THE INDIAN TOMB. Fritz Lang didn't get around to directing a film of the same title until 1959. Almost 40 years earlier, he co-wrote Joe May's silent epic about the Maharajah of Eschnapur, who loses his wife to a dashing British officer and determines to destroy him and imprison her forever in a magnificent tomb he will have built expressly for the purpose. Bring on the tigers, cobras, 3,000 extras (all filmed on May's 50-acre movie lot in Germany) and Conrad Veidt as the vengeful, sadistic potentate. 1921. $79.95. Information: (800) 551-8304.</p>
        <p>IDENTIFICATION OF A WOMAN. It may not be one of Michelangelo Antonioni's best, but Antonioni is Antonioni and the movie is available for the first time on video. Tomas Milian stars as an actor caught between two women (Daniela Silverio and Christine Boisson). The actors aren't bad, but ''there are still a number of red herrings drying in the sun when the film ends,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. 1982. $79.95. 131 minutes. Italian with English subtitles.</p>
        <p>QUIET DAYS IN HOLLYWOOD. Here's an early look at Hilary Swank before all the ruckus over ''Boys Don't Cry,'' for which she won the Oscar as best actress. Josef Rusnak's film presents seven unconnected vignettes about a tawdry Hollywood world of gangsters, teenage runaways and assorted would-be's and hangers-on. 1995.  $89.95. 95 minutes. R.</p>
