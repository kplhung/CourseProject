      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Now it can be told: Hugh Jackman used to walk around the house with steel blades protruding from his knuckles.</p>
        <p>''Every day in my living room, I'd just walk around with those claws, to get used to them,'' Mr. Jackman said. ''I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned.''</p>
        <p>The process by which one of the thousands of aspiring young actors from all over the world first breaks out of the Hollywood pack and then  somehow rises to stardom is difficult to handicap. Every year a dozen or so fresh names are offered up as the next hot things and given the big push by the major studios and the top publicity firms, and 9 times out of 10,  they fall short of the golden ring. But every now and then, something clicks, and at the moment something seems to be clicking for Hugh Jackman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackman, 32, is an affable and accomplished Australian actor with a background in musical theater. His performance as Wolverine, the central character in ''X-Men,'' has transformed him from another face in the ensemble to a name above the title.</p>
        <p>''The first thing I thought when I read the script was, 'Get me to a gym,' '' Mr. Jackman said. ''It's pretty physical. We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine.''</p>
        <p>For those who are not ''X-Men''-literate, the story is set in the near future, when the next stage in human evolution has begun. Every now and then, mutants are born with weird, often uncontrollable powers. Non-mutants hate and fear them and want to destroy them or, worse, regulate them.</p>
        <p>Wolverine has the ability to heal himself almost instantly. In addition, sometime in his past (he can't remember) someone operated on him and implanted a steel skeleton that causes razor-sharp blades to protrude from his hands whenever someone ticks him off.</p>
        <p>So he's a little tense. Tread carefully.</p>
        <p>At the moment, Mr. Jackman is in New York, beginning work on a new film, ''Animal Husbandry,'' opposite Ashley Judd, another recent example of a young star bursting through the ranks. It's a romantic comedy. ''No hair, no claws,'' Mr. Jackman said.</p>
        <p>He thought he would take a little time this week, though, to go to one of the theaters in Manhattan showing ''X-Men'' and watch it with a paying audience. ''I want to hear them cheering,'' he said.</p>
        <p>An Evolving Career</p>
        <p>Ivan Reitman has become almost the grand old man of comedy in Hollywood. It seems as if it was only a couple of weeks ago that he was hanging out with the Ghostbusters. And now, after a three-year hiatus from directing, during which he got his new production company, Montecito Films, off the ground, Mr. Reitman is going back behind the camera.</p>
        <p>''Evolution'' will be a grand-scale, special-effects comedy -- his old ''Ghostbusters'' stomping ground -- with a story that contains echoes of ''X-Men,'' about a fresh burst in evolution that leads to the sudden appearance of strange creatures. But no one is watching Mike Tyson fights to prepare for it.</p>
        <p>''Basically, we want to design new creatures that make sense and aren't just silly, like a head with a hand sticking out of it, but something that makes some cognitive sense,'' Mr. Reitman said.</p>
        <p>He's just about to send the script to actors. ''We're not looking for any major movie stars or comedy stars, just really funny people who will make the story work,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And with luck, ''Evolution'' will be in theaters by mid- or late 2001.</p>
        <p>''I think people sometimes get carried away with special effects,'' Mr. Reitman said. ''The key to this movie will be that, in the end, it's a comedy.''</p>
        <p>Normal in Hollywood</p>
        <p>Vanessa Paradis set a bottle of water to one side and leaned forward, her hands clasped between her thighs, as if she were chilly. ''It's great to be here in Los Angeles because I can just be normal here,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Normal is an interesting concept for the serious and earnest Ms. Paradis, a model turned pop singer turned actress who stars in Patrice Leconte's ''Girl on the Bridge.'' Ms. Paradis, 28, was a teenager when a chance encounter at a recording studio in France resulted in her first record, ''Joe le Taxi,'' which became a huge bubble-gum hit all over Europe in the late 1980's. In 1989, she won a Cesar, the French equivalent of the Oscar, for her supporting role in ''White Wedding,'' playing a troubled teenager who seduces and destroys the teacher who tried to help her. And she has been a regular face in television and magazine advertisements. Together, they have brought a celebrity that does not always make her comfortable.</p>
        <p>''In France, I don't know, it's the look on people's faces,'' she said. ''Being looked at, being pointed at, being talked about when you are only an inch away. Here I can feel like a human being.''</p>
        <p>The reason Ms. Paradis can do that here, in the United States, is that until now her celebrity has not crossed the Atlantic, at least with anything like the intensity it enjoys in Europe. That's fine with her, she said. She needs a place to be normal.</p>
        <p>She was sitting at a chipped, weathered dining table in a side room at the Chateau Marmont Hotel on the Sunset Strip. She was in town to conclude some mixing work on her latest album, to be released in Europe later this year, to promote ''Girl on the Bridge,'' which has a limited United States premiere in New York and a few other cities next Friday, and just to hang around.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles is one of the three cities where Ms. Paradis and her husband, the actor Johnny Depp, maintain residences. (Paris and New York are the others.) They have a 14-month-old daughter, Lily-Rose Melody, and Ms. Paradis said they were expecting another baby in the fall.</p>
        <p>In the film Ms. Paradis plays Adele, another young and troubled woman. This one is stopped from hurling herself off a bridge by a circus knife-thrower who recruits his assistants from the ranks of the suicidal.</p>
        <p>''I am not as pure and smart as Adele is,'' Ms. Paradis said. ''When I read the part, there was not one word that I wanted to change.''</p>
        <p>What did stop her, at least for a moment, was that the film opens with Adele delivering an eight-page monologue directly into the camera. But in the end, she took a deep breath, focused and, with the help of Mr. Leconte, with whom she also worked on the 1998 ''Half a Chance,'' she nailed it.</p>
        <p>''But I must be honest,'' Ms. Paradis said. ''I was so afraid.''</p>
