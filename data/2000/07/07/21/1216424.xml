        <p>One way to create a musical with a great book is to base it on, well, great books. That's just what Theaterworks/USA has done with ''Reading Rainbow,'' its free summer production for children.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the PBS television series of the same title, ''Reading Rainbow'' is a lively adaptation of eight stories. Although they range from a Mexican folk tale (''Borreguita and the Coyote'') to a parable about transcending sexual and racial stereotypes (''Amazing Grace''), they have elements in common: humor, spunk irreverence and a belief in magic, even if it is sometimes accomplished with powers that are merely human.</p>

        <p>One way to create a musical with a great book is to base it on, well, great books. That's just what Theaterworks/USA has done with ''Reading Rainbow,'' its free summer production for children.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the PBS television series of the same title, ''Reading Rainbow'' is a lively adaptation of eight stories. Although they range from a Mexican folk tale (''Borreguita and the Coyote'') to a parable about transcending sexual and racial stereotypes (''Amazing Grace''), they have elements in common: humor, spunk irreverence and a belief in magic, even if it is sometimes accomplished with powers that are merely human.</p>
        <p>One of the best adaptations is ''Imogene's Antlers,'' based on the book by David Small in which the title character has a Gregor Samsa-like experience. Except that young Imogene (Hazel Anne Raymundo) doesn't mind her own metamorphosis, finding her horns a useful clothes rack, bird feeder, etc. And although Imogene's adventure is intended for theatergoers ages 5 to 9, they are not the ones laughing at her retort to her horrified parents: ''I'm here. I'm a deer. Get used to it.'' Like all clever children's entertainment, this one keeps the adults amused, too.</p>
        <p>Another treasure is ''Martha Speaks,'' Susan Meddaugh's tale about a dog who eats alphabet soup, with surprising results. ''Ooh, what fun!/ 9-1-1,'' Martha (Nancy Kathryn Anderson) trills as she foils an astonished burglar. (Part of the fun is watching grown-ups, who often talk down to children, get their comeuppance for talking down to dogs.)</p>
        <p>The music in the revue covers every style from mariachi to gospel, and the direction, by David Armstrong, does it justice. You would swear, for instance, that Gladys Knight and the Pips had day jobs as Imogene's school principal (Aurelia Williams) and her office staff .</p>
        <p>The rest of the cast -- Kevin Del Aguila, Jamie LaVerdiere and Carla Woods -- are equally delightful, whether playing lambs, coyotes or that truly peculiar species, parents.</p>
        <p>''Reading Rainbow,'' through July 29 at the Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues. Shows: Daily at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. except July 29, at 11 a.m. only. Free tickets available, first come first serve, starting at 10 a.m. on the day of performance. Information: (212) 642-6754.</p>
        <p>A Russian Invasion</p>
        <p>You might say that the Russians have gone from cold war enemies to cold-water friends. They will indeed gather on New York's shores this weekend, but the purpose will be a cordial conquest of hearts and minds, all in the name of saving creatures that live in Russia's chilly seas.</p>
        <p>''From Russia With Love,'' tomorrow and Sunday at the New York Aquarium in Brooklyn, will highlight beluga whales and sturgeon, two species that are struggling to survive. The aquarium will also salute Russian culture. LuAnn Adams, a storyteller, will offer Russian folk tales, using aquatic animals as characters.</p>
        <p>''Biological diversity is the key to survival of wildlife,'' said Angie Pelekidis, the aquarium's manager of public affairs. New York has so many ethnic groups, she added, that it seemed fitting to show how cultural diversity contributes to a city.</p>
        <p>Brighton Beach's own Russian immigrant community will star in the festivities, with music and folk dancing by the Brighton Ballet Theater. Children will receive a Millennium Marine activity book and create fish prints, buttons and some tangible Russian culture: handmade versions of the classic nesting eggs.</p>
        <p>''From Russia With Love,'' tomorrow and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the New York Aquarium, Surf Avenue and West Eighth Street, Coney Island, Brooklyn, (718) 265-3474. Free with admission: $9.75; the elderly and ages 2 to 12, $6.</p>
        <p>Another Odd Couple</p>
        <p>Just think of them as the Oscar and Felix of the amphibian world. Or, in Adrianne Lobel's view, the Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.</p>
        <p>They are Frog and Toad, the heroes of the children's storybooks written and illustrated by Arnold Lobel, Ms. Lobel's father. Ms. Lobel, a set designer, has long wanted to bring these characters to the stage, and she will have her wish this weekend: Vassar College and New York Stage and Film are to present ''A Year With Frog and Toad: The New Musical,'' a workshop production at the Powerhouse Theater on the Vassar campus in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''I think of them as Edwardian gentlemen; they wear straw hats and vests and take walks together,'' said Ms. Lobel, who helped inspire the tales. (At 11, she took a toad home.) ''Frog is more suave and Fred Astaire-ish, and definitely the straight man. Toad is the hysteric, but he bakes a good cookie.''</p>
        <p>Willie Reale wrote the book for the production, and Robert Reale, his brother, composed the music, which ''has a 20's and 30's Irving Berlin and Rodgers and Hart feel,'' Ms. Lobel said. Her father, who died in 1987, ''really loved Hollywood,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The production, directed by David Petrarca, is also something of a family affair: Ms. Lobel's husband, the actor Mark-Linn Baker, who has experience in playing half of an oddly matched pair from the sitcom ''Perfect Strangers,'' plays Toad. Robert Sella (''Cabaret'') portrays Frog.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lobel hopes someday to do a full staging of the musical, which will be presented without costumes but with lots of feeling. Right now, she said, ''it's in its tadpole form.''</p>
        <p>''A Year With Frog and Toad,'' today at 1:30 p.m., tomorrow at noon and 3 p.m. and Sunday at noon at the Powerhouse Theater, 124 Raymond Avenue, Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Tickets: $12. Reservations: (914) 437-5599.</p>
