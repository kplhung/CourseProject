        <p>Less than a month after the United States Supreme Court struck down part of New Jersey's hate crime law, the South Jersey man who brought the case received a lighter sentence yesterday, and may soon go free.</p>
        <p>A State Superior Court judge resentenced the man, Charles C. Apprendi Jr., a former pharmacist in Vineland, N.J., who has served 5  1/2 years of a 12-year prison term for shooting at the home of a black family in 1994.</p>
        <p>Mr. Apprendi, 45, who is white, appealed his case all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled on June 26 that only a jury, and not a judge alone, could decide whether a crime was motivated by bias.</p>
        <p>In 1995, acting in accordance with New Jersey's Ethnic Intimidation Act, Judge Rushton H. Ridgway of State Superior Court determined that Mr. Apprendi had been motivated by racial bias when he fired shots at the home of Mattie Harrell and her family, the first African-Americans to move into the neighborhood. The police said Mr. Apprendi told them he had fired the shots to give Ms. Harrell and her family ''a message'' that they were not wanted. But he later said that he suffered from an obsessive-compulsive disorder that prompted him to shoot at the house.</p>
        <p>Under the New Jersey hate-crime law, the judge's finding that bias was the motive increased the possible sentence; Mr. Apprendi was given 12 years instead of the maximum, 10 years, he could otherwise have received. Yesterday, Judge Ridgway sentenced Mr. Apprendi to seven years with a minimum of three years time served on two counts of possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.</p>
        <p>But at the brief hearing, which Mr. Apprendi attended, Judge Ridgway urged the state parole board to take up Mr. Apprendi's case as soon as possible. Arthur J. Marchand, the Cumberland County prosecutor, is supporting a request by Mr. Apprendi's lawyer, Joseph D. O'Neill, that the board reduce Mr. Apprendi's sentence to time served.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marchand said his office could not ask another jury to consider whether Mr. Apprendi had been motivated by bias. ''We would have to try the whole thing over again, and that would amount to double jeopardy,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neill said that Mr. Apprendi, who is serving his time at a halfway house in Camden, is remorseful. ''He's sorry for all of it -- from the night he became intoxicated and got involved in this until today,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''It will probably be with him the rest of his life.''</p>
        <p>After the Supreme Court ruling, Ms. Harrell, whose house was shot at, expressed disappointment that Mr. Apprendi had won his appeal and that he would probably get a lesser sentence, which she called a ''slap on the wrist'' for the pain he had caused her family. Ms. Harrell, who still lives on the same street in Vineland, could not be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
