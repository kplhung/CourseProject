        <p>The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission said today that because Deutsche Telekom was controlled by the German government, any offers it makes to buy an American telephone company would face heavy regulatory scrutiny.</p>
        <p>In response to concerns raised by many  Democratic and Republican lawmakers, William E. Kennard, the chairman, said a merger involving foreign government-controlled providers like Deutsche Telekom raised important national security and competition questions that would require close examination.</p>
        <p>For months, senior executives of Deutsche Telekom have been exploring the possibility of a major expansion into the United States. The company has made an  offer to acquire the VoiceStream Wireless Corporation for about $53 billion in cash and stock. Deutsche Telekom has also made an unsuccessful run at acquiring Qwest Communications International of Denver, and there has been speculation that it could try to make another bid for the company or others.</p>
        <p>''I believe, as you do, that the commission's approach must promote competition and maintain a secure telecommunication system for our national security,'' Mr. Kennard wrote in a letter larded with carefully-worded caveats.</p>
        <p>The letter replied to earlier correspondences sent by 30 Democratic and Republican lawmakers led by Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee. The lawmakers, including the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, and his Democratic counterpart, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, have moved to adopt legislation curtailing any deal. They have raised objections because Deutsche Telekom is 57 percent owned by the German government.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Hollings's urging, the lawmakers attached a provision to a Senate appropriations bill this week that would have the effect of prohibiting the F.C.C. from approving any American license transfers to Deutsche Telekom for a year. The measure is now pending on the floor of the Senate. Mr. Hollings has also introduced separate legislation that has gained the support of many top Democrats and Republicans that would permanently bar a deal.</p>
        <p>But other senators, including John McCain, the Arizona Republican who heads the Commerce Committee, have raised concerns that efforts by the government to block a deal could lead to retaliation against American companies doing business abroad.</p>
        <p>''Although it would be easy to envision new foreign restrictions on U.S. programming, satellite launches and the like, foreign governments' retaliation would not necessarily be confined to the telecom sector,'' Mr. McCain said in a letter to colleagues this week. ''Any foreign market in which American companies are vigorous participants could be fair game.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard's letter does not suggest that he is predisposed to outright rejection of such a deal. But it portends the prospect of a lengthy regulatory battle should Deutsche Telekom complete an acquisition of an American company.</p>
        <p>Because regulators might need more than a year to examine any proposed deals, the outcome of a review is impossible to predict since it is not even clear who would have the final say. Mr. Kennard's term is set to end next July and the next president might appoint a new chairman even sooner.</p>
        <p>Moreover, any deal would be scrutinized by the office of the United States trade representative, which would have to weigh whether trade agreements might be violated by any attempt by the United States government to block the merger.</p>
        <p>In its effort to allay growing concerns in Congress, Deutsche Telekom has recently tried to recruit some leading lobbyists here, but has not been entirely successful. Several lobbyists said they had turned the company down, in part because they represent American telephone companies with competing interests. Among the lobbying firms that recently spurned the German company is Quinn Gillespie &amp; Associates. Jack Quinn, the former White House counsel who heads the firm, said last week that it was recently approached but turned down Deutsche Telekom because it already does work for two large regional telephone companies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hollings said in a recent interview that he was not opposed to foreign investment in the United States, and, in fact, had worked hard to have foreign companies open plants in South Carolina. But he said that at a time when the United States government was moving to deregulate the telecommunications industry and foster competition, it would be both inappropriate and unfair for American companies to have to compete against a foreign government able to subsidize the operations of its telecommunications business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hollings has also taken his case beyond the F.C.C. He said that last week he personally pressed John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, to take steps to block any deal involving a foreign government.</p>
        <p>''He said he would study it,'' Mr. Hollings said. The White House has not taken a position on the matter.</p>
