        <p>Connecticut and New Jersey were among eight states that filed lawsuits today against AT&amp;T, Sprint and WorldCom, the nation's three largest long-distance telephone carriers, accusing them of misleading consumers in television commercials that offer low per-minute rates.</p>

        <p>Connecticut and New Jersey were among eight states that filed lawsuits today against AT&amp;T, Sprint and WorldCom, the nation's three largest long-distance telephone carriers, accusing them of misleading consumers in television commercials that offer low per-minute rates.</p>
        <p>The suits, filed today in the states' courts, claim that the advertisements, which feature Michael Jordan, the comedian Paul Reiser and several Looney Tunes characters, distract viewers from the fine print that briefly appears, showing the actual costs of signing up.</p>
        <p>''Essentially they have resorted to glitzy gimmicks and graphics, cartoon characters and world-class celebrities, all to confuse, deceive and distract consumers from information that is essential to their understanding the real deal on phone company services,'' said Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, in a news conference here.</p>
        <p>''Michael Jordan pitches 5 cents a minute,'' Mr. Blumenthal said, referring to a well-known WorldCom commercial in which Mr. Jordan banters with Tweety Bird. ''But hey, Michael, that's only in the evenings, or on weekends,'' he said, ''and it's only for people at their residences,'' and valid for only out-of-state calls.</p>
        <p>Connecticut was the only state to file suit today against all three companies, though the other states may file additional suits in coming months. Today, New Jersey filed suit in Superior Court in Essex County only against WorldCom, formerly known as MCI, claiming that its ''Five Cents Everyday'' commercials fail to clearly disclose the $4.95 monthly fee and calling restrictions.</p>
        <p>Connecticut and Illinois are suing Sprint, saying its commercials that promote rates from 2 to 10 cents a minute do not adequately disclose monthly fees, allowable calling times and surcharges, depending on where calls are made.</p>
        <p>Commercials for AT&amp;T, which is being sued by three states, feature Mr. Reiser pitching a rate of 7 cents per minute, while the words ''All Day, Every Day'' appear on screen. ''What was confusing is now not,'' Mr. Reiser says at the end of the ad. Mandatory monthly charges and restrictions on the low rates flash in print too small, and too briefly broadcast, to be read by any but the most careful viewers, the suits charge.</p>
        <p>Mark Siegal, a spokesman for AT&amp;T, said, ''It's long been our policy to be open and honest about fees and charges in our advertising.''</p>
        <p>In June, he said, AT&amp;T sent letters to the 28 million customers who use its basic-rate service to explain how the company charges for long distance.</p>
        <p>Lydia Steinberg, a spokeswoman for Sprint, said the company's ads were clear and accurate.</p>
        <p>WorldCom did not comment on the suit.</p>
        <p>The eight states -- which include California, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota and Missouri -- sued after months of talks between state officials and company executives, which began as early as last November, failed to produce an agreement, Mr. Blumenthal said.</p>
        <p>The companies have until late August to respond to the lawsuits.</p>
