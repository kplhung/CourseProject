        <p>Despite the confidence displayed by Gov. George W. Bush's campaign, the presidential election today stands as a very competitive contest, with ample time and opportunity for either him or Vice President Al Gore to surge ahead.</p>
        <p>At a first glance of the electoral map, opinion polls show Mr. Bush is leading in enough states to assure him an electoral college victory. But in many of those states, the governor's margin is quite slim. Moreover, Election Day is more than three months off, and the contest is entering a crucial phase where the choice of running mates and the message the conventions deliver could define the race.</p>
        <p>An analysis of opinion polls state by state, along with interviews with Republican and Democratic strategists in the campaigns and around the country, found enough crucial states that are so competitive that those midsummer events, and the fall debates to follow, could overturn the current standings in state after state. Or they could solidify Mr. Bush's position.</p>
        <p>No dominant national issue is defining the race. So if the contest remains relatively tight, the outcome in crucial states could be decided by local considerations such as Republicans in the Philadelphia suburbs deserting their party over abortion -- or by Democrats in Michigan rallying to the Green Party banner of Ralph Nader.</p>
        <p>For all the emphasis in the news media on national polls, where Mr. Bush has maintained long-standing but narrowing leads, both campaigns are paying closer attention to the outlook in individual states, because the goal for each side is to plot a path to collect the 270 electoral votes needed for victory.</p>
        <p>The state-by-state considerations are so vital that, to a large degree, they are driving the campaigns' advertising budgets and the candidates' travel schedules.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Mr. Gore's top lieutenants held a conference call to make important decisions about which states they should pump more resources into -- or not. Gore campaign officials said they had decided, for instance, not to spend as much in Illinois as they had planned because they felt confident in Mr. Gore's prospects there.</p>
        <p>Just the same, one Bush campaign official said that Mr. Bush was doing better than he expected in Arizona, Colorado and Montana and, as a result, the campaign could scale back its spending in those states.</p>
        <p>The state-by-state analysis shows that Mr. Gore is most potent along the coasts, while Mr. Bush has an inland foundation in the South and mountain states. That leaves the race to turn on several states in the industrial Midwest.</p>
        <p>For now, Mr. Bush appears safe in 18 states with 140 electoral votes, from Texas to Alaska to Virginia. Another 11 states, including Florida, Michigan and Oregon -- with a combined 138 electoral votes -- seem to be leaning his way, though many of them could easily change quickly. If all these states went for Mr. Bush, it would give him 278 electoral votes, 8  more than needed for election.</p>
        <p>The vice president looks safe in eight states, from New York to California to Hawaii, and the District of Columbia, with 134 electoral votes. Another four states, from Connecticut to Illinois, with 39 electoral votes, appear to be leaning his way.</p>
        <p>That leaves nine states, including such powers as Pennsylvania and New Jersey, as tossups. Combined, they account for 87 electoral votes.</p>
        <p>On the face of it, if Mr. Bush won all the states that are safe or lean his way, with a total of 278 electoral votes, he could win without taking any of the tossups. But while many more states are leaning toward Mr. Bush, polls and politicians agree that in several important states, the governor is barely ahead. It would not take a shift of too many voters to deny him Ohio, Missouri and Florida, and then his total would drop precipitously, to 221 electors.</p>
        <p>Neither campaign agrees with this analysis. The Bush camp still insists that the Governor is comfortably ahead. Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, said in an interview that Mr. Gore had made some progress in drawing support from Democrats who had been reluctant to support him. But he said there was no sign that he was pulling any support from Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''There's been some tightening, you bet, because he's bringing the Democrats home,'' Mr. Rove said. ''But nationally, this race has been essentially stuck at five or six points for the last four months.''</p>
        <p>Republicans have also been encouraged that Mr. Nader has siphoned some support from Mr. Gore in several states, and by Mr. Bush's strength in some historical Democratic pockets, like Minnesota. The race there is a tossup.</p>
        <p>William M. Daley, chairman of the Gore campaign, disputed the idea of even a tentative Bush advantage. ''I think it's basically a dead heat, basically where it's been for months,'' Mr. Daley said. ''People aren't into it. There's a whole slew of states out there because people aren't focused. Nothing has grabbed them yet.''</p>
        <p>But the competitiveness came through in interviews in state after state, where party heads and strategists described close match-ups.</p>
        <p>Richard Graber, the chairman of the Republican Party in Wisconsin, marveled at polls in his state showing Mr. Bush slightly ahead. ''There is a different energy and a different feel from what we had four years ago,'' Mr. Graber said. ''We were written off very early in the process. There was no money in this state. There was no TV. It was really free ride for Clinton. That's not the case'' this year.</p>
        <p>Senator Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, agreed. He said the race in his state was shaping up to be the most competitive in years.  ''It's going to be terribly close, and I think it could end up being one of the two or three decisive states,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The competitiveness of Wisconsin helped explain why that is one of 26 states Mr. Bush has campaigned in since May. Candidates spend very little time in states they expect to lose. Mr. Gore has popped up in Indiana, for example, not once since May, or about as often as Mr. Bush has traveled to Massachusetts (once).</p>
        <p>Sometimes candidates take an occasional tactical foray designed to befuddle the opposition. Mr. Gore traveled to Mr. Bush's state of Texas today not because he thinks he has a chance there but to draw free national publicity as he condemned the governor's record.</p>
        <p>And unless there is money to be collected, candidates do not venture into states that they consider sure to win. They campaign, in person and on television, in the states where they think they lead or trail narrowly. For example, starting last month, Mr. Gore began spending heavily on television commercials aimed at 18 states: Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Kentucky, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>Republicans were on the air for two weeks, went off, and then resumed the battle of the airwaves this week. Mr. Rove said the Gore commercials had no impact. ''There are now seven states where we have polling that took place before their advertising and polling that took place after,'' he said. ''And in all seven of the states, we've held ground or moved up. The only way it may have helped is to keep us from moving ahead.'' He said the advertisements were ''based on a flawed assumption that people are going to pay a lot of attention to advertising during the summer.''</p>
        <p>But Tad Devine, a top strategist for Mr. Gore, countered that the polls cited by the Bush camp were unreliable. ''That's a little three-card monte on their side,'' he said, arguing that Bush operatives made a ''terrible error in strategic judgment'' by not keep the campaign's commercials running -- and forfeited an opportunity to build bigger leads in several states.</p>
        <p>Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, disagrees with the Bush camp as well. She is conducting the largest polling operation of the year, 100,000 interviews this year in key states night after night.</p>
        <p>Dean Jamieson studied the eight states where Mr. Gore (through the financial fig leaf of the Democratic National Committee) spent at least $300,000 more than Mr. Bush (through the Republican National Committee). Those states were Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. Over all, Dean Jamieson found that Mr. Gore had gained 10 percentage points on average in those states. ''He was closing substantially,'' she said. ''It is reasonable to say the ads worked.''</p>
        <p>After months in which Mr. Bush seemed to have the advantage, national polls made public this week showed the race closer than previous surveys by the same organizations. Those national polls, with their consistent methodology, provide a rough guidelines to the contours of any presidential race.</p>
        <p>''It's close now, and the movement mainly is on Gore's end,'' said John Zogby, an independent pollster.</p>
        <p>Yet experts say today's electoral snapshot should hardly be considered definitive, since the public really is not paying much attention to the campaign in midsummer. Prof. Thomas Patterson of Harvard, a student of public involvement in politics, said his surveys showed that if people were not given a name but only asked if they had a presidential choice, half say they did not. Other polls, which offer names, find the undecided numbers as low as 10 percent. As for the numbers reflecting people's preferences, Professor Patterson said, ''I think they are soft.''</p>
        <p>Here is an analysis of the outlook in several important states:</p>
        <p>MICHIGAN -- Leans Bush. He has campaigned hard in the state, and almost all of Mr. Nader's support, eight percent in one recent poll, is coming out of Mr. Gore's base. Hostility from the auto workers and teamsters are making it harder for him to capitalize on economic issues.</p>
        <p>MISSOURI -- Leans Bush. This is always a swing state, and one that has picked a presidential winner every time since 1956, when it backed Adlai Stevenson. Bush is well-organized, and Gore has not solidified the union support.</p>
        <p>FLORIDA -- Leans Bush. But this is a wild card. Gov. Jeb Bush, Mr. Bush's brother, said in an interview that he was determined not to let his state slip through. ''I'm certainly not going to be embarrassed and have the state go the other way,'' Mr. Bush said. Nevertheless, Al Cardenas, the state Republican chairman, said he feared that Mr. Gore could pick Bob Graham, the popular Senator from the state, as his running mate, which would force a competition there. ''If Graham gives him a couple of points in Florida, in a tight race we obviously would have to work a little harder,'' Mr. Cardenas said.</p>
        <p>ILLINOIS -- Leans Gore. Brad Goodrich, the Republican Party's executive director, argues that Mr. Bush holds a slim lead and that Mr. Gore's advertisements have had no effect. But Senator Richard Durbin, a Democrat and a potential running mate, said polling information he had received from Gore headquarters showed the vice president now leading by a few points. Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago is expected to work hard for the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>OHIO -- Leans Bush. Polls in this state, which has a history of close outcomes, have see-sawed. Robert Bennett, chairman of the state Republican Party, said that while his candidate was ahead, it is not by much. He is well aware that the dynamic could change as the convention opens at the end of the month. ''We could have a blow up at the convention of some sort,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But David Leland, the state Democratic chairman, said it was no accident that Mr. Gore had ventured to the state at least nine times since the campaign began. ''We won't lose this race for lack of attention,'' he said.</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY -- Tossup. For most of the century, New Jersey has been a close state in presidential campaigns -- and usually supports the winner. Democrats say their only sure shot in the state would have been if Senator Bill Bradley had won the party's nomination.</p>
        <p>PENNSYLVANIA -- Tossup. Mr. Gore is cutting into Republican strength in the Philadelphia suburbs, while Mr. Bush is strong in the southwestern mining counties, and has a strong organization. Mr. Bush would be strongly favored if he chose Gov. Tom Ridge as his running mate, but Senator Arlen Specter fears Mr. Bush could lose support if it appeared that his reason for rejecting Mr. Ridge was the abortion issue.</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON -- Tossup. Mr. Gore got a boost this week when the Clinton Administration decided not to blow up dams on the Lower Snake River to improve the salmon habitat. The issue had been killing him in Eastern Washington where farmers depend on hydroelectric power.</p>
