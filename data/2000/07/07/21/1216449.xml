        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Jailed Unjustly, Peruvians Try to Rebuild Shattered Lives'' (front page, July 17) painfully reminds us that our daughter Lori, an American citizen, has been subjected to the same unjust imprisonment in Peru, given a life sentence for treason by a hooded military ''judge,'' without a trial, without benefit of meaningful legal counsel, and convicted on the testimony of but one man who had received a reduced sentence for his statements.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Jailed Unjustly, Peruvians Try to Rebuild Shattered Lives'' (front page, July 17) painfully reminds us that our daughter Lori, an American citizen, has been subjected to the same unjust imprisonment in Peru, given a life sentence for treason by a hooded military ''judge,'' without a trial, without benefit of meaningful legal counsel, and convicted on the testimony of but one man who had received a reduced sentence for his statements.</p>
        <p>Lori Berenson has denied all the charges against her, repeatedly claiming her innocence. The United Nations Commission for Human Rights has found that she is ''arbitrarily detained.''</p>
        <p>Like the lives of the Peruvians in your article, Lori's life has also been shattered. She has spent nearly five years separated from her loved ones and isolated from the world, incarcerated in frigid, inhumane prisons that have severely damaged her health. She is innocent. She must be released now.</p>
