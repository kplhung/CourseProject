        <p>ZUCKMAN-Dr. Leonard. 79 years old. Died July 19, 2000. Respected clinical psychologist. Admired and loved by all who knew him. A man of great compassion, strength and integrity. A warm hearted loving man with a sense of humor, a great laugh and an optomistic view of life. A loving and devoted husband and best friend to his wife Gloria. A role model and hero to his children Tina (Stanley), Donna (Marc) and Michael (Mimi). He was the best Dad in the world. Big brother, father and friend to Irving and Sylvia. A loving brother-in-law to Marty and loving grandparent to Joshua, Nikki, Chelsea, Lindsey and Jake. He will be deeply missed by all. ''In the final analysis'' that's what counts.</p>
