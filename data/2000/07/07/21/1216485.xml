        <p>The problem is chat. Not the Internet variety or the kind swapped over coffee at Rascal's Truck Stop on the highway leading into this hardscrabble town of 1,800, but huge hills of processed rock left after the lead and zinc mines closed in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>The mounds of chat, ground rock laced with lead and iron, have marked the skyline of Picher since miners began pulling minerals from dozens of mine shafts here in 1891. When the mines played out or were forced by cheaper foreign imports to close -- the last one shut down in 1958 -- 175 million tons of chat was left behind, creating a toxic moonscape encircling the town that federal officials have been trying to clean up since 1983.</p>
        <p>''We have nearly a hundred chat piles near here, some of them 100 acres wide at the base and stretching 200 feet high,'' said Philip Allen, the project manager for the Environmental Protection Agency's Tar Creek Superfund Site remediation efforts here. ''It's an enormous problem.</p>
        <p>''To do the job right could cost hundreds of millions of dollars and would probably take the rest of my career to finish,'' Mr. Allen, 42, said.</p>
        <p>Government efforts to do something about the chat piles began in earnest after a 1993 study found that 34 percent of the children tested in Picher had blood lead levels exceeding 10 micrograms per deciliter -- considered by the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention as the point at which there is a risk of brain or nervous system damage.</p>
        <p>Some children in the area tested as high as 32 micrograms per deciliter, said Dr. Bob Lynch, at the University of Oklahoma's Health Sciences Center. ''If a kid is over 10, investigations get launched. Anything over 40 requires medical intervention,'' Dr. Lynch said.</p>
        <p>But now, threatened by financial shortages and an investigation into  accusations of price gouging by one of the contractors involved, the E.P.A. is at least temporarily abandoning most of its efforts here after spending $55 million over five years, $21 million of it to clean and replace the yards of 1,537 houses in Picher.</p>
        <p>In May, the Oklahoma Legislature refused to appropriate $2.75 million in matching funds required to continue the program, although about 700 sites still remained to be cleaned up, Mr. Allen said.</p>
        <p>''We're in the process of demobilizing right now, and I expect to be out of here by next week,'' he said. A skeleton crew of three people, compared with a staff of 300 employees at its peak, will remain until officials decide whether to continue the cleanup effort next year.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 23, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the project's offices after some former employees contended that the engineering contractor, the Morrison Knudsen Corporation, had overcharged the government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen said those accusations had probably had an influence on the Oklahoma legislators' decision not to finance the next phase of the project.</p>
        <p>A Morrison Knudsen spokesman today denied any wrongdoing on the project, but declined to discuss the investigation.</p>
        <p>Brian Griffin, Oklahoma's secretary of the environment, said Picher was within a 40-square-mile area designated as the nation's highest-priority Superfund cleanup site.</p>
        <p>''In addition to the chat, we have 2,000 abandoned mine shafts and more than 300 miles of flooded underground tunnels in the area, creating an extremely dangerous water quality and public safety hazard,'' Mr. Griffin said.</p>
        <p>In January, Gov. Frank Keating appointed Mr. Griffin to head a task force to deal with issues raised by the abandoned mines, including the health effects of mine tailings, water quality, mine shaft plugging and potential uses for chat.</p>
        <p>''It makes a great road-building material when mixed with asphalt,'' Mr. Griffin said. He estimates there is enough chat near Picher to build a four-lane highway two times around the globe and that all of that chat would be worth about $500 million if it could be sold.</p>
        <p>But unfortunately, Mr. Griffin said, 80 percent of the chat is on Indian land, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which controls ownership, has placed a moratorium on sale of the chat pending further study of the health effects of using it in roads.</p>
        <p>Despite the herculean efforts of the government to clean up their yards, most of the people living in the ramshackle cottages and mobile homes of Picher remain skeptical of the chat's health hazards and seem merely amused by the project.</p>
        <p>''It was a pretty good job, but it's a big waste of money,'' said Theron Duggan, 33, who was an excavation crew manager for the E.P.A., even cleaning up his own yard in the shadow of a towering chat pile.</p>
        <p>''I've played on those chat piles all my life, and I can't see that it's affected me any,'' Mr. Duggan said.</p>
        <p>Rather than being grateful for the government's efforts, many local residents complain about the quality of the federal agency's work.</p>
        <p>Vance Reeves, 30, says the agency's workers killed four walnut trees in his yard and dumped dirt on his porch.</p>
        <p>Steven McBride said the workers accidentally paved over part of his yard while cleaning a parking lot next door. ''They done more harm than betterment,'' Mr. McBride said.</p>
        <p>Doris Smith, 75, said that since the agency ''remediated'' her property, water had collected in her yard after it rained, making it hard to garden and drawing so many mosquitoes that she could not go outside.</p>
        <p>''They've got too many workers that like to lean on their hoe handles instead of doing things right,'' she said.</p>
