        <p>Every time it appears that the Warnaco Group, the maker of Calvin Klein Jeans and underwear, has hit bottom, another shoe drops.</p>
        <p>The company announced yesterday that it would once again miss earnings estimates by a wide margin, as it also did in May. Warnaco said operating earnings for fiscal 2000 would be 26 cents to 36 cents a share, almost $1.50 less than the average estimate among analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. Last year, the company earned $1.90 a share. The company said there would be a commensurate but unspecified reduction in second-quarter net income to be announced in August.</p>
        <p>Irate investors sent Warnaco's stock down $1.8125 a share, to an all-time low of $4.9375. It is now down nearly 60 percent this year, and off 89 percent from its high of $44 in 1998.</p>
        <p>Stock analysts said that Warnaco's management team had already lost its credibility on Wall Street and that they were not surprised that the company's results were so far off the mark. ''People are analyzing the company as a distressed stock,'' said Matthew Hershberg, who follows the company for S.&amp; P. Equity Group, adding that the manufacturer is in increasingly dire straits.</p>
        <p>The news put more pressure on Warnaco's chief executive, Linda J. Wachner. When Warnaco announced a disappointing quarter in May, Leon Cooperman, who owns almost 7 percent of Warnaco privately and through his money management firm Omega Advisors, sent a scathing letter to Warnaco's board blaming Ms. Wachner for the company's problems. So far, Ms. Wachner's board has remained steadfastly loyal, but investor frustration is increasing as the stock continues to plunge.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Ms. Wachner cited a ''difficult business environment affecting the apparel industry in general'' to explain the company's shortfalls and asserted that Warnaco had  ''more than adequate cash flow to support our businesses.'' She was unavailable for further comment.</p>
        <p>Warnaco also in part blamed negative publicity surrounding a legal battle with its largest licensor, Calvin Klein, for its financial woes. In May, Calvin Klein Inc. sued to break its licensing agreement with Warnaco on the grounds that the manufacturer had tarnished the designer's trademark by producing substandard merchandise and distributing it through unauthorized stores like warehouse clubs. Warnaco has countersued Mr. Klein and his company, citing defamation and breach of good faith, and is asking for $1 billion in damages.</p>
        <p>A Warnaco spokesman said that the company now anticipated a $120 million decline in revenue this year related to the Calvin Klein publicity problems.</p>
        <p>Along with the earnings warning, Warnaco said yesterday that it had refinanced debt that was coming due later this summer. The agreements with Warnaco's creditors will extend the maturity dates of its $500 million trade credit and $600 million bridge loan until August 2002. The company would not disclose the terms of the financing. But the Warnaco spokesman said that the additional interest costs for this year alone would be $30 million, accounting for much of the estimated earnings decline.</p>
        <p>The company also announced it would take a $60 million after-tax charge in connection with closing its distribution centers in Europe and reducing its worldwide work force by 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Still, many questions about the strength of Warnaco's core business remain unanswered, at least until the company reports its full second-quarter results on Aug. 4. It cited softening consumer appetite for its sportswear as part of the reason for its earnings drop, but it was unclear which of its many brands was weak. Ms. Wachner had said previously that she was counting on the Speedo and ABS by Allen Schwartz brands to provide the company with dynamic top-line growth, and numbers for those businesses were not made available yesterday. But a company spokesman called them both ''very strong.''</p>
        <p>With the stock plunging, Warnaco may come under increasing pressure to take the company private or to strike a deal with one of its many suitors, most notably the VF Corporation, the maker of Lee jeans, which is interested in adding an upscale jeans brand like Calvin Klein.</p>
