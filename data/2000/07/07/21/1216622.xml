        <p>POGASH-Israel. Israel Martin Pogash, founder of Pogash &amp; Company, CPAs, which operated in NJ and NY for more than fifty years, died at the age of 99 on July 8 in his Palm Springs home. His wife, Sylvia Namm Pogash died a year earlier. Mr. Pogash was born in Volochisk, Russia. The eldest of 7, Mr. Pogash was the son of Minnie and Harry Pogash, an egg candler and grocer. Recognized for his mathematical acumen by his school principal, Martin Luther Cox, Mr. Pogash was skipped several grades. It became increasingly difficult for the young boy to be a ruffian when he was treated as a serious student. Lacking a middle name, Mr. Pogash took that of Martin in honor of his principal. At 13, he worked as a hat check boy at the Downtown Club, the eating place for top professionals, where he placed a hat on the head of Thomas Edison who Mr. Pogash said had a very large head. Many years later, Mr. Pogash became President of the Downtown Club. He was graduated with honors from NYU in 1922. He set up offices in Newark and later was joined by his brother David Martin Pogash, 17 years his junior. Mr. Pogash became one of the first forensic accountants, handling some of the leading cases of his day. Mr. Pogash retired at the age of 90. He was a 60-year member of Mountain Ridge Country Club and a former member of the Board of Trustees of Temple B'nai Jeshurun. He is survived by his daughters Susan Pogash of Chicago, Carol Pogash of Orinda, California, grandchildren Jacob and Rachel Wood, his sister Augusta Krumholz of Springfield, NJ and his brother, David Martin Pogash of South Orange, NJ.</p>
