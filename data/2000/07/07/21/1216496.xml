        <p>From the time the Bronx Community Paper Company was conceived, the paper-recycling venture was viewed as a model of urban manufacturing: an environmentally friendly company that would employ 400 full-time workers and create $200 million a year in revenues in a neighborhood hungry for an economic lift.</p>
        <p>After six years of increasingly costly construction estimates, the recycling plant, which would have provided newsprint to the city's newspapers, is now dead, said its developer, Morse Diesel International.</p>
        <p>''I think we originally were pretty excited about doing a project of this magnitude in New York City, with such a strong publisher base and the close availability of fiber,'' James MacDonald, development director for the Manhattan company, said yesterday in an interview. But he added, ''We had to accept reality, that it couldn't be done in the current market and in the current market conditions.''</p>
        <p>The news was no surprise to Bronx leaders, who for years had seen plans for the plant falter because of the developer's inability to secure economical financing for the project on 22 acres of the Harlem River Rail Yards on the borough's southern tip. The construction would have cost $400 million, but interest and other costs would have raised the bill to $700 million, company officials said.</p>
        <p>The plan, formed by a leading environmental group and the Banana Kelly community development group, also had detractors: some local churches and businesses charged it would increase air pollution.</p>
        <p>Morse Diesel and Harlem River Yard Ventures, which manages the 96-acre rail yard for the Galesi Group, the leaseholder on the property, blamed rising interest rates for the project's downfall.</p>
        <p>''You're talking about a financing feat that was difficult at best, and the way the bond market was turning it just wasn't feasible,'' said Anthony Riccio, senior vice president for Harlem River Yard Ventures.</p>
        <p>Charles E. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, which had been working with the New York City Economic Development Corporation to provide $300 million in tax-exempt bonds for the project, said company officials also told him this week that a volatile paper market played a role in the decision to kill the plant.</p>
        <p>The paper mill was to have been part of what has been promoted as one of the largest industrial projects in New York City in decades, the redevelopment of a once-bustling rail yard abandoned after 1971.</p>
        <p>In 1990, Francesco Galesi won a 99-year, tax-free lease from the State Department of Transportation and  set out to develop the plot near the Triborough Bridge. Today, a plant to house new presses for The New York Post is being built, and a waste transfer station and a two-mile long rail link are operating.</p>
        <p>''The paper mill has sort of been on the railroad tracks for a long time; I guess it couldn't dodge the train this time,'' said the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer. ''This would have been a really good fit, but it was not to be, and it was not to be for a whole host of reasons, not because of someone's intention or actions.''</p>
