        <p>Glasses of white wine and cups of ice-cold draft beer, two thirst-quenching staples of summer festivals, could soon become memories of days gone by on the streets of New York, as the Giuliani administration is considering banning the sale of alcohol at outdoor street parties.</p>
        <p>If the administration follows through with its plan, the ban will turn all manner of outdoor feasts -- from the Feast of San Gennaro in Little Italy to the Ninth Avenue Food Festival in Clinton -- into nonalcoholic affairs, parties at which sausage-and-pepper sandwiches and clams on the half shell would be washed down with soda, lemonade or bottled water. Violators would be ticketed under the city's open container law.</p>

        <p>Glasses of white wine and cups of ice-cold draft beer, two thirst-quenching staples of summer festivals, could soon become memories of days gone by on the streets of New York, as the Giuliani administration is considering banning the sale of alcohol at outdoor street parties.</p>
        <p>If the administration follows through with its plan, the ban will turn all manner of outdoor feasts -- from the Feast of San Gennaro in Little Italy to the Ninth Avenue Food Festival in Clinton -- into nonalcoholic affairs, parties at which sausage-and-pepper sandwiches and clams on the half shell would be washed down with soda, lemonade or bottled water. Violators would be ticketed under the city's open container law.</p>
        <p>''This is under consideration,'' said Marilyn Mode, spokeswoman for the Police Department, who said the proposal was being reviewed with hopes of ensuring that the 400 open-air festivals held in the city each year provide ''a peaceful and family-oriented atmosphere'' for all who attend.</p>
        <p>The plan has been met with surprise and consternation by organizers of festivals, some of whom said the city had recently notified them of its intentions to make the prohibition on alcohol sales a condition of street activity permits, which are required for all legal fairs and festivals.</p>
        <p>''This could have a devastating impact on our feast and on the vendors who participate in it,'' said Arnold N. Kriss, general counsel for Figlia di San Gennaro Inc., the nonprofit group that is organizing the street fair for Sept. 14 to 24.</p>
        <p>Publicly, city officials said the proposal is an extension of the city's quality-of-life campaign, from the crackdown of squeegee men at the beginning of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's first term to the more recent enforcement of open-container violations during tailgate parties at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>Privately, however, the authorities said the plan was a response to the events after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on June 11, when scores of young men attacked at least 59 women in or near Central Park. After the attacks, witnesses said many of the assailants had been drinking or smoking marijuana in the hours leading up to the sexual assaults, even though alcohol was not sold at the parade.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kriss, of the San Gennaro Festival, said the proposal seemed unreasonably broad. ''The Police Department is competent and capable and does an excellent job, and they should be able police these feasts without these kind of measures,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Prohibition does not belong in New York City,'' Mr. Kriss said. ''Prohibition ended in 1932.''</p>
        <p>Andrew Albert, executive director of the West Side Chamber of Commerce, which sponsors festivals on Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues, said that it seemed unfair to compare neighborhood feasts, and the restaurants and vendors who set up booths at them, with the men who formed a gantlet of sexually abusive behavior in Central Park.</p>
        <p>''We have never encountered any rowdiness at our fairs,'' he said. ''I don't see the correlation. I don't see the rationale.''</p>
        <p>Temporary liquor permits, which allow the sale of beer and wine at public events, are issued by the State Liquor Authority. The state issued 5,100 of the permits in the five boroughs last year. Maris Hart, the authority's spokeswoman, said she knew of no municipality in the state that had forbidden the sale of alcohol at fairs and festivals.</p>
        <p>Sunny Mindel, the mayor's spokeswoman, did not return four phone calls on Wednesday and Thursday. And Ms. Mode declined to discuss when the ban might be put into effect. But organizers said they had been told by mayoral aides that the policy would take effect on Labor Day weekend, and Mildred E. Duran, director of the mayor's Street Activity Permitting Office, said Labor Day appeared to be the target date.</p>
        <p>If the ban were instituted, it would effectively end public drinking in New York City, which the authorities said would simplify enforcement of the open-container law. The authorities also said the ban had some precedent. This year, for instance, the city refused to allow alcohol vendors at the 116th Street Festival, held in East Harlem the day before the Puerto Rican Day Parade.</p>
        <p>Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who said yesterday that he was not prepared to announce a new policy, also said that a ban would have public safety merits.</p>
        <p>''I am very supportive of it,'' he said. ''Alcohol on the streets in large crowds has great potential to cause disturbances.''</p>
