        <p>After rejecting plea deals in recent days, the two chief organizers of Salt Lake City's bid to win the 2002 Winter Olympics were indicted yesterday by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, fraud and racketeering related to the vote-buying scandal that erupted in late 1998 and threatened the future of the Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>The 15-count indictment alleges that Thomas K.

        <p>After rejecting plea deals in recent days, the two chief organizers of Salt Lake City's bid to win the 2002 Winter Olympics were indicted yesterday by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, fraud and racketeering related to the vote-buying scandal that erupted in late 1998 and threatened the future of the Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>The 15-count indictment alleges that Thomas K. Welch, 55, the former president of the Salt Lake City bid committee, and David Johnson, 41, the former vice president, paid $1 million to improperly influence votes of more than a dozen delegates of the International Olympic Committee, which awards the host sites for the Winter and Summer Games.</p>
        <p>The two ex-officials also secretly paid an official of the United States Olympic Committee to assist in Salt Lake City's bid, drew up a series of bogus contracts, falsified books, records and other documents to conceal their activities, and personally diverted $130,000 in bid committee money, according to the indictment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch and Mr. Johnson became the fourth and fifth people to be prosecuted in the Salt Lake City scandal, and according to the indictment were the ones most directly involved in the plan to win votes through lavish spending and gift-giving to I.O.C. delegates. A series of revelations about the scandal in late 1998 and in early 1999 severely damaged the Olympic movement and the credibility of the committee, and threatened to topple the committee's president, Juan Antonio Samaranch.</p>
        <p>Ten delegates either resigned or were forced out in the wake of the scandal. Late last year, acknowledging that the bid process had become corrupted, the committee instituted a policy that prohibits its members from visiting cities seeking to host Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued through his lawyer in Washington, Mr. Welch denied that he and Mr. Johnson had committed any wrongdoing. Max  Wheeler, Mr. Johnson's attorney, has said repeatedly that the two men were being made scapegoats for participating in what had become a common practice among bid cities of providing exorbitant favors for members of the I.O.C. in order to secure their votes. Both men have denied bribing any delegates.</p>
        <p>''I want to assure everyone,'' Mr. Welch said in the statement, ''that David Johnson and I committed no crime. I took no pay from the bid effort. I did not ask for or receive anything personally from the committee or from anyone else.''</p>
        <p>Last week Mr. Welch and Mr. Johnson rejected a plea deal they described as too sweeping in what they would have to admit to. Subsequent efforts by their lawyers and prosecutors to reach a deal were unavailing. In yesterday's indictment, they were charged with one count of conspiracy, five counts of mail fraud, five counts of wire fraud and four counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering. Each charge carries a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.</p>
        <p>Most of the charges have been reported previously in great detail. The one new charge that has surfaced in recent days concerned money that Mr. Welch and Mr. Johnson allegedly used for personal purposes. Jet Set Sports, a ticket and travel agent based in New York, acknowledged in a statement on Wednesday that it was cooperating with federal authorities regarding $130,000 in a series of cash payments that it made to the Salt Lake City bid officials in 1994 and 1995, before the 2002 Games were awarded. At the time, the company was seeking to become an official Olympic sponsor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wheeler has told reporters in Salt Lake City that the company made the donations because it stood to make a significant profit as an official Olympic travel broker, which it later became. Mr. Wheeler said the money was spent on bid activities, not personal enrichment. The indictment describes a series of cash payments totaling $130,000 made by a potential Olympic sponsor to Mr. Welch and Mr. Johnson at airports and hotels between August 1994 and May 1995. The 2002 Games were awarded on June 16, 1995.</p>
        <p>An independent ethics panel investigating Salt Lake City's bid concluded that officials had lavished more than $1.2 million in cash, scholarships, jobs, medical treatment, shopping sprees, excessive travel and expensive baubles to I.O.C. delegates and their families. The panel said Mr. Welch and Mr. Johnson were most to blame, but they, in turn, have said that there was widespread knowledge and approval of their activities.</p>
        <p>Since the disclosures about Salt Lake City, it has been revealed that similar bidding practices also occurred in Atlanta's securing of the 1996 Summer Olympics, Nagano, Japan's hosting of the 1998 Winter Games and Sydney, Australia's bid to win the 2000 Summer Olympics. About 30 of the I.O.C.'s 114 delegates have been linked to improprieties in bidding processes for those Games.</p>
        <p>''The idea that we defrauded the bid committee or anybody else is preposterous,'' Mr. Welch said in his statement. ''So is the charge that we bribed anybody. But that does not change the fact that we will be photographed and booked like common criminals.''</p>
        <p>Both men seemed to rule out the chance of accepting any further plea offer that might come from federal prosecutors. Current Salt Lake City Olympic officials have expressed concern that the specter of a trial will further cloud their efforts for the 2002 Games.</p>
        <p>''We and our families must go through the agony of a criminal trial on the eve of the Games because we did what we, and many other people, thought was absolutely necessary and in keeping with the ideals of the community,'' Mr. Welch said. ''We will defend ourselves and we will be acquitted, but no one can possibly understand the heartbreak and disappointment I feel.''</p>
        <p>Three people have previously been prosecuted in connection with the scandal. David Simmons, a Salt Lake City businessman, has pleaded guilty to tax offenses related to an alleged sham telecommunications job provided to Jung Hoon Kim, the son of Kim Un-Yong, a powerful I.O.C. delegate from South Korea. The son, known as John Kim, has been indicted but has left the country and is considered a fugitive by the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>Alfredo La Mont, formerly in charge of international relations for the U.S.O.C., has also pleaded guilty to tax charges related to payments he secretly received from the Salt Lake bid committee for his effort as a consultant to help secure the 2002 Winter Games.</p>
