        <p>For the Russian playwright Aleksandr Ostrovsky, all the world was quite literally a stage, and a life in the theater was the only honest life worth pursuing. In an exuberant celebration of Ostrovsky's vision that also offers a master class in acting, the Vakhtangov Theater of Moscow is presenting ''Innocent as Charged'' through this weekend as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000.</p>
        <p>Ostrovsky was a forerunner of what would become a revolution in the theater. If it was Chekhov's ax that finally brought down the cherry orchard that was 19th-century Russia, it was Ostrovsky who honed it with dozens of plays that satirized the landed gentry and provincial bureaucrats. Although immensely popular in his day (a statue of him stands outside the Maly Theater in St. Petersburg), he frequently ran afoul of the Czar's censors. That he was one of the favorites of the Communist authorities during the Soviet years possibly explains why he was seldom performed in the West.</p>

        <p>For the Russian playwright Aleksandr Ostrovsky, all the world was quite literally a stage, and a life in the theater was the only honest life worth pursuing. In an exuberant celebration of Ostrovsky's vision that also offers a master class in acting, the Vakhtangov Theater of Moscow is presenting ''Innocent as Charged'' through this weekend as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000.</p>
        <p>Ostrovsky was a forerunner of what would become a revolution in the theater. If it was Chekhov's ax that finally brought down the cherry orchard that was 19th-century Russia, it was Ostrovsky who honed it with dozens of plays that satirized the landed gentry and provincial bureaucrats. Although immensely popular in his day (a statue of him stands outside the Maly Theater in St. Petersburg), he frequently ran afoul of the Czar's censors. That he was one of the favorites of the Communist authorities during the Soviet years possibly explains why he was seldom performed in the West.</p>
        <p>New York audiences unfamiliar with Ostrovsky could ask for no better introduction than the splendidly acted and visually opulent production from the Vakhtangov that at times takes on an almost circus atmosphere as characters move in and out of the audience, wander on and off stage and interrupt dialogue with snatches of song or even, in one delightful scene, a can-can line.</p>
        <p>''Innocent as Charged,'' which is played in Russian and simultaneously translated via headphones, is an old-fashioned melodrama in structure and theme. Seventeen years separate the first act (in which a young unwed mother is jilted by the father and told that her 3-year-old child has died) and the next three acts. During the intermission that follows, the woman moves away, changes her name and becomes a famous actress. When the audience returns, it finds her appearing in the same town from which she fled, a star of the Russian stage. Naturally, the child had not died, and is now a leading actor with the local theater company.</p>
        <p>Mother and son, of course, eventually reunite. But it is not the story -- dramatic and sentimental as the denouement may be -- that earns Ostrovsky his reputation as a precursor of the modern theater. The strength of his plays, and the fascination of the Vakhtangov's fine staging, is in the playwright's concentration on character development, even in the secondary roles, and the flow of action interspersed with songs that the director Pyotr Fomenko has given this production.</p>
        <p>A behind-the-scenes story to the Vakhtangov's visit was Mr. Fomenko's refusal to join the company here, saying he was too busy with a new production in Russia and he thought the actors needed more rehearsal time. He need not have worried.</p>
        <p>This production has been a huge hit in Moscow, and it is easy to see why. The play features a cast of 13, and there is not a weak link in it. The lessons of Konstantin Stanislavsky are alive and well in Moscow.</p>
        <p>In one scene, the famous actress (the character of Yelena Ivanovna Kruchinina, given a fine performance by Yuliya Borisova) explains to her ardent admirer (Nil Dudukin, superbly played by Yuri Yakovlev) how she manages to so accurately portray night after night the agony of a mother who has lost her child. It is quite simple: she, too, has lost a child, and she calls on that experience in recreating her role. Like Hamlet's instructions to the players, Ostrovsky's actress is giving advice that Stanislavsky would expand on in developing his method of acting that would dominate 20th-century theater.</p>
        <p>Each of the actors uses small gestures or even a simple prop to build an indelible character. Yevgeny Knyazev, who is an irresistible free spirit as Grigory Neznamov, the grown lost son of the famous actress, enters with a pool cue and a long purple scarf that becomes part of his persona. For Mikhail Uliyanov, who plays Grigory's fellow actor and older sidekick, it is an old coat, hat and a decanter of vodka. And Lyudmila Maksakova, who is a joyous bundle of raw seductive energy as Nina Pavlovna Korinkina, the leading lady in the provincial acting troupe, uses a long-stemmed carnation to create a femme fatale.</p>
        <p>Although the simultaneous translation via headphones (in which one person renders all the roles) is as spiritless as a United Nations Security Council debate, Ostrovsky's humor can still filter through (as when Dudukin, presenting a gift of caviar to Yelena, observes, ''You must eat something''). However, one noticed that those in the audience not needing to rely on the translation were laughing more than those of us who were.</p>
        <p>The Vakhtangov production is spectacular to look at. Whoever paved the way for the troupe to bring its wardrobe deserves a vote of thanks. The costumes by Olga Akhmatovakaya are stunning -- richly textured silk gowns, smartly cut suits and top hats and wonderfully tattered rags. And Tatyana Selvin skaya's sets -- crocheted doilies, an old Victrola, a samovar -- are like time travel to 19th-century Russia.</p>
        <p>The opening act is played on a postage-stamp stage -- to give the feel of a cramped apartment, no doubt -- with the spectators sitting on bleacher-style benches. and The general-admission audience then has to elbow its way to unreserved seats for the second act, played in a sort of hotel ballroom atmosphere. Despite the inconvenience of moving between two venues, just watching the Vakhtangov actors is a treat for which anyone who loves the theater should be grateful.</p>
