        <p>Lawyers for the leaders of the International Boxing Federation, who are on trial for racketeering and seeking bribes in exchange for boxer rankings, said today that their clients are victims of a ''selective prosecution'' of the sport's only black-controlled sanctioning organization.</p>
        <p>They charged that in bringing the case, the office of the United States Attorney for New Jersey had made itself an ''unwitting ally of multimillionaire white promoters'' who were among the key prosecution witnesses.

        <p>Lawyers for the leaders of the International Boxing Federation, who are on trial for racketeering and seeking bribes in exchange for boxer rankings, said today that their clients are victims of a ''selective prosecution'' of the sport's only black-controlled sanctioning organization.</p>
        <p>They charged that in bringing the case, the office of the United States Attorney for New Jersey had made itself an ''unwitting ally of multimillionaire white promoters'' who were among the key prosecution witnesses. They said these promoters stand to gain greater influence over the millions of dollars involved in boxing with the discrediting of the I.B.F.</p>
        <p>In a nearly daylong summation, Gerald Krovatin, the lawyer for Robert W. Lee, the I.B.F. president and founder, said that witnesses like Bob Arum, the head of Top Rank promotions, Cedric Kushner and Ronald Weathers, who all testified that they paid illegal bribes, were walking free ''with a wink and a nod'' from prosecutors while his client was forced to undergo a three-and-half month trial.</p>
        <p>''I ask you to act as the conscience of this community and say that this man should not be convicted for conduct that others engaged in and are walking around free for,'' Krovatin  said. ''Whether you view it as racial or nonracial, it is still selective and it's not fair, and you have to say so.''</p>
        <p>Lee and his son, Robert Lee Jr., are charged with 34 counts of bribery, conspiracy, racketeering and money laundering in connection with allegedly soliciting and accepting $338,000 in bribes from managers, promoters and fighters over a 14-year period. The two face 20 years in prison if convicted.</p>
        <p>United States District Court Judge John W. Bissell is scheduled to send the jury to deliberate in the case by Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Both Krovatin and John DeMassi, the lawyer for the younger Lee, flogged the law in their summations, parsing the legal distinctions between what the prosecution called bribes and what they called ''legal gratuities'' of the kind given to letter carriers, doormen and waiters.</p>
        <p>The lawyers questioned whether the I.B.F. had any obligation to base its rankings on merit alone and painstakingly followed the trail of alleged bribes laid out by prosecutors to raise questions about whether the federal government had jurisdiction even if they did take place.</p>
        <p>The government case, said Krovatin, was ''out there on the far frontier of legal theory'' and ''vagued-up'' in a way to snare his client. Furthermore, he charged that in using the Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations act originally intended for prosecuting organized crime figures, the prosecution was engaged in overkill.</p>
        <p>But his most withering comments were reserved for the government witnesses whose ''converging agendas'' in getting rid of the I.B.F., with its close ties to the promoter Don King, were served by the government investigation which they aided.</p>
        <p>Particularly, he directed his charges at the government's main witness, Colin Douglas Beavers, the I.B.F.'s former rankings chairman, who testified that he was the bagman and distributor of the alleged bribes which the prosecution has conceded Lee never solicited or collected himself. When confronted by F.B.I. agents with the threat of arrest, Beavers became a government informant and recorded and videotaped conversations with Lee and others that figured prominently in the prosecution's case.</p>
        <p>Krovatin depicted Beavers, who is white, as being bitter at his demotion within the I.B.F. and eager to set up his own sanctioning group.</p>
        <p>He said Beavers first raised a racial spector in the case when he told Dan Duva, the late promoter and owner of Main Event and an antagonist of the I.B.F., that Lee's actions as head of the group were less about money than they were about a racial solidarity with King.</p>
        <p>Krovatin recalled a conversation that Duva taped and turned over to prosecutors, triggering the investigation: ''Beavers says to Duva, 'Don King is a black man who has made it in this business and Bob Lee has attached himself to his coattails.' ''</p>
        <p>In Krovatin's version of the case, these alleged payments were all tailored made by Beavers and others to snare Lee: the $65,000 Dino Duva testified that he made to get a fighter a better ranking; the $100,000 payment that Arum said he made through an intermediary in 1995 to get I.B.F. sanctioning of a fight between George Foreman and Axel Schulz; and the $100,000 that Kushner said he paid to Beavers on Lee's behalf for a Foreman-Schulz rematch. Pointing to Arum's testimony and inconsistencies in other evidence presented, he said the go-betweens were the real beneficiaries of the payments.</p>
