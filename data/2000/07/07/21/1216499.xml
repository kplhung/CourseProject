        <p>A 71-year-old man who died in Staten Island on Wednesday was not infected with the West Nile virus, city officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The man, a visitor from South Carolina whose name has not been released, was admitted to St. Vincent's Medical Center in Staten Island on July 5 complaining of headache, fever and confusion, symptoms sometimes associated with encephalitis, which can be caused by West Nile. He died early Wednesday at the medical center.</p>
        <p>Tissue and blood samples from the man, who was found to have encephalitis, were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, as well as city laboratories, to be tested for West Nile, largely because crows infected with the virus were found on Staten Island this month. ''Out of an excess of caution, we submit all these blood tests,'' Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said at a briefing for reporters.</p>
        <p>Although health officials said they did not yet know why the man died, they said he could have been sickened by any of several other viruses that cause encephalitis.</p>
        <p>Doctors around the city have been advised to send blood samples of patients who have West Nile-like symptoms to the city for analysis, and the city receives four to five referrals a day, said Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city health commissioner.</p>
        <p>Last year, West Nile virus sickened 62 people in the New York region, killing 7. There have been no confirmed cases in humans this year, but the discovery of the virus in mosquitoes and dead birds again this year has prompted some municipalities to begin spraying pesticide.</p>
        <p>The city sprayed two areas of Staten Island on Wednesday night. Yesterday, several environmental groups filed a federal lawsuit in Manhattan against the city, claiming that city officials violated environmental laws with the spraying effort. In their complaint, the groups argue that the city did not follow procedures called for by the Clean Water Act and other state and federal environmental laws. They have asked a federal judge to stop the  spraying program. The city has 20 days to respond to the complaint before the judge rules.</p>
        <p>The mayor brushed off the lawsuit  and suggested that protests against pesticides could contribute indirectly to the spread of disease.</p>
        <p>''Human life is at stake,'' he said. ''Their lawsuit is highly irresponsible. It creates a misleading impression and helps to contribute to the outbreak of things like this.''</p>
        <p>In Westchester County, officials planned to spray four communities last night, beginning at 11:30: North Castle, New Castle, Mount Pleasant and Pleasantville.</p>
        <p>The following 10 Westchester communities will be sprayed starting midnight on Friday: New Rochelle, Eastchester, Tuckahoe, Bronxville,  part of Mamaroneck, Scarsdale, Mount Kisco, Pound Ridge, Lewisboro and Bedford.</p>
