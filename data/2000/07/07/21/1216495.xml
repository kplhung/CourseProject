        <p>Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate, will buy CDNow Inc., the struggling online music retailer, for $117 million in cash, Bertelsmann said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The deal, worth $3 for each CDNow share, will give Bertelsmann a recognized brand in online music sales as it tries to expand its electronic commerce business. For CDNow, the merger ends the company's extensive search for a partner, which intensified in March after a merger deal with Columbia House fell through.</p>
        <p>CDNow, which went public in February 1998 at $16 a share, has stumbled in the face of increasing competition, losing $119 million last year. Its stock, which reached a high of $35.50 a share in April 1998, closed at $2.875 a share on Wednesday, the day before the merger was announced. The stock closed at $2.92 yesterday.</p>
        <p>''This is a savior for CDNow,'' said Aram Sinnreich, an analyst with Jupiter Communications in New York. ''It was clear it was in dire straits and couldn't continue doing business as usual.''</p>
        <p>The CDNow service, which allows visitors to download music as well as purchase tracks and CD's, was founded by the twin brothers Jason and Matthew Olim in 1994 and was an instant hit among music fans and technology aficionados. But the site quickly lost market share when Amazon and national music chains began selling CD's online.</p>
        <p>Despite its struggles, however, CDNow has managed to amass the single largest database of qualified online music buyers, Mr. Sinnreich said. For that reason, the acquisition instantly puts Bertelsmann, which is based in Gutersloh, Germany, at the top of the online music business. ''It gives them exactly what they haven't been able to get through their own music properties, a large database of customers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Klaus Eierhoff, a Bertelsmann board member, called the merger an excellent fit with both the company's online and traditional music assets, not only because of CDNow's music content but because of its strength in new digital downloading technologies.</p>
        <p>CDNow, whose headquarters are in Fort Washington, Pa., will continue its current operations after the merger, the companies said, becoming Bertelsmann's primary online music sales effort under the leadership of Andreas Schmidt, former chief executive of AOL Europe and current president and chief executive of Bertelsmann's new e-Commerce Group. GetMusic, an online music service that is the result of a venture between Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment and Universal Music Group, will be featured on the CDNow Web site.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Schmidt said that, among other things, the acquisition of CDNow gives Bertelsmann a huge boost in the emerging market for electronic music distribution, a hotly contested subject that has pitted musicians and record companies against Internet companies developing distribution technologies.</p>
        <p>''We want to turn CDNow into a music commerce play and expand it internationally while we expand the brand onto other platforms, like mobile and broadband,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''Clearly, all music content will be in digital form from here on.''</p>
        <p>Bertelsmann's acquisition of CDNow is the latest in a recent series of deals, which include an alliance with America Online to distribute Bertelsmann's brands over AOL, and a separate distribution deal with Terra Lycos.</p>
