        <p>''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' was shown as part of this year's New Directors/New Films series.

        <p>Tammy Faye Bakker Messner, the former wife of Jim Bakker, is that most American of stories, a figure of tragedy and a joke. It doesn't help that her face suggests what would happen if the masks of comedy and tragedy were tossed into a microwave oven and nuked into a colorful blur. The documentary ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' walks us through her life, a veritable catalog of bad marriages, lost televangelist empires, squandered relationships with children and, despite it all, Ms. Messner's indomitable optimism.</p>

        <p>''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' was shown as part of this year's New Directors/New Films series. Following are excerpts from Elvis Mitchell's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 31. The film opens today at the Quad Cinema, 13th Street, west of Fifth Avenue, Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>Tammy Faye Bakker Messner, the former wife of Jim Bakker, is that most American of stories, a figure of tragedy and a joke. It doesn't help that her face suggests what would happen if the masks of comedy and tragedy were tossed into a microwave oven and nuked into a colorful blur. The documentary ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' walks us through her life, a veritable catalog of bad marriages, lost televangelist empires, squandered relationships with children and, despite it all, Ms. Messner's indomitable optimism.</p>
        <p>The framing device -- each segment is introduced by hand puppets, echoing the chapters of the children's movie ''Babe'' -- goes a mite too far. (The puppets were probably used because Ms. Messner loves them and started her television career turning the tops of bubble-bath bottles into them.)</p>
        <p>Any movie with narration by RuPaul Charles hardly needs an extra ladle of camp; it's already swimming in it. As is so much of Ms. Messner's own story; her life could have been written by Danielle Steel and directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, with makeup tips courtesy of Sears Best Latex. No wonder she's the patron saint of drag queens everywhere. She spills her biography with the same waves of determination, honesty and glitter that made her such a compelling television personality.</p>
        <p>She initially falls in love with Jim Bakker, the boy wonder television- religious personality and perhaps the one person who could burst into tears almost as quickly as she. Later, their marriage turns loveless, but she endures. Between them, the Bakkers create and are forced out of two television ministries, the more notorious of which results in Mr. Bakker's 1989 conviction for defrauding his followers of millions of dollars. Although she tearfully stands by her man during the trial, she divorces him three years later.</p>
        <p>''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' is taken with its protagonist, a woman who made a career of living out every single moment of her life. She is the most compelling character to apply makeup with a spatula who ever stepped in front of a camera.</p>
        <p>The documentary goes through her life like a series of amiable flash cards. Anyone who saw her on ''The PTL Club'' or ''The 700 Club'' -- deep-fried exhibitionism at its most extreme -- was probably transfixed by her exhausting spectacle. It's why all the attempts to parody the Bakkers never quite worked, because no one captured them accurately. They weren't bland and polyester like the Osmonds, the other squeaky-clean icons of the era. The good old-fashioned poor-folk anguish that poured from the television screen -- Ms. Messner erased her past face with an airbrush -- was an all-new breed of extemporaneous biography.</p>
        <p>''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' cries out for a little more analysis of its subject. Instead, it joyfully wallows in the backdraft of her excesses, trailing her as she visits a network to pitch a talk show in which she would chat with teenagers, aided by puppets, and shows off her collection of dolls, all of which feature round cheeks and frozen smiles frighteningly similar to her own.</p>
        <p>The directors, Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, are awfully quick to forgive Tammy Faye's lack of self-awareness, possibly because she has a heart as big as her hair. She was one of the first in the televangelist crowd to accept gay men with AIDS. The movie makes a case for her because she's a survivor; it's more of a mash note than a formal documentary, and there's nothing wrong with that.</p>
