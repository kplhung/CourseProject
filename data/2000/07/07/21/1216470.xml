        <p>Editorial on Camp David summit talks, at which Israeli leader Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat are tackling most difficult, most emotional, issue of status of Jerusalem</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>No one knows at this point whether the Camp David meetings will eventually bring a Mideast peace agreement. This is the first time Israeli and Palestinian leaders have tackled the most difficult issues, like sovereignty over Jerusalem. But the fact that Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, decided to stay on after President Clinton's departure for Okinawa yesterday morning is encouraging. Neither man wants to walk away from the chance of ending a half-century of destructive conflict.</p>
        <p>Although a news blackout veils many details, the sharpest divisions appear to be over Jerusalem. Mr. Barak, like all Israeli leaders since 1967, has insisted that the city remain united and under Israeli sovereignty. He is reportedly open to letting Jerusalem's 200,000 Palestinians run their own civil affairs and letting a Jerusalem suburb serve as a Palestinian capital. But Mr. Arafat resists accepting permanent Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem, something no Arab leader has been willing to concede. He has left himself little room for flexibility by failing to prepare Palestinians for any sort of compromise on the city. East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war, is home to some of the holiest sites of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.</p>

        <p>No one knows at this point whether the Camp David meetings will eventually bring a Mideast peace agreement. This is the first time Israeli and Palestinian leaders have tackled the most difficult issues, like sovereignty over Jerusalem. But the fact that Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, decided to stay on after President Clinton's departure for Okinawa yesterday morning is encouraging. Neither man wants to walk away from the chance of ending a half-century of destructive conflict.</p>
        <p>Although a news blackout veils many details, the sharpest divisions appear to be over Jerusalem. Mr. Barak, like all Israeli leaders since 1967, has insisted that the city remain united and under Israeli sovereignty. He is reportedly open to letting Jerusalem's 200,000 Palestinians run their own civil affairs and letting a Jerusalem suburb serve as a Palestinian capital. But Mr. Arafat resists accepting permanent Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem, something no Arab leader has been willing to concede. He has left himself little room for flexibility by failing to prepare Palestinians for any sort of compromise on the city. East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war, is home to some of the holiest sites of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.</p>
        <p>Deals are under discussion on all other issues, including borders, the future of Jewish settlements and the return of Palestinian refugees. But the Jerusalem impasse has blocked a comprehensive accord, and neither leader wants to go home with a partial agreement, leaving Jerusalem to resolve later. That would oblige them to sell difficult compromises on other issues without a final peace.</p>
        <p>Despite these obstacles, President Clinton has worked hard to keep the talks going, persuading Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat to stay after both had written him letters saying they saw little hope of further progress. Meetings are now scheduled to continue at least until Mr. Clinton's return Sunday night. While he is away, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will lead American efforts to help the two sides bridge their remaining differences.</p>
        <p>There is no easy way to reconcile the Israeli and Palestinian positions on Jerusalem. But if Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat believed that Jerusalem was an insoluble problem, they would not have come to Camp David. With enough creativity and courage, some way can still be found to give each side enough to permit a comprehensive deal.</p>
        <p>Israelis and Palestinians feel passionately about Jerusalem, a city that carries powerful religious and national symbolism. But most people on both sides also yearn for peace. Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat still have time to work out a formula for Jerusalem and conclude the historic peace agreement that is now within their reach.</p>
