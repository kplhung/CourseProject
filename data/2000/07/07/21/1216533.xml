        <p>The old soldier, his voice cracking with emotion and his battle-shattered right hand held against his chest, pleaded with a federal panel today to finally approve the first national World War II memorial before all his aging comrades died.</p>
        <p>''We earn a lot of titles in our lives,'' said the veteran, Bob Dole, the Republican candidate for president in 1996 and longtime senator from Kansas. ''The one that I am most proud of is veteran.''</p>
        <p>He got his wish. The panel, the Commission of Fine Arts, voted 6 to 0 to approve the memorial on a spot between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall.</p>
        <p>There was emotion on both sides. Opponents of the memorial, which is to cost $100 million by the time it is scheduled to open on Memorial Day 2003, challenged its design and its location.</p>
        <p>The architecture, they contended, was of the style favored by the forces defeated by the United States and its allies in World War II. One critic, Judy Scott Feldman, chairwoman of the National Coalition to Save Our Mall, complained that the design was ''imperial and triumphal'' and was ''unacceptably reminiscent of Fascist and Nazi regimes.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Helen Fagin, who settled in the United States after being liberated by American soldiers in Poland and who serves on an advisory board that endorsed the memorial, said that it was ''very offensive, egregious and disingenuous'' to compare the design with Nazi architecture.</p>
        <p>Some critics complained that its site blocked the grand vista between the Washington and Lincoln monuments. John Graves, a corporal in the war, said he represented veterans who wanted a memorial, ''but not on that particular spot.''</p>
        <p>The monument was designed by Friedrich St. Florian, an architect in Providence, R.I. It is of stone and bronze, an oval pool flanked on two sides by semicircles of 56 pillars, one for each American state and territory during the war, which ended in 1945. It has open arches on the north and south sides, named Atlantic and Pacific, for the two areas in which the war was fought.</p>
        <p>Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, who lost an arm in the war, called himself ''a small participant in that great war'' and urged the commission to approve it.</p>
        <p>About 16.3 million Americans served in the war and earlier this year the Department of Veterans Services said 5.7 million veterans were still alive, but dying at the rate of 1,000 a day, a factor mentioned by many advocates.</p>
        <p>F. Haydn Williams, who headed the panel that selected the site, urged the commission to vote approval for ''the veterans for whom the clock is ticking.''</p>
        <p>The session began with J. Carter Brown, chairman of the Fine Arts Commission, foreshadowing the decision.</p>
        <p>''It has to be on the Mall and it has to be central,'' he said, eliminating the opponents' argument against its location. He said that Mr. St. Florian had addressed complaints about the design by placing openings in the pillars and arches, creating what he called more transparency.</p>
        <p>Representative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio, who introduced legislation calling for construction of the monument, said the location was ''appropriate and historically coherent,'' coming between the monument to the president who was the hero of the Revolutionary War that created the nation and the memorial to the president who held it together in the Civil War.</p>
        <p>Today's action was the most important step in the approval process. The last remaining hurdle is action by the National Capital Planning Commission, but it generally follows the lead of the arts commission on matters of aesthetics.</p>
        <p>One advocate was Luther H. Smith, of Villanova, Pa., who was one of the Tuskegee airmen, the black aviators who had their own unit in the segregated Army, and downed 10 German aircraft in combat.</p>
        <p>The average age of the surviving World War II veterans, he said, is 80, and he added: ''We have the right site. We have the right design. What we don't have is a lot of time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dole spoke with the emotion of the old soldier when he mentioned the sacrifices of his comrades but leavened with the irreverent humor for which he was noted in public life.</p>
        <p>He ticked off the contributors to the project and then, glancing out at the veterans in the audience, added that he had been successful in getting donations from funeral homes. ''Probably not a good thing to raise with this group,'' he acknowledged.</p>
        <p>He paused and waited for the laughter to end before adding, ''Sort of a lay-away plan.''</p>
