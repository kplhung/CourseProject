        <p>THE fresh crop of shows in museums outside New York City this summer include several about artists prominent around the same time. ''Calder in Connecticut'' at the Wadsworth Athenaeum is a homegrown affair: it includes ''Very Flat Cat,'' which he made from an old oak post that he picked up on a visit to the town of Sherman, and ''Stegosaurus,'' his 40-ton stabile, which lives permanently at the museum.</p>
        <p>Calder's contemporary, Philip Guston, is featured at Yale in an exhibition about the switch he made during the 60's from Abstract Expressionist to painter of cartoonish pictures of hooded Klansmen, garbage cans and hairy legs. Thirty years later people are still learning to see the beauty of Guston's late work.</p>

        <p>THE fresh crop of shows in museums outside New York City this summer include several about artists prominent around the same time. ''Calder in Connecticut'' at the Wadsworth Athenaeum is a homegrown affair: it includes ''Very Flat Cat,'' which he made from an old oak post that he picked up on a visit to the town of Sherman, and ''Stegosaurus,'' his 40-ton stabile, which lives permanently at the museum.</p>
        <p>Calder's contemporary, Philip Guston, is featured at Yale in an exhibition about the switch he made during the 60's from Abstract Expressionist to painter of cartoonish pictures of hooded Klansmen, garbage cans and hairy legs. Thirty years later people are still learning to see the beauty of Guston's late work.</p>
        <p>Frank O'Hara, a spokesman for American vanguard art just before Guston's transition years, is the subject of a traveling retrospective at the Parrish in Southampton on Long Island. O'Hara's urbane, anything-goes view of the world inspired this assortment of pictures, collaborative projects and curios.</p>
        <p>Yayoi Kusama arrived in the United States from Japan in the late 50's and spent a dozen years at the front edge of American art, cheerfully scandalizing people with nude happenings and installations of polka-dotted fabric phalluses. At Princeton University's Art Museum her luminous works on paper, which she made before coming to New York, are intensely colored meditations about the mysteries of the universe.</p>
        <p>If none of this intrigues you, Storm King, the sculpture park in Mountainville, N.Y., may. This season it features the English fabulist Andy Goldsworthy. (Reviews of these and other shows are on Pages 32 and 33.)</p>
