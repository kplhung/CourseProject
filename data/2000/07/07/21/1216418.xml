        <p>They wouldn't deign to in a million years, but those who deplore the adolescent vulgarity in films like ''Scary Movie'' might want to sit in on a commentary track done for the recent DVD of ''Kentucky Fried Movie'' (1977) from Anchor Bay. The important thing (only thing) to keep in mind is that John Landis made the film, really nothing more than a string of gags, the same year he made ''National Lampoon's 'Animal House,' '' the gross-out classic usually cited as a harbinger of the current mess.</p>
        <p>'' 'Animal House' was a hugely successful film, with 50 or 60 imitators,'' Mr. Landis said the other day. ''There was another one this year: 'Road Trip.' '' Early signs of the genre are apparent in ''Kentucky Fried Movie.'' A man with a solid sense of humor about himself and his work, Mr. Landis said he had agreed to the commentary only after Anchor Bay invited his collaborators, the writers Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker and David Zucker and the producer Robert K. Weiss, to participate.</p>
        <p>Much of ''Kentucky Fried'' could be plugged in about anywhere today: reclaimed oil extracted from teenagers' faces; Dino the Gorilla, who throws a King Kong-sized tantrum when it is suggested that he is impotent; fly zipping, nose picking, posterior scratching, excrement smearing. ''Now's a good time to pull the plug on that machine that's been keeping your daughter alive all these months,'' a woman advises in one of the skits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Landis was 27 at the time, and today he and his colleagues watch it all with a mix of hilarity and consternation. The Zuckers, participants in many another piece of silly business, from ''Airplane!'' to the ''Naked Gun'' movies, were an earlier version of the Farrelly brothers, makers of ''There's Something About Mary'' and the current ''Me, Myself and Irene.'' Together, they prod each other's memories, reacting in astonishment at some of the bits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Landis, sounding serious, said  the man in the gorilla suit had gone on to win five Academy Awards. All the extras are either somebody's cousin or the Zuckers, who fill in everywhere. Jerry Zucker is thrown through a wall by the gorilla. ''This guy actually went on to do porno,'' Mr. Landis said about one actor. There is plenty of sex in ''Kentucky Fried Movie,'' and of the variety present movie raters would be none too pleased with. ''That would get an NC-17 now,'' Mr. Landis exclaims during an explicit shower scene. For some reason, the video carries an R rating.</p>
        <p>On the disc the director says that when he went to make the movie, he was thrown out of every studio, so he did what everybody did: ''Look for a real estate guy with disposable income.'' In an interview he made two basic observations about outrageous comedy. First, the movie business follows the money, which is as advantageous after ''There's Something About Mary'' as it was after ''Animal House.'' Second, it's not the joke, but the audience's perception of who is telling the joke.</p>
        <p>Monty Python, for example, got away with a lot because of its perceived intellect and sophistication. '' 'Mary' is a complicated case,'' he said. ''I think it ultimately worked because of Cameron Diaz. If she wasn't in the movie, it wouldn't have.''</p>
