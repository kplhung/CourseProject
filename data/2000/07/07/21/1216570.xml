        <p>When he learned that Dan O'Brien had withdrawn from the Olympic trials decathlon with a foot injury, Chris Huffins thought someone was joking. O'Brien is the current Olympic champion and the former world record-holder, the one decathlete Huffins had never defeated.

        <p>''I didn't believe it,'' said Huffins, a native of Brooklyn who will be an assistant track coach at Georgia Tech this fall. ''It's like reading a book and you have the ending predicted and it's really stupid and you think, 'It's not supposed to end like that.' ''</p>

        <p>When he learned that Dan O'Brien had withdrawn from the Olympic trials decathlon with a foot injury, Chris Huffins thought someone was joking. O'Brien is the current Olympic champion and the former world record-holder, the one decathlete Huffins had never defeated. O'Brien has served as sort of a mirror in which Huffins has measured his own reflection.</p>
        <p>''I didn't believe it,'' said Huffins, a native of Brooklyn who will be an assistant track coach at Georgia Tech this fall. ''It's like reading a book and you have the ending predicted and it's really stupid and you think, 'It's not supposed to end like that.' ''</p>
        <p>This was the year when Huffins, a two-time national champion, figured he would finally defeat O'Brien, at the Olympic trials no less. Huffins won a bronze medal at the 1999 world championships and is expected to challenge for a medal in September at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. But O'Brien is gone from the trials and Huffins's main competitor now is himself, not any opponent.</p>
        <p>The decathlon began tonight with Huffins's two strongest events, the 100 meters and the long jump. Huffins holds the world record for the decathlon 100, 10.22 seconds, set at the 1996 Olympic trials. His personal best in the long jump, 26 feet 5 3/4  inches, is less than 2 inches shorter than the third-place finisher leaped Monday night in the open long-jump final.</p>
        <p>Huffins held first place after four events tonight, winning the 100 in 10.45 and the long jump at 25-10, and throwing the shot put 47-11 and leaping 6-11 in the high jump.</p>
        <p>''If I do my absolute best, I believe I will win,'' the 30-year-old Huffins said of the Olympic decathlon.</p>
        <p>However, his personal best of 8,694 points lags well behind the world record of 8,994 points set by Tomas Dvorak of the Czech Republic, who is the overwhelming Olympic favorite. Huffins's weakness is related to his strength -- running. While he has a  sprinter's searing speed at 100 meters, and his personal best at the nondecathlon event of 200 meters is 20.78 seconds, Huffins has run 400 meters no faster than 48.05 and the 1,500 meters in 4 minutes 51.20 seconds.</p>
        <p>This time in the metric mile is 17 seconds slower than O'Brien's personal best and appears to have become a sort of psychological hurdle for Huffins. He did not finish the decathlon at the 1997 world track championships in Athens or at an important meet in Gotzis, Austria, earlier this year, skipping the 1,500 both times. If Huffins is to challenge for a gold medal in Sydney, O'Brien said, he must learn to convert his sprinter's speed to the longer running events and to specific technical events such as the pole vault, where his best is an ordinary 16- 3/4, a foot shorter than O'Brien's best.</p>
        <p>''It's just knowing that he can compete at that level and going after the 400,'' O'Brien said of Huffins. ''He can run 21 flat in the 200 and 48 in the quarter. That has never made sense to me. And his pole-vault run is not what his long-jump run is. It should be.''</p>
        <p>This season, Huffins said he has paid more attention to running during training. He believes he is better prepared to deal with the final exhausting meters of the 400, where, according to the world record-holder Michael Johnson, ''your body is totally fatigued and wants to flop all over the track.''</p>
        <p>''All the components are there,'' Huffins said. ''In the quarter mile, it's learning how to deal with the demons in the last portion.''</p>
        <p>Growing up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, Huffins never expected to become a decathlete. When he was 11, he moved to Indianapolis to join his mother, Sandra Gay, who had studied drama and education at Fordham University and who wanted her son to concentrate on his schoolwork, not athletics. Limited to one sport, Huffins chose basketball over track and field.</p>
        <p>His mother later relented during her son's career at Cathedral High in Indianapolis, and Huffins leaped 23-6 1/2 in the long jump, reached the state semifinals at 100 meters and earned a scholarship to California-Berkeley, where he received a degree in the political economies of industrial society.</p>
        <p>He first became intrigued by the decathlon in 1991, during a redshirt season at Cal. Depending on what story is to be believed, Huffins either bragged to Coach Ed Miller, ''I can do that,'' or took Miller's suggestion that training for a decathlon would aid his sprinting, long jumping and triple jumping. ''That was a great big farce, but I was young and dumb and it worked,'' Huffins said.</p>
        <p>He scored 7,531 points in his first decathlon, thought he was awful but persisted after Miller encouraged him. His second decathlon qualified him for the 1992 Olympic trials and his third decathlon came at those infamous trials in New Orleans, where O'Brien failed to clear a height in the pole vault. Unaware that O'Brien was an Olympic favorite, Huffins said he made a friendly bet with O'Brien that he could beat him in the long jump. He was standing on a parallel runway when O'Brien missed on his third attempt to clear a height in the pole vault, failing to qualify for the Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain.</p>
        <p>Even with a successful pole vault,  Huffins finished 15th at the 1992 trials, four places behind O'Brien. At the 1996 trials, Huffins finished third. A month later, he took 10th at the Atlanta Games, while O'Brien took the gold medal. Huffins later won two national titles, but O'Brien did not compete because of injury. The 2000 Olympic trials would finally signal the changing of the decathlon guard, Huffins believed. Then O'Brien withdrew.</p>
        <p>''Everything was building to a crescendo and now it doesn't happen,'' Huffins said. But, he added, the outcome will not be altered, even if the competition has been.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the victor is going to be any different than it would have been in the first place,'' Huffins said.</p>
        <p>INSIDE TRACK</p>
        <p>DERRICK ADKINS, the defending Olympic champion in the 400-meter hurdles, advanced to the next round in the event, winning his opening heat in 49.84 seconds. . . . HAZEL CLARK ran the fastest time (2:01.78) in the women's 800. Hazel's sister-in-law JEARL MILES-CLARK (2:02.07) was second-fastest and her sister JOETTA CLARK (2:02.11) was third-fastest.</p>
