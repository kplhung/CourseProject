        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''When Child's Play Is Too Simple'' (Arts &amp; Ideas pages, July 15):</p>
        <p>The United States Public Interest Research Group recently released our fifth survey of hazards at more than 1,000 playgrounds across the country, and we take issue with your article's conclusion that creativity and fun are sacrificed to safety concerns.</p>
        <p>Each year, more than 170,000 children are injured seriously enough on public playgrounds to require emergency room treatment. An average of 17 children die every year from injuries on playground equipment. Our survey found that 80 percent of public playgrounds had surfacing that is too hard, and almost half of the playgrounds had equipment that was too high.</p>
        <p>Playgrounds don't have to be dangerous to be fun. Playgrounds with equipment at a safe height and with adequate surfacing are no less fun, and no less challenging for children.</p>
