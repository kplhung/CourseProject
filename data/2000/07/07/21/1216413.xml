        <p>Chinatown: the word implies strong identity and limiting boundaries. But that label does not communicate the rich depth of Chinatowns in San Francisco, New York, Vancouver and many other cities where Chinese immigrants have made their homes.</p>
        <p>Tonight's History Channel ''Time Machine'' presentation, ''Chinatown: Strangers in a Strange Land,'' aims to show the depth of Chinatown, ''a world that is rarely seen and even more rarely understood,'' according to the narration.</p>
        <p>To a degree that aim is achieved. The program is clearly a History Channel presentation; ''Strangers in a Strange Land'' feels impersonal, and contemporary Chinatown gets slight attention. But while the documentary is stingy with heart, it is generous with fact and offers a dense and insightful visit to these communities.</p>
        <p>''Strangers in a Strange Land'' mixes contemporary videography with archival stills to document the Chinese experience in Chinatowns, described in voice-over by the actor Monte Markham as both ghettos and havens for their residents. Beginning with the first major wave of Chinese immigrants during the California Gold Rush of the mid-1800's, the documentary describes the combination of American discrimination and Chinese heritage that led to the development of Chinatowns.</p>
        <p>The discrimination provides especially compelling material. Chinese gold miners, for instance, faced taxes not levied on Caucasians for the same work. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act for a time suspended legal migration to America; later, immigrants were held in internment camps, which are shown in the documentary as they appear today. Facing such discrimination, many Chinese-Americans sought refuge in communities of their own.</p>
        <p>Chinese cultural life also led immigrants to bond, the documentary explains. An array of contemporary Chinese-Americans -- storekeepers, detectives, lawyers and authors -- explain how the traditional associations and tongs, complex units of Chinese community life, served as organized touchstones for their ancestors and themselves.</p>
        <p>The documentary aims to praise, not bury, these Chinatowns, but it does note their defects. Stories are told of gang wars in the 1980's in New York's Chinatown. The negative side of a passion for gambling is also described, as are the traditions that keep many Chinese-Americans bound to a narrow range of job opportunities.</p>
        <p>Mostly, however, the documentary admires its subjects, describing contemporary Chinese-Americans as a ''model minority.''</p>
        <p>''Strangers in a Strange Land'' is skimpy with personal portraits; the program sticks to a broad historical canvas, expressing general truths of the American immigrant experience. But though it emphasizes the extraordinary, the documentary more memorably depicts the ordinary: food markets that draw enthusiastic cooks, outdoor tai chi sessions with an intergenerational mix of participants and celebrations that promote the pride and interdependence of families.</p>
        <p>That, the program implies, is the hidden truth of Chinatown; it is a place where residents hold off assimilation to hold onto their culture in the face of forces both attractive and overwhelming. As one resident  puts it, ''It's a small-town feeling in a large city.''</p>
