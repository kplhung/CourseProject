        <p>Connecticut can't really be considered out of town, frequented as it has been over the years by New Yorkers seeking a break from urban life. While the New York art scene simmers down for the summer, Connecticut museums offer a kaleidoscope of exhibitions that range from American Impressionism of the 19th century to video imagery for the 21st, with Connecticut itself or art produced there as a prime subject.</p>
        <p>You can see riches from London and local sources in New Haven and Greenwich, visit a sprightly Calder display in Hartford, explore the art of the video screen in Ridgefield, and in New Britain follow part of the American Impressionist Art Trail, which winds through the state. What's more, for the most part you're in green country, where outdoor pleasures complement the art inside. Here is a rundown of some art shows that give added dimension to Connecticut as a summer experience.</p>
        <p>Wadsworth Athenaeum</p>
        <p>Of Calder shows there is no end. But just when you think you've seen enough of the wizard's work for a while, along comes another irresistible opportunity. Such is the case with ''Calder in Connecticut,'' at the Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford, a banquet of more than 150 objects, including letters, photos and sketches.</p>
        <p>The Pennsylvania-born Calder (1898-1973) established a home and studio in Roxbury in 1933. What's different about this show is that all of it is drawn from Connecticut sources. Eric M. Zafran, its curator, proposes that Connecticut influenced the style and content of Calder's work in many ways, from the rolling terrain of its hills to the flora, fauna and climate there. To boot, the artists, collectors and friends with whom Calder surrounded himself in this rural retreat of Manhattan culturati helped stimulate and shape his ideas.</p>
        <p>Works on view range from the monster orange stabile ''Stegosaurus'' (1973), 50 feet high and weighing 40 tons, a permanent installation on the Athenaeum's grounds, to his first wood sculpture, the small ''Very Flat Cat'' of 1926, a reclining feline made from an old oak post found on a visit to a friend in the hamlet of Sherman. Paintings, drawings, rug designs, jewelry, toys and personal mementos -- many of them gifts bestowed by the artist -- augment the fancy-free mobiles and stabiles in which the show abounds.</p>
        <p>Calder's connection with the Wadsworth was for life. His work first appeared there in a 1935 show at the invitation of the museum's dynamic director, Chick Austin. Of the three entries in that show, ''Little Blue Panel'' (1935), an electrified mobile in which a spindle and two balls rotate at different rates, was bought by the Athenaeum for $75. One of the first Calders to enter a museum collection, it is in the current show, still doing its little act in an overall brilliant presentation.</p>
        <p>Yale University Art Gallery</p>
        <p>An important artist from Calder's era was Philip Guston (1913-1980), whose work shares the spotlight with two other exhibitions at the bustling Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven. In 1967 Guston made a shocking transition from his established mode of lyrical Abstract Expressionism to figurative painting of a cartoony, often bizarre nature that made some critics gag. But Guston, ''tired of all that purity,'' wanted to try his hand at what he called storytelling.</p>
        <p>This small but stimulating show explores the four-year period of his transition, focusing on an ''alphabet'' of individual images he developed for his new work: Klanlike hoods, bricks, cups, clocks, picture frames, an easel and so forth, each painted on a small panel. The crudity of the images is offset by lush painting and a robust color sense.</p>
        <p>A few of the full-scale canvases that Guston worked his alphabet into are on view, like ''Riding Around'' (1969), in which three Klannishly robed figures with big cigars tour the city in a menacing black open jalopy. Some of his earlier Abstract Expressionist works from the 60's are also displayed. Altogether the show gives an illuminating glimpse of the work of an artist courageous enough to make a drastic change.</p>
        <p>It's a long way spiritually from Guston to Gothic Revival, but physically, just a step. The first-floor galleries also house ''Modern Gothic: The Revival of Medieval Art,'' an exploration of Gothic Revival architecture in the United States and Britain from 1830 to 1875. About 100 objects -- paintings, sculptures, architectural drawings and models, along with furniture and decorative objects -- are on display, including the work of American talents including Alexander Jackson Davis and Richard Upjohn and the British architects A. W. N. Pugin and Sir Charles Barry.</p>
        <p>Gothic Revival came about from the yearnings of some scholars, artists and clergymen for the purity of pre-Renaissance days. The show focuses on the style as it was used in houses, churches, civic buildings and universities (including, of course, Yale), and on the patrons who commissioned it and the reasons they did. Anglophilia, the novels of Sir Walter Scott and the appeal of picturesque ruins were some factors that influenced Americans, as seen in a rendering of Lyndhurst, the medieval-looking stronghold in Tarrytown, N.Y., originally designed by Davis in 1838 for a General Paulding and redone by him around 1865 for George Merritt, a wealthy New York businessman.</p>
        <p>A useful feature is that the exhibition catalog is a guide to Gothic Revival architecture still standing in the Northeast, combining architects' drawings with modern photographs and even providing itineraries. So even after it closes, this show goes on.</p>
        <p>New Britain Museum</p>
        <p>The New Britain Museum of American Art is a prime stop on the so-called Impressionist Art Trail, a group of Connecticut museums with significant collections of American Impressionist art. So it is altogether fitting that the museum has mounted what it calls the first major treatment of Connecticut Impressionists in several decades, with no fewer than half the 70 paintings in this mixed bag of a show drawn from its permanent collection.</p>
        <p>Before the turn of the century, the shoreline art colonies in Connecticut -- Cos Cob, Lyme and Mystic among them -- were a hotbed of artists influenced by the French movement. Those who either lived in Connecticut or spent extensive periods there included Childe Hassam, Julian Alden Weir, John Twachtman, Theodore Robinson and Willard Metcalf, but there were plenty of lesser-knowns as well as later also-rans who produced weak American translations of the work of their French predecessors. The trouble with this show is that it includes too many of the latter, with the time line going all the way up to the 1950's, well past the golden age of American Impressionism.</p>
        <p>Hassam, whose work looms large here, is best represented by a big oil, ''On the Way to the Grand Prix'' (1887), a Paris scene of horse-drawn carriages carrying fashionable revelers. A couple of black-and-white etchings and lithographs uphold his reputation as a printmaker. Weir, whose work is the subject of a comprehensive show at the Bruce Museum, shines with ''Windham From Mullins Hill'' (circa 1895), a lyrical rural landscape.</p>
        <p>Other highlights include ''Noank, Conn.'' (1905) by Walter Griffin, a peaceful late afternoon scene on the water in pale blue light, and two lovely floral still lifes (circa 1885) by a little-known artist, Charles Ethan Porter, inspired by the French painter Henri Fantin-Latour. ''A Moment's Rest'' (undated), a poignant but light and airy rendition of a mother watching her sleeping child, is the work of another artist whose name rings few bells today, Louis Paul Dessar. Although a bit late in the game, Ernest Lawson's large ''Spring Tapestry'' (1930), a thawing landscape seen through a screen of bare trees, makes a good Impression.</p>
        <p>In short, this overly ambitious anthology offers the good, bad and indifferent. A little editing would have helped.</p>
        <p>Bruce Museum</p>
        <p>Another stop on the Connecticut Impressionist Art Trail, the lively Bruce Museum, has zeroed in on the work of Julian Alden Weir (1852-1919), whose Weir Farm, his home and studio straddling Ridgefield and Wilton, is now a National Historic Site. ''A Connecticut Place: Weir Farm, an American Painter's Rural Retreat'' displays more than 70 paintings, some by prominent artists who visited him there, among them Hassam, Twachtman, John Singer Sargent and Albert Pinkham Ryder.</p>
        <p>Weir, who began as an academic painter and whose Impressionist phase lasted only a decade, starting about 1890, is also represented with some of his friends in the ''Connecticut Impressionists'' show at the New Britain Museum. He acquired the farm in 1882, and it became not only a beloved refuge from city life but also the subject of more than 250 of his paintings.</p>
        <p>Outstanding among those shown at the Bruce in Greenwich are ''Lengthening Shadows'' (1887), a view along a winding path framed by young trees to a sunny hilltop; ''Landscape: Branchville, the Palace Car'' (early 1890's), a softly lighted springtime reverie that includes a small shack on runners, known as the Palace Car, that was drawn by oxen to different painting sites; and the strongly brushed ''High Pasture'' (1899-1902), a gentle, summery impression of rolling land, trees and shadows that tilts toward abstraction. In his painting Weir never strayed far from the figure, and a few figure and portrait subjects are also shown here, but the focus of the show is rightly on landscape.</p>
        <p>In a nearby gallery ''Earth's Elusive Shores: The Art of Mapping After 1500'' provides a fascinating look at how mapmaking evolved after Gutenberg's invention of movable type, the voyages of Columbus and other Europeans and the translation of Ptolemy's second-century ''Geographia'' from Greek into Latin. The nearly 50 maps on view from the 16th and 17th centuries range from crude, ill-informed endeavors to models of accuracy for their day. They include treasures like Heinrich Bunting's cloverleaf world map of 1581 with Jerusalem as its center, and ''Atlas of the Whole World'' (1570) by Abraham Ortelius, famed for its beauty and fidelity to known fact.</p>
        <p>Aldrich Museum</p>
        <p>Eleven artists, some well known, some not, present videotapes and mixed-media installations in this live-wire (to use an old-brain term) show, meant to explore how the wily video medium can affect the viewer's sense of time. ''Speed of Vision'' is the Aldrich's first full video show, and to put the concept across, the Ridgefield museum has divided itself into three ''time zones'': slow motion, real time and hyperspeed. Hold on to your hat.</p>
        <p>Definitely on the slow-motion side is Nam June Paik's ''Buddha Watching TV'' (1974-2000), a rare event in this artist's manic work. A Buddha head, half buried in dirt, is in front of a television monitor on which a similar Buddha head appears. The two eye each other motionlessly, presumably until the end of time.</p>
        <p>Hovering on the very edge of hyper is Charles Atlas's ''Martha, Martha, Martha, Martha, Martha,'' a tribute to the choreographer Martha Graham. In it shots of Graham and dance images from every source you can think of, including a series of nightclub events previously devised by Mr. Atlas (even Martha Stewart appears, presumably because of her name), are made into a five-monitor collage that beguilingly blitzes the viewer.</p>
        <p>The better attractions also include Annika Eriksson's deadpan ''Connecticut Firefighters Pipes and Drums,'' a tape of a community marching band in full regalia performing with military precision, projected at movie-screen size in the same gallery where it was shot, and Matthew McCaslin's ''Bloomer,'' a 12-monitor speeded-up spectacular in which flowers appear as buds that, in split-seconds, miraculously burst into bloom.</p>
        <p>Not to be passed up either are Jonas Akerlund's ''Ray of Light,'' in which, to music by Madonna, the passage of a frenetic 24-hour urban day is compressed into five minutes of fly-by imagery, and Doug Aitken's powerful ''Diamond Sea (Linear Version),'' a rhythmic photographic essay on the desert, coast and well-guarded diamond mines of Namibia.</p>
        <p>Give it real time; by and large ''Speed of Vision'' is more rewarding than not.</p>
