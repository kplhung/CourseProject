        <p>SPIVAK'S back and Sklaver's got her.</p>
        <p>O.K., O.K., so the phrase doesn't resonate like ''Gable's back and Garson's got him,'' a slogan famous among movie marketers that promoted ''Adventure'' in 1945 with Clark Gable, returned from duty in World War II, and Greer Garson.</p>

        <p>SPIVAK'S back and Sklaver's got her.</p>
        <p>O.K., O.K., so the phrase doesn't resonate like ''Gable's back and Garson's got him,'' a slogan famous among movie marketers that promoted ''Adventure'' in 1945 with Clark Gable, returned from duty in World War II, and Greer Garson.</p>
        <p>The Madison Avenue version involves Helayne Spivak, a well-known copywriter who has worked at several large agencies like Ammirati Puris Lintas, J. Walter Thompson and Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising. Ms. Spivak, who left the big agency world in October 1997 when she resigned a top creative post at Thompson, is joining David Sklaver and his partners at the Artustry Partnership in New York, a shop that provides creative and strategic services to advertisers seeking to work outside the realm of traditional agencies.</p>
        <p>At Artustry, which brings together talent on an ad hoc basis for each client project, Ms. Spivak, 48, will be a creative partner, joining the three executives who founded the shop in fall 1998. They are Mr. Sklaver, who has worked at large agencies like DDB Needham and Wells BDDP; Bob Giraldi, who directs and produces commercials when he is not running restaurants; and Bill Perna, who is a longtime broadcast production executive.</p>
        <p>Artustry is emblematic of the remaking of the advertising industry as alternatives spring up to the standard full-service agency. The trend is accelerating as the big agencies become bigger and some senior executives like Ms. Spivak and Mr. Sklaver strike out for the less formal environments they praise as less bureaucratic.</p>
        <p>''This is an opportunity to do what I like and do well,'' Ms. Spivak, said in an interview on Monday, ''and to work with people who have been through the agency grind and found a better, more sensible way to work.''</p>
        <p>''Big agencies were following the structure of big clients,'' she added. ''But with many clients going in a different direction, it's more like how the business was, more entrepreneurial.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Spivak said the cooling of her ardor for large agencies was unrelated to the unhappy end to her most recent stint at one. In July 1999, Ms. Spivak sued Thompson, part of the WPP Group, where she had served for 13 months as one of three worldwide creative directors. The lawsuit, filed in New York State Supreme Court, originally sought $25 million in damages on the grounds of defamation and gender discrimination; it was later narrowed to gender discrimination and the sum was reduced to $13 million.</p>
        <p>But in February, after a six-day trial, a jury dismissed her claims, though she was not asked to repay Thompson $65,000 -- part of a $260,000 signing bonus -- as the agency had requested because she left before her three-year contract had expired.</p>
        <p>''I'd had opportunities'' to work again at large agencies, said Ms. Spivak, who has been heading her own company, HRS Consulting, since leaving Thompson, where she worked for big shops like those owned by Euro RSCG Worldwide, part of Havas Advertising.</p>
        <p>''There may be a network I might not be able to approach if they're that sore about a little lawsuit,'' she added, laughing. Her reference was to WPP, which has actually grown larger since the suit was dismissed, having agreed to acquire Young &amp; Rubicam.</p>
        <p>''But I worked there already,'' Ms. Spivak said of Y.&amp; R, adding: ''The only thing I miss about big agency life is dental coverage. I'm enjoying myself. There's no knot in the stomach.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sklaver, who joined Ms. Spivak for the interview, said: ''Helayne and I have a very similar view of the large agencies. They're running a process for certain large clients, and there's a role for that. But we run on a production company model; we solve problems for clients in days and weeks and get paid in fees and retainers. And there are more and more people who want to work this way.''</p>
        <p>Marketers now working with Artustry include several dot-coms, like  Cityrealty.com, OneTravel.com and Starchefs.com. The agency also recently completed a branding campaign on behalf of Disney Televentures for Americast cable.</p>
        <p>And Artustry ''just beat out'' two large agencies for ''a major assignment,'' Mr. Sklaver said, to help create an identity and image for a new company being formed from PricewaterhouseCoopers to be named Unifi Network.</p>
        <p>For Unifi, which will operate as an independent consulting company in the human resources field, Mr. Sklaver said, Artustry is ''handling everything from branding to logo work to corporate identity'' as well as advertising; a campaign is now being tested. All told, Unifi plans to spend ''north of $30 million in total,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Here's hoping the Spivak-Artustry pairing turns out better than the Gable-Garson matchup in ''Adventure.'' After all the ballyhoo about Gable being back and Garson getting him, few moviegoers got themselves to theaters and the film failed at the box office.</p>
