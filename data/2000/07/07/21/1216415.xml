        <p>Last New Year's Eve the unexpected happened. Cities everywhere planned pyrotechnic and other elaborate public displays to celebrate the millennium individually, but what evolved was a confluence of ancient rituals linked across time zones as the new year repeatedly unfolded out of darkness on television screens around the world. From the first torches lighted on South Pacific islands to fire dances in the Judean Hills in Israel and flames on the Thames in London, a global community of viewers was mesmerized not by technological razzmatazz but by age-old ceremonies featuring the primal elements of fire and water.</p>
        <p>Among the most evocative of these quasi-primitive rites anywhere was an artist's installation called ''WaterFire Providence.'' But when throngs promenaded along the banks of a cove in the Woonasquatucket River that memorable evening to view the braziers of burning logs reflected in the dark waters, they had more to celebrate than the millennium. For only a few years before, the city had regained its rivers by rescuing the Providence River from under generations of road decking and relocating its confluence with the Moshassuck and Woonasquatucket that flow into it at a strategic juncture near a new inner harbor at the cove called Waterplace Park.</p>
        <p>In place of polluted waters and a dead ''downcity,'' as the business district is called, Providence has become more like those vibrant European cities with rivers running through them and picturesque bridges joining the two banks. Suddenly buildings that were previously on back streets, like the cluster that forms the Rhode Island School of Design's campus, found themselves looking out on riverside greenswards.</p>
        <p>Three major department stores have appeared as part of the new downtown Providence Place Mall designed by Friedrich St. Florian, an architecture professor at the school, with a view of Waterplace Park through a three-story-high Winter Garden. (The railroad tracks that divided the city have also been permanently detoured to a new station, with the old Union Station as the centerpiece of another attractive development.)</p>
        <p>Now, as families escape to Cape Cod and other New England vacation spots, it has become de rigueur to stop in Providence on the way for a summer weekend featuring as its centerpiece one of the many Saturday night reprises of WaterFire, with its haunting musical accompaniment, along with dinner at a riverside cafe with a view of the fires or a quick turn at an instant outdoor ballroom on a nearby plaza.</p>
        <p>During the day tree-lined Benefit Street on College Hill near Brown University is still one of the most beautiful historic districts in the country, with its four centuries' worth of major domestic architecture: colorful clapboard Colonial houses along with Federal, Greek Revival and Victorian mansions. And the RISD Museum (pronounced RIZ-dee) never ceases to amaze with its exotic exhibitions plumbed from the depths of a collection that represents its well-traveled donors.</p>
        <p>Voices in the Fire</p>
        <p>When William D. Warner, a local architect and planner, masterminded the uncovering and rerouting of the rivers, he also designed the 12 new bridges, including 5 for pedestrians only, that appear to have been there for eons, so well does each one blend with the period of its neighboring buildings. The iron arch of one brick bridge echoes the main gates of Brown University just up the hill and serves as a kind of processional entry to its academic halls. Painted tiles inlaid into bridge walls recount with maps and images the history of the adjacent areas for a self-guided tour along the riverwalks, which themselves feature linked bollards and piers as true remnants of riverlife.</p>
        <p>When the work was completed, Mr. Warner left protruding in the middle of the Providence River a series of granite piers that had supported decking over one section of the river. ''I thought these would make appropriate bases for sculpture designed by students at RISD,'' he said. Little did he know then of the glorious future in store for these stolid cubes as torchbearers.</p>
        <p>Their presence eventually fired the imagination of the artist Barnaby Evans, a 1975 graduate of Brown, who first created WaterFire in the small cove up the river as a public artwork that would, in his words, ''invite people back to celebrate the city as the core of civilization.'' Although he originally intended WaterFire as a one-time happening on First Night 1995, after the following performance, in 1996, Joan Slafsky, a prominent arts supporter who was among those encouraging him to produce it regularly, spearheaded the fund-raising that established WaterFire as integral to Providence's community and cultural life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Evans likens WaterFire to his Southwestern childhood experience of sitting around a campfire in the desert with his family at twilight. As the evening wore on, he would listen to the intimate murmur of voices in the fire glow that dwindled to embers under a vault of stars. In a sense WaterFire recreates this campfire mode for the thousands who gather along the riverwalks, as they did on a midsummer Saturday night, to participate in this theatrically timed event. The braziers are lighted during the last glimmer of daylight on designated evenings and burn until 1 a.m.</p>
        <p>The artist envisions this glittering stream of firelight on water as a kind of preverbal experience that appeals on many different levels to children and art historians alike. Everyone merges individual memories with the visual reality of the 97 metal braziers that illuminate the central spine of the rivers. Set 20 to 35 feet apart, the braziers are neatly stacked with fragrant pine and cedar logs from storm-felled trees that could no longer be salvaged.</p>
        <p>For one visitor they recalled the moment at an outdoor Noh performance in Japan when the Buddhist priests ignited braziers to light the stage at cherry blossom time. The magical simplicity and beauty of the crackling fires reflected in the water belie the complex preparations that make WaterFire possible and that add to its charmed and quiet atmosphere.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Evans and his staff, 140 volunteers are on board for the occasion, most of them silently plying the quiet waters in flat-bottom barks heaped with wood to stoke the pyres. (With a nod to fire mythology, the boats are appropriately named Prometheus, Daedalus, Icarus and Athena.) Dressed entirely in black like the Japanese Bunraku puppeteers who disappear onstage behind their colorful puppets, the volunteers are choreographed in how to place each log in turn with the simple gesture of an outstretched arm as the boats glide stealthily by the blazing braziers.</p>
        <p>Occasionally a Venetian gondola traversing the waters would be silhouetted against the firelight. Waves of people jamming the riverwalks briefly vanish into dark passageways under bridges illuminated by candle-lighted chandeliers. Others crowd riverside restaurants for a close-up view. In brief, the bateaux-mouches that brighten the Seine at night in Paris don't have a patch on the communal ceremony that is WaterFire.</p>
        <p>Further aural enchantment is provided by taped music that resonates across the waters, with selections made anew by Mr. Evans for each performance and listed in the evening's program. To reflect the worldwide cultures represented by the spirit of WaterFire, he combines Buddhist chants with Armenian folk songs and compositions by the contemporary Estonian composer Arvo Part with Maria Callas singing an aria from ''La Wally'' by Catalani.</p>
        <p>There was a moment after midnight when Luciano Pavarotti boomed ''Nessun dorma'' from Puccini's ''Turandot,'' and everyone appeared to stand stock still at Waterplace Park to listen and gaze at the panorama of firelight against the glittering lights of Providence's new skyline. Never was a city better named to reflect cultural and artistic freedom than at that moment, which also reflected Roger Williams's original vision when he founded the city for religious freedom in 1636.</p>
        <p>As a way of drawing the crowds into the adjoining side streets and plaza, Mr. Evans also invented the outdoor Sovereign Plaza Ballroom for WaterFire nights. By hanging red drapes behind an arcaded building facade and lighting the decorative stone Turk's head above, a glamorous instant ballroom was created with a polished black octagonal dance floor over the cobblestone street. With lessons given before sundown, couples danced the night away by tangoing to live music on one WaterFire night. Other WaterFire performances will also feature dancing this summer from swing and salsa to waltzes and fox trots. No one goes home unhappy.</p>
        <p>Nightlife in Providence is complemented by a rich cultural program of daytime events to experience before the David Hykes's ''Hallelujah'' signals the lighting of the first torch of WaterFire at sunset. In addition to its excellent permanent collection of arts and artifacts, the RISD Museum is featuring two summer exhibitions that take traveling as their subject.</p>
        <p>The first, ''The Far Traveler,'' follows the history of travel in the 19th and 20th centuries through fashions specific to modes of travel (automobile, railway, steamship and airplane) along with the decorative and functional objects (portable desks and wardrobe trunks) that were necessary conveniences. By combining these displays with paintings and prints, the show represents the depth of the museum's stores.</p>
        <p>Wanderlust and Mansions</p>
        <p>Last year the museum was offered a collection of clothes selected for Virginia Hardesty Moss by Glamour magazine when her essay won the magazine's prize trip to Paris and London in 1948. This donation sparked the exhibition, which evokes a long era when travel dress -- from early motoring coats and veils (1905 and 1906) to a Vera Maxwell Ultrasuede suit (1974) -- was considered stylish as well as practical.</p>
        <p>Nothing nowadays among the jeans-clad populace can touch Moss's red flared coat and leopard-skin beret in a wardrobe that also included a ''big occasion'' dress with a velveteen jacket that one could walk away in today. Evidently she had a wonderful time, and ''Madame Schiaparelli even gave her a blouse in Paris,'' said Madelyn Shaw, the curator.</p>
        <p>''Tokaido: The Lure of the Open Road in 19th-Century Japan'' equally abets wanderlust through Abby Aldrich Rockefeller's suite of Hiroshige prints following the Eastern Sea Route between Edo (now Tokyo) and Kyoto. By studying the prints in sequence, the viewer gets into the spirit of the trip, which proceeds past tea stands and inns and sometimes across fields under a full moon or over bridges where feudal lords are given the right of way. In another example of RISD's strengths, a circa 1900 fragment of tie-dyed cloth in indigo on view in the gallery very nearly matches those displayed in stores in a print of Narumi, where travelers bought the famous local products as souvenirs.</p>
        <p>Not far from the museum are two major historic mansions that demonstrate the great wealth and enterprise of early Providence citizens. The interior of the 1865 palazzo-style Gov. Henry Lippitt House on Hope Street is one of the best examples of local workmanship, both in the Herter-style decorative woodwork and in the faux-wood and hand-stenciled finishes on walls and ceilings executed by church decorators. On a weekend  afternoon, it was the scene of a private summer wedding that gave the house a certain elegant panache of reality that it deserves.</p>
        <p>The 1786 late-Georgian house on Power Street built by John Brown, a great China Trade merchant from the family that eventually financed Brown University, possesses one of those wonders of Providence furniture design, a rare nine-shell, blocked-front bookcase and desk, as well as many treasures from the East.</p>
        <p>Equally historic in the present is the carriage house across the street where Providence's longtime mayor, Vincent A. Cianci Jr., lives surrounded by massive plantations of red impatiens that harmonize with the brick surrounds. Mayor Cianci is the enlightened spirit and dynamic force behind Providence's revival. When he dined with friends at the riverside Cafe Nuovo during the last WaterFire, he said how much fun it was to be mayor and see the rivers reborn.</p>
        <p>''The problem with America is that we do not appreciate our cities enough,'' he said, criticizing suburban sprawl. His next project? ''I am going to run I-95 out of town, so that we can heal and rebuild our neighborhoods.''</p>
        <p>There's more to come in Providence.</p>
