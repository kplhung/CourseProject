        <p>THE chorus to an old John Prine song asks, ''Wouldn't we be in good shape/if our lives were on videotape?'' We shouldn't have to wait too much longer for an answer, since it often seems these days that no aspect of our private and communal lives is shielded from the patient, prying lens of the video camera -- though the tape itself, in the digital era, may soon be obsolete. From amateur pornography to security surveillance loops, from home movies of weddings, childbirths and family reunions to C-Span and ''Big Brother,'' video records and shapes what we know of reality. It takes our confessions, tells our secrets and presents our public rituals of shame and celebration. So, what kind of shape are we in, anyway?</p>
        <p>One place to look for an answer might be at the New York Video Festival, which opens tonight and runs through Thursday at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. The ubiquity of the medium makes this year's festival, part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000, especially interesting. It also may present the programmers, the audience and the video artists whose work is being shown with a newly acute challenge.</p>
        <p>What distinguishes video as an art form -- which often presents apparently undigested slices of quotidian experience in grueling real time -- from video as a tool for making family albums or catching shoplifters, which does the same thing? For that matter, what separates video from the movies? Recent films like ''Chuck and Buck,'' ''Time Code'' and ''Thirteen'' exploit the rough textures and bumpy rhythms of video to create effects of unnerving intimacy similar to those found in many of the festival's offerings. The awarding of this year's Palme d'Or at Cannes to Lars von Trier's ''Dancer in the Dark'' raised the possibility that digital video may come to the rescue of auteur cinema, but Mr. von Trier's work also decisively blurs the distinctions between cinema and its protean stepchild.</p>
        <p>Which is, all in all, a good thing, or at least an interesting development. What's the difference between a video and a movie? What separates reality from artifice? As it happens, the festival's first offering, Trent Harris's ''Beaver Trilogy'' (showing tonight and tomorrow) is a work that raises these questions, and a number of others, including,  ''What in the world was that?''</p>
        <p>Whatever else it is, ''Beaver Trilogy'' is a rivetingly strange, multilayered inquiry into celebrity, obsession and serendipity. It begins in 1980, with a parking lot encounter between Mr. Harris and Larry Huff, a voluble young man whose consuming ambition is to be ''on the tube, the set, television.'' He introduces himself as an impressionist -- ''the Rich Little of Beaver,'' the small Utah town that gives the film its name -- but his enthusiasm seems to exceed his talent. Though Mr. Huff does a little John Wayne and an almost passable Sylvester Stallone, his real passion is for Olivia Newton-John, whom he impersonates, resplendent in blond chicken-wing wig, at a local talent show he organizes for Mr. Harris's benefit.</p>
        <p>By itself, ''The Beaver Kid,'' which ends with Mr. Huff's heartfelt performance of Barry Manilow's ''New York State of Mind'' (an encore after his signature piece, the Newton-John ballad ''Please Don't Keep Me Waiting''), would be an appealing curiosity, a window into a half-forgotten moment in American popular culture and a premonition of the current obsession with gender-bending performance. But Mr. Harris followed his initial cinema verite oddity with two remakes, the first starring an as-yet unknown Sean Penn, the second featuring the madcap emoting of Crispin Glover.</p>
        <p>Each installment makes explicit some of the buried themes of the original -- the exploitative relationship between filmmaker and subject, the thin line between glory and humiliation, and the tension between conformity and self-expression in small-town America.</p>
        <p>The second part is an almost verbatim re-enactment of the first. The third, ''The Orkly Kid'' -- edited like a made-for-television movie and boasting a full battery of credits -- makes Mr. Huff's story into a tongue-in-cheek morality play about daring to be different and following your dreams, however ridiculous. But not even Mr. Glover's uninhibited performance can match the uncanny sincerity of the real-life Mr. Huff, who comes from somewhere beyond any filmmaker's imagination.</p>
        <p>What place is that? ''The Beaver Trilogy'' makes several references to ''Real People,'' a long-forgotten forerunner of the current flood of reality programming. And scattered through the festival's diverse thematic programs are a number of arresting, horrifying and sometimes boring real people, including some of the artists themselves, presented amid the background noise and surface clutter of their very real lives.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow afternoon and then again on Monday evening you can take an invigorating tour through several states of misery and squalor in ''All Too Human,'' described as ''Three Chronicles of Abject Lives.'' These videos are queasily fascinating and morally troubling. Richard Billingham, known for his unflattering photographs of his working-class parents in northern England, brings us into their midst in ''Fishtank,'' which observes his father's drunkenness and his mother's needy melancholy, as well as their pet goldfish.</p>
        <p>In ''Loss Prevention'' Jeanne C. Finley narrates her elderly mother's arrest for shoplifting and reflects on her own unhappy childhood as the daughter of a kleptomaniac. The program's capper, ''If Only I,'' consists of Donigan Cumming's grueling, captivating interviews with a woman named Colleen, whose biography moves from childhood sexual abuse to alcoholism, institutionalization and a failed suicide attempt.</p>
        <p>''If Only I'' is the emotional equivalent of a snuff film. It's clearly meant to disturb, but it crosses an ethical line that other pieces, including ''The Beaver Trilogy,'' attempt both to demarcate and to skirt. The video not only records Colleen's abjection but also participates in it. That she may be too far gone to care or to protect herself hardly excuses the invasion of her privacy.</p>
        <p>Of course, in the age of celebrity -- the age of ''Survivor,'' cyberspying, and eager auto-surveillance -- the concept of privacy may be obsolete. In any case, not all the violations of it recorded at the festival are so grim, so emotionally charged, or so morally questionable. Which brings me to George Kuchar, an experimental Super 8 maven of the 1960's (''Hold Me While I'm Naked,'' ''Corruption of the Damned'') turned indefatigable video diarist.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow night's program includes a selection of recent work from Mr. Kuchar's extensive catalog -- visits to friends and neighbors, travels here and there, all featuring his walrus-mustached visage and his variously solicitous and sarcastic commentary. This program, at which Mr. Kuchar will appear in person, is an antipasto for the feast of episodic eccentricity that is ''Secrets of the Shadow World,'' a two-hour ''mini-series'' about U.F.O. conspiracy theories and a whole lot of other things, which will be presented on Sunday and Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Imagine a long episode of ''The X-Files'' shot with the cheesy, prefab special effects of a prepackaged wedding video and accompanied by generic movie-score bombast. Now add a cast of garrulous oddballs in costume-shop robes and makeup, arts administrators, avant-garde filmmakers and a very indulgent cat. But really you can't imagine what ''Secrets of the Shadow World'' is like, any more than you can imagine a day in the life of a tirelessly inventive, endlessly curious artist with a video camera, or a day in your own life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuchar's artistry is not immediately apparent. Watching his jerky, spontaneous recordings of life's pleasant inanity, you may say, ''Hey, I could do that.'' Which is part of the point. What's stopping you?</p>
        <p>If the video camera seems uniquely adept at registering living human presences, in all their uncomfortable specificity, it also offers a special access to the human interior, a vehicle for fantasy, speculation and dreaming, exemplified in a program called ''Electronic Unconscious,'' which will be shown on Monday and Tuesday. Compared to Mr. Harris's and Mr. Kuchar's works, the films in this program seem somewhat arch and self-conscious. The most interesting of them is Chris Petit's ''Asylum,'' an hourlong ''sci-fi narrative collage'' which is a bit like a condensed, British version of ''Secrets of the Shadow World'' without Mr. Kuchar's genially anarchic presence.</p>
        <p>And though video art has at times in its short history been dominated by abstraction, by an aesthetic of the image, this year's festival, like the reality programming that is both its cultural context and its cultural antithesis, is dominated by images of people. If video is a way of exploring often uncomfortable personal connections -- between videomakers and their subjects, parents and their children, young men and their alter egos -- it can also explore loneliness, disconnection and loss.</p>
        <p>Tonight and Sunday, a half-dozen brief studies in alienation will be screened in a program called ''Only Disconnect,'' the best of which is a collage of disjointed, abstract narratives called ''Nest of Tens,'' by Miranda July.</p>
        <p>One of the most moving evocations of the irreplaceable quiddity of a person is Elisabeth Subrin's ''Fancy,'' which will be shown in the program ''Brought to Light'' tomorrow and Sunday. The video is devoted to the life and work of a photographer, Francesca Woodman, who committed suicide in 1981 at the age of 22. Her work, which consisted almost entirely of nude self-portraits, never appears on screen. Instead we see her possessions, laid out like auction lots, and hear descriptions of her pictures as fully clothed stand-ins re-enact her poses. Somehow, Ms. Subrin confers immortality on her subject while at the same time making vivid her irrevocable absence.</p>
        <p>The commemorative power of video is related to its alchemical capacity to confer renown. The confessional impulse and the urge to perform are not entirely separable, as the examples of Larry Huff and George Kuchar suggest. Mr. Huff dreamed of making the big time in his blond wig and leather boots just before the advent of MTV, which has, in the decades since, come to dominate and to transform the culture of videomaking.</p>
        <p>On Monday night, the New York Press film critic Armond White, a mainstay of the festival since 1993, will present a selection of music videos, including work by the directors Mark Romanek and Hype Williams, and musicians like Bjork, Mos Def, and Macy Gray. Like the more rarefied (and rarely seen) work that dominates the festival, music video, according to Mr. White, ''gives a chance for filmmakers not connected with the Hollywood mainstream to express themselves.''</p>
        <p>''Even though music videos are commercial,'' Mr. White said in a telephone interview, ''they are also experimental. They set the tone for visual language, and they do what no other videomakers can do: they reach a public.''</p>
        <p>Mr. White's cherished pop-music videos, with their fast editing and smoothly polished surfaces, stand in obvious contrast to the rough, knotty work of artists like Mr. Kuchar and Mr. Harris. The abundant and various material on display at this year's festival is evidence of the medium's almost infinite variety and elasticity, its ability to comprehend, in small increments and at great length, in real time and on landscapes of fantasy, the breadth and scope of contemporary life.</p>
        <p>On the Big Screen</p>
        <p>The New York Video Festival, part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000, runs through Thursday at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center.
