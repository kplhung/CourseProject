        <p>Expanding their legal attack on the exchange of copyrighted works on the Internet, the motion picture and music industries today sued to shut down Scour.com, a venture the industries say permits the free trading not just of music but of movies, in some cases as soon as they open in theaters.</p>

        <p>Expanding their legal attack on the exchange of copyrighted works on the Internet, the motion picture and music industries today sued to shut down Scour.com, a venture the industries say permits the free trading not just of music but of movies, in some cases as soon as they open in theaters.</p>
        <p>In invoking the film issue, the lawsuit adds a wrinkle to a story that has focused largely on music, in particular on the embattled Napster service. It also puts the motion picture industry at odds with one of its own stalwarts, given that Michael Ovitz, the former Disney president and an agent who represents some of Hollywood's biggest stars, owns 20 percent of Scour.</p>
        <p>In their lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, more than 30 of the world's largest movie and record houses contend that their copyrighted works are being freely exchanged by tens of thousands of users of Scour.com, which is based in Los Angeles. Started by several UCLA students, the site points users to multimedia content on the Internet, including music and video, serving in part like a focused search engine.</p>
        <p>But the site also includes a feature called Scour Exchange, which allows users to trade music and movie files they keep on their computers. In that way, the feature is like Napster, which has been sued by the recording industry for permitting users to exchange music files.</p>
        <p>Scour issued a statement expressing surprise at the lawsuit. It said that it had been negotiating business agreements with the record companies, and that it already had deals to present content on its site from two plaintiffs in the case, Miramax and Hollywood Records.</p>
        <p>The statement did not address the legal questions raised by the suit. But in interviews earlier this year, company officials said they should not be held accountable if some people use the service to trade copyrighted material, an assertion also made by Napster.</p>
        <p>Industry officials countered that the company was knowingly permitting, even encouraging, the exchange of copyrighted materials, and seeking to profit from it.</p>
        <p>''This lawsuit is about stealing,'' said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America. ''It's a harsh word, but it's the only one that fits the definition.''</p>
        <p>More generally, the lawsuit underscores unresolved copyright-infringement issues raised by the advent and growing popularity of the Internet, which provides an unprecedented ability to trade and copy data. The issue could face a crucial test next week when a federal judge in San Francisco is scheduled to consider whether to grant the Recording Industry Association of America's request for a preliminary injunction to shut down Napster.</p>
        <p>The Scour lawsuit does not say how many copyrighted works are available on Scour Exchange, but says there are 1.8 million files available through Scour, ''most of them unauthorized and infringing copies.'' Industry officials said it was typical for 25,000 people to be using the service at any given time. And documents filed with the court said that some of the works traded freely were popular music and first-run movies like ''Gladiator'' and ''Mission: Impossible 2.''</p>
        <p>One additional twist in the case comes from the presence of Mr. Ovitz, who read about Scour in a campus newspaper at the University of California at Los Angeles and bought a stake in the company last year. Some industry analysts have said that Mr. Ovitz's stake in Scour is a conflict of interest because his talent management agency, Artists Management Group, represents some of the very artists whose works are traded on Scour Exchange.</p>
        <p>In May, Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of America, wrote a letter to Mr. Ovitz contending that Scour was engaged in unlawful activities.</p>
        <p>A person close to Artists Management Group said Mr. Ovitz had grown increasingly uncomfortable with his association with the company. In June, Mr. Ovitz sent letters to Dan Rodrigues, the president of Scour Exchange, and to the Scour board expressing concern about the copyright implications.</p>
        <p>The person also said that Mr. Ovitz felt he was not in a position to control the company's direction, and that Mr. Ovitz had hired an investment banker to sell his stake. Officials from Scour declined to comment on Mr. Ovitz's position. A spokesman for Artists Management also declined to comment.</p>
        <p>The position stands in contrast to statements made earlier by officials from Artists Management Group. In May, James Ellis, the agency's general counsel, said the company stood behind Scour Exchange and the concept of file sharing. ''In the face of a rapidly changing marketplace, Scour had to respond to maintain and grow its audience and give them what they wanted,'' Mr. Ellis said.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit against Scour does not specify the amount of damages sought.</p>
