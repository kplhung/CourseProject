        <p>The highlights of the summer in New Jersey are retrospectives of artists who happened to be in or around New York more or less in the 1960's. They had nothing whatsoever to do with one another. The New York art world is really different coexisting but independent worlds, as these exhibitions remind us.</p>
        <p>Art Museum, Princeton University</p>
        <p>Yayoi Kusama arrived in the United States in late 1957 for a show of her drawings at a gallery in Seattle. She stayed six months, moved to New York, canceled her return ticket to Japan and spent the next 14 years, having overcome various obstacles at the front edge of American art. Those obstacles, apart from being a woman, included the restrictive culture of postwar Japan, in which she matured and outside of which she had to establish an identity; her parents' opposition to her becoming an artist; and her mental instability.</p>
        <p>After resettling in Japan in the mid-70's, drifting into obscurity and becoming a resident of the Seiwa Hospital for the Mentally Ill in Toyko, where she still lives, she has in recent years been included in exhibitions that have revived interest in her career. This latest show, a gem, focuses on the drawings she did before coming to America.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kusama was born in 1929 to an affluent family in the mountains of Nagano Prefecture in central Japan. She heard voices and saw visions from childhood. She saw halos around objects, thought flowers talked to one another and hallucinated net and dot patterns. ''One day looking at a red-flower-patterned tablecloth on the table,'' she recalled in the early 60's about an incident when she was a girl, ''I turned my eyes to the ceiling and saw the same red-flower pattern everywhere.'' She came to understand endlessly proliferating patterns as an expression of an underlying order to the universe, and she began to draw shapes that resembled cells, molecules, planets, stars and nets.</p>
        <p>Sometimes she worked 50 to 60 hours at a stretch, turning out as many as 50 drawings a day. ''I gradually feel myself under the spell of the accumulation and repetition,'' she said.</p>
        <p>One thinks of Joseph Beuys, a few years older than Ms. Kusama, emerging from the Axis side of the war and beginning his career by making thousands of eccentric drawings, an obsessiveness that suggested expiation as much as creation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kusama brought 2,000 of her works on paper to the United States. Some ended up in the collection of Richard Castellane, a New York dealer who gave her three shows in the mid-60's that established her reputation as a provocateur working at the intersection of Pop, Minimalism and Surrealism. Sex became her idee fixe. Nude happenings and walk-in environments (mirrored, with thousands of pink polka-dotted stuffed fabric phalluses in them, for example) made her notorious at the same time that they ensured her place in a generation that included Lucas Samaras, Claes Oldenburg, Allan Kaprow, Carolee Schneeman, Lee Bontecou and Jim Dine.</p>
        <p>These later works also overshadowed her earlier net drawings and paintings, on which the performances and installations were based. More concise and less melodramatic, they were also about compulsiveness, psychedelic color, illusions of space and cosmic, psychosexual symbolism.</p>
        <p>This show, from Mr. Castellane's collections, includes several dozen early works on paper, most of them 12 by 14 inches, intricate, luminous and fresh. In their repetitive patterning they have been related to traditional women's work, like sewing and knitting, and to techniques of Asian landscape painting, but their links are also with American art of the time: Minimalist repetition and Pop color elegantly combined so that febrile form balances delicacy with hallucinatory effect.</p>
        <p>Their modesty is a strength. ''I am always standing in the middle of the obsession against the passionate accumulation and repetition inside of me and am lost,'' she said. ''As to why I have to paint these silly nets, I do not understand myself this strange action. Probably simply because there is time there.''</p>
        <p>The results are intense, brilliantly colored poems about the mystery of the universe.</p>
        <p>Newark Museum</p>
        <p>Wang Fangyu exemplified the Chinese scholar-artist in its modern American manifestation. As scholar-artists used to escape the intrigues of the Chinese court by going into the countryside to paint, Wang seems to have escaped academe, a court culture of its own, by retreating into his studio.</p>
        <p>A professor at Yale and Seton Hall Universities and a calligrapher, Wang (1913-1997) was born in Beijing and moved to the United States in the 1940's. Art, as he explained in a videotape that is part of this show, was more than just the objects he painted. It was a physical state, successful calligraphy depending on a combination of mental harmony and an athlete's dedication to training.</p>
        <p>On the same tape young students in San Francisco are seen learning the rudiments of calligraphy according to these principles: relaxed wrist, suspended elbow, proper posture, meditation at the start of each class.</p>
        <p>The show includes Wang's brushes, ink stones and seals, a nice didactic touch for a tribute to a painter who was a lifelong teacher. In his later years he completed a series of scrolls on the theme of the dragon, which in Chinese symbolizes spring, creativity and change. The style is bold, lively, athletic, with isolated characters against white space, bringing to a Westerner's mind the Abstract Expressionists and their various descendants who borrowed from Asian art. The result is an implicit two-culture dialogue, reflecting Wang's situation.</p>
        <p>Newark has another display worth a glance. The museum's departments of American and decorative arts have filled niches in a hallway with boxes from their collections: a Joseph Cornell box, a mirrored box by Lucas Samaras with tacks and colored yarn inside, and a box by Betye Saar that assembles feathers, flowers, a white glove, a silver spoon and old photographs. There are also practical boxes: a 19th-century Russian cigar box encrusted with military decorations and a late 18th-century inlaid English tea box. But these are no less artful than the art boxes. They are all worlds to themselves.</p>
        <p>Montclair Art Museum</p>
        <p>The retrospective of the American painter Will Barnet, which fills most of this museum, is complemented by a show from its collection of work by painters whom Mr. Barnet has known or whose art relates to his. His evolution so nearly encapsulates changes during the middle decades of the 20th century that the retrospective is virtually an overview of American art then.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barnet, who was born in 1911, started by painting urban scenes. His heroes included Daumier and the Mexican muralist Orozco. Reginald Marsh backed his admission at the Art Students League, where he studied with Stuart Davis. His works from the 30's related to Marsh, early Rothko, Ben Shahn and Joseph Solman, among others.</p>
        <p>He turned toward abstraction. He mimicked Picasso, Klee and Miro for a while. He became part of a group of American artists (his friends Steve Wheeler and Peter Busa were others in the group) fascinated by American Indian and particularly by Hopi and Northwest Coast Indian art with its all-over patterning and earthen colors. The art seemed to them to dovetail with aspects of Klee and Picasso and with Miro's Surrealism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barnet's paintings from the 40's and early 50's became flat, Cubist-inflected, sometimes self-consciously childlike and highly geometric. They could resemble mosaics or jigsaw puzzles. The flatness and palette harked back to Davis with an added Byzantine formality. Iconic structure implied spiritual order, one of Mr. Barnet's distinguishing traits.</p>
        <p>Abstract Expressionism, which was going in another direction and attracting the most attention at that time, was partly what he was reacting against. Then he moved toward another brand of abstraction: bigger shapes floating in luminous fields, the style related to the works of artists like Myron Stout and Leon Polk Smith, and to older Americans like Arthur Dove and Marsden Hartley. All this was happening while Mr. Barnet was reconsidering figuration, too. In the 1950's he worked simultaneously in different modes, reflecting by himself an eclectic American scene.</p>
        <p>The pictures for which he is best known today are probably the portraits and figure studies he began to do by the mid-50's. They are simplified silhouettes against large planes of color, silent and calm. Alex Katz can come to mind.</p>
        <p>There is an obvious historical source: portraiture, both Italian and early American. A self-portrait from 1967 emulates Bronzino, as does a portrait of the collector Roy Neuberger (1965). ''Croquet'' (1985) illustrates the early American connection, stiff, funny, reductivist and differently austere. Sentimentality, occasionally a problem in Mr. Barnet's art, is absent from ''Croquet'' and the self-portrait, which is part of their strength.</p>
        <p>The exhibition, organized by Gail Stavitsky, demonstrates the connections among Mr. Barnet's styles. Abstractions like ''Janus and the White Vertebra'' (1955), sometimes praised at the expense of figurative works like the portrait of Ruth Bowman (1967) or the excellent ''Woman Reading'' (1965), are the outcome of the early figurative work and precedents for the later art. Mr. Barnet's good work, it turns out, comes throughout a career of persistent curiosity and eccentric coherence.</p>
