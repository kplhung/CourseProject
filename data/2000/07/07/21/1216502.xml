        <p>Concentrating on four states that political strategists say could tip the electoral balance this fall, the Bush campaign yesterday began running its first major television commercials of the general election, a kind of sunny prologue to the Republican convention that begins in 10 days.</p>

        <p>Concentrating on four states that political strategists say could tip the electoral balance this fall, the Bush campaign yesterday began running its first major television commercials of the general election, a kind of sunny prologue to the Republican convention that begins in 10 days.</p>
        <p>The three commercials, produced by the campaign's own advertising agency, Maverick Media, went on the air in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and Washington State in what Ari Fleischer, a campaign spokesman, described as a ''multimillion-dollar ad buy.'' Bush officials would not say how long the commercials would run, or whether more states might be added.</p>
        <p>But the choice of television markets was an instant subject for dissection by Gore campaign officials, who pointed to the inclusion of Florida as a sign that some crucial states which might normally be safely in the Republican column were viewed by the Bush campaign as in need of some media triage. Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, being the brother of the presumptive nominee, gave them additional fodder.</p>
        <p>''I think that documents the fact that Florida is really in play,'' said Chris Lehane, the Gore campaign press secretary. ''Right now, it's a virtual dead heat.''</p>
        <p>Though Florida's 25 electoral votes went for the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1996, over the past three decades the state voted more typically for Republican presidential candidates. Republicans hold the majority in the state's Congressional delegation, and Florida is the first former Confederate state to have a legislature under Republican control.</p>
        <p>Tony Welch, a spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party, said newspapers in the state had put the television advertising investment by the Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee at about $1 million. ''You don't spend a million dollars in a safe state,'' Mr. Welch said.</p>
        <p>Aides to Vice President Al Gore would not say whether the campaign would respond rapidly with commercials of its own. Up to now, spots featuring the presumptive nominees have been run exclusively by the Democratic and Republican national committees; the Democrats alone are expected to have spent about $25 million by the time they open their convention in Los Angeles next month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer said that the 30-second spots were designed to reinforce presidential qualities of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. ''The theme running through the ads is leadership. Now is the time in American history we can exercise bold leadership willing to unite America.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the commercials concede a point that Mr. Gore has made a cornerstone of his campaign this summer, that the country is enjoying an unparalleled era of prosperity. The Bush campaign argues in the advertisements that the national economic upswing should be the foundation for a shift to Republican leadership committed to solving complicated problems like how to shore up Social Security and raise standards in schools.</p>
        <p>In one spot, titled ''Hard Things,'' Mr. Bush looks into the camera and says, ''This is a moment in history when we have a chance to focus on tough problems. It's not always popular to say, 'Our children can't read, or Social Security needs improving, or we have a budget surplus and a deficit of values.' But those are the right things to say.''</p>
        <p>Another characterizes the election as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity ''to do something good with it all.'' Echoing the declared themes of the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, it asks, ''Shouldn't the president unite, not divide, and renew America's purpose?''</p>
        <p>The warmest and fuzziest of the spots features close-ups of a newborn's foot and a montage of ordinary people in what the commercial makers call ''found'' moments. Over footage shot this month in the New York area, a narrator declares, ''a lot of new Americans arrived today. They were neither Republican nor Democrat. But someone held them close and hoped. Be healthy. Learn a lot. It takes leadership to give everyone a shot at the American dream.''</p>
        <p>While political spots are sometimes tested with focus groups before being put on the air, these were not, said a Bush adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity. But in market surveys of voters, the adviser said, ''consistently, for some reason, Bush scores overwhelmingly higher than Gore on the question of strong leadership.''</p>
        <p>Greg Stevens, who made the commercials for Senator John McCain of Arizona during the primaries, said the Bush campaign's selection of states for the media buy was ''probably smart,'' in that ''if they can block him in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington, Gore can't win.''</p>
