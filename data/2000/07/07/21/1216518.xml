        <p>Ex-Manager Suing Over Singer's Deal</p>
        <p>CHRISTINA AGUILERA'S former manager is suing Ms. Aguilera's mother and Ms. Aguilera's current manager. The former manager, RUTH G. INNISS, is seeking $7 million because she says that her verbal agreement to guide Ms. Aguilera's career has been broken. In the lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Ms. Inniss lays claim to discovering the teenage idol when she was a pre-teenager. Ms. Inniss said that she recognized Ms. Aguilera's talent in 1993, when Ms. Aguilera was a 12-year-old Mouseketeer.</p>

        <p>Ex-Manager Suing Over Singer's Deal</p>
        <p>CHRISTINA AGUILERA'S former manager is suing Ms. Aguilera's mother and Ms. Aguilera's current manager. The former manager, RUTH G. INNISS, is seeking $7 million because she says that her verbal agreement to guide Ms. Aguilera's career has been broken. In the lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Ms. Inniss lays claim to discovering the teenage idol when she was a pre-teenager. Ms. Inniss said that she recognized Ms. Aguilera's talent in 1993, when Ms. Aguilera was a 12-year-old Mouseketeer.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit alleges that Ms. Aguilera's mother, SHELLEY KEARNS, agreed to let Ms. Inniss nurture her daughter's talent and even called Ms. Inniss for help when Ms. Aguilera's contract with the Walt Disney Company lapsed. It says Ms. Inniss met with a music lawyer, NORMAND R. KURTZ, and the two agreed to represent Ms. Aguilera. Ms. Inniss is seeking $2 million from Ms. Kearns and $5 million from Mr. Kurtz. Neither returned calls for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Virginia Official Is Leaving a Race</p>
        <p>EMILY COURIC, a state senator in Virginia and the older sister of KATIE COURIC of NBC's ''Today,'' said yesterday that she had pancreatic cancer and would not run for lieutenant governor next year. Emily Couric, 53, said that she received the diagnosis on Wednesday, according to The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>''My doctors, family and I are now working on designing the best course of treatment to address this cancer,'' she told reporters, according to the A.P. ''Many, many people have pledged their support to my candidacy for lieutenant governor and have actually begun the hard work of a long campaign. It would not be fair to let them continue when I cannot give such a campaign the time and energy it deserves.''</p>
        <p>Emily Couric, who was elected to her second term last year, said she would continue in the General Assembly. Her sister has been campaigning to raise awareness about colon cancer since the death of her husband, JAY MONAHAN, in 1998.</p>
        <p>Lawyers to Stage Imaginary Case</p>
        <p>Two lawyers who defended Katherine Ann Power, a Vietnam-era radical who surrendered in 1993 after 23 years as a fugitive, for her role in a bank robbery that ended with the death of a Boston police officer, are joining forces again this week.</p>
        <p>But this time the case is imaginary, the defendant is George Washington and the trial is to be staged at a bar association convention in London.</p>
        <p>The lawyers who represented Ms. Powers in connection with a bank robbery that ended with the death of a Boston police officer were RIKKI KLIEMAN, now an anchor on the Court TV cable channel, and JAMES DOYLE.  The facts of the case were that Washington had been lured to Canada and was arrested for treason.</p>
        <p>''Our defense is a combination of jury nullification and appealing to a British jury about what an Englishman should be,'' said Ms. Klieman (who met her husband, WILLIAM J. BRATTON, during the Power case; he was the police commissioner in Boston when Ms. Power surrendered). ''George was a very good Englishman. He embodied all of the highest values of being an Englishman. He is not a proud, overbearing ambitious country squire, he really is an Englishman, and we're going to have that jury understand what the rights of Englishmen are all about. It wasn't George's fault that the British government didn't follow the colonists' wishes.''</p>
        <p>A moment later, she added, ''We may go down in flames, but we are going down in flames with style.''</p>
