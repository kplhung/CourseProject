        <p>It wasn't quite mutiny, as much as it was an example of American democracy. Collectively, delicately, John McEnroe's players let it be known that they preferred him on the sideline, where a Davis Cup captain belongs.</p>
        <p>McEnroe took that attitudinal proclamation from a team meeting Wednesday night and today officially junked his tentative plan to play doubles Saturday, as a 41-year-old antique whose last Davis Cup competition was in 1992. Minutes before this afternoon's draw, he removed himself from the four-man United States roster that will begin play Friday as a heavy underdog to Spain in the Davis Cup semifinal.</p>
        <p>An unsightly blister in the middle of his left hand and some soreness in his left arm from three days of practice hadn't persuaded McEnroe to lay down his racket. The tenor of the team meeting, however, made it clear to him that his players, undecorated as they might be, thought it was unfair for McEnroe to nominate himself, given the clay-court surface that was very likely to expose both his fitness and his age.</p>
        <p>''The fact is that John is not head and shoulders above any of us in his caliber as a doubles player right now,'' said Todd Martin, the senior American player and de facto diplomat. ''His knowledge of the game is better, and to have him on the sidelines, telling us what we're doing right and wrong, I think will help the doubles team quite a bit.''</p>
        <p>Martin, designated as the No. 1 singles player, will play Albert Costa in Friday's first singles match, before Jan-Michael Gambill meets Alex Corretja. It was after Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi withdrew their commitment to play the semifinal that McEnroe named himself to the team. Today, he said, it was in large part a strategic maneuver in the event Agassi changed his mind, which McEnroe had heard was a possibility.</p>
        <p>Yet, since he assumed the captain's job last summer, the idea of playing doubles had been bouncing softly around McEnroe's head like one of his legendary touch volleys. When he didn't name an active doubles player to this team last week, he seemed to be setting the stage for himself, though he admittedly said he was not playing well on the practice court.</p>
        <p>''You know me -- I wanted to play, but these guys talked me out of it,'' McEnroe said. ''They wanted a chance at glory, so now they have to step up and show them.''</p>
        <p>''They'' -- Chris Woodruff and Vince Spadea -- are ranked No. 188 and 864, respectively, in doubles. The Spaniards don't have accomplished doubles players either, and their team of Corretja and Juan Balcells is in itself little more than a marriage of necessity. Doubles, McEnroe said, is the one match here this weekend that he has been counting on winning, no matter who played.</p>
        <p>The decision, then, was less about results and form than it was about whose team this was, in the absence of the American stars. Players such as Woodruff and Spadea understand they are not and never will be what McEnroe was, but they argued that they are active professionals, in the prime of their careers and they, unlike Sampras and Agassi, made the effort to return to Europe after the clay and grass-court seasons.</p>
        <p>''I mean, everybody in the world knows that he's the best doubles player of all time,'' Gambill said of McEnroe. ''That goes without saying. But it's not like because he's not out there, we can't win. We pretty much discussed it. It wasn't really like we said, 'John, you can't play.' ''</p>
        <p>According to McEnroe, it was more what wasn't said: something along the lines of ''John, please play.''</p>
        <p>Only Gambill expressed enthusiasm at any point during the week over the possibility of playing doubles with him, McEnroe said. Martin and even Woodruff made it plain that while McEnroe's second serve may be good enough for seniors events, the Spaniards were likely to treat it as if it were batting practice.</p>
        <p>Asked if he had considered playing despite his players' sentiments, McEnroe said: ''I'd feel a little awkward. Maybe I've gotten a little soft in my old age. So far I've led democratically. I haven't led dictatorially.'' He admitted that ''the focus had gotten off track,'' and that he was uncomfortable with the notion that he was ''riding in on a horse to save the Davis Cup.''</p>
        <p>The bottom line is that the doubles will be moot unless the Americans can avoid being ground down by Corretja and Costa in singles. The Spanish captain, Javier Duarte, raised some eyebrows by choosing Costa as his second singles player instead of Juan Carlos Ferrero, one of the hottest young clay-court players in the world. Ferrero is ranked 13th. Costa is 16th. Corretja is ranked seventh. Martin is ranked 29th, while Gambill is 37th.</p>
        <p>''On paper, they should win,'' McEnroe said. ''But Spain has been underachieving for 20 years in Davis Cup. I've just been surprised that they haven't been able to get over the hump and have choked so many times.''</p>
        <p>That said, McEnroe picked up and was off to Bilbao, an hour's drive, to hit the Guggenheim Museum. He didn't have to practice. There are benefits to being 41, and done.</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>TODD MARTIN has a 13-2 record on clay-court surfaces against Spanish players and a 31-5 record over all. . . . JOHN McENROE said he has not received a call or a fax from PETE SAMPRAS or ANDRE AGASSI wishing the team luck. ''Let me know if you hear from them,'' he said.</p>
