        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* ANNI ALBERS, Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Aug. 20). This survey of arguably the most influential textile artist of the 20th century is part retrospective, part weaving seminar, part biography -- and altogether fascinating. It traces the development of Albers's work from her student days at the Bauhaus to Black Mountain College, where she taught with her husband, Josef. It contrasts her designs for commercial fabrics, which emphasized structure and materials in new ways, with her pictorially striking handloomed pieces. A gallery of photographs, letters, personal memorabilia and pre-Columbian textile fragments she collected reflects her character and quietly glamorous personal style. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Tuesdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50, students and senior citizens; free for children under 12 (Roberta Smith).</p>

        <p>* ANNI ALBERS, Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Aug. 20).

        <p>''AMERICAN MODERN, 1925-1940: DESIGN FOR A NEW AGE'' (through Jan. 7) and ''A CENTURY OF DESIGN, PART II: 1925-1950'' (through Oct. 29), Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 81st Street, (212) 535-7710. ''American Modern,'' the larger and more interesting of these two shows, deals with the period between two design extravaganzas, the Exposition des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes'' in Paris in 1925 and the New York World's Fair of 1939-40. Drawn from the Met's own collection and that of a patron, John C. Waddell, the show presents furniture, appliances, clocks, radios, cameras, textiles, tableware, posters and parts of a snappy blue-and-chrome dining room, along with other work by Bel Geddes, Deskey, Dreyfuss, Frankl, Loewy, Noguchi, Teague and Wright. The range is from French Art Deco, whose hallmark was luxury and chic, through Bauhaus geometric austerity, to the machine-influenced, streamlined mode developed by American industrial designers. ''A Century of Design,'' Part II of a four-part survey focusing on European 20th-century modes, also draws from the Met's collection. Although studded with star names, like Aalto, Breuer, Eames, Ruhlmann and Mies, the show is lackluster by contrast. There is no scarcity of famous chairs, and other good things include a wonderful scale drawing for the Daimler-Benz sport convertible No. 3384 (circa 1933). But there are more than a few non-treasures, like Miro's 1942 earthenware vase, whose raison d'etre is hard to figure. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and the elderly (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>''BEADS, BODY AND SOUL: ART AND LIGHT IN THE YORUBA UNIVERSE,'' Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Aug. 27); Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500 (through Sept. 17) The Yoruba beading tradition and the religious faith it reflects is the subject of this opulent, edifying two-museum exhibition. Downtown, where the material is mostly African, an array of beaded ritual objects, sculptures, royal regalia and personal shrines illuminate both the indigenous tradition and its expansion by the arrival of brightly colored beads from Europe. At the Harlem museum, the exhibition follows this tradition to the Americas, where it thrives among Afro-Cuban, Afro-Brazilian and African-American devotees of Santeria and Candomble. It is a story of inspiring persistence and fascinating permutation, told by one of the most entrancing, universally beloved artistic materials (Smith).</p>
        <p>''THE BIRTH OF BAROQUE: CARRACCI AT THE METROPOLITAN,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 17). If the family known as Carracci -- Annibale (1560-1609), his brother Agostino (1557-1602) and their cousin Ludovico (1555-1619) -- didn't exactly invent the dynamic art known as Baroque, they gave their all to it. Ludovico developed an important academy that sought to correct what he considered the distortions of the prevailing Mannerist style by returning to natural forms and the heritage of the great Italian masters like Correggio, Veronese and Titian. Annibale, considered one of the greatest draftsmen of the age, was helped by Agostino in his creation of a highly influential fresco cycle for the ceiling of the Farnese Palace in Rome that brought back the Renaissance love of human drama and emotion. This small but illustrious show of paintings, drawings and prints from the Metropolitan's own collection of Carracci works offers paintings like Ludovico's innovative ''Lamentation'' (1582), a shockingly realistic Pieta scene, and Annibale's ''Coronation of the Virgin'' (about 1596), a symmetrical composition showing the Virgin crowned Queen of Heaven by Jesus and God the Father that reflects the classicism of Annibale's Roman style. But the Carracci powers of observation and ability to handle complicated narratives is best seen in their drawings and prints, which range from Annibale's charmingly intimate ink with wash, ''A Domestic Scene'' (probably early 1580's), in which a mother warms her child's nightgown before a fire, to Ludovico's ambitious ''Last Communion of St. Jerome (no date), a tightly composed altarpiece proposal. Hours: see above. (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* CHARDIN, Metropolitan Museum (through Sept. 3). This retrospective doesn't tell us much that wasn't already known about Jean-Simeon Chardin, but there's nothing wrong with being reminded occasionally of what great painting is. The art, by contrast with so much Rococo art, is about love, not sex. Quiet and deliberation were Chardin's essential ingredients, combined with a perfect mastery of abstract form. He was the best still-life painter ever because he made the most of the least, his work focusing on the same humble cups and pans in one painting after another, one decade after another. The result was a compilation of precise little observations that together make as true a record of the value of seeing as exists in the history of art. Hours and admission: See above (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* WILLIAM MERRITT CHASE, ''Modern American Landscapes, 1886-1890,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Aug. 13). Chase (1849-1916) had a long, distinguished run as a painter, teacher and art politician. But this show zeroes in on the five-year period when, in a transitional phase between the brown, murky tones of his Munich training and his arrival at a lighter style based on French Impressionism, he painted genteel views of park landscapes in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Aside from their engaging scenic content, the 35 oils and pastels in the show are important because they are the first paintings in which an Impressionist style was used to depict American subjects. Recent examination corrected some errors about their locales. And new scholarly speculation on Chase's motives for painting them suggest that he wanted them to serve as examples of ''civilized urban landscapes'' that accorded with the European avant-garde model of modern life. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''STUART DAVIS IN GLOUCESTER,'' National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through July 30). The quaint fishing port of Gloucester, Mass., seemed an unlikely hangout for the jazzy city painter Davis (1894-1964). But he actually loved the place, and in the summers he spent there, from 1915 to 1934, he used motifs drawn from the rocky coast, the townscape and the maritime activity as he worked toward a more progressive style of painting. This show, with some 45 oils, watercolors and drawings, gives a good account of his struggles in assimilating Modernist ideas to arrive at the innovative American Cubist style for which he is celebrated. But Davis's art had more to do with his own genius: his gift for paring line and shape to essences and uniting them with scintillating color. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $4.50, children 6 to 16, students and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''GLASS WORKS: EMERGING ARTISTS,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art (through Sept. 3). Thirteen Brooklyn artists were each invited to produce a glass artwork in response to a piece from the permanent collection. Their creations are distributed throughout the museum, each presented near the work that inspired it. Highlights include Robert Panepinto's heavy blown-glass vase with the image of an Indian deity traced inside; a thick, frosted tortoise shell shield by Himiko Ohta; Beth Lipman's three-dimensional copy of a complicated 19th-century American still life painting; and Jeff Zimmerman's mirrored, suspended bulbous form, a deliberately contrary response to Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait's sentimental painting of a girl and a fawn. Hours and admission: See above (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>''IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF GOETHE,'' Paintings and Drawings From German Collections, Dahesh Museum, 601 Fifth Avenue, at 48th Street, (212) 759-0606 (through Aug. 19). During the golden age (1829-1865) of the influential Dusseldorf Academy of Art, German artists flocked to Rome, where the Academy maintained an informal outpost. What these northern artists loved about the Eternal City were the picturesque ruins, the beautiful vistas in the campagnas, the architecture of buildings and monuments, gardens, woods, walls, hill towns and, above all, the profusion of light that bathed everything in a golden glow. More than 50 of their plein-air sketches, done on site, along with finished oils, are in this show, which upholds the museum's devotion to traditional academic art. Organized by the Hamburg Kunstalle last year, the show celebrates the 250th birthday of the writer, polymath and art collector Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), whose widely read ''Italian Journey,'' published in 1829, inspired many of the artists to follow in his footsteps. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Glueck).</p>
        <p>BARBARA KRUGER, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Oct. 22). A lot has changed about the art world in the 20 years or so since Barbara Kruger came onto the scene with her snappy photomontages, but a lot has not changed about her work. Her trademark red, white and black text-and-photograph montage is a brand product of the immediate past. Dense and noisy, this retrospective, including audio embellishments, has an intended carnival atmosphere without frivolity. Your reaction will necessarily depend upon a blend of generational sympathy, political concord, aesthetic expectation and tolerance for sarcasm. Ms. Kruger was one of the 80's artists adapting Conceptualism via mass media forms for political ends, thereby helping to broaden the purview of contemporary art and make the art world more sex-balanced. Young artists today reacting against her sort of political stridency now explore subtler, more aesthetically varied routes toward expressions of selfhood. Ms. Kruger, in a sense, helped to pave the way for her own diminished currency, which for a political artist like her may be viewed as a kind of success Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''MAKING CHOICES, 1920-1960,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Sept. 26). The main event at the Modern these days is the museum itself. This has been the case since last fall, when the project ''MOMA 2000'' began the first of what will be three successive top-to-bottom reinstallations of the permanent collection galleries. The affair has been billed as a test drive for the future, a chance for an institution to rethink the modern art tradition that it helped invent and to consider its own identity in what is often called a postmodern world. This second installment, which looks denser, weirder, messier and more truly modern (or maybe postmodern) than the first, is a big leap in the right direction. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>''MANHATTAN CONTRASTS: 20TH-CENTURY PAINTINGS OF NEW YORK,'' New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through Aug. 27). This modest show of 20th-century paintings of New York from the society's collections focuses on painting as documentary representation. This means mostly pictures of buildings seen from near and far, along with a few genre scenes. Quality ranges from journeyman competence to high academic proficiency. But the show is also meant to prompt thought about the society's future collecting, and its most recent acquisition -- a Neo-Pop work by Martin Wong -- suggest a promising expansion of parameters. It is exciting to imagine what this show could look like in the year 2100. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; and $3 for students and seniors (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ALICE NEEL, Whitney Museum of American Art (through Sept. 17). The pleasures of this rewarding exhibition are dampened by the feeling that Neel's long, fruitful career could have sustained a larger effort, one that parses her evolution chapter and verse, on paper and canvas, instead of concentrating on the well-known portraits of her last 25 years. These portraits, which usually feature family members or denizens of the art world, are frequently great and always marvelously loquacious. Color, shape and brushwork, along with Neel's signature distortions of body and face, all have their say, and both the painterly process and the human psyche are repeatedly laid bare. Neel, never less than interesting and always striving, operated in the gap between the Stieglitz circle and the Abstract Expressionists with a fruitfulness matched only by Stuart Davis; like his late work, hers is an indelible part of the postwar period. It's time for a full-dress or, in Whitney terms, a two-floor treatment (Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''PAINTERS IN PARIS: 1895-1950,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Dec. 31). This show of more than 100 paintings celebrates the Met's acquisitions of works by School of Paris painters, going back to 1946 when Gertrude Stein bequeathed her portrait, done by Picasso in 1906. The portrait served as a cornerstone for later acquisitions in the field, particularly over the last 20 years. The museum's increasing interest and diligent wooing of collectors have brought not only single works but also groups and entire holdings, like the 18 major objects bequeathed by Florene M. Schoenborn in 1995 and the Jacques and Natasha Gelman trove of 85 masterpieces accessioned in 1998. The treasures on view include works by some of the 20th century's greatest: Bonnard, Braque, Chagall, de Chirico, Derain, Gris, Leger, Matisse, Miro, Modigliani and Picasso, in an animated arrangement that should beguile the most jaded Met-goer. Hours and admission: See above. (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''MAXFIELD PARRISH, 1870-1966,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art (through Aug. 6). A romantic fabulist who painted in a tight, finicky mode that left out no detail, Parrish (1870-1966) was a highly accomplished illustrator who could be considered the father of Norman Rockwell. As a more aspiring painter, he also pursued a never-never world of chaste but titillating young women and knightly men in pastoral landscapes that melded medieval towers with New England forests, Western gorges and the deep blue skies of fairy kingdoms. This show of more than 140 paintings, drawings, prints, illustrations and ephemera ranges from such well-known Parrish chestnuts as ''Daybreak'' (1922), depicting a young woman's ecstatic awakening to an erotically symbolic dawn, to his coy, cartoonish ''Old King Cole'' mural of 1894. Aside from its campy entertainment value, there is enough here -- particularly his graphic art and some fine landscapes -- to sustain the revival of interest in his work that began with the Pop Art era. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''1900: ART AT THE CROSSROADS,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 10). A wacky exercise in historical simulation, the excuse being a new century. It is hard to remember the last time so many bad pictures were in one place at one time, unless you consider eBay a place. There is also a good deal of excellent art mixed in among the dogs, and sometimes what is best is not what you would expect, which is partly the show's point. We're meant to look anew at a moment 100 years ago when it was not yet clear who would be the pioneers in the 20th century and who would be forgotten. Thus recapturing innocence, we can make connections that for the sake of simplification or because of ignorance art historians have glossed over. The show provides just enough compensatory rewards for its schlock quotient and whatever might be unclear about its inclusionary standards. But patience is required. The weak-hearted and modern-day cultural Pharisees may never get past the shock of confronting so much of the art that the abstractionists were rebelling against in a museum created as a shrine to 20th-century abstraction. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $7, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG: SYNAPSIS SHUFFLE,'' Whitney Museum of American Art (through Oct. 8). Robert Rauschenberg's latest divertissement -- if one may use that word for such a dull performance -- is a group of 52 panels, the number alluding to a full deck of cards, each bearing a mix of photographic images taken by the artist and transferred to the panels' polylaminate surfaces. The images include objects, street scenes, people and natural phenomena, along with snippets from advertising, magazines and newspapers. Involved with the notion of audience participation in his art for many years, Mr. Rauschenberg invited 12 fellow celebrities to ''compose'' their own works, creating ''new'' ones by selecting from several of the panels and placing them in whatever juxtaposition came to mind. The celebrities obliged, among them the television journalist Mike Wallace, the soprano Renee Fleming, the choreographer Merce Cunningham and the talent agent and art collector Michael Ovitz. But aside from the fact that it's a little hard to buy the premise that anyone can create a new work simply by pushing around the artist's components, they had cliched material to work with. The pretentiousness of ''Synapsis Shuffle,'' the celebrity-kissing self-promotion it has involved, and the wasteful allotment of nearly 6,000 square feet of gallery to it at the space-challenged Whitney are not cause for celebration. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''RESERVATION X: THE POWER OF PLACE,'' National Museum of the America Indian, Smithsonian Institution, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, (212) 668-6624 (through Aug. 20). This show of installations by seven artists from Canada and the United States is a lean, clean, impeccably presented take on the tangled subject of what it means to be Native American today. The reservation, as a place and as a state of mind, is the central metaphor. All of the artists were born or have lived on one, and they tend to view these set-aside territories as preserves rather than prisons, places where endangered cultures can, potentially at least, remain both intact and be open to change. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Free (Cotter)</p>
        <p>''TREASURES FROM THE ROYAL TOMBS OF UR,'' Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through Sept. 10). The Sumerians flourished in third-millennium Mesopotamia, creating one of the earliest civilizations as they devised such essentials as writing, numbers, the wheel and irrigation methods. This sumptuous exhibition attests to their visual achievement with gold, silver and carved calcite vessels; weapons, tools and cylinder seals; and ingenious jewelry made of lapis lazuli, carnelian and gold. On view as well are several of art history's most familiar, if least exhibited, masterpieces. All belong to the University of Pennsylvania and are part of one of archaeology's greatest discoveries: the intact, lavishly equipped royal tombs excavated at Ur in the 1920's by C. Leonard Woolley. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6, students and the elderly (Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''WITHOUT SANCTUARY: LYNCHING PHOTOGRAPHY IN AMERICA,'' New-York Historical Society (through Aug. 13). This exhibition scrutinizes a painful chapter in American history with heart-rending clarity: small black-and-white photographs of lynchings that took place between 1880 and 1960: mostly in the South, nearly always with African-American victims. Even more disturbing than the sight of the limp, often tortured and mutilated bodies is the sight of the crowds of white people milling about, sometimes smiling into the camera as if they were at a church picnic or state fair. The extent to which the events were condoned or at least tolerated by society is indicated by accompanying material, including facsimiles of newspapers announcing possible lynchings, and by the images often being sold as postcard mementos. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).</p>
        <p>''THE WORLD OF SCHOLARS' ROCKS: GARDENS, STUDIOS AND PAINTINGS,''  Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Aug. 20). The odd-shaped tabletop objects from China known as scholars' rocks, shaped by nature and human intervention, rate scant mention in art history books. But they enjoyed a vogue in New York as the Pet Rocks of the 1990's. This exhibition wisely places them in the larger context of Chinese culture by setting a choice selection of rocks among historical paintings whose subjects they both echoed and inspired. The paintings, drawn from the museum's constantly rotating collection, are wonderful; the rocks look good, too, and the Met's Ming-style Astor Court, with its own giant moonscape stones, fits right into the prevailing theme. Hours and admissions: See above (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>''THE COLLECTOR AS PATRON IN THE 20TH CENTURY,'' Knoedler &amp; Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through July 31). This two-tiered exhibition honors American collectors present and past. Upstairs an exemplary selection from five private collections summarizes postwar American art. Downstairs a fascinating archival display of correspondence, photographs and color reproductions profiles 28 important American collections, tracing their impact on American museums and offering tantalizing glimpses of their dealings with Knoedler, the oldest art gallery in New York (Smith).</p>
        <p>JOAQUIN TORRES-GARCIA, CDS, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555 (through July 29). This pioneering, peripatetic Uruguayan Modernist is represented in a modest exhibition of small works on paper and several easel-size oil paintings. The show includes early, brusquely painted city and harbor scenes but is devoted mainly to the artist's distinctive combination of grid-based abstraction and cosmic, pictographic symbolism (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>EUGENIE BAIZERMAN, Zabriskie, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-1223 (through next Friday). Baizerman (1899-1949) worked in the shadow of her better-known husband, the sculptor Saul Baizerman. She was too shy to exhibit her paintings more than twice during her lifetime, but this show of mostly paperback-size studies of nudes and still lifes shows she was a serious, intelligent and sensitive painter. All her work is animated by tension between the image and flickering paint. Despite the abstraction there is something psychologically touching about her way with the figure. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>DONALD SULTAN, Mary Ryan, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 397-0669 (through next Friday). In this show of works on paper, Mr. Sultan continues to give rich painterly body to images of apples, eggs and flowers. The main attractions are a six-foot square woodcut of giant green apples overlaid by flat, black egg silhouettes and a dark brown, digitally generated silk-screen image of glowing smoke rings (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>ELLEN BERKENBLIT, Anton Kern, 558 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 965-1706 (through July 29). Ms. Berkenblit's new paintings and drawings cover a lot of bases: Abstract Expressionist brushwork creates shadowy, cobwebby backgrounds for deft Disneyesque drawings of a wistful young woman and her sympathetic animal companions. References to painting, philosophy (Goethe) and the innocence and malaise of youth mingle with suggestions of bohemian Snow Whites and Cinderellas. The results are visually a bit mild but nonetheless convey a complex, thoughtful ambition (Smith).</p>
        <p>''FUNDAMENTAL OCCURRENCES,'' Malca, 580 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-8854 (through July 29). Seven abstract painters deal personally with the basics of surface, pattern and color. The show includes Robin Bruch's allover crystalline webs, Eve Sonneman's allover fields of little circles atop bigger circles, Glenn Goldberg's abstracted blossoms, Harold Porcher's colored stripe permutations, Chris Martin's big and small cosmic boxes on a huge blue canvas, Joe Fyfe's brushy tumbling boxes and Charles Cooper's subtle, gameboardlike watercolors (Johnson).</p>
        <p>RAOUL HAGUE, Lennon Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-0012 (through next Friday). The five monumental sculptures here, each cut from a single piece of walnut, are like Abstract Expressionist paintings turned to living wood; they strongly imply human figures. Carving aggressively but in sympathy with the undulant form and serpentine grain of the log, Hague (1904-1993) created these powerful weddings of art and nature between 1969 and 1978. Here they ride on the wheeled dollies he favored for storage, giving the massive forms a curious lightness and mobility (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''LIVING DOLL,'' the Work Space, 96 Spring Street, (212) 219-2790 (through Aug. 11). Eleven artists play with dolls to intermittently engaging effect. Included are emotionally loaded, painterly images by Ellen Phelan; a touching photograph of a little doll-toting French girl by Sylvia Plachy; Alyson Pou's macabre fragments and transformations; a funny doll family portrait by Elisabeth Condon; and David Levinthal's erotic ''Doll with Whip'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION,'' Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, (212) 343-7300 (through July 29). There are always a few hot summertime group shows that don't make the living feel easy, and this is one. Organized by David Rimanelli, it is titled after Flaubert's notably unsentimental 1870 novel about a good-looking ninny who heads to Paris for the artist's life. And it gathers together a group of interesting young New York and Los Angeles artists. Although the work isn't uniformly strong, it makes an intense cumulative read, like a page of entries from an archskeptic's personal notebook (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''SUMMER SHOW,'' DFN, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 334-3400 (through Aug. 18). Mixed in among the 53 works in this cheerfully uneven hodge-podge of a show are pictures of sunbathers by Joan Semmel; a large, darkly expressionistic beach scene in charcoal by Susan Grossman; small, woozily distorted suburban images by Steve Mumford; a gloomy, swampy landscape painted by William McCarthy; and a painting of a naked sunbather with a strategically placed book by Elyse Taylor (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''TAIGONG FISHING, WILLING TO BITE THE BAIT,'' Jack Tilton Gallery, 49 Greene Street, (212) 941-1775 (through July 31). Chinese-born and Paris-based, Huang Yong Ping has made previous appearances in New York, notably as a Hugo Boss Prize short-lister, but this is his best work here so far. It's an elegantly crafted installation based on a Chinese legend, though the story seem to matter less than the atmosphere of mystery generated by the evocative objects: a fish net hung with lures, copper pans suspended like scales, a world globe that opens like a chest and holds live poisonous insects (Cotter).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>JOHN AHEARN: ''SCULPTURE FROM EAST 100TH STREET, PART 2,'' Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, at 18th Street, (212) 367-7474 (through next Friday). Mr. Ahearn's cast of plaster characters, impressions of his neighborhood friends taken from life, has changed slightly since his 1995 move from the South Bronx to the barrio of East 100th Street. Mostly wall sculptures in half-length or head-and-shoulder presentations, these painted likenesses range from whimsical self-portraits to frolicking teenagers at a New Year's Eve party. The revelers include ''Chris and Starr,'' a couple wearing New Year's Eve hats, linked by Chris's arm as he toots on a toy trumpet; ''KP,'' a boy and girl locked in a kiss, and ''Terrell With Top Pop,'' a well-fed boy who swigs from a soda bottle. Mr. Ahearn, who is very good at conveying in paint the subtle range of flesh tones, portrays himself twice: as a hand-wringing clown with red nose and turned-down mouth, and more introspectively with a pensive face turned toward the wall. New in this work are several unpainted plaster casts of many hands joined together, cast from subjects seated around a table. Suggesting the sculptural reliefs on medieval cathedrals, they add a spiritual dimension to this very human show (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''GAME ON!,'' Sara Meltzer, 516 West 20th Street, (212) 727-9330 (through next Friday). Fourteen artists have fun with sports in this smart and playful show. The two members of Type A wrestle on video; Sylvan Lionni's simulation of a Ping-Pong table and Michael Scott's baseball field on canvas both elegantly parody 1960's-style formalism; Jason Dodge offers a sleek conflation of sports and commodity fetishism; and Christopher Chiappa presents a concrete crash helmet (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ROBERTO JUAREZ: PAINTINGS, Robert Miller Gallery, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774 (through July 29). Gone are the lush blooms and biotica that used to flourish in Roberto Juarez's richly wrought paintings. His current works are New York-based abstractions that play on the garish mix of buildings in the new Times Square, along with elements from his recent paintings of Rome, now pared down to linear essences. True, the mosaics of loops, mazes, convoluted whorls and calligraphic writhings that characterize some paintings don't always make direct allusions. The biggest canvas, ''Times Square Tiles,'' suggests a huge, relaxed coil of beadwork, made up of tiny black and white modules. It evokes strands of genetic material swimming in a primal soup more than it does Times Square. The liquescent effect comes from the pale grounds of pink, green and other less distinguishable tonalities skillfully laid down by Mr. Juarez. These are strong paintings, a nice change of pace for this artist (Glueck).</p>
        <p>GERALD KAMITAKI, Staff USA, 495 Broadway, (212) 925-9700 (through Aug. 26) For his second New York solo show, Mr. Kamitaki has performed a clever, exhaustive exercise in the deconstruction of an art magazine. First he removed every page of the May 2000 issue of Artforum; then he cut neat circles into each and rotated the rings, creating kaleidoscopic alterations. Hung in numerical order, the pages generate an interesting tension between art and journalism (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''KOOL AID,'' Greene Naftali, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 463-7770 (through July 31). Amy Gartrell's hangman's nooses dyed rainbow colors playfully associate this disconnected show's title with the Jim Jones mass suicide; Rob Pruitt projects an old National Geographic special about the panda on a sparkly screen; Yoko Inoue presents scaffolding loaded with ceramic cats and bunnies, bamboo bird cages and old shopping carts; Gareth James shows a paper crutch and a weird tabloid clip; and David Korty's lovely semi-abstract watercolors reflect landscapes of Los Angeles (Johnson).</p>
        <p>100 YEARS OF VERNACULAR SIGNAGE Ricco-Maresca Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-4819 (through Aug. 18). A selection of painted signs and sculpturelike  ''trade stimulators'' examines the strain of commercial Americana that presaged Pop Art, while photographs by Walker Evans, William Klein and others reflect the first artistic appreciation of its merits (Smith).</p>
        <p>''THE THRILL OF IT ALL,'' Ten in One, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 604-9660 (through next Friday). Six young artists scheduled for solo shows next year are previewed in this appealing exhibition. Works include Pam Lins's foam cooler in a pile of fake snow; Walter Andersons's remarkable painted copies of art book photocopies; Carlos Mollura's inflated black Neo-Minimalist sculpture; Carol Jackson's Neo-Pop leatherwork; Stephanie Brooks's funny score-keeping LED sign (''sentiment 16; contempt 2''); and John Spear's wildly funky collage on an old blanket (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''TWO FRIENDS AND SO ON,'' Andrew Kreps, 516A West 20th Street, (212) 741-8849, (through next Friday). The organizers, Jonathan Horowitz and Rob Pruitt, started by selecting Jim Krewson, who shows a kitschy painting of teen idols drinking beer; Mr. Krewson in turn selected one of his friends, who chose a third and so on. The resulting incoherent collection of mostly modest works on paper looks like a student show. Highlights include E. V. Day's eroto-mechanical blueprint; Allison Smith's Masonic apron for George Washington; and Sue deBeer's ghastly photographs (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''WEEGEE: DISTORTIONS,'' Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 23rd Street, (212) 243-0200 (through next Friday). This fantastic show presents the little-seen, underappreciated late work of Arthur Fellig (1899-1968), or Weegee, whose gritty, implicitly Expressionistic camera work both invented and surpassed tabloid photojournalism in the 1930's and 40's. The early 50's found Weegee in Hollywood, inventing mostly in his darkroom and bringing the Expressionistic, often malicious edge of his art into the open. He subjected photographs, both old and new, to a range of abuses: melting negatives, doubling exposures and adding curved or variously textured glass to the enlarger. What he found was, in effect, a ready-made form of caricature. The victims of his distortions include movie starlets and politicians, artists and artworks, whose images are bent and twisted, multiplied and divided to optically amusing, psychologically penetrating and sometimes frightening effect. The images are historically polymorphous as well, belonging equally to the history of Surrealism, political caricature, animation and photo appropriation (Smith).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>''PET SHOW 2000,'' Cynthia Broan, 423 West 14th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 633-6525, (through July 29). Animals are considered, as pets and otherwise, and mostly with tongue in cheek, by 15 artists. On view are Mark Dion's mock Victorian posters advertising the vivisection of a goat; knitted walking outfits for dogs and other animals by Petra Schoenewald; a collapsed, inflatable bunny cast in concrete and painted pink by Tim Thyzel, the show's curator; and, by Rebecca Major, a sweet, straight photograph of a pet rabbit stretched out on a blue rug (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''TOMORROW,'' Rare, 435 West 14th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 645-5591 (through July 29). This noisy, invigorating exhibition is supposed to be about things to come, but it does not really make much sense as a theme show. It includes Beth Campbell's funny, handmade flow chart ''My Potential Future Based on Present Circumstances;'' Tony Matelli's anxious prehistoric men in hyper-real three dimensions; Ryan McGinness's field of plastic toy soldiers called ''Saving Ryan's Privates;'' and a Pop-Minimalist stack of empty fish tanks by Michael Phelan (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>ROBERT ARNESON, ''Me, Myself and I,'' Franklin Parrasch Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360 (through today). One of the zaniest of gifted self-portrayers, the ceramist Robert Arneson (1930-1992) modeled his own head in a multiplicity of guises. A dozen versions appear in this first commercial gallery survey of Arneson likenesses. The concentration is on work done in the 1970's and 80's, from a very pink and benign Santa Claus to a scary, scowling mask in black and white that suggests a searcher scratching at his own dark soul. This show barely hints at the many personas Arneson conjured up, but it does give the sense of a maverick talent in total command of his medium who in his cartoony explorations hit not only on himself but also on everyman (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''HERBERT BAYER: CENTENNIAL,'' Kent, 67 Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-4500 (through today). This small survey celebrates the 100th anniversary of the birth of Bayer, first a student and then a director at the Bauhaus. (He died in 1985.) Bayer worked in many different styles and mediums, from straight photography to Surrealistic montage to cosmic abstract painting. Always wielding a neat, precise touch, he also did graphic and architectural design and advertising. His work is almost always interesting but tends to be more cleverly derivative than deeply original (Johnson).</p>
        <p>DEBORAH BUTTERFIELD, Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 691-6565 (through tomorrow). Ms. Butterfield continues to do what she does so well: making remarkably lifelike images of horses out of found scraps of wood. It is disappointing, however, to discover that the two life-size and four half-size sculptures in this show are actually craftily patinated bronzes cast from original wooden constructions. The bronze adds substance and material luxury but undoes the tension between raw material and animated illusion (Johnson).</p>
        <p>GASTON CHAISSAC, Jan Krugier, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-7288 (through Tuesday). The earliest works in this career survey of this self-taught Frenchman (1910-63) are small pen-and-ink drawings from the late 1930's with the strange, fantastical intimacy of real outsider art. Though buoyant and tightly composed, paintings from the 1950's and 60's -- puzzlelike conglomerations of boldly outlined shapes with cartoon faces added -- look more like the product of professional routine than unique inner vision (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''INNUENDO,'' Dee/Glasoe, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-7545 (through tomorrow). True to its title, ''Innuendo,'' one of the better group shows of the moment, generates a compelling ambience of understated eroticism. Works by 13 artists include a massive Gothic Revival bed by Brian Tolle, a yearbook-style portrait of a winsomely vacant girl by John Currin; intertwined female legs in a snappy, Pop-style gouache by John Wesley; Dana Hoey's clever, photographic update of the Judgment of Paris; and a mesmerizing video by Shannon Kennedy (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''INSIDE OUT: REALITY OR FICTION?,'' Sean Kelly, 43 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 343-2405 (through today). This unusually satisfying, three-pronged approach to the photography of constructed realities includes James Casebere's gloomy pictures of strategically lighted architectural models; photographs of sets for television shows or commercials by Miriam Backstrom; and pictures of real library interiors by Candida Hofer that seem, in this context, strangely artificial (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CHRISTOPHER KENDI; ALEXANDROS GEORGIOU; ROLAND FLEXNER, Curt Marcus, 578 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3200 (through today). In an amusing series of color photographs, Mr. Kendi appears in everyday moments from his own life: shaving, putting on red socks, eating at McDonalds; he has a deadpan, Buster Keatonesque charm. In his photographs, Mr. Georgiou turns still lifes into landscapes by adding small cutout photographs of himself. Mr. Flexner offers fascinating, finely detailed, two-inch circles that result from the meeting of paper and inky soap bubbles (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MARK MANDERS, the Drawing Room, 40 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166 (through Wednesday). Judging by a mysterious, miniature night scene with little cups, draped twine and dried blackened earth inside a vitrine (it calls to mind Giacometti's ''Palace at 4 A.M.''), this young Dutch artist is an interesting sculptor. But his scrawled, surrealistic drawings, all pertaining to an elaborate project called ''Self-Portrait as a Building,'' are too sketchy and elliptical to be as exciting for the viewer as they appear to be for their creator (Johnson).</p>
        <p>LOUIS MONZA, Luise Ross, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 343-2161 (through today). The self-taught Monza, who was born in Italy in 1897 and died in California in 1984, was known for his bold and passionate social-protest paintings. Late in life, however, his art became otherworldly. His preoccupation with issues like environmental pollution and nuclear disaster persists, but in many of the small drawings from the 60's, 70's and 80's here, the serpentine line, radiant light and densely improvised, mythic imagery bespeak a rather psychedelic turn of mind (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''ULRIKE OTTINGER: TAIGA.'' Goethe Institute of New York, 1014 Fifth Avenue, near 82nd Street, (212) 439-8700 (through tomorrow). This small but moving exhibition of photographs by Ulrike Ottinger, an German underground filmmaker, writer and photographer, captures the disappearing world and nomadic life of the Shaman and Tuvan people of Northern Mongolia (Smith).</p>
        <p>''A SELECTIVE SURVEY OF POLITICAL ART,'' John Weber, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-5711 (through tomorrow). This 16-artist show, which inncludes works from the last four decades, is more dryly academic than urgently political. The freshest work is an elaborate, precisely drawn conspiracy diagram by Mark Lombardi; the most sensuous is an embroidered world map by Alighiero E. Boetti. There are works from the early 80's by Jenny Holzer and Barbara Kruger and hand-lettered antiwar texts on postcards made in the 1960's by Ad Reinhardt (Johnson).</p>
        <p>SIMON UNGERS, Henry Urbach Architecture, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-0974 (through today). An architect and artist of inventive and rigorous intelligence presents four models made of rusty, cold-rolled steel that combine powerful sculptural condensation, exacting miniaturistic delicacy and visionary architectural imagination. In these designs for a cathedral, a library, a museum and a theater, conceptions of intricate complexity are clothed in a near-Minimal yet subtly complex vocabulary (Johnson).</p>
