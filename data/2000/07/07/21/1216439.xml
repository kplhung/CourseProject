        <p>Before moving on to more stately affairs (''Forrest Gump'' and ''Contact''), Robert Zemeckis was accomplished at good old-fashioned unclean fun. So it should come as no surprise that he has directed the new thriller ''What Lies Beneath.'' At the start, he zaps us with quick, glib scares, just to show he still knows how, but his heart isn't in this kind of material  anymore. His reflexes are a little slow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zemeckis and his former partner, Bob Gale, honed their skills working on the hammy shock series ''Kolchak, the Night Stalker,'' a creature-of-the-week television show from the late 1970's that inspired ''The X Files.'' But those days of zip and wanton mockery are long behind Mr. Zemeckis. ''What Lies Beneath'' is as implausibly chilling as any ''X Files'' episode. By the last 10 minutes (this movie is two hours and 10 minutes long), your interest will have long vanished.</p>

        <p>Before moving on to more stately affairs (''Forrest Gump'' and ''Contact''), Robert Zemeckis was accomplished at good old-fashioned unclean fun. So it should come as no surprise that he has directed the new thriller ''What Lies Beneath.'' At the start, he zaps us with quick, glib scares, just to show he still knows how, but his heart isn't in this kind of material  anymore. His reflexes are a little slow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zemeckis and his former partner, Bob Gale, honed their skills working on the hammy shock series ''Kolchak, the Night Stalker,'' a creature-of-the-week television show from the late 1970's that inspired ''The X Files.'' But those days of zip and wanton mockery are long behind Mr. Zemeckis. ''What Lies Beneath'' is as implausibly chilling as any ''X Files'' episode. By the last 10 minutes (this movie is two hours and 10 minutes long), your interest will have long vanished.</p>
        <p>The film takes its time in laying out the story of high-strung Claire (Michelle Pfeiffer), who is dissolving into hysteria on a regular basis. Her daughter (Katherine Towne) has just gone off to college. And Claire is still recovering from the trauma of a car accident of a year before, when she was behind the wheel. Then her house starts showing signs of being haunted. Her husband, Norman (Harrison Ford), is a driven research scientist who's never home to offer any emotional support.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pfeiffer plays the kind of damaged-goods housewife with too much time on her hands that is one of the few horror-genre cliches ''Scary Movie'' didn't get around to making fun of. On the other hand, ''Scary Movie'' understood the virtues of brevity. Ms. Pfeiffer stops walking on eggshells about an hour into the movie and shows that she's capable of breaking a few eggs. By this time, the audience knows she is possessed by the spirit of a woman (Amber Valletta) with whom Norman had an affair, and she drops onto him from the ceiling for hot-blooded clinches.</p>
        <p>Between the shameless shocks and with the help of about a third of Ms. Pfeiffer's performance, ''Beneath'' clicks, spottily. The movie is too similar to one of its climaxes, which involves Claire's fighting off the effects of a drug that causes paralysis: the film stumbles around in a stupor, trying to bring its eyes down from the top of its head and wake up before it's too late.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zemeckis has all the externals down cold. He uses long takes and occasionally tosses off a firecracker of a surprise at the end of a scene. There are ominous breezes through the house as a cello saws away on the soundtrack. Diana Scarwid packs her own good time as Claire's fun-loving New Age flake of a pal; her jaundiced squint and hoarse croak of a laugh indicate she would know how to have fun in a haunted house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford shambles through this picture like the real terror, the Creature Without a Pulse. He, too, has the superficial details down to a science, using his voice like a cozy cotton blanket to drop over Ms. Pfeiffer's shoulders. The only surprise in this picture is its audacious torpor; the trailer gives away everything but the price of the large popcorn and Diet Coke special.</p>
        <p>At this point in his career, Mr. Ford knows he needs to try something new, and very early in the film he shows more loose charm than he did in ''Six Days, Seven Nights.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zemeckis, too, wanted to test his skills; he squeezed this movie in during a break from shooting ''Castaway,'' with Tom Hanks.</p>
        <p>The big climax could be right out of ''Tales From the Crypt'' (Mr. Zemeckis served as an executive producer for the cable series based on the 1950's horror comics). Or, for that matter, from ''Kolchak, the Night Stalker.'' It's openly schlocky. Mostly, ''What Lies Beneath'' glazes over faster than a Krispy Kreme doughnut, and neither is very flavorful after sitting around for a while.</p>
        <p>''What Lies Beneath'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes intense scares and violence.</p>
