        <p>It's that time of the quadrennium for fickle viewers to regain their interest in track and field after not caring a whit for it outside of Olympic years when track meets fail to attract all the sport's top stars and the few televised events generate low ratings.</p>
        <p>But 57 days before the opening ceremony at the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, the United States track and field Olympic trials are headed into their final weekend in Sacramento, and anybody who wants to make the Olympic team has to show up.</p>
        <p>These trials, which conclude on NBC Sunday from 7-9 p.m. Eastern, promise tantalizing events, the biggest being Michael Johnson facing Maurice Greene in their 200-meter showdown.</p>
        <p>''Their war of words has been escalating and I expect Don King to pop up at any moment,'' said Tom Hammond, NBC's race caller.</p>
        <p>These trials, which will be seen live in the Eastern and Central time zones, offer a schedule viewers can live by, unlike the taped Sydney Games, when events will be seen up to 15 hours after they occur.</p>
        <p>So, there is a real schedule that NBC cannot package into taped segments. For example, the men's 200-meter semifinals are set for 6:40 p.m. Eastern; the women's 800-meter final will go off at 7:48, the women's 100-meter hurdles final will begin at 8:12 and the men's 200-meter final will start at 8:48 p.m.</p>
        <p>One marquee event, the women's pole-vault final, starts before 7. But the last few vaults are expected to be carried live, including those of the favorite, Stacy Dragila.</p>
        <p>Saturday's 1-3 p.m. coverage is also scheduled to showcase major events late. The first round of the women's 200-meter sprint, featuring Marion Jones, starts at 1:51, followed by the first round of the men's 200 meters at 2:19.</p>
        <p>But make no mistake: the Johnson-Greene sprint -- all 19 to 20 seconds of it -- is the most anticipated event. The race is more of Johnson's specialty; Greene is the world record-holder in the 100.</p>
        <p>If the men's 200 fizzles, it will evoke memories of the 150-meter match race between Johnson and Donovan Bailey in 1997, during which Johnson pulled up before the finish.</p>
        <p>''That was a manufactured event,'' Hammond said. ''This is the real deal.''</p>
        <p>Dwight Stones, an NBC analyst, said he cannot remember a track and field event in America that has generated this much legitimate anticipation since Marty Liquori beat Jim Ryun in 1971's ''Dream Mile.''</p>
        <p>''If they're at 100 percent,'' Stones said of Greene and Johnson, ''this will be incredible. But this is only to make the team. The ones who make it will have nine weeks to prepare for Sydney.''</p>
        <p>He favors Johnson to win, if only because of his experience at that distance.</p>
        <p>''There's a betting line at Harrah's, with Johnson a 5-to-2 favorite,'' Stones said. ''Any time track and field can get that kind of attention, we're happy.''</p>
        <p>Olbermann's Shift</p>
        <p>Now that Keith Olbermann is getting his own Sunday night news, commentary and interview program on Fox Sports Net starting Aug. 6, what will become of ''The National Sports Report,'' Fox Sports Net's flagship show?</p>
        <p>Olbermann was brought in as the lead anchor of ''Fox Sports News,'' the predecessor of ''The National Sports Report,'' but the program has yet to develop another strong personality worthy of being called the lead anchor. Not long ago, Olbermann's face was plastered all over outfield signs and hockey rink boards. You've not seen similar campaigns for Kevin Frazier or Steve Lyons.</p>
        <p>Now Olbermann will be seen once a week, not five times. ''When Keith was hired, the show was a mess,'' said David Hill, chairman of the Fox Sports Television Group. ''Keith's knowledge and abilities went a long way to overcoming it.'' Added Olbermann: ''The goal when I came was to establish us in the same league with ESPN and CNN/SI and that's been largely accomplished. That's less a numerical thing than a conceptual thing.''</p>
        <p>ESPN's ''SportsCenter'' dominates the cable sports news landscape, over CNN/SI and Fox Sports Net. When all three competed at 11 p.m. last year with national shows, ESPN's rating was 2.5 times higher than CNN/SI's, and 3.6 times Fox's, according to ESPN figures.</p>
        <p>According to Fox Sports Net, Olbermann's addition last year did not add to its news program's ratings. From January to June 1999, the show averaged a .7 rating for the 10 p.m. to midnight time block. The rating fell 23 percent to a .54 in the first six months of this year, as Fox Sports Net separated the two-hour block into one from 10 to 11 p.m. and another from midnight to 1 a.m., a lesser-viewed period than 11 to midnight.</p>
        <p>Taking the national program out of the 11 p.m. slot was viewed by ESPN as a capitulation, by Fox Sports Net as a change in its news model.</p>
        <p>Hill said that creating Olbermann's program, making ''The National Sports Report'' more analyst driven and launching the half-hour nightly ''Regional Sports Report,'' now rolling out at 11 p.m. on Fox Sports Net's 21 regional affiliates, are attempts to redefine the sports news formula. ''In TV,'' Hill said, ''you have to be like a shark. Unless you move, you die.''</p>
        <p>Airwaves</p>
        <p>WeMedia Sports, which will Webcast the 2000 Paralympic Games from Oct. 18-29, has made three TV deals: Fox Sports Net will carry a half-hour recap of eight days of competition; PAX-TV will broadcast a half-hour each night, focusing on the personal stories of the disabled athletes; and CBS Sports will carry a two-hour retrospective on Dec. 31 . . . ESPN's Tour de France rating through 17 stages is up 44 percent, while the ESPN2 rating is up 18 percent. For Sunday's final stage, ESPN will carry the last few minutes live, roughly between 10:50 and 11:08 a.m.</p>
