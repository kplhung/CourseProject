      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial agrees with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's move to scale back this year's promised tax cuts for New Yorkers, because of potential budget deficits</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>No longer campaigning for the Senate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani now seems to be directing his full public energies to running New York City. Such renewed focus could bode well for the city's fiscal stability. The mayor who once said he loves cutting taxes, a particularly good stance for a Republican candidate, has now said that he needs to scale back this year's promised tax cuts. A look at the city's potential deficits shows that he is on the right track.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani argues that the budgetary equation has changed since he proposed in January to eliminate the city's personal income tax surcharge. He says that state legislators, eyeing the city's fat surplus during an election year, have made expensive demands about how the city must use it. But if the State Legislature was up to more than its usual mischief, the city's rate of spending growth is also more than twice the rate of inflation. Moreover, the city's borrowing has increased so much that the state had to raise its approved debt ceiling. With such strains on the city's budget, Mayor Giuliani should also consider ways of paying down the municipal debt as part of his effort to scale back future deficits.</p>

        <p>No longer campaigning for the Senate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani now seems to be directing his full public energies to running New York City. Such renewed focus could bode well for the city's fiscal stability.

A look at the city's potential deficits shows that he is on the right track.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani argues that the budgetary equation has changed since he proposed in January to eliminate the city's personal income tax surcharge. He says that state legislators, eyeing the city's fat surplus during an election year, have made expensive demands about how the city must use it. But if the State Legislature was up to more than its usual mischief, the city's rate of spending growth is also more than twice the rate of inflation. Moreover, the city's borrowing has increased so much that the state had to raise its approved debt ceiling. With such strains on the city's budget, Mayor Giuliani should also consider ways of paying down the municipal debt as part of his effort to scale back future deficits.</p>
        <p>The mayor should not be swayed by those Democrats who suggest that his revenue estimates are too conservative, thus making the projected deficits unreasonably large. Mr. Giuliani put it well when he addressed the New York State Financial Control Board on Wednesday. Tinkering with the numbers, he said, would be ''a dangerous game.'' At present, his administration estimates unusually large budget deficits and lower revenue estimates that, in effect, presume a dip in the city's current boom-time fortunes.</p>
        <p>To cut these deficits, the mayor wants to stall or skip the tax cuts, including those negotiated with the City Council and the Legislature. He also plans a hiring freeze. Both moves represent fiscal responsibility, as long as crucial city services are not reduced. The mayor says that when he leaves office after next year, he wants the city to be in better financial shape than it was when he arrived in 1994. That is a sound objective.</p>
