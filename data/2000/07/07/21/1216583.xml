        <p>Fund-raising for the 2001 races for New York City comptroller, public advocate and the five borough presidents has been early and aggressive, according to records released this week.</p>
        <p>The records, filed with the City Campaign Finance Board by each candidate seeking matching public money, show that the largest campaign war chest is held by Kenneth K. Fisher, chairman of the City Council Youth Services Committee; he has raised $523,185 in a crowded race for Brooklyn borough president.</p>
        <p>Herbert E. Berman of Brooklyn, chairman of the Council Finance Committee, who said he planned to run for comptroller, has raised $503,806. Betsy Gotbaum, a former parks commissioner who has announced her intention to run for public advocate, has raised $489,753.</p>
        <p>The fund-raising records were disclosed a week after the release of filings for the 2001 mayoral race, in which Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, Public Advocate Mark Green, the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, and the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, each raised at least $2.8 million.</p>
        <p>Nicole A. Gordon, the executive director of the Campaign Finance Board, said fund-raising for each of the citywide elections and in the races for borough president ''shows an extraordinary amount of activity already in the campaign.'' She attributed the early interest and the large infusion of campaign money to the city's newly imposed term limits, which mean that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Hevesi, Mr. Green and all of the city's borough presidents except C. Virginia Fields of Manhattan must leave office by 2002.</p>
        <p>In the race for public advocate, the records show that State Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer of Manhattan, with $420,754, is second to Ms. Gotbaum in fund-raising. Other candidates include two members of the City Council, Stephen DiBrienza of Brooklyn, chairman of the General Welfare Committee, with $283,017, and Kathryn E. Freed of Manhattan, chairwoman of the Contracts Committee, with $260,065.</p>
        <p>William C. Thompson Jr., the president of the Board of Education and a candidate for comptroller, reported raising $174,658.</p>
        <p>In the race for Brooklyn borough president, Jeannette Gadson, the deputy borough president, reported raising $57,550. Fund-raising results were not available yesterday for Assemblyman Dov Hikind, another announced candidate in that race.</p>
        <p>The fund-raising records show that Sheldon S. Leffler of Queens, chairman of the Council Committee on Public Safety, has raised $79,221 in his campaign for Queens borough president. Two other Council members from Queens are seeking that position: Helen M. Marshall, chairwoman of the Higher Education Committee, with $37,015, and Michael J. Abel, with $12,537.</p>
        <p>Adolfo Carrion Jr., a Council member who is seeking the office of Bronx borough president, reported raising $64,440. Election officials said yesterday that Ms. Fields, who is running for re-election as Manhattan borough president, had raised $232,035 to date.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gordon said the rush to raise money early may also have resulted from changes in the city's campaign finance rules, which offer candidates access to a rich resource of public matching money if they obtain large numbers of small individual donations from voters. The candidates will qualify for $4 in public money for each $1 they raise from city residents who make contributions of no more than $250 each.</p>
        <p>One traditional pattern of New York City elections that does not appear altered by the early fund-raising returns is an overwhelming affiliation with the Democratic Party. All those filing returns by the Monday deadline for the citywide and borough president races were Democrats.</p>
