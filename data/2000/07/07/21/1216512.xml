        <p>Suggesting that her opponent cared more about wealthy campaign donors than about constituents, Hillary Rodham Clinton attacked Representative Rick A. Lazio yesterday for trying to kill legislation in 1998 to expand a program that helps first-time home buyers obtain mortgages.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton questioned why Mr. Lazio had objected to the legislation, since it was intended to benefit people in more expensive areas, including Mr. Lazio's district on Long Island, by raising the limit on the size of mortgages guaranteed by the federal government. The program, run by the Federal Housing Administration, assists first-time home buyers or those with shaky credit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio had vigorously fought the legislation, saying that it was an unacceptable intrusion by government into private industry. The program competes with private mortgage insurance companies, which charge fees to guarantee mortgages.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and a few other senior Republicans were able to scale back the measure before it passed. Less than a month later, Mr. Lazio collected a total of $23,500 in contributions from six of the nation's largest private mortgage insurance companies. The Lazio campaign said recently that the donations were not related to the fight over the loan limit.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mrs. Clinton maintained that Mr. Lazio had betrayed his constituents by opposing a higher loan limit, and said that she would have championed the proposal. ''His opposition meant that if he had prevailed, fewer people in Long Island and in the rest of New York would have been able to afford a home.''</p>
        <p>Asked about the donations to Mr. Lazio, which were reported in The New York Times yesterday, she said, ''We are going to have to let New Yorkers reach their own conclusions about what that means.''</p>
        <p>Bryan Flood, a spokesman for the Lazio campaign, disparaged Mrs. Clinton's comments. ''No one has done more for affordable housing in New York than Rick Lazio as chairman of the subcommittee on housing,'' Mr. Flood said. ''He authored and led the fight for a number of landmark public housing and affordable housing bills. He has an outstanding record. The real question is, where has Hillary Clinton been and what has she done for homeownership in New York?''</p>
        <p>The jousting over Mr. Lazio's record came as both campaigns continued to feud over the contents of fund-raising solicitations.</p>
        <p>A new letter signed by the chairman of the Republican State Committee, William Powers, says Mrs. Clinton is an ''ambitious, ruthless, scheming, calculating, manipulating woman,'' and later refers to her as an ''angry woman whose political views are so far to the left, she has left common sense behind.''</p>
        <p>''She's been at the front and center of every Clinton-Gore scandal and this has been the most seedy, shameless and corrupt administration in American history,'' says the letter, first disclosed yesterday by The Associated Press. Mr. Powers also refers to Mrs. Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, noting that Mrs. Clinton did not send Chelsea to school in New York.</p>
        <p>It was the second strongly worded letter from the state party attacking Mrs. Clinton to surface this month.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has been a powerful lure in fund-raising letters, with Republicans across the nation invoking her name in an effort to generate money from people who dislike her.  Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Lazio's predecessor as Senate candidate, set a fund-raising record in part by tapping into this sentiment.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in Albany, Mr. Powers said the language in the letter was not anti-woman, and was an accurate portrayal of Mrs. Clinton's character. He said he was not concerned that the letter would backfire. ''I've never seen a response to direct mail like we're getting from her,'' Mr. Powers said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, attacked the letter. ''While Rick Lazio smiles for the cameras in public, his Republican allies quietly send out insult-filled letters behind closed doors,'' Mr. Wolfson said in a statement. ''It's time for the hypocrisy to stop. These negative letters signal that Rick Lazio and the G.O.P. have no intention of running a campaign on the issues.''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Giuliani withdrew from the Senate race in May, saying he needed to concentrate on treatment of his prostate cancer, he pledged to help Mr. Lazio. The Giuliani campaign now says it has returned about $3 million to donors, with instructions to make it easy for them to send the money to Mr. Lazio. It is not clear how many have heeded the request.</p>
        <p>Bruce J. Teitelbaum, a senior political adviser to Mr. Giuliani, said the campaign had $3.8 million left and added that Giuliani advisers would be meeting with senior state Republicans in the coming weeks to determine how Mr. Giuliani could use his political operation to help Mr. Lazio and other Republicans.</p>
