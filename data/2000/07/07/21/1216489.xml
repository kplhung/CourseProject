        <p>After years of cleaning up the garbage and pollution that gave the Hudson River a bad name, New York State officials are now trying to bring back public beaches and swimming areas along its shores.</p>
        <p>The Department of Environmental Conservation and the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation have begun a two-year study to develop state-operated public swimming beaches along the Hudson from Manhattan to Columbia County, just south of Albany. The $88,000 study is part of Gov. George E. Pataki's 1996 initiative, the Hudson River Estuary Action Plan, to protect the river.</p>
        <p>''The water quality in the Hudson River has improved dramatically, particularly in the last decade,'' said Jennifer Post, a D.E.C. spokeswoman. ''Obviously, it's a big river and there are some areas where tides or other conditions may make it inappropriate to swim, but we believe there are many locations where swimming is safe and should be encouraged.''</p>
        <p>Although swimmers have dipped into the Hudson River for as long as anyone can remember, extensive pollution from raw sewage and chemical runoffs in earlier decades have made it a less than attractive option for most people. ''Swimming in the Hudson is a longstanding activity, but people used to have to clear a path before they could get in the water,'' said Cara Lee, environmental director for Scenic Hudson, a nonprofit group that monitors the river.</p>
        <p>But state officials and environmentalists say water quality has steadily improved as a result of  pollution controls adopted by government agencies since the 1972 Clean Water Act, which required that sewage be treated before being released into the river. State research shows that most of the river is now safe for swimming, Ms. Post said.</p>
        <p>Currently, swimmers have access to the Hudson  from a handful of public parks operated by local governments, including Croton Point Park in Westchester County and Kingston Point Park in Ulster County. Other swimmers enter the river from private property or boats.</p>
        <p>In April, the state sent out 2,500 questionnaires to businesses, environmental organizations, government agencies and randomly selected residents to solicit suggestions for more public swimming sites. More than half of the forms have been returned,  naming 50 locations from Manhattan to Troy.</p>
        <p>State officials held a meeting tonight at Bear Mountain State Park in Rockland County to discuss the swimming study with local residents. Another meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday in Greene County, and officials will continue to take written comments until Aug. 4. No decision has been made on how many swimming sites would be developed, or how they would be paid for.</p>
        <p>Several environmentalists said today that they welcomed the state's efforts. ''If people are swimming at a place, the government has to make sure the water there is clean enough,'' said Cathy Drew, director of the River Project, a marine biology monitoring station in Manhattan. ''The very best thing we can do for the river is to jump in.''</p>
