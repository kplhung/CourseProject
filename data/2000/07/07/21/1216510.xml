        <p>THINK disasters. Think ''Ghostbusters.'' Put them together and you've just -- too glibly -- summed up Raymond M. Downey's job as chief of Rescue Operations for the New York City Fire Department. It is a job that on a good day makes you feel like a lifesaver, and on bad days, like the day of a Brooklyn brownstone collapse that killed three last week, makes you nothing but numb.</p>
        <p>Before becoming chief of the city's 450-person rescue team (449 men and one woman), he chased fires for 32 years, survived them all without having the thing he calls ''the Red Devil'' catch him. A few of his brethren weren't as lucky (one was crushed by a falling beam that spared Chief Downey and a dozen other firefighters; another was trapped on a window ledge and died from burns after jumping into the bucket of the cherry picker sent to rescue him), which may explain why he spends his vacations retracing historic religious pilgrimages in Portugal, in Yugoslavia, wherever the spirit leads. ''I guess you could call me religious,'' he says.</p>

        <p>THINK disasters. Think ''Ghostbusters.'' Put them together and you've just -- too glibly -- summed up Raymond M. Downey's job as chief of Rescue Operations for the New York City Fire Department. It is a job that on a good day makes you feel like a lifesaver, and on bad days, like the day of a Brooklyn brownstone collapse that killed three last week, makes you nothing but numb.</p>
        <p>Before becoming chief of the city's 450-person rescue team (449 men and one woman), he chased fires for 32 years, survived them all without having the thing he calls ''the Red Devil'' catch him. A few of his brethren weren't as lucky (one was crushed by a falling beam that spared Chief Downey and a dozen other firefighters; another was trapped on a window ledge and died from burns after jumping into the bucket of the cherry picker sent to rescue him), which may explain why he spends his vacations retracing historic religious pilgrimages in Portugal, in Yugoslavia, wherever the spirit leads. ''I guess you could call me religious,'' he says.</p>
        <p>But how to explain three decades of dashing into infernos and flirting with self-immolation? Six hospitalizations? He can't. There was ''this little old lady in Harlem,'' he says, who came close to divining the answer one day as he and his crew answered a call at a burning tenement. ''She says to me, 'Everybody else is running out of that building, and you're running in: you firemen are all crazy!' ''</p>
        <p>Just how crazy?</p>
        <p>''You don't have time for fear, except for when you get back to the firehouse and look at each other and say, 'Wow, we almost bought it.' Then the bell rings and you go fight the next one.''</p>
        <p>Now he specializes in recovering survivors from disasters, whether natural or man-made: a fire, an explosion, a collapsed building, an industrial maiming, a car accident that demands a jaws-of-life extrication. Even travels beyond the city -- he is a task force leader for the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- to help rescue hurricane victims. ''I'm an optimist: I go in for the rescue, not the recovery.''</p>
        <p>He is, he's sorry to say, in the perfect town for a man with his credentials: ''In New York, we have a disaster every day.'' And sometimes, as occurred with the building collapses on July 11 and 13, there's almost too much to contend with.</p>
        <p>''I looked a hundred years old after last week,'' says Chief Downey, 62, who joined the department in 1962, was promoted to his current post in 1995, and whose wife of 39 years, Rosalie, uses his title only on special occasions. ''Like when she says, 'Chief, take out the garbage.' '' (The boss gets bossed around at home, figures it's his just desserts for making his wife worry about him practically every minute he isn't home. Not to mention that two of their sons followed him into firefighting the way he followed his two brothers in.  Now Rosalie Downey worries in triplicate.)</p>
        <p>CHIEF DOWNEY, who was raised in Woodside, Queens,  and lost his father to a construction accident when he was 9, had two options, the Police and the Fire Departments, after he got out of the Marines. ''I chose the better one,'' he says. ''I could have retired 20 years ago. But if I could start over, I'd do it all the same.''</p>
        <p>Chief Downey doesn't keep a diploma in disaster management framed in his office at the firehouse on Roosevelt Island; he wears it: a chest tattooed by live embers that fell inside his uniform, a throat singed and scarred by smoke fumes, brown eyes that have seen what he calls so many ''gory sights'' that the tears no longer come, not even at the Oklahoma City bombing, where he was lent to help supervise the rescue operation. It's only later that the sight of dead children merges in your mind with the faces of your grandchildren, he says.</p>
        <p>Now, after last week's bizarre sequence of building collapses, his feet are sore and blistered from almost 50 hours of crawling through jagged debris in a futile search for survivors at 420 State Street in Boerum Hill, where three died, and again at Houston Street and Second Avenue in Lower Manhattan. The search went better there: no victims.</p>
        <p>Chief Downey had just settled down at the dinner table at home in Deer Park on Long Island when he found out about the State Street collapse: his telephone and beeper gave a simultaneous trill. A bad sign. Off he went to Brooklyn, siren wailing, adrenaline pulsing. When a sneaker attached to a foot was spotted beneath four floors of wreckage after a nightlong search, in he went.</p>
        <p>Even after it was determined that Leonard Walit was dead, Chief Downey stayed in the rubble near the body, flashlight in hand, trying to determine whether Harriet Walit and Khay Cochran might be alive. ''I call it the computer in the helmet,'' he says about keeping going under such circumstances. ''How does a brain surgeon cut somebody's head open? I don't know if I could. But when it's your job, you just do it.''</p>
        <p>After 27 hours of digging, the final body, Mrs. Walit's, was found, cell phone still in hand: so this would be classified a recovery, not a rescue, mission. After 28 hours on the scene, Chief Downey went home to shower and nap, drove to work Thursday at 5:15 a.m., and did not, because of the Houston Street collapse, make it home again until Friday morning. This time he had a note in hand from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who knows him from their shared mandate: they show up at disasters.</p>
        <p>''I told him I was probably in trouble with my wife for not being home all week; I said a note from him would help, so he wrote one,'' he says. ''It got me in the door.''</p>
