        <p>The Scythians, the fierce nomadic tribes of Central Asia that swept as far west as the Danube from the eighth to the fourth century B.C., did not limit themselves to plundering Europe. Skilled horsemen, they rampaged across ancient Eurasia as far east as China. ''Their country is the back of a horse,'' Herodotus wrote.</p>
        <p>The Chinese did not like what was happening. ''The Chinese finally realized that those who controlled the cavalry controlled the world,'' said Jim Lally, a Manhattan dealer in Chinese art. ''It was a whole new technology.'' So they formed their own mounted cavalry.</p>
        <p>''The most important Chinese appropriation from its nomadic neighbors was horseback riding and mounted warfare,'' said Bill Cooke, director of the International Museum of the Horse at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Ky. So, Mr. Cooke said, ''to explore the significance of the horse in the unification of China and in the exchange of culture with the Western world along the Silk Road,'' he organized ''Imperial China: The Art of the Horse in Chinese History.'' The exhibition runs through Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>Four years in the planning, it is one of the largest shows of Chinese artifacts ever seen in the United States. It includes more than 350 artifacts valued at $100 million, with terra cotta tomb sculptures, a reconstructed chariot with its original bronze fittings from about 200 B.C., horses in carved jade, gilded bronze and porcelain, and colorful scroll paintings.</p>
        <p>By 307 B.C., Bill Cooke said, King Wu Ling of the State of Zhao, near the present-day northern border of China, issued an imperial decree that soldiers stop wearing their long robes and adopt nomadic dress so they could ride astride in battle just like their enemies. The soldiers protected their homeland, and before long the horse became an object of great affection in Chinese culture.</p>
        <p>In fact, the horse has had a special place in China's social, religious, economic and military life ever since the Chinese domesticated it for meat, milk and hides about 3000 B.C. ''Throughout China's long and storied past, no animal has impacted its history as greatly as the horse,'' Mr. Cooke said.</p>
        <p>The Chinese believed the ''heavenly horse,'' like the dragon, was capable of flight, even of carrying his rider to the ''home of the immortals'' in the next world. The noble horse inspired ancient philosophers, poets, writers and artists.</p>
        <p>Although the Chinese were not the first to ride horses, they are credited with perfecting two of the most significant inventions in terms of world history: the harness and the stirrup, which ultimately became as important as China's two other fabled creations, paper and gunpowder.</p>
        <p>In the exhibition are some of the earliest life-size sculptures of Chinese horses and their riders. Excavated from a tomb in Shaanxi province in 1977, a cavalryman and his horse are part of the terra cotta army commissioned for the tombs of the Qin dynasty (221 to 207 B.C.). The unglazed horse is saddled up, with studs and tassel decorating his saddle. His master leads him by the reins. The cavalryman wears a tight cap, a short robe, an armored vest, tight trousers and boots. The duo is among 116 cavalrymen and horses discovered in the same excavation.</p>
        <p>By the time of the Han dynasty (206 B.C. to A.D. 220), Chinese emperors realized the need to import horses of superior stock to beat back the barbarians' ever more daring raids. ''China's very survival relied on its equestrian prowess,'' Mr. Cooke writes.</p>
        <p>Obtaining better horses by importing them was not easy, however. In the second century B.C., Emperor Han Wudi sent an expedition to Turkmenistan (then called Ferghana) to buy that region's prized Akhal-Teke, an ancient Eurasian breed of desert horse that was tall, fast, strong and  required little food or water. (It is thought to be the forerunner of the English thoroughbred.) The Chinese called them ''horse of heaven'' or the ''thousand-li'' -- that is, a horse that could run 1,000 li -- a li is about a third of a mile -- without tiring.</p>
        <p>The ruler of Ferghana refused to sell his horses and killed the envoys. The emperor decided to take the horses by force. He sent 6,000 cavalrymen and 20,000 soldiers to Ferghana. The campaign was a disaster. Half the force died in the mountains and deserts en route; the rest were badly defeated in battle. They straggled home two years later, only to face a furious emperor.</p>
        <p>Undaunted, the emperor decided to send yet a larger army. As Mr. Cooke explained, this expeditionary force of 60,000 soldiers and 30,000 horses went West with a herd of 100,000 cattle to sustain them.</p>
        <p>After a 40-day siege of Ferghana, the Chinese collected 3,000 horses, 2,000 of which perished on the return journey. It turned out that only 50 of the captured horses were of the prized breed.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the subjugation of Ferghana persuaded other tribes to cooperate with the Han rulers, ultimately resulting in the opening of the Silk Road. Thereafter, the Chinese traded silk and tea for horses.</p>
        <p>The artistic depictions of horses most associated with China are the magnificent terra cotta horses of the Tang dynasty (A.D. 618 to 907), which remain treasured works of art in the West today.(The record price for one is $6.1 million at Sotheby's London in December 1989.)</p>
        <p>To the Tang, the horse was not only a military necessity but also a status symbol. The Tang used horses for battle, hunting, dressage and polo. Women were allowed to ride. One particularly charming figure in the show is a painted female tomb figure on horseback. She sports a wide-brimmed black hat and a red flowered jacket. Her yellow horse has a red mane and red spots like a modern appaloosa.</p>
        <p>''For the Chinese, who were a sedentary civilization, the horse was a source of joy and pleasure,'' Mr. Lally said.</p>
        <p>Asked about another Tang horse with a female rider in the exhibition, this one glazed in rare blue as well as green and gold, Mr. Lally said: ''The flying-hooves stance is unusual. These horses are from the great artistic center Xian, which was to Tang China what Paris was to Napoleonic France.'' Xian is near the site of the terra cotta army.</p>
        <p>Torkom Demirjian, director of the Ariadne Galleries in Manhattan, pointed out the quality of the Chinese bronze horse trappings in the show. Mr. Demirjian sells some Tang horses, but he is a specialist in Scythian and Thraco-Scythian objects, including horse trappings. He noted the similarities, saying, ''The Chinese had extensive relations with these nomadic peoples long before we think they did.'' He is so impressed with the workmanship of his gold Scythian horse and chariot trappings that he is taking them to Paris to sell at the Biennale des Antiquaires in September.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooke said 80,000 people had visited the Kentucky exhibition since it opened on May 1. He said arrangements with Chinese officials have been problem-free from the start. When he first went to China to discuss doing a show, he was introduced to Zhang Ting Hao, director general of the Administrative Bureau of Museums and Archaeological Data of Shaanxi province, at a banquet. He  told Mr. Zhang his ideas, and Mr. Zhang replied that he had written his master's thesis on the role of the horse in Chinese history. ''That was it,'' Mr. Cooke recalled. ''In 24 hours, we went from an idea to a 10,000-square-foot installation.'</p>
