      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Il Covo dell'Est occupies its corner of the East Village like the neighborhood's favorite uncle. The local style is tough, aloof and highly sensitive to the smallest possible gradations of cool, which makes Il Covo dell'Est, its doors thrown open to the sidewalk, seem like the antidote to everything the East Village stands for.</p>
        <p>The menu is Tuscan, and the atmosphere is uncompromisingly Italian. Within 30 seconds of sitting down, a friendly arm is draped around your shoulder and a booming voice is reciting what seems like the longest list of specials ever assembled at one restaurant. They can distract and detract from the very attractive main menu, which stays regional without lapsing into cliche. The restaurant (whose name the owner translates as the Hangout) has appetizers like spinach flan in a light Gorgonzola and walnut sauce, wonderful shrimp croquettes in asparagus sauce, and fagottini di bresaola, or thin slices of air-cured beef stuffed with goat cheese and herbs.</p>

        <p>Il Covo dell'Est occupies its corner of the East Village like the neighborhood's favorite uncle. The local style is tough, aloof and highly sensitive to the smallest possible gradations of cool, which makes Il Covo dell'Est, its doors thrown open to the sidewalk, seem like the antidote to everything the East Village stands for.</p>
        <p>The menu is Tuscan, and the atmosphere is uncompromisingly Italian. Within 30 seconds of sitting down, a friendly arm is draped around your shoulder and a booming voice is reciting what seems like the longest list of specials ever assembled at one restaurant. They can distract and detract from the very attractive main menu, which stays regional without lapsing into cliche. The restaurant (whose name the owner translates as the Hangout) has appetizers like spinach flan in a light Gorgonzola and walnut sauce, wonderful shrimp croquettes in asparagus sauce, and fagottini di bresaola, or thin slices of air-cured beef stuffed with goat cheese and herbs.</p>
        <p>Florentine gnudi -- sticky balls of spinach and ricotta -- take a classic butter and sage sauce. The rest of the pasta list does what Italy does best, combining dough in a thousand formats with ingredients whose freshness jumps off the plate. The better bets are tagliolini with shrimp and asparagus, and tagliatelli topped with a robust, concentrated meat sauce contributed by the grandmother of Fabio Guelfi, the chef.</p>
        <p>Braised rabbit with olives and tomatoes in a white wine sauce stands out among the meat entrees, although it has a rival in a centuries-old dish called peposo alla fiorentina: boneless beef shank cooked very slowly with red wine, black pepper and sauteed spinach. Another regional oldtimer is cacciucco, a peppery Livornese fish stew here dominated by octopus and squid. The wine list is 100 percent Italian, of course.</p>
        <p>Il Covo dell'Est, 210 Avenue A, at 13th Street, East Village; (212) 253-0777. Dinner entrees, $12.95 to $17.95.</p>
