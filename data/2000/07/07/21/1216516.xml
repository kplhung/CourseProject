        <p>With leaders of the world's industrialized countries gathering in Japan for their annual meeting, a handful of major third world nations took center stage today and lambasted the richest nations on behalf of the world's poor.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in Tokyo on the eve of the Group of 8 summit meeting, which is being held in Japan's southern island of Okinawa, leaders of South Africa, Nigeria and Algeria -- three of Africa's largest countries -- said the major powers had been too slow to act on debt relief and other issues vital to economic growth in the third world.</p>
        <p>''It is no longer a question of what we should do,'' said Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, after he and the third world leaders met with the industrialized leaders. ''We all know what we should do. The question is do we have the political will.''</p>
        <p>The news conference was sponsored by Jubilee 2000, a coalition of charities calling for debt relief for the poor. Mr. Obasanjo is head of a so-called Group of 77, a political coalition of underdeveloped countries, and is also head of the movement of nonaligned nations.</p>
        <p>The comments by Mr. Obasanjo, and similarly spirited remarks made by Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria, were among the few flickers of controversy in a minutely planned diplomatic ballet as delegations from the leading industrial nations -- the United States, Japan, Britain, Italy, Canada, France, Germany -- joined delegates from Russia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obasanjo and his African peers accused the industrialized powers of selfish shortsightedness in their dealings with the third world, where demands to repay heavy debts prevent the poor nations from spending money on vital services like health care and education.</p>
        <p>The anger of the third world presidents was underscored by reports that the industrialized nations would speed debt relief for Russia during the three-day meeting in Okinawa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mbeki said that in addition to debt issues, representatives of rich and poor nations had discussed increasing foreign direct investment in Africa, Africa's access to foreign markets, and the transfer of information technology and biotechnology to Africa, among other things. ''It is a range of things that are interrelated, and it is important that the G-8, when they address these questions, address all of these questions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The African leaders were not met separately by the Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, as they had requested. But Mr. Mori did preside over a meeting between them and leading officials of the industrialized nations, and included them in a dinner tonight.</p>
        <p>The third world leaders also met with executives of several international technology giants, including Sony and Cisco.</p>
        <p>After the talks, Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, standing in for President Clinton, who was arriving late because of the Israeli-Palestinian talks at Camp David, Md., said significant ground had been covered by the two sides. Among the proposals agreed upon were the expansion of debt relief programs beyond the poorest, most heavily indebted countries that had been eligible. They also agreed that the next round of World Trade Organization talks would be devoted to the problems of poor countries.</p>
        <p>Sounding a somewhat skeptical note, Mr. Mbeki said the third world must await the outcome of the summit meetings before gauging how determined the rich nations are to provide more meaningful assistance on the problems of poverty and disease. ''The question of what they will say, that can only come at the end of the Okinawa meeting,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At their last summit meetings last year, the world's richest nations announced with great fanfare a $100 billion debt relief package for 40 of the world's poorest countries. But almost none of the money called for has been disbursed.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration narrowly averted embarrassment over this issue when the House of Representatives voted only last week to finance Mr. Clinton's request for Washington's $262 million share in providing debt relief.</p>
        <p>Again this year, the industrialized nations are promising a number of major initiatives at their summit meeting, and the plans are as sweeping as they have ever been. The meeting itself has been billed as the ''information summit,'' and has set as one of its goals reducing the so-called digital divide -- access to the Internet and other information technology -- between rich and poor countries.</p>
        <p>Toward this end, Japan has pledged to donate $15 billion during the next five years to poor countries to help them spread Internet access and develop information technologies.</p>
        <p>Major goals have also been announced in health care. The industrialized leaders have reportedly agreed on setting a target of 25 percent for reducing AIDS infection among 15- to 24-year-olds in the third world by the year 2010.</p>
        <p>Of all the people who carry the virus that causes AIDS, 70 percent of them live in Africa.</p>
        <p>Here again, Japan has pledged large sums of money -- $3 billion -- to battle AIDS and tropical diseases like malaria in the developing world.</p>
        <p>This week, Washington, too, announced an AIDS initiative for 24 African countries, which will provide them with $1 billion in loans annually to pay for medicine and other treatment to fight AIDS.</p>
