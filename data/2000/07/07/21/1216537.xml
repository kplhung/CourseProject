        <p>Hoping to make it harder for President Clinton to veto a measure they see as having tremendous political appeal, Republicans have unveiled a new version of their tax cut for married couples, but as the bill passed the House today, they promptly found themselves under fire for making the bill cost $44 billion more overnight.</p>
        <p>Republicans said the new version of the tax bill, which House and Senate negotiators agreed to on Wednesday night, responded to the White House's concerns by stripping out a provision in the Senate bill that would have benefited only upper-income taxpayers.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the negotiators decided to speed the timetable for implementing the cuts, starting some cuts this year. That step left the bill with a 10-year cost of $292 billion, amounting to a $44 billion increase in the estimates over that time frame. That handed the administration more ammunition to assert that the bill is too costly.</p>
        <p>Republicans had said on Wednesday that they hoped to defuse the Democratic criticism by agreeing on a revised bill closer in cost to the $180 billion, 10-year measure passed by the House than to the $248 billion, 10-year plan approved by the Senate.</p>
        <p>The administration, which has said that it would veto even the less-costly House version, promptly repeated the veto threat. Congressional Democrats joined in the attack, portraying the Republicans as more interested in scoring election-year debating points than in passing compromise legislation that would mean something to voters.</p>
        <p>''This is no better,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader in the Senate. ''In fact, it's worse than the original version, based on cost alone. I'm disappointed.''</p>
        <p>The House quickly passed the revised bill today on a vote of 271 to 156, with 51 Democrats voting with the Republicans. The Senate, where eight Democrats joined the Republican majority in passing that body's version of the bill on Tuesday, was expected to give its final approval within a day or two.</p>
        <p>Republicans said that by stripping out a provision in the Senate version of the bill that would have benefited only couples whose income put them at the top of the 28 percent tax bracket or above, those earning $106,000 or more this year, they had responded to criticism that the measure was too tilted to the wealthy.</p>
        <p>They said that the bill left plenty of money in the projected budget surplus to deal with other needs like reducing the national debt. And they challenged Mr. Clinton to make good on his claim that he also favors the main goal of the bill, reducing the quirk in the tax code that forces many two-income couples to pay more in taxes than they would if they had remained single.</p>
        <p>''There is no reason on earth that the president should veto this bill,'' said the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois.</p>
        <p>But in a letter sent to Congress today, the treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, listed several.</p>
        <p>''Together with other tax legislation passed by the Congress this year,'' Mr. Summers said, ''it would threaten our fiscal discipline and jeopardize our ability to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, pay down the national debt, enact well targeted tax cuts, provide a long-overdue voluntary Medicare prescription drug benefit and meet other pressing national priorities.''</p>
        <p>The revised bill would immediately double the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly so that it is equal to twice the standard deduction for single filers. Currently the deduction for couples filing jointly is 1.67 times the deduction for single people. Under the Senate version, the change would not have taken effect until next year.</p>
        <p>The measure would gradually expand the income level covered by the 15 percent income tax bracket for married couples to twice the level covered for single filers. The change would be phased in over five years, starting this year. Under the Senate bill, the change would not have started going into effect until 2002.</p>
        <p>The bill would also increase the earned income tax credit, a rebate for low-income working families. But Democrats said the revised bill would offer a smaller increase in the credit than the Senate version.</p>
        <p>With the revisions, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said, the tax would total $292 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>That increase in the price tag from the Senate version left Republicans explaining an oddity about the proposal. An arcane budget rule would make the bill expire in five years, meaning that unless a future Congress extended them, the tax cuts would be canceled just as they were fully phased in.</p>
        <p>Using that to make the best of the situation, Republicans argued that meant the bill's actual cost would be $90 billion, the size of the tax cut over five years, not the $292 billion figure cited by Democrats.</p>
