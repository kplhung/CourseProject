        <p>For months, Vice President Al Gore and other national Democrats have depicted George W. Bush's Texas as all but a third-world country. Pollution? Mr. Gore says Texas is the most polluted state in America. Poverty? Mr. Gore says that too many of Texas' people are poor and that the state does too little for them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore even came to Texas today to continue the criticism, questioning Mr. Bush's handling of the state budget and his priorities as governor. Lagging schools, children without health insurance, pockets of disease -- Mr. Gore's ever-expanding list of Texas woe leaves out mosquitoes and big hair, but it does go on.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Texans, a prideful lot who take a brighter view of things, are indignant.</p>
        <p>''Texas isn't nearly as backward and third world as the Gore campaign would make us out,'' protested Michael Levy, the publisher of Texas Monthly magazine. ''I personally am starting to get offended.''</p>
        <p>There has always been a divergence between the view others hold of Texas and the view Texans hold of themselves, with cliches abounding in both. But the crucible of a presidential campaign seems to have exacerbated the gap and pricked at the old resentments of many Texans, who believe that most outsiders have never understood the state and never will.</p>
        <p>''They're just jealous,'' said Phyllis K. Griggs, the mayor pro tem of McAllen, Tex. ''Texas is bigger than life. People feel they can make fun of it. Have you ever heard anybody make fun of, say, Nebraska?''</p>
        <p>Last week Mr. Levy and four other Texans, none of them unfamiliar with politics or publicity, declared themselves the Proud of Texas Committee. They wrote to Mr. Gore, pledging to defend the honor of their state against his ''misrepresentations.'' In another era, that might have involved pistols; in modern Texas, a news release sufficed. (The release neglected to mention, however, that four of the committee's five members are campaign contributors to Governor Bush, a fact Democratic officials happily pointed out.)</p>
        <p>The Proud committee has pledged to rebut political attacks on Texas, and it had better get busy. Earlier this month the Democratic National Committee, ever helpful in an election year, issued a travel advisory warning that visitors entering the state should check their immunization shots.</p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>Because below-average immunization rates in Houston and elsewhere made Texas ''ripe for epidemic'' -- a playful political swipe that angered local health officials. (In reply, Bush campaign aides noted that Houston's mayor, Lee Brown, is a Democrat and a Gore supporter.)</p>
        <p>Or consider the e-mail message that flashed onto the computer screens of political reporters across the country in May: ''Texas: most manure in America.'' Not exactly the makings of a state slogan, but a report issued by the Sierra Club and Consumers Union showed that farms in Texas generated more animal waste than those in any other state. ''We're definitely No. 1 in No. 2,'' said Reggie James, the director of Consumers Union in Texas.</p>
        <p>Campaigning across the country, Mr. Gore regularly blames Mr. Bush for statistics that show Texas leads the nation in many pollution categories, has one of the highest numbers of children lacking health insurance and still lags in many national education rankings. In recent days, with state spending overruns causing headlines here, Mr. Gore has denounced Texas' fiscal ''mess.''</p>
        <p>''If Governor Bush ran America the way he has run the state of Texas, our prosperity would vanish and our progress would be blocked,'' Mr. Gore said in San Antonio today at a meeting with parents of children who have no health insurance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and his staff have aggressively contested Mr. Gore's attacks, accusing him of misrepresenting some facts and taking others out of context. They say that pollution has declined during the five and a half years of the Bush administration and that the state is doing more to insure poor children. They point to national studies showing educational gains in the state, and fiercely rebut Mr. Gore's fiscal criticism, noting that the state today announced a budget surplus.</p>
        <p>Others rising to the defense of Texas cite the large number of immigrants, legal and illegal, coming across the Mexican border, an influx that often skews state poverty statistics even as cities like Austin, Dallas and Houston are booming.</p>
        <p>They note, too, that Texas has traditionally been a low-tax, low-service state; outsiders may disapprove of that philosophy, they say, but that is a separate debate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore does have some admirers in Texas, and they maintain that regardless of any bruised feelings, the criticism is unavoidable and necessary. ''It's one thing to have your own family point out that you have an ugly house, it's another to have someone else say it,'' said Jim Hightower, the liberal Democrat and former state agriculture commissioner who now writes books and is host of a radio talk show. ''But there it is. It seems to me that we're not in a very good position to whine about what Gore is saying.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, of course, is not indulging in a radical new political tactic. In fact, his role model could well be Mr. Bush's father. In 1988, Vice President George Bush toured Boston Harbor to harangue his Democratic opponent, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, about pollution.</p>
        <p>And in 1992, when Mr. Bush, as president, belittled Bill Clinton's Arkansas as a ''small state,'' Ross Perot, the Reform Party's nominee and himself a Texan, found the theme hard to resist. ''I could say that I ran a small grocery store on the corner,'' Mr. Perot offered as an analogy. ''Therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I could run Wal-Mart. That's not true.''</p>
        <p>No one disputes that Texas is a big place; the debate is over what sort of place it is. Insiders and outsiders have always had a different take. The old stereotype of cowboys and wildcatters is badly dated; modern Texas, with more than 20 million people, is characterized by urban sprawl and increasingly populated by computer processors, lawyers and office workers.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless many Texans still hold dear the self-image that Ann W. Richards spoke of several years ago when, as governor, she dedicated an enormous roadside statue of one of the state's icons, Sam Houston.</p>
        <p>''He is now, as he was then, the image of a Texan,'' she said, ''the image we all believe of ourselves: courageous, strong, ambitious, shrewd, eccentric, sentimental and just a little too rowdy for his own good.''</p>
        <p>The sense of grandeur and of a larger destiny does not always translate to visitors. Some outsiders never seem to get past the hot weather. The Chicago Tribune once described Houston as ''a hot, humid, swampy, colorless flatland metropolis that may already be beyond physical or social redemption.'' In 1994, for the pro basketball finals between the New York Knicks and the Houston Rockets, The New York Post dispatched a sports columnist to offer its own account of the nation's fourth-largest city. ''This Place Is a Hellhole,'' the Post headline concluded.</p>
        <p>Other affronts are subtler. Gregory Curtis, who recently stepped down as editor of Texas Monthly, recalls that guests at a cocktail party in New York seemed genuinely surprised that he had bought his tailored suits in Texas. Mr. Curtis used one of his final columns before leaving the magazine to excoriate the national media, especially The New York Times, accusing them of portraying Mr. Bush and Texas unfairly.</p>
        <p>''There is a suspicion, at least -- or certainly some kind of discontent -- between the East and Texas,'' Mr. Curtis said in an interview. ''There is an assumption that things in Texas are bad and backward and on and on. You find yourself being held accountable for the presumptions of the way that Texas is.''</p>
        <p>T. R. Fehrenbach, an author who is an authority on Texas history, sees an eternal tension between Texans and anyone trying to tell them what to do. ''I don't think Easterners understand the territoriality of the native Texan,'' Mr. Fehrenbach said. ''This isn't new. It goes back to before the Civil War. We are always being pressured by outsiders to get more like them.''</p>
        <p>The outside criticism has in recent weeks spurred a modest tizzy in the state media, spilling from news accounts of the latest Gore broadside to editorial musings about what it all means to Texas.</p>
        <p>''Gov. George W. Bush has more than a presidential campaign at stake,'' William McKenzie of The Dallas Morning News wrote in an editorial last week. ''The idea of Texas itself also is at play in his race for the White House.''</p>
