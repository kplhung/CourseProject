        <p>NEW Yorkers dedicated to social justice and community activism have been grappling with two great challenges: How can they make the city affordable for the many New Yorkers with little disposable income? How can they stop stores from selling stuff at low prices?</p>
        <p>They haven't made much progress with the first one, but they've just scored a victory against low prices. Costco, the discount retailer that had been planning to open large supermarkets in Manhattan, announced last week that the plans were off. It had run into fierce opposition at three proposed locations on the West Side.</p>
        <p>Some of the opposition came from existing merchants and their wholesale distributors, who understandably preferred to see consumers spending more money at their stores. Labor union leaders also had a self-interested reason to object to Costco's nonunion labor force.</p>
        <p>But there was also opposition from some of the very citizens who would benefit from cheap food. Fighting megastores has become a popular ritual among activists throughout the city.</p>
        <p>They object partly on practical grounds, predicting traffic congestion and parking problems. It's understandable why someone living right next door to a suddenly busy store would object, but it seems unlikely that the whole neighborhood would be overwhelmed. If congestion really were such a danger, why would the megastore developer want to build there?</p>
        <p>Customers are not going to patronize a place they can't get to. They'll go to stores without traffic jams. Perhaps some megastore developers are too stupid to consider congestion problems before they build in Manhattan, but they won't be in business for long.</p>
        <p>The critics also object on aesthetic grounds. They complain that family businesses and charming shops are giving way to national chains and big-box stores that don't blend in with the streets or the culture. New Yorkers, the critics say, don't want to live in a suburban mall. It's a variant of argument used in small towns to oppose Wal-Mart: megastores will destroy our special character.</p>
        <p>But the argument makes more sense on Main Street than it does here. Megastores really are a novelty in rural America. In New York they're a tradition. The original megastores were the dry-goods emporiums in downtown Manhattan that transformed retailing in the late 19th century.</p>
        <p>R. H. Macy and the other department-store pioneers put small shops out of business by featuring large selections, low fixed prices (no more haggling) and money-back guarantees. The Sam Walton of the 1860's was A.T. Stewart, whose five-story ''Iron Palace'' took up the whole block of Broadway from 9th to 10th Streets.</p>
        <p>More palatial emporiums were later built between 14th and 23rd Streets on what became known as the Ladies' Mile. By 1892 a tourist brochure could claim without too much hyperbole that ''all America goes to New York for its shopping.'' Tailors must have complained about the cheap ready-to-wear clothes turned out by the city's garment industry, but they couldn't stop the competition.</p>
        <p>SOME of the most successful innovations occurred in the hinterland, like the store offering items for a nickel and a dime that was opened in Lancaster, Pa., by F. W. Woolworth. The Gimbel brothers got their start in Milwaukee. But they and Woolworth soon moved to New York, which welcomed them and the crowds their stores attracted. The city took the best ideas from elsewhere and improved on them.</p>
        <p>After World War II, though, the smart money began avoiding the city. The most innovative merchants were too busy building in the suburbs to deal with the city's arcane zoning restrictions, high costs and political fights. New York became in many ways a retailing backwater.</p>
        <p>Instead of all America coming here to shop, New Yorkers were heading out to suburban malls. New Yorkers have always liked to think that their tastes are too sophisticated for suburbia, but they have recently been spending more than $3 billion a year there.</p>
        <p>Eventually, with the suburbs becoming saturated, the megastore developers began to venture profitably back into New York.  From Home Depot to Staples to Bed, Bath and Beyond, the invaders are winning over the natives. Costco may have been shunned in Manhattan, but tens of thousands of Manhattanites are crossing the East River to shop at the Costco in Long Island City.</p>
        <p>Why, then, do New Yorkers keep fighting these stores? Perhaps the fault is not in the stores but in ourselves. More theories next week.</p>
