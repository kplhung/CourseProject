        <p>Now Playing</p>
        <p>''THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE,'' starring Rene Russo, Jason Alexander and Robert De Niro, with the voices of June Foray and Keith Scott. Directed by Des McAnuff (PG, 88 minutes). Fans of Jay Ward's old ''Rocky and Bullwinkle'' television show will enjoy the first 10 minutes or so of this movie, which employs the show's characteristically flat animation and goofy humor to update the biographies of the beloved flying squirrel, his antlered sidekick and their enemies Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader. But then the antic whimsy of the cartoon original is betrayed as the film turns into a clunky, muddled stew of special effects, lame jokes and labored attempts at satire. Rocky, Bullwinkle and a young F.B.I. agent save the world from Fearless Leader (Mr. De Niro), but who will save it from misguided, overpriced and overhyped movies (A. O. Scott)?</p>

        <p>* ''BUTTERFLY,'' starring Fernando Fernan Gomez and Manuel Lozano. Directed by Jose Luis Cuerda (R, 96 minutes). This gentle, devastating new film, based on short stories by the Spanish writer Manuel Rivas, tells the story of Moncho (Mr. Lozano), a sensitive young boy coming of age in the months before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. The movie touches on the usual excitements and mysteries of childhood, but Moncho's relationship with his teacher, the proudly Republican Don Gregorio, beautifully played by Mr. Fernan Gomez, gives the story an unusual degree of pathos and political complexity (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''CHICKEN RUN,'' with the voices of Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson and Julia Sawalha. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park (G, 86 minutes). The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Nick Park, who also directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Mr. Lord's continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority. ''Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ''Stalag 17'' to ''Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Mr. Gibson, the voice of Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the hens to fly. Finally, it shows that the hens can save themselves through the pluck of Ginger (Ms. Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal of this. It's a great eggscape from banality (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''CHUCK AND BUCK,'' starring Chris Weitz and Mike White. Directed by Miguel Arteta (R, 95 minutes). At the center of Mr. Arteta's funny, creepy and poignant new film is Buck, a 27-year-old man who inhabits the mental world of a preadolescent boy. As played by Mr. White, who also wrote the screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive, an object equally of sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles his attempt to rekindle his childhood bond with his old friend Charlie (Mr. Weitz), who has grown into a distant, self-absorbed careerist. Mr. Arteta's visual sense, Mr. White's insightful script and strong supporting performances from Mr. Weitz and his brother Sam, as well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a kindly theater manager, make this one of the most unusual and affecting coming-of-age stories in some time. ''Chuck and Buck'' is an antidote to the current epidemic of lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore, magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to see this year (Scott).</p>
        <p>''DISNEY'S 'THE KID,' '' starring Bruce Willis, Lily Tomlin and Jean Smart. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 101 minutes). In this cloying throwback to Disney's modest live-action comedies of old, Mr. Willis plays a smarmy image consultant humanized by his encounter with his 8-year-old self (Spencer Breslin), who arrives in Los Angeles via a toy red prop plane. By rights, the movie should be dreadful, and it is thick with therapeutic cliches, but it occasionally soars to heights of not bad, thanks to strong performances from Mr. Willis, Ms. Tomlin and Ms. Smart, and to Audrey Wells's surprisingly clever script (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''GROOVE,'' starring Hamish Linklater, Lola Glaudini, Mackenzie Firgens and Steve Van Wormer. Directed by Greg Harrison (R, 86 minutes). If you're nostalgic for chasing down a rave gig across the city and arriving to find a pair of 16-year-olds discussing the merits of drum and bass versus jungle, then this mostly knowing and funny comedy is just the film for you. Even if you're not, its seductive lack of pretension will win you over. ''Groove'' is a comedy of moments, tracking a crowd through the ups and downs of one night of pleasure at a rave. Mr. Harrison and his team don't try to pretend that raves are anything new or dangerous. Rather, they're an entrenched circuit with specific tribal complications, and this genial picture captures them (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''ME, MYSELF AND IRENE,'' starring Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger. Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly (R, 100 minutes). If ''There's Something About Mary'' offended you with its callous mockery of hair and pet care and its whimsical views of stalking and serial killing, then this latest festival of vulgarity from the Farrelly brothers will make you miserable. But ''Me, Myself and Irene'' shares with their earlier movies a kind of dopey, boyish sincerity and a good-natured sympathy for the underdog that may prove capable of winning over even the dourest spirits. Mr. Carrey, in one -- or is it two? -- of his most charming and repellent performances, plays a Rhode Island state trooper with a split personality and a giant crush on Irene, played with winning moxie and plausible bewilderment by Ms. Zellweger (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE PATRIOT,'' starring Mel Gibson and Chris Cooper. Directed by Roland Emmerich (R, 158 minutes). A grueling Revolutionary War epic that, at more than two and a half hours, seems to take place in real time. The brutality and sentimentality are effective, though the film will leave you feeling used as you exit the theater. This sort-of prequel to Mr. Emmerich's ''Independence Day'' stars Mr. Gibson as a gentle farmer who leads the Colonies in wresting freedom from the Brits, using counterintuitive methods alarmingly similar to terrorism. His anguished masculinity is brandished like a musket. The film's chief asset is his relationship with the young actors playing his children; it draws on the actor's real-life feeling about his own large brood, and his work with them is stirring (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE PERFECT STORM,'' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, John C. Reilly and Diane Lane. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (PG-13, 130 minutes). Impressive but monotonously redundant special effects smother the human drama in this true story (adapted from Sebastian Junger's best-selling book) of a group of swordfishermen battling ''the storm of the century'' off Massachusetts in 1991. Mr. Clooney is the ship's glowering, enigmatic captain, and Mr. Wahlberg and Ms. Lane are the appealing lovebirds who lend the movie its stingy quotient of warmth. The early scenes, which paint a romantic portrait of the fisherman's life in Gloucester, Mass., promise a great deal, but the movie becomes waterlogged once it leaves shore (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>''SCARY MOVIE,'' starring Jon Abrahams, Carmen Electra and Shannon Elizabeth. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans (R, 88 minutes). Mr. Wayans's latest genre-film spoof doesn't so much lampoon the ''Scream'' movies as offer the latest remake, this time as gross-out comedy. ''Scary Movie'' abounds in crude, often stale jokes involving male genitals, female pubic hair, flatulence and dismemberment. There are a few hilarious moments, and some that will provoke guilty laughter, but Mr. Wayans hasn't quite figured out how to parody movies -- like the wildly popular ''Scream'' series -- that already parody themselves (Scott).</p>
        <p>''SHAFT,'' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Christian Bale, Toni Collette and Richard Roundtree. A sequel/remake to the 1971 semiclassic, starring the always dependable Mr. Jackson. He plays the nephew of the original Shaft (Mr. Roundtree, who appears briefly), and this time, Shaft is a cop. He leaves the force to track down a racist WASP murderer (Mr. Bale), who joins forces with a drug dealer (the flamboyant and skillful Mr. Wright) to eliminate the hero. This may be the least politically correct movie in some time, and though it tries to convert archetype into stereotype, it doesn't succeed. Watching the two villains squabble for center stage is like watching Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo in a death match for the mike. But Mr. Jackson comes out on top of this emptily entertaining hodgepodge of retro and modern cliches (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''SUNSHINE,'' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle, Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 180 minutes). In Mr. Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history, Mr. Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family -- grandfather, father and son -- who endure the corruption of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the viciousness of fascism and the brutality of Communism. Mr. Fiennes's performances and those of Ms. Ehle and Ms. Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life) help save the film from melodramatic excess. Even though much of the story is crudely told, ''Sunshine'' is a serious, humane and thought-provoking attempt to make sense of complicated and painful historical experiences (Scott).</p>
        <p>''X-MEN,'' starring Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin. Directed by Bryan Singer (PG-13, 105 minutes). The long-awaited arrival of Marvel Comics' do-gooder mutants is mildly fun on a couple of levels: for one, the acting duel between Mr. Stewart (as the mutant telepath Prof. X,n the X-Men's leader) and Ian McKellen (as the mutant nemesis Magneto, who possesses the power of supermagnetism). As these two austere hams trill their vowels at each other, you get the feeling you really are watching members of another species in action. And Mr. Jackman scores as the two-fisted, confrontational Wolverine, a mutant with superstrength, an ability to heal all wounds and metal-alloy claws that shoot out from his knuckles. He lives to fight, a boisterous tragic hero with no complications. Otherwise, the movie is an earnest affair that's clumsy when it should be light on its feet; it takes itself even more seriously than the comic book does, though its fans may be overjoyed by that devotion (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>ASIAN-AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL. Akira Kurosawa's final film, ''Madadayo,'' about the last days of a revered professor.
