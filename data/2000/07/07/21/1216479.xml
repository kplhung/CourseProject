        <p>For 10 days now, Arab residents of East Jerusalem have followed the reports from Camp David with rising anticipation -- and anxiety.</p>
        <p>For the first time in 33 years, it appears, Israel has signaled a willingness to give up some control of the Arab neighborhoods it annexed here after the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
        <p>What that means in practical terms is still moot. But far from being welcomed as a victory for Palestinian nationalism, the development has roused fears in East Jerusalem of a compromise that would fall short of Palestinian aspirations for full sovereignty, while putting at risk their current jobs, social services and access to Palestinian and Israeli areas alike.</p>
        <p>''It is a very hard time, because people don't know what is going to happen to them,'' said Ahmed Libekert, the Palestinian manager of the largest Israeli-run public health clinic in East Jerusalem. ''My staff keeps asking me. But we just don't know.''</p>
        <p>In Israel, liberal editorialists praised Prime Minister Ehud Barak for ''smashing the taboo'' on discussing a redivision of Jerusalem. But in East Jerusalem, home to 210,000 Arabs, the Israeli offer was widely scorned, as Mr. Barak reportedly refused to consider ceding any Arab neighborhoods to a Palestinian state, offering only limited autonomy.</p>
        <p>For Palestinians, the demand for sovereignty in East Jerusalem is practical as well as ideological. Mr. Barak's talk of ''high fences'' between Israel and an independent Palestinian state has aroused fears of an East Jerusalem severed from its West Bank hinterland.</p>
        <p>There is also much quiet ambivalence about radical political and economic change here.</p>
        <p>Since being involuntarily absorbed into Israel after the 1967 war, the residents of East Jerusalem have overwhelmingly refused to opt for Israeli citizenship. But by Israeli law they are entitled to the same benefits as other city residents.</p>
        <p>Hanan, who would not give her last name, is a 38-year-old mother of six and a regular visitor to Mr. Libekert's clinic. She lives in Beit Hanina, one of the East Jerusalem neighborhoods Israel is said to be willing to cede to Palestinian rule. She says she worries about the possible loss of her Israeli health insurance.</p>
        <p>''Look at Ramallah,'' she said, citing the biggest nearby Palestinian-ruled city. ''There are no health services there like here. There is no proper social welfare system. The Palestinian Authority didn't prove itself in Ramallah, so we are afraid of what they would do here.''</p>
        <p>Randa, a young mother of two whose husband suffers from mental illness, quietly agreed. ''My husband gets treatment in an Israeli hospital,'' she said. ''If he was in Ramallah, they would not have been able to provide him with the proper care.''</p>
        <p>Still, most Arab residents of East Jerusalem look forward to the day when they can fly their own flag, answer to their own courts and even pay taxes to a country that they consider their own.</p>
        <p>''Do you think that because of the few shekels I get from the national insurance, I want to give up my homeland?'' said Khader Jabsheh, 70, from Shufat, an Arab neighborhood that Israel annexed after the 1967 war. ''The insurance I get is my right. It is not a gift from Israel. I have been paying taxes for over 30 years, and I am entitled to get some of this money back.''</p>
        <p>But economic problems are not the only reason some Jerusalem Arabs have misgivings about Yasir Arafat and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
        <p>Many East Jerusalem intellectuals and political activists, fervid supporters of Palestinian independence though they may be, have been openly critical of what they perceive to be the corrupt and autocratic nature of Palestinian Authority rule.</p>
        <p>And some Christian Arabs were alarmed by reports this week that Israel and the Muslim leader of the Palestinians were debating control of Christian churches and residential districts in Jerusalem's Old City. By one account, Mr. Arafat's negotiators were pressing for the area around the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, but were willing to concede to Israel the ancient Armenian Quarter.</p>
        <p>In an unusual joint statement, the three patriarchs of the major Christian churches in Jerusalem lodged a protest against any such division.  They called for ''a system of international guarantees'' of access to the Old City holy sites.</p>
        <p>Most concerns, though, are not spiritual or political, but economic. Many here who adamantly favor a full transfer of sovereignty to a Palestinian state say they expect that change to bring financial hardships.</p>
        <p>Arab residents have long complained about the inequities between municipal services and educational spending in East Jerusalem and Jewish West Jerusalem. Now, with nearby towns in the West Bank under Palestinian rule, the disparities between East Jerusalem and much poorer Palestinian areas have also come into sobering focus.</p>
        <p>Ziad Abu Ziad, who oversees the Palestinian Authority's growing operations in Jerusalem, notes that his department already runs 12 schools with about 15,000 students in East Jerusalem. By next year, Palestinian officials say, they will control the administration and curriculum of most schools in East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Palestinians ''should copy the Israeli system'' and put into effect a similar national health insurance plan, he said.</p>
        <p>Until that point, said Ibrahim Shami, a patient at an Israeli clinic here, Jerusalem Palestinians should be prepared for sacrifices. ''We may lose services, but we will gain a homeland, and this is more important than any loss,'' he said.</p>
