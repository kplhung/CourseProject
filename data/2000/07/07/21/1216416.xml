        <p>''Attaway, Marc, you're right in there -- stick with it,'' my coach, Bobby Gordon, mercifully shouted to me as I churned my legs around the quarter-mile track at the Fort Monmouth Army base in Eatontown, N.J. It was a warm evening in May, and I was running faster than I had in years. A lifelong runner with plenty of marathons and five-kilometer runs under my belt, I sought a new challenge: track racing. My goal was simple, to run a mile.</p>
        <p>While the mile seemed like a simple proposition (four precise laps around the quarter-mile track), the preparation was not. I had to transform myself from an eight-minute-a-mile jogger into a much faster track racer. To spice up the challenge, I gave myself a specific goal -- breaking six minutes. Roger Bannister conquered the four-minute mile in 1954. I would attempt to conquer the six-minute mile in 2000.</p>

        <p>''Attaway, Marc, you're right in there -- stick with it,'' my coach, Bobby Gordon, mercifully shouted to me as I churned my legs around the quarter-mile track at the Fort Monmouth Army base in Eatontown, N.J. It was a warm evening in May, and I was running faster than I had in years. A lifelong runner with plenty of marathons and five-kilometer runs under my belt, I sought a new challenge: track racing. My goal was simple, to run a mile.</p>
        <p>While the mile seemed like a simple proposition (four precise laps around the quarter-mile track), the preparation was not. I had to transform myself from an eight-minute-a-mile jogger into a much faster track racer. To spice up the challenge, I gave myself a specific goal -- breaking six minutes. Roger Bannister conquered the four-minute mile in 1954. I would attempt to conquer the six-minute mile in 2000.</p>
        <p>For inspiration I turned to Bannister. ''I had a moment of mixed joy and anguish when my mind took over,'' he wrote of his historic 3:59.4 mile. ''It drew my body compellingly forward. There was no pain, only a great unity of movement and aim. The world seemed to stand still.''</p>
        <p>I tried to imagine that exaltation  as I ran my training laps with six runners (five other midlife men and a woman in her 20's). My water bottle sat on the metal bleachers, and after each lap, chest heaving and legs aching, I took a long drag.</p>
        <p>''Ready to go,'' Bobby announced after we had jogged a few brief minutes between laps. And we were off again in a blistering test, a long sprint that required power, stamina and faith. Pushing myself with the help of a coach and group was the best way to train for the mile.</p>
        <p>Bobby supervised informal track training year round. You just showed up and ran. The idea of sharing a hard pace was growing. I knew of another group that met weekly at the Fort Hamilton High School track in Brooklyn. In Atlanta one coach offered a weekly track session that he dubbed ''Misery Loves Company Speedwork.''</p>
        <p>When I got the mile itch earlier this year, I scoured the area race schedule and found summer to be the ideal time for my attempt. Because of the heat, running long distance is draining, and many clubs promote short races, on the track and road. At this time of year it's a lot easier -- and certainly more fun -- to run a mile than a marathon. The region's summer ''speed season'' culminates in late September with the Fifth Avenue Mile of the New York Road Runners Club, which features divisions for all ages.</p>
        <p>I had located a series of events a short drive from my home in Monmouth County, N.J. -- the Shore Athletic Club All-Comers Track and  Field Meets, held at Ocean Township High School. The first of four weekly events would be contested in late June. The program included a mile. My race was on.</p>
        <p>If I was to run 5:59 or faster, I needed a systematic approach. It had been 20 years since I had run the mile; then, in my 30's, my goal was 5 minutes. I got as close as 5:08. Now, at 53, I didn't want to fall short again.</p>
        <p>For basic fitness, I kept up my easy five-mile runs a few days a week, along with swimming and bicycling. But I would have to regain some speed, and that's why I forced myself to keep pace with the bunch at Fort Monmouth as we ran a set of six fast quarter-mile laps -- in track parlance, an ''interval'' workout.</p>
        <p>Interval running (also known as ''repetition'' work) is the miler's staple. After a warmup of jogging and stretching, you alternate fast and slow (''rest'') laps, aiming for times that approximate the goal pace for the mile. This trains the body, and mind, to sustain the desired speed for the mile's four laps. It also prepares you for the rhythm of track racing and competing head-to-head with other runners.</p>
        <p>When Steve Scott, the American mile record-holder (3:47.69 in 1982) ran his intervals, he did as many as 20 quarter-mile laps in 57 seconds a lap -- a 3:48 mile pace -- with a short jog between runs. With my sub-6:00 goal, I hoped to train under 90 seconds a lap, and as I finished the first of my six laps, Bobby called off, ''83!''</p>
        <p>Money in the bank. But I had five to go. I decided to key off the faster young woman and sharpen my competitive instincts. I covered the next lap in 85. The sinewy runner was still ahead of me. But her style was to rush out hard; inevitably, she would slow near the end. After another 83, then two 85's, I was closing in on my fading opponent.</p>
        <p>One lap left. Another gulp of water. ''Go,'' said Bobby. I charged after the woman, who had a stride on me halfway around. I felt the bracing fatigue that visits you each lap -- besieged muscles crying for oxygen -- but I wouldn't submit to it. Sure enough, the woman wavered, and arms pumping, I swept around her free and clear and full of life down the home stretch listening for my time.</p>
        <p>''83!'' Bobby called off. Assessing my 84-second average, he added triumphantly, ''Great series!'' I asked Bobby if I was ready to break 6:00. ''As long as you have a finishing kick,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Kick? Nobody said anything about a kick. Bannister and Scott -- they had kicks. So did the current world record-holder, Hicham el-Guerrouj of Morocco. He accelerated his last lap in 55.3 to run 3:43.13 last year. Bobby stressed that even if I could run around 90 seconds per lap for three laps, I would still need some strength in reserve to achieve my goal.</p>
        <p>I turned up at Ocean Township High for my fateful race flush with eagerness but humbled by inconsistency. I had six speed-training days in my legs, half with Bobby, half on my own. But I had lost a week's training to an illness and was sometimes just too tired from work to run very fast.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the evening was just right: cool, overcast, misty. When Bannister ran sub-4:00, he waited for a snapping flag to ease to a gentle flutter. The flag at the Ocean track was still -- a good omen. And what a track it was, a new, fast, polyurethane surface of Olympic caliber.</p>
        <p>This was my Olympics, and when I paid the $3 entry fee, I entertained crazy thoughts of winning the gold medal. Maybe nobody good would show up. But then I saw Harry Nolan, a national masters (40-and-up) champion who could run a 4:40 mile at 53, and a local high school star, Ryan Lavender, who could run 4:30. How about bronze?</p>
        <p>As the kids' sprints were run, I loosened up, sipped from my water bottle and tried to relax. We were called to our marks by the starter, Elliott Denman, a 1956 Olympic racewalker. Nine of us toed the line. For good luck, I wore a pair of old, feathery racing flats that fit like a glove.</p>
        <p>As Denman raised the starter's pistol, I asked Lavender for advice. ''Run even pace,'' he said. He was right, of course.</p>
        <p>''Crack.''</p>
        <p>I strode out comfortably toward the rear behind John Kuhi, a man my age who specialized in the sprints. Around the far turn, my tempo propelled me past Kuhi, and I eased  through the first quarter in 87 seconds, right on target.</p>
        <p>I slowed a touch on the second lap but felt light on my feet as I passed the half-mile in 2:58. On the third lap, a runner whose name I later learned was Bobby Gordon -- same as my coach -- chugged ahead of me. Feeling a sinking nausea, I almost gave up. But I heard people cheering me and rallied to his heels. As we passed the three-quarter together in 4:28, I shot ahead.</p>
        <p>With knees high, I raced furiously down the backstretch. I had a kick! Zipping around the last turn, I groaned across the finish and felt a rush of euphoria as though the weight of life had been lifted. My time was 5:56. Bannister was right: for one precious moment, the world stood still.</p>
