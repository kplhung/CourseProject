        <p>Andy Morales, a Cuban baseball player whose second attempt to defect to the United States was successful on Tuesday, kissed the ground in Miami today.</p>
        <p>''I am happy to be here,'' Mr. Morales said in Spanish in front of the Miami-Dade County Health Department's Refugee Assessment Program office. ''I am just very nervous from the trip.''</p>
        <p>Later in the night, he was released to his father-in-law, Carlos Castillo, who signed a government document promising to be responsible financially for him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morales was given parole status as a refugee.</p>
        <p>He gave a brief statement to reporters in Spanish, saying he was grateful to be here but was very tired and would say more at a news conference on Friday.</p>
