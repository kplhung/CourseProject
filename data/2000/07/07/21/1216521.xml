        <p>Notah Begay III is one of 15 players tied at three under par (69), but he had been alone in first place at seven under until he made a triple-bogey at No. 17 and a bogey at No. 18.</p>
        <p>Begay's adventure at No. 17 included a trip into Swilcan Burn. After hitting his third shot into the burn, Begay went into the valley, took his stance and hit the ball out of the water. The gallery around No. 17 loved it, but after Begay hit his next shot onto the green, he two-putted for the triple-bogey.</p>

        <p>Notah Begay III is one of 15 players tied at three under par (69), but he had been alone in first place at seven under until he made a triple-bogey at No. 17 and a bogey at No. 18.</p>
        <p>Begay's adventure at No. 17 included a trip into Swilcan Burn. After hitting his third shot into the burn, Begay went into the valley, took his stance and hit the ball out of the water. The gallery around No. 17 loved it, but after Begay hit his next shot onto the green, he two-putted for the triple-bogey.</p>
        <p>It was an eventful day for Begay, making his first British Open appearance. A former roommate of Tiger Woods's at Stanford, Begay has won his last two PGA Tour starts and he ended the day within three strokes of the leader, Ernie Els.</p>
        <p>''It was fun getting in the burn,'' the 27-year-old Begay said. ''This is my first under-par round in a major. Granted, it could have been very, very good, but it's a learning process as a young player, and I've got to look at it that way. The whole process was enjoyable. I thought it was fun to go in there and get my feet wet. You don't get a chance to do that much. Once I got in there, both my feet were totally immersed in water. It was something I will always remember. It was a lot more entertaining than taking a boring drop.''</p>
        <p>Despite his shaky finish today, Begay did not sound unnerved. ''I've won golf tournaments and my nerves were not a factor,'' he said.''Everything was in check. We've got three days to go.''</p>
        <p>Flesch Tied With Woods</p>
        <p>Steve Flesch has played very little links golf, but he took an early step toward joining Bob Charles (1963 British Open) as a left-handed major winner. Shooting a five-under-par 67, Flesch was tied with Tiger Woods.</p>
        <p>Though Flesch is one of the PGA Tour's most consistent players, with nine top-10 finishes in 19 starts this year, he has never won a tour event, and he is playing in his first British Open. So Flesch, a 33-year-old native of Cincinnati, hopes to do something rare: capture his first professional victory at a major championship.</p>
        <p>''I've been playing so well on tour, I expected to play well,'' said Flesch, who is 20th on the money list with more than $1.04 million. ''But it's such a different kind of game at St. Andrews. In the states, you try to bomb your tee ball, hit your iron as high as you can into the green, then make the putt. Here, it's a whole other way of playing, a lot of fun. It took me four practice rounds to figure it out. All Americans would agree that putting the ball from 40 or 50 yards off the green is something we are not used to doing.''</p>
        <p>But Flesch adjusted, hitting bump-and-run shots and solid lag putts that kept his momentum going. Asked about being tied with Woods, Flesch smiled and said: ''Has anybody ever heard of him before? If you're around him, you pretty much know you're playing well, because he doesn't play poorly very often. We have three long days ahead of us on a very interesting, penalizing golf course. It's going to be fun.''</p>
        <p>Lawrie's Long Day</p>
        <p>Paul Lawrie, the defending British Open champion, will be fortunate just to make the cut after today's opening-round 78. ''I had one four-putt and three three-putts, and none of them from very long distances,'' Lawrie said. ''I had 41 putts today, which is the most I've ever had in my career. It's ridiculous, really.''</p>
