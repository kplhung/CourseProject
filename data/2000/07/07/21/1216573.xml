        <p>Correction of July 20 article about New Jersey gubernatorial race; Democrat James McGreevey quoted</p>
      </abstract>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article yesterday about the contest between Senator Robert G. Torricelli and Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge for the Democratic nomination for New Jersey governor misstated the context for a statement by Mr. McGreevey. Responding to Mr. Torricelli's suggestion that he was too beholden to a few powerful state lawmakers, Mr. McGreevey said, ''Considering Senator Torricelli's track record, that indeed is a remarkable comment,'' but would not elaborate. Later Mr. McGreevey said he had been implying that the senator had been just as dependent on the same legislators for his election in 1996, and that the comment was not a reference to past questions about Mr. Torricelli's ethics.</p>
