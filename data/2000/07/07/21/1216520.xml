        <p>An autopsy has determined that a brain hemorrhage caused the death of a 10-year-old girl accidentally hit in the head by a plastic toy golf club Tuesday at a state-run day camp for underprivileged children, officials said today.</p>
        <p>The family of the girl, Shadriah Benbow of Paterson, have questioned how a blow from a plastic toy could have killed her, and whether the campers were properly supervised at the camp, in West Milford, N.J.</p>
        <p>But the police there have called Shadriah's death an accident. Thus far, they say, their investigation has found no evidence of criminal intent, negligence or abuse.</p>
        <p>Shadriah was struck as she and two other children waited their turns to swing a hollow, 21-inch plastic club, which is sold in toy stores as the ''Big Boing Golf Club,'' the authorities have said. Shadriah was standing behind a girl taking her swing with the toy club when she was struck.</p>
        <p>The force of the blow ruptured blood vessels and caused fatal bleeding in the girl's brain, said William Purdy, chief assistant prosecutor of  Passaic County. He said Dr. Wayne Williams, an assistant county medical examiner who conducted the autopsy, had found no congenital brain defects or signs of past head injury that might have contributed to the girl's death.</p>
        <p>Mr. Purdy said Dr. Williams believed that a vulnerable part of the child's temple was hit by the rounded tip of the clubhead, focusing all the energy of the swing at the point of contact. He said Dr. Williams believed that if Shadriah had been hit by a flatter part of the clubhead the blow might have been less forceful and not fatal.</p>
        <p>Capt. David Hardin of the West Milford police said detectives had not yet questioned the camp volunteer who was supervising Shadriah and the other children playing the golf game. Consequently, he said, the sequence of events in the moments before the fatal blow remains unclear.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is traumatized over this, and the Police Department is progressing with its investigation and still trying to be sensitive to everybody's needs,'' Captain Hardin said.</p>
        <p>He said detectives had not determined whether Shadriah was standing too close to the girl with the club or walked into the club's path as the girl drew it backward. He also said detectives did not know whether the volunteer had told Shadriah and the others to stay a safe distance away from the girl with the club.</p>
        <p>The volunteer works with state Family Court and is one of several court employees who routinely spend a day at the camp overseeing children, officials say. The camp is run by the Passaic County Probation Department, a branch of the state court system, as a community service. Up to 50 underprivileged children from the Paterson area attend the free camp each week.</p>
