      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>D. C. Moore Gallery  724 Fifth Avenue,  near 57th Street  Manhattan  Through next Friday</p>
        <p>Any artist who arranges objects within small, elegant, glass-fronted wooden boxes cannot escape the long shadow of Joseph Cornell, and Brian Kenny is no exception. His carefully made containers, resembling 19th-century clock cases and other period furniture forms, are often quaintly lined with printed papers in French and other languages, tastefully inflected by a pasted postage stamp or two. They contain assortments of sometimes distasteful things, like cicada carcasses, along with bone fragments, wine glasses (broken and whole), old shoe trees, antlers and wishbones.</p>
        <p>''The Overall Swellness of Mrs. O'Grady'' presents a clear glass vase partly filled with cicada shells and a large oak leaf against a background of printed paper. ''Thoreau to Masefield'' is set up as a wine glass on a gilded pedestal, supported by a bony structure that looks like the skull of an animal, backed by a printed paper.</p>

        <p>For comic relief, there is ''All of Those Damned Thanksgivings,'' a case packed artfully with turkey wishbones.</p>
        <p>Innovative this show is not, but the contrast between the elegance of the cases and their content saves it from being too precious.</p>
