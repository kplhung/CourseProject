        <p>Candidates are used to sharing the stage at presidential debates with television anchors and print reporters. But this year, they may also be joined by Paul Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra.</p>
        <p>David Letterman said on his late-night talk show this week that he had asked Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to appear on his program for a full-scale debate, and that Mr. Gore had immediately accepted.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, Mindy Tucker, said yesterday that the Bush campaign had just received the invitation and was ''happy to consider the offer.''</p>
        <p>Maria Pope, the executive producer of ''Late Show with David Letterman'' and the on-air presenter of the program's tongue-in-cheek ''Campaign 2000'' segments, said that Mr. Letterman was serious about the offer, even if he also said he would award points for the candidates' responses and declare a winner at the end.</p>
        <p>''This is Dave's idea,'' Ms. Pope said. ''He issued the challenge on Tuesday night's show, and threw the gauntlet down to the candidates.''</p>
        <p>Late-night television's political influence is not insignificant. In a recent poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, roughly one in 10 Americans said they routinely gleaned information about the presidential race from late-night shows like Mr. Letterman's.</p>
        <p>Getting Mr. Gore to consent to the encounter was not that hard. Chris Lehane, his campaign press secretary, said that the vice president has already accepted about 40 invitations to debate Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''No real Texan would duck such a challenge,'' Mr. Lehane said. ''Davey Crockett didn't run away from the Alamo. Then again, he was a Tennessean.''</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have already been guests on Mr. Letterman's show, though Mr. Bush made an uncomfortable appearance on the program by satellite during the primaries that was widely viewed as a political minus for him.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pope remains very optimistic. ''We think this will pretty much decide the election,'' she said.</p>
