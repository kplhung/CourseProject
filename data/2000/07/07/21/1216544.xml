        <p>President Clinton jumped from one delicate diplomatic matter to several other ones today as he arrived for an economic meeting of world leaders and immediately tried to make amends to residents of Okinawa fed up with the heavy American military presence on the island.</p>
        <p>''We will continue to do what we can to reduce our footprint on this island,'' Mr. Clinton said this morning at a seaside memorial devoted to the more than 200,000 Japanese, Americans and others who died in 1945 during the fierce fighting of the Battle of Okinawa. ''We take seriously our responsibility to be good neighbors, and it is unacceptable to the United States when we do not meet the responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Before flying here, Mr. Clinton left the Middle East peace talks unfinished back in Washington and aides signaled on his arrival that he was eager to return to Camp David. They said he might scale back his three-day trip here, for the annual meeting of the Group of 8.</p>
        <p>All the same, Mr. Clinton tried to reassure the Japanese, who have poured money and attention into the summit meeting, that it was an important gathering that merited his 14-hour trip. Mr. Clinton is to join the leaders of Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Russia for a series of closed-door meetings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's visit was the first for an American president to this sliver of land since the United States returned Okinawa to Japan in 1972. Mr. Clinton arrived during a particular rocky time in relations between Okinawans and the approximately 26,000 American troops stationed in their midst.</p>
        <p>Okinawans, who lived under United States occupation for 27 years, have long complained that that they suffer from the heavy military presence. There are 37 United States military facilities in Okinawa, representing all the services and taking up tens of thousands of acres. Recent incidents involving wayward soldiers have added to local fury.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton pointed out that the United States has begun consolidating bases on Okinawa, a process that residents complain has been far too slow. The president also emphasized the role Okinawa has played in ensuring stability in the region.</p>
        <p>''I know that the people of Okinawa did not ask to play this role, hosting more than 50 percent of American forces in Japan on less than one percent of its land mass,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>But some Okinawans said the president did not go far enough in his speech. ''He didn't say anything concrete,'' complained Ryo Tengan, 28, a civil servant who was hoping for a presidential announcement of an immediate reduction in troops.</p>
        <p>Zenko Nakamura, 53, an activist who is fighting the relocation of an American Marine base, said, ''I'm disappointed that the president didn't mention what Okinawans care most about -- sexual crimes committed by American servicemen.''</p>
        <p>In advance of the summit meeting, the United States military banned its personnel from drinking alcohol or leaving their bases after midnight, a curfew that followed a hit-and-run accident involving a staff sergeant stationed at the Kadena Air Base.</p>
        <p>Before that, the highest-ranking United States military official in Okinawa issued an apology after a marine was arrested on charges of entering a house and molesting a 14-year-old girl who was sleeping there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's visit was reminiscent of an earlier stop by another American president almost four decades ago. While the island was still under United States control, President Dwight D. Eisenhower stopped briefly in Okinawa on June 19, 1960, during a tour of Asia and faced the same anger displayed for Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Huge crowds of locals turned out to see Mr. Eisenhower, and 1,500 of them began a snake dance to protest the presence of American troops and the failure to return the island to Japanese control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eisenhower ignored the demonstrations in his remarks, calling the American presence a ''splendid example of the mutual benefits that result when people of good will work toward the common goal of peace and friendship in freedom.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton spoke this morning from Cornerstone of Peace Park, a memorial to the soldiers and civilians of Japanese, American and Okinawan ancestry who died here.</p>
        <p>Carved into a granite wall on a seaside bluff, which Mr. Clinton toured with the governor of Okinawa, Keichi Inamine, were the names of 234,183 victims.</p>
        <p>''The Battle of Okinawa was warfare at its most tragic,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''This monument built in its memory is humanity at its most inspired. For here, no grief goes unrecognized. While most monuments remember only those who have fallen from one side, this memorial recognizes those from all sides, and those who took no side.''</p>
