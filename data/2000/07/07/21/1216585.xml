        <p>The American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York said its Web site was broken into this week and material was posted there in support of the actors' strike against broadcast advertisers.</p>
        <p>The organization, which is working with the Association of National Advertisers to counter the effects of the 11-week strike, contacted reporters yesterday to tell them about the disruption to the site. Material sent to reporters showed a headline at the site, www.aaaa.org, addressed to advertisers, declaring that the two associations had been ''telling you lies about the strike.''</p>

        <p>The American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York said its Web site was broken into this week and material was posted there in support of the actors' strike against broadcast advertisers.</p>
        <p>The organization, which is working with the Association of National Advertisers to counter the effects of the 11-week strike, contacted reporters yesterday to tell them about the disruption to the site. Material sent to reporters showed a headline at the site, www.aaaa.org, addressed to advertisers, declaring that the two associations had been ''telling you lies about the strike.''</p>
        <p>O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the agency association, known as the Four A's, said that ''what was put up has been taken down,'' adding that ''we've taken steps'' to improve security at the site. An investigation is under way to determine the identity of those responsible for the posting, Mr. Drake said.</p>
        <p>Greg Krizman, a spokesman for the striking unions, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, said the posting was ''an irresponsible act'' with ''absolutely no connection to SAG or AFTRA''</p>
