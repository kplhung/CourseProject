        <p>Lucent Technologies said yesterday that its financial results would fall short of expectations for the next two quarters, at least in part because the company had been caught off guard by slower demand for traditional communications systems and the rising importance of newer technologies.</p>
        <p>The announcement was the second major disappointment this year for Lucent, North America's biggest maker of communications equipment, and it sent the company's shares down about 16 percent.</p>
        <p>The company attributed a previous warning about its results largely to a failure to fully exploit surging demand for optical communications gear, which transmits information using pulses of light.</p>
        <p>In some ways, that failure could be considered a one-time mistake. But yesterday the company disclosed a deeper set of problems, led by slowing demand for the company's core telephone switches, a product line that has consistently made a big contribution to Lucent's bottom line. In addition, sales of more advanced systems have not picked up the revenue slack as quickly as the company had expected, even as the new products generate smaller profit margins than the old.</p>
        <p>The new chief financial officer of the company said yesterday that many of the company's internal systems were antiquated and that the company could take significant reorganization charges as it tries a makeover.</p>
        <p>And the chairman, Richard A. McGinn, said yesterday that significant changes in Lucent's executive ranks could be announced by the end of the month.</p>
        <p>But not everything is looking down at Lucent, which is based in Murray Hill, N.J. For its third quarter, the company announced earnings that slightly beat analysts' expectations.</p>
        <p>In addition, the unit that makes semiconductors and internal components for optical systems is doing well, and the company said yesterday that it would spin off that division as a separate company. Lucent said it would sell up to 20 percent of the newly independent operation to the public early next year and distribute its remaining stake in the unit to Lucent's shareholders next summer.</p>
        <p>That distribution could prove a windfall for Lucent's holders, but yesterday provided anything but. The company's shares fell $10.375, to $54.25, shaving more than $33 billion from Lucent's market value.</p>
        <p>''This is a disappointment to us,'' Mr. McGinn said yesterday morning in a conference call with financial analysts. ''This isn't in a sense in keeping with the 'contract' we have with our investors. No one is more disappointed about this than I am, and I take this personally. I'm accountable for what happened and for what we need to do to fix it.''</p>
        <p>The most visible part of Lucent's troubles is slowing demand for traditional telephone switches and for the software that powers those switches. Companies like Lucent usually made a lot of their money by selling new software for features like Caller ID, call waiting and three-way calling.</p>
        <p>Now, many communications carriers are placing more emphasis on developing new data and Internet products than on developing new voice features. And when they do introduce new voice features, they are finding ways to do so without being locked into the proprietary software traditionally sold by Lucent and its brethren.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Lucent's new breed of optical and data communications products are taking longer than expected to come to the market in force. The company is also feeling pressure on its earnings because of its cat-and-mouse relationship with some of its own customers.</p>
        <p>''It's like going to a car dealer at the end of the month,'' said Steven D. Levy, a communications equipment analyst at Lehman Brothers. ''Customers behave the way you train them to behave. When you're struggling to make a very aggressive sales target, the customer might not be ready to buy a certain product, so you go to them and say: 'O.K., I need to make my number so I'll give you better terms, or I'll finance it, or I'll discount it.' That's one reason why Lucent's gross margins have been disappointing for four quarters in a row.''</p>
        <p>Lucent also said it lost a big chunk of a major overseas contract but would not identify the customer. Some analysts speculated that it was the Saudi Arabian communications monopoly; others suggested it was a Chinese communications company.</p>
        <p>Either way, underlying all the problems are internal systems that Deborah C. Hopkins, who was named Lucent's chief financial officer in April, describes as largely inadequate.</p>
        <p>''In some ways we are probably still running with AT&amp;T processes,'' Ms. Hopkins said in an interview yesterday, referring to Lucent's legacy as part of AT&amp;T. ''We can now rethink how we do everything. An example would be billing. Why isn't billing on the Web? The more you can simplify billing, the easier it is to collect. That goes to procurement. Why don't we use e-procurement so we can minimize the layers of hand off and the number of people involved?''</p>
        <p>To get back on track in its next fiscal year, the company will probably announce a reorganization within the next few months. ''There could be a sizable charge, but there will be a payback and a business case behind it,'' Ms. Hopkins said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hopkins said that one arena for structural change could be the unit that serves big communications carriers. If that happens, one prime candidate for reorganization would appear to be Patricia F. Russo, an executive vice president who runs that group.</p>
        <p>Lucent said yesterday that its earnings from continuing operations in its fourth quarter, which ends in September, would grow about 15 percent compared with figures in the period a year earlier, leading analysts to say that the company would earn about $1.10 a share this year. The consensus estimate by analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had been $1.27 a share.</p>
        <p>Based on Lucent's other guidance, analysts said the company was now projecting to earn about $1.32 a share for its 2001 fiscal year. The consensus estimate had been $1.55.</p>
        <p>For the most recent quarter, Lucent yesterday reported revenue of $8.7 billion, up 18 percent from $7.4 billion in the period a year earlier. Including special charges, Lucent reported a loss of $301 million, or 9 cents a share, compared with a gain of $763 million, or 24 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Lucent said it would have earned $1 billion, or 30 cents a share, without the charges. Analysts had expected the company to earn 29 cents a share on that basis, according to First Call.</p>
