        <p>Congress has agreed on a plan to eliminate the ''marriage penalty'' long embedded in our tax laws -- the tax advantage that the Internal Revenue Code now confers on couples who choose to live together outside of marriage, or who get divorced. The House has voted to double the standard deduction and the ceiling on the 15 percent tax bracket for married couples, and the Senate is expected to follow suit.</p>
        <p>Though President Clinton has threatened to veto the bill because most of its benefits go to relatively well-off couples, in the end he may find it hard to resist signing a measure that is popular and is advertised as family-friendly.</p>
        <p>But there's a big flaw in this supposed erasure of the marriage penalty: It doesn't erase the marriage penalty. Lawmakers have barely touched one of the tax law's biggest and most socially damaging taxes on matrimony -- the penalty for people eligible for the earned-income tax credit.</p>
        <p>This credit, which benefits the working poor, has done more to reduce poverty than almost any other federal program. But as workers' earnings rise, the tax code imposes a heavy fine on marriage for millions of low-income workers with children.</p>
        <p>The earned-income tax credit pays workers a maximum of $2,353, or $3,888 if the worker has two or more children, but this payment is gradually reduced once earnings increase above $12,690, going down by 16 to 21 cents for each extra dollar earned. The credit phases out entirely at $27,432 in earnings, or $31,152 if there are two or more children.</p>
        <p>The marriage penalty arises because the tax credit calculations use family earnings, not individual earnings. If a single mother lives with her boyfriend, his wages aren't included in figuring her tax credit, since he is not officially a part of her family. Should she marry him, their real joint income will stay the same, but her official family earnings will rise, and her tax credit will go down or disappear.</p>
        <p>The earned-income tax credit's marriage penalty can be huge. Imagine a young woman and the father of her two children, living together as one household, unmarried but hoping to wed. She earns $12,000; he earns $20,000. Under the tax rules, her credit is the maximum: $3,888.</p>
        <p>If they marry, the mother's ''family earnings'' will rise from $12,000 to $32,000. Her credit will go from $3,888 to zero -- a big loss of income for a couple of such modest earnings.</p>
        <p>If Congress is serious about eliminating the marriage penalty in the tax code, it must fix the earned-income tax credit as dramatically as it is fixing the standard deduction and the tax brackets. This low-income marriage disincentive probably turns away far more individuals from wedlock than are discouraged by the other disincentives. Low-income workers, who count every penny, are much more likely to avoid marriages that will cost them dearly than are the high-salaried live-ins that Congress has its eye on helping.</p>
        <p>The Senate and House have agreed to trim the earned-income tax credit's marriage penalty somewhat, for some couples, by increasing the income levels where it applies by $2,000. But most of the marriage penalty remains. The only real solution is to reduce significantly the rate at which the tax credit decreases as income goes up -- in other words, to expand the upper limit of eligibility. Such a change would cost the Treasury more money, but it would make the distribution of benefits more equitable. Why thwart the marital aspirations of those who work for McDonald's and Walgreen's while rewarding the ties that bind the middle class and rich?</p>
