        <p>The Triple Tiara, New York's version of the Triple Crown for fillies, reaches a climax at Belmont Park tomorrow with the $300,000 Coaching Club American Oaks at a mile and one-half. For Secret Status, the race presents a chance to clinch her claim to be recognized as the nation's leading 3-year-old filly.</p>
        <p>Secret Status drew the outside post position yesterday when entries were filed for the Oaks, but that seemed to be no problem for a filly with her record, especially in a short field of seven. She comes into the Oaks with six victories in 10 starts, and she has run in the money nine times.</p>

        <p>The Triple Tiara, New York's version of the Triple Crown for fillies, reaches a climax at Belmont Park tomorrow with the $300,000 Coaching Club American Oaks at a mile and one-half. For Secret Status, the race presents a chance to clinch her claim to be recognized as the nation's leading 3-year-old filly.</p>
        <p>Secret Status drew the outside post position yesterday when entries were filed for the Oaks, but that seemed to be no problem for a filly with her record, especially in a short field of seven. She comes into the Oaks with six victories in 10 starts, and she has run in the money nine times.</p>
        <p>She leaped to the head of this year's class by winning the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs by six and three-quarter lengths, and the Mother Goose Stakes at Belmont by a neck over Jostle, who will break from the No. 5 slot in tomorrow's running.</p>
        <p>''She had some things to overcome in the Oaks, and she did,'' said Neil Howard, who trains Secret Status for her owner, Will Farish. ''I think she settles a lot better around two turns. It's been a maturity thing with her. The breeding says she should get better with time.''</p>
        <p>Secret Status comes with stars in her breeding: She is a daughter of A. P. Indy and a granddaughter of Seattle Slew and Alydar. She also comes with a star jockey in the saddle: Pat Day, who is riding her for the sixth straight time. Day also rode Commendable in the Belmont Stakes at a mile and a half last month, staying close to the pace before charging to the front to win in the homestretch.</p>
        <p>''With Pat riding,'' Howard said, ''you always feel like you have an edge. My only concern, as with every other trainer, is whether your horse can get a mile and a half. She's got the pedigree to do it, but until she actually does it, the jury is still out.''</p>
        <p>Secret Status did not run in the first race in the Triple Tiara series, the Acorn, which was won by Finder's Fee. Winning two of the three races should be good enough to propel her toward the Alabama at Saratoga on Aug. 19. But few fillies in this country have been asked to run a mile and a half, so the Oaks is a major hurdle.</p>
        <p>In the Mother Goose, Secret Status got into a duel down the stretch with Jostle, who had spun six furlongs in a snappy 1:094 5 . And Jostle, owned by Fox Hill Farms, won three stakes last year as a juvenile and the Black-Eyed Susan this year. In the Mother Goose, she gamely tried to withstand the late rush by Secret Status, who prevailed by the length of her neck.</p>
        <p>''I think the Mother Goose was her best race,'' said John Servis, who trains Jostle. ''She never got a breather. When Secret Status ran up to her, she dug in. She had every opportunity to chuck it, and she didn't.''</p>
        <p>In addition to Secret Status and Jostle, the field for the Oaks includes John Peace's Sound of the West on the rail; Zoftig, who lost the Ashland by a nose; Polly Jo, a New York-bred filly; Miss Chief, a turf runner for Bill Mott and Jerry Bailey, and Resort, trained by Shug McGaughey.</p>
        <p>The Coaching Club American Oaks will be run on the next-to-last day of the Belmont meeting. Racing ends on Sunday before switching north for the annual summertime season at Saratoga, starting next Wednesday and continuing through Labor Day, Sept. 4.</p>
