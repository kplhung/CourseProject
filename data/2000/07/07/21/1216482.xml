        <p>Five low-ranked but aggressive riders jumped away early today in the Tour de France, built a lead of nearly 28 minutes through the gingerbread villages of Switzerland and held more than half of it at the finish before enormous crowds in Germany.</p>
        <p>It was the type of exciting day that often develops toward the end of a Tour when the stage is monstrously long and the leaders have their eyes on another day -- a long individual time trial Friday -- and are content to let lesser lights shine.</p>
        <p>The shiniest was Salvatore Commesso, an Italian with Saeco, who won a sprint finish against Aleksandr Vinokourov, a Kazakh with Deutsche Telekom, a German team.</p>
        <p>Commesso finished first by half a bicycle length in 6 hours 8 minutes 15 seconds for the 246.5-kilometer (153-mile) 18th of 21 stages. Commesso's speed of 40 kilometers an hour (a shade under 25 m.p.h.) brought him home 15:40 ahead of the main pack.</p>
        <p>Lance Armstrong, who complained afterward about the length of the stage and the fact that an even longer one is scheduled Saturday, a day before the finish in Paris, continued in the leader's yellow jersey with an unchanged edge of 5:37 in overall elapsed time over Jan Ullrich.</p>
        <p>Bobby Julich could have been, should have been in the breakaway group, but wasn't. He is low-ranked -- 49th place, one hour 37 minutes 40 seconds behind his former teammate and longtime rival, Armstrong. But Julich, 28, an American who rides for the Credit Agricole team from France and finished third in the 1998 Tour, is not aggressive these days.</p>
        <p>A strong climber who has worn the king of the mountains jersey in other races, Julich has been limping home in the gruppetto, the Italian word for the group of riders who work together far behind in the mountains to make sure they all finish within the time needed to avoid disqualification.</p>
        <p>''I'm seeing the Tour de France through different eyes,'' Julich said. ''It's kind of a humbling experience.''</p>
        <p>His troubles in this Tour began on the first day in the Pyrenees, the climb to the Hautacam peak on July 10.</p>
        <p>''The power just wasn't there in the legs in the mountains,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Julich finished nearly 13 minutes behind the winner, snuffing his hopes of standing on the three-step victory podium when the race ends in Paris on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I realized it was over,'' he said, ''and it's kind of difficult to pick up the pieces after that.''</p>
