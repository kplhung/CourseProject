        <p>For a year ''Eagle,'' a monumental sculpture by Alexander Calder, has stood in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Now the 39-foot-high biomorphic steel structure is heading to Seattle, where it is to become the centerpiece of a sculpture park scheduled to open in 2003.</p>
        <p>The Seattle Art Museum announced this week that it had acquired the Calder for its new Olympic Sculpture Park, a six-acre site downtown. The sculpture, which experts say cost more than $10 million, was purchased with a donation by Jon and Mary Shirley, Seattle collectors, to the museum's acquisition fund.</p>
        <p>People close to the deal said Thomas Gibson, a London dealer, represented the Shirleys on behalf of the museum. He declined to comment.</p>
        <p>One mystery is the name of the seller, a group of investors whose identity is being withheld by the Seattle museum.</p>
        <p>In the early 1970's ''Eagle'' was owned by the Fort Worth National Bank and stood in front of its headquarters in Texas. It was bought by Loutex, the Fort Worth real estate development company that bought the bank's building. Loutex sold it to the investors' group several years ago. In April 1999 it left Texas after unsuccessful efforts to find a buyer who would keep it in Fort Worth.</p>
        <p>Nor was anybody willing to buy it for Philadelphia. ''The Calder was lent to the City of Philadelphia through the Calder Foundation,'' said Anne d'Harnoncourt, director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. ''It would have been great if a donor had acquired it and given it to the museum, but that didn't happen.''</p>
        <p>R. C. Rower, a grandson of the artist and the director of the Calder Foundation, said the reason might have been that ''everyone there knows the foundation is going to be bringing large-scale works to Philadelphia.''</p>
        <p>A Calder Museum is planned for a site across the Benjamin Franklin Parkway right across from the Rodin Museum. ''We hope to have chosen the architect by early August,'' Mr. Rower said.</p>
        <p>''Eagle,'' made in 1971, two years before Calder died, is to arrive in Seattle in the fall. ''We're working to find a temporary location until the park opens,'' said Mimi Gates, director of the Seattle Art Museum. The Calder is the first piece earmarked for the sculpture park.</p>
        <p>A Bigger Athenaeum</p>
        <p>The Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford is embarking on its first expansion in 30 years. The oldest art museum in the United States, it occupies five contiguous buildings constructed over 125 years. The expansion will improve circulation and connections among the existing buildings and add a new building to house at least part of the permanent collections.</p>
        <p>''Too many objects have been languishing in our storerooms,'' said Elizabeth Mankin Kornhauser, the acting director. ''As our attendance has increased, it has become more and more been difficult to accommodate visitors.''</p>
        <p>The museum has hired Fox &amp; Fowle, New York architects best know for the new Conde Nast building at 4 Times Square, to become what the Athenaeum calls its ''executive architects.'' It has also asked the artist Maya Lin to create an environmental artwork for the museum's Main Street exterior. Ms. Lin's project is being financed in part by a $2.5 million grant from the State of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''I will be exploring the merger of art, architecture and landscape, the ambiguity of what's outside and what's inside,'' Ms. Lin said. But, she added, ''it is still too early to discuss more specifics, other than to say that I'd like to see art from inside a museum come outside.''</p>
        <p>Ideas she is considering include creating outdoor roomlike spaces for art, perhaps using video artists to invent lighting and commissioning site-specific pieces.</p>
        <p>The main reason Ms. Lin's plans are not fully formed is that the museum has begun an international search for for a design architect, to be chosen by October, to conceive a new building and help renovate and reorganize some of the existing structures.</p>
        <p>Expansion in Denver</p>
        <p>After an intensive six-month search, the Denver Art Museum has selected Daniel Libeskind to design its $62.5 million expansion. Mr. Libeskind, born in Poland and now based in Berlin, has designed a spiral extension for the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and a new home for the Jewish Museum in San Francisco. He is to create a new 146,000-square-foot building, the Denver museum's first major expansion since 1971.</p>
        <p>When completed in 2004, it will nearly double the size of the museum, creating new space for special exhibitions and for its departments of modern and contemporary art and architecture, along with its design and graphics departments. The addition will also include education and multimedia programming and spaces for public events.</p>
        <p>The main building, a 28-sided two-tower structure completed in 1971, was designed by the Italian architect Gio Ponti, who died in 1979. The expansion will use an open area across the street. It will include a 1,000-car garage and a connection to the existing building.</p>
        <p>''We spent a lot of time talking to different architects,'' said Lewis I. Sharp, the museum director. ''We developed a list of 40 architects and narrowed it down to 3.''</p>
        <p>The finalists -- Mr. Libeskind, Thom Mayne of Santa Monica, Calif., and Arata Isozaki of Tokyo -- each gave a public lecture and a daylong workshop, which were shown on cable television.</p>
        <p>When the Victoria and Albert Museum released the design for its extension, neighbors and preservationists opposed the radical glass structure, which resembles a series of tumbling boxes set between two ornate Victorian palaces.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Sharp said he did not think Mr. Libeskind was too racy for Denver. ''This is a young city,'' he said. ''We're prepared and excited to be stepping out.''</p>
