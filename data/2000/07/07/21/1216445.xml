        <p>In museums and galleries Long Island is paying attention to its own, or at least to some of its adopted sons and daughters. They include artists past and present, one art-bedazzled poet and an art-aspiring seasonal migrant, namely Hollywood.</p>
        <p>Parrish Art Museum</p>
        <p>In the exhibition titled ''In Memory of My Feelings: Frank O'Hara and American Art'' at the Parrish in Southampton, art and poetry are having a summertime romance, just as they did during the short life and high times of O'Hara (1926-1966), who vacationed in the area in the 1950's and 60's along with much of the New York art world.</p>
        <p>O'Hara wore many hats -- poet and playwright, critic for Art News, curator at the Museum of Modern Art -- and he wore them with great style. He was a personality-plus sort of presence, a tireless networker and a friend, lover and booster to the many artists and writers pulled into his magnetic field.</p>
        <p>Biographical ink has flowed since he died, hit and killed by a Jeep on a Fire Island beach. Some critics sum up his career as one of alcohol and attitude, period style and social politics. Others who knew him well tend to tell a more complicated story, about a man who was difficult, yes, but wonderful-difficult: supportive, impulsively generous and above all stimulating -- vivifying is really the word -- in ways that excused almost everything else.</p>
        <p>Whatever one's take, his accomplishments are real. He perfected a fleet, urbane, everything's-allowed poetic style that was a breath of fresh air for generations of writers trying to escape academic constrictions, not to mention to poets who had never imagined they could be poets at all.</p>
        <p>And if his own work can tip into brittle chatter, it also has surprising, breath-catching depths. Two of his best-known pieces, ''To the Harbormaster'' and ''In Memory of My Feelings,'' are on my desert-island list of indispensable postwar American poems.</p>
        <p>They also seem to have meant a lot to artists. ''To the Harbormaster'' was written for the painter Larry Rivers. (It's a love poem.) And Jasper Johns borrowed the words ''In Memory of My Feelings'' as the title for one of his most unfathomable paintings, a hinged diptych that seems to be covered with soot and turbulent dark water.</p>
        <p>That painting is in the Parrish show, organized by Russell Ferguson for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. It's a scrapbook of an exhibition, a little of this and a little of that, cohering around O'Hara's outsize personality. A few things he owned are here, notably a de Kooning drawing, along with some scraps of his own art. And appropriately for an impresario-poet who saw himself as a late-model Apollinaire, portraits abound.</p>
        <p>A 3-D cutout by Alex Katz depicts him as a preppy, air-brushed youth; Alice Neel's acid-dipped brush turns him into a gargoyle, an Expressionist fright. Elaine de Kooning sees him as pure posture, with a suave toreador slouch and a splash of lavender for a face. And in Mr. Rivers's heroic 1954 full-length likeness, he's a superstud odalisque -- nude, available and semiaroused -- in combat boots.</p>
        <p>O'Hara collaborated with Mr. Rivers on some loquacious text-and-image lithographs around the same time; they're all here. He also worked with other artists, among them Norman Bluhm, Michael Goldberg and Joe Brainard. Brainard, who died in 1994, was a 22-year-old wunderkind when he and O'Hara paired up, and the fantastic collages they produced (they're basically Brainard's work) are outstanding, as is a short film by Alfred Leslie, ''The Last Clean Shirt,'' for which O'Hara supplied subtitles that amount to cinematic poems.</p>
        <p>The most moving collaborative piece, though, is by Mr. Johns. In 1961 he made a cast of O'Hara's left foot when the poet visited his studio. Then in 1970 he incorporated the cast into a sculpture titled ''Memory Piece (Frank O'Hara).'' The foot is attached to the inside lid of a wooden box over a tray of sand; whenever the lid is lowered, a fresh footprint appears. The exhibition looks good at the Parrish. Modest in scale with an intimate, scruffy archival air and an exceptionally elegant catalog, it's an attractively mixed package, just as O'Hara was.</p>
        <p>His art criticism was vivid but spotty. (Some of his favorites turned out not to be front-runners, and by the mid-60's his taste was slightly behind the curve). His poetry, which is his monument, is alternately richly felt and meretricious. But for the way he brought art and poetry together in a Big Bang fusion and made being a fool in love with art look cool, there's nobody -- nobody -- who can touch him now.</p>
        <p>Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center</p>
        <p>One of the artists with whom O'Hara was most enthralled was Jackson Pollock, who lived on Long Island with his wife, Lee Krasner, from 1945 until his death in a car crash in 1956. (Pollock, Krasner and O'Hara are all buried at the Green River Cemetery in East Hampton.) And this summer the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center in the Springs section of East Hampton has a show that would have made O'Hara smile.</p>
        <p>For a Hollywood film of Pollock's life, set for release this fall, movie versions of well-known Pollock and Krasner works were cooked up, and a selection of these photogenic props, titled ''Not Pollock, Not Krasner,'' is on view in the artists' former home.</p>
        <p>The facsimiles are hand-painted. (Apparently photo-reproductions looked cheesy on film.) And although most are by uncredited members of a production team, not all are anonymous. The film's star and director, Ed Harris, for example, turned out a quite creditable drip painting for the cameras, lacking, perhaps, only that very last dash of true Pollockismo.</p>
        <p>The show is fun, its compare-and-contrast selection of the two artists' work instructive, and the setting cannot be beat. It's moving to see Krasner's paintings, even in replica, hanging in the small upstairs room where she worked. Pollock's barn studio, the real one, with its paint-spattered floor, is close by. And their personal library, still intact on living room shelves, is a priceless slice of cultural history, with Leon Trotsky and John Updike, L. Ron Hubbard and Simone Weil sitting, in vintage editions and in no particular order, side by side.</p>
        <p>Guild Hall Museum</p>
        <p>Vintage paintings make up the fare at the Guild Hall in East Hampton in ''American Impressionism: Treasures From the Smithsonian American Art Museum.'' The museum in Washington, closed for a three-year renovation, is shipping portions of its huge collection out as loan shows to other institutions across the country.</p>
        <p>The sampling at the Guild Hall holds few surprises but makes ideally laid-back summer viewing. Landscapes predominate, some of them classics: Thomas Wilmer Dewing's ethereal, somnambulistic ''Hermit Thrush'' (1890), Whistler's precocious ''Valparaiso Harbor'' (1866) and one of John Henry Twachtman's amazing white-out snowstorms.</p>
        <p>A shyly pugnacious 1876 self-portrait by Will H. Low stands out among the figure paintings, as does one of Mary Cassatt's wildly, weirdly, sensual-secular madonna-and-child tableaus, this one titled ''The Caress'' (1902). And Long Island itself takes the spotlight in William Merritt Chase's ''Shinnecock Hills'' (circa 1895), a view of the bare, moorlike local terrain now giving way to rich-and-famous homes.</p>
        <p>Heckscher Museum of Art</p>
        <p>Closer to New York City, the Heckscher Museum in Huntington has a traveling 30-year retrospective of works on paper by Miriam Schapiro, who lives in East Hampton.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schapiro's career is distinguished. She began as a painter in New York in the 1950's and hit her stride with pioneering feminist work of the 70's. (With Judy Chicago she founded the Feminist Art Program at California Institute of the Arts.) Later in that decade she was associated with the Pattern and Decoration group in New York, artists who incorporated domestic, vernacular and non-Western traditions into their work. All these elements find a place in the show. Collages based on quilt designs incorporate Japanese and Peruvian textile motifs and found materials like aprons, doilies and handkerchiefs. A 1975 lithograph titled ''Re: Art History'' lists the names of dozens of female artists excluded from the history books. (The Guerrilla Girls did the same thing years later.) Other pieces are devoted to specific artists or to Ms. Schapiro's life, and everything she does -- bright in color, dense in visual texture -- is shaped by a painter's eye.</p>
        <p>While at the Heckscher, check out some recently conserved pieces from the collection. The eye-grabber is George Grosz's theatrical ''Eclipse of the Sun,'' which he smuggled out of Nazi Germany folded up in a suitcase and which moldered away in a North Massapequa garage until the museum rescued it. Hanging nearby, less commanding but more endearing, is an unfinished abstract painting -- a ghostly little sea-and-sky thing -- by Arthur Dove, a major American Modernist who was yet another Long Island adoptee.</p>
