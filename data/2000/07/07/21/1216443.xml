        <p>Francois Ozon's new film, ''Criminal Lovers,'' is such an amalgam of fairy tales, old movies and tabloid stories that it never develops a life of its own. It's like the world's chicest term paper, quoting from ''Night of the Hunter,'' ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' ''Gun Crazy,'' ''They Live by Night'' and true crime stories told through the eyes of Larry Clark (the director of ''Kids''), sharing his fixation on the hairless chests of teenage boys. (Some will note resemblances to ''The Blair Witch Project,'' but ''Criminal Lovers,'' which opens today at the Quad Cinema, was completed first.)</p>
        <p>The two central figures are trapped in a world of violence and strangled lust. Alice (Natacha Regnier) persuades Luc (Jeremie Renier) to kill Said (Salim Kechiouche), one of their high school classmates somewhere in France. Alice says Said first ridiculed and then raped her.</p>
        <p>Luc, still struggling with his own sexuality, fatally stabs Said after Alice lures their prey into an extracurricular tryst in the boys' locker room. These early scenes have a drab documentary style. Alice toys with Luc from the outset: his eyes are almost spinning like pinwheels on his withdrawn, impassive face. Mr. Ozon photographs Mr. Renier as a naif, making the boy's long, sad face the emblem of innocence fighting to remain intact throughout the picture.</p>
        <p>Luc and Alice flee the scene of their crime and stumble through the forest, lost and frightened, only to find themselves trapped in the woodland cabin of a wild-eyed, bearded man who sticks them in a hole under his house. The story of Hansel and Gretel is the primary reference here, with Luc being the object of desire of both Alice and the heavy-browed Woodsman (Miki Manojlovic), who tells Luc he likes his boys fattened and his girls thin before he eats them.</p>
        <p>There is a perverse brazenness in Mr. Ozon, as his earlier feature, ''See the Sea,'' made clear. His corrosive deadpan shows up when he chooses to emphasize the setting, lingering on the oppressive verdant beauty of the forest as his murderous Hansel and Gretel run and run and run. At times, the film's mordant absurdity plays with poetry, but of the most self-conscious brand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ozon, who also wrote the screenplay, plays with violence and sex throughout the film. Luc gazes longingly at whatever it is he can't have, and he seems to be equally attracted to Alice and Said. His feelings aside, though, ''Criminal Lovers'' is a terribly cold movie, very good at drawing attention to its sources but not involving on even the simple level of fairy tales, with their capacity for dwelling on native fears. Mr. Ozon's fantasy is sterling-silver-plated and cool to the touch, so the direction feels like nothing more than a form of gamesmanship.</p>
        <p>His intelligence shines through, but at the expense of the characters. By the time Alice and Luc fall into each other's arms and have a bout of soul-cleansing sex while forest animals gambol about their naked bodies -- a smarter-than-the-average-bear riff on Disney nature films -- the whole thing feels like a cool-breeze exercise, with the film giving a detached running commentary on its own content. It's one of those cases where the director trips over his own brains; he's too smart for his own good.</p>
