        <p>After a five-year climb, the number of legal claims accusing New York City police officers of using excessive force or other misconduct has dropped sharply, by 25 percent over the last year, according to city statistics.</p>
        <p>The reduction brings an abrupt end to a period, since 1995, when the number of claims had grown, and suggests that officers may be showing greater restraint on the streets in the aftermath of infamous incidents like the police shooting of Amadou Diallo and the station-house torture of Abner Louima.</p>

        <p>After a five-year climb, the number of legal claims accusing New York City police officers of using excessive force or other misconduct has dropped sharply, by 25 percent over the last year, according to city statistics.</p>
        <p>The reduction brings an abrupt end to a period, since 1995, when the number of claims had grown, and suggests that officers may be showing greater restraint on the streets in the aftermath of infamous incidents like the police shooting of Amadou Diallo and the station-house torture of Abner Louima.</p>
        <p>The decrease in legal claims coincides with two other downturns that have been little noticed amid the sustained public outcry over high-profile cases of police use of force:  the number of police shootings has declined, as has the number of complaints submitted to the Civilian Complaint Review Board. Civilian complaints have decreased by 14 percent over the last six months,  officials said, while police shootings last year were down to 31 from the 43 recorded in 1998.</p>
        <p>At a time when federal prosecutors are arguing that the Police Department does such a poor job of curbing brutality that it may require outside oversight, the city can be expected to cite these decreases as evidence that its own reforms have begun to show results.</p>
        <p>Critics have other explanations for the decreases. City lawyers, they say, may have scared off complainants with tougher negotiating positions, or perhaps the numbers are simply a fluke.</p>
        <p>But the decrease in claims is striking. Legal claims against police officers, which are a precursor to police brutality lawsuits, declined to 1,766 for the 12-month period ended in June, compared with 2,386 filed for the one-year period that ended in June 1999.</p>
        <p>''This is a dramatic one-year reduction,'' said Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, whose office keeps track of all legal claims. ''If the leadership of the Police Department focuses on the necessary reforms, it could be the beginning of a meaningful and important trend that would save the city enormous costs in lives, injuries and dollars.''</p>
        <p>Police officials were quick to credit their innovations for the reductions, citing improvements in training and reforms in the disciplinary process that, they said, had changed attitudes and made officers more wary of misconduct. Two years ago, for example, the department began  integrity testing, in which undercover officers posed as angry citizens in elaborate sting operations intended to weed out officers with a propensity for violence.</p>
        <p>''What is occurring is that police officers are much more cognizant of their responsibility to act with courtesy, professionalism and respect,''  Police Commissioner Howard Safir said.</p>
        <p>Critics remained unconvinced.</p>
        <p>''In recent years, New Yorkers have seen an historical spike in police action claims,'' said Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. ''In light of this history, we should not jump to any quick conclusions based on one year of data as to whether this means there is a decrease in police misconduct.''</p>
        <p>The decrease in legal claims is significant by itself, but it is particularly interesting in light of the reduction in misconduct complaints filed with the civilian review board. In the past, when civilian complaints have declined, critics said the downturn did not constitute evidence of police restraint but of public mistrust in the complaint process. In many cases, they said, people mistreated by the police chose to bypass a complaint process that they viewed as ineffectual in favor of filing a lawsuit.</p>
        <p>As a result, the number of legal claims filed each year has been carefully scrutinized as a second barometer of public dissatisfaction with the police. The claims, technically known as notices of claim, must be filed with the comptroller's office. They serve notice on the city that it is about to be sued by someone who claims to have suffered as a result of police misconduct or mistake. Most  are filed by people who say they are victims of police brutality.</p>
        <p>Since 1995, the number of claims alleging police misconduct or mistakes has risen each year except one, 1998, when it dipped by 8 percent. Last year's 2,386 claims appear to have been the most ever filed.</p>
        <p>Even with the 25 percent drop this year, Mr. Siegel said, the number of claims is still higher than the 1,500 claims typically filed annually a decade ago. But police officials said that  comparison was unfair because those numbers were recorded before the merger of the transit and housing police into the Police Department, a 1994 change that added 7,000 officers to the force.</p>
        <p>The reduction in claims over the last 12 months may present a budgetary bonus for the city as well. Last year, the city paid a record $40 million to resolve claims and lawsuits in police cases, up from $28 million the year before.</p>
        <p>Joel Berger, a lawyer who monitored police misconduct cases for the city and who now represents plaintiffs in brutality cases, said that he thought a large part of the decline in claims was attributable to new strategies the city was employing to control these settlement costs. In the past year or so, he said, city lawyers have adopted a tougher negotiating stance in misconduct cases and are offering much smaller settlements. The tactic, he said, has scared off some lawyers who in the past might have taken on less sensational, less lucrative, but legitimate misconduct cases.</p>
        <p>''It does not necessarily mean that those cases are not arising,'' he said. ''It's just that my segment of the bar is becoming more realistic.''</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Berger said one client he represented in 1998, whose home had been mistakenly searched based on a faulty warrant, received a $200,000 settlement. In a very similar case he has now, Mr. Berger said, the city has offered only $3,000.</p>
        <p>Daniel S. Connolly, a lawyer who supervises the city's litigation in police misconduct cases, said he agreed with Mr. Berger that the city's negotiating stance was firmer. But he said that stance did not dissuade people with legitimate claims.</p>
        <p>''The people who get scared away,'' he said, ''are the people who did not have meritorious claims to begin with.''</p>
