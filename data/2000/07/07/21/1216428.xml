        <p>In ''Pokemon the Movie 2000,'' Pikachu and his fellow mystical creatures pursue two new adventures. This program, which seems to have been cobbled out of several episodes of the syndicated television series from Japan, is probably about as good as cut-rate animation that seems to consist of screen savers can be.</p>
        <p>The first of the two films is ''Pikachu's Rescue Adventure,'' a short. And since the entire program runs less than 90 minutes, what does that make the main feature? Probably way too long for the uninitiated, but that's another story.</p>

        <p>In ''Pokemon the Movie 2000,'' Pikachu and his fellow mystical creatures pursue two new adventures. This program, which seems to have been cobbled out of several episodes of the syndicated television series from Japan, is probably about as good as cut-rate animation that seems to consist of screen savers can be.</p>
        <p>The first of the two films is ''Pikachu's Rescue Adventure,'' a short. And since the entire program runs less than 90 minutes, what does that make the main feature? Probably way too long for the uninitiated, but that's another story.</p>
        <p>In the first of the two offerings, Pikachu, the little yellow character with black ears, and his mates, including Squirtle (who resembles a turtle), Snorlax (a penguin with a thyroid problem), Psyduck (a pink tailless platypus) and others, are off to assist several other Pokemon of an eggy sort during an intense and driving rainstorm. With the exception of some complaints voiced by Meowth -- the Pokemon associate of Team Rocket, the bad guys -- no English is spoken.</p>
        <p>Instead, the short is filled with Pokemon speak and has no subtitles, and it's an inventive way for youngsters to learn a new language. It may be a language they'll be able to use only at Pokemon conventions, or as a way to irritate their parents. Still, some small amount of educational purpose is better than none at all. The Pokemon known as Exegutter emerges by the end, and his name's pronunciation is so similar to executor that some may think the Pokemon have finally found a creature to help plan their estates.</p>
        <p>In the main feature, Ash, the young trainer who traps and nurtures Pokemon -- and is often the star of the adventures with Pikachu -- has to stop the menacing Collector, a nasty sort who is caging up Pokemon with tremendous powers.</p>
        <p>''The way you talk, Pokemon are just things to collect,'' Misty, a member of Ash's team, says to the Collector in English -- a remark that will doubtless provoke mirthless laughter from parents.</p>
        <p>A peculiar dialogue exchange occurs when someone tells Ash, ''If you want someone to do whatever you want, whenever you want, you should find yourself a girlfriend.'' Unfortunately, we do not get to see how this piece of advice complicates Ash's dating life. Perhaps we will in ''Pokemon 3000,'' by which time someone else can disentangle the unwieldy plot machinations found in ''Pokemon 2000,'' which quieted the children with whom I saw it because they, too, were lost.</p>
        <p>One suspects this is called ''Pokemon the Movie 2000'' not just to remind parents how much cash they have spent on Pokemon products to date, but also because the end of the world is threatened. The millennial message is that one person can make a change, though that person is, as usual, Ash. He vows to stop the Collector from capturing the Pokemon representing the elements of nature, like Moltres (a fire-breather) and  Zapdus (who sends out lightning bolts). This would upset the Earth's elemental balance. Even Jessie and  James, the villainous Team Rocket, elect to help Ash.</p>
        <p>Several new Pokemon are introduced, but perhaps the most notable is Ash's mother, Ms. Ketchum. She gives the young adventurer, who wears a hat with an insignia that looks suspiciously like the Lexus logo, a piece of her mind and reminds him that he is her greatest treasure. At this point, parents can gather their greatest treasures and take them home before the end credits.</p>
