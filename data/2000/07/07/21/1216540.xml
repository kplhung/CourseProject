        <p>Visitors to Yankee Stadium yesterday would be forgiven if the baseball game passed unnoticed, if they were distracted by the parade of snow-white clouds outlined in blue. Midsummer felt like early fall, incredibly.</p>
        <p>But the ballgame passed by the Yankees, as well. One moment they had a comfortable lead and their pitcher was dominating. Soon they were in their clubhouse, puzzled, trying to understand how they lost to the Detroit Tigers, 5-3. It is a recurring theme for the Yankees, who have repeatedly failed to break away from the other contenders in the mediocre American League East. ''We felt like our pockets were picked,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>Being the object of theft is a passive act. The Yankees played an active role in this defeat, their 41st in 90 games this year; it should have never come to that.</p>
        <p>Detroit (43-49) is without Tony Clark and Juan Gonzalez -- both sluggers are on the disabled list -- and the Tigers are playing mostly with journeymen. They came to New York on a 36-hour road trip, a poor team that could be taken out easily. Roger Clemens struck out 11 Tigers over eight innings on Wednesday and won by 9-1, and yesterday David Justice and Jorge Posada ripped home runs in the second inning to give the Yankees and Andy Pettitte a 3-0 lead.</p>
        <p>The Yankees flubbed a scoring chance in the fifth inning, when they had runners at first and second and one out and could not add to their total. Still, their advantage was three runs, Pettitte's fastball had sizzle -- he was on the way to striking out 10 batters -- and there was nothing to suggest the Yankees might lose this game.</p>
        <p>Pettitte (9-6) walked Damion Easley, the Tigers' leadoff hitter, to open the sixth inning, a mild problem that became something of a crisis when Pettitte threw two pitches out of the strike zone to the next hitter, Shane Halter, who had drawn only five walks this season. Posada, the Yankees catcher, jogged to the mound, where he was joined by Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach. Posada reminded Pettitte to focus on Posada's glove, to follow through.</p>
        <p>But Pettitte was panicking a bit, overthrowing, trying too hard. He walked Halter. He had a three-run lead in the sixth, and he walked two batters to start an inning. He felt he was overstriding, felt his mechanics falling apart, ''and I just didn't make the adjustment,'' Pettitte said.</p>
        <p>Bobby Higginson hit a ground-ball single, driving home one run, before Pettitte struck out Dean Palmer and Wendell Magee; just one more out, and the Yankees would survive with a 3-1 lead. But Deivi Cruz singled to left, where Felix Jose, making his third start of the season, charged the ball. ''I was trying to throw the guy out at home, and I didn't have a chance,'' Jose said.</p>
        <p>Rather than glove the ball and throw home, Jose fumbled Cruz's hit, then hurled the ball toward home plate, rather than second base. Halter scored on the hit, Higginson took third on Jose's error, and Cruz rambled into second on the poorly directed throw. Two runs in, two runners in scoring position.</p>
        <p>Pettitte tried jamming Juan Encarnacion with a cut fastball but missed his target -- the ball was too far over the plate -- and Encarnacion laced a single through the middle, two runs scoring. As the inning ended, one batter later, Pettitte removed his hat, wiped his brow and spat on the ground disgustedly.</p>
        <p>There would be no reprieve. Chuck Knoblauch doubled leading off the seventh, and following that hit, Derek Jeter tried to roll the ball to the right side of the field -- and hit a soft, harmless lineout instead, failing to advance the runner. Knoblauch never made it past third. The Yankees had runners at first and second and one out in the ninth and Paul O'Neill smacked a hard grounder off Detroit's closer, Todd Jones, but right to the second baseman, Easley, who started a game-ending double play.</p>
        <p>O'Neill ran through the bag, turned and headed for the Yankees' dugout on the first-base side of the field, head down, the realization of defeat sinking in. ''This is a game that you've got to win,'' Pettitte said. ''The two walks led to it all.'' O'Neill said: ''This is a game where you look back and you'll think we definitely should have won.''</p>
        <p>The search for the perfect lineup continues, even after the acquisitions of Justice and the left-handed pitcher Denny Neagle. The Yankees' front office is seeking a right-handed power hitter to bat eighth and play left field -- those are the specifications for someone like Rondell White of the Montreal Expos -- and may swap a top prospect in return. The current craving is for another big hitter, the thinking being that if only they could get another star, perhaps that would put them over the top.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps the players already in pinstripes must start performing consistently. Perhaps they need to win games like the game they gave away yesterday.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>ORLANDO HERNANDEZ had another series of tests on his right elbow in Tampa, Fla., and the diagnosis of Dr. ALAN MILLER matched two prior opinions: Hernandez has mild inflammation in his elbow and no ligament damage. Hernandez will have tests in an attempt to determine the source of his back spasms. . . . After ROGER CLEMENS won a fourth consecutive decision on Wednesday, Manager JOE TORRE suggested the team's principal owner, GEORGE STEINBRENNER, might have played a role in Clemens's turnaround; Steinbrenner prodded Clemens about his struggles while Clemens was on the disabled list in June. ''I know what I said and Roger knows what I said, but I'm not going to talk about it,'' Steinbrenner said yesterday. ''That's between Roger and I.''</p>
