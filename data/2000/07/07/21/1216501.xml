        <p>OUT near the ninth green of the Old Course, an elderly Scot suddenly shook his head and asked, ''Why are there so many people?''</p>
        <p>''Tiger Woods,'' he was told, ''is in the next group.''</p>
        <p>But because the 24-year-old United States Open champion had made eight quiet pars, all those people following him had not made much noise. The Scots never do. Tom Weiskopf, who won the 1973 British Open at Troon, once assumed that his blind shot at a Scottish course would be close to the hole, but when he and Jack Nicklaus arrived at the green, his ball was nowhere to be seen.</p>
        <p>''Here it is,'' Nicklaus finally said. ''In the cup.''</p>
        <p>On his way off the green, Weiskopf looked over at the gallery of Scots and asked, ''Did anyone see the ball go in?''</p>
        <p>''Oh, yes,'' he was told.</p>
        <p>''Why didn't you clap?''</p>
        <p>''It's a practice round.''</p>
        <p>And as Woods shot a five-under-par 67 in yesterday's opening round of the 126th British Open, the Scots were equally discerning. It was as if they were examining a new high-tech timepiece to learn what makes it tick.</p>
        <p>Some stopped at the concession stands to munch fish and chips, chicken and chips, burgers, sausages and sandwiches while drinking soda (''That's one fifty, love,'' the woman behind the counter said) and McEwan's Export ale, advertised as ''the perfect round.'' But mostly they were quietly studying the golfer in the black cap, gray shirt, black vest, black slacks and black shoes who has changed the game that Scottish pros brought to America a century ago. In particular, the Scots were studying how Woods would adapt to the nuances of seaside-links golf, especially at the Old Course, with its steep-walled bunkers. But yesterday, he was never in a bunker.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, as Woods's pitching-wedge shot spun to within 12 feet of the cup on the 352-yard ninth hole, the applause was firmer. When he made the putt for his first birdie, he was accorded a quick burst of applause that resembled the weather -- sunny and warm. ''All right, Tiger,'' someone even yelled. If he had made that birdie at the Masters, the roar would have shaken Augusta National's cathedral pines.</p>
        <p>If he had made that birdie at the recent United States Open at Pebble Beach, the roar would have rolled across Carmel Bay like the surf.</p>
        <p>At the Old Course at St. Andrews yesterday, the only roar was when Royal Air Force fighter jets took off from the Leuchers air base across the Firth of Tay. But even without American sound effects, that first birdie seemed to energize Tiger Woods. On his way to the 10th tee, he had a quicker spring in his step. He hadn't used his driver since the sixth tee but now he crushed a tee shot that rolled across the hard, fast fairway to within a few yards of the huge green on the 379-yard hole and prompted an ''ooooh'' from the gallery. And when his 50-yard putt stopped about 10 feet from the cup, he earned a burst of applause.</p>
        <p>''They understood and appreciated that it was a good putt,'' he said later. ''They know.''</p>
        <p>The Scots also seemed to know that Woods was on the move now. After a par at the 174-yard 11th, he birdied the 314-yard 12th with a driver and two putts. Counting his par at the 175-yard eighth, he suddenly had five consecutive 3's.</p>
        <p>After another 300-yard drive on the 14th, he surveyed the Hell Bunker, where Jack Nicklaus took five shots to get out en route to a 10 in the 1995 Open, and where an American tourist once turned to his Scottish caddie.</p>
        <p>''Can I carry that Hell Bunker?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>''I doubt it, sir. It probably weighs 20 tons.''</p>
        <p>Woods carried those 20 tons. He pounded a 3-wood onto the green and two-putted for another birdie. At the 456-yard 15th, a driver and a 9-iron to 10 feet created his fifth birdie. But with people peering out of the windows of the Old Course Hotel, a pulled 3-wood off the tee on the 17th, the dreaded Road Hole, preceded his best shot of the round -- a slashed 160-yard escape from the heather.</p>
        <p>''I was trying to hit it hard with my right hand, then again hold on with my left,'' he explained later. ''You have to open up the face because you know the grass is not going to grab the clubhead, it's going to grab the shaft. That's the trick to it. You need to hit it hard and hold on so you don't flip it. It was a delicate balance I was trying to find.''</p>
        <p>When his ball soared to just short of the green and when he putted to within a foot to save par, the Scots understood and appreciated what he had done. They even applauded.</p>
