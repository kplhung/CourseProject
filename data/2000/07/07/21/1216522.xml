        <p>Addressing a longstanding debate among scientists over how much of the brain is activated to perform a difficult task like taking an I.Q. test, researchers have found that a surprisingly small and specific region of gray matter may be the brain's master problem solver.</p>
        <p>The results suggest that the venerable ''seat of human intelligence'' is less of a throne in dimensions than a footstool.</p>
        <p>Dr. John Duncan of the Cognition and Brain Science Unit of the Medical Research Council in Cambridge, England, and his colleagues report in today's issue of the journal Science their brain imaging studies of people who were asked to solve I.Q.-type questions, including spatial problems that required looking at four geometric images on a display monitor and trying to figure out which did not fit with the others; and verbal tasks that involved finding a pattern to complex sequences of letters.</p>
        <p>The scientists wondered whether large areas of the brain would light up on their scans as the subjects sweated and figuratively gnawed on their No. 2 pencils, or whether a limited locus of the brain would be the intellect's central headquarters.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, the same confined region was activated whether the subjects were tackling verbal or spatial problems. The region in question, called the lateral prefrontal cortex, comes in pairs, one for each hemisphere of the brain. It is somewhat above the outer edge of the eyebrow, and corresponds roughly to where someone would rest his head in the palm of the hand when cogitating or daydreaming. This is the same region of the brain that previous neuroimaging studies had shown to be important for solving novel tasks, keeping many things in mind at once, and screening out irrelevant information.</p>
        <p>''What we're seeing here seems to be a global workspace for organizing and coordinating information and carrying it back to other parts of the brain as needed,'' Dr. Duncan said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>It is the relative performance of this cerebral workspace, he said, that intelligence tests appear to measure, and that determines how deft a person is at solving a broad  range of cognitive problems.</p>
        <p>''Some people are blessed with a workspace that functions very, very well,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, he and his colleagues see this region of the brain as so crucial to high-level thinking that they boldly titled their report ''A Neural Basis for General Intelligence.'' However, their neuroimaging studies do not answer incendiary questions like whether current standardized tests ''really'' measure intelligence, or are culturally or otherwise biased.  Nor does the research say anything about whether the performance of the lateral prefrontal cortex is largely innate, or is heavily influenced by learning and experience.</p>
        <p>Dr. Duncan and his co-workers have yet to see if there are detectable differences in the response of the lateral prefrontal cortex in people who tend to score high on standardized tests versus those who do not.</p>
        <p>''It would be a misinterpretation of this paper to say, 'There's a genius spot in the brain,' '' said Dr. Marie T. Banich, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Dr. Robert J. Sternberg, a psychologist at Yale University who wrote a ''Perspectives'' essay to accompany the new study, said in an interview: ''This is a very narrow view of intelligence. Many psychologists are obsessed with I.Q.-type tests, but such tests don't tell you who is going to be successful in life and who isn't.'' He pointed out in his Perspectives piece that Vice President Al Gore, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and former Senator Bill Bradley all scored just middling-well on the verbal portion of the College Boards, yet all, he said, would be considered exceptionally successful Americans.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, many neuroscientists said they were impressed with the Duncan study.</p>
        <p>''It's an intriguing study,'' said Dr. Jonathan D. Cohen, a professor of psychology and director of the Center for the Study of Brain, Mind and Behavior at Princeton University. ''Duncan asks the question, is there some kind of underlying common mechanism that is 'intelligence,' or is intelligence a fractionable set of cognitive processes that differ according to different skills, domains, or talents.</p>
        <p>''What he found was very similar brain areas were engaged in what appear to be very different problem-solving tasks,'' Dr. Cohen said. ''This draws our attention to a relatively well-defined area over the vast expanse of the brain.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Duncan's research specifically tested two hoary and competing hypotheses of general intelligence by two British psychologists. One, formulated by Charles Spearman in the early 1900's, proposed that there was a general factor, dubbed the ''g-factor,'' that allowed a person to perform well in a diverse array of cognitive tests. Alternatively, Godfrey Thomson suggested that any difficult cognitive task required the contribution of multiple ''information-processors'' in the brain. The Duncan team tested 60 participants ages 29 to 51 on a range of tasks, some requiring intensive problem-solving skills -- the I.Q. test questions -- others simpler in nature. As they worked, the subjects' brains were scanned with positron emission tomography, or PET scan devices. Such scanning technology is considered an older method of neuroimaging than the currently fashionable fast magnetic resonance imaging technique, but Dr. Duncan said that the studies were begun before the advent of fast M.R.I., and that their future research, including efforts to detect differences in the lateral prefrontal cortex between high-I.Q. and low-I.Q. subjects, will be based on M.R.I. scans. Neural scans measure relative blood flow in the brain, an indication of how vigorously a region is being recruited into action.</p>
        <p>Dr. Duncan admits that he anticipated the Spearman hypothesis would be borne out by neural imaging, and that therefore he was not terribly surprised by his results.</p>
        <p>''You can say I was prejudiced,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the case of the spatial problems, the lateral prefrontal cortex was activated in both hemispheres of the brain, whereas for verbal problems, only the left kicked in. Scientists cannot say whether this reflects the fact that verbal ability is thought to be mostly left-hemispheric in nature, or because the average person has an easier time thinking verbally than spatially and therefore needs to use only half the cortical energy to attack the verbal challenge. Additionally, the spatial problems recruited some spots of the brain thought to be involved in visual analysis.</p>
        <p>Neuroscientists said the most striking result is the activation of the same patch of the left hemisphere lateral prefrontal cortex for both verbal and spatial tasks.</p>
        <p>''What's most important is that you see very nice convergence in this area for two different types of problems,'' said Dr. Banich.</p>
        <p>The results lend weight to the idea that the brain is modular in its construction, built of various regions or loci that carry out highly specialized functions, such as recognizing faces or large landmarks in the environment, or categorizing apples and grapes as fruits. At the same time, the lateral prefrontal cortex appears to be a master integrator of tasks and input -- a cognitive lumper rather than a splitter, as it were.</p>
        <p>''The lateral prefrontal cortex is a region that receives a lot of converging information, both external and internal,'' said Dr. Earl K. Miller, a professor of neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''It's the most well-connected part of the brain. If there is going to be a general mechanism for intelligence, you'd expect it to be in a region where a lot of information converges.''</p>
        <p>Neuroscientists also emphasize that, despite its modularity, the brain is extremely plastic and dynamic.</p>
        <p>''The brain is very responsive to experience,'' said Dr. William T. Greenough, a neuroscientist at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. ''It is an ever-changing place.''</p>
