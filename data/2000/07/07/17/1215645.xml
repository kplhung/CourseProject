        <p>Republicans in the House plan to begin a push this week to roll back a tax imposed in 1993 on the Social Security benefits received by the roughly one-fifth of retired people with the highest incomes.</p>
        <p>Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said he intended to pass the bill in the committee on Wednesday and have it ready for consideration on the House floor before Congress recessed at the end of the month.</p>
        <p>The bill would repeal an element of the 1993 plan to reduce the budget deficit that was developed by President Clinton and passed by Congress in the face of opposition from Republicans.</p>
        <p>The 1993 measure increased to 85 percent, from 50 percent, the portion of Social Security benefits subject to income tax when a retiree's income, including half of his or her annual Social Security benefit, exceeds certain levels. Those levels are $34,000 for a single person and $44,000 for a married couple.</p>
        <p>Mr. Archer's bill would reduce the portion of benefits that could be taxed to 50 percent, although at that level the tax kicks in at lower income thresholds -- $25,000 for a single person and $32,000 for a couple filing a joint return.</p>
        <p>Mr. Archer said there was no longer any reason for the tax to apply to 85 percent of benefits, since the budget deficit it was intended to help eradicate had now turned to surplus. And he said it was unfair to tax benefits that workers had contributed toward throughout their lives.</p>
        <p>''When Clinton did this, it was money grubbing on the basis of getting the deficit down,'' Mr. Archer said in an interview on Friday. ''We have no deficit anymore. We have bigger and bigger surpluses, and now is the time to right this wrong.''</p>
        <p>The bill is the latest example of the Republican strategy this year of breaking its big tax-cutting package into small pieces that can be debated on their own and not immediately dismissed by Democrats as fiscally irresponsible.</p>
        <p>In the coming week alone, the Senate is expected to pass a tax cut for married couples, and the House will probably take up and pass a bill allowing bigger contributions to individual retirement accounts and 401(k) retirement plans.</p>
        <p>The prospects of Mr. Archer's Social Security tax bill becoming law this year are uncertain. The measure is supported by most Republicans and a few Democrats in the Senate.</p>
        <p>A number of Democrats in the House, including Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, have supported repeal of the tax, saying that retirees should not have to shoulder the burden of dealing with the nation's fiscal problems. With the projected federal budget surplus rising, Democrats have increasingly joined Republicans in supporting election year tax cuts.</p>
        <p>But White House officials said the administration would oppose the bill. Because the revenue produced by the tax, a projected $8.8 billion next year, goes to the Medicare system of health insurance for the elderly and disabled, repealing the tax would require using other general revenue to shore up Medicare at a time when the system's long-term financial outlook is troubled, the administration officials said.</p>
        <p>Moreover, they said, the tax cut would go to a relatively well-off group without doing anything for lower income people.</p>
        <p>An analysis of the issue last week by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, concluded that repealing the 1993 measure could ultimately put Medicare's financial health at risk. The center said repealing the measure would be unwarranted because it did nothing more than ''make the tax treatment of Social Security comparable to that of private pensions'' for the beneficiaries it affected, who are about 22 percent of all Social Security recipients.</p>
        <p>Mr. Archer said Medicare would not be affected because the budget surplus would allow additional general tax revenues to go to Medicare in place of the revenue lost from repeal of the tax. He suggested that Republicans were ready to make the debate an issue in the election, noting that it was Vice President Al Gore who had cast the deciding vote, in his role as tiebreaker in the Senate, to implement Mr. Clinton's 1993 budget plan.</p>
