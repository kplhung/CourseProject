        <p>Regina Jacobs and Suzy Favor Hamilton relied on tactics rather than record speed today in the women's 1,500 meters at the Olympic trials. When Jacobs put the accelerator down in the final lap, there was no one who could beat her to the checkered flag.

        <p>Regina Jacobs and Suzy Favor Hamilton relied on tactics rather than record speed today in the women's 1,500 meters at the Olympic trials. When Jacobs put the accelerator down in the final lap, there was no one who could beat her to the checkered flag. But just as impressive as her victory in 4 minutes 1.01 seconds was the third-place finish by Marla Runyan, who became the first legally blind American athlete ever to qualify for the Winter or Summer Games.</p>
        <p>Michael Johnson won the 400 meters by nearly a second in 43.68 seconds, the 10th-fastest time ever, but this was the rare occasion when he became a footnote to the day's events. The real drama occurred in the women's 1,500, where two longtime rivals, Jacobs and Favor Hamilton, finished first and second, and Runyan made her run for third.</p>
        <p>Runyan has Stargardt's disease, a degeneration of the retina that began to affect her in childhood and has essentially left her with a hole at the center of her vision. She can see the track with her peripheral vision, but her competitors are often no more than smudges of color and fuzzy hair styles. She has 20-300 vision in one eye, and 20-400 in the other. She must use magnifying devices to read. To watch videotapes of her races, she must be only inches from the television.</p>
        <p>In early June, her vision impairment led to an injury while training in Eugene, Ore. Runyan jumped out of the way to avoid a youngster on a bike on a running trail, and she twisted her left leg, injuring the ilio-tibial band of tissue that runs from the hip to the knee. She could not run on a track or a trail for five weeks, running in a pool instead, and it was not until last Saturday that she began to train again on dry land. Exhausted, she began dry-heaving after Friday's preliminary round and limped off the track in a way that seemed to suggest she had no chance of making the Olympic team.</p>
        <p>However, she is one of the country's most versatile and resourceful athletes, having competed in the heptathlon at the 1996 Olympic trials. After the Atlanta Games, she decided to concentrate on running, finishing 10th in the 1,500 meters at the 1999 world championships in Seville, Spain. She received treatment on her leg before stepping on the track today, and even though she was in pain, she positioned herself smartly for a final sprint to the tape.</p>
        <p>''It's awesome,'' Runyan said of making the Olympic team. ''I never really think of my vision as much as the media does. And I don't think my competitors do, either. I think my vision is just a circumstance that happened. I never looked at it as a barrier. I never said I wanted to be the first legally blind Olympian. I just wanted to be on an Olympic team, me, Marla.''</p>
        <p>But, Runyan added, she had received a lot of encouraging mail as her story has become public and her running career has ascended.</p>
        <p>''It makes me feel really good that it affects people in a positive way,'' Runyan said.</p>
        <p>The men's 1,500 meters was won by the eccentric collegiate champion from Stanford, Gabe Jennings, who made a break with 550 meters to go to set a personal best in 3:35.90. Jason Pyrah took second in 3:36.70 and Jennings's Stanford teammate Michael Stember finished third in 3:37.04, but must make the Olympic qualifying standard of 3:37 to compete in Sydney.</p>
        <p>Jennings grew up without electricity on a commune in Northern California and never saw the Summer Games on television until four years ago.</p>
        <p>As the women's 1,500 began, Jacobs and Favor Hamilton dropped to the back of the pack to avoid any early congestion, then both moved up easily to the middle of the field. Runyan hung back on the outside so that her legs would not become entangled. Jacobs, a two-time bronze medalist at the world championships, and Favor Hamilton, the only American woman other than Mary Slaney to run under 4 minutes, went through 400 meters in 67 seconds and the 800 in 2:13.8. The two were never more than a stride apart, and Jacobs controlled the race from just off of Favor Hamilton's shoulder.</p>
        <p>Runyan almost experienced disaster on the third lap when chain-reaction bumping forced her to reach out and touch the back of Shayne Culpepper to maintain her own balance.</p>
        <p>Favor Hamilton made a charge heading into the bell lap, but Jacobs easily followed and began a fierce kick that took her around the final lap in 57.6 seconds.</p>
        <p>Hamilton sprinted desperately but could never make up any ground, and had to settle for second in 4:01.81. Runyan began her kick with 200 meters left and held off Culpepper to take third in 4:06.44.</p>
        <p>''Coming off the last turn, I shifted gears and tried to hold it to the finish,'' Runyan said. ''I began to tighten up, but I hoped I was able to hold them off.''</p>
        <p>Slaney's 17-year-old national record of 3:57.12 will stand for at least another season. However, Jacobs and Favor Hamilton are expected to challenge for a gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>''In terms of strategy, it looked like Suzy and I had both the same idea,'' Jacobs said. ''The race really started to go with a lap to go. That's where I wanted to start winding it up. If I can run a strategic 4:01, that tells me I have a lot of fitness and am in position to run a very fast sub-4 if I get the opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Favor Hamilton, who missed last season after surgery on her Achilles' tendon, said she had just begun her speed work and was encouraged because the Olympics were in September this year instead of earlier in the summer.</p>
        <p>''I'm pretty excited because the race felt easy to me,'' she said. ''I just need to work a little bit more on my sprinting, which is easy to do.''</p>
