        <p>Out on the campaign trail, Gov. George W. Bush appears to be barely breaking a sweat these days.</p>
        <p>Town hall meetings where large audiences are free to ask questions vanished months ago when Senator John McCain of Arizona, a master of spontaneity, disappeared from the presidential race. Now audiences rarely get to ask Mr. Bush anything.</p>
        <p>On many days the governor makes no more than one or two public appearances, and occasionally they last no more than 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's signature campaign events are small panel discussions that more resemble seminars on social services. Ostensibly, the sessions are about new policy proposals. But Mr. Bush's aides say they are just as much about mood, emotion and image. As the once troubled teenagers and single mothers who make up the panels tell Mr. Bush how they have overcome hardship, he responds with emotive language, words and phrases like ''love'' or  ''loving family'' or ''willing heart.''</p>
        <p>The style and schedule that Mr. Bush is keeping is deliberate, reflecting the campaign's strategic confidence that he can mold his image by carefully choreographing television images in battleground states.</p>
        <p>In an era in which voters are more and more turned off by partisanship, the events make him seem to be governing rather than campaigning.</p>
        <p>It is almost as if he is running a modified version of an incumbent's  Rose Garden strategy, only he is not the incumbent, and the Rose Garden is not at the White House but in a handful of swing states.</p>
        <p>That is not to say that Mr. Bush is not working hard. His days are filled with fund-raisers, policy meetings and interviews with reporters. He is putting the last touches on his convention speech, and is in the final phase of choosing a running mate.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Bush's style could not be more different from that of his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, who is generally running behind in the polls and has longer, more event-packed campaign days. Mr. Gore takes question after question from larger audiences, showing off a detailed knowledge of subjects like immigration law and the history of Medicare.</p>
        <p>But while the presidential race is only now moving into the critical convention period, Mr. Bush and his aides say his method of campaigning has produced good results. It has put him ahead in many crucial states and made him competitive in ones the Democrats had counted on.</p>
        <p>At Bush headquarters in Austin, Tex., the staff keeps a blue and red color-coded electoral map that shows which way each state is leaning. Bush aides right now have a panorama showing Mr. Bush leading in states that are worth a combined 345 electoral votes and Mr. Gore leading in states worth a combined 92 electoral votes. The map shows states representing 101 electoral votes up for grabs. A candidate needs 270 to win the presidency.</p>
        <p>''The good news is I'm leading some of the polls,'' Mr. Bush told state Republican officials gathered in Austin last week. ''The bad news is the election isn't tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>So confident are the Republicans that after running about $5 million in advertisements promoting Mr. Bush's Social Security proposals, they let the Democrats spend about $14 million in key states on commercials promoting Mr. Gore and Democratic issues without responding.</p>
        <p>''The race stayed the same,'' one Bush adviser said. The Republican Party is readying a new advertising campaign to lead into the Republican National Convention in two weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides attribute the state of the presidential race partly to a series of missteps by Mr. Gore over a rocky spring. But they also point to Mr. Bush's turn to a policy-oriented campaign style after the primaries ended. That was when he needed to erase the bitterness of his fight with Senator McCain and soften the hard conservative edges he had created for himself.</p>
        <p>The Texas governor says he knew from the start that he wanted to campaign this way, much as he did in his first governor's race, in 1994. At that time he stuck to four issues with relentless repetition: juvenile crime, welfare overhaul, education and an overhaul of the legal system.</p>
        <p>''Candidates tend to repeat the successes of the past,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I found that ideas do drive campaigns.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is using the same phrases he did more than a year ago, that he is a ''compassionate conservative,'' that he wants to fight the ''soft bigotry of low expectations'' for minority students in public schools, that he wants to rally ''the armies of compassion.''</p>
        <p>He says he does not get bored by the repetition: ''I view it as an opportunity. What a good candidate has to understand is every minute is an opportunity to convey a message.''</p>
        <p>But he has used policy proposals to give himself and his themes more definition, showing how he is a traditional Republican and how he is not.</p>
        <p>The groundwork for the policy offensive was set more than a year ago. Mr. Bush named three senior advisers for policy: Lawrence B. Lindsey for the economy, Stephen Goldsmith for domestic affairs and Condoleezza Rice for national security. He also assembled a large think tank under the leadership of Josh Bolten, who had worked in the administration of Mr. Bush's father.</p>
        <p>But the final plan for policy proposals leading into the convention was put together by the campaign  staff just as the primaries were coming to a close in early March.</p>
        <p>The first speeches on education and health care and the environment put Mr. Bush squarely on Democratic turf with reading programs for poor areas and tax credits to help people who lack health insurance.</p>
        <p>Then came broad proposals to reshape Social Security and rethink nuclear policy. They skipped all of the devilish details. But Mr. Bush's aides say they showed voters that Mr. Bush was willing to take risks.</p>
        <p>Lately, he seems to be unveiling policies for every line item of the federal budget, an additional $75 million across five years for veterans mentoring, for example, or $400 million for after-school programs.</p>
        <p>These latest proposals may seem small, but aides say Mr. Bush is using the ideas to shape his image. In a year in which no issue is dominating, a Bush adviser said, ''issues are important but they are important as reflections of broader values and keys into a candidate's leadership.'' He said independent swing voters ''are not taking their stands on individual issues, but their feelings about what values the candidate reflects.''</p>
        <p>Normally, a result is that in swing state after swing state, evening news programs show Mr. Bush surrounded by winsome minority children or troubled teenagers or poor-but-determined single mothers talking of hopes for building a better life. Only rarely is the script interrupted the way it was on Friday in New Jersey when a minister challenged Mr. Bush about the death penalty.</p>
        <p>The dynamics of the presidential race could well change by the fall. Mr. Gore's aides say that a vice president traditionally does not come out from under the shadow of the president until the party convention. And they argue that the public still favors Democratic positions on issues, that Mr. Gore is better under pressure and that he will shine when the candidates meet in debates.</p>
        <p>The governor promised today that he would not lie back and let Mr. Gore criticize his positions and his Texas record. ''I'm a good counterpuncher,'' he said on the ABC program ''This Week.'' ''I am.''</p>
