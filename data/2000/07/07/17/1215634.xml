        <p>Dr. Dre, the producer and rapper who made gangsta rap an enduring commercial force, has put his testosterone fantasies onstage with the Up in Smoke tour, which came to the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., on Saturday night and is due at Nassau Coliseum on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The tour features the multimillion-selling rappers Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Ice Cube along with Dr. Dre, and it is one of hip-hop's most elaborate spectacles to date. The East Rutherford show moved efficiently through a nearly four-hour production involving multiple backdrops, blasts of flame, video clips, a giant talking skull and a purple low-rider convertible. A comedian, Alex Taylor, worked the crowd during set changes.</p>

        <p>Dr. Dre, the producer and rapper who made gangsta rap an enduring commercial force, has put his testosterone fantasies onstage with the Up in Smoke tour, which came to the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., on Saturday night and is due at Nassau Coliseum on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The tour features the multimillion-selling rappers Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Ice Cube along with Dr. Dre, and it is one of hip-hop's most elaborate spectacles to date. The East Rutherford show moved efficiently through a nearly four-hour production involving multiple backdrops, blasts of flame, video clips, a giant talking skull and a purple low-rider convertible. A comedian, Alex Taylor, worked the crowd during set changes.</p>
        <p>Although Eminem is the performer on the tour with the best-selling current album, ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' (Aftermath/ Interscope) and has become pop's latest scourge of Western civilization, his half-hour set arrives midway through the concert, placing him among Dr. Dre's proteges old and new. The lineup also included short sets by the Eastsidaz and Warren G. The concert hails Dr. Dre as an expert at creating lean, springy grooves, as a rap talent scout and as a packager of vicious attitudes in lighthearted form.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dre's turf is a man's world, loosely based on the way gang members in the crack trade lived fast and died young in South-Central Los Angeles. Fellow men are male-bonded allies, potentially deadly competitors or enemy cops. Women are mere trophies, expected to serve sexual needs and disappear for their own good.</p>
        <p>Rappers were spinning tales of crime and sex before N.W.A. -- the group Dr. Dre founded with Ice Cube, Ren, Eazy-E and others in the mid-1980's -- released its first album in 1989. But N.W.A. eased away from grim realism. While Ice Cube made political points about police brutality and crime as entrepreneurship, N.W.A.'s other rappers were more fascinated by what ill-gotten gains could procure: a life of luxury, brief as it might be, with booze, marijuana and women for the taking.</p>
        <p>After N.W.A. disbanded, Dr. Dre's 1992 album, ''The Chronic'' (Interscope), and the album he produced for Snoop Doggy Dogg in 1993, ''Doggystyle'' (Death Row/Interscope), made the gangsta life sound like a party occasionally interrupted by gunplay. Dr. Dre's calm baritone declamation and Snoop Doggy Dogg's casually syncopated drawl worked with Dr. Dre's low-slung grooves to sound more dissolute than desperate. The songs were smoother and simpler than East Coast rap, and they decisively expanded the hip-hop audience into the suburbs.</p>
        <p>Now, Dr. Dre is claiming his rightful credit and flaunting his longevity in contrast with the short careers of most hip-hop hitmakers. His set was a men's night out, shared with Snoop Dogg, Eminem (who pledged his loyalty to Dr. Dre in ''What's the Difference'' and ''Forgot About Dre''), Ice Cube (who also had his own set), Xzibit, Nate Dogg, Devin and others. An opening video covered the bases of gangsta machismo: it showed Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg enjoying the favors of groupies, going out for marijuana and then shooting robbers at a liquor store, clearly no longer identifying with small-time thugs.</p>
        <p>From there it was a 1990's retrospective: some anti-cop invective, some threats to rivals, a touch of aging-star defensiveness (''I still got love for the streets'') and a lot of lifestyle boasting, from Snoop Dogg's ''Gin and Juice'' to Dr. Dre's ''XXplosive.'' It arrived with the unhurried, swaggering beats and succinct melodic hooks that make Dr. Dre's songs comfortable and catchy, savoring the cliches they went a long way toward creating. The only letdown was a touted reunion of N.W.A., with MC Ren, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg in place of the late Eazy-E. They performed only one song, the new ''Chin Check,'' although their gangsta-rap cornerstones would have thrilled the crowd.</p>
        <p>Eminem was incongruous among Dr. Dre's circle, not because he was the only white performer, but because he's no joiner. Marshall Mathers, who calls himself Eminem, frames himself as a psychopathic loner, lashing out at everyone, especially himself. His rapping has hugely improved in a year of touring as he has added rhythm to his speedy articulation, while Dr. Dre's music and production set Eminem's sneer in trim, bouncy settings that sound amiably comic.</p>
        <p>Both as his evil alter ego, Slim Shady, and as Marshall Mathers, Eminem encouraged listeners to raise their middle fingers and to be ''proud to be out of your mind and out of control.'' He insulted his mother, his wife, the media, teenypop stars, people who wonder if he's sincere and a Detroit rap group, the Insane Clown Posse. He said he hated his own hit ''My Name Is,'' vowed to murder various people and slung homophobic epithets with particular vitriol. He's hyperbolically funny, with undertones of cruelty and confusion. And he feeds on shock, leaving listeners to decide when he's joking. Yet unlike the self-satisfied gangsta rappers sharing the bill, he clearly put his nastiest ideas in the mouth of a character no sane person would emulate.</p>
