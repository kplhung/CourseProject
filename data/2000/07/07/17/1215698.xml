        <p>Few ethnic conflicts in the world are more savage than the war in Sri Lanka, an island nation off the southern tip of India.

The fighting has so resisted outside efforts to mediate that Michael Ondaatje, in his powerful new novel ''Anil's Ghost,'' refers to it as ''a Hundred Years' War with modern weaponry.''

With covert help from India in the 1980's, a Tamil insurgency seeking independence in the north and east made extensive military gains.

        <p>Few ethnic conflicts in the world are more savage than the war in Sri Lanka, an island nation off the southern tip of India. Since 1983, more than 60,000 people have died, many times the number killed in Northern Ireland. The fighting has so resisted outside efforts to mediate that Michael Ondaatje, in his powerful new novel ''Anil's Ghost,'' refers to it as ''a Hundred Years' War with modern weaponry.'' Since the spring, the war has heated up again with an anti-government offensive by separatist Tamils in Sri Lanka's north. But there has also been a positive development. The United States, India and other countries are increasingly united in trying to bring an end to the fighting.</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, Sri Lanka was often hailed as a model of stability, democracy and economic progress in the third world. But for many decades, Sri Lanka's Tamil minority bristled under discriminatory policies of the government in Colombo, which is dominated by the ethnic Sinhalese majority. With covert help from India in the 1980's, a Tamil insurgency seeking independence in the north and east made extensive military gains. India came to its senses and kicked the Tamil rebels off Indian soil and sent its own troops to Sri Lanka. The troops were later withdrawn, but Tamil rebels retaliated by murdering former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.</p>
        <p>The northern city of Jaffna, once captured by the rebels, is controlled again by the government, but in the last two months 30,000 government troops have been besieged by the new Tamil offensive. The obvious way to stop the fighting would be to establish some sort of federation on Sri Lanka, with autonomy for Tamil areas. The government has accepted the idea but not gone far enough in its devolution proposals. Tamil rebels cling to their goal of independence. Moreover, the main rebel group, known as the Tigers, has killed off and wiped out rival moderate groups.</p>
        <p>A mediation attempt by Norway made some progress earlier this year, but the offensive by the Tigers has put the possibility of talks on hold. One good sign is that President Chandrika Kumaratunga of Sri Lanka has been working with the main opposition party to agree on a set of new Tamil autonomy proposals. These need to be fleshed out, but the unity attempt is a step forward.</p>
        <p>It may not be possible to restart the negotiating process until it is clear who will control Jaffna and the surrounding peninsula in the north. But all sides should recognize that there can be no military solution to Sri Lanka's troubles. The terror, assassinations and army clashes have gone on so long that, as Mr. Ondaatje writes, the original reasons have been all but forgotten.</p>
