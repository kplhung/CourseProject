        <p>Re ''How Race Is Lived in America'':</p>
        <p>There is a large population of mixed-race people in the United States, and our numbers are steadily growing. It seems unfair that we are labeled as either belonging to one group or another when the fact is that we don't.</p>
        <p>It's a special culture, and we may be the group with the fewest biases and preconceived notions about how other people ''are.'' If nothing else, looking at how some mixed-race people identify more with one race  than with another provides an interesting glimpse into how social opinions about race issues are formed.</p>
