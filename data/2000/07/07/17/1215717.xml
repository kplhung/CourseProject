        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your series ''How Race Is Lived in America'' comes at a critical time in America's assessment of its place in history. Many Americans falsely believe that after generations of injustice, this country is now a fair place when it comes to race. We marched in the 1960's. We made a difference.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your series ''How Race Is Lived in America'' comes at a critical time in America's assessment of its place in history. Many Americans falsely believe that after generations of injustice, this country is now a fair place when it comes to race. We marched in the 1960's. We made a difference.</p>
        <p>No, we cannot stop marching now.  The current economic prosperity has lulled many Americans, black and white, into complacency about America's debilitating but solvable problem: racism.</p>
        <p>We should stand up for zero tolerance of racism and set an example for the rest of the world to emulate.  Until we do this, politicians have no right to applaud this country as the greatest power on earth.</p>
