        <p>Editorial criticizes Giuliani administration decision to appeal of decision by Justice Richard Braun that New York City is obliged to help mentally ill prisoners in city jails obtain continuing treatment when they are released</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Justice Richard Braun of the New York State Supreme Court ruled last week that New York City was obliged to help mentally ill prisoners in the city jails obtain continuing treatment when they are released. The Giuliani administration is expected to appeal the decision, but doing so would be a waste of time and resources. The city should instead be devoting its energies to making sure that these inmates get the help they desperately need.</p>
        <p>Every year, some 25,000 mentally ill individuals go through the New York City jails. While in jail, these prisoners are treated with psychotropic medication and therapy. The most severely ill inmates are housed in special units or in the psychiatric wards of New York City hospitals. Yet when these prisoners are released, they are literally dropped off at a subway station in the middle of the night without their medications or any plan for housing or future treatment. They are given $1.50 and a couple of subway tokens and left to fend for themselves.</p>

        <p>Justice Richard Braun of the New York State Supreme Court ruled last week that New York City was obliged to help mentally ill prisoners in the city jails obtain continuing treatment when they are released. The Giuliani administration is expected to appeal the decision, but doing so would be a waste of time and resources. The city should instead be devoting its energies to making sure that these inmates get the help they desperately need.</p>
        <p>Every year, some 25,000 mentally ill individuals go through the New York City jails. While in jail, these prisoners are treated with psychotropic medication and therapy. The most severely ill inmates are housed in special units or in the psychiatric wards of New York City hospitals. Yet when these prisoners are released, they are literally dropped off at a subway station in the middle of the night without their medications or any plan for housing or future treatment. They are given $1.50 and a couple of subway tokens and left to fend for themselves.</p>
        <p>This bizarre and inhumane system subjects these prisoners to almost certain mental deterioration, which can lead directly to homelessness, more criminal conduct, rearrest and reincarceration. Some individuals have been through this cycle dozens and dozens of times, at a huge financial cost to the criminal justice system. The sickest prisoners usually end up back in jail, in a hospital emergency room or dead. The threat to public safety from such neglect is immeasurable.</p>
        <p>Last year, the Urban Justice Center brought the current lawsuit asking that the city be required to prepare individualized plans so that mentally ill inmates would get treatment and services after their release. That could mean giving inmates a supply of medication when they leave, helping them find housing and arranging Medicaid coverage for treatment.</p>
        <p>Though the judge thinks otherwise, the city argues that it has no legal obligation under state law to prepare such plans. The city may be worried about the administrative costs involved. But the cost of doing nothing is undeniably greater both socially and financially than that of helping this vulnerable population continue with treatment.</p>
