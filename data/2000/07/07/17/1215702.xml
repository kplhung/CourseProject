        <p>Along Dixwell Avenue, the four-lane commercial strip on the edge of town, there is a large wooden sign saying, ''Leaving New Haven,'' which many black drivers consider a warning. To  them it means they are entering hostile territory: the suburban, mostly white town of Hamden, and in particular, its overwhelmingly white police force.</p>
        <p>''They're notorious,'' said Darnell Goldson, the legislative assistant to New Haven's mayor, John DeStefano Jr. ''I don't like driving in Hamden, and most black folks I know don't like driving in Hamden.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldson, 39, who grew up in the historically black neighborhood of Newhallville, two blocks from the Hamden border, added, ''As soon as you get near the town line, you look around to make sure everybody's seat belt is fastened, that all the signals are working, that there's nothing they can stop you for.''</p>
        <p>Not all black residents of New Haven say Hamden police officers single them out, and some blacks in Hamden interviewed for this article said they had never felt unjustly treated by their town's police force.</p>
        <p>But among many, perhaps most, New Haven blacks, resentment of Hamden officers, who roll across the border into New hallville on routine patrol now and then, is about as old as Dixwell Avenue itself.</p>
        <p>Hamden police officials, troubled by those negative perceptions, insist that their officers treat everyone fairly, regardless of race, and point to police records showing that three-quarters of the people they arrested in 1999 were white, although that figure does not necessarily reflect the number of people detained.</p>
        <p>Three weeks ago, anger in Newhallville reached a pitch that required the calming powers of both municipalities' mayors, police chiefs and black leaders. On June 28, a black New Haven man who the police believe was driving drunk led a white Hamden  police officer on what witnesses said was a short but dangerous chase down Dixwell Avenue. Police officials said the officer followed the driver, Eric L. Anderson, 29, after he roared through a red light in Hamden, but did not chase him at high speeds. But Newhallville residents said the Hamden police should have allowed the New Haven police, whose actions they largely support, to track down Mr. Anderson.</p>
        <p>He was arrested two blocks inside the New Haven city line, after crashing his Dodge sport utility vehicle into eight cars, flipping the Dodge on its roof. Fifteen people were injured.</p>
        <p>On the crumbling sidewalks of Newhallville, a tough neighborhood of older wood-frame homes and dimly lighted storefronts less than a mile from the gothic spires of Yale University, people immediately voiced outrage. Not on behalf of Mr. Anderson, but because of what his case  represents: white police officers from other towns invading New Haven's black neighborhoods, sometimes at high speeds. And that reminds everyone of Malik Jones.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Mr. Jones, 21, of New Haven, was unarmed when he was shot to death by Robert Flodquist, a white officer from neighboring East Haven, after a high-speed car chase that ended in New Haven.  The police said that Mr. Jones, who was black, was being chased because he was driving erratically, and that Officer Flodquist had shot him because the officer had believed that he was in danger of being run over. A federal investigation cleared the officer of any criminal misconduct.</p>
        <p>But the killing prompted the General Assembly to pass a law banning  racial profiling, the police practice of stopping or questioning people because of their race. The law, which took effect in October, requires officers to record the race of drivers they stop for traffic and other violations.</p>
        <p>The law has not assuaged many black residents here. On July 1, in  response to Mr. Anderson's pursuit and crash, about 60 people marched  down Dixwell Avenue into Hamden to protest what they say is a racist disregard for their neighborhood by the town's police.</p>
        <p>''Someday, they're gonna kill one of the little kids out here,'' one Dixwell Avenue homeowner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said in  an interview last week. ''It's a race thing, that's all it is, straight up.  White cops chasing black people, all the time. You ever see a black cop  chasing white people?''</p>
        <p>The perception that the police in Connecticut -- or New York or New Jersey, for that matter -- single out blacks is nothing new.</p>
        <p>''This is an issue that we as African-Americans have experienced all of our lives,'' said Lisa M. Scails, state president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Three months ago, she said, she and her husband, Greg, who is also black, were stopped in Fairfield for traveling a mile or two per hour over the speed limit, though they were not given a ticket. ''You pull over. You go along with what they say. And then you just move on.''</p>
        <p>But in New Haven, black distrust of the Hamden police also grows out of geography. Bound by rivers and highways on three sides, New Haven shares a broad avenue, Dixwell, only with Hamden, and people can leave one and enter the other without noticing. Unless, many Newhallville residents said, you happen to be black.</p>
        <p>In more than 20 interviews conducted last week with residents in both towns, most blacks said they had been stopped at least once by a Hamden police officer without being cited for any violation.</p>
        <p>''Driving normal and decent and slow will get you stopped in Hamden if you are a black man,'' said the Rev. Scott Marks of the red-brick Varick A.M.E. Zion Church on Dixwell Avenue, the oldest black church in New Haven.</p>
        <p>The Rev. W. David Lee, the church's soft-spoken pastor, added, ''When I get into my Lexus, I have my Yale University and Syracuse stickers in the back window,'' where Hamden police officers can see them. ''Many times, that has saved me.''</p>
        <p>Others feel more vulnerable. Marcus Paca, 23, a Newhallville resident  who works in telecommunications marketing, said he had been pulled over twice in the last two years by Hamden officers but was never given a ticket. ''I'm a college graduate,'' Mr. Paca said, ''but I feel harassed, I feel threatened. I feel like every time I go into Hamden, I'm going to be pulled over, because I've seen it too many times. They treat you different than they treat white people.''</p>
        <p>In an interview Wednesday, Mayor DeStefano, who is white, acknowledged concern over the litany of stories he has heard from black New Haven residents about their treatment by the Hamden police. ''There is no doubt there is a problem,'' he said. ''I've talked with too many citizens who have too strong a feeling for it not to have some basis in fact.''</p>
        <p>But the mayor said it was no surprise that race had become an issue along Dixwell Avenue, which runs blighted and broken through New Haven and ceaselessly commercial through Hamden. ''Connecticut is one of the most segregated states by town line,'' Mr. DeStefano said.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, he and the New Haven police chief, Melvin H. Wearing, plan to meet at the church with Mr.  Lee, Mr. Marks and the Hamden police chief, Robert F. Nolan, to try to improve the Police Department's relationship with blacks in New Haven.</p>
        <p>Chief Nolan said his officers did not single out African-Americans,  and pointed out that his department began tracking the race of drivers  detained by his officers before state law required it.</p>
        <p>''Do I believe that the Hamden Police Department profiles? Absolutely not,'' Chief Nolan said in an interview last week. Of the 12,000 or so arrests made by his officers last year, he said, about 3,000 involved black suspects. And during that time, he added, members of his department, which has two black officers on a force of more than 100, ventured across the New Haven city line only seven times.</p>
        <p>''I feel strongly that the officers here in Hamden are well trained and professional,'' he said. ''If we found that any officer was profiling any individual, my opinion is that the officer should be taken off the job.''</p>
        <p>Why do New Haven blacks so uniformly distrust his officers? The chief paused, then said: ''I think the perception is what creates the problem. I don't think they have to worry about taking their chances coming into Hamden. I bet if you talk to black Hamden residents, they don't feel that way.''</p>
        <p>Adrianne Gray, a black woman who moved to Hamden from New Haven in April, said she had no problem with the police in Hamden. ''If you cooperate with them, they'll cooperate with you,'' she said. She dismissed as ''ignorant'' the common complaints she hears from New Haven blacks about the Hamden police, and pointed out that she had never been pulled over ''because I don't put myself a position for that to happen.''</p>
        <p>Asked why she moved to Hamden, Ms. Gray, whose young daughter fidgeted in her arms, shrugged. ''It's quieter,'' she said. ''It's just somewhere better to live.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 20, 2000, Thursday  An article on Monday about complaints by black New Haven residents that they are harassed by police officers from an adjacent town, Hamden, misstated the location of Avon and Simsbury, two other Connecticut towns where the New Haven residents said they had been singled out for traffic stops. It is Hartford County, not Fairfield County.</p>
