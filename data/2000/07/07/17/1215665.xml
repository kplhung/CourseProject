        <p>Third baseman Robin Ventura was placed on the disabled list after the Mets' 7-3 loss to Toronto this afternoon, and if the right-hander Rick Reed is healthy, he will be activated to start on Monday night against the Blue Jays.</p>
        <p>Ventura, who bruised his right rotator cuff while sliding on June 25, does not know if he will be back to top form when he returns. ''Nobody knows when they go on it that you're going to be perfect when you come off,'' Ventura said. ''But I'm fairly certain it's going to be better than it is right now.''</p>

        <p>Third baseman Robin Ventura was placed on the disabled list after the Mets' 7-3 loss to Toronto this afternoon, and if the right-hander Rick Reed is healthy, he will be activated to start on Monday night against the Blue Jays.</p>
        <p>Ventura, who bruised his right rotator cuff while sliding on June 25, does not know if he will be back to top form when he returns. ''Nobody knows when they go on it that you're going to be perfect when you come off,'' Ventura said. ''But I'm fairly certain it's going to be better than it is right now.''</p>
        <p>Ventura, who had a magnetic resonance imaging test on Saturday, has been unable to raise his elbow high without pain in the shoulder. He has not been on the 15-day disabled list before and he does not know what lies ahead besides exercise. ''I've never done this before,'' said Ventura, who had 6 hits in 50 at-bats after injuring the shoulder.</p>
        <p>By activating Reed, who has a broken left wrist, instead of promoting Mike Kinkade from Class AA Binghamton, the Mets would have 12 pitchers, one more than Manager Bobby Valentine prefers.</p>
