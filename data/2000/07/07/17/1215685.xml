        <p>When Erik Giovanni Rosales, 28, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala, was picked up by the Immigration and Naturalization Service in late 1997 at a factory on Long Island, he was promptly put into the pipeline to be deported.</p>
        <p>Frantic, he searched the Spanish-language papers for help. He found it in a large advertisement by Stela Sapio, who advertises herself as an immigration specialist with offices at 37-44 75th Street in Queens and 71 Franklin Street here.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Rosales's girlfriend, Marlen Jadira Martinez, 26, and her mother, Rebecca Lima, 47, who said they were at the meeting, Ms. Sapio told Mr. Rosales that she was an immigration lawyer and would represent him.</p>
        <p>But in the three meetings with I.N.S. officials at 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan that eventually led to Mr. Rosales's deportation, Ms. Sapio never appeared, despite having charged $700 up front, Ms. Martinez said. Then on the eve of Mr. Rosales's departure late last year, she said, Ms. Sapio assured him that he could get a green card if he paid her $2,400. Mr. Rosales and Ms. Martinez had grown desperate, and they got maximum advances on her credit cards to deliver the money in cash.</p>
        <p>From Washington Heights to Jersey City to Hempstead on Long Island, there are hundreds of con artists who prey on the New York region's illegal immigrants, whose ignorance of the legal system is matched only by their desperation, according to law enforcement officials. These profiteers, who often pose as lawyers, have been around for decades, adjusting their schemes as immigration laws change.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials say that once immigrants are fleeced, many operators close shop to move on to another part of the city or up the eastern seaboard to cities with large immigrant populations. They frequently make $100,000 to $200,000 a year. The few who have been caught rarely serve more than a few months in jail.</p>
        <p>''When we tell people that the doors are closed, that there is nothing we can do for them, they often do not want to believe it,'' said Angela Divaris, a lawyer for the Central American Refugee Center here. ''The people who carry out this fraud feed off of this desperation. They extract what are huge sums from these immigrants, usually thousands of dollars, and by the time the victims realize they have been cheated, the offices have shut down and the fraudulent lawyers have vanished.''</p>
        <p>The bogus claims filed by these con artists often keep immigrants' legitimate claims from being heard, Ms. Divaris said.</p>
        <p>For all the money that Mr. Rosales and Ms. Martinez paid to Ms. Sapio, Ms. Martinez said, late last year the I.N.S. deported him to Guatemala. Ms. Martinez filed a consumer complaint and informed the district attorney's office, but Ms. Sapio's immigration services office remains open.</p>
        <p>Ms. Martinez, who makes $1,200 a month as a housekeeper at the Park Avenue Extended Care Center in Long Beach, said she was still trying to pay the debt.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Martinez has receipts with Ms. Sapio's signature and canceled checks paid to Ms. Sapio and her office totaling $3,460, Ms. Sapio said she never received more than a few hundred dollars to accompany Mr. Rosales to the I.N.S.</p>
        <p>''She ran out of money, and we terminated our services because she could not pay,'' Ms. Sapio said. ''We did nothing illegal.'' She denied telling Ms. Martinez she was a lawyer.</p>
        <p>Ms. Martinez tells a different story. ''When we complained, Sapio told us she would call immigration and get us deported,'' said Ms. Martinez. ''She first tried to threaten me, but I have a green card. Then she tried to threaten my mother, but she is a citizen. It did not work with my family, but I know it works with many others.''</p>
        <p>The most common and effective ruse nowadays, according to advocates for immigrants, is to promise to provide a work permit for $2,000. The bogus lawyer fills out an application for asylum even though the client does not meet the criteria. The I.N.S. issues a receipt acknowledging the application. Then the con artist shows the immigrant the receipt as proof that things are moving along.</p>
        <p>''These people are shocked a few months later to get calls to appear for asylum hearings,'' said Joyce Antila Phipps, a lawyer for El Centro Hispanoamericano, an immigration service center in Plainfield, N.J.  ''They did not know that they had applied for asylum. Worse still, the story in the asylum application is usually false. These so-called immigration practitioners use stock asylum stories. Only the names are changed. When the cases come up most of their clients are ordered deported.''</p>
        <p>Other immigrants are misled because they are not familiar with immigration law. Salvador Cruz, 31, a Salvadoran who has been in the United States for 10 years, went to a man he thought was a lawyer who had distributed fliers about an opportunity to get residency after changes in immigration law.</p>
        <p>''He told me it was 100 percent certain I would get a card and charged me $1,300,'' Mr. Cruz said. ''I brought my four brothers in to pay the same amount and apply. We were all cheated out of our money.''  Immigration law is confusing, but especially so to those who do not speak English. The I.N.S. often takes months to publish new regulations and update application forms.</p>
        <p>In addition, the 1997 Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, an amnesty law known among many immigrants as ''la ley de siete anos'' -- the seven-year law -- is not as straightforward as it appears.</p>
        <p>The law offers amnesty, but the criteria differ depending on which Central American country the immigrant is from. While all applicants must have registered with the I.N.S. by 1991 to qualify, Cubans and Nicaraguans who entered the United States illegally to flee left-wing governments are free from deportation. But Salvadorans and Guatemalans must prove, for example, that they have been here at least seven years, are of good moral character and would suffer extreme hardship if they returned home.</p>
        <p>Profiteers and bogus lawyers often assure clients that living in the country for seven years is enough.</p>
        <p>Last year, Blanca Moza, 41, a Salvadoran immigrant, consulted with Manuel Herrera, who worked out of an office here. Mr. Herrera, whom she said she thought was a lawyer, told her that she qualified for residency because she had been here more than seven years. She paid him $1,289, and promised to pay another $400 when she was permitted residency.</p>
        <p>In July 1997, Ms. Moza said, she received a notice that she did not understand from the I.N.S. She took it to Mr. Herrera, who told her that it meant she would get her residency in six months, she said. ''Last year I began to study English,'' she said. ''I bought an electronic dictionary and slowly translated every word in the I.N.S. document. I realized that the letter from the I.N.S. was a denial.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Moza later testified against Mr. Herrera when Nassau County prosecutors charged him with fraud. He was convicted in December. He had made at least $150,000 a year from cases like Ms. Moza's, according to Monica J. Hickey, the assistant district attorney who prosecuted him. He was released after serving three months in prison, and he could not be located.</p>
        <p>While many immigrants are unfamiliar with the law, others face a significant language barrier. Many of the profiteers are notaries public, which in the United States allows them only to validate documents. But in Latin America, a ''notario'' is also a licensed lawyer. Travel agencies in Spanish-speaking neighborhoods sometimes play on this confusion. Large signs reading ''Notario'' adorn storefront windows.</p>
        <p>Hempstead is a center for the sale of forged green cards and other forms of immigration fraud, I.N.S. officials said. In January, a raid here uncovered a ring that had several hundred fake cards ready for sale. In a fraud and forgery scheme, Clover Richards was arrested in her office here in January. Ms. Hickey, who is also handling this case, said that Ms. Richards took thousands of dollars from Jamaican immigrants by promising to file religious worker petitions for them. She would take $3,000 to $12,000 a case, Ms. Hickey said, and has made at least $250,000 since 1997.</p>
        <p>Ms. Richards, the district attorney's office said, told immigrants to sign applications that she later filled in. When the applications were denied, she told her clients that they were approved and took more money for green card applications, Ms. Hickey said. Ms. Richards had no comment on the case.</p>
        <p>Advocates for immigrants say the profiteers often lurk around places where immigrants congregate, for example in the fast-food restaurants across the street from 26 Federal Plaza, where the immigration courts are.</p>
        <p>One recent morning, immigrants filling out I.N.S. forms were lined up at Everything OK Immigration Services Center in the basement of 311 Broadway. Signs in Chinese, Spanish and English promised to replace ''lost green cards'' and provide ''I.N.S. lawyers.'' Employees handed out fliers listing various services on one side and a $2.99 Chinese lunch special -- served in the same basement -- on the other. Outside, people who said they were lawyers and consultants offered immigrants their services.</p>
        <p>''You often see these fraudulent lawyers come up to immigrants outside Federal Plaza and ask if they need an attorney or want help,'' said Ms. Divaris, the refugee center lawyer.</p>
        <p>Maria Cardona, an I.N.S. spokeswoman in Washington, said that the agency was concerned about the reports of fraud. ''The I.N.S. takes very seriously the unscrupulous behavior of those who seek to benefit by exploiting vulnerable immigrants who only seek to abide by the law,'' she said. ''Going after these criminals is one of the agency's priorities in our interior enforcement strategy.''</p>
        <p>But immigration lawyers like Ms. Joyce and Ms. Divaris say that the I.N.S. has done little to crack down on the activity. And district attorney's offices rarely investigate the cases. Immigration advocates concede that it is due in part to the reluctance of victims to speak to authorities. But they say it is also because the bogus lawyers serve a useful function.</p>
        <p>''We cannot get the I.N.S. to take these people seriously,'' Ms. Phipps of El Centro Hispanoamericano said. ''After all, they are locating illegal immigrants and putting them into removal proceedings for the I.N.S.''</p>
