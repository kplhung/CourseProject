        <p>A wall of black granite -- 30 feet long, 12 feet high and etched with the names of each passenger and crew member -- is planned for the spot, where it will be surrounded by a sculpture garden including the entombed belongings of some of the victims.

        <p>On a windswept point overlooking the expanse of ocean where the fiery remnants of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 landed four years ago, relatives of some of the 230 people killed in the crash gathered today to break ground for a memorial.</p>
        <p>A wall of black granite -- 30 feet long, 12 feet high and etched with the names of each passenger and crew member -- is planned for the spot, where it will be surrounded by a sculpture garden including the entombed belongings of some of the victims. Along the entryway, flags are to be flown, one from each of the 14 countries that were home to the passengers and crew.</p>
        <p>''They say if you hold someone in your thoughts, they are not really gone,'' said John J. Seaman of Albany, whose niece, Michele Becker, 19, died in the crash. ''That is why today is so important to us.''</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater and James E. Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, all attended today's ceremony, a day before the fourth anniversary of the crash, on July 17, 1996.</p>
        <p>''Nothing any of us says can change what happened here or bring back the ones you love so much or miss so dearly,'' Mr. Pataki told the crowd, gathered under a tent at the edge of Smith Point beach on Long Island, near Shirley. ''But I do hope that this memorial will always remind you that the people of our nation -- indeed, the people of the world -- continue to mourn the loss of 230 very special people.''</p>
        <p>The federal government is in the final stages of its investigation, and officials met today with relatives of the victims to give them an update. Among the issues discussed, one participant said, were steps being considered for other airplanes to prevent similar crashes. The safety board, which is scheduled to meet next month to consider a report on the cause of the crash, has already cited an explosion in the center fuel tank, although it has not determined conclusively what ignited that explosion.</p>
        <p>More than half of the estimated $1.5 million needed to build the memorial has been raised, including $355,000 from the state, $200,000 from New York City, $25,000 from Suffolk County and about $100,000 from law firms representing families, organizers said. Thomas J. Gallagher of Seaford, N.Y., raised money last week with a six-day, 51-mile swim from near Kennedy International Airport to Smith Point, following the path of Flight 800. Organizers said they hoped to complete the memorial by next July, and to dedicate it on the fifth anniversary of the crash.</p>
