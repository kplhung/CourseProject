        <p>In the experimental environment of political information on the Net, two commercial Web sites, including one whose news operation is directed by the prominent journalist Carl Bernstein, are covering the elections and political conventions while maintaining partnerships under contract with the political parties.</p>
        <p>One company, SpeakOut.com, is providing technical tools at no cost to both parties to create systems to manage the online presentation of their party platforms. In exchange, the parties promote the Web site, through linking and other means.</p>
        <p>Another company, Voter.com, is charging campaigns to post information in its candidate sections as well as maintaining contracts with the major political parties in which party representatives ''advise Voter.com on ways to maintain 'balanced partisanship' in the way the Voter.com Web site presents candidates, issues, and procedures,'' according to a press release on the site. The parties, under the contract, also agree to promote the site.</p>
        <p>Both companies present news coverage of the parties and campaigns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bernstein, executive editor for Voter.com, said the news operation and the political division, which handles contracts with campaigns and parties, maintained ''an absolute separation.''</p>
        <p>''The news operation is absolutely sacrosanct,'' Mr. Bernstein said. He also said that ''one of the reasons I am here is to ensure that on the Web there is a first-rate political Web site with the highest news value.''</p>
        <p>He said that the company's contractual agreements with the campaigns were no different from the relationships between mainstream news organizations and advertisers.</p>
        <p>On the Web site, however, the content that the campaigns provide is not clearly identified as advertising, nor does the site indicate that campaigns had paid to place the information on those pages.</p>
        <p>Joshua King, vice president of external affairs for SpeakOut.com, said the company maintained a wall between news and the political division, which manages the partnerships with the parties. ''The proof is on the site,'' he said. ''You'll find things on our site that are critical and laudatory of all political persuasions.''</p>
        <p>These relationships raise questions about the distinction between news organizations and information providers, said Bob Steele, director of the ethics program at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies.</p>
        <p>''Even as an information site,'' he said, ''the content should be taken with a large grain of salt if the site is beholden to the politicians and the parties rather than to the citizens.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Steele added, ''It sounds like in both of these sites that there are connective tissues between the information content and the groups and individuals who are the subjects of reporting that appear to be very problematic.''</p>
