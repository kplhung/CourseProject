      <abstract>
        <p>Strong showing by Ralph Nader, Green Party presidential candidate, could pose threat not only to Vice Pres Gore in presidential race, but also to Repr Mark Udall, Democratic incumbent seeking second term from Congressional district near Boulder, Colo, which has sent Democrat to Washington in every election since 1974; Green Party candidate is Ron Forthofer (M)</p>

        <p>The locals here proudly recognize themselves as citizens of the ''People's Republic of Boulder,'' a smart-alecky tip of the hat to Colorado's quirkiest metropolis.</p>
        <p>Here, people who own pets are not pet owners; they are pet guardians. The City Council issues proclamations on foreign policy. Buildings have height restrictions so mountain views remain unobstructed.</p>
        <p>With so many freethinkers, environmentalists and cappuccino drinkers, all of whom are likely to be wearing Birkenstocks, Boulder was always considered a last bastion of liberalism and the center of a Congressional district that has sent a Democrat to Washington in every election since 1974.</p>
        <p>This year, the streak may be in jeopardy, and in many respects, the challenge facing Representative Mark Udall, who is seeking a second term, mirrors a problem that Vice President Al Gore has encountered in his quest for the presidency: both could lose the election because of a Green Party candidate siphoning Democratic votes.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Gore's case, a strong showing by the Green Party nominee, Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate who draws strong support from the left, could swing an otherwise close presidential election to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the all-but-named Republican nominee. Mr. Nader is especially popular in California, a state that Mr. Gore could ill afford to lose and still win the White House.</p>
        <p>But here in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, where many Democratic voters feel the party has abandoned them in its presidential-year shift to the center, Ron Forthofer, the Green candidate, expects to do more than deny Mr. Udall re-election in a year in which Democrats need a shift of only six seats to regain control of the House.</p>
        <p>''I am running to win,'' Mr. Forthofer said, forecasting a result that would make him the first Green to win a seat in Congress. ''I'm concerned about Udall taking votes away from me.''</p>
        <p>In another district, such boasting might be dismissed as political pipe dreaming. But here, a steady influx of high-tech companies has leavened the electorate in recent years, to the point where unaffiliated voters outnumber registered Republicans as well as Democrats.</p>
        <p>Even though President Clinton won the district with big percentages -- 55 in 1992 and 61 in 1996 -- Mr. Udall only squeaked by in 1998 with 50 percent of the vote, to 47 percent for his Republican challenger, Bob Greenlee, the Boulder mayor. This year's Republican candidate will be chosen in a primary on Aug. 14. David M. Baker of the Libertarian Party is also running for the seat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forthofer, 56, a retired professor of biological statistics, has never run for office before. As a longtime advocate of civil rights, food safety and increased health care benefits, he is echoing themes raised by Mr. Nader: criticizing corporate welfare, military spending and the influence corporations have over Republicans and Democrats through campaign contributions.</p>
        <p>And, as one of 131 Greens running for office this year, he is doing it on a shoestring budget. While Mr. Udall's latest report to the Federal Election Commission shows that he has raised over $315,000 in the first half of the year and has over $500,000 in the bank, Mr. Forthofer said his campaign expected to spend no more than $35,000.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Udall, 49, whose father, Morris K., served as an Arizona congressman for 30 years and whose uncle Stewart was secretary of Interior under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, the challenge from Mr. Forthofer has been jarring.</p>
        <p>Mr. Udall's voting record suggests that the two agree on most issues, and some time ago, Mr. Udall said, he pursued Mr. Forthofer as an ally, to work with him and galvanize support against the Republican nominee. For now, two Republican candidates have declared themselves: Carolyn Cox, a retired businesswoman, and Larry Johnson, a perennial candidate. A third, Sandy Hume, the Boulder treasurer, could emerge as a strong write-in choice.</p>
        <p>''You look at my record,'' Mr. Udall said. ''Nobody has been better on the issues, and I asked him to work with me and told him that in a two-party system, a third party often elects the greater evil. But it was to no avail.''</p>
        <p>Just as Mr. Nader responded upon accepting the Green Party's presidential nomination three weeks ago, Mr. Forthofer dismissed the argument that Greens only pave the way for Republican victories, insisting that the time was right for all Greens to make their move.</p>
        <p>''We want to make our own way now,'' he said. ''We've been told that for how many years, that this isn't the right time. That only prevents us from finding out how much progress we've made. But as long as people vote only Democrat or Republican, voices will never be tallied, and we will never know how strong we are.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Udall, a tireless campaigner, said the changing nature of the district was forcing him to regard no challenge lightly. ''I'm taking his campaign seriously, and I take the Republicans seriously,'' he said. ''I'm confident, but I'm not going to take anything for granted.''</p>
