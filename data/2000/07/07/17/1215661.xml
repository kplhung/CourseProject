        <p>Deutsche Telekom has made informal overtures about reigniting merger talks with Qwest Communications International, executives close to both companies said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The move comes as Deutsche Telekom is simultaneously conducting intensive negotiations with the VoiceStream Wireless Corporation, the  United States wireless operator that recently acquired Omnipoint Communications in New York. If Deutsche Telekom is able to solidify a deal with both, it would achieve its goal of becoming a significant player in the American telephone market, controlling both a nationwide wireless and fixed-line network.</p>

        <p>Deutsche Telekom has made informal overtures about reigniting merger talks with Qwest Communications International, executives close to both companies said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The move comes as Deutsche Telekom is simultaneously conducting intensive negotiations with the VoiceStream Wireless Corporation, the  United States wireless operator that recently acquired Omnipoint Communications in New York. If Deutsche Telekom is able to solidify a deal with both, it would achieve its goal of becoming a significant player in the American telephone market, controlling both a nationwide wireless and fixed-line network.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom's overtures come about four months after talks between itself and Qwest collapsed when U S West, which was completing its own merger with Qwest, balked at the price Deutsche Telekom was willing to pay for its shares.</p>
        <p>According to executives close to both companies, Ron Sommer, Deutsche Telekom's chairman, met with Philip P. Anschutz, Qwest's largest shareholder, recently about reopening talks during a whirlwind tour of the United States. While it remains unclear whether the talks will formally resume, Deutsche Telekom is eager to keep the possibility of acquiring Qwest open. Joseph P. Nacchio, Qwest's chief executive, is also eager to reach a deal with Deutsche Telekom, the executives said.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Deutsche Telekom could not be reached. A spokesman for Qwest declined to comment.</p>
        <p>The informal talks between Deutsche Telekom and Qwest, which executives close to both companies stress are in the most preliminary stage, are just one of many that Deutsche Telekom is holding.</p>
        <p>In addition to negotiating a deal with VoiceStream, which the executives said has a better than 50 percent chance of taking place, Deutsche Telekom is still holding informal talks with Cable &amp; Wireless of Britain, BellSouth and Global Crossing. While Deutsche Telekom continues to consider Sprint, which became available when its merger with WorldCom unraveled last week, executives close to Deutsche Telekom said it had turned most of its attention to other alternatives. Sprint's chairman and chief executive, William Esrey, also insisted last week that the company was not up for sale and that he had held no merger talks with other companies.</p>
        <p>While Deutsche Telekom is also negotiating with VoiceStream, NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile telephone operator, is also considering its own bid for VoiceStream, which has 2.3 million customers.</p>
        <p>VoiceStream is particularly attractive to foreign bidders because its wireless network runs on a standard called GSM, which is compatible with networks in both Europe and Asia and would allow one company to possibly create a seamless worldwide network. Every other United States-based wireless operator uses standards that are incompatible with European and Asian wireless networks.</p>
