        <p>One goal of the Lincoln Center Festival's Electronic Evolution series is to demonstrate the enormous diversity of sound-producing technologies available to composers today: synthesizers, digital keyboards, sophisticated computer software and whatnot.</p>
        <p>But Friday night's program at the Low Library Rotunda at Columbia University, the third of five concerts, was devoted to what could be called the original instrument of electronic music: the tape recorder.</p>
        <p>''Masterpieces of 20th-Century Multichannel Tape Music,'' as the program was called, offered six works written between 1956 and 1990, each created by cutting and splicing segments of tape. And true to the historically accurate protocols from the early decades of electronic music, the audience at this concert sat passively in the darkened space listening to works played through loudspeakers.</p>
        <p>For this purpose the enormous rotunda, with its domed ceiling and echoing stone walls, was an ideal performance space: the audience sat in the middle of the floor encircled by speakers. The one modern innovation was that each work was introduced with ''electronic program notes'' and accompanied by computerized visual representations of the sounds being heard.</p>
        <p>The program began with one of the first acknowledged masterpieces of electronic music, Edgard Varese's ''Poeme Electronique'' (1958). It's interesting that composers during this period who were most fascinated by the possibilities that the new electronic technology offered for exploring sound were mostly those also drawn to the 12-tone aesthetic. So, though Varese's work can in no way be called a 12-tone composition, its montage of sounds assiduously avoids tonal references and even regular pulse.</p>
        <p>What gives it shape is Varese's keen sense of aural architecture. Also, unlike so many works that came in its wake, long episodes of ''Poeme Electronique are strikingly quiet, restrained and gentle.</p>
        <p>Karlheinz Stockhausen's ''Gesang der Junglinge'' (''Song of the Youths''), from 1956, combines electronically produced sounds with the recorded fragments of boy sopranos, representing the youths in the Book of Daniel who were thrown into a furnace by King Nebuchadnezzar for refusing to worship an idol. And whenever a faint, intact snippet of a sung melodic line comes through the rustling collage of sounds, the effect is deeply touching.</p>
        <p>Paul Lansky's ''Night Traffic'' (1990) could not have been more different. Mr. Lansky relishes tonality and consonance. So here the recorded sound of whooshing cars passing by on highways is presented against a backdrop of sustained, sweetly angelic tonal chords. Though pretty, it sounds like some tape of New Age music for a group meditation class.</p>
        <p>After a while pieces for multichannel tape recorder start to sound alike. For all the ingenuity involved in creating strange sounds, Jean-Baptiste Barriere's ''Chreode'' (1983) and Denis Smalley's ''Vortex'' (1982), the next two works on this program, just ran on and on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smalley, who cares intensely about musical form, has written of using ''attacking events'' to demarcate structural points in his tape pieces. Such talk seems like so much technobabble. Haven't all composers, from Bach to Little Richard, used attacking events like downbeats and accents to indicate new phrases and musical structure?</p>
        <p>At 23 minutes, Iannis Xenakis's ''Bohor'' (1962) also has a run-on quality to it. But the fascinating sources he drew from to create this sound montage include a Laotian mouth organ, Iraqi bell-trimmed jewelry and Hindu chant. Somehow the waves of sound that flow by, crackling with static and buzz, seem organic. Still, it must be said that seeing the passing sounds represented in intricate, multicolored, up-to-date computer imagery certainly made the listening experience more engaging.</p>
