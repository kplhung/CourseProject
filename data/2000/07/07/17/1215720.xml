        <p>Questioning Polls in Mexico  Most polls published before Mexico's presidential vote showed the governing party candidate ahead of the man who won. The governing party reportedly pressured the news media not to use polls that showed the challenger leading. A debate is under way in Mexico about whether pollsters erred or whether voters changed their minds.</p>

        <p>Gore and Bush Speak On TV News Programs  Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush gave voters a chance for the first time to make a side-by-side comparison as the two sat for hourlong interviews on network television.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Using an Incumbent's Strategy  Gov. George W. Bush has been taking a low-key approach to campaigning lately. The style and schedule are deliberate, reflecting the campaign's strategic confidence that he can mold his image by carefully choreographing television images in battleground states. It is almost as if he is running a modified version of an incumbent's Rose Garden strategy.</p>

        <p>Campaigning on the Water  Vice President Al Gore plans to ply the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes in a boat after the Democratic convention in Los Angeles, campaign officials said. The idea is to take advantage of the momentum that presidential candidates traditionally gain after their conventions.</p>

        <p>Violence Surges in Los Angeles  A new wave of violence and killing has come to south Los Angeles, and people there said they were afraid and baffled by the surge and just as determined to stop it.</p>

        <p>Pushing Repeal of a Tax  House Republicans plan to begin a push this week to roll back a tax imposed in 1993 on the Social Security benefits received by the roughly one-fifth of retired people with the highest incomes.</p>

        <p>Green Party Role in Colorado  The challenge facing Representative Mark Udall of Colorado mirrors a problem that Vice President Al Gore has encountered in his quest for the presidency: Both could lose the election because of a Green Party candidate siphoning off Democratic votes. In Mr. Gore's case, a strong showing by Ralph Nader could swing an otherwise close election to Gov. George W. Bush. Mr. Udall faces Ron Forthofer, in a district where many Democratic voters feel the party has abandoned them.</p>

        <p>Counting Spanish Speakers In Nielsen TV Ratings  Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language broadcaster, has been putting pressure on Nielsen Media Research to add more Spanish-speaking households to its sample in New York City. Nielsen officials estimated that they were undercounting Spanish speakers in the market by about 300,000 households. But executives at most of the English-language stations have been fighting the move.</p>

        <p>Preying on Immigrants  Hundreds of con artists are preying on the New York region's illegal immigrants, whose ignorance of the legal system is matched only by their desperation, law enforcement officials say. These profiteers, who often pose as lawyers, have been around for decades, adjusting their schemes as immigration laws change.</p>

        <p>New Pricing for Electricity  A growing number of utilities are varying the price of power based on supply and demand to make sure there is enough to go around. The approach is a novel one for electric utilities, and it is inducing companies and individual consumers to change how they use electricity.</p>
