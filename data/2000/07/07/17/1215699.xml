        <p>Who cares that most consumers wouldn't know a midrange Unix server from a refrigerator?</p>
        <p>That hasn't stopped I.B.M. from embarking on a big advertising campaign this week to proclaim the superiority of its Unix server computers over those made by its rival, Sun Microsystems. The campaign will play out on TV spots, Web banner ads, billboards and guerrilla-style sidewalk posters. The ads began appearing earlier this month.</p>
        <p>Departing from I.B.M.'s traditionally restrained approach to advertising, the ads proclaim that ''It's easy to eclipse a Sun,'' then go on to offer side-by-side comparisons of I.B.M. and Sun systems.</p>
        <p>''We're in a leapfrog game and we want to seize this opportunity,'' said  Lauren Flaherty, I.B.M.'s vice president for integrated advertising. Unix servers, machines that run the Unix operating system and enable many users to share data on a network, are in particularly hot demand these days by Internet companies involved in e-commerce.</p>
        <p>What gives I.B.M. bragging rights? The company's confidence got a huge boost in April, when the Internet domain-name registration company Network Solutions announced it was replacing its aging Sun servers with I.B.M. Unix servers. Since then, I.B.M. has racked up several other high-profile corporate customers at Sun's expense, including FedEx, Budget Rent-a-Car and Credit Suisse.</p>
        <p>An I.B.M. spokesman attributed the gains in part to delays in shipments of Sun's next-generation Unix processor.</p>
        <p>Sun still has a big lead in the $30 billion market for Unix servers of all sizes, and Hewlett-Packard is in second place. But in the midrange market, where systems sell for $100,000 to $1 million, Sun is in third place behind Hewlett and I.B.M., according to the market research firm IDC.</p>
        <p>Sun doesn't find I.B.M.'s campaign very amusing and accuses it of mixing apples and oranges. ''When you're a scared animal in the corner, you do everything to fight back,'' said John Loiacono, chief marketing officer at Sun.</p>
