        <p>Fissures have appeared this season in the dynasty that is the Yankees, from the growing burdens of pressure and time. But the Yankees demonstrated again yesterday why they will be a dangerous postseason team, if they qualify.</p>
        <p>Nobody does a comeback like the Yankees, who opportunistically pieced together fragments of offense, drawing walks and slapping singles, to score five runs in the bottom of the ninth to tie the Phillies. Nobody can match the Yankees' potential for relaxed relentlessness.</p>
        <p>After Mariano Rivera surrendered a two-run homer in the top of the 10th, the Yankees scored three times, David Justice slamming a one-out single off Jeff Brantley to win the game, 9-8, rewarding those few among the 53,131 who stayed to the end at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>''This is probably the most memorable win we've had this year,'' Paul O'Neill said.</p>
        <p>Dwight Gooden proved pivotal in his first relief appearance for the Yankees, holding the Phillies to one run over five and a third  innings after he took over for Andy Pettitte in the third inning. Bernie Williams had a home run, his 21st, and hit singles in both the ninth- and 10th-inning rallies. The Yankees are 47-39, a half-game ahead of Toronto in the American League East.</p>
        <p>It had all the makings of a crummy day, Chuck Knoblauch said later. Pettitte couldn't keep the ball down and was ripped for nine hits before he left in the third inning. The Phillies were pounding the Yankees, 6-1, after four innings. The Yankees started a few rallies, all of them aborted, and their frustration was probably heightened by the fact that the pitcher who was shutting them down, Paul Byrd, does not look like a major league pitcher. Byrd possesses the body of Wiffle Ball star, slight in frame and fastball, and bends at the waist with runners on base the way Phil Niekro did in his late 40's, his socks pulled up high.</p>
        <p>But Byrd, who had almost been scratched yesterday because of a stiff neck, grittily confounded the Yankees, changing speeds, keeping his hittable stuff just far enough out of harm's way, at the borders of the strike zone. Scott Brosius and O'Neill flung bats angrily after making outs; Williams dumped his helmet and bat on the ground after whiffing to end the seventh inning, and fans poured into the aisles, reaching into their pockets for car keys and MetroCards, the afternoon seemingly wasted.</p>
        <p>Ryan Thompson led off the bottom of the ninth inning for the Yankees, the score still 6-1, and grounded to short, a routine play. Desi Relaford fielded it cleanly, but his rushed throw to first pulled Brian Hunter off the base. Brosius flipped a soft liner over shortstop. Steve Schrenk, the Philadelphia pitcher, walked Knoblauch. Derek Jeter -- who had three walks in his previous 24 games -- waited out a four-pitch walk, forcing home a run.</p>
        <p>Jose Vizcaino, acquired by the Yankees in a trade last month, said after the game that these were the types of at-bats he had seen for years, watching the Yankees on television. ''This is why they've won this many World Series,'' Justice said.</p>
        <p>There was a pitching change, the left-hander Bryan Ward taking over for Schrenk. Jeff Brantley, the Philadelphia closer, was warming up, but Phillies Manager Terry Francona desperately wanted to get through the game without using Brantley, who pitched Thursday and Friday and warmed up fully Saturday.</p>
        <p>O'Neill took a pitch out of the strike zone, whacked at a high fastball, looking to tie the game -- and drove it deep to left, a sacrifice fly. The Phillies' lead was down to three runs.</p>
        <p>Batting right-handed, Williams punched a single through the big hole on the right side of the infield, scoring Knoblauch as Jeter stopped at second. Justice worked the count to three balls and two strikes, the pressure on Ward mounting, and drew a walk. Bases loaded. Players from both teams stood at the railing in front of their respective dugouts.</p>
        <p>Tino Martinez blooped a single into right-center, just in front of a diving Bobby Abreu, and Jeter scored. Phillies 6, Yankees 5, only one out. Jorge Posada struck out, however, and with just one out needed, Francona called for Brantley.</p>
        <p>Yankee Manager Joe Torre inserted Vizcaino as a pinch-hitter for Thompson, knowing that Vizcaino had four hits and two walks in 14 plate appearances against Brantley, a favorable matchup -- and Vizcaino smashed a liner that tipped off the glove of third baseman Scott Rolen. The ball fell, Williams scored, the game was tied, the Yankees were clapping and shouting in their dugout, Martinez, in the dugout for a pinch-runner, raising two hands.</p>
        <p>Brantley fell behind Brosius, three balls and one strike, struggling, before Brosius popped out, sending the game into the 10th inning.</p>
        <p>Rivera was in trouble immediately in the 10th. Rolen lined a single to center to lead off -- only the fourth time in 35 games that Rivera had allowed a hit to the first batter he faced. With two outs, Rivera left a fastball over the middle for Hunter to crush; the closer sat stoically in the dugout after the half-inning, the Yankees trailing, 8-6.</p>
        <p>There was no time for Knoblauch to mope, for he led off against Brantley, fouled off a two-strike pitch and drew his second walk in two innings; he hadn't drawn two walks in a game since May 19. Jeter hovered over the plate and Brantley bounced a fastball off his elbow. All Brantley had left physically, Francona acknowledged later, ''is guts,'' and, the manager said, ''that's a shame.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill singled to right-center, scoring Knoblauch. Williams -- batting left-handed this time -- slapped a single to the opposite field again, through the hole between short and third, and Jeter scored unchallenged, O'Neill stopping at second. The game was tied again, the fans bellowing.</p>
        <p>Brantley threw a ball to Justice to fall behind, 2-1, and was shaking his head: Doomed. Justice then leaned over the plate to drive a liner to left. Ron Gant raced back and reached up with his glove. O'Neill hesitated between second and third, unsure -- until he saw the ball carry over Gant's glove. Then O'Neill charged around third and across home plate, giving high-fives to the few teammates who hadn't rushed to hug Justice and thump him on the helmet between first and second base.</p>
        <p>Before this comeback, Knoblauch said, it seemed as if the Yankees' rallies mostly fell short this year. This was something different. This seemed like old times.</p>
