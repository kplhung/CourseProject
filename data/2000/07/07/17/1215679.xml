        <p>Chris Young of Princeton will not be able to play professional baseball and college basketball because Ivy League rules do not allow professional athlete in one sport to compete on intercollegiate level in another sport; photo (M)</p>

        <p>The rule is buried in the Ivy League Presidents' Agreement, adopted at the league's inception 25 years before Chris Young was born. Young did not know the rule existed when he entered Princeton in 1998, but it may alter his athletic career.</p>
        <p>The rule, Section IV-A-7, prohibits an Ivy League athlete from signing a contract with a professional team and participating in another intercollegiate sport. Every other conference allows this sort of flexibility, allowing someone like Drew Henson to play minor league baseball and still quarterback the Michigan Wolverines in the fall, or Danny Ainge to take Brigham Young's basketball team to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament while playing for the Toronto Blue Jays.</p>
        <p>But in those rare instances when a two-sport Ivy League athlete is held in high enough regard to be wooed by the pros, a player must decide. And Young, who plays both basketball and baseball at Princeton, has a decision to make.</p>
        <p>Young is a 6-foot-10-inch center, good enough to start from his first day at Princeton. He was the Ivy League rookie of the year and last season became the sixth player at Princeton to be named all-Ivy as a sophomore. He led the Tigers in scoring (13.5 points), rebounding (5.8) and blocked shots (73) and was second in assists (87).</p>
        <p>He was also a pitcher for the baseball team, good enough to be named all-Ivy as a freshman and become the first male athlete in the league to be rookie of the year in two sports. As a sophomore this spring, he was 5-0 with a 1.82 earned run average, and in the N.C.A.A. tournament, he held fifth-ranked Houston hitless for four innings before leaving with the lead.</p>
        <p>Another rule that Young was not aware of allows a baseball team to draft a player once he turns 21, superseding the normal process of drafting a collegian after his junior year. Young turned 21 in May and was drafted in the third round last month by the Pittsburgh Pirates.</p>
        <p>He has also heard rumblings from basketball scouts that he will be a first-round selection if he enters the National Basketball Association draft following his junior year.</p>
        <p>If Young signs with the Pirates, however, he gives up his final two years of basketball at Princeton.</p>
        <p>''It's a tough decision,'' he said. ''And at times it's been frustrating, but I've been trying to keep an optimistic attitude about it. So many kids are not so lucky. I'm just in a very fortunate position and I'm just trying to enjoy it.''</p>
        <p>Young is spending most of his summer on the beach on Cape Cod, relaxing. But every fifth night, he treks to the mound for the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod League, and this has only made his decision more difficult. In one of the most prestigious amateur leagues, Young has been one of the best pitchers. He is 2-2 with a 2.78 E.R.A. and 41 strikeouts in 32 1/3 innings.</p>
        <p>If he returns to college this fall, the Pirates lose his rights the first day he goes to class. Young would most likely move up in the baseball draft, however, having dropped as far as he did because he made it clear that even if he signs and gives up on basketball, he is committed to returning to Princeton to finish his degree in politics and fitting in professional baseball after that. He also remains adamant that it will take first-round money to get him to sign. The lowest bonus for any of the first-round picks who have signed so far this year was $950,000, and the final first-round selection got $1,225,000.</p>
        <p>Young said the Pirates had offered him what they gave their third-round pick last year (believed to be in the $500,000 range). But he said he had set up financial parameters for signing, which he feels are ''reasonable to get me to give up basketball and baseball at Princeton.''</p>
        <p>There is talk at Princeton of addressing the rule, which the basketball coach, Bill Carmody, called archaic. Few Ivy League players have been in position to raise the issue, the last being Mark DeRosa, a football player and shortstop at Penn whom the Atlanta Braves drafted in 1996.</p>
        <p>But any change would be too late to accommodate Young now. And as much as money may be the deciding factor, he has tried to follow his passion, too. For someone who grew up in Texas idolizing Nolan Ryan and whose fastball has been clocked at 94 miles an hour with control that would have made Ryan envious at this age, the passion is baseball.</p>
        <p>''I think his whole life, while he really likes basketball and enjoys playing at Princeton, until his junior year of high school he thought he was just going to be a baseball player,'' said Scott Bradley, Princeton's baseball coach, who spent nine seasons in the major leagues as a catcher. As much as Young likes basketball, Bradley said, ''since he's a little kid, when he goes to sleep, he dreams about pitching in the big leagues.''</p>
        <p>Bradley acknowledged, however, that in basketball, Young keeps getting better. ''He's a 6-foot-10 kid who shoots 3-pointers, blocks shots, can run and do so many things,'' Bradley said.</p>
        <p>''He's not blessed as explosively fast or a great leaper,'' Bradley said. ''But he's an athlete in the purest terms. He's got the feel, a real feel for the game, for both games. I think what people see is the 6-foot-10 body and the first thing they think is Randy Johnson. I played with Randy and caught him, but Chris is like Greg Maddux in Randy Johnson's body.</p>
        <p>''I'm convinced he's going to pitch in the big leagues someday.''</p>
        <p>His father, Charles Young, said, ''Ever since he's been a little kid he always wanted to play professional baseball.'' But Chris Young maintains his options. ''It might seem that baseball is more my love now because it's come up quicker,'' he said, ''but my dream has always been to be a professional athlete. Which sport, it's hard for me to say.</p>
        <p>''That's the tough part. People say, 'Why not go back and concentrate on just one or the other and make yourself a first-rounder?' That's something that would be nice, but I've always played both, and my love is so great, it's tough to choose and give one up.''</p>
        <p>What makes the decision harder is that no one is certain which sport provides a brighter future. Coaches and scouts agree that when Young leaves one sport behind, he will grow in the other. He has squeezed work for one sport within the confines of the other's schedule, walking over to the baseball diamond after basketball practice to throw, and shooting baskets during his down time on the diamond.</p>
        <p>There is also the tantalizing notion that he will get better and the offers will be greater in a year in both sports. On the basketball court, he has outplayed Chris Mihm of Texas, the first center taken in the draft this year. That starts the math going in Young's mind: a first-round draft pick in the N.B.A. earns a three-year guaranteed contract.</p>
        <p>''People talk about him in baseball as being polished, a big guy with control,'' Carmody said. ''As a basketball player, it's the same thing. He came in and was a good passer right away, understood where to throw the ball. He's different than guys we've had before in that he's a legitimate center with a center's body. He was picked No. 89 in baseball and next year's he's at worst in the top 20 in basketball. But it has to be from the kid's heart. Is there a passion of one over the other?''</p>
        <p>Young said that if there were no obstacles, ''there's no doubt I'd like to go back to Princeton.''</p>
        <p>''It's a tough decision, and I'm going to have to weigh whether I think next year will improve my status,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, he said, ''I'm going to enjoy it, whatever I decide.''</p>
