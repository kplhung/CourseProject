        <p>Lesley Mackie, an elephant keeper at the Indianapolis Zoo, nudged the 400-pound baby aside with her hip. The baby, Amali, made elephant history with her birth on March 6: she is the first African elephant conceived using artificial insemination. But on a recent afternoon, she was grabbing a visitor's shirt with her trunk and chewing on the seam.</p>
        <p>''She's a toddler,'' Ms. Mackie said. ''Everything goes in the mouth.''</p>
        <p>Amali's birth has generated considerable  attention at the zoo and around town. A name-the-baby contest drew about 6,000 entries. (Amali, an Arabic word meaning hope, was submitted by a local librarian.) Crowds packed the viewing area for weeks as soon as the baby made her first public appearance with her mother, Kubwa.</p>
        <p>On July 7, the zoo held a contest for visitors to guess the combined weight of four female elephants. After the elephants trudged around a ring and took turns on a scale (together, they were just over 29,000 pounds), each strode to the side so children and grown-ups could touch their smooth, hard tusks, their supple leathery ears and the bristly tufts on their wrinkled gray skin.</p>
        <p>These days a world-class zoological achievement is just one more item on a list of new downtown attractions that are helping Indianapolis shine. Public and private investment downtown totaled $3 billion in the 1990's, and an additional $1.5 billion worth of projects will open over the next two years. Much of the construction, including a minor league baseball park, a new arena for the Pacers basketball team, a $14.5 million botanical garden next to the zoo and a new 165,000-square-foot headquarters for the Indiana Historical Society, came during the tenure of Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, who is now a top domestic-policy adviser in the presidential campaign of Gov. George Bush of Texas. Mr. Goldsmith's successor is Bart Peterson, the first Democratic mayor here in decades. Mr. Peterson called Amali's birth ''a great success story for our zoo and a great international attraction.''</p>
        <p>''A decade ago, there wasn't a lot of there there,'' said Tamara Zahn, president of Indianapolis Downtown, a nonprofit group that promotes development. ''Downtown kind of rolled up around 5 o'clock.''</p>
        <p>The men's college basketball finals brought the spotlight to town in the spring, and will return in 2006. Promoters like Ms. Zahn also brag about the recent move of the National Collegiate Athletic Association headquarters here from Kansas City, Mo.  This spring the N.C.A.A. opened a museum here on the west side, also near the zoo.</p>
        <p>''The zoo has been an anchor on the west side since they opened and has done an excellent job of adding attractions and being a national model,'' Ms. Zahn said. ''Amali is one more unique thing that Indianapolis has to offer. For example, Shaq, when he was in town, made a point of visiting Amali.''</p>
        <p>Shaquille O'Neal, the Los Angeles Lakers' star who was here last month during the N.B.A. championship series, and other zoo visitors have been able to see an unquestionably cute baby elephant. But they may not have realized that Amali was the result of more than a decade of scientific work aimed at improving elephant birth rates in captivity. As the populations of wild elephants have dropped sharply to 500,000 in Africa and  50,000 in Asia, it has become more difficult to transport the animals outside those regions. The fewer than 500 elephants of both species in North America have produced four or five births a year, a rate far below what would be needed to maintain the population, Robert J. Wiese, a population biologist at the Fort Worth Zoo, said.</p>
        <p>Elephant bulls can be belligerent during  mating season, and many zoos hold only females. Transporting elephants for mating is tricky; it is easier to transfer semen.</p>
        <p>Many of the routines of human fertility clinics are the same for the artificial insemination of elephants: blood samples, charts of hormone levels, ultrasound images and concerns about the age and physical condition of the mothers-to-be. Each attempt  costs $10,000 to $20,000, and success depends on precise timing.</p>
        <p>''If you are not getting your animals bred by the time they are 30 you've sort of missed the boat,'' said Dr. Janine Brown, a Smithsonian Institution expert on elephant hormones. Her work and other advances have made it possible for scientists to use fluctuations in hormone levels and new ultrasound techniques to predict ovulation.</p>
        <p>After birth, elephants still face many dangers, including indifferent mothers, fast-moving viral infections and aggressive  adult elephants that do not know how to act around newborns. Ivory, a 3-ton teenager at the Indianapolis Zoo, knocked into little Amali once, sending the baby into shock.</p>
        <p>The first conceptions using artificial insemination were two years ago. The first birth, of an Asian male named Haji, was in November, at the Dickerson Park Zoo in Springfield, Mo. Amali was born about three months later.</p>
        <p>Now, Ivory has been artificially inseminated and is expected to give birth next month. ''We are very convinced that she will be a good mother, once the hormones kick in and she has a baby of her own,'' said Deborah Olson, a zoo official. Two other pregnancies from artificial inseminations have been confirmed: an African elephant in Austria, and an Asian elephant at the National Zoo in Washington.</p>
        <p>All this is meant to supplement, not replace, natural breeding, explained Dr. Dennis Schmitt, an associate professor of veterinary medicine at Southwest Missouri State University, who attended the births of Amali and 13 other elephants since 1985 and who developed many of the techniques used in the artificial inseminations.</p>
        <p>Zoo elephants pose special reproductive problems, Dr. Schmitt said. ''We tend to like elephants in captivity that are round and fat,'' he said. ''That's not what you want -- you want an elephant that's not overweight. We want them to be physically fit.''</p>
        <p>Amali's mother was on a rigorous exercise program that included leg lifts and daily walks. Now Ivory is on the same regimen.</p>
        <p>The birth watch, a 24-hour-a-day vigil, will begin soon and continue for several weeks using video cameras, volunteers and zoo workers to look for rocking, unusual pacing or other signs that labor is about to begin.</p>
        <p>Ivory's youth is a plus, and so is the experience zoo workers gained when Amali was born. But in elephant reproduction nothing can be taken for granted, especially with African elephants, which have reproduced more poorly than the Asians.</p>
        <p>''Right now getting Africans on the ground is a phenomenal thing,'' said Dr. Brown, the Smithsonian endocrinologist who will be testing Ivory's blood to help determine when labor is about to begin. ''To have two is absolutely outstanding.''</p>
