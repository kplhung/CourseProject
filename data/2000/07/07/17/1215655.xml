        <p>Hoping to find survivors trapped in air pockets, divers searched about 70 trailers today that had been hurled from a campground into a lake by a tornado on Friday evening 125 miles south of here.</p>
        <p>The tornado, just before 7 p.m., obliterated the campground with winds of almost 200 miles an hour. The death toll was raised to 10 today with the death of a camper who had been hospitalized. The dead included a 2-year-old child.</p>
        <p>Officials said it probably was so deadly because the campers and fishermen on the lake did not hear storm warnings and could not see the storm coming.</p>
        <p>''A trailer park like this offers absolutely no protection in the winds of a tornado, set down in a valley where it is difficult to see the storm approaching,'' Dennis Dudley, a severe weather specialist for the Calgary office of Environment Canada, a federal agency, said at a news conference today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dudley was on vacation with his family when he saw the threatening weather formation and called in a warning.</p>
        <p>Divers searched Pine Lake today, looking for bodies of weekend fishermen who may have been tossed from their boats when the storm hit. The search was complicated by low visibility and waters contaminated with battery acid from the submerged vehicles. Military and police divers also searched the trailers that were blown into the lake by the storm.</p>
        <p>Richard Smith, the director of the search, said today that he believed that almost all of the 300 people staying at Green Acres, a private campground, had been accounted for.</p>
        <p>The storm injured at least half of the people in the campground, sending 132 to hospitals for treatment, many for broken bones.</p>
        <p>The tornado was Canada's deadliest since a similar July evening in 1987 when a tornado struck Edmonton, killing 27 people, injuring 300 and causing $230 million in property damage. Alberta usually experiences 16 to 20 tornadoes a year, but most are relatively weak.</p>
        <p>Although a severe thunderstorm warning, with a potential for tornadoes, had been issued about 40 minutes earlier, the campers apparently had not heard the broadcast warnings, officials said today. Most were sitting down for their evening meal when the storm suddenly roared over a hill.</p>
        <p>''Hailstones started falling,'' Harold English, a camper, told a local reporter. ''The wind came up and trees started breaking -- some 8 inches thick -- near our trailer. Within two minutes it was all over.''</p>
        <p>Phil Lapreirie, who was camping on Friday, had stitches on his face today and his arm was in a sling. ''After this thing hit, I jumped into my trailer as it was going by,'' he said. ''It was moving when I got in -- I knew my wife was in there. I happened to get inside, and the next thing you know it's upside down, around, then we hit the dirt.''</p>
