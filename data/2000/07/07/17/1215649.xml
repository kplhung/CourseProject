        <p>In a report issued on Tuesday, the University Teachers for Human Rights in Jaffna, the focus of the impending battle in Sri Lanka's north, describe a reign of terror in the region.

        <p>Tamil rebels preparing for a showdown with the Sri Lankan Army for control of the island's most important Tamil town have been invading schoolrooms and rounding up boys and girls in their early teens to send into battle, a Tamil rights organization said this week.</p>
        <p>In a report issued on Tuesday, the University Teachers for Human Rights in Jaffna, the focus of the impending battle in Sri Lanka's north, describe a reign of terror in the region. They say rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam intimidate teachers and public officials, pull the biggest children out of classes, raid orphanages and go to homes to demand that families turn over teenage sons and daughters. Rough estimates indicate that hundreds of children, some as young as 9 or 10, are being conscripted.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials here and in Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, have condemned the rebels' increasing use of child soldiers. Olara A. Otunnu, the United Nations official responsible for trying to end the military use of children, confirmed in an interview that since the Tamil Tigers began a campaign late last year to recapture the Jaffna peninsula, the recruitment of children has soared.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, the Tigers promised Mr. Otunnu to stop recruiting children under 17 and sending anyone under 18 into battle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Otunnu said the situation showed how difficult it was to translate international agreements against child soldiers into action, particularly when irregular forces are involved.</p>
        <p>He said the practice of recruiting children in Sri Lanka was confined to the Tigers. He said there had never been any evidence of recruitment of children by the government army.</p>
        <p>Mr. Otunnu added that the report from the Jaffna Tamil rights group was supported by independent information he has collected from other private organizations and United Nations officials in Sri Lanka. Colin Glennie, Unicef's representative in Colombo, said, ''We don't have figures, but we know it's happening.''</p>
        <p>For more than a quarter of a century, Tamil rebels have been fighting for a separate Tamil homeland in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, an island dominated by ethnic Sinhalese. Since the mid-1980's, the Tigers -- secretive and radically leftist -- have eliminated all moderate rivals and raised the level of violence with suicide bombings and assassinations. These have decimated a generation of Sri Lankan leaders from both ethnic groups and cost the Tigers support internationally and even among Tamils.</p>
        <p>In December, President Chandrika Kumaratunga lost the sight in one eye in a bomb attack. Under her administration, the army pushed the Tigers out of Jaffna five years ago, inflicting bombing raids and retaliatory ground attacks on Tamil civilians, human rights groups say. The Tigers retook the crucial pass connecting the Jaffna peninsula to the rest of Sri Lanka in May.</p>
        <p>The rebels have suffered considerable losses in recent months -- as many as 1,500 dead of a core army of 7,000, the Tamil human rights group said. They are seeking replacements for the assault on Jaffna, the group said, and meanwhile feed themselves by seizing food aid intended for civilians.</p>
        <p>The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which the United States put on its list of terrorist organizations, raises money to buy arms, often coercively, from a Tamil diaspora in Southeast Asia, Canada and Britain, among other places. But, if attempted, the overseas recruitment of fighters has apparently not been so easy.</p>
        <p>The Tigers need many more recruits for an attempt at taking Jaffna.</p>
        <p>''Teachers who try to protect the children from recruiters are marked,'' the University Teachers said. The group has operated underground since the assassination in 1988 of its founder, Dr. Rajani Thiranagama of Jaffna University's medical faculty.</p>
        <p>The report mentioned torture, public and secret executions and the chaining of young prisoners to bunkers when they try to leave the ranks.</p>
        <p>''Girls have been in a large majority in the current round of recruitment in schools,'' said the report, which told of a 15-year-old girl who escaped from the rebels and ran home, where her father hid her and armed himself with the only weapon he could find, a shark jawbone, to prevent her recapture. The daughter was apparently left alone.</p>
        <p>The pressure on children recently has been greatest in a region known as the Vanni, south of the Jaffna peninsula. It is the base of the Tigers' leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran, a reclusive strategist who, the Jaffna group says, has begun referring to himself as the Sun God. In April last year, he ordered compulsory military training for schoolchildren.</p>
        <p>The report told of one school where only four children in the 14-15 age group were recruited before April 1999. From then until early this year, 15 children were recruited. The number jumped to 24 in seven weeks from early May until late June. The pattern in other schools was similar, the report said. The report figures that only about 5 percent of child soldiers volunteer; the rest are taken with varying degrees of coercion.</p>
        <p>''Of the 15 who joined between April 1999 and early 2000, the bodies of six were brought to their school for display before being laid to rest,'' the report said of the one school. ''This ceremony is intended to give the dead an aura of heroism and to make others guilty about not joining.''</p>
