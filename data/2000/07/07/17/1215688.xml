        <p>ALLAMUCHY TOWNSHIP: ATHLETES INJURED  Eight high school football players and two adults suffered minor injuries yesterday when a car rammed the back of their bus, causing it to roll over on Route 80 in Warren County, the police said. The car's driver, Michael V. Ferraro, 60, of Nesconset, N.Y., who is believed to have been drunk, was traveling west and fell asleep at the wheel about 8:40 a.m., swerving his car into the bus. The bus was carrying players from Jericho, N.Y., to a summer football camp. One of them suffered a severed finger, the state police said. Mr. Ferraro, who was not injured, was charged with driving while intoxicated and careless driving, the authorities said.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGES FOR TROOPERS  A judge has refused to dismiss charges of attempted murder against two state troopers stemming from a 1998 shooting on the New Jersey Turnpike. The troopers, James Kenna and John Hogan, wounded three of four unarmed men -- two black, one Hispanic -- on April 23, 1998. The troopers have pleaded innocent, saying they opened fire when the van backed toward them. In an opinion issued Thursday, a judge rejected defense arguments that news accounts had prejudiced the grand jury.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: STABBING DEATH  An immigrant from Ivory Coast was fatally stabbed yesterday outside a TriBeCa nightclub, the police said. They said the man, Ibrahaim Conde, who is thought to have been in his 20's, was arguing with another man in the Kilimanjaro Club at Broadway and Leonard Street. The fight was broken up, but when Mr. Conde left the club at 4:15 a.m., he was attacked on the street by several men and stabbed repeatedly, the police said. He died at St. Vincents Hospital.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: HELP FOR EX-PATIENTS  Public Advocate Mark Green, left, called on Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday to dramatically increase housing and other services for former residents of state mental institutions. The state has greatly reduced the population of its psychiatric hospitals in the last four decades, but has not lived up to a promise to invest savings into services that help former patients live independently, Mr. Green said. Roger Klingman, a spokesman for the New York State Office of Mental Health, said $4.3 billion in local, state and federal money was spent yearly on mental health in New York, more than in any other state.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: TEENAGER FOUND  A mentally handicapped French teenager who was reported missing on Saturday evening was found four hours later. The boy, Gregoire Madignier, 16, was unharmed. His father, Pierre Madignier, had boarded a subway train at 53rd Street and Lexington Avenue when he realized that his son had remained on the platform. The teenager was found around 10 p.m. in front of 52 East End Avenue by police officers on patrol.</p>

        <p>BROOKHAVEN: REACTOR TO BE CLOSED  A small nuclear reactor used in experimental cancer research at Brookhaven National Laboratory will be closed by January because of discouraging clinical trials, John H. Marburger, the laboratory director, said last week. Dr. Marburger said the treatment the reactor explored, called boron neutron capture therapy, had proved difficult to put into practice, which prompted the Department of Energy to cut financing.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: ARAB WRITER ADMITS STONE-THROWING  Edward Said, the Palestinian writer and Columbia University professor, has admitted he threw stones at Israel's border fence -- but he said it was a harmless act of joy. Mr. Said was photographed this month among the daily throng of Lebanese who celebrate Israel's May withdrawal by stoning the fence. Israel has called on Lebanese authorities to properly police the area. In a July 6 statement faxed Wednesday to The Associated Press in Jerusalem, Mr. Said wrote, ''Much is now made of an incident that is basically trivial, as if that could ever outweigh the work I have done over 35 years on behalf of justice and peace.''</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: BENEFITS FOR DEPUTIES  State health insurance benefits will be extended to deputy sheriffs who work an average of at least 20 hours a week, Gov. John G. Rowland announced on Thursday. The deputies agreed to suspend contract negotiations until November, when a voter referendum will decide hether or not to abolish the office of high sheriff and assign the deputies' current duties to the Department of Correction and the Judicial Branch.</p>
