        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your series ''How Race Is Lived in America'':</p>
        <p>Despite the rhetoric about race and discrimination in this country, there is little discussion of two fundamental concepts: Separatism and discrimination are based on a perception of difference, and difference can be based on anything. In this country the major issue is race. In other countries it is religion or tribal affiliation. At its core is the ''us versus them'' mentality, which is as old as life itself. Why are we surprised if our uneasiness with ''the other'' is not easily laid to rest?</p>
        <p>Legislation is critical, but I often wonder, How can our society ever progress toward being colorblind if we characterize every social problem in terms of race (or sex or sexual orientation)? At what point does the expectation of bias on the part of ''the other'' become a self-fulfilling prophecy?</p>
