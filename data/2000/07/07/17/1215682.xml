        <p>The Knicks began to trim their roster yesterday by cutting three players, including the former Seton Hall point guard Shaheen Holloway, before departing for Boston to begin play in the Shaw's Pro Summer League tonight.

        <p>The Knicks began to trim their roster yesterday by cutting three players, including the former Seton Hall point guard Shaheen Holloway, before departing for Boston to begin play in the Shaw's Pro Summer League tonight. But the team is still waiting for the one player who has been missing throughout the rookie camp: Frederic Weis.</p>
        <p>Weis, the Knicks' first-round draft pick last year, was scheduled to fly yesterday to New York, where he was supposed to have a physical and then join the team in Boston. But when Weis's flight landed at Kennedy Airport without the 7-foot-2-inch center on board, the Knicks began to wonder again just when they would see him.</p>
        <p>''We've had conflicting reports,'' said Frank Catapano, Weis's agent in the United States. ''According to Didier Rose, his European agent, he got all the information to leave on Saturday and was taking the plane this morning. But the Knicks called me and said that they had no confirmation that he was on the plane.''</p>
        <p>Weis played in France last season after struggling through the summer league with the Knicks. He was expected to arrive in New York on June 27 but remained in France because his father was ill. He told the Knicks he would arrive on July 5 to begin working with the coaching staff, and then was expected to arrive in time for the start of the rookie camp, which began last Wednesday. Finally, the Knicks expected he would be on the flight yesterday.</p>
        <p>After the rookie camp, the Knicks reduced the number of players who will play in Boston to 14.</p>
        <p>Holloway was not drafted this year after spraining his left ankle in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. He finished as Seton Hall's career assists leader and was a co-winner of the Big East's most improved player award last season.</p>
        <p>The Knicks also released Marcus Wilson, a 6-3 guard from Evansville, and Kipp Christianson, a 7-0 center from St. John's University of Minnesota.</p>
