        <p>Tens of thousands of Jewish settlers demonstrated here tonight against the Israeli government's peace negotiations, capping days of rightist protests against leaked proposals to cede small Israeli settlements deep in the West Bank and Gaza to eventual Palestinian control.</p>
        <p>The predominantly religious crowd chanted slogans of resistance to any relocation of Jews from the occupied territories. Many wore blue-and-white lapel stickers saying, ''We are the majority.'' Yet the gathering barely filled Rabin Square, falling far short of organizers' expressed hopes for 200,000 or more protesters. The police gave no official crowd estimate.</p>
        <p>Organizers had vowed to make the rally a nonpartisan appeal for mainstream Israeli support. But it soon became vigorously and unabashedly partisan, with the opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, and other Likud Party officials demanding that Prime Minister Ehud Barak quit the Camp David negotiations and return home.</p>
        <p>''I call on the prime minister: do not sign a letter of capitulation,'' Mr. Sharon shouted to the crowd.</p>
        <p>Not all of the speakers were political professionals. ''Everyone understands that giving everything and receiving nothing is not peace,'' declared Yehuda Sender, an 8-year-old from a Gaza Strip settlement, in a speech he told television interviewers had been written by the leader of the settlers' council.</p>
        <p>The rally reinforced the impression that the right wing has been more energetic in organizing opposition to a peace deal than the left has been in mobilizing potential backing.</p>
        <p>In the Palestinian territories, Yasir Arafat's supporters have been holding marches of support almost daily, most recently this morning in Nablus.</p>
        <p>Still, leftist organizers of a peace demonstration planned for Mr. Barak's return said they were heartened that tonight's rally failed to attract many secular supporters from within Israel.</p>
        <p>Rachel and Chaim Guirtzman were typical of the protesters tonight. They are observant Jews who moved with 30 other families 15 years ago into a new West Bank settlement -- Dolev, outside Ramallah. The site was barren land, Mr. Guirtzman said.</p>
        <p>Dolev is now a modern township of 150 families surrounded by five newer settler communities.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Guirtzman said she read reports that sovereignty in settlements may be transferred to a Palestinian state. ''We didn't build our settlements to live in a foreign country,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The contrast between the two Israels was starkly visible in the demonstrators' modest dress and covered heads. Many came from West Bank and Gaza towns that are as little as an hour away by road, but a world away culturally. Local residents in this zealously secular downtown district either ignored the out-of-towners or eyed them with disdain.</p>
        <p>''They think like Khomeini and people like that,'' muttered Motti Shanma, a contrast in his straw cowboy hat and muscle shirt, his tattooed arms flexing as he diced vegetables behind a lunch counter. ''They cannot imagine the possibility of peace in this country.''</p>
        <p>Some protesters agreed with that assertion. ''Barak is giving away our land, peace by peace,'' proclaimed a placard in English hoisted aloft by Millie Fried, from Flatbush, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Fried acknowledged her residence defensively -- ''My heart is here,'' she said -- but claimed solid personal credentials for her protest. In 1970, as a 15-year-old, she said, she was a passenger on a TWA flight from Tel Aviv to New York that was hijacked by Palestinians and diverted to Amman. A week on board as a hostage, she said, convinced her that Israel is under threat and should keep its conquered territory.</p>
        <p>''Israel belongs to the Jews, every inch of it,'' she said, ''and we are not going to let it go.''</p>
