        <p>I am a white man who lived in Hawaii for three years. For the first time in my life, after having been raised in an upper-middle-class white neighborhood on the mainland, I was no longer a member of the majority but just one of many in an ethnic hodgepodge of people.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your series ''How Race Is Lived in America'':</p>
        <p>I am a white man who lived in Hawaii for three years. For the first time in my life, after having been raised in an upper-middle-class white neighborhood on the mainland, I was no longer a member of the majority but just one of many in an ethnic hodgepodge of people.</p>
        <p>Did I have advantages there as a white person that someone else may not have had? Probably. Hawaii is not perfect. The disadvantage of the native Hawaiians is an example of Hawaii's imperfections.</p>
        <p>On the mainland, asking someone about his ethnicity is taken as an insult. In Hawaii, that question is asked as an introduction, out of interest in a person's family and culture. Now that I live on the mainland, I admit that I am much more conscious of race. I seek out ''my kind.'' In Hawaii, I sought out diversity.  America, and its polarity, does that to us all.</p>
