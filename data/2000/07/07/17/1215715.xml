        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Bricks, Mortar and Coalition Building'' (''How Race Is Lived in America,'' front page, July 13):</p>
        <p>You report that Brian G. Smith, a black man who owns a construction-management company, ''finds his dealings with white-owned companies to be 'really something.' ''</p>
        <p>You add: ''He is asked absurd questions . . . like whether he offers employee benefits. 'They think you work out of your house,' he said.''</p>
        <p>As a white female business owner, I've stopped counting the times when I've been asked by potential clients, vendors and others if I work out of my house. I've never figured out if it's asked because I work in a creative field (graphic design), or if it just appears that I effortlessly juggle motherhood and business, but the question is always irksome. I remain curious about what other unasked questions and preconceptions are carried into business encounters with enterprises owned by women and members of minority groups. Mr. Smith's experiences resonated with me.</p>
