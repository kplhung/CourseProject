        <p>Underscoring the effects of a rapidly aging population, low birthrates and skyrocketing fiscal deficits in Japan, the prime minister's tax advisory council released a report on Friday that strongly suggested tax increases are necessary if the country is to avoid financial disaster.</p>
        <p>The Tax Commission recommended lowering the minimum income level at which taxes begin, raising sales taxes and forcing even the 60 percent of Japanese corporations that report losses to pay local taxes based on their size rather than their profitability.</p>
        <p>It noted that corporate tax rates have fallen to levels comparable to those in the United States and that Japan's income tax revenue is among the lowest in major industrialized countries. At 5 percent, Japan's sales tax is also one of the lowest among its economic peers, the report said.</p>
        <p>The report poses a problem for the Japanese government, which has struggled for the last decade to get the economy back on its feet after the burst of the asset bubble that marked Japan's heady ascent in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>''We think Japan faces a policy bind -- no matter what you do, you wind up creating problems in other areas,'' Vincent J. Truglia, co-head of sovereign risk at Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency, told Bloomberg News on Friday. Moody's is considering another downgrade of Japan's credit rating.</p>
        <p>The report is not binding. But the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax panel, which makes policy, has in the past made its revisions to the tax code in line with the Tax Commission's reports.</p>
        <p>The implications of the report are sobering. Higher individual taxes would hurt spending, which accounts for some 60 percent of economic activity here at a time when policy makers are heavily relying on consumption to fuel Japan's sputtering economic recovery.</p>
        <p>That will no doubt come under discussion on Monday when the Bank of Japan's policy board meets. Economists have placed even odds that the board will vote to increase interest rates, abandoning its policy of maintaining rates at virtually zero.</p>
        <p>But the prospect of higher taxes combined with rising interest rates would most likely choke whatever economic revival is under way. An increase in the consumption tax a few years ago slammed the brakes on what was shaping up as a mild economic recovery, a memory that remains especially painful for the Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>In fact, the report is somewhat embarrassing for the party, which criticized the opposition Democratic Party for suggesting during parliamentary elections last month that taxes must rise.</p>
        <p>The report's recommendations stand in stark contrast to steps other countries are taking to reduce the tax burdens on their citizens.</p>
        <p>The same day that the Tax Commission released its report, Germany enacted a package of tax reforms intended to enhance the competitiveness of its industries.</p>
        <p>That package is likely to push Germany's neighbors to adopt more liberal tax policies, which would leave Japan to buck the trend alone among the major industrialized nations.</p>
        <p>But Japan's problems, while not singular, are more exacerbated than those of its biggest trading partners. The Japanese population is aging far more rapidly and its birthrate falling more rapidly than in any other country, and its efforts to spend its way out of a decadelong economic downturn, rather than adopting more painful structural remedies, has left it with the highest deficit of any industrialized country.</p>
        <p>Japan's tax revenue covers less than half its expenditures, and thus the Organization for Economic Development estimates that Japan's debts will exceed its gross domestic product by almost 18 percent this year. In contrast, Germany's debt stands at 63 percent of gross domestic product and the United States' at 51.7 percent.</p>
