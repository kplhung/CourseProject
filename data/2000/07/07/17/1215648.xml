        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>A group of 10-year-old girls from the Manhattan Soccer Club's traveling teams gathered recently at the home of Coach Bob Bodian to make plans for a new team they will be fielding this fall. The agenda highlight for the girls was deciding on a new team name.</p>
        <p>Simeon Baum, the manager of the team, decided that names would be nominated and winnowed down through rounds of balloting. Conventional names like Cyclone, Hurricane and Comets kept dropping and in came names -- Tsunami, Dunkin' Donuts, Slickers -- that nobody was really enthusiastic about.</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>A group of 10-year-old girls from the Manhattan Soccer Club's traveling teams gathered recently at the home of Coach Bob Bodian to make plans for a new team they will be fielding this fall. The agenda highlight for the girls was deciding on a new team name.</p>
        <p>Simeon Baum, the manager of the team, decided that names would be nominated and winnowed down through rounds of balloting. Conventional names like Cyclone, Hurricane and Comets kept dropping and in came names -- Tsunami, Dunkin' Donuts, Slickers -- that nobody was really enthusiastic about.</p>
        <p>Simeon reluctantly decided to restart the process with a new round of nominations and found himself besieged by the clamor of 15 girls screaming to be heard over one another. ''Girls, girls,'' he cried. ''This is chaos!''</p>
        <p>Bingo! This fall, Manhattan Chaos will uphold the pride of New York City and all that it stands for.</p>

        <p>''This was one of the funnier things I've heard in my 15 years as a restaurateur,'' reported Danny Meyer, the co-owner of Gramercy Tavern.</p>
        <p>One night, toward the end of the Knicks' futile playoff run, a man telephoned asking confirmation that the Knicks game would be turned on at the bar during his scheduled dinner at Gramercy Tavern. ''I'm sorry,'' the reservations clerk replied. ''We have no television sets at the restaurant.''</p>
        <p>''But it says you do in the Zagat Survey,'' the caller replied. ''That's why I picked your restaurant in the first place.'' The puzzled clerk asked, ''Where does the Zagat Survey say we have a TV?''</p>
        <p>''It's right here on Page 229,'' the caller replied. ''You're one of the places recommended for game in season.''</p>
        <p>Kathleen Finn and her husband, Neal, were crossing Third Avenue during the rush hour when they noticed a well-dressed man standing in the street, hailing a cab. A large truck started to back up directly in his path, and, because of the noise, the man did not hear the truck's warning bell or Mr. Finn's warning yell. Mr. Finn then ran over to the man and, lifting him by the lapels on his coat, carried him out of danger.</p>
        <p>The man, realizing what had happened, called out, ''You saved my life.'' Not so unusual, you might say, but Mr. Finn just celebrated his 75th birthday.</p>
        <p>Overheard in a Deal, N.J., beauty salon by Emily Korb:</p>
        <p>First woman: ''I'm here for the summer. Give me a call.''</p>
        <p>Second woman: ''You're a renter. I own. Call me.''</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>A couple of weeks ago, my wife, Sarah, and I and our new Mercury were looking for a parking space on 62nd Street at Second Avenue. We found a parking meter and as I searched my pockets I found that all I had were nickels and dimes, no quarters.</p>
        <p>I approached a young lady walking by and told her of my problem. She took out a handful of quarters, said, ''Take as many as you want,'' and refused my nickels and dimes in exchange. ''Be my guest,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As this young lady was leaving the scene, another young man approached and shoved two quarters in my hand and walked away.</p>
        <p>Of course, my wife and I are over 80. Our hats are off to the young people of New York.</p>

        <p>AN 11-YEAR-OLD'S WISH</p>
        <p>I wish that money grew on trees and God could talk to you.</p>
        <p>I wish that I could fly high into the sky to play in the clouds.</p>
        <p>I wish that every food was good for you except beans.</p>
        <p>I wish that people would be nice to one another and that there was no such thing as war.</p>
        <p>I wish that we would have less homework.</p>
        <p>I wish that there was no such thing as being popular, and that everybody was equal with friends.</p>
        <p>I wish that there was less school.</p>
        <p>I wish my cat could talk because I want to know her thoughts.</p>

        <p>Anne Rotenberg was sitting in the laundry room of her Forest Hills apartment, waiting for her wash to finish, when she was joined by a little girl about 3 years old and a woman, apparently the family housekeeper. Ms. Rotenberg complimented the child on how pretty she looked with her new glasses and noted that her own glasses did not make her look very pretty.</p>
        <p>The little girl nodded in agreement but added, without missing a beat, ''But when you'll be little, I'll give you mine.''</p>
        <p>Advice from a 30-something father to his 3-something son, overheard by Ronnie Hammer at the Bronx Zoo's Flamingo Pub:</p>
        <p>''Now Jason, don't eat all those fries first. It's important to have a well-balanced meal. Take a few bites of your pizza, too!''</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Edith Loss, a fellow dog lover, and her husband, Robert Sukup, took their 18-year-old Norwich terrier to their longtime vet to help them make an inevitable decision. The terrier had been deaf, blind and incontinent for some time.</p>
        <p>While her husband took the dog into the vet's office, Edith stayed in the car, unable to face the music. A young woman walked by with two dogs, the two talked dogs for a few minutes and Edith then mentioned the sad errand she and her husband were on. The conversation ended.</p>
        <p>As her husband emerged from the office, Edith spotted her new acquaintance walking back down the street with a bouquet of flowers. She presented them, kissed both grieving ''parents'' and expressed her sorrow at their sorrow. Edith has always believed in the kindness of New Yorkers, and what a wonderful way to have that belief confirmed.</p>

        <p>DILEMMA</p>
        <p>I sit in the theater and ponder</p>
        <p>At Broadway's perpetual riddle:</p>
        <p>Why do aisle-sitters contrive to come first</p>
        <p>To be trampled by those in the middle?</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Last year I received a talking clock for a birthday present. When the alarm goes off, you can hear the crowing of a rooster -- cock-a-doodle-doo. A few weeks ago, I noticed the crow was hardly audible and was told that the battery had to be replaced. The clerk in the appliance store changed the battery and put the clock in a large brown bag.</p>
        <p>I got on a very crowded bus in midafternoon and stood near the driver, holding onto the pole. The bus swerved, the bag hit the pole and the alarm -- COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO -- went off, full strength with that new battery. I tried to turn it off but the lever was so small I couldn't see it so the alarm just continued as everyone on the bus looked on, laughing.</p>
        <p>As I got off, the driver put in his two cents: ''Next time, please leave your rooster at home,'' he said.</p>
