        <p>As traffic sweeps north on Mound Road, past the Detroit newspapers' printing plant, the air horns of some passing semitrailer trucks offer supportive blasts to the cluster of picketing newspaper workers. Other drivers offer staccato salutes on their car horns.</p>
        <p>But the noise is irregular at best, as most cars and trucks speed silently by. On its fifth anniversary, the last great newspaper strike of the 20th century, a ghost with a living grievance, still haunts Detroit, but the city moves on.</p>
        <p>If the strike is a memory, though, its consequences are not. Since the walkout on July 13, 1995, Detroit's two daily papers have operated with replacement workers and, eventually, many returning strikers.</p>
        <p>But a union-led boycott has helped erode the daily circulations of the morning paper, The Detroit Free Press, and the evening Detroit News, by a third. Between 1995 and 1999, the two newspapers lost paying customers eight times faster than the industry as a whole.</p>
        <p>The various union chapters, meanwhile, have seen their memberships dwindle. And on July 7, in a further blow to the Newspaper Guild of Detroit, a federal appeals panel overturned the National Labor Relations Board and ruled that the papers' managers had not engaged in unfair labor practices by adopting a merit-pay system.</p>
        <p>Besides ending expectations that strikers would receive millions of dollars in back pay, the ruling stripped the union loyalists of the judicial support that had seemed to give them the moral high ground. ''We feel the legal system failed us,'' said Louis Mleczko, the guild's president.</p>
        <p>Given the bitterness, management knows that winning back many readers will require ending the boycott by settling with the six striking unions, and by finding ways to manage newsrooms and mailrooms and printing presses with workers who once cursed each other across picket lines.</p>
        <p>''It's incredibly tragic that the unions and companies couldn't come to some middle ground,'' said David Crumm, a religion writer for The Free Press. ''As it is, we've educated a whole generation of readers that they don't need to read our newspapers. So we all lose.''</p>
        <p>Can the mutual antipathy be overcome, allowing the unions to call off the boycott, before the subscriber erosion is so great that one newspaper or the other must fold? Will Detroit, like so many other cities, be left with one major daily? Or will the digital technology that has streamlined costs -- and helped render the picket lines impotent -- let the papers find new ways to market themselves, keeping them healthy?</p>
        <p>The News, owned by the Gannett Company, had daily circulation of 359,000 in 1994, the year the paper won a Pulitzer Prize for exposing fiscal mismanagement in state government. Now its daily circulation is only about 237,000.</p>
        <p>The News' competitor, Knight Ridder's Free Press, ranked ninth nationally in March 1994, with a daily circulation of 551,000. Six years later, it sells only 361,000 daily copies and ranks 22nd.</p>
        <p>Asked if both papers will still exist in five years, Frank J. Vega, the Gannett executive who is president of the Detroit Newspaper Agency, which runs the business operations of both newspapers, confidently predicts they will. ''We need to get contracts now,'' Mr. Vega said. ''We want to get contracts. The unions want to get contracts. But it's going to be difficult to get it done. They want to turn the clock back.'' Last week, Mr. Vega rescinded proposals the agency had made in informal bargaining.</p>
        <p>His office is filled with strike memorabilia, like the hate-filled cards he has defiantly framed and a Darth Vader statue, memorializing the strikers' epithet, ''Darth Vega.''</p>
        <p>''There have been strikes that were more violent; there have been strikes that went on longer,'' Mr. Vega said. ''But we probably have a lock on this: this will be the longest, in terms of the time it's going to take to heal.''</p>
        <p>The strike was called in July 1995 a week after management put in place a merit-pay system over union objections. In the early days of the strike, both newspapers published under a joint masthead. A rival paper, The Detroit Journal, was published by the strikers for four years. By the end of 1995, The News and The Free Press resumed separate publication, although some advertisers and many readers shunned them.</p>
        <p>The strike lasted formally for 19 months, until the six unions agreed to return to work. The advertisers, too, have returned. But no contracts have been signed.</p>
        <p>And vivid memories linger. The burning truck. The picketer hit by a delivery truck. The bruises left from clashes with riot police. The stalking of replacement delivery workers, the epithets, the fury, the hatred.</p>
        <p>For the strikers, it was a just fight for collective bargaining and workers' rights. For Mr. Vega, it was a just fight against a bloated payroll and an arrogant union leadership that led more than 2,000 workers into the wilderness for no good reason.</p>
        <p>The News and The Free Press are now staffed by replacement workers and former strikers, with a total of 1,478 full-time jobs -- 766 fewer than  before the strike. It is a more efficient and more ethnically diverse work force, Mr. Vega said.</p>
        <p>All sides agree that Gannett and Knight Ridder, which formed the Detroit Newspaper Agency under a joint operating agreement in 1989, together lost more than $100 million in the strike. But the profit picture improved at the end of 1996. Analysts say the agency's profits climbed to between $60 million and $70 million in 1999, surpassing 1994 levels.</p>
        <p>The agency took in almost $350 million in advertising revenue last year, according to the estimates of a Merrill Lynch analyst, Lauren Rich Fine. That was almost $80 million more than in 1996. Ms. Fine said the strike had not hurt the two companies with investors: ''They did what they had to do. They are happy where they ended up.''</p>
        <p>But Jim St. Louis ended up without his old job as a mailroom worker. He is now an organizer for the Teamsters' International Union. Like people on both sides, he clings to memories that seem to support the justness of his actions, like the visit of Martin Luther King III in support of the strike.</p>
        <p>Different unions had different issues. The Newspaper Guild objected to the merit-pay plan leaving most annual pay raises to management's discretion. For the mailers, it was disputes over pay and the use of subcontractors. For drivers and circulations workers, job security.</p>
        <p>Now, union membership is way down. In 1995, Teamsters Local 2040 had 365 full-time workers and 300 part-time workers at the newspaper agency, according to its president, Al Young. Now he said, only 165 pay dues and just 68 are back at work.</p>
        <p>In 1995, the Newspaper Guild of Detroit had 600 dues-paying members -- reporters, photographers, copy editors and janitors. Now there are 235.</p>
        <p>Robert G. McGruder, who was the managing editor of The Free Press at the time of the strike and is now its executive editor, said he felt vindicated by the panel's ruling. ''But I didn't think it symbolized a victory or the end of a difficult situation,'' he said. ''There's a long, long road to go to negotiate fair contracts.''</p>
        <p>And a long road to winning back readers. Yet, even some labor loyalists, among the first to desert the paper, have begun to trickle back. Bob Celestini, a retired test driver for Chrysler, said he had stopped subscribing to The News in late 1995 but started buying it again last year: ''I threw my hands up. It was a deadlock.''</p>
        <p>Mark Silverman, who became publisher of The News in mid-1997, said that circulation figures did not represent the paper's full reach. He said a survey in January showed that of the paper's total readership, 21 percent did not buy the paper themselves but read someone else's copy. That compares with an 8 percent pass-along readership before the strike, he said.</p>
        <p>Melvin Small, a history professor at Wayne State University, is part of the pass-along group. He subscribes to The Oakland Press, a suburban daily. But if he finds The Free Press ''in an airplane seat, I'll pick it up and read it,'' Mr. Small said, although he added, ''my wife won't.''</p>
        <p>And a few Democratic politicians like Congressman David E. Bonior and some city council members, along with scholars like Professor Small, some clergymen and union leaders, still will not talk to reporters from The Free Press and The News.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Robert Giles, the senior vice president of the Freedom Forum who was the editor and publisher of The News when the strike began, now finds his candidacy to become curator of Harvard University's Nieman Foundation under attack by union leaders. His critics contend that Mr. Giles distorted the News's coverage of the strike to favor management's viewpoint; they recall an article about a group of four civic honorees, which mentioned three award winners and omitted the name of a prominent striker.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giles has received a letter of support from the current leaders of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, calling him ''an innovative and ethical journalist.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Giles defended The News' strike coverage as being fair, considering that ''the union spokespeople would not speak to our reporters.'' As for the article that omitted the name of a striker, he said he did not know that had happened and that the name should have been included.</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Giles said: ''The Detroit newspapers were able to introduce what we consider to be modern newspaper management practices. That fact alone will be seen years from now as being a very important part of the survival of two newspapers in Detroit.'' But, he added, ''the emotional toll was extraordinary.''</p>
        <p>Michael Wowk, a suburban reporter at The News, believes the strike failed because ''they outmuscled us.'' At 53, he is training to become a schoolteacher, and he said his current managers accommodated his scheduling needs. But still, when he thinks of editors and reporters who crossed the picket line, he said: ''I don't know if everything will ever be forgiven. But we're professionals. We work together.''</p>
