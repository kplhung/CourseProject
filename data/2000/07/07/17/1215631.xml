        <p>BEFORE the fat lady began singing for Internet retailers in nearly every category, the term ''customer acquisition costs'' meant little to most Web merchants.

        <p>Now, though, e-tailers recognize customer acquisition numbers as one of the vital signs they will have to monitor with the watchfulness of an intensive care nurse if they are to survive their brushes with fiscal mortality.</p>

        <p>BEFORE the fat lady began singing for Internet retailers in nearly every category, the term ''customer acquisition costs'' meant little to most Web merchants. It was common to spend $100 or more chasing down a customer, even though that person might never buy enough in a lifetime to return the $100.</p>
        <p>Now, though, e-tailers recognize customer acquisition numbers as one of the vital signs they will have to monitor with the watchfulness of an intensive care nurse if they are to survive their brushes with fiscal mortality.</p>
        <p>No one knows what customer acquisition number will ultimately work for most Internet merchants, but it is safe to say that the figure is a lot closer to zero than the current industry level of about $80. Fortunately, a marketing technique that is not widely practiced in the bricks-and-mortar retail world is providing hope. Known as reciprocal marketing, it allows companies to offer their paying customers discounts at other online retailers. Despite potential  pitfalls, many of the merchants involved in these programs say they have been able to attract new customers at little expense.</p>
        <p>To the consumer, these efforts look a bit like chain-letter e-commerce.</p>
        <p>Spend $40 at eToys, for instance, and get a gift certificate for $10 at Gap.com. Spend $40 at Gap.com and get a $10 gift certificate at ProFlowers.com. And so on. The number of Internet merchants using reciprocal marketing is not yet large enough to link a broad array of e-tailers together. But the increasing consolidation of the e-tailing market and the growing popularity of the reciprocal programs could eventually make them pervasive.</p>
        <p>For instance, ProFlowers.com, an online florist, will probably expand its reciprocal marketing program to include companies other than Gap .com, said Steven Bellach, the company's chief marketing officer. ''These kinds of deals are the way the Internet will be working, going forward,'' Mr. Bellach said. ''The beauty of it is that no cash changes hands'' between the merchants, he said. ''And you get people when their wallets are still open.''</p>
        <p>In the ProFlowers and Gap.com program, customers who made a purchase of any size from ProFlowers this spring received $10 off of any purchase at Gap.com. Customers of Gap.com who spent $40 or more received a discount of $10 from ProFlowers. As with many other companies engaged in such programs, ProFlowers and Gap sent follow-up e-mails to their customers, including a coupon number for redemption at the other site.</p>
        <p>ProFlowers saw the effort as a way to increase sales -- in that case, Mother's Day sales. But the company had other uses for the program. Because flower orders for Mother's Day typically come in on the Friday before the holiday, and because a flood of 11th-hour orders would cripple the delivery system, Mr. Bellach said, the company gave the Gap.com discount only to customers who ordered from the ProFlowers.com site in time for a delivery no later than the Thursday before Mother's Day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bellach declined to share specifics about the number of deliveries diverted to Thursday or before, ''but the program was very successful for us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>E-tailers who engage in reciprocal marketing deals said choosing a partner was the most difficult part. Merchants said they typically searched for companies outside their category, of course, but with well-known and highly regarded brands, with extensive customer-service capabilities.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people are trying to build as many relationships with retailers as they can, but there's a very fine line,'' said Lloyd Cheu, vice president for strategic planning at Vitamin Shoppe.com, an online seller of health supplies, which has a reciprocal marketing program with Barnes andNoble.com (www.bn.com). ''You have to be very careful about how you share the customer with other people,'' Mr. Cheu said, ''and what happens to them on that other site.''</p>
        <p>Cluttering the home page of a site with discounts to a dozen other retailers could also be risky, executives said, as customers could begin confusing the company with an online mall. Mr. Cheu said his site  would soon be able to tailor the offers of other companies to a customer's buying habits on his site.</p>
        <p>Such tailored offers will enable reciprocal marketing agreements to become much more useful to consumers, said Carrie Johnson, an analyst with Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm. ''What will be neat is if you buy a book about gardening at BarnesandNoble.com, and get a link to ProFlowers.com to buy the kind of flowers you bought the book about,'' she said. ''At that point, these companies will be serving a complete need, not just dumping off the consumer to other retailers.''</p>
        <p>Carl Rosendorf, senior vice president of BarnesandNoble.com, said the company could not yet aim its offers with such precision. But he said the reciprocal marketing effort, which began in January, was evolving in other ways.</p>
        <p>BarnesandNoble.com actually has two separate programs -- one on its Internet site, and one on its bookselling service on America Online. In both cases, customers who complete their orders are greeted with a page showing discounts available at eight Internet merchants.</p>
        <p>Merchants on the Barnesand Noble.com Web site pay nothing for the privilege, but must deliver an agreed-upon number of their own customers to the BarnesandNoble site. Under the AOL arrangement, by contrast, BarnesandNoble charges participating merchants $55 for every 1,000 customers who see the offer.</p>
        <p>''That's been an absolute grand slam home run for us,'' Mr. Rosendorf said. ''There's a waiting list of companies that want to get on with us.''</p>
        <p>He added that the company would begin using the pay-per-thousand approach on its own Web site this fall.</p>
        <p>With a few exceptions, reciprocal marketing agreements have made little headway among traditional retailers. One reason, executives said, is that it would be difficult to monitor  a co-marketing program in 1,000 stores around the nation, with store managers who might not be thrilled to take up valuable counter space with offers from other companies.</p>
        <p>Online retailers say they were not eager to pursue agreements with off line merchants for the same reason. But at least one such relationship, between eToys and Gap stores, has paid off. The companies have completed two such programs since November, with the eToys.com site featuring offers to Gap and Gap.com, and Gap.com and Gap stores returning the favor.</p>
        <p>Notably, the Gap stores displayed signs in key store locations, including the cash register. Janine Bousquette, the chief marketing officer for eToys, said there were few problems in conducting the program. ''One of the reasons we chose them was that they run a high-quality, disciplined in-store operation,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A Gap spokeswoman declined to comment on its co-marketing deals. And Ms. Bousquette would not disclose statistics about the effort, which she said tracked traffic, customer acquisition and the rate at which visitors made purchases.</p>
        <p>''We both felt that it was a very efficient way to drive business,'' Ms. Bousquette said.</p>
