        <p>One afternoon I was driving along the narrow dirt road on which I live. Ahead of me was a small red car with two people in the front seat.

        <p>One afternoon I was driving along the narrow dirt road on which I live. Ahead of me was a small red car with two people in the front seat. You can't go very fast on a dirt road, so we were poking along. As we did, I began to watch the car in front of me. The driver was a middle-aged man wearing glasses, and beside him sat a woman with long, wavy blond hair.</p>
        <p>I could see the man's face because he kept turning and talking to the woman, but I couldn't see her face because she never turned to look at him or answer.</p>
        <p>As we drove along, the man turned again and again, talking to the woman. He had thinning hair and a kindly face. Everything about him, his gestures, the way he spoke, seemed friendly and affectionate: he leaned toward her, he smiled. But she sat without movement or response, staring straight ahead. She never once looked in his direction, and I wondered why.</p>
        <p>I supposed of course that they were fighting. The long blond hair suggested someone who was beautiful, or anyway someone who invited admiration and was used to it. I thought she might be arrogant and imperious, coldhearted, the way a beautiful woman, spoiled by her beauty, can be. I thought that the man might be her husband, or her lover, and that he was pleading with her. I thought she was turning cold to him; perhaps she was ending things completely, and he was trying to win her back. I felt sorry for the man, who was trying so hard to reach her, to save things.</p>
        <p>We both slowed down to cross a little stone bridge, and once past it, on the straight, he turned again to her. I wondered then if I'd gotten it wrong. The man was definitely middle-aged, and the woman's long, thick blond hair suggested youth. Perhaps the man was not her husband but her father.</p>
        <p>Perhaps he was pleading with her about something else: maybe about her behavior toward her mother, for example, or her grades or her attitude in school. Maybe she was sitting sullenly still, not heartlessly. Or maybe it was something else: maybe she was not stony-faced and implacable or sullen, but miserable. Maybe she was weeping and unable to look at her father. Perhaps he was trying to comfort her for a young man's cruelty or some other terrible teenage disappointment.</p>
        <p>I watched them closely, trying to decipher the story. The man turned to her, smiling, tilting his head coaxingly. She still did not look at him. I felt sympathy for the man, making such a tender and dedicated effort; and sympathy for the woman, locked in such a paralyzed and miserable state.</p>
        <p>We reached the stop sign at the end of Mount Holly Road, and the man turned once more to the blond woman. This time, at last, she turned toward him. She leaned over and licked his nose. She was a golden retriever.</p>
        <p>The reason for this story is to give you some idea of what it's like to be a writer. How odd an occupation it is, how unpredictable and how humbling.</p>
        <p>I'm often asked when I started writing. But the important question is not when do writers start, but why.</p>
        <p>My own reasons for writing, for setting down the story, are to a large extent selfish. With each story -- and by story I mean anything I write -- I am trying simply to work something out for myself. You, the reader, play no part here: this is a private matter.</p>
        <p>I write about the things that trouble me. I write about the things that disturb me, the things that won't let me alone, the things that are eating slowly into my brain at 3 in the morning, the things that unbalance my world. Sometimes these are things I've said or done; sometimes they're things I've heard about or seen. Sometimes they're only sentences, sometimes scenes, sometimes complete narratives. I carry these things around inside my head until I'm compelled to write them down to get rid of them. I sit down and begin.</p>
        <p>I know where I'm going: I'm going toward that troubling moment, the unforgivable statement, the irreversible act that has been gnawing at me. That's what's coming at the end of the story, and my task is to write my way to that moment in a way that explains it completely to me. If I can set down these moments and make them whole within a context that explains the scene and characters whose behavior I can forgive, then the moments become comprehensible to me. When I understand them, they lose their power to disturb. Then the anxieties subside and let me sleep. I really write to free myself.</p>
        <p>As you can tell from the golden retriever, what I find most persistently interesting and compelling are stories about families. The family is at the heart of our emotional lives. It's where the heat is, the source of our most powerful feelings.</p>
        <p>Family connections -- between parent and child, brother and sister, husband and wife -- form the strongest bonds we will ever know. These are the people who can make us happier, and angrier, than anyone else on earth. And these connections are indestructible: you might reject your family members, you might refuse to see them ever again, but they will still be your family. You will always be a part of them, whether you choose to be or not. The family will always have formed you. That was your childhood, no matter what you wish.</p>
        <p>Your feelings for your family will be powerful ones, even if you deny them. If you were to decide, at 20, never to speak to your mother again, and if you didn't see your mother for 40 years, she would still be your mother. She would still have formed crucial parts of your sensibility.</p>
        <p>When you do see her 40 years later, by accident, as you surely will, when you catch a glimpse of her at someone's funeral, standing unevenly on the sloping lawn of the cemetery, grimly holding her pocketbook in the way you so well remember; or if you finally steel yourself and deliberately pay her a visit, in that first moment, as she opens the door and stands motionless in the doorway, silent, as though she doesn't know you. Then at that moment all those feelings that made you long ago decide never to see her again will come boiling up inside you.</p>
        <p>You can't escape: those early feelings run at full spate for your entire lifetime, even if you can't bear to think of them. Even if you refuse to acknowledge them, they are still there, pulsing and coursing below the surface, in silence and darkness, like an underground river. They govern our surface lives more than we think, and at any moment they may rise up from the darkness into full view, where they will explode into foam and torrents.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the best thing about the family is that all of the emotions within it depend upon love, which is the most powerful. All the darker ones -- rage and hatred and resentment -- result from the absence of love, or its withholding; but love is the prime mover. And the fact that love is a part of any emotional equation means that the emotional life is always fluid, always in a state of flux: 40 years of resentment can be ended, erased completely, if the love is at last forthcoming.</p>
        <p>Of course if love has been withheld for 40 years, the chances of its being freely given now are slim. It's just as likely that your father will turn his face to the wall and die, rather than speak to you at last. But something transforming might happen. He might speak. Or you might at last understand why he can't, and forgive him. You might feel the love you've missed, even if he cannot.</p>
        <p>As a subject, the family Is inexhaustible. Tolstoy is mistaken: all happy families are not alike. In fact no two families are alike, happy or unhappy. Every family, like every fingerprint, has its own unique pattern, its own set of conflicts and beliefs and alliances. They're formed by all sorts of things -- class, education, language and physical heredity, just for starters; and growing up within our own family, we assume that our experience and its behavior is the norm.</p>
        <p>We assume that a father always gets up first on Sunday morning and comes down in his dressing gown to make everyone breakfast. Or that a mother never takes the animals to the vet because she throws up at the smell. Or that during fights a mother always retreats into the bedroom closet and holds the door shut. These things, you assume, are given, they are fixed.</p>
        <p>Larger issues -- America as a democratic institution, whether we should support capital punishment -- these are in the arena of public discussion. You know people have a variety of attitudes toward them. You know how your fiance feels about those things because you've talked about them. You discover the other, more important things later. You don't find out about other families' patterns until you've married into them, and then you find yourself arguing, indignantly, with utter disbelief about who should cook breakfast on Sundays, or who should take the dog for his shots, or whether you should be shouting out these views from inside the bedroom closet.</p>
        <p>All this beauty and fury makes the family a rich literary source. Much of our greatest fiction comes from conflicts within it: look at ''Oedipus Rex,'' ''King Lear,'' ''Anna Karenina,'' ''The Sound and the Fury,'' ''To the Lighthouse,'' the Rabbit quartet. These works reveal us to ourselves, and it seems to me that this is who we are: we're people driven, damaged and tortured; we're people elated, sustained and nourished, all by the powerful, devastating, inescapable bonds within the family.</p>
        <p>As the golden retriever story reveals, I love all the issues, large and small, comic and tragic. I love hearing about them, I love thinking about them, and I even love struggling with the dark ones, late at night. They are endlessly interesting to me and endlessly surprising.</p>
        <p>Thinking about these endless, intricate, wonderful stories seems to be the task that's set for me, and I'm grateful for it. The stories are all around me. All I want is the opportunity to discover, ponder and absorb them, then to set them down. I want to get them exactly right. When I think I've succeeded at that, then I feel I have accomplished something.</p>
        <p>And this is where you, the reader, come in. For only you will know for certain if I have.</p>
