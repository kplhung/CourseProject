        <p>THE patenting of methods used in e-business has ignited anger and outrage in the world of Internet commerce, especially in the case of several high-profile companies that have received broad patents for widely used retail techniques. The dispute over Amazon.com's patent for its one-click shopping technology is an obvious example.</p>
        <p>Despite the heat, the Patent and Trademark Office has made clear that it intends to continue issuing patents on digital business practices, and entrepreneurs, therefore, will likely continue to stake out as much as they can of the new markets created as nearly every industry moves online. Inevitably, the debate over whether these patents foster innovation, or whether they stifle competition, will continue.</p>
        <p>The reaction could go either way for a patent awarded last month to two childhood friends: ''Method for Online Display and Negotiation of Cargo Rates.'' The patent covers a method of pooling the prices that various freight carriers charge for land, sea and air cargo shipments, posting them on a central Web site, and allowing customers to browse and comparison-shop for their shipping needs.</p>
        <p>The patent also allows shippers and customers to negotiate rates and routes, and to hold interactive auctions to set shipping rates. The inventors say they won a patent because no one else in cargo transportation had created a hub to consolidate shipping information.</p>
        <p>''This just came out, and I don't know who has seen the news or is privy to it,'' said Daniel Miller, one of the inventors and a lawyer in Mahopac, of the patent issued in May. ''But we haven't heard any objections to it from shippers, carriers or competitors.''</p>
        <p>Until last year, shippers ranging from corporations like Pepsi-Cola International to an independently-owned antique store had to contact individual freight carriers to get price quotes. That usually meant lots of phone calls, faxes and e-mails.</p>
        <p>Since the Web site, www.cargosphere.com, was started last February, the inventors say about 500 customers and shippers have registered.</p>
        <p>With hundreds of thousands of trucking, rail, air and ocean shipping companies in the U.S., and millions of potential customers, the number registered so far is small. Mr. Miller said he and his fellow inventor Neil Barni are promoting their patented business model and Web site at trade shows, through trade publications and with individual cargo companies and freight associations in an effort to add shippers and cargo brokers to their registry.</p>
        <p>For now, the service is free, but by fall the inventors plan to charge both buyers and sellers a $5 fee for any shipment smaller than a freight container, or $10 for one or more containers.</p>
        <p>The idea for the patent started with Mr. Barni, who lives in Dallas and has been friends with Mr. Miller since elementary school. Until recently, Mr. Barni worked for Pepsi, where he handled shipping and often spent much time on the phone, seeking competitive cargo prices.</p>
        <p>''Neil saw a real need for a way to get the best rates,'' said Mr. Miller. ''That was the genesis of the idea. I said it would be nice if people could negotiate online. We moved pretty quickly to get a patent application filed because we thought this was a very innovative, unique idea and there was nothing like it in the cargo transportation industry.''</p>
        <p>The patented method used on the Web site allows customers to anonymously review posted shipping routes and prices. Customers can negotiate with shippers, but a carrier's name is revealed only after a price offer is accepted.</p>
        <p>The process is not binding. If either the customer or the shipper decides they don't want to do business with one another, they can back out of the deal.</p>
        <p>''The main reason for anonymity is that carriers are very sensitive about having their rates published,'' Mr. Miller said. That is because prices can change frequently, he said, sometimes even fluctuating between morning and evening.</p>
        <p>Individuals can use the site as well, Mr. Miller said. The only caveat is that the service does not cover the shipping of small packages. ''We are open to anyone above parcel service,'' Mr. Miller said. ''We can't get into that and don't want to.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller said he expected no objections to the patent from the cargo industry or from large, established shipping companies that already have their own Web sites. ''If we can help them get rid of excess capacity or help customers find the best rates for shippers, then everyone stands to gain,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But in announcing the patent, CargoSphere.com also stated that the invention made it ''a front-runner in the competitive area of Internet shipping platforms,'' and the company's patent attorney said, ''The patent affords the company the right to exclude or to license others in that industry with respect to the patented  business model.''</p>
        <p>But restricting the patent's umbrella to cargo shipping alone may not give CargoSphere that exclusivity, experts said -- even if it is the first in its industry.</p>
        <p>''The fact that they put in the claims that it is limited to cargo or freight doesn't mean that it can't be challenged by something broader that was out there before it,'' explained Robert Perry, a patent attorney with Kenyon &amp; Kenyon in New York City who has found himself dealing increasingly with business method patents.</p>
        <p>He pointed out that Internet business method patents have yet to be tested in court. Uncertainty over their impact, he said, prompted Congress to add a new layer of protection to patent law last year for people who might be accused of infringing a business method patent. Under the new law, someone who can prove they used an electronic business method for a year before a patent application was filed cannot be sued, even if they did not make public their practices.</p>
        <p>''What will shake down when the courts come into it in five or six years is that there are a lot of people doing business in-house that is not the subject of patents, but will certainly be valid prior art,'' Mr. Perry explained, using the term for existing designs or practices. ''It will require a lot of digging, but that is how these business method patents will be challenged.''</p>
        <p>Daniel Miller and Neil Barni received patent 6,064,981.</p>
        <p>Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.</p>
