        <p>Noche Flamenca has acquired a large and enthusiastic following since its founding in 1993. The company knows how to put on a stylish show. And it did on Saturday night at the Connelly Theater.</p>
        <p>Soledad Barrio, the company's lead dancer, has grown immensely as an artist. Always fiery, she seemed possessed by smoldering, do-or-die flamenco passion in the solea, her one solo on the program. The dance built, too, to a fever pitch of intensity.</p>

        <p>Noche Flamenca has acquired a large and enthusiastic following since its founding in 1993. The company knows how to put on a stylish show. And it did on Saturday night at the Connelly Theater.</p>
        <p>Soledad Barrio, the company's lead dancer, has grown immensely as an artist. Always fiery, she seemed possessed by smoldering, do-or-die flamenco passion in the solea, her one solo on the program. The dance built, too, to a fever pitch of intensity.</p>
        <p>There was none of the elegance of the traditional long flamenco back here either, but rather a carved arch, in a short and sturdy body that had all the earthy urgency of the program's impressive singing. Ms. Barrio's hard-working, articulate feet had the same rough beauty.</p>
        <p>Martin Santangelo, the company's founder and director, achieves a remarkable balance between the new and the old in his savvy staging of the program. His new piece, ''La Plaza,'' places chairs and shifting performers about the entire stage space to achieve the sense of a crowded place and then magically proceeds to create a separate and solitary world as one by one each dancer rises and moves among the crowd.</p>
        <p>Mark London's lighting designs are a fugue of hard, glistening daylight and dense shadow. The coolness and somewhat distanced virtuosity of the program's other dancers provide a welcome respite from Ms. Barrio's scorching fire. An entire evening of her dancing would probably fill the city's coronary wards.</p>
        <p>Bruno Argento was the group's shimmering lead pyrotechnician, but conciseness would have made his solo more powerful. Alejandra Ramirez's slightly teasing minimalist approach to flamenco was charming, in a fine company completed by Ana Romero, Eva Marin and the boyish Noe Barroso.</p>
        <p>The exuberant, impressive musicians were Silverio Heredia and Antonio Vizarraga, both singers; the guitarists Arcadio Marin and Jose Valle, and the percussionist Jose Antonio Galicia, whose opening number was a soul-stirring tour de force of theater.</p>
        <p>Noche Flamenca performs through Aug. 13 at the Connelly (220 East Fourth Street, in the East Village) and will appear Aug. 22 to 27 at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass.</p>
