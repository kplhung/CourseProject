        <p>SENATOR PATRICK J. LEAHY admits it can all become a little obsessive. When he stumbles out of bed in the morning, his first destination is not the kitchen for a cup of coffee or the doorstep for the morning paper. It's to turn on his home computer.</p>
        <p>''It's the first thing I do before anything, I flip on the computer,'' says the man known to his colleagues as the cybersenator. As the computer warms up, he gets the cup of coffee. ''And then I come back with the coffee, in my pajamas, and I see what's come in,'' Senator Leahy says.</p>
        <p>What comes in? E-mail messages from staff members in Washington and constituents in Vermont. Petitions from colleagues in the international campaign to ban land mines, one of the senator's favorite causes. Family photographs that have been scanned into cyberspace by his three grown children.</p>
        <p>He will surf the Internet for breaking news. His bookmarks on the World Wide Web include sites for the Supreme Court (as ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, he needs to monitor the court's rulings), The Irish Times (he has an abiding interest in the land of his ancestors) and the Grateful Dead (www.dead .net).</p>
        <p>A white-haired 60-year-old grandfather and a 25-year veteran of the Senate, Mr. Leahy is a proud Deadhead, as the cultlike followers of the band are known. He takes pride in having introduced Jerry Garcia, the band's founder, who died in 1995, to Strom Thurmond, the Senate's oldest member -- and the senator perhaps least likely to have heard of Mr. Garcia.</p>
        <p>Senator Leahy's twin passions for the Dead and for cyberspace came together last week in a Senate hearing room, as he sat with a laptop computer and tried to download a copy of a favorite Dead anthem, ''Touch of Grey,'' as his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee watched with amusement.</p>
        <p>The download from the Internet site Napster was taking a long time. ''It went from 'Touch of Grey' to 'Touch of White' by the time it downloaded,'' Senator Leahy said, drawing laughter from a packed audience.</p>
        <p>The hearing was called to consider whether Congress needed to intervene to control Napster, Gnutella, mp3.com and other Internet sites that allow music to be shared freely among millions of fans, without copyright payments to artists and recording companies.</p>
        <p>The hearing's star witness was Lars Ulrich, drummer of the heavy-metal band Metallica, who complained that his work was being stolen off the Web. The band has sued Napster, accusing it of copyright violations.</p>
        <p>Senator Leahy does not know how Congress should respond to the issue. ''I don't know what the solution will be,'' he said after the hearing, taking a seat in the small office off the Senate chambers that he is granted by virtue of his seniority; it has a magnificent view toward the Washington Monument. ''Obviously artists deserve to be paid,'' he said. ''But our responsibility in the Congress is not to stifle innovation.</p>
        <p>''This is not like U.S. Steel evolving over decades. This could be a brilliant 19-year-old in a college dorm figuring out Gnutella or some like it. You can't stop it. You couldn't stop it even if you wanted to. What we need to do, I think, is make sure copyrights and patent laws actually reflect the new reality.''</p>
        <p>The senator draws a comparison between the arrival of Napster and its cyberspace kin, and the advent of the videocassette recorder in the 1970's, which was initially described by the Hollywood studios as a threat to their survival because of copyright violations.</p>
        <p>''Now you can't make a movie without figuring videos into the whole equation,'' he said. ''Some movies that are real turkeys in the theaters recoup their money in video.''</p>
        <p>WHATEVER the outcome, Senator Leahy knows how passionately some fans feel about their ability to grab music off the Internet.</p>
        <p>An e-mail campaign organized by music-sharing Internet companies jammed his electronic mailbox in the Senate with more than 17,000 messages last week, so many that he had to shut it down temporarily. ''I got more on this subject than I got on impeachment,'' the senator said. ''We turned it off because I don't want to crash the rest of my system.''</p>
        <p>In Silicon Valley and the other outposts of the Internet industry, Senator Leahy is seen as one of the champions of cyberspace freedom. But the senator knows that his work on the issue carries a political cost, especially after he led opposition to the 1996 Communications Decency Act and other popular legislation designed to block access by children to sexually explicit Internet sites.</p>
        <p>His critics -- mostly outside Vermont, where he remains so popular that he won the 1998 election with 72 percent of the vote -- have charged that Senator Leahy is siding with pornographers and pedophiles.</p>
        <p>But he is unrepentant, especially about the Communications Decency Act, and his opposition to the law on free-speech grounds was vindicated in 1997 by the Supreme Court, which agreed that the law was unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>He noted that as a state prosecutor in Vermont, ''I sent child molesters to prison.</p>
        <p>''But I yield to nobody in the Senate on the First Amendment,'' Senator Leahy said. ''I am not going to vote for a law that is so broadening that you could finish up closing down just about every library.''</p>
        <p>The responsibility for policing the Internet, the senator says, has to rest largely with parents, who can buy software that restricts access to Internet sites that feature pornography or that promote racism and other forms of intolerance. ''Maybe parents need to spend some time with their kids on the computer, figuring out what they're looking at,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That does not mean it is much fun for a politician to stand up for the rights of those who use the Internet to distribute graphic sexual images or messages of hate. The fight for free speech and other freedoms on the Internet can be a lonely one, Senator Leahy says.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is in favor of the First Amendment,'' he said. ''But we'd have a hell of a time ratifying it today.''</p>
