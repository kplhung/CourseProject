        <p>More and more often, the names and the strike zones are unfamiliar to Al Leiter, who has been in the major leagues since 1987. For years, there was little turnover among umpires, and when a new umpire came into the league, Leiter said, he was like a young pitcher added to a veteran staff: the experienced crew around him lifted his performance.</p>
        <p>Now, after 22 umpires lost their jobs in a failed labor strategy last summer, young umpires often serve on the same staff together. Two first-year umpires worked at the Skydome today, when Leiter and the Mets lost to the Toronto Blue Jays, 7-3.</p>
        <p>''I think some of the young guys have been a little intimidated and overmatched,'' said Leiter, the Mets' left-hander. ''It happened to us in the Yankees series. There were a couple of times when I've noticed the young umps -- not the older guys -- just seem a little bit less sure of themselves. And it's understandable. It's just like young players in the big leagues. You're not really sure.''</p>
        <p>The home plate umpire today was Mike Fichter, who is listed by Major League Baseball as a spring training umpire for 2000. Leiter retired the first 11 Blue Jays, then walked three in the fifth, leading to two runs, and allowed a grand slam to Marty Cordova in the sixth. Leiter was dismayed at the umpiring, adding that he hoped the people evaluating umpires' performance take note of the game.</p>
        <p>''I'm just a little frustrated with the most inconsistent umpiring I've ever had in my 12 years in the big leagues,'' Leiter said.</p>
        <p>Gone, he said, is the umpires' familiarity with a pitcher's repertory.</p>
        <p>''This guy had no clue I have a slider that breaks late and sharp,'' he said. ''I don't know how many sliders he's seen like that.''</p>
        <p>The Blue Jays agreed with Leiter's general assessment. One Toronto player said the strike zone changed three or four times during the game. ''It seemed like they missed as many calls as they made, for both teams,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Leiter walked Craig Grebeck to lead off the sixth, and Raul Mondesi singled up the middle. After an out and a Tony Batista single that was knocked down by shortstop Melvin Mora, Cordova came to bat.</p>
        <p>Leiter fell behind, 2-1, then made a pitch he thought was an obvious strike. ''I have to pitch now,'' Leiter said. ''It's 3-1, a beautiful hitter's count.''</p>
        <p>Not wanting to walk Cordova with the bases loaded, Leiter tried a slider, but it was not his best one, he said, because he wanted to get a strike or to have Cordova hit it at somebody. Cordova hit it to the relievers in the left-field bullpen, giving the Blue Jays a 6-3 lead with his first career grand slam.</p>
        <p>Leiter retired the next hitter, but two singles followed and he left after five and two-thirds innings, matching his season low for innings pitched. He allowed six runs, a season high, and fell to 10-3.</p>
        <p>The Mets had chances. They left 11 runners on base, and Todd Zeile made inning-ending outs three times, stranding seven runners. In the first inning, his line drive to center field held up just long enough to be caught. In the ninth, he grounded to second.</p>
        <p>But the out that really bothered Zeile, and helped embolden Leiter in making his postgame comments, was the called third strike that ended the seventh inning with the bases loaded. Blue Jays catcher Alberto Castillo set up outside, Leiter said, but the pitch came inside and was still called a strike. Zeile stood at home plate and argued the call as Fichter walked away.</p>
        <p>''I'm not somebody who assumes that's an easy job back there, having caught,'' Zeile said. ''But I'm also somebody who is very selective at the plate and I feel I've got a pretty good idea of the strike zone.''</p>
        <p>Zeile said he did not want to be ejected, and neither did Leiter, though he admitted he was ''that close'' to snapping. He is not alone among his teammates, who grumbled privately about losing to a pitcher, Roy Halladay, whose earned run average before the game was 11.68.</p>
        <p>The Mets have not played badly lately, but they have lost 9 of 12 games since Leiter beat Atlanta on July 1 to pull them within a game of first place. Now, the Mets are six games out, farther from first than they have been since May 31.</p>
        <p>''I think guys realize it's not going our way in bunches,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''It'll come our way in bunches. That's the way the game is. But we've got to make it happen.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>BENNY AGBAYANI was standing beside TODD PRATT in the Mets' clubhouse Friday when Pratt referred to the Red Sox's BRIAN DAUBACH as a ''scab'' following an on-field argument. Agbayani, who played with Daubach on the Mets' replacement team during the players' strike in 1995, told Pratt -- in a joking way, he said -- to take it easy. ''He apologized to me,'' Agbayani said. ''He said that he never meant that about me.'' Like his teammate RICK REED, another former replacement player, Agbayani has applied for admission to the players' union, without success. . . . The Mets had a game at Fenway Park delayed by a power outage on this road trip, and on Sunday their game was delayed for 12 minutes in the second inning as the Skydome roof was being opened. The game had begun with it partially open, leaving half the field shaded.</p>
