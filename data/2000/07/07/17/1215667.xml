        <p>EVEN before Lennox Lewis's second-round demolition of Frans Botha, the heavyweight champion was spreading the gospel of his greatness.</p>
        <p>''I am head and shoulders above everyone else,'' Lewis told anyone who would listen. ''In the past, people like Muhammad Ali and Joe Louis have reigned in the same way. I have served my time, and I deserve to be up there with Louis and Ali.''</p>
        <p>Up there, in other words, with the best heavyweight champions ever.</p>
        <p>Sorry, champ, but you've rushed to judgment -- your own judgment. Your name is Lewis, not Louis (or Ali). You're good, you're the undisputed heavyweight champion but you're hardly up there with Joe Louis and Muhammad Ali just yet. Or up there with Rocky Marciano, Jack Dempsey and Jack Johnson. Or even up there with Joe Frazier and Larry Holmes .</p>
        <p>Ever since Ali began shouting, ''I am the greatest of all times'' nearly four decades ago, it's been fashionable for boxers to proclaim their greatness, no matter what their weight division. With that in mind, Lewis is just talking the way boxers talk now, but he doesn't have the resume to justify it. His 37-1-1 record includes a conquest of only one undisputed heavyweight champion, Evander Holyfield, although many credit him with another triumph over Holyfield instead of their debatable draw at Madison Square Garden early last year. But other than Holyfield, who has Lewis beaten? Up to now, he's just the best of a bad lot.</p>
        <p>Botha was a typical foe. Staggered by Lewis's overhand right in the first round, the South African crumpled through the ropes when battered by a lethal left jab-right hand-left uppercut-right hand combination near the end of Saturday night's second round. He crawled back into the ring but the referee, Larry O'Connell, wisely waved his arms.</p>
        <p>The World Boxing Council and International Boxing Federation champion's other title victims include such forgettable names as Michael Grant, Zeijko Mavrovic, Shannon Briggs, Andrew Golota, Henry Akinwande, Ray Mercer, Tommy Morrison and Oliver McCall (reversing Lewis's only loss, a second-round knockout by McCall in 1994 in London).</p>
        <p>For Lewis to put himself on a pedestal next to Joe Louis and Muhammad Ali shows that he hasn't studied the names on the dance card of either champion, especially Ali's card. Ali stopped Sonny Liston twice, tortured Floyd Patterson and Ernie Terrell, lost a 15-round decision to Frazier but later beat Frazier twice, and knocked out George Foreman.</p>
        <p>The young Joe Louis lost to Max Schmeling, just as the young Lennox Lewis lost to McCall, but Joe Louis later wrecked Schmeling in a first-round knockout. Louis fought everybody and anybody on what was known as his ''Bum of the Month'' tour. In a friendly conversation with Louis years later, Ali teasingly asked him to talk about that ''Bum of the Month'' tour.</p>
        <p>''You'da been on it,'' Louis said.</p>
        <p>For all of Ali's dazzle, most boxing old-timers who saw both Louis and Ali at their best believe that Louis was better with a better punch, that if Louis and Ali had ever fought at their best, Louis would have knocked out Ali. And as inconsequential as most of the names on Lennox Lewis's dance card have been, the names aren't about to get any better.</p>
        <p>Lewis's next opponent, in a mandatory I.B.F. title defense, will be the world-renowned David Tua in November, possibly in Toronto. Lewis's promoter, Panos Eliades, is also talking about another London title bout next year with Wladimir Klitschko, the 6-foot-7-inch Russian heavyweight who battered Monte Barrett in a seventh-round knockout on the undercard Saturday night.</p>
        <p>And with Eliades professing to offer Mike Tyson $30 million to challenge Lewis, who surely would earn as much if not more, there's too much money involved for that fight not to materialize sooner or later -- as long as Tyson is at large. Even if he's banned in both Britain and the United States, he'll get a license somewhere in the world. ''I look on Tyson as a disease,'' Lewis said, ''and I'm the cure.''</p>
        <p>After Tyson's recent 38-second knockout of Lou Savarese, he challenged Lewis in a snarling harangue but then backtracked, saying he wasn't ready for a title bout. He is expected to fight Golota next but Botha, who dominated Tyson for four rounds before Tyson's one-punch knockout early last year in Las Vegas, compared Lewis's power with Tyson's power.</p>
        <p>''Tyson hit me with a punch I didn't see,'' Botha said. ''Lennox has that long reach; if he can keep Tyson on the outside, he can be victorious.''</p>
        <p>But even a quick knockout of a tempestuous Tyson wouldn't put Lennox Lewis on a pedestal next to those where Joe Louis and Muhammad Ali are perched. He needs to do a lot more. And say a lot less.</p>
