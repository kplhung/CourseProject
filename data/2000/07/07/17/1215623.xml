        <p>ON Madison Avenue these days, you're either on the island or off the island.</p>
        <p>For the second consecutive summer, couch potatoes have unexpectedly switched from traditional fare like sitcoms, news magazines and dramas to offbeat offerings like reality series and prime-time quiz shows. With the breakout of sudden hits like ''Survivor'' and ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ad agencies are scrambling to adapt to these abrupt shifts in viewing patterns.</p>
        <p>''I do think it's harder,'' said Bob Igiel, president for the broadcast division of the Media Edge in New York, part of Young &amp; Rubicam. ''We have to be smarter and more innovative than ever before.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, the executives at agencies who try to determine in advance which television shows will succeed, then try to buy commercial time on those programs at the lowest possible prices, have always been playing poker for high stakes.</p>
        <p>''It's really hard to predict a hit, and anybody who tells you they can is lying,'' said Laura Caraccioli, vice president and director at Starcom Entertainment in Chicago, part of the Starcom Worldwide media agency owned by the B Com3  Group.</p>
        <p>The aim of the poker game is to get in on the opening hand before a series becomes must-see TV, but avoid wasting precious ad dollars on shows that turn into must-skip TV.</p>
        <p>''To be involved in the next 'water cooler show' everyone is talking about is great,'' said Stacey Lynn Koerner, vice president for broadcast research at TN Media in New York, owned by True North Communications. ''But nobody thought 'Millionaire' would be what it was until we saw the first two weeks and said, 'Hmmmmmm,' '' recalling the program's debut as a summer fill-in last year.</p>
        <p>The big danger that agencies confront, then, is failing to help their clients keep pace with rapidly changing whirl of consumer habits. That's a fate worse than being voted off the island on ''Survivor,'' or missing an easy $100 or $200 question on ''Millionaire.'' So agencies are stepping up their efforts to clamber aboard band wagons before they begin rolling -- or at least jump aboard before they gain much momentum.</p>
        <p>''It's always a calculated risk when you're considering an unproven program,'' said Bret Itskowitch, vice president and account director at Mediacom in New York, part of the Grey Global Group.</p>
        <p>''But now there's a different way of looking at things,'' he added. ''There's greater opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Mediacom executives were early fans of ''Survivor,'' Mr. Itskowitch said, and ''we did everything we could'' to persuade one client, Reebok International, to become a sponsor of the unusual series.</p>
        <p>''Reebok had not been a huge network advertiser,'' Mr. Itskowitch said, referring to the company's recent reluctance to advertise during prime time on broadcast TV when prices are highest.</p>
        <p>''But this was an obvious fit,'' he added, ''and it's worked out perfectly for us.''</p>
        <p>As part of the sponsorship package Mediacom bought for Reebok, one of nine sold by CBS, the 16 contestants wear Reebok apparel and footwear, which are continually seen during each episode. And the Reebok creative agency, Berlin Cameron &amp; Partners in New York, was permitted to use contestants already voted off the island in commercials that run during subsequent episodes of the show.</p>
        <p>For example, a spot that ran last week featured Stacey Stillman, an early deportee, jogging through a jungle as a ''Survivor''-like explorer plucks lagoon leeches from his skin. Other sponsors like Anheuser-Busch are also running commercials with desert-island themes.</p>
        <p>Another ''Survivor'' sponsor, the Pontiac division of General Motors, followed a recommendation by its media agency, G.M. Mediaworks, to promote a new product -- in this instance, a sport utility vehicle named Aztek -- during the new series. That was a risk because ''Survivor'' was still an unproven show when the decision was made.</p>
        <p>''To be honest, my first thought was that we'd rather go with something more established,'' said Don Butler, Aztek brand manager at Pontiac in Detroit.</p>
        <p>''But the more I thought about it,'' he added, ''the more I thought: 'It's risky, it's on the edge. But it might make sense.' '' The last ''Survivor'' contestant not voted off the island will win prizes including an Aztek.</p>
        <p>The Media Edge bought sponsorships in ''Survivor'' for two clients, Ericsson and the U.S. Army. The agency hooked up another client, AT&amp;T, with ''Millionaire'' on ABC, sponsoring the contestant aid known as the ''phone a friend'' lifeline.</p>
        <p>''A producer of 'Millionaire,' Michael Davies, came to me before the show ever went on the air'' in August 1999, Mr. Igiel recalled. ''He showed me some of the footage from the original version in England and I came out of my chair like a landed tuna.</p>
        <p>''I can't tell you I thought it would be the mammoth hit here that it is, but I thought it had potential,'' he added. ''And with the lifeline, where in a stressful situation, dependability is wonderful, AT&amp;T could really showcase itself.'' The sponsorship includes mentions of AT&amp;T by the host, Regis Philbin, when a lifeline call is placed as well as superimposing AT&amp;T logos on screen.</p>
        <p>'' 'Sure things' are too often, I hate to say it, sure failures,'' said John Mattimore, senior vice president and associate media director at BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. ''You're better off going the other way once in a while.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mattimore and his colleagues bought a ''Survivor'' sponsorship for Visa because, he said, ''I've been doing this for 25 years and we keep telling the networks: 'Take chances. Don't keep doing the same things. We don't need 10 ''Friends'' wannabes.' So if we say it, we should be able to support it.''</p>
        <p>Needless to say, that is music to the ears of the top sales executives at the broadcast networks. They have been stung by complaints from agencies about having to pay higher prices each year for commercial time despite declining ratings.</p>
        <p>''I thought 'Survivor' would be fairly successful,'' said Joseph Abruzzese, CBS sales president in New York, a unit of Viacom Inc. ''But it's been wildly successful.''</p>
        <p>The reality series is attracting viewers far younger than those usually watching the network, he added, as well as advertisers that don't typically buy prime-time spots on CBS.</p>
        <p>The last episode of ''Survivor,'' on Aug. 23, will run 2 hours, twice as long as the first 12. And commercial time will be ''double'' the $275,000 to $350,000 that NBC charged for each 30-second spot during the baseball All-Star Game last week, Mr. Abruzzese said. That's also about double what CBS has charged for a 30-second spot on ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>''When I first heard about 'Survivor,' I said, 'You've got to be kidding me,' '' said Marv Goldsmith, president for network sales and marketing at ABC in New York, part of the Walt Disney Company. ''But I give CBS credit.</p>
        <p>''We were talking about 'Survivor' two years ago, to get a feel for it from advertisers,'' he added, ''and Coca-Cola said, 'Can they drink Coca-Cola?' We said: 'It's a desert island. You don't have a vending machine on a desert island.' ''</p>
        <p>But ABC is consoling itself with ''Millionaire,'' which initially also ''had trouble getting advertisers,'' Mr. Goldsmith said.</p>
        <p>''After the first show,'' he added drily, ''it was slightly easier.''</p>
        <p>Agencies continue to worry when gauging the odds for or against sponsoring programs before their potential can be determined, as evident in  the mixed reception for another CBS reality series, ''Big Brother.''</p>
        <p>For instance, Starcom has not bought commercials during ''Big Brother,'' Ms. Caraccioli said, but some clients may get so-called make-good spots on the show to compensate for ratings shortfalls elsewhere.</p>
        <p>By contrast, TN has bought time during ''Big Brother'' for clients like Schering-Plough, a ''Survivor'' sponsor, and S. C. Johnson, Ms. Koerner said, adding: ''You can't write it off. It's still outperforming what CBS would have had on in its place.''</p>
        <p>And the Fox Broadcasting unit of the News Corporation is just starting to sell commercial time during ''American High,'' a documentary reality series to begin on Aug. 2.</p>
        <p>''The audience is not accepting the same-old, same-old,'' said Jon Nesvig, president for sales at Fox in New York. ''We have to try new things, and the advertisers have to take chances also.''</p>
        <p>In the new TV landscape, the highs can be higher, as the record summer viewership for ''Survivor'' has proved. But the lows can be lower, too, as Fox learned from the fiasco surrounding a reality special in February, ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?''</p>
        <p>''God knows they're lower,'' Mr. Nesvig said, laughing.</p>
