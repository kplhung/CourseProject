        <p>Breaking a strict news blackout maintained by his staff at the Camp David summit meeting, President Clinton told a newspaper editor today that he was more optimistic than when the talks opened six days ago but that he was not sure an agreement would be reached.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton made the comments to The New York Daily News after the newspaper reached him at Camp David and asked him to reply to allegations in a book that his wife, Hillary, had made anti-Semitic remarks about Mr. Clinton's campaign manager nearly three decades ago. [Page B5.]</p>
        <p>The allegations, made in ''State of A Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton,'' by Jerry Oppenheimer have been given prominent coverage in The New York Post, which vigorously opposes Mrs. Clinton's Senate candidacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton apparently jumped at the opportunity to defend his wife when The Post's main competitor, The News, gave him a chance to do so. He then answered two questions from , Michael Kramer, a managing editor for political affairs, about the  summit meeting, according to P. J. Crowley, a White House spokesman.</p>
        <p>''We might make it, I don't know,''  Mr. Clinton told The News, according  to a transcript made available by the White House.</p>
        <p>''God, it's hard,'' Mr. Clinton continued in the phone conversation from his cabin at Camp David.</p>
        <p>''It's like nothing I've ever dealt with, all the negotiations with the  Irish, all the stuff I've done with the Palestinians before this and with the Israelis, the Balkans at Dayton.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said that what most troubled him was the prospect of what would happen afterward, if the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, did manage to reach an accord.</p>
        <p>''They know if they make a peace agreement, half of their constituents  will have to be angry at them for a while,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton sounded an upbeat tone, he also added: ''I would be totally misleading if I said I had an  inkling that a deal is at hand. That's just not true. But we're slogging.''</p>
        <p>By giving a telephone interview to The Daily News, Mr. Clinton was supplementing a one sentence statement released at Camp David on the  allegations about Mrs. Clinton. In that statement, Mr. Clinton said his wife had never made the comments ascribed to her. ''I was there on  election night in 1974, and this charge is simply not true,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''It did not happen.''</p>
        <p>In the book, Mrs. Clinton is accused of making an anti-Semitic slur against Paul Fray, the campaign manager for Mr. Clinton's failed 1974  congressional race.</p>
        <p>The way in which Mr. Clinton came to Mrs. Clinton's defense seemed to indicate a strong concern that the accusation may hurt Mrs. Clinton's standing with Jewish voters in her race for the Senate against the Republican candidate, Representative Rick A. Lazio, Republican of Long Island.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Clinton's summit meeting, if successful, is likely to have a positive effect for Mrs. Clinton's candidacy in a state where Middle East peace is more of an issue than in many other places.</p>
        <p>The president's words on the summit proceeding were made without  the knowledge of his press secretary, Joe Lockhart, Mr. Crowley said. The exact way in which Mr. Clinton was contacted by The Daily News was not known by White House officials either. Mr. Crowley said only that Mr. Clinton was given the opportunity to call the newspaper to comment on the Oppenheimer book and agreed to answer Middle East questions at the end of the interview.</p>
        <p>The transcript was made by the White House from material made  available by The Daily News, Mr. Crowley said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said he hoped to go ahead with his planned departure for Okinawa, Japan, on Wednesday. He is scheduled to meet there with the  leaders of the seven leading industrial nations, known as the Group of 7, and the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
        <p>As the scheduled departure for that trip begins to crowd in on the Camp David summit talks, the stream of chatter by Israelis and Palestinians on the outside who say they know what is going on inside rose steadily today.</p>
        <p>And what they say -- some of it gloomy, some of it upbeat, and all of it calculated to influence opinion back home in the Middle East -- is that it is still too early to tell whether there will be an agreement at all or, if there is one, what kind of agreement it will be.</p>
        <p>''They say it is impossible to know where it is heading,'' said an official who has spoken to participants by telephone. ''That's the good news.''</p>
        <p>A common assumption was that it would not be clear until Tuesday, the eve of Mr. Clinton's scheduled departure for Japan, whether the talks are ''going in the right direction or not,'' the official added. Only then would the White House decide whether the talks were ripe enough to warrant keeping Mr. Clinton at Camp David and sending Vice President Al Gore to the meeting in Okinawa of the leaders of the world's major industrial nations. Mr. Clinton is scheduled to leave on Wednesday to join other leaders there and meet the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
        <p>The White House has been saying since the opening of the summit meeting that Mr. Clinton would go to Okinawa. But in the lead-up to Camp David, and in private, Clinton administration officials have said that, for the president, the Okinawa trip was not necessarily written in stone.</p>
        <p>One reason it is still premature to assess whether there will be any kind of accord is that, so far, there has been no real test of wills, according to those who have spoken to participants. Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak have not yet been through a major blowup on the substance of the issues, the officials said. Those issues are the most nettlesome separating the two sides, including borders, water rights, the fate of Palestinian refugees and what to do about Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim as their capital.</p>
        <p>Only if a ''big crisis'' occurred -- a threat to walk out, a defiant refusal to compromise on an issue -- could it be known whether there was going to be a breakdown or a breakthrough, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Apparently there was what one official called a ''small crisis'' involving Mr. Arafat when he was presented with some proposals on resolving the status of Jerusalem. The Palestinians let it be known that Mr. Arafat threatened to leave because the proposals, apparently presented by the Americans, were too close to the Israeli public position.</p>
        <p>But one Palestinian official said the flare-up appeared to be tactical. If he is to compromise, Mr. Arafat, who has insisted for decades that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a Palestinian state, could not afford to stay hidden at Camp David and then emerge having deviated significantly from his stance, the official said.</p>
        <p>In Israel, where tens of thousands of demonstrators marched in Rabin Square in Tel Aviv against proposals that would allow some settlements to remain inside a Palestinian state, there was a flow of gloomy talk.</p>
        <p>The foreign minister, David Levy, who refused to come to the summit meeting with Mr. Barak, said the gaps between the parties remained as wide as ever. The justice minister, Yossi Beilin, who tends to be less harsh in his judgments, told Israeli radio, ''It is hard at this point to give some kind of impression of optimism more than yesterday, or the day before yesterday, because there has been no breakthrough.''</p>
        <p>In Jerusalem, the mayor, Ehud Olmert, held a meeting at City Hall  to express concern about the future of the city. Eli Yishair, the leader of the Shas Party, which quit Mr. Barak's government just before the prime minister's departure for Camp David, told the gathering: ''The president of the United States has to understand that here, the people of Israel are mostly united. Most of the people are against dividing Jerusalem. Most of the people are for a united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty.''</p>
        <p>A cabinet minister, Haim Ramon, again spoke out about Jerusalem today, sending a warning that concessions on the city were impossible and that, as he has often stated, the future status of Jerusalem should be decided at another time.</p>
        <p>And in keeping with this fairly stern line from the home front, Israel radio reported that the Israeli delegation at Camp David believed that Palestinian officials were spreading upbeat interpretations about the talks in order to avoid blame for a breakdown.</p>
