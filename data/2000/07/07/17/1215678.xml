      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The sewers are backed up at Seventh and Elm Streets again, and pools of scummy liquid are collecting in the collapsing gutters and rutted street in front of the Bible Tabernacle Church.</p>
        <p>It stinks.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Heyward Wiggins of Bible Tabernacle is there, talking about his hopes for his stricken city, now that the state has given up on Camden's local government and is set to begin the first city takeover in the state's history, amounting to the imposition of a benign but absolute dictator. It is also to be the biggest city takeover in the country since the Great Depression.</p>
        <p>''If you ask people what they want, they would say they want Camden to be comfortable to live in again,'' Mr.  Wiggins says. ''They would say they just want to sit on their front porch without someone harassing them or sneaking in the back door. They want the streets cleaned and the sewers fixed. They don't want big things. They want little things.''</p>
        <p>But delivering services, little or big, is just what Camden's city government has been unable to do. Done in by government corruption, poverty and the flight of manufacturing industries, it has been functionally bankrupt for more than a decade, kept afloat with cash from Trenton, which now pays for 70 percent of the municipal and public school budget. In this city across the Delaware River from the chiseled, historic skyline of Philadelphia, not one residential street has been repaved for years, and 16 percent of the buildings are abandoned. The high school dropout rate is 50, 70 or 80 percent, depending on whom you ask, and the infant mortality rate (27 deaths per 1,000 births in 1996) is three times that of the suburbs whose borders lie less than a mile from where Mr. Wiggins stood.</p>
        <p>More than 200 open-air drug bazaars are in operation, but there are only 80 city police officers on duty at one time. In March, Milton Milan became the third Camden mayor in 20 years to be indicted on corruption charges.</p>
        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman toured Camden in 1996 and looked around in despair. ''I thought to myself, 'There's no way you can raise a child here,' '' she said at the time.</p>
        <p>So this week, Mrs. Whitman handed the Legislature her Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Revitalization Act, which would strip power  from the mayor, City Council and regulatory and licensing agencies in Camden and put it all in the hands of one person, a chief management officer appointed by the state.</p>
        <p>The Legislature is out of session now, but is expected to pass the bill with minor changes when it reconvenes in the fall.</p>
        <p>The manager would have the power to break contracts, ignore Civil Service rules in hiring and firing, issue or revoke licenses and direct all appointments and spending decisions. The manager's only obligation to the public would be to consult with a state-selected board of local citizens and to hold two public hearings a year.</p>
        <p>The reason, said Ulrich H. (Al) Steinberg, director of the division of local government services, is that Camden's city government has simply ceased to function.</p>
        <p>''It's like quicksand,'' Mr. Steinberg said in an interview. ''You look in the books for something and you find there's no solid footing. There is paper and there are words, but they are empty. There's no basis for what they say.'' These days, state agencies bypass the city government and deal directly with a shadow government of nonprofit social and housing groups to bring everything from new housing to day care to health care to Camden's 85,000 residents.</p>
        <p>There have been three other takeovers of bankrupt cities and incompetent or corrupt city administrations in recent years, but Camden's is the biggest of them all. Michigan took over the tiny Detroit suburb of Ecorse in 1986; Massachusetts took over the Boston suburb of Chelsea, population 35,000, in 1992; and Illinois has been operating East St. Louis, population 39,000, since 1994.</p>
        <p>Chelsea's takeover resulted in a revamped city charter and was an unqualified success. The results in East St. Louis and Ecorse are mixed. The cities are still struggling.</p>
        <p>Harry Spence, until recently the vice chancellor for operations of the New York City public schools, was the receiver, or manager, for Chelsea for three years. New Jersey officials have consulted extensively with him. In an interview, he said that when things were as bad as they were in Camden, a takeover was the only way to go.</p>
        <p>''Piecemeal intervention is not enough to draw the necessary confidence either from the citizens themselves or from outsiders to come in and invest in new development,'' Mr. Spence said.</p>
        <p>''When you leave the government structures in place, you allow the existing cadre of elected officials and their cohorts to take up all the space, to maintain a continued sham of democratic process,'' he added. ''You have got to break open space for new people to enter, because at this time the chances of any rational member of the Camden population, for a hero to step in, are so slim that they not going to happen.''</p>
        <p>But Camden is mostly black and Hispanic. The idea of a white governor like Mrs. Whitman and a Republican administration in Trenton abolishing self-government in a mostly minority city resonates in threatening ways among city leaders. This racial disparity confronted state officials with their most delicate task, of alliance building inside the city before they could let the hammer fall.</p>
        <p>Gwendolyn A. Faison, president of the Camden City Council and a black woman, practically levitated out of her seat with anger when word came down, during a Council session this week, that the takeover bill had been introduced.</p>
        <p>''My father was beaten off the courthouse steps in Clinton, North Carolina, just for asking to register to vote,'' Mrs. Faison declared. ''To register! Do they think we are going to give up the right that my people fought for and died for?''</p>
        <p>But it is a measure of Camden's desperation, and of the state's careful cultivation of local allies, that the city's grass-roots leaders, including black leaders, think exactly that.</p>
        <p>Camden is home to some of the most bumptious Democrats in the state -- it was the cradle of former Gov. Jim Florio's career as a political fighter -- but years of preparation by the Whitman administration have won over the core of the city's civic leadership, minority and Democratic as it is, to the idea of a state takeover.</p>
        <p>On June 13, two major church groups, Camden Churches Organized for People, a mixed group of Roman Catholic Hispanic and black congregations, and the all-black Concerned Black Clergy, filled St. Joseph's Pro-Cathedral on Federal Street with 1,500 residents to invite the state to take over their city.</p>
        <p>In exchange for the support, the state agreed to a manifesto presented by the church leaders that describes the city's ills and lists timetables for solutions: demolishing 362 condemned buildings within one year; shutting down 200 drug markets within three years; and creating a timetable for raising the graduation rate from Camden high schools to 70 percent, among other things.</p>
        <p>Sean Closkey, the head of St. Joseph's Carpenter Society, which rehabilitates houses for low income owners, said it would be a mistake if other New Jerseyans, who enjoy a booming economy and never need to creep through Camden's blighted streets, think people here are not aware of the magnitude of their choice.</p>
        <p>''You lost the ZIP code lottery and now your chances of dying are three times higher because you were born here,'' Mr. Closkey said. ''That's when you start to wonder when the principles of democracy are trumped by questions of social justice. If we are given the right to rule without the tools, is that democracy? People here are asking those questions. They may not be asking them in Summit or Short Hills, but they are here.''</p>
        <p>Many members of the nonprofit church groups that already act as a kind of surrogate government will presumably fill out the 15-member advisory board the new city manager is required to create and consult. This reliance on religious leaders riles those in the City Hall faction who are losing their power.</p>
        <p>''It's a church-run coup d'etat,'' said Luis Pastoriza, the Camden municipal clerk. ''We're going to have a faith-based government, like the ayatollahs.'' Mr. Pastoriza stands to lose his municipal job as a result of the takeover.</p>
        <p>The Rev. James E. Fitten, president of Concerned Black Clergy, has watched the political power of Camden's black community shrink, first with the election of the city's first Hispanic mayor in Mr. Milan, and now at the prospect of a state takeover. He lives in an ornate, lovingly restored 19th-century brick row house on Chambers Avenue, just down from Cooper Hospital. Yet half of the houses on his block, including one adjoining his, are boarded up, and the quaint cobblestone street is an obstacle course. He faces the issues behind the takeover every day, he said.</p>
        <p>''I understand all of the arguments,'' Mr. Fitten said. ''But we need people in government who are competent and truthful, and who have the proper skills to guide the community. They're going to have my neck for saying it, but I just don't see those things in this city right now.''</p>
        <p>For all the disagreements between City Hall and the takeover proponents, there is no disagreement about what Camden needs. Church people, City Hall leaders and state officials say that Camden's problem can only be solved by market-driven solutions, principally by attracting middle-class residents and the businesses that cater to them.</p>
        <p>''I don't think that Camden ought to be a warehouse of the poor,'' said Msgr. Robert McDermott of St. Joseph's. ''I think Camden ought to have its share of middle-class people, people who can afford to pay taxes, who would make the school system better, and who would render certain parts of the city better places to live.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinberg, the state's takeover specialist, looks at Philadelphia's  cityscape rising spellbindingly across the Delaware from Camden's nearly empty riverfront and wonders why no on has discovered it as a place for investment yet. Back on Seventh Street, in front of Mr. Wiggins's Bible Tabernacle, Benny Lopez, recently of Brooklyn, was thinking along the same lines.</p>
        <p>''They've got to make this place pretty,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''With a better environment, you get better people, and with better people, you get more businesses. Like New York.''</p>
