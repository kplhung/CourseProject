        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Poll Finds Optimistic Outlook but Enduring Racial Division'' (front page, July 11):</p>
        <p>You report some troubling disparities in whites' beliefs about where they want to live. Two-thirds of whites said they believed that most whites preferred to live in white areas. Somewhat fewer whites -- 49 percent --  said they thought that most white people they personally knew preferred to live in predominantly white areas. But your chart reports that only 24 percent of whites said they personally preferred to live in white areas.</p>
        <p>Since 85 percent of whites actually live in areas where they have few or no black neighbors, it appears as if whites are reasonably accurate in their beliefs about the prejudices of white people in general, inaccurate in their beliefs about white people they know, and in total denial when it comes to their own racial attitudes.
