        <p>YESTERDAY afternoon, a crowded stadium roaring like the three-ring circus that is track at its very best. High jumpers, pole-vaulters and sprinters all competing at once.</p>
        <p>For about an hour yesterday at the United States Olympic track and field trials, all eyes focused on the long-jump pit, where history was unfolding and folding up. All eyes were on Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who competed in four Olympics and is one of the most outstanding athletes of the last century.</p>
        <p>But yesterday she was chasing the rising sun, Marion Jones, 25, who kept intact her bid to become the first track athlete to win five gold medals in one Olympics.</p>
        <p>Joyner-Kersee, 38, won her first Olympic gold medal in 1984, when Jones was 9 but already developing her sprinting resume.</p>
        <p>Inactive since 1998, Joyner-Kersee decided to give the Olympics one final try. No one was jumping out of the box, and besides, she wasn't going to let Jones or anyone else inherit her mantle by default. Jones would have to take it.</p>
        <p>''I don't give up,'' Joyner-Kersee said.</p>
        <p>She did not give up; Jones took it.</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon, Section 102 of Hornet Stadium was a tense collection of family, friends and coaches. The front-row scene was classic, a photo of aspirations: past, present and future. There was C. J. Hunter, Marion Jones's husband. Next to him was Trevor Graham, Jones's coach.</p>
        <p>To Hunter's right sat Al Joyner, Jackie's brother and the husband of Florence Griffith Joyner, the sprinter, who died two years ago. Sitting in his lap was their 9-year-old daughter, Mary. For Joyner-Kersee, yesterday was a direct challenge, not so much to Jones but to the coming generation of athletes Jones leads.</p>
        <p>Joyner-Kersee had not jumped since 1998; she watched track and field from afar, spending most of her time managing her foundation in East St. Louis, Ill., tending to her Nascar interest. But out of the corner of her eye she watched the distances of the female long jumpers. She noticed, as July approached, that nobody, including Marion Jones, was jumping out of the box. No one was long jumping so fantastically that Jackie Joyner-Kersee would be intimidated from even competing.</p>
        <p>So here she was. And here she learned the lesson all great champions inevitably learn when their time has passed. Younger legs and stronger arms make up in strength what they lack in experience, and make up in speed what they lack in frame of reference. Watching from afar is one thing, but in the end it ain't nothing like the real thing.</p>
        <p>Joyner-Kersee performed a minor miracle by making the second round. At one point Jones was fourth with a jump of 22 feet 1 3/4 inches; Joyner-Kersee was fifth at 21-10 3/4.</p>
        <p>After Joyner-Kersee jumped 20-11 1/4, Jones uncorked a jump of 22-7. On that jump, Hunter, who had been sitting stoically, jumped up and clapped. Moments later Bob Kersee, Jackie's husband and coach, walked by and in a gesture quick and subtle, stuck out his hand to Hunter. They shook hands. Joyner-Kersee kept moving. History kept moving.</p>
        <p>Jones eventually won with a jump of 23- 1/2 on a special day of demarcation, when the weight of being the face, heart and soul of track and field shifted from Joyner-Kersee to Jones.</p>
        <p>''Regardless of how I did, I wanted to give it my best shot before I ended my career,'' Joyner-Kersee said.</p>
        <p>This was a special day for 9-year-old Mary Griffith Joyner, too.</p>
        <p>Before today she had never seen her aunt Jackie compete in person. ''It was always on tape or on television,'' Al Joyner said. ''All her classmates would write book reports about Jackie, but I wanted her to see her perform. I wanted her to see this. She saw her aunt dig down deep just to make it to the second round.''</p>
        <p>I wondered how Joyner felt as he watched his sister compete for the last time with his daughter at the first major race he attended since his wife died. He wore a shirt she had made, with her world record printed on the back.</p>
        <p>''It's been tough,'' Joyner said. ''I've been growing, maturing. But it's been tough.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon his daughter -- their daughter -- saw the remarkable tide of history. Her aunt was the tide going out, Marion Jones was the tide coming in.</p>
        <p>Her mother, Flo-Jo, is like the omnipresent ocean. When historians talk about the 100 meters, they talk about her mother, who has the fastest time ever run and four of the five fastest times ever run. When historians talk about the 200 meters, they talk about her mother, who owns three of the top five times. And when historians talk about great female athletes, they talk about her aunt Jackie.</p>
        <p>When Jones was asked about how it was to compete against Joyner-Kersee, she said: ''All of the long jumpers and all of the fans stood still while she was on the runway. You watch her at all times to make sure you don't miss something magical or historical.''</p>
        <p>There was no magic, but a sense of a sport replenishing itself.</p>
        <p>Marion Jones was 9 when Jackie Joyner-Kersee won her first Olympic gold medal. That's the distinguishing virtue of this sport: dawn after dawn after dawn.</p>
        <p>No sunsets. Just dawns.</p>
