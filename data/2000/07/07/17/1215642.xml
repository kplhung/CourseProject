        <p>A deal between the telecommunications company Global Crossing and Exodus Communications collapsed over the weekend as the two companies failed to agree on a price, people close to the companies said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Executives for Global Crossing had been in talks in recent days to sell its Web site-hosting unit, Global Center, to Exodus in a stock swap valued at $7 billion. For Exodus, the transaction would have allowed it to enlarge its leading role in the hosting industry, in which companies provide services like security and high-speed connections for other companies' Web sites. Recently, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan entered the market through its $5.5 billion acquisition of Verio Inc.</p>
        <p>Early last week, the two companies agreed on several issues, including that Global and Exodus would form a joint venture in Asia and that Global would receive about 151 million shares of Exodus stock in exchange for Global Center, people close to the talks said. But as shares of Exodus soared after rumors of the talks leaked -- up 39 percent for the week -- executives for Exodus wanted to revise the number of shares. The final offer from Exodus, said the people close to the talks, was for $6.6 billion in stock, or about 120 million shares.</p>
        <p>Both boards met on Friday, and the deal was not approved. Executives for Global Crossing, one person said, were concerned that as quickly as Exodus's stock price had risen it could fall and were asking for some kind of price protection if that happened.</p>
        <p>Instead, Global Crossing will most likely proceed with plans to sell shares of Global Center in a public offering. Global Center filed documents last month with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue tracking stock in the company.</p>
        <p>For Global Crossing, which is based in Hamilton, Bermuda, the possible sale of its Web site-hosting business would have represented a departure from its earlier strategy of providing a wide array of telecommunications services to its clients. Global Crossing, founded in 1997, sells time on its global undersea fiber optic network, in addition to other activities.</p>
        <p>According to analysts, Global Crossing could be preparing to enter the fray of big telecommunications mergers by shifting the focus of its operations to make itself more attractive for a possible suitor. Large European companies like Deutsche Telekom have shown eagerness recently to expand in the United States, where Global Crossing is strongest.</p>
        <p>Global Crossing reportedly entered into, and then broke off, negotiations with Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telephone company, in March. And in its own effort to expand through acquisitions, Global Crossing tried to buy Equant N.V. of the Netherlands, a deal which would have given it access to the world's largest data network. But talks with Equant ended last month after a series of disagreements between the two companies.</p>
        <p>Under the direction of Leo J. Hindery Jr., the chief executive who recently joined the company, Global Crossing could also be trying to concentrate better on the niche of providing international data and voice services over its worldwide network. Last week, for example, the company sold its slow-growing local telephone unit to Citizens Communications of Stamford, Conn., in a $3.65 billion transaction.</p>
        <p>''They're obviously putting a new coat of paint on the house,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst. ''It's another example showing that the sharks are circling the U.S. telecom industry.''</p>
