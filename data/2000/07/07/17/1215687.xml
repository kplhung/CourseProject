        <p>Tiger Woods knows golf history. He knows golf has been played at St. Andrews, Scotland, for centuries. He knows he could make history at St. Andrews, becoming the first person to win all four major tournaments -- the career Grand Slam -- by age 24.

        <p>Tiger Woods knows golf history. He knows golf has been played at St. Andrews, Scotland, for centuries. He knows he could make history at St. Andrews, becoming the first person to win all four major tournaments -- the career Grand Slam -- by age 24. He knows that nobody has won the United States Open and the British Open in the same year since 1982, when Tom Watson did it.</p>
        <p>Knowing all that, and knowing he annihilated the field last month at the United States Open, Woods will begin Thursday's opening round of the British Open with huge motivation, not only to win, but also to add to his legacy. And there is no better place to make history than the Old Course at St. Andrews, often referred to as the home of golf, where great champions like Bobby Jones, Sam Snead, Peter Thomson, Jack Nicklaus, Seve Ballesteros and Nick Faldo have prevailed.</p>
        <p>In golf, Woods is used to getting what he wants. And because the British Open is the one major he does not have, it has become the major he covets most.</p>
        <p>''St. Andrews is very special,'' Woods said last week before leaving for Europe. ''To have a chance to complete the career Grand Slam at the course where it all started is very symbolic. I'd love to win there. Any golfer would.''</p>
        <p>Nobody would be shocked to see Woods win at St. Andrews. In fact, it would be more shocking if he did not contend. Coming off his record-setting 15-stroke victory at the United States Open, Woods enters the tournament as a huge favorite. And based on his stunning performance at Pebble Beach, the pressure of being the favorite is hardly unsettling.</p>
        <p>''He was the favorite heading into the Masters, he was the favorite heading into the U.S. Open, he's the favorite heading into the British, and no matter what happens, he'll be the favorite heading into the P.G.A.,'' said Mark Steinberg, Woods's agent. ''Think about it. When isn't he the favorite? It's part of the deal. He can handle it.''</p>
        <p>The Old Course at St. Andrews seems to fit Woods's game like a tailored suit. Depending upon the direction and strength of the wind, Woods may be able to reach the green off the tee on two or three of the par-4 holes. He can also fly past many of the bunkers that come into play for other golfers. Shot-making around the greens will be crucial, and who has a more creative short game than Woods?</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the weather plays a significant role at St. Andrews, particularly the wind, which can change directions whimsically. Yet, with his penetrating ball flight, coupled with his ability to work the ball right-to-left or left-to right, Woods welcomes the wind.</p>
        <p>''I hope it howls, all four days,'' Woods said, smiling. ''In any golf tournament, the wind separates guys who are striking the ball really well from those who aren't.''</p>
        <p>What does Woods think when he hears people say St. Andrews suits his game? He smiled again.</p>
        <p>''Any course suits my game when I'm playing well,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even great players, however, have difficulty winning majors on a regular basis. Nicklaus won the first of his 18 professional major championships at the 1962 United States Open, and he won his last major at the 1986 Masters. During that span, Nicklaus won 18 of 96 majors, a winning percentage of 18.7. Starting with his victory at the 1997 Masters, Woods has won 3 of the past 14 majors, a winning percentage of 21.4. And Woods has yet to win two majors in the same year, which Nicklaus did five times.</p>
        <p>Nicklaus also completed the career Grand Slam at a British Open in Scotland, winning at Muirfield in 1966, at age 26. Nicklaus had already won the United States Open (1962) the Masters (1963 and 1965) and the P.G.A. Championship (1963).</p>
        <p>It took Nicklaus five attempts to win his first British; Woods has already played the British five times. Woods's first British was at St. Andrews in 1995, where he tied for 68th as a 19-year-old amateur. His performance at the British has improved as his game has become more complete. In 1998 Woods tied for third at Royal Birkdale and last year at Carnoustie tied for seventh.</p>
        <p>To increase his chances of playing well this week, Woods followed his normal pre-British Open routine, spending last week in Ireland, golfing, fishing, relaxing, getting adjusted to the time change and cooler temperatures. Be wary of Woods after a rest; he has entered seven tournaments this year after taking at least a week off, four of those times, he has won.</p>
        <p>Since last month's dominant performance at Pebble Beach, Woods has been working on shots he will need at St. Andrews -- low-trajectory shots, bump-and-run shots, long lag putts that could be crucial on the spacious greens. Practicing can be almost as enjoyable for Woods as competing, and he hopes his preparation for the British Open will yield the same results as his practice before the United States Open.</p>
        <p>''One of the reasons why I play better after I take time off is because I can prepare in solitude and peace,'' Woods said. ''When you're at a tournament practicing, you can't practice the same way. It's impossible. You can't go out with a cart, play a quick five holes, test out what you did, then come back to the range.''</p>
        <p>Despite his worst showing of the year last week, a tie for 23rd at the Western Open, Woods saw encouraging signs.</p>
        <p>He drove the ball well, and his iron play was excellent. John Daly proved how important length is at St. Andrews by winning the last British Open played there in 1995. Control is also important at St. Andrews, however, as evidenced by Faldo's victory in 1990.</p>
        <p>But even Woods could be hindered by some of the quirks that make St. Andrews distinctive. The weather changes so quickly and so dramatically that golfers are often at its mercy. Calm mornings can turn into nasty afternoons, and on those days, players with early tee times have an advantage.</p>
        <p>''There'll be some luck of the draw involved if the weather fluctuates,'' Woods said. ''That's one of the variables of the British Open. You just have to deal with whatever you face, don't let it get to you.''</p>
        <p>In the 1995 British, Woods shot 74-71-72 but ended with a final-round 78 in blustery conditions. He is a far better player now, yet if he draws bad-weather tee times, it will be difficult to break 70.</p>
        <p>''I played a practice round at St. Andrews where I played 18 straight holes into the wind, just because the tide changed,'' Woods said. ''The tide was going out, then it was coming back in when we were finishing. That's the way that golf course can play.</p>
        <p>''I wish we got a chance to play links courses more often. It's so much different than the golf we play here in the States, target golf, where you're trying to hit the ball an exact distance all the time. One day at St. Andrews, I hit 2-iron, sand wedge on the first hole.</p>
        <p>''The next day, on the same hole into the wind, I hit driver, 4-iron. That's one of the reasons why we love that course.''</p>
        <p>Scottish golf fans are eagerly awaiting Woods, who appreciates the astuteness of European fans.</p>
        <p>''The galleries over there are so knowledgeable,'' he said. ''Over here, if you get the ball airborne, everyone goes crazy. Over there, if you have an easy wedge, and you land it on the green 30 feet from the hole, you won't hear anything. But if you have a long iron into a difficult wind, and you play an approach shot that lands anywhere near the hole, they'll give you loud applause. They know how difficult certain shots are, and they have an appreciation for good golf. It's a great atmosphere. I love it.''</p>
        <p>Woods will love the atmosphere even more should he win. He has a history of rising to special occasions. And in golf, having a chance to complete the career Grand Slam at St. Andrews is about as special as it gets.</p>
