        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Poll Finds Optimistic Outlook but Enduring Racial Division'' (front page, July 11): As some of the articles in your series have suggested, race in America is not simply a black and white matter. I wonder what we might have learned about race in America if Asians, Latinos and even Native Americans had been included in your poll on race relations. Perhaps we might have an even more nuanced view of race in America.</p>

        <p>It seems important when discussing how race is lived in America to know whether race is perceived differently by other nonwhite racial groups, and whether whites and blacks share similar perceptions of other nonwhite groups.</p>
