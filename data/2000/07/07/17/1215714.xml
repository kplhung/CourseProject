        <p>Re ''Why Harlem Drug Cops Don't Discuss Race'' (''How Race Is Lived in America,'' front page, July 9):</p>
        <p>You report the pressure that police officers experience from their superiors to make drug arrests. This has resulted in rampant violations of the rights of African-Americans and Hispanics. It was unlawful for police in the article to detain and search men who stood on the street near an apartment where drugs were found, since the men had no connection to the drugs or the apartment.</p>

        <p>Re ''Why Harlem Drug Cops Don't Discuss Race'' (''How Race Is Lived in America,'' front page, July 9):</p>

It was unlawful for police in the article to detain and search men who stood on the street near an apartment where drugs were found, since the men had no connection to the drugs or the apartment.</p>
        <p>White people are almost never treated this way. Yet the acceptance by the courts of virtually any story that the police can concoct to justify an arrest allows the police to continue racist and illegal searches and detentions when the law does not allow it.</p>
        <p>As long as we care more about the quantity of arrests than about their legality, we are encouraging a lawless police force.</p>
