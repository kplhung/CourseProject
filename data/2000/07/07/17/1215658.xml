        <p>Helen Austin was late for work the other day, something that almost never happens. She spent the morning at the beauty shop, crying and praying with her hairdresser.</p>
        <p>''Her only son was killed going to work three months ago,'' Mrs. Austin said at Save Our Future, the neighborhood center where she volunteers. ''She's having a very hard time. She's lost 30 pounds.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Austin's eyes were still red and puffy an hour later. In her hand she held a crushed ball of tissue and a poster announcing a reward for the young man's killer.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Austin wasn't just crying for her friend. She was also crying for her own family -- two of her grandchildren have been killed over the years. And she was crying for her community of south Los Angeles, which in the last several months has been bloodied, along with many other parts of the city, by a wave of violence and killing, a scourge that many here thought was fading fast.</p>
        <p>''I think we're starting to see the start of another epidemic,'' said Billie Weiss, executive director of the Violence Prevention Coalition of Greater Los Angeles. ''It's starting to look like the early 90's again.''</p>
        <p>In more than two dozen interviews this week with teenagers, middle-aged ex-gang members, mothers of murdered children, social workers, elected officials, neighborhood advocates, police officers and a woman whose disabled brother was shot to death the day before the interview, people here said they were afraid and baffled by the rise in violence and just as determined to stop it.</p>
        <p>''There's no quick fix,'' said Gary Honore, who speaks to youth groups about the perils of the streets and has buried a daughter, a brother and a sister slain in the last decade. ''But if we don't start today, there won't be a tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>After years of dropping crime rates across the city and county, there have been 266 homicides in Los Angeles this year, a 30 percent increase from a year ago. About 42 percent of the killings have been gang-related, according to the Police Department. But no one knows for sure what is causing the surge, beyond the usual suspects of drugs, turf and too many bored and desperate young men -- and some women -- able to get their hands on too many powerful weapons.</p>
        <p>''What I know is that it has got to stop,'' said a Los Angeles City Council member, Mark Ridley-Thomas, whose district has been hard hit by the violence. ''It seems to be coming on rather ferociously.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ridley-Thomas is pushing the City Council to allocate $5 million in emergency money to create summer jobs and violence-prevention programs, which have been struggling because of lack of money, he said.</p>
        <p>''We've had as many as 13,000 summer jobs in the past,'' he said. ''Now, it's down to 3,500.''</p>
        <p>Even in this booming economy, jobs for teenagers and for ex-convicts like Melvin Farmer, 43, are hard to find in the inner city, despite being so crucial in stopping the violence, many people here said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farmer, a longtime gang member, has been in and out of prison for nearly 20 years. He was last in prison three years ago. He came out determined never to return and today is vice president of the National Alliance for Positive Action, a neighborhood and youth advocate group.</p>
        <p>''I've been out three years, and I can't find a job because of my record,'' Mr. Farmer said. ''I might go two or three days without eating. There are a lot of temptations out here, but I'm never going back to that life. It would kill my mother.''</p>
        <p>At one of at least three anti-violence meetings held last week across the city, a Los Angeles County supervisor, Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, said finding jobs for ex-convicts should be a priority because so many are beginning to return to the streets.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday morning, another anti-violence meeting was held, this time in the City Council chambers. As dozens of people filed into the chamber, Anthony Wingate, 46, was being helped to his chair in front of his building in South-Central Los Angeles. Mr. Wingate was partially paralyzed 12 years ago after being shot in a robbery, his sister, Natalie, said. He sat in the chair every morning, greeting passers-by.</p>
        <p>Shortly before 9 a.m., a man walked up to Mr. Wingate's neighbor, Clifton Adams, 24, and shot him to death. Then he turned on the only witness in sight, the crippled man in the chair.</p>
        <p>''My brother couldn't run,'' Ms. Wingate said. ''He was handicapped. He had to be carried to the bathroom. He didn't deserve to be killed like that.''</p>
        <p>The next day, a red candle left on the stoop as a memorial to Mr. Wingate had melted over the sidewalk like blood.</p>
        <p>''That ain't his blood,'' a relative said. ''But that's some of his brains in the grass.''</p>
        <p>Such stories don't faze lanky Kenneth, a 17-year-old who attends an after-school program for troubled teenagers called People Who Care. ''It's always more killing when it's hot,'' Kenneth said. ''I might get killed myself. Three days back, my friend got shot in the hip. I just know it's a possibility every time I wake up.''</p>
        <p>Kenneth is about the same age as the slain sons of the three friends who founded Justice for Murdered Children, LaWanda Hawkins, Vicky Lindsey and Rita Norwood. They founded the group four years ago because they felt left out of the system and because the killers of their children were never caught. The group tries to pressure local police departments to investigate inner city homicides more aggressively.</p>
        <p>''There are therapy groups we could have joined,'' Mrs. Hawkins said. ''But we wanted something else. We wanted justice for our children.''</p>
        <p>Back at Save Our Future, Mrs. Austin said she wanted justice for her friend's son, too. She got some tape to put the reward poster up at the south Los Angeles center, which offers neighborhood life skills and employment training. The center was founded by Mrs. Austin's stepdaughter, Charlotte Austin Jordan, to honor her murdered children.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Jordan's 13-year-old daughter, Jamee, was killed in 1988, a victim of mistaken identity. She was shot 15 times. ''That started my crusade,'' Mrs. Jordan said. In 1996, her son Corey, 25, was shot and killed by a 41-year-old gang member. ''Corey had two children and one on the way,'' Mrs. Jordan said. ''The baby was born two days after we buried my son.''</p>
        <p>The men who killed her children had been in and out prison since they were young teenagers. ''Nothing in prison happens to help them change,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Jordan has a 15-year-old son who asked her, ''Am I going to die like that, too?''</p>
        <p>''I couldn't just say no,'' Mrs. Jordan said. ''All I could say was that I will do everything I can to make our community safe for him.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, she moved her family to the suburbs, ''so my son could have his childhood back.''</p>
        <p>As she talked, a former gang member named Hakeem, 29, and his brother Mookie, 14, came in. Hakeem is the same age Mrs. Jordan's son would be if he were alive, and she has practically adopted him. He calls her Mom. His own mother was killed in a drive-by shooting several years ago while he was locked up for a murder, committed when he was 13.</p>
        <p>Mookie is dressed in baggy pants and is wearing a black bandanna on his head. ''In order to stay out of trouble, you have to change the way you dress,'' Mrs. Jordan said to him.</p>
        <p>Mookie looked at the floor.</p>
        <p>''He's just like my little cousin who got shot in his neck and his back,'' Hakeem said. ''Now he's paralyzed. He's just 15.''</p>
        <p>Hakeem sounded angry and sad.</p>
        <p>''I shot and killed someone,'' he said. ''I know violence ain't the answer. I don't want my little brother to be like me.''</p>
        <p>Mookie likes to go swimming, but the neighborhood pool is controlled by rival gang members. ''First we fight,'' he said. ''Then we swim.''</p>
        <p>When his cousin was shot by one of the boys who claim the pool, Mookie immediately thought revenge. It is the easiest thing in the world to get a gun in his neighborhood. But he didn't. ''Because of my brother,'' he said. ''He told me it wasn't the way. And I don't want to get locked up for the rest of my life.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Jordan smiled. At least for a day, someone was listening.</p>
