        <p>In the latest merger between food companies seeking strength through scale, General Mills has agreed to pay $10.5 billion for the Pillsbury division of Diageo P.L.C., executives close to the talks said yesterday. The deal is set to be announced today.</p>
        <p>The acquisition of the Pillsbury brands, which had sales of $6 billion last year and include Green Giant vegetables, Haagen-Daz ice cream and Old El Paso Mexican food, vaults General Mills into the No. 5 spot among American food makers. The company will have $12.2 billion in annual sales and will be a dominant player in the increasingly important refrigerated section of supermarkets, where General Mills sells Yoplait and Colombo yogurt and Pillsbury is a key purveyor of ready-to-bake cookies and biscuits, and in the food-service sector, which supplies products to restaurants and institutions. Less vibrant but strengthened is the baking division, where General Mills owns Gold Medal and Betty Crocker and the Pillsbury Doughboy is a household name.</p>
        <p>''A stronger General Mills is emerging, and that's what the industry needs,'' said Jeffrey G. Kanter, an analyst for Prudential Securities. With its broader lineup of brands, General Mills is no longer as dependent on breakfast cereal for earnings. Cereals like Cheerios, Cocoa Puffs and Lucky Charms accounted for more than half the company's earnings last year, Mr. Kanter said, but the category is troubled by high prices and dwindling demand.</p>
        <p>The deal, which values Pillsbury at 1.7 times last year's sales, is the latest in a flurry that began this spring when Unilever P.L.C. made an unsolicited bid for Bestfoods that culminated in a $20.4 billion agreement last month. That move shook up the sluggish food sector, which had logged little growth recently and had seen share prices slide drastically. With supermarket chains consolidating into a relative handful of strong global players over the last several years, brand-name food makers felt their power slipping and have sought ways to regain influence with retailers.</p>
        <p>Eroded stock prices played a role in the General Mills deal as well. The company agreed to pay $4.5 billion in cash and $5.4 billion in stock for Pillsbury. The company, whose shares closed Friday at $36.3125, also argued that its stock would rise to at least $42.55 and agreed to cover the difference with a fee of up to $642 million if its shares do not reach the target within the next 12 months. For tax purposes, General Mills paid the fee up front but will receive a rebate if its stock hits $42.55.</p>
        <p>One analyst applauded that detail, saying it could promote better results from the combined company. ''It puts a little extra pressure on their performance and adds a little more discipline to the economics,'' said Jaine Mehring of Salomon Smith Barney, who has a price target of $45 for General Mills over the next year.</p>
        <p>Diageo will have a 33 percent stake in General Mills, the executives said, and will name two directors to the General Mills board. One is expected to be the Diageo chief executive. Paul S. Walsh, Diageo's chief operating officer, who recently served as Pillsbury's chairman and chief executive, is to take the top job at Diageo in January.</p>
        <p>Both Pillsbury and General Mills are based in Minneapolis. While some job cuts are expected from combining operations, the resulting company is likely to strengthen the area's economy, local officials said last week. ''Any opportunity to see them grow and keep our companies home-based is good news,'' said the mayor of Minneapolis, Sharon Sayles Belton.</p>
        <p>Another analyst, Erike Gritman Long of J. P. Morgan, said the price paid was on the high side, considering how the Pillsbury brands have been performing. ''We'll still need to get some details from General Mills about what they think this does to their top-line growth,'' she said. ''Some investors will argue that, given the amount of equity they are giving away, they will need to accelerate top-line growth.''</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for General Mills and Diageo could not be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>With its Pillsbury division sold and plans under way to spin off its Burger King fast-food restaurants, Diageo plans to focus on the liquor business and its Guinness beer holdings. That could mean acquiring brands in the near future and returning some cash to shareholders, a spokeswoman said last week.</p>
        <p>Some premier liquor brands are up for grabs, including Chivas Regal Scotch and Martell Cognac. Those brands are owned by the Seagram Company, which has agreed to be acquired by Vivendi S.A., a French conglomerate that has said it plans to sell the brands to pay off debt.</p>
        <p>Some analysts expect General Mills to sell brands that do not fit its portfolio. Among those could be Green Giant, which makes canned and frozen vegetables, and Haagen-Daz. Unilever paid $326 million in April to acquire Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade, which could help command a high price for Haagen-Daz.</p>
        <p>And it is possible that the new General Mills will become a target for a larger company. Ms. Long said last week that it was already attractive for Nestle S.A., the Swiss-based food giant, and having Haagen-Daz in its lineup made it even more so.</p>
