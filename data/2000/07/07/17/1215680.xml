        <p>In his 16 years of business in West Harlem, Dario Pichardo has run a restaurant, a car service and a beauty salon. And when he has needed money to keep his businesses afloat, Mr. Pichardo said, he has not hesitated to go to loan sharks, despite sky-high interest rates and the implied threat of violence for unpaid debts.</p>
        <p>''You have to get loans where you can, personal loans, and that can be expensive,'' said Mr. Pichardo, 46. He explained that he has little alternative since banks have regularly denied his loan applications. ''It's a painful method for getting money. For a small businessman, it can hurt him quite a bit and drain from the few benefits that he has.''</p>

        <p>In his 16 years of business in West Harlem, Dario Pichardo has run a restaurant, a car service and a beauty salon. And when he has needed money to keep his businesses afloat, Mr. Pichardo said, he has not hesitated to go to loan sharks, despite sky-high interest rates and the implied threat of violence for unpaid debts.</p>
        <p>''You have to get loans where you can, personal loans, and that can be expensive,'' said Mr. Pichardo, 46. He explained that he has little alternative since banks have regularly denied his loan applications. ''It's a painful method for getting money. For a small businessman, it can hurt him quite a bit and drain from the few benefits that he has.''</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Pichardo, a Dominican immigrant, is thinking about a loan for his latest venture, Anoranza D'29 Restaurant on Amsterdam Avenue, which opened in September. Although his place is crowded at lunch hour with diners hungry for sancocho stews, garlicky chicken and other Dominican dishes, Mr. Pichardo said he needs $5,000 to replace the water-stained drop ceilings, the chipped floor tiles and the cheap-looking Formica tables. And he wants to add some classy touches, like a bar and a brass banister.</p>
        <p>But this time, Mr. Pichardo said, he hopes he will get help from a Washington Heights credit union that is scheduled to open a second branch today at 1631 Amsterdam Avenue near 141st Street, between Cabrini Car Service and a Blimpie outlet.</p>
        <p>The financial institution, Neighborhood Trust Federal Credit Union, is one of the more successful of the 30 community-based credit unions in New York City. Since it opened in 1997, it has accumulated $5 million in assets, about double the amount of the deposits in most neighborhood credit unions. Based in a former bank on Fort Washington Avenue and 178th Street, the credit union has provided services to residents who once kept their money under mattresses and went to loan sharks when they needed money.</p>
        <p>The 3,000 members of Neighborhood Trust can open no-fee checking accounts with a minimum of $100. They can apply for low-interest loans for amounts from $500 to $10,000 to expand tiny businesses like home-run day care centers and beauty parlors. Neighborhood Trust even employs a full-time teacher who runs free classes for neighborhood residents interested in learning how to keep a budget, how to understand the mysteries of credit or how to run a small business.</p>
        <p>''I think they've done a lot of things right; there are a lot of things to emulate,'' said Clifford Rosenthal, director of the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions, a nonprofit organization that provides management support to credit unions.</p>
        <p>Mark D. Levine, who runs Neighborhood Trust, said expanding into West Harlem made perfect sense because of the area's dire need for financial services. The median family income in the neighborhood is $12,849, and an estimated 51 percent of adults do not have a banking account, according to Neighborhood Trust's business plan.</p>
        <p>''There are only two bank branches for over 75,000 people,'' said Mr. Levine, 31, a Maryland native who taught at a public school in the Bronx before starting Neighborhood Trust with other former teachers and community leaders. ''And so in has come an entire industry of check-cashing stores and pawn shops and loan sharks that are, in a sense, filling the gap but doing it in very exploitative ways.''</p>
        <p>Like many people in low-income neighborhoods across the city, large numbers of residents of West Harlem have never dealt with a bank. Many have shunned banks because the costs are too high; banks typically charge monthly fees on checking accounts if the balance falls below $3,000. Others do not have enough identification to open accounts or feel alienated by banks.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Ronnie L. Faison, pastor of Traveler's Rest Baptist Church on Amsterdam Avenue, said many of his parishioners have been eagerly awaiting the credit union since officials from Neighborhood Trust told them weeks ago that the new branch would be coming to their area.</p>
        <p>''Most people go out of the area for financial services, or they have their own little setups, home safety vaults,'' explained Mr. Faison. ''It means a great deal to have something like this right here.''</p>
        <p>Ramon Murphy, co-owner of Natali Supermarket on West 143rd Street and president of the 2,000-member Deli Grocery Store Owners Association, said the absence of established financial institutions and the inability of small business owners to secure loans has led many to turn to loan sharks, or ''prestamistas,'' as they are known to Dominican shop owners.</p>
        <p>The loan sharks, he said, charge exorbitant weekly interest rates that can turn a $5,000 loan into a $20,000 payback. And it is not unheard of, he said, for a small business owner to lose his shop to a loan shark because he cannot make the payments.</p>
        <p>''The service we need is a bank that integrates itself into the community, so the small businesses can borrow,'' said Mr. Murphy, who owns two bodegas with Arsenio Mendoza. Both have strongly supported the arrival of Neighborhood Trust.</p>
        <p>Milton Balcacer, a businessman who lives in Washington Heights, knows the pitfalls of counting on prestamistas.</p>
        <p>Before joining Neighborhood Trust two years ago, Mr. Balcacer said, he never kept track of earnings, expenditures or inventory for his store, Milton Variety, on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. He also turned to loan sharks when he needed $14,000, a move that cost him $28,000 by the time he repaid the initial loan and the interest.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Balcacer said, he is running his business smoothly. He completed a course for entrepreneurs run by Neighborhood Trust and learned how to keep his books in order and watch the bottom line. Recently, he received a $3,500 loan, which he is repaying in 18 months at 8 percent interest.</p>
        <p>''I'm running a better-organized business,'' he said. ''I'm progressing. Before, I would throw my money in my pocket and never keep track. Now, what little I make from sales, I put my earnings in the bank.''</p>
