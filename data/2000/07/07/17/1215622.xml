        <p>Out of Africa  In the Mongo language of the Congo, ''satonge'' means ''happening.'' And ''Satonge!'' is what is happening from 6:30 to 8:30 on Wednesday night, when the Museum for African Art begins its fifth annual series of musical performances. Presenting everything from traditional African and African-rooted music to current Afro-pop and jazz, the six-concert series starts with African rumba by Wendo Kosloy and Band at the museum, at 593 Broadway, between Houston and Prince Streets in SoHo. Information: (212) 966-1313.</p>
        <p>Trolling for Votes  In 1952 the advertising man responsible for the M&amp;M's ''melts in your mouth, not in your hands'' slogan had another idea. His name was Rosser Reeves, and he approached supporters of Dwight D. Eisenhower with the idea of running some television commercials touting him for the presidency. Despite a cool initial reaction, Reeves persisted, and eventually the first presidential campaign commercials appeared. Beginning on Friday as the 2000 presidential campaign heats up, the Museum of Television and Radio will present ''Madison Avenue Goes to Washington: The History of Presidential Campaign Advertising.'' The screening of memorable and historically significant presidential commercials from 1952 through 1996 runs in New York and Los Angeles through Nov. 12. Information: (212) 621-6600 in New York and (310) 786-1000 in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Long Ago, Far Away  In the long history of ancient Egypt, one brief era has attracted paramount interest: the Amarna period (1353-1336 B.C.), the age of Ikhnaton, Nefertiti and Tutankhamen. Withdrawing from the traditional capitals of Thebes and Memphis, Ikhnaton (also known as Akhenaten) and his wife Nefertiti abandoned multiple deities for a single god (Aton, the disc of the sun), created a new capital at Ikhtaton (now Amarna) and saw their planned city of magnificent temples and brightly decorated palaces flourish. Now, more than 250 works from the Age of Amarna will be exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago beginning today. ''Pharaohs of the Sun: Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen'' continues through Sept. 24. Information: (312) 930-4040.</p>
