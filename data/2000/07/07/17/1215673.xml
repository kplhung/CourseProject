        <p>If there is anything as inevitable as death  and taxes, it is the fact that the presidential candidates will be debating tax policy. Certainly the differing proposals by both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore to cut taxes will keep the issue before the voters. Later in the campaign, we will be looking at the details of their plans. But at this early stage, we feel it would be useful to define some broad principles that ought to govern the choice of potential tax cuts. The threshold question that needs to be asked is whether tax cuts of any kind are the best way to bring about economic growth as well as progressive policy goals like expanded health care.</p>
        <p>If there is to be a tax cut, it should make the tax code more simple, fair and progressive. Progres-sivity is a time-honored principle often forgotten in  the political debates. But since the beginning of this century, Americans have consistently embraced the principle that calls for the wealthy to pay proportionately larger shares of their income in taxes. The tax system became less progressive after the tax cuts of President Ronald Reagan and more progressive after tax increases under Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton. The latest Treasury estimate is that the top fifth of American families accounts for 56.7 percent of American family income but 65.1 percent of total federal tax revenues. The top 1 percent accounts for 14.8 percent of total income and 20.1 percent of tax revenues. These rates do not make for an excessively progressive tax system.</p>

        <p>If there is to be a tax cut, it should make the tax code more simple, fair and progressive. Progres-sivity is a time-honored principle often forgotten in  the political debates. But since the beginning of this century, Americans have consistently embraced the principle that calls for the wealthy to pay proportionately larger shares of their income in taxes. The tax system became less progressive after the tax cuts of President Ronald Reagan and more progressive after tax increases under Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton. The latest Treasury estimate is that the top fifth of American families accounts for 56.7 percent of American family income but 65.1 percent of total federal tax revenues. The top 1 percent accounts for 14.8 percent of total income and 20.1 percent of tax revenues. These rates do not make for an excessively progressive tax system.</p>
        <p>Some argue that higher taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers -- particularly the marginal income  tax rate of 39.6 percent and the estate tax --  are destructive of the incentive to create more wealth. But raising the highest income tax rates  on the wealthiest families in 1993 did not deter  them from increasing their wealth throughout the decade.</p>
        <p>Beyond the importance of progressivity, fairness dictates that taxpayers in similar categories be treated equally. But this principle can be difficult to put into practice. Many in Congress argue that it is unfair for a married couple earning the same income and filing a joint return to pay more in taxes than an unmarried couple filing separately. This bipartisan group wants to eliminate the so-called ''marriage penalty.'' Doing so, however, would lower taxes on families with higher incomes.</p>
        <p>The tax code is filled with quandaries like this one. A certain amount of inequity is inevitable in the tax code. Two families with the same income, living across the street from each other, might pay dramatically different amounts of taxes depending on which took advantage of tax breaks for health care, child care, education or tax-free investments. A major step toward simplicity was taken in 1986, when several layers of credits, deductions and loopholes for special interests were stripped out of the tax code so that all taxpayers could enjoy somewhat lower rates.</p>
        <p>In the years since then, however, many more tax breaks have been introduced. Faced with a Republican Congress, President Clinton has been a master at expanding the role of the federal government, not by spending programs but by tax credits for child care, education and other activities. Now both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have moved in the direction of more tax breaks. The Texas governor calls for new tax credits for long-term health care, education, health insurance, charitable giving and adoptions. Mr. Gore proposes tax credits for health insurance premiums, after-school care, college tuition and retirement savings. All these proposals make the tax code more complex, adding to the billions it already costs taxpayers simply to prepare their forms. Rather than indiscriminately handing out more tax incentives, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush should consider simplifying the code and achieving the lower tax rates they think the voters are demanding in an across-the-board but progressive way.</p>
        <p>Tax cuts, in the final analysis, should be tested on whether they eat up too much of the federal surplus, leaving little money for other needs. They must not be weighted toward the wealthy, like the repeal of the federal estate tax that has now passed both houses. They should keep the tax code equitable and be set up in a way that the working poor can use to their advantage.</p>
        <p>The logic for large tax cuts is that the surplus ''belongs'' to American taxpayers and should be returned to them before being used for more federal spending. What that formulation leaves out is that the federal debt also belongs to the taxpayers,  and so does the obligation to think about huge future costs, including the retirement security of the current work force. Assuring that the next generation will have the education and skills to keep  the economy growing, and a clean environment to live in, is also an obligation that belongs to the taxpayers.</p>
