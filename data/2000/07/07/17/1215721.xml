        <p>After nearly three weeks, an unidentified woman who was found nearly comatose in a motel near Atlantic City has begun offering small clues as to who she is, communicating in nods from her hospital bed since Friday. But the police say they remain baffled by her story, or lack of one.</p>
        <p>On June 28, the authorities have said, the woman -- who is black, about 50 years old and weighs about 250 pounds -- checked into a Days Inn, a motel along United States Route 30 in Galloway Township, about 15 miles from Atlantic City. She gave the name Maxine Hall.</p>

        <p>After nearly three weeks, an unidentified woman who was found nearly comatose in a motel near Atlantic City has begun offering small clues as to who she is, communicating in nods from her hospital bed since Friday. But the police say they remain baffled by her story, or lack of one.</p>
        <p>On June 28, the authorities have said, the woman -- who is black, about 50 years old and weighs about 250 pounds -- checked into a Days Inn, a motel along United States Route 30 in Galloway Township, about 15 miles from Atlantic City. She gave the name Maxine Hall.</p>
        <p>When she did not check out the next day, the manager entered her room and found her unconscious from an overdose of prescription drugs of a class that includes the tranquilizers Valium and Xanax, the Galloway Township police say.</p>
        <p>The woman left no confirmation of her identity, and the labels of all the prescription bottles had been taken off, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police found a key to a post office box in Denver that has not proven to fit any box; a schedule for a bus that runs from New York City to Cape May, 40 miles farther down the Garden State Parkway; and pamphlets advertising weight loss methods, Lt. Frank Johnson of the Galloway police said.</p>
        <p>The Denver police said they knew of no one named Maxine Hall, nor did anyone with that name fitting her description show up in any databases in New Jersey, said a Denver police detective, Gene Guigli. Her fingerprints have yielded no clues.</p>
        <p>The woman did not appear to be homeless, the police said. She was well dressed, her suitcase neatly packed. Shortly after arriving at Atlantic City Mainland Hospital in Galloway, the woman fell into a coma. But on Thursday, she opened her eyes and appeared to respond, albeit incoherently, a hospital official said. On Friday, a nonstaff correspondent for The New York Times, Lisa Suhay, went to the hospital to try to learn more about the woman.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Suhay read a book of fables to the woman, she appeared to respond to the stories. Ms. Suhay began asking questions, to which the woman responded by nodding or shaking her head.</p>
        <p>The woman indicated that Maxine Hall was not her name, but that she had lived in Denver, though not recently.</p>
        <p>Asked if she had tried to contact relatives in New Jersey and had a bad experience, the woman wept.</p>
        <p>The next day, the woman was transferred to Atlantic City Hospital in Atlantic City, where she remains in serious condition. When the police tried to talk to her there, however, they got nowhere. They said they believed that she didnot trust them.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Johnson has asked Ms. Suhay to accompany him to the hospital tomorrow and try to talk to the woman again.</p>
