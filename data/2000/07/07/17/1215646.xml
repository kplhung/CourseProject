        <p>Joyce Purnick Metro Matters column on the credit due to people of New York City's poorer neighborhoods, as opposed to Giuliani administration, for ending crack epidemic of 1980's and ushering in an era of reduced crime; cites Wayne Barrett's book Rudy!

        <p>REVELATIONS about Rudolph W. Giuliani's family and friends are the juicy parts, and they certainly are intriguing. But for us policy nuts, one of the new biographies of the mayor raises even more compelling questions about the startling drop in the city's crime rate.</p>
        <p>In a dizzyingly complex chapter, Wayne Barrett, the author of ''Rudy! An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani'' (Basic Books), examines everything from who should get the credit to whether City Hall has massaged the statistics. We leave the numbers to the statisticians; suffice it to say that while the mayor puts a self-referential emphasis on the positive, the city is safer now than it was a decade ago.</p>
        <p>But so are nearly all the nation's cities.</p>
        <p>Even criminologists cannot yet comprehensively explain the nationwide change, but we do have one answer, which has been overshadowed by the political game of credit-taking. As Mr. Barrett convincingly reminds us, poor neighborhoods played a central role in turning themselves around, especially in quelling the devastating crack epidemic of the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Jeremy Travis, senior fellow at the Urban Institute and former director of the National Institute of Justice, said: ''I think it is a big issue, not captured in any official record-keeping system, so people do not have easy access to data. It's the untold story.'' Certainly it is the undertold story, now being examined in a growing body of academic literature.</p>
        <p>The theories are many, but the experts all agree that the end of the crack epidemic came from the streets up.</p>
        <p>Crack was a central cause of crime in the 1980's. It destroyed families, provoked drive-by shootings, generated crack houses. In 1989, things started to turn around.</p>
        <p>''Most important, the reason crack is in remission is that for reasons still unclear, youngsters, especially those born after 1970, essentially avoided its use even though they are not very articulate about why,'' said Bruce D. Johnson, a director at the National Development and Research Institutes, a nonprofit organization.</p>
        <p>Federally financed drug tests of people arrested in Manhattan showed that among those 18 to 20 years old, 70 percent had crack or cocaine in their urine in 1988. In 1991 that figure had tumbled to 31 percent and in 1996 to 22 percent, where experts believe it to be now. People born before 1970 still tested positive in high percentages.</p>
        <p>''The major story was a major split in the use of crack,'' said Mr. Johnson. Why the generational division?</p>
        <p>One theory is rejection, the ''older-brother syndrome.'' Young people saw families destroyed, older brothers imprisoned, paralyzed by bullets, living on the streets. ''They said 'I don't want to be like that,' '' according to Mr. Travis. ''It was a self-protective, healthy instinct.''</p>
        <p>In addition, dealers discouraged crack use because their sellers were consuming profits. Community and church groups organized to fight the drug. And the country changed; it got wealthier, more conservative, less tolerant.</p>
        <p>In New York, the authorities mobilized. As Richard S. Curtis, professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, observed, ''The city reasserted itself.'' Police strategies broke up drug networks, forced dealers to go inside instead of hawking on the streets; more guns were confiscated.</p>
        <p>There is no doubt that many factors led to the changes, including effective law enforcement. But criminologists question how successful those would have been without community rejection of the crack culture.</p>
        <p>IN the late 1980's, Jeffrey Fagan, a professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, interviewed users and dealers. ''One of the things we heard almost immediately from the kids who were dealing was they would never use crack. They thought crackheads were the lowest form of humanity. Kids would speak about crack in the same way you and I as kids would talk about winos. The same rejection of the lifestyle.''</p>
        <p>Young people have not rejected drugs. Many, Professor Curtis said, shifted from crack to ''woolies,'' a cigarette of crack, marijuana and tobacco, then to ''blunts,'' cigarettes of marijuana and tobacco.</p>
        <p>Blunts, heroin and Ecstasy remain popular. Not great. But all are less expensive, and are not used as frequently as crack. The result is less disruption, less crime.</p>
        <p>Only recently have students of the drug culture had enough distance from the 1980's to be able to study dispassionately what happened to America's cities in those difficult years and what has happened since. As always, reality turns out to be much more complicated than the facile political pronouncement.</p>
