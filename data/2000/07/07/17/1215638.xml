        <p>Stephen Chao, the USA Cable president, just can't get a break when it comes to the World Wrestling Federation, which, after a prolonged court battle, won the right last month to pull its top-rated wrestling programs from the USA network and take them to Viacom's TNN and MTV networks.</p>
        <p>''When I had W.W.F., I spent time defending the show,'' Mr. Chao said after a meeting with reporters gathered at the Ritz-Carlton here. ''Now, I have to defend the fact that it's gone.''</p>

        <p>Stephen Chao, the USA Cable president, just can't get a break when it comes to the World Wrestling Federation, which, after a prolonged court battle, won the right last month to pull its top-rated wrestling programs from the USA network and take them to Viacom's TNN and MTV networks.</p>
        <p>''When I had W.W.F., I spent time defending the show,'' Mr. Chao said after a meeting with reporters gathered at the Ritz-Carlton here. ''Now, I have to defend the fact that it's gone.''</p>
        <p>That defense may become a fulltime job for Mr. Chao. Ever since USA lost the W.W.F., he and his fellow USA executives have been denying that losing the franchise would have any real effect on the network.</p>
        <p>Their public optimism has often seemed Orwellian. USA's W.W.F. editions are regularly the top-rated programs in primetime on cable, drawing audiences upwards of 7 million viewers. Monday night's ''Raw Is War'' program is the highest-rated show in all of cable television. No other show does nearly as well for USA, which is the No. 1 cable network in primetime.</p>
        <p>The USA executives have insisted that losing it will not be a problem because (a) they had a backup plan and (b) the show was not all that valuable anyway.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Chao disclosed that back-up plan: Instead of the immensely popular Monday night program, the cable channel will run movies. But could they possibly draw anywhere near the same audiences as wrestling?</p>
        <p>Maybe not, Mr. Chao acknowledged, but that does not matter. First of all, he said, USA did not make a large amount of money on wrestling because it had to split the profits with the W.W.F. Second, he said, the audience that watches wrestling does not necessarily watch USA's other shows, so promotional possibilities were limited.</p>
        <p>''It was really an oddball fit for us in the first place,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chao said network research showed that USA still came in first place in prime time, even without wrestling, though its leadership position was ''diminished.''</p>
