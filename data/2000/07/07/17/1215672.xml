        <p>Soumaila Samake is the only Nets player who runs sprints with a smile. He is also the only 7-foot-1-inch center who sprints out in front of the other players.</p>
        <p>''If he's trying to prove something, he's doing it,'' Coach Byron Scott said on Friday. ''To have a big guy outrun everybody in suicides is impressive.''</p>
        <p>To have him grinning while doing it is remarkable. ''We call him 'Smiley,' '' Scott said. ''You can make him run 20 suicides and when he finishes, he's still smiling.''</p>
        <p>Samake does not smile because he enjoys the muscle burn, or the Antarctic blast of the air-conditioning at Champion Center, or because he is cocky or because he is perpetually happy. Samake smiles out of habit, one he learned from his mother, Mariam, growing up on a farm in Bougouni, Mali, in West Africa. ''I'm like that,'' he said, shrugging his shoulders and demonstrating his natural talent.</p>
        <p>This is Samake's second year in the United States, but his fifth year away from his parents and three siblings. At 17, he left to play professional basketball in Slovenia, and after three seasons he came to Cincinnati to play in the International Basketball League. Monday night, the soft-spoken 22-year-old will be in Boston with the rest of the Nets' rookies and free-agent hopefuls, as their makeshift team plays a similar group from the San Antonio Spurs in the Shaw's Pro Summer League. If Samake has experienced culture shock, moving from Africa to Slovenia to the United States, he never shows it.</p>
        <p>''I want to show them I can play ball,'' he said in the third language he has learned -- his native dialect is Bambara and he also speaks French.</p>
        <p>In the four days of minicamp last week, the Nets coaches saw encouraging signs from their second-round pick, whom they drafted for his defense and shot-blocking. ''He's just raw,'' Scott said. ''He doesn't understand the game completely right now. He has a lot of pluses -- he's long, he's athletic, he can run, he shoots the ball well. He did make a couple of defensive things happen, like he helped on a pick-and-roll situation, and then he got back and blocked a shot.</p>
        <p>''You're looking at a guy who has some talent. If he develops, gains some weight, gets stronger and gets some post-up moves, he'll be pretty good.''</p>
        <p>Samake's listed height and weight -- 7-2, 230 pounds -- might have gained a little in the metric conversion. ''I'm 7-1 and 225 pounds,'' he said, acknowledging he would like to get to 250.</p>
        <p>Besides yearning to play in the National Basketball Association, Samake has another reason to make the Nets' roster -- to support his family in Mali. His 28-year-old brother, who is 6-6, is tending to the donkeys, cows, goats and chickens on the farm. His 17-year-old brother and his father are also tall (6-8 and 6-5). Samake said his parents are still unclear about what he does in the United States. ''They don't know that much about basketball. I'm just telling them how important it is -- how much money I can send back to them.''</p>
        <p>Samake began playing basketball in high school, prodded by his schoolmates because of his height. Four years ago he was selected to play for the national team. Despite being recruited by the University of Wyoming, Samake decided to turn pro to play in Europe.</p>
        <p>In Cincinnati last season, Samake averaged 9.7 points, 7.6 rebounds and 2.7 blocks a game.</p>
        <p>Samake arrived in this country with knowledge of the N.B.A. from watching championship games while growing up. Dennis Rodman became his favorite player. ''For his game,'' Samake said quickly.</p>
        <p>If Samake improves his game in time to make the Nets this season, he might eventually consider buying a new house for his family. ''And maybe some more animals for them,'' he said with a nod, and, for once, a distant smile.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The Nets completed their summer league roster on Sunday, cutting five players: forward DOUG SMITH, a first-round draft pick of the Dallas Mavericks in 1991; the former Providence center MARTY CONLON; and guards RONNIE FIELDS, RAYMOND TUTT and RON SELLEAZE.</p>
