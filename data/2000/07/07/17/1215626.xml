        <p>Alteon Websystems, a player in a fiercely contested segment of the Internet industry, is expected to raise the competitive heat with the announcement today of new technology for managing data traffic on the Web.</p>
        <p>Alteon, based in San Jose, Calif., will offer a system called an integrated service director, which is designed to enable companies conducting electronic commerce to build the efficiency and speed of their transactions.</p>
        <p>Among the benefits, the company says, will be making encryption and decryption of online transactions faster, a capability in huge demand as e-business becomes more commonplace.</p>
        <p>A part of the new equipment will be the so-called Akamaizer, which prepares content to be used on networks assembled by Akamai Technologies of Cambridge, Mass. Akamai has a worldwide network that allows companies to distribute material efficiently over the Internet to farflung users.</p>
        <p>When yoked to other Web-switching equipment, Alteon's new technology is expected to allow companies to process secure transactions about 10 times faster than other systems, the company said.</p>
        <p>With today's announcement, the company will be stoking the competition in an industry that pits start-ups like Alteon and Foundry Networks against established networking companies like Cisco Systems. In May, the industry was rocked by Cisco's $6 billion acquisition of ArrowPoint Communications, the top competitor to four-year-old Alteon.</p>
        <p>''Anything that allows you to make your online transactions more efficient will provide your company with the opportunity to have sales that are greater and more varied,'' said Eric Thompson, an analyst in the enterprise networking group at Gartner Group/DataQuest, a research and consulting firm. ''It looks like Alteon will breathe more energy into e-commerce transactions with this new technology.''</p>
        <p>Anticipation of the new technology, combined with favorable forecasts on its financial performance, have also breathed life into Alteon's stock recently. In the last month, the company's shares have climbed more than 50 percent to close at $112 on Friday. Alteon said last week that it would surpass analysts' revenue and earnings expectations for its second-quarter results, scheduled for this week.</p>
        <p>''The Internet would not become what dot-com dreamers want it to be without a company like Alteon,'' said Paul Johnson, a managing director at Robertson, Stephens covering the networking and telecommunications industries. ''With Alteon the type of advice I provide is, if you own a house, sell the house and buy this stock.''</p>
