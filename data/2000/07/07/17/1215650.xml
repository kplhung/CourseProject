        <p>Rafael Gimenez predicted the outcome of Mexico's presidential elections with great accuracy, but few Mexicans knew because his newspaper refused to publish his polls indicating that Vicente Fox was leading the race.</p>
        <p>Ricardo de la Pena was accused by a colleague of violating professional ethics after he produced a survey showing Mr. Fox with a healthy lead over the candidate from the party that governed Mexico for 71 years. And Maria de las Heras, a third Mexican pollster, received phone threats after her nationwide poll two weeks before the July 2 vote showed Mr. Fox winning by a wide margin.</p>
        <p>Before the elections, officials of the Institutional Revolution Party, the governing party, known as the PRI, pressured editors and producers not to publish or broadcast surveys showing Mr. Fox in the lead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gimenez and at least one other pollster were sidelined at newspapers after producing such surveys. And most of the polls published just before a final deadline two weeks ahead of the vote showed Francisco Labastida, the governing party candidate, leading by a three-  to four-point margin.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Fox's victory by seven percentage points stunned nearly everyone, even Mr. Labastida, who had hired a well-known Washington pollster, Stanley Greenberg, to produce his campaign surveys. Several of Mr. Greenberg's polls, which were given wide publicity here, showed Mr. Labastida with a sweeping lead, and none ever showed Mr. Fox ahead.</p>
        <p>According to the offical returns, Mr. Fox received 44 percent of the votes and Mr. Labastida 37 percent.</p>
        <p>Now a debate is under way here about whether many respected pollsters erred or whether millions of voters changed their minds at the last minute. Some, including Mr. Greenberg, said most of the millions of Mexican voters who were counted as undecided chose Mr. Fox once in the polling booth. Others said fear of the governing party prevented voters from confiding their real intentions.</p>
        <p>The July 2 exit polls by the newspaper Reforma accurately predicted the result, but its influential polls during the previous months never showed Mr. Fox in the lead. Alejandro Moreno, Reforma's chief pollster, said many of the governing party's hard-core supporters, disciplined voters in previous balloting, had stayed home on Election Day.</p>
        <p>Ms. de las Heras, who over a decade has conducted many polls on contract to the governing party, said its tactic of giving away washing machines and other items to supporters distorted surveys because many voters told pollsters they intended to vote for the party in hopes of receiving a gift.</p>
        <p>Ms. de las Heras's survey in mid-June, which was privately financed, showed Mr. Fox with 44 percent and Mr. Labastida with 34 percent. It was not published in Mexico, but The Dallas Morning News reported its findings in an article on June 21. She was interviewed that morning by Mexican talk show hosts astonished over her conclusions.</p>
        <p>''Then suddenly my phone went silent,'' she recalled. ''The PRI put out the order to the radio and TV stations: bury that witch!''</p>
        <p>In the following days, she received several anonymous letters and calls accusing her of being a traitor, she said.</p>
        <p>Virtually every poll published in Mexico that showed Mr. Fox in the lead provoked a stir. The first, by Mr. de la Pena, was financed by a consortium of parties including the PRI. He caused an uproar when he reported in February that Mr. Fox was leading -- with almost exactly the percentages that emerged in the election.</p>
        <p>Governing party officials criticized Mr. de la Pena's techniques to his face and ridiculed him behind his back.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gimenez, who has a master's degree in survey research techniques from the University of Connecticut, was treated more harshly. In January, February and March, his polls in the newspaper Milenio showed Mr. Fox running strong, and Mr. Gimenez told associates in April that a new survey would show Mr. Fox taking the lead. But those results were never published; instead, Milenio announced that he had been replaced, and its new survey showing Mr. Labastida ahead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gimenez was later hired to do surveys for Mr. Fox's center-right party, and his final poll in late June showed Mr. Fox with 43 percent, Mr. Labastida with 38 and the third major candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, with 17. Those results turned out to be more accurate even than some exit polls.</p>
        <p>''All of us who concluded that Fox was going to win were made to suffer,'' Mr. Gimenez said. ''The PRI discredited all of us, saying we were careless, inept or sold out. So the election took the PRI by surprise.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Labastida said in a television interview last week that he never dreamed he could lose until exit polls announced Mr. Fox's victory.</p>
