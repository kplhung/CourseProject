        <p>''Martin Guerre'' didn't make it to Broadway last season. ''Oklahoma!'' is no longer coming next season. ''Cats'' is closing. So is ''Miss Saigon.''

Maybe the age of the megamusical has come and gone. Gone, too, perhaps is the age of the maverick producer. Or has Sir Cameron, 53, simply lost the touch?</p>

        <p>''Martin Guerre'' didn't make it to Broadway last season. ''Oklahoma!'' is no longer coming next season. ''Cats'' is closing. So is ''Miss Saigon.'' ''Putting It Together'' did not last earlier this year. And whether there will be a future for ''The Witches of Eastwick,'' which opens in London tomorrow night, is anyone's guess.</p>
        <p>Whither Cameron Mackintosh, the guiding force behind them all? The boyish British producer who brought Broadway one long-running blockbuster after another in the 1980's and early 90's -- ''Cats,'' ''Miss Saigon,'' ''The Phantom of the Opera'' and ''Les Miserables'' -- is not turning them out as he used to. Maybe the age of the megamusical has come and gone. Gone, too, perhaps is the age of the maverick producer. Or has Sir Cameron, 53, simply lost the touch?</p>
        <p>''He's had a tough 10 years,'' said Gordon Davidson, artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. ''But he's indefatigable.''</p>
        <p>Along Broadway he has a legion of admirers who don't doubt that sooner or later he will be back with another hit; he still hopes to bring his acclaimed revival of ''Oklahoma!'' across the Atlantic next summer. ''He's really the only giant we have left in our business,'' said Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters. ''Cameron is the last singular idiosyncratic producer.''</p>
        <p>In recent interviews in London and by phone from New York, Sir Cameron did not seem particularly concerned about the state of his career. The Sunday Times of London lists him as one of Britain's 200 richest people, estimating his personal wealth at $600 million. He owns seven theaters in the West End of London. He was knighted in 1996 for his services to British theater. ''When it's meant to stop, I can do other things,'' he said, sipping tea in his London office of overstuffed couches and oriental rugs. ''I'm not in any way wedded to doing theater for the rest of my life.''</p>
        <p>Talking to Sir Cameron one gets the feeling he might be ready to hang it up, spend more time at his estate in Scotland, the vineyard in the South of France, that dairy farm in Somerset, England.  ''We make very nice cheddar,'' he said. ''We raise our own sheep. All of that I find equally satisfying.''</p>
        <p>''Life is for living,'' he added at another point. ''Life isn't just for musical theater.''</p>
        <p>Speaking by telephone a few days ago he sounded confident about his musical ''Witches,'' derived from John Updike's novel and written by two young Americans, John Dempsey and Dana P. Rowe. ''I'm enjoying it, the cast is having a good time, audiences seem to like it,'' Sir Cameron said. ''Now we need several good reviews.''</p>
        <p>But ''Witches'' and ''Oklahoma!,'' while ambitious, are clearly shows of a different order from his earlier extravaganzas in which chandeliers crash, helicopters land, barricades revolve and tires rise. Economics comes into play. ''Phantom of the Opera,'' which cost about $8 million when it was originally produced in 1988, would cost nearly twice that now. The expense of taking big shows on the road, where much of the profit resides, have escalated as well.</p>
        <p>''Costs being a great factor, the spectacle of those musicals is very difficult to continue, except for someone like Disney,'' said Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, which owns the theaters that house Sir Cameron's Broadway productions.</p>
        <p>''They really represented a golden age,'' he added. ''Now it is winding down.'' (''Miss Saigon'' and ''Cats'' are to close before the end of the year.)</p>
        <p>Sir Cameron said he was not preoccupied with his dwindling presence on Broadway. ''When I grew up wanting to put on shows and musicals, I never dreamt any would run 5 years, let alone 9 or 10 or even 20,'' he said. ''To have any sense of sadness would be stupid, and because they're good shows, they will appear in other guises forever. I would much rather go out still being thought of as good shows rather than faded replicas.''</p>
        <p>Born in Enfield, in north London, the son of a timber merchant who played the trumpet and a secretary, Sir Cameron fell in love with theater at age 8, when his aunt took him to see ''Salad Days,'' a musical by Julian Slade and Dorothy Reynolds. His first theater job was as an apprentice stagehand at the Theater Royal Drury Lane, during the run of ''Camelot'' in 1965. ''Miss Saigon'' recently closed at that theater (not one of his), and ''Witches'' is now ensconced there.</p>
        <p>After he worked as a stagehand and stage manager, Sir Cameron's first big West End production was a revival of ''Anything Goes'' in 1969, which flopped. His first hit came in 1976, when he invested in the revue ''Side by Side by Sondheim,'' which came to New York.</p>
        <p>Sir Cameron said he was disappointed that his revival of ''Oklahoma!'' would not come to New York this year, a decision announced 10 days ago, citing scheduling difficulties involving the show's production team. ''There isn't enough time to do it properly,'' he said. ''That's not the way I produce things, in a hurry.''</p>
        <p>In particular the show has been trying to work around the schedule of Sir Trevor, who is artistic director of the Royal National Theater in London. Other members of the production team include Susan Stroman as choreographer and Anthony Ward as set designer. Plans to bring ''Oklahoma!'' were canceled once before, when the Actors Equity Association refused Sir Cameron's request to bring the all-British cast to Broadway last year. For the production that was supposed to come this season, he had agreed to try to cast American actors. (In a similar showdown, Sir Cameron successfully insisted that Jonathan Pryce play the Eurasian narrator in ''Miss Saigon'' despite Equity's calls for an Asian actor.) Sir Cameron said that he hoped the show would make it to New York in about a year.</p>
        <p>Sir Cameron disputed a report that the problem with ''Oklahoma!'' had to do with the amount that SFX Theatrical Group was asking for the Ford Center for the Performing Arts. ''I'm sure a deal would have been sorted out,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As to why ''Martin Guerre'' never made it to New York, Sir Cameron said that musical, which received poor reviews out of town, was a difficult challenge. Based on a 1982 film and the 16th-century case history about a soldier returning from war, the musical had been about four years in the making. Sir Cameron said even he turned it down at first. ''It took me a long time to get into the subject matter,'' he said. ''I couldn't see what was intriguing about it.''</p>
        <p>Gradually, Sir Cameron said, he came to understand what the authors -- Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil, who also wrote ''Les Miz'' and ''Miss Saigon'' -- were trying to accomplish. ''I'm a huge admirer of both of them,'' Sir Cameron said. ''I made a fortune beyond my dreams on two of their shows. My misgivings about it initially were how you tell the story, which has been the practical search for the authors.''</p>
        <p>Sir Cameron is a hands-on producer who works closely with his creative team -- asking questions, making suggestions -- and then checks in regularly during rehearsals.</p>
        <p>''Everything is produced by committee these days,'' Mr. Landesman said. ''There are very few producers who have their own personal imprint on their shows.''</p>
        <p>Sir Cameron said it was important not to hand a project to a director too quickly, that he prided himself on being able to prod the writers to do their best work. And when he does turn a show over, he said, it's like letting a child venture forth into the world. ''I'm not in charge anymore,'' he said of ''Witches.'' ''I had to pass the baton.''</p>
        <p>He makes no secret of preferring old-fashioned like ''South Pacific'' and ''Oliver!'' He will revive ''My Fair Lady'' in the West End next season, with his longtime colleague Trevor Nunn directing. It is ''arguably the greatest book musical ever written,'' he said. ''Every note is perfect.''</p>
        <p>He said that he was rarely attracted to anything that did not have a strong dramatic theme, and that the work he did was almost always based on classics.</p>
        <p>His love of the conventional may seem difficult to reconcile with his love of Stephen Sondheim's work. But there is darker Sondheim (''Passion''), and there is lighter Sondheim (''Putting It Together''), and Sir Cameron does not profess to like it all. ''He's one of my closest friends,'' he said of Sondheim. ''Could I produce all his other shows? I don't have the personality that has a rapport with some of the characters he writes about.''</p>
        <p>After seeing ''Company,'' for example, Sir Cameron said he loved the score but not its effect on him. ''I couldn't understand why, having been so theatrically excited, I came out of the theater feeling gutted,'' he said. ''One of my strong suits is I still care as much.''</p>
        <p>It is that caring, producers say, that suggests that Sir Cameron will be around the theater for some time to come.</p>
        <p>''The fact that a few things he has done haven't worked out doesn't mean anything,'' said Roger Berlind, a longtime Broadway producer. ''He's an extraordinary showman. He ain't going away.''</p>
