        <p>The United States men's national team began regional qualifying matches for the 2002 World Cup today by snatching a draw from the jaws of victory. Conceding a goal in the 87th minute, the Americans were sent home with a 1-1 tie against lightly regarded Guatemala.</p>
        <p>''We are very disappointed in the result,'' Coach Bruce Arena said. ''And I am not happy with my team's effort.''</p>
        <p>''We did a lot of dumb things, for sure,'' goalkeeper Kasey Keller said.</p>
        <p>The match showcased two vastly different United States teams -- one confident and poised, the other scrambling for cover. After thoroughly dominating the first half, the United States faded badly in the second, allowing the Guatemalan attack to compress the Americans' defense and fire away at will.</p>
        <p>Sparked by the dynamic play of David Regis, Claudio Reyna and Chris Armas, the United States looked as if it could do no wrong in the first half.</p>
        <p>Crisp passes and clever ball movement allowed forward Ante Razov to repeatedly penetrate -- and ultimately capitalize upon -- a three-man Guatemalan back line. When Reyna and Razov finally combined in the 45th minute with a nice drop pass that split the defense, even the crowd seemed to sense that this might not be the home side's day.</p>
        <p>But the second half was a wholly different story, with Guatemala getting an energizing boost from forward Freddy Garcia, who promptly began shredding the American's left side. Gone were the tight crosses and swift counters that characterized the first half.</p>
        <p>''We don't have any excuses,'' defender Robin Fraser said. ''We just didn't defend as well as we could have.''</p>
        <p>''Conceding a goal late is the difference between a great team and a good team,'' Keller said. ''It was the little things that we didn't do that gave them opportunities.''</p>
        <p>Heat was clearly a factor. Staged in a rural city some 120 miles west of Guatemala City, Mazatenango was a curious choice for a qualifier, especially since Guatemala usually enjoys a distinct advantage in its capital -- altitude -- and would have drawn 35,000 fans to the national stadium instead of the 8,511 who could be shoehorned into tiny Luis Salazar Stadium.</p>
        <p>But the site proved to be a provident choice as the game was played in sweltering temperatures that had the Americans wilting.</p>
        <p>''I know I hit the wall,'' Keller said.</p>
        <p>Carlos Ruiz made them pay for those lapses when he converted a ball chested down into the 6-yard box by Dwight Pezzarossi. A quality strike, it also preserved Guatemala's hopes for the later rounds. As Coach Julio Cesar Cortez said, ''We had many opportunities, but it was only when it became urgent that we were able to come through.''</p>
        <p>The result gives the United States 1 point and raises the stakes for its next match, Sunday in Costa Rica. Historically a hostile environment for the United States, the Americans must now regroup and hope to find their 3 road points there.</p>
        <p>There were some positives to be taken away: the United States team looks much tougher and crisper than it has looked at times in the past. Reyna has blossomed into a true playmaker, but he, too, wilted in the closing stages. And it is difficult to overlook the impact of the loss of Eddie Pope to an injury in the 76th minute. Without the lanky defender, the United States' back line simply fell apart.</p>
        <p>And today's result surely bothers the United States players. ''We just gave away 2 points,'' Razov said.</p>
        <p>How costly that could be remains to be seen. The top two finishers in the group will advance to a six nation Concacaf regional finals next year. From that will come three qualifiers for the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea.</p>
        <p>The United States, which went from 1950 to 1990 without appearing in soccer's biggest event, is trying to qualify for a fourth straight time.</p>
