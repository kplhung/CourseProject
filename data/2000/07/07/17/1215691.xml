        <p>Nielsen Media Research, the television ratings company, had a problem. Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language broadcaster, wanted credit for a larger audience than Nielsen was reporting.</p>
        <p>But executives at most of the English-language stations reasoned that if Nielsen added more Spanish-speaking households, their programs stood to lose ratings points to programs on Spanish-language television. With lower ratings, the stations would have to charge less for commercials. The executives feared losing up to $50 million in advertising in New York City each year.</p>

        <p>Nielsen Media Research, the television ratings company, had a problem. Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language broadcaster, wanted credit for a larger audience than Nielsen was reporting.</p>
        <p>But executives at most of the English-language stations reasoned that if Nielsen added more Spanish-speaking households, their programs stood to lose ratings points to programs on Spanish-language television. With lower ratings, the stations would have to charge less for commercials. The executives feared losing up to $50 million in advertising in New York City each year.</p>
        <p>Nielsen, whose officials estimated that they were undercounting Spanish-speakers in the New York City market by about 300,000 households, was worried about its credibility. So last year, company officials called a meeting of New York television executives to talk about the Spanish-language sample.</p>
        <p>According to interviews with participants, the meeting was contentious. The executives at the English-language stations were not happy.  They disputed Nielsen's findings -- that Spanish speakers make up 8 percent of the television viewers in the New York market -- complaining that the company's survey had used faulty sampling techniques. Executives at Univision dismissed those complaints as stalling tactics.</p>
        <p>Dennis Swanson, the president and general manager of NBC's New York affiliate, WNBC, asked half-jokingly at the meeting: ''Can't they wait for a couple of years until I retire?''</p>
        <p>The struggle over how to count Spanish speakers in the Nielsen ratings is another indication of the rapidly growing influence of Hispanics on American culture and business.</p>
        <p>For years, Spanish-language television was a backwater of the broadcast industry. Nielsen did not even calculate ratings for Hispanic programs until 1992. But the growth of America's Hispanic population has changed the landscape.</p>
        <p>''As more and more Hispanics have come to the United States it has become more complicated,'' said Harry R. Stecker, the Nielsen executive who manages the ratings system for local television stations. ''We might have the right number of households that are Hispanic by origin in our sample, but we do not have the right number of people who primarily speak Spanish.''</p>
        <p>The problem was that the sample included too many Hispanics who spoke English primarily.</p>
        <p>Nielsen officials admit undercounting Spanish speakers in almost every major market with a large Hispanic population. Naturally, Univision, which has affiliates across the country, wanted action.</p>
        <p>''Ratings are the real problem, because they are the real currency of the broadcast industry,'' said Michael Wortsman, the president of Univision's national station group. ''Nielsen is discounting our currency because it is using an inaccurate system.''</p>
        <p>Hispanics are the fastest growing segment of the American population and are close to overtaking blacks as the nation's largest minority. There are more than 32 million Hispanics in the United States, compared with 23 million 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>''The growth of Hispanic immigrants in New York has just been astronomical in the past three years,'' said Andrew Beveridge, a demographics expert and sociology professor at Queens College. Given that, he said, ''It makes a lot of sense to distinguish those who primarily speak Spanish.''</p>
        <p>Reaching Hispanic consumers has become more important to advertisers. The estimated annual buying power of Hispanics is expected to surpass $440 billion this year, according to federal statistics. In the New York television market, the nation's largest, Nielsen estimates that Hispanics make up more than 1 million of the 6.8 million households with televisions. If Nielsen's estimates are right, Spanish is the dominant language in about 500,000 of those households.</p>
        <p>Investors seem to believe in the strength of Univision's market and its business model. The company's stock has jumped to about $110 per share, compared with $54 a year ago.</p>
        <p>But the Nielsen numbers, Univision officials say, have not kept up with the demographic changes.</p>
        <p>At one time or another, nearly every broadcaster complains about Nielsen's ratings numbers. But in this case, Univision officials were able to get Nielsen's attention.</p>
        <p>Nielsen's field agents conducted door-to-door surveys to estimate the New York area's Spanish-speaking population. (Mr. Stecker, the Nielsen executive, said that his company could not use federal census data because it was 10 years old and did not include the necessary information about language preference.)</p>
        <p>Based on the results from the survey, Nielsen estimated that Spanish-dominant households should be represented by 43 of the 500 households in the New York area that have television-viewing meters; there are now only 21 Spanish-dominant households in the sample.</p>
        <p>But local English-language broadcasters are fighting hard against the changes, which would include removing meters from English-language households. They contend that Nielsen's estimate of the size of the Spanish-speaking population was biased by leading questions and by beginning the interviews with Hispanics in Spanish.</p>
        <p>Nielsen now concedes those problems and attributes them to insufficient research into Spanish-language polling techniques. The company plans to compile new estimates, but still contends that Spanish speakers are underrepresented.</p>
        <p>Although Nielsen originally wanted to begin increasing the number of Spanish-dominant households in the New York sample last September, that was delayed because of the complaints about the surveys. The plan was again delayed in January.</p>
        <p>''There are two sides to every story,'' Mr. Swanson of WNBC said in an interview. ''But, ultimately, these are difficult issues because of the money that is at stake.''</p>
        <p>The networks have watched their ratings drift downward in recent years, in part because of the growth of cable and of niche television stations. Gone are the days when CBS's ''Cosby Show'' could rank No. 1 among black, white and Hispanic viewers.</p>
        <p>Even under the current Nielsen counting system, Univision's New York affiliate, WXTV Channel 41, has been consistently beating UPN's New York affiliate, WWOR Channel 9, and occasionally beating the major networks in important time slots.</p>
        <p>In the May sweeps, the Nielsen ratings reported that an average of 144,375 households were tuned into WXTV from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays (a rating of 2.1).</p>
        <p>But a separate Nielsen service, called the Hispanic Ratings Index, which Nielsen set up in 1995 as a compromise between English-language stations and Univision officials clamoring for changes in the ratings, reported that 236,168 households tuned in, for a 3.4 rating, during the same time period.</p>
        <p>The February sweeps numbers provide a telling example of how the count affects Univision.</p>
        <p>In February, the Hispanic Index reported that WXTV's 6:30 p.m. newscast, ''Noticiero Univision,'' beat ''NBC Nightly News,'' ''ABC World News Tonight'' and ''The CBS Evening News With Dan Rather'' among adults 18 to 49. In Nielsen's general ratings, ''Noticiero Univision'' finished behind all those programs except ''The CBS Evening News.''</p>
        <p>''It is like going to the bank and getting a report that says you have 10 dollars and 10 million dollars in the same account, at the same time,'' said Cristina Scwartz, the general manager of WXTV. ''They both can't be right.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Scwartz says that Mr. Swanson ''knows that his market is not a wide English-speaking audience.''</p>
        <p>''He has put together programs that reach out to Hispanic audiences, and I can't say that about everyone,'' she said.</p>
        <p>WNBC recently won the rights to broadcast the National Puerto Rican Day Parade. It has a number of Hispanic reporters, manages a Hispanic scholarship fund and refused to rerun an episode of ''Seinfeld'' that was offensive to many Hispanic viewers.</p>
        <p>But WNBC officials acknowledge they are able to reach only a limited segment of the Hispanic audience. ''We are not going to do Spanish-language programming,'' Mr. Swanson said. ''That is not the business we are in.'' That is why, he says, he is so concerned that any increase is accurate.</p>
        <p>Univision officials said they were concerned that the delays were an attempt to get Nielsen to revise its estimates of the percentage of Spanish-dominant households in the market.</p>
        <p>''Yes, they are right in taking into consideration those concerns,'' Mimi Berry, the research director at WXTV, said of Nielsen. ''But why not start the process of beginning to correct the sample numbers now and then re-evaluate the estimates? Let's get it started now, instead of two years from now.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Stecker, of Nielsen, said that Univision officials did not need to worry about English-language broadcasters' weakening the company's resolve, even though some of the English-language broadcasters had initially threatened to stop using the service. (They have threatened in the past to create their own ratings service, a notion that is considered unlikely given the high costs.)</p>
        <p>''I don't really react to threats, because I wouldn't be doing my job if I did,'' Mr. Stecker said. He said that the company had not been cautious out of fear, but because it was ''measuring a medium that involves a lot of complexity and that is going through rapid changes.''</p>
        <p>He added that Univision officials could be guaranteed there would soon be some changes. ''We know how important the data is, how it is used and how much money is allocated because of it,'' he said. ''But we have to take the high road and do the right thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stecker said Nielsen would begin adding meters in Spanish-dominant New York homes, installing at least five meters -- representing more than 60,000 households -- in September.</p>
