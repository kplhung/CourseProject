        <p>The Giants are leaning toward releasing cornerback Conrad Hamilton before training camp opens Friday because they are unsure when he will fully recover from a right knee injury.</p>
        <p>If the Giants open camp with Hamilton in the fold, they will be obligated to pay his 2000 salary, scheduled to be $440,000, with nearly $1 million in incentive bonuses. But if Hamilton fails the team's physical, his salary comes off the Giants' salary cap and the team could use that money to sign another veteran cornerback should one become available.</p>
        <p>Hamilton, 25, first injured the knee in a scrimmage last August. The injury was originally diagnosed as an ankle sprain, then as a knee sprain. He eventually sought a second opinion and was told he had injured a knee tendon. Hamilton missed all but the final three games of the season, then had surgery on his knee in the off-season. He became a free agent and signed a three-year deal on Feb. 10.</p>
        <p>The surgery kept Hamilton out of the team's minicamps this spring and a two-week passing camp in June, but the plan was for him to be cleared medically by July and be prepared to go to camp. Hamilton was designated the likely starter at left cornerback, replacing Phillippi Sparks, a free agent the Giants chose not to pursue.</p>
        <p>But Hamilton's recovery has been slower than the team anticipated. He has not proven to team officials he will be able to participate in training camp drills this weekend, nor is the team sure when he will be able to take part.</p>
        <p>Coaches and team executives will meet this week to determine Hamilton's future with the Giants. But there are indications that most favor cutting him rather than taking the risk he will not recover in time to contribute significantly this year.</p>
        <p>Dave Thomas, a free agent from Jacksonville signed in the winter, becomes the first-string left cornerback, a post he occupied in Hamilton's absence during drills earlier this year.</p>
