        <p>The pain still sears in Kevin Williams's memory, but the blur of days spent in intensive care last year has faded, his renewed health brought back into focus by the two interceptions he pulled in during the first day of Jets practice.</p>
        <p>It was a telling demonstration for a free safety who struggled to breathe on his own 10 months ago and is now competing with Omar Stoutmire and Scott Frost for a starting job. Williams grabbed a pass by Ray Lucas and another by Chad Pennington on Friday, and it was as if he had clutched his chest and squeezed out the agony caused by an infection that had nestled there and nearly ended his life.</p>
        <p>''I think about it every day, to be down where I was and be able to come back,'' Williams said. ''It was a pain I can't explain. I've had injuries. I've had neck sprains. I've had broken legs. This was more pain than I could ever imagine. I knew something was totally out of control. I knew I was close to dying because I know you shouldn't have to hurt that bad just to live.''</p>
        <p>Williams, 24, picked up the airborne virus during a trip to Denver in the fourth week of the 1999 season and, perhaps exacerbated by the altitude, it rapidly settled in his throat and lungs. Heavily sedated and breathing with the help of a respirator, Williams hovered in a fog, undergoing several procedures to remove fluid from his throat and lungs, the team unsure what had made him so sick.</p>
        <p>Williams's agent, Jerome Stanley, accused the Jets of callousness in their handling of Williams because Coach Bill Parcells did not call Williams's mother and the Jets did not pay him his full salary at that time.</p>
        <p>The Jets, concerned that other players might catch whatever had felled Williams, would not let his teammates see him, and when they finally did, Williams had lost 40 pounds off his 6-foot, 190-pound frame. Williams, who had started six games as a rookie in 1998, wondered if he would ever return to football.</p>
        <p>''From the time I woke up, I wondered, but that wasn't the most important thing,'' Williams said. ''Everybody looked at me funny because I had lost a lot of weight. I told them: 'I lost a lot of weight, but I've got my life. That's more than any weight I could ever lose. I've got me.' ''</p>
        <p>Williams is not bitter toward the Jets and believes that Parcells -- who delayed putting Williams on the nonfootball illness list until the sixth week of the season, enabling him to gain another year toward free agency -- was just doing his job. Parcells greeted Williams on the sideline after Friday's practice and told him he was happy to have him back.</p>
        <p>Now, Williams is completing a comeback that began, he said, when he was released from intensive care and began to regain his strength. Against doctors' wishes, he began to do little things to push himself back into shape more quickly, and his progress has astonished those who saw him at his lowest moment.</p>
        <p>''Nothing is making me happier than seeing Kevin Williams on the field,'' said Elliot Pellman, the chairman of the Jets' medical department.</p>
        <p>Williams, who was released from his doctors' care in February, spent part of the off-season visiting children's hospitals, and he says he feels acutely the pain of children in poor health. He is reminded regularly of the fragility of life when he hears the stories of professional football players like Eric Turner, the Oakland Raiders defensive back who died of cancer, and Fred Lane, the Indianapolis Colts running back who died of a gunshot wound.</p>
        <p>Williams came perilously close to such a fate but says he is back to complete health. There is nothing that he is unable to do, he said. He, of course, had proven that months ago.</p>
        <p>''I know how easy it is, how things happen and nobody ever knows the reason,'' Williams said. ''If you can make it out of it, you try to find the good out of it. I'm not asking why; I don't know why it happened to me. If it was to help somebody else, that's fine, because I'm all right.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>GREG LOTYSZ, the backup left offensive tackle, will have a magnetic resonance imaging test on Monday to determine the extent of the injury to his left knee that he sustained Saturday. Coach AL GROH said ''it is not a short-term injury,'' and Lotysz's knee was in a full brace Sunday. IAN RAFFERTY, the backup right tackle, will also back up JASON FABINI at left tackle. The starting left guard, KERRY JENKINS, will also practice at left tackle. . . . The defensive coordinator, MIKE NOLAN, the former Giants defensive coordinator who endured a difficult year last season under the Washington Redskins' owner, DANIEL SNYDER, said he had been rejuvenated since joining the Jets in February. ''Seven years ago I was Boy Wonder in New York and last year I was just the opposite,'' Nolan said. ''I certainly didn't think I was Boy Wonder then and I certainly didn't think I was as bad last year.''. . . . Defensive end ANTHONY COOK, who signed on Saturday, practiced Sunday, and defensive end SHANE BURTON, who missed the first two days with a broken toe, practiced.</p>
