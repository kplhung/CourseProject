        <p>Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have yet to meet face-to-face in a debate, but they gave voters a chance today for the first time to make a side-by-side comparison as the two sat for hourlong interviews on network television.</p>
        <p>The vice president faced aggressive questioning from Tim Russert of NBC's ''Meet the Press'' on his record and past statements, while the Texas governor was asked questions of a more political nature by Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts on ABC's ''This Week.''</p>
        <p>Neither candidate revealed anything about his vice-presidential selection process. Mr. Bush said that while Gen. Colin Powell was not interested in the vice presidency, he might accept another post. Speculation has centered on secretary of state.</p>
        <p>The questioning highlighted some stark differences between the candidates, for example on Social Security, the death penalty and abortion. The side-by-side comparison also showed that Mr. Gore's 25 years in public office left him with a deep familiarity with issues, but also with a lengthy record that could be examined for consistency.</p>
        <p>The interviews also underscored the political needs of each candidate as the campaign headed toward the  conventions. Mr. Bush, who leads in the polls, seemed content to keep the conversation vague, a posture that could allow voters to read what they want to into him. Mr. Gore, on the other hand, has been eager for direct debates with Mr. Bush. His advisers contend that once voters can compare Mr. Gore's grasp of policy and his center-left positions with what they say is Mr. Bush's right-wing bent, Mr. Gore will win the election.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the third party candidates, Ralph Nader and Patrick J. Buchanan, also appeared on talk programs. Mr. Nader said on CBS's ''Face the Nation'' that he was not worried about siphoning votes from Mr. Gore, even if it could cost Mr. Gore the presidency.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't be running if I were worried about taking votes away from Al Gore or George W. Bush,'' Mr. Nader said. ''Nobody is entitled to votes. They have to earn them.''</p>
        <p>On the same program, Mr. Buchanan was asked whether Mr. Bush might choose a running mate who favored abortion rights. ''Mr. Bush is blowing smoke,'' Mr. Buchanan said. ''He would have an explosion at his convention.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore underwent scrutiny of his Social Security plan. Mr. Russert said repeatedly that Mr. Gore's proposal was based on a rosy assumption that anticipated budget surpluses for the next 40 years. Mr. Gore said his plan would keep the Social Security trust fund sacrosanct and, by eliminating the national debt by 2012, would help extend the life of the entitlement program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russert noted that the Clinton-Gore budget for 2000 had proposed increasing the money for Social Security by investing some of the budget surplus set aside for Social Security ''in corporate equities or other private financial instruments.'' Mr. Russert described the difference between the two candidates' approaches this way, ''You want the government to invest in the market; George Bush wants individuals to invest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he did not support that proposal, even though it was in the administration's budget, and he called it a trial balloon. The vice president said Mr. Bush's plan for privatizing part of Social Security would be a ''catastrophe.''</p>
        <p>''What he wants to do is to divert 16 percent of the money that's going into the trust fund and put it into the stock market now,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has not specified an amount that he would allow individuals to invest in the market from their Social Security payroll tax.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush refused to answer whether, under his plan, the government would protect individuals against any losses.</p>
        <p>''A safe return -- the safest of all investment vehicles -- yields about twice what the Social Security Trust is getting today,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>''Well, Governor,'' Mr. Donaldson said, ''if this were 1929, we'd probably make the same statement and then those awful years came forward and people would have lost money.'' Mr. Donaldson then reiterated his question about ''whether you think the government should make good any losses for retirees.''</p>
        <p>''There's going to be a lot of discussions about the particulars of the plan,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he agreed with the details of one of the proposals on Capitol Hill to overhaul Medicare, Mr. Bush said, ''I believe the next president must put Republicans and Democrats in a room and say, 'Let's reform Medicare.' ''</p>
        <p>When asked if the Republican Congress should accept a deal with President Clinton to cut the marriage penalty in exchange for funding Medicare to cover prescription drugs, Mr. Bush said: ''That's up to this current Congress and this current president. What the people need to know about me is that this is where I'm going to lead the Congress when I become the president.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Russert highlighted some of the changes that Mr. Gore has made on various issues over the years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who favors abortion rights, was asked if he believed that life began at conception. ''No,'' he said. Asked when life did begin, Mr. Gore said, ''There is a developmental process during which the burden kind of shifts over time,'' citing the first trimester of a pregnancy as being different from the third, but not pinpointing a time when he thought life began.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russert pointed out that, in 1987, Mr. Gore had opposed federal funding for abortions for poor women and had called abortion ''arguably the taking of a human life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore acknowledged that he had changed his position, saying he did so about 15 years ago. ''I talked to a lot of women who taught me about the kinds of circumstances that can come up and the kinds of dilemmas that women can face,'' he said. ''I've come to the very deep conviction that a woman's right to choose must be protected regardless of the woman's income.''</p>
        <p>Of a vote that he had cast that would define the term ''person'' to include the unborn, Mr. Gore said, ''That was a very odd procedural vote.''</p>
        <p>He hinted that he would not require parental permission for a minor to have an abortion. He said such requirements had tended to be used as a back-door way to try to eliminate abortion.</p>
        <p>On the death penalty, Mr. Gore said he did not support a national moratorium on executions for the 21 federal prisoners who are on death row. But he said he did support the moratorium on the death penalty in Illinois ''based on the extraordinary number of errors'' found in those cases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore had been quoted as saying that with the death penalty, ''there are always going to be some small numbers of errors.'' Today Mr. Gore said he wanted zero errors but sometimes because of human imperfection, even jury verdicts ''sometimes produce a mistake.'' But he said he was unaware of any involving the trials of the 21 federal death-row inmates.</p>
        <p>He also hinted that any state with questionable executions would do well to consider a moratorium. He did not mention Texas, however, a state that has the highest number of executions. Because of Mr. Gore's position on the death penalty, he has refrained from criticizing Mr. Bush's record on executions. Since Mr. Bush took office in 1995, Texas has executed 137 people, more than twice as many as the next highest state, Virginia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said that he was certain that every execution in Texas had been warranted, that the inmates had been guilty and had had full access to the appeals process. Today, Cokie Roberts directed him to the case of Odell Barnes, who was executed in March even though several questions had been raised about his case. He was convicted of raping and murdering Helen Bass, a 42-year-old nurse who was his mother's best friend. Mr. Barnes went to his death insisting that he had had a sexual relationship with Ms. Bass but that he had not killed her.</p>
        <p>''Well, I don't remember the specifics of Odell Barnes,'' Mr. Bush said. ''You know, and I'm not castigating it. I wish you would have given me a chance to bring the full dossier so that I could have discussed it in detail with you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush concluded: ''If you ask me whether or not I think we've ever executed an innocent person, my answer to you is no, I don't believe so. And I've reviewed every single case. And I spend a lot of time on them, as do a lot of courts and lawyers and a board of pardons and paroles.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was asked about a recent Supreme Court decision that said the Boy Scouts could exclude gay members. Mr. Gore said he had not read the opinion and offered none of his own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russert posed a series of questions on the investigations into Mr. Gore's financial activities in the 1996 campaign. Mr. Gore said Mr. Russert was ''beating a dead horse.'' Asked if his visit to a Buddhist temple in 1996 was a fund-raising event, Mr. Gore said, ''I believe it was not,'' adding, ''There was no request for funds, no money changed hands.''</p>
