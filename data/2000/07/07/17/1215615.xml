        <p>When Michael Paterniti happened to mention the urban myth about Albert Einstein's A.W.O.L. brain to his landlord, he was in for a surprise that would prove useful. Not only had the landlord also heard stories that Einstein's brain had disappeared after his death, but the landlord also had a lead on its whereabouts.

For nearly half a century Dr. Harvey had hung onto this grisly souvenir.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Paterniti, sensing the makings of the magazine article (for Harper's) that he has now inflated into book form, made a pilgrimage to Dr. Harvey in Princeton. And when Dr. Harvey expressed a desire to go to Berkeley, Calif., Mr. Paterniti offered to take him there.

        <p>DRIVING MR. ALBERT  A Trip Across America  With Einstein's Brain  By Michael Paterniti  210 pages. The Dial Press. $18.95.</p>
        <p>When Michael Paterniti happened to mention the urban myth about Albert Einstein's A.W.O.L. brain to his landlord, he was in for a surprise that would prove useful. Not only had the landlord also heard stories that Einstein's brain had disappeared after his death, but the landlord also had a lead on its whereabouts. He helped point the author toward Dr. Thomas Harvey, the pathologist who absconded with the brain after he performed a 1955 autopsy on Einstein in Princeton, N.J. For nearly half a century Dr. Harvey had hung onto this grisly souvenir.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Paterniti, sensing the makings of the magazine article (for Harper's) that he has now inflated into book form, made a pilgrimage to Dr. Harvey in Princeton. And when Dr. Harvey expressed a desire to go to Berkeley, Calif., Mr. Paterniti offered to take him there. Along came a high-concept, cutely titled account of a cross-country road trip involving an eccentric octogenarian scientist, a pensive young acolyte and a celebrity body part in a Tupperware container.</p>
        <p>Assuming that ''simply having Einstein's brain in the trunk rearranges the way you see everything,'' Mr. Paterniti took to the road. And he began the trip with a handy predilection for finding whiffs of Einsteinian thinking everywhere.</p>
        <p>''One of the themes of my earlier life, as I recall it now, is that I was forever projecting myself forward and backward at the same time, negating the present moment, changing my mind with alarming frequency,'' he reports in suitably scientific mode. Thus equipped, he could find that in a Kansas City vista ''shots of light glance off the glass windows of skyscrapers, electrons and quanta firing past us like an invisible hail of bullets.'' Or muse that ''Pennsylvania is its own kind of in-between, not rally east and not west, the pulse between neurons.''</p>
        <p>Because ''Driving Mr. Albert'' in fact revolved around a brief, largely uneventful car trip involving a not very chatty passenger (''Way-ell, it sure has been a wonderful specimen'' is Dr. Harvey at his most communicative), Mr. Paterniti often found himself reaching for something more. And so he had ample time to recall Einstein's life and its implications, or to wonder about his girlfriend home in Maine. Had she hit a moose on the road? Had she run off with the Federal Express man?</p>
        <p>Naturally there was ample time to contemplate the brain itself, cut into 240-odd fragments, and to endow it with suitably cosmic implications. After wondering whether it feels like tofu, sea urchin or bologna, Mr. Paterniti reflects, ''I mean, it's not really Einstein and it's not really a brain, but disconnected pieces of a brain, just as the passing farms are not really America but parts of a whole, symbols of the thing itself, which is everything and nothing at once.'' Everything-and-nothingness serves as the book's dominant motif.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Paterniti is ever alert to parallels between Einstein's life and anyone else's. (Einstein and Dr. Harvey each had multiple marriages; Einstein and a Japanese scientist, whom the author also visited on a separate jaunt described here, both failed important exams as students, and both had difficulties with postcollege employment.) And he likes to imagine what Einstein's thoughts might have been.</p>
        <p>A train goes by in Arizona, prompting the author to write, ''Were this 1931, Einstein might very well have been on that train,'' and adding, ''Undoubtedly, he would occasionally have looked up from his equations to see America beyond the window.'' At another juncture he decides that Einstein would have been horrified by MTV and Microsoft but amused by tae-bo, Jesse Ventura and penis augmentations.</p>
        <p>Eager for newsworthy encounters Mr. Paterniti brings Dr. Harvey to visit William Burroughs, who was the doctor's neighbor in Lawrence, Kan., even though the two elderly men had met only once before. And always alert to the possibility of larger meaning, Mr. Paterniti thinks he glimpses evidence of Mr. Burroughs's most notorious exploits in the famous old author's wrinkles. For his part, Mr. Burroughs, the legendary wild man, downs five Coke-and-vodkas on top of his daily methadone, smokes a joint and then begins addressing Dr. Harvey as Dr. Senegal. This is easily one of the more newsworthy encounters along the book's otherwise pedestrian journey.</p>
        <p>Matters grow desperate. Mr. Paterniti is prompted by the offer of more coffee from a waitress in Lawrence to reflect that she might have been blown up in the 20-year-old television movie ''The Day After.'' He and Dr. Harvey call Evelyn Einstein, the scientist's granddaughter, and ask to visit her in Berkeley, to which she replies: ''I don't know. My house is a mess.''</p>
        <p>They stop at carefully chosen places of Einsteinian import, like Los Alamos, N.M., without prompting more than a ''Way-ell'' or two out of Dr. Harvey. The author dodges a truck bearing the name ''Marianne,'' which is the name of his mother. And he does his laundry, a process described with typically indiscriminate fervor. ''It feels powerful to drop the dirty stuff of a long week into a tub of sudsy water,'' he relates, ''and have my pants and shirts come out clean.''</p>
        <p>In the latter stages of the journey, Mr. Paterniti takes to buttonholing strangers for journalistic effect. ''I'm on a trip,'' he says to two tourists in Las Vegas, ''and I was wondering what you two know about Albert Einstein?'' A blackjack dealer says, ''I don't know anything about him, but that man over there should be able to help you.'' The casino manager, asked about Einstein, curtly answers: ''Haven't seen him in here tonight. Sorry, pal.''</p>
        <p>In his search for the real meaning of his experience, which ultimately includes sleeping with the brain on a pillow in his bed ''just to see,'' Mr. Paterniti grasps ambitiously and self-importantly at every available straw. But the best assessment of his studiously cerebral journey comes from Independence High School in San Jose, Calif., where Dr. Harvey stops to display his treasure to students ''repulsed and captivated by the man whose fingers are wet with brain.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Harvey, ''heady on the perfume of social studies teachers,'' meets one woman who sees what Mr. Paterniti works overtime to aggrandize. ''I'm meeting a footnote here,'' she tells him, and she's right.</p>
