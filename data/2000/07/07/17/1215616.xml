        <p>IT is not every day that the trailblazer of a multibillion-dollar niche of the satellite industry is an entrepreneur betting on the commercial potential of Africa. No wonder Noah Samara is smiling at the irony.</p>
        <p>''The fundamental difference between one person and another, rich or poor, is access to information,'' said Mr. Samara, who was born in Ethiopia, raised in Tanzania and educated at the University of California at Berkeley. ''It is kind of funny that our basic approach of profiting from providing that access is ahead of what is happening in the developed world.''</p>
        <p>Late last year, Mr. Samara's company, the WorldSpace Corporation, based in Washington, initiated satellite radio-broadcasting service in a region stretching from Cairo to Cape Town, providing Africa with 25 audio channels of news, music, entertainment and educational programming.</p>
        <p>WorldSpace's foray into Africa was a milestone for the budding satellite radio industry. In various regions, including North America, the idea is that an array of high-quality radio channels will prove more attractive to many listeners than their local radio stations -- like the way that cable television and satellite television changed broadcast television.</p>
        <p>WorldSpace's digital audio broadcast system, which depends on a solar-powered satellite beamed into space from a launch site in French Guiana, is a harbinger of things to come. So far, the company has showed promise in urban areas with large expatriate communities wanting regional news, such as Indian merchants in Kenya or Nigerians living in other African countries.</p>
        <p>But it will be far from Africa, on the dashboards of automobiles in the United States, where the development of the industry is expected to be played out with fervor.</p>
        <p>In four years, satellite radio is expected to grow from virtually nothing into a $2.4 billion global industry, according to C.E. Unterberg Towbin, a brokerage firm that focuses on the satellite industry. In this country, the two companies seen fueling the growth are Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, which have received the only two licenses from the Federal Communications Commission to offer satellite radio.</p>
        <p>By this time next year, both companies hope to be able to deliver 100 audio channels throughout the United States, for a monthly charge of about $10. The service is to be available to either fixed or mobile locations. Test versions of the receiving antenna are small domes only a few inches in diameter that could be attached externally to the rear windows of automobiles. Each of the channels will be devoted to a specific theme, like jazz or classical or salsa music, with much of the programming produced at Sirius's studio in New York and XM's in Washington.</p>
        <p>Sirius went public in 1994; its shares closed at $49.25 on Friday, more than double last fall's price. XM went public in October and announced last week that it had completed a final round of financing with the private placement of $235 million in convertible stock, raising its total funds to $1.26 billion. Its publicly traded shares, which spent last fall in the low teens, closed Friday at $40.875.</p>
        <p>Investors in the companies, which include major car manufacturers and satellite companies, are wagering that consumers in the United States will be eager to pay for CD-quality radio in their automobiles -- on the assumption that radio is as essential to the car as television is to the home.</p>
        <p>''Our business model foresees us becoming profitable if we capture just 1 percent of the market,'' said David Margolese, the president of Sirius. ''It's premised on the idea that a lot of people in a prosperous, large country like this one will be willing to spend a little extra to get top-quality radio programming when they're in traffic.''</p>
        <p>So far, Sirius has distribution agreements with Ford Motor, DaimlerChrysler and BMW, while XM has an agreement with General Motors and is in talks to form a similar agreement with the Honda Motor Company. When Sirius successfully launched the first of three satellites it plans to send into space, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome site in Kazakhstan earlier this month, its shares rose 10 percent in one day.</p>
        <p>''This is a chance to buy into something that could profoundly change the way Americans consume their music,'' said Peter J. Eichler, the president of Aletheia Research and Management, a $150 million money management firm in Santa Monica, Calif. ''It's easy; you just have to choose between two companies because the industry is controlled by a duopoly.''</p>
        <p>Still, there are obstacles to overcome before service is rolled out by next year. Sirius needs to launch two more satellites, while XM Satellite Radio also needs to launch both of its two planned satellites, which it intends to do from a mobile launching site in the Pacific Ocean -- the first later this year. Analysts say there is about a 10 percent chance of a failure for each of the companies' launches, and such a failure could mean delays in the initiation of consumer service.</p>
        <p>There is also concern over the quality of reception, even though both companies say that tests indicate listeners will have virtually static-free coast-to-coast reception.</p>
        <p>''The quality should be fine, but this might depend on the construction of some line-of-sight apparatus on the ground to ensure seamless transmission, and that deployment could get expensive,'' said William Kidd, who covers the satellite radio industry for Unterberg.</p>
        <p>Regardless of what happens, analysts don't expect either company to show a profit before 2004. In the time being, some people are pondering the effect satellite radio will have on the conventional radio broadcasting industry, which has not been shaken by a major technical innovation since the introduction of the FM band. (Of course, there is Internet radio broadcasting. But that requires a computer and Internet access, and it may be years before wireless versions are viable.)</p>
        <p>Since the rules regarding ownership of multiple radio stations were loosened under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the broadcast industry has been through extensive consolidation, with large media companies like Clear Channel Communications and Viacom acquiring small radio stations throughout the country.</p>
        <p>Two large satellite radio companies could further concentrate power in the radio industry, critics say. ''Radio will become more of a wasteland because satellite radio won't offer much space for localism,'' said Robert McChesney, a mass media professor at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. ''Remember the mom-and-pop radio stations? They will all be gone.''</p>
        <p>With their large production studios, though, satellite radio companies say that they could produce content unparalleled by small radio stations. ''We can surpass radio's golden age,'' said Hugh Panero, the president of XM. ''We'll be able to tailor content in ways people wouldn't dream of.''</p>
        <p>Of course, these are rich-country problems. WorldSpace, which is backed by investors from Saudi Arabia and from several African countries, plans to expand into Asia, and then into South America, with two additional satellites.</p>
        <p>With a substantially different business model from those of Sirius and XM, WorldSpace will concentrate on providing satellite radio service to people who are stationary, and perhaps not yet prosperous enough to buy a car. The company hopes to make money from advertising aimed at regions with a combined population of more than four billion people.</p>
        <p>''Nothing,'' Mr. Samara said, ''can cross the geographic and cultural divides like radio can.''</p>
