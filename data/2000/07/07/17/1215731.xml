        <p>The ultimate blend of pedigree, training and riding skill combined to produce a solid favorite and solid winner on the grass at Belmont Park yesterday when the 3-year-old colt Rob's Spirit won the $150,000 Lexington by 5 1-2 lengths.</p>
        <p>Rob's Spirit comes from the stable that brought Cigar to racing glory: Allen E. Paulson, the owner, and Bill Mott, the trainer, with Jerry Bailey riding for the fifth straight time. And the colt, a 3-year-old son of Theatrical and grandson of Nureyev and Alydar, scored his third victory in five starts when Bailey nudged him past Plato, who finished second, and Rumsonontheriver, who finished third after leading all the way.</p>

        <p>The ultimate blend of pedigree, training and riding skill combined to produce a solid favorite and solid winner on the grass at Belmont Park yesterday when the 3-year-old colt Rob's Spirit won the $150,000 Lexington by 5 1-2 lengths.</p>
        <p>Rob's Spirit comes from the stable that brought Cigar to racing glory: Allen E. Paulson, the owner, and Bill Mott, the trainer, with Jerry Bailey riding for the fifth straight time. And the colt, a 3-year-old son of Theatrical and grandson of Nureyev and Alydar, scored his third victory in five starts when Bailey nudged him past Plato, who finished second, and Rumsonontheriver, who finished third after leading all the way.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't have asked for a better trip,'' Bailey said in the winner's circle. ''He's got a great cruising speed, and he lets you sit him where you need him. The turf didn't seem that soft to me, but he handled the going great, anyway. He'll only get better.''</p>
        <p>Rob's Spirit ran the mile and a quarter on the inner turf course in 2:02 4/5, returned $3.70 for a $2 bet and added $90,000 to his career earnings. The second favorite, Parade Leader, with Pat Day riding, came up empty in the stretch and finished fifth.</p>
