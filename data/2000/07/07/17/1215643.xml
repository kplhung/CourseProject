        <p>Utilities Seek New Ways To Change Use of Power  With millions of air conditioners humming and dire warnings of electricity running short at hours of peak demand, a growing number of utilities say there is plenty of power around if only they can allocate it properly.</p>
        <p>Utilities are using some decidedly novel tactics to do so, particularly new methods of pricing energy and new ways for managing energy demand, like installing radio-controlled switches on central air conditioners, to turn them off at peak hours, and paying companies not to use electricity.

        <p>Utilities Seek New Ways To Change Use of Power  With millions of air conditioners humming and dire warnings of electricity running short at hours of peak demand, a growing number of utilities say there is plenty of power around if only they can allocate it properly.</p>
        <p>Utilities are using some decidedly novel tactics to do so, particularly new methods of pricing energy and new ways for managing energy demand, like installing radio-controlled switches on central air conditioners, to turn them off at peak hours, and paying companies not to use electricity.

        <p>General Mills in Deal for Pillsbury  In the latest merger between food companies seeking strength from scale, General Mills will pay $10.5 billion for Diageo's Pillsbury unit. Under the deal, to be announced today, Diageo will receive $5.1 billion in cash and $5.4 billion in General Mills shares. [National Report.]</p>
        <p>Mind Behind the Sport Utility Buyer  Research by automakers is finding that buyers of sport utility vehicles and minivans are different psychologically. Sport utility buyers tend to be more ''self-oriented'' while minivan buyers tend to be more ''other-oriented.'' The carmakers find the research persuasive enough that it is affecting the way vehicles are designed and advertised. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Cooperating to Attract Customers  Before Internet retailers were expected to make a profit, they could easily spend $100 or more chasing down a customer. Those days are over, but a technique known as reciprocal marketing, which allows companies to offer their paying customers discounts at other online retailers, allows merchants to attract customers at little expense. For example, consumers who spend $40 at eToys get a gift certificate for $10 at Gap.com. Those that spend $40 at Gap.com get a $10 certificate at ProFlowers.com. And so on.

        <p>Qwest Joins Deutsche Telekom List  Deutsche Telekom has made informal overtures about reinitiating merger talks with Qwest Communications, executives close to the companies said. [National Report.]</p>
        <p>Global Crossing Deal Falls Apart  A deal between Global Crossing and Exodus Communications collapsed over the weekend as the two companies failed to agree on a price, people close to the companies said. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Icann Votes to Add Domain Names  Regulators who manage addresses on the Internet voted to increase the number of suffixes at the end of every e-mail address and Web page by an unspecified number. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Ebony Shuts Down in South Africa  The South African edition of Ebony magazine, introduced nearly five years ago in the afterglow of the country's triumph over apartheid, has shut down after failing to find profits or many readers. Prosperity has been slower than expected in reaching the black majority. For Ebony South Africa, that meant a retail market with too little interest in advertising to black consumers and a magazine industry with little room for a publication celebrating a level of success that few blacks in the country have achieved.

        <p>Alteon to Introduce Net System  Alteon Websystems is expected to introduce a system today that is designed to help companies increase the efficiency and speed of their online transactions. [C6.]</p>
