        <p>Vice President Al Gore plans to ply the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes in a boat after the Democratic convention in Los Angeles next month, campaign officials said today.</p>
        <p>The water route will take Mr. Gore on a political showboat through the industrial Midwest and some of the most contested states in the November election. It is not clear where the boat tour will begin, but Mr. Gore and his floating entourage are expected to make stops in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and Missouri.</p>
        <p>The idea is to try to take advantage of the momentum that presidential candidates traditionally gain after their conventions. The formula was a huge success for Bill Clinton and Mr. Gore after the 1992 convention, when they rode a bus with their wives across small-town America -- and secondary media markets -- where presidential candidates seldom visit in the heat of a campaign.</p>
        <p>This year's Democratic convention runs from Aug. 14 through 17, putting the boat trip in one of the slowest news cycles of the year. That means Mr. Gore will probably not face much competition from other news events for attention, but it also means many voters will be on vacation and tuned out of the campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers said they expected the trip to yield upbeat pictures of a relaxed candidate talking with real people in the heartland. Such events can generate enormous and generally positive local media coverage.</p>
        <p>His aides said it was unclear whether Mr. Gore's vice-presidential nominee would accompany him on the trip. If that person has a connection to any of those Midwest battleground states, a joint appearance would be likely.</p>
        <p>The Gore camp is looking to the next several weeks as its chance to try to catch Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the polls. There is talk, officials said, of Mr. Gore's announcing his vice-presidential selection in early August to cut into the momentum that Mr. Bush is expected to receive from the Philadelphia convention, which begins on July 31.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore will try to build on the stir after the announcement with a preconvention swing that takes him into Los Angeles, but the details have not been worked out.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign has been looking to this period as a time for Mr. Gore to seize the attention, energize his supporters and establish himself as his own person. Because Mr. Gore has had difficulty establishing his own identity apart from President Clinton, the Gore team has scheduled the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton to speak on the convention's opening night. It intends to devote the remaining days to Mr. Gore.</p>
