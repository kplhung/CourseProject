        <p>Best-selling author, inspirational speaker, endorser of products ranging from cereal to sunglasses, foundation official, family man and wearer of the Tour de France's yellow jersey as its leader, the conglomerate Lance Armstrong confirmed that life is good.</p>
        <p>''Perfect,'' the Tour's defending champion said. ''I don't know what perfect is, but this is perfect enough for me.''</p>
        <p>Just plain living is good, he said, referring to his recovery from cancer and the effects of chemotherapy in 1996. Beyond that, his way of life is good -- his wife, Kristin, his 10-month-old son, Luke, his job -- and he is happy.</p>
        <p>How does it feel to be the proverbial man who has everything? ''I think a big part of my success is the lifestyle, the comfort that I have now, the happiness that I have now,'' he said. ''Not that I was unhappy before, but this is certainly the happiest I've ever been in life, period. I don't know if I have everything, but I have everything I need. I don't know what everything is, but I have enough.</p>
        <p>''The money thing is relative. I have enough to not have to do this, but I love this, this makes me happy. The bike, the training, the sport, the atmosphere. Even the travel, the training camps, everything that goes with it.''</p>
        <p>He paused in his litany of euphoria. ''Not this hotel,'' the Austin, Tex., native added. Lounging on his bed after a 45-minute massage, Armstrong gestured around the tacky room with water stains showing through the plush on the walls.</p>
        <p>Especially when he is feeling feisty, the 28-year-old leader of the United States Postal Service team is noted for complaining about the sometimes dreadful hotels that race organizers assign. There is no doubting his feistiness now.</p>
        <p>''We still have a lot of racing to go,'' he said cautiously before the start of three stages in the Alps. ''I'm surprised at my fitness. I focused totally on this event and wanted this result, but I didn't expect to be entering the Alps with a five-minute lead. That really surprises me. Five minutes is a lot.''</p>
        <p>He brushed aside his three second-place finishes so far in the 87th Tour. ''It's not important to win stages,'' he said. ''What's important is to win in Paris,'' where the three-week race ends next Sunday. The best comparison of a bicycle tour race is to a golf tournament. In golf, victory on individual holes usually does not matter compared to the overall stroke total. In the Tour, stage victories do not determine the winner; the least overall elapsed time does.</p>
        <p>Propping a pillow more comfortably behind his head, Armstrong was equally uninterested in judging whether he is the best climber in the race. He ascribes his power in the mountains to his loss of weight -- he weighed 180 pounds in 1996, when he dropped out of the Tour a few months before his testicular cancer was diagnosed, compared with 160 pounds now -- and his use of a smaller gear and increased pedal strokes as he moves uphill.</p>
        <p>''I don't care to be called a climber,'' he said. ''I don't care to be called a time trialist,'' another discipline in which he excels. ''It's important to be a complete rider.</p>
        <p>''If I'm the second-best climber and the second-best time trialist and that wins the Tour de France, perfect. Perfect.'' He turned to a saying from golf, a hobby he likes to think he shows talent in: ''Short game -- drive for show, putt for dough.''</p>
        <p>Armstrong said that his motivation to repeat as Tour champion was his continuing inspiration to other cancer survivors.</p>
        <p>''That is not as big a story as it was last year, but it's still my main purpose,'' he said. ''It's still a big part of my motivation. This race is about surviving and survival. To do it, at least to participate, to try to win again, hopefully win again, is survival.</p>
        <p>''Cancer people survive now. People live the rest of their lives normally.''</p>
        <p>There is another side to his motivation, and that is Armstrong's quiet rage against those he thinks showed him no respect after his victory last year. These include the people in the news media who suggested that he used illegal drugs and the rivals who he said implied that he would not have won if they had been in the race.</p>
        <p>''It gives me drive,'' he said of the criticism. ''Absolutely. Absolutely. You've got to get motivated by something.''</p>
        <p>What about the positive influences?</p>
        <p>''It's a package,'' he said. ''There's the good energy, family stuff, my place in the cancer world, all the right reasons. Then there are the other things that just make me mad. Like somebody having no respect for me in the race. That I use as well. You need both.''</p>
        <p>Time for the team dinner neared and the Texan rose from his bed and edged around his open suitcase that sat on a table. ''Not much room to move in this room,'' he said, straightening the clothing in the suitcase, including his latest yellow jersey.</p>
        <p>Despite his grumbling, Armstrong said he tried to be a good person.</p>
        <p>''We have an obligation to be good people,'' he said. ''I can be mean, I can yell and scream and cuss and be seemingly a bad person. But at the end of the day, I'm going to do whatever it takes -- if I was checking out that night -- to prove that I was a good guy.</p>
        <p>''Whether it was giving back to the world of cancer, giving back to the world in general, giving back to my family, giving back to the sport -- whether it's financially or your time, whether it's that yellow jersey in the suitcase, if it's just giving it away, that's what you've got to do.''</p>
