        <p>The Aetna Corporation, which has been in talks to sell its financial and international units to ING Groep, the Dutch financial services company, has yet to resolve key issues in the deal, people close to the talks said yesterday.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Aetna's board tentatively endorsed the transaction, which is likely to exceed $7 billion, including debt, according to several people close to the companies. But Aetna and ING executives still have to resolve issues related to Aetna's domestic business, particularly how Aetna can avoid paying a huge tax bill as a result of the sale to ING.</p>
        <p>Both companies had originally planned to announce today that a deal had been struck. But if they can come to terms in the coming days, the people said, the sale could be announced by the middle of the week.</p>
        <p>Aetna executives initially thought they could get a better price by auctioning off the businesses in pieces instead of selling them as a whole. But it found few takers and was worried about a huge tax bite.</p>
        <p>Aetna began talks with ING several months ago, but those discussions stalled over price. The financial services unit includes the annuity and asset management business, while the international unit is made up of businesses that include life insurance and health care, among others.</p>
        <p>Representatives of both Aetna and ING would not comment on the discussions.</p>
        <p>Jim Lane, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said that for Aetna shareholders pondering the talks between Aetna and ING, the central question was not the ''minutiae'' of credit ratings and tax planning, but the underlying value of Aetna's health care unit. If the sale goes forward, he said, current Aetna shareholders would most likely be left with shares in a new company that is made up of Aetna U.S. Healthcare and some cash.</p>
        <p>''That's the math that people should be thinking about, and there's no visibility on it,'' Mr. Lane said. ''The management team has not been willing to comment on the outlook for earnings in the U.S. Healthcare segment. They haven't given a definitive earnings outlook for two and almost three quarters.''</p>
        <p>One scenario that has been described is Aetna spinning off its health care unit to shareholders before it completes the sale with ING. If Aetna and ING did that, Mr. Lane said, it would be a much more shareholder-friendly deal because the tax bill would be lower.</p>
        <p>Aetna has been under pressure from shareholders to sell assets and improve its health care operations, thus lifting its stock price. The company has sold seven of its international units and ventures over the last 10 months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane said that Aetna's operations were so diverse that it was hard to find synergies among them.</p>
