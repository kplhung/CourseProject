        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''How Race Is Lived in America'':</p>
        <p>The Jewish Council for Public Affairs, a network of national and local Jewish public affairs organizations, has just completed a two-year study of race and public policy based on the views of scholars, public officials and community activists who offered a range of ideological and political viewpoints.</p>
        <p>These are among its findings: Jews largely support affirmative action that considers race among many factors. Also needed are effective antipoverty programs, true justice in the courts and quality public education. At the local level, members of the Jewish community are taking part in interracial socialaction coalitions engaged in projects that foster literacy, youth mentoring, low-  and moderate-income housing, and economic development. What we learn from Judaism and Jewish history impels us to work to build a just society. Our vision is of a country that is inclusive and open, ensuring equal rights and opportunity for all.</p>
        <p>LEONARD A. COLE  Chairman, Jewish Council  for Public Affairs  New York, July 7, 2000</p>
