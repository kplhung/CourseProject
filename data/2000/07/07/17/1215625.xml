        <p>In January, Simon &amp; Schuster published ''Gone: The Last Days of The New Yorker,'' by Renata Adler, a former New Yorker critic. In the book, Ms. Adler wrote that Judge John J. Sirica, who supervised the Watergate trial and who died in 1992, had ties to organized crime.</p>
        <p>''I had found that, contrary to what he wrote, and contrary to his reputation as a hero, Sirica was in fact a corrupt, incompetent, and dishonest figure, with a close connection to Senator Joseph McCarthy and clear ties to organized crime,'' Ms. Adler wrote on page 125, in explaining why she declined to review the judge's autobiography, published in 1979.</p>

        <p>In January, Simon &amp; Schuster published ''Gone: The Last Days of The New Yorker,'' by Renata Adler, a former New Yorker critic. In the book, Ms. Adler wrote that Judge John J. Sirica, who supervised the Watergate trial and who died in 1992, had ties to organized crime.</p>
        <p>''I had found that, contrary to what he wrote, and contrary to his reputation as a hero, Sirica was in fact a corrupt, incompetent, and dishonest figure, with a close connection to Senator Joseph McCarthy and clear ties to organized crime,'' Ms. Adler wrote on page 125, in explaining why she declined to review the judge's autobiography, published in 1979.</p>
        <p>John J. Sirica Jr., the judge's son, requested that Simon &amp; Schuster retract the organized crime charge. Simon &amp; Schuster declined. A media column and an editorial in The New York Times raised questions about why Ms. Adler did not provide evidence supporting the accusation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Adler said she would present proof at a time of her choosing. In the August issue of Harper's magazine, which arrives on newsstands on July 24, Ms. Adler presents her argument in a 12-page article that is critical of The Times's coverage of the accusation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Adler points to the judge's career as a professional boxer and promoter of boxing events in the 1920's, before he became a lawyer. Ms. Adler asserts that professional boxing in this country ''was at the time, and had been since at least 1903, controlled by organized crime.'' At the time, boxing was illegal in the District of Columbia, where Judge Sirica was doing some of his boxing. Because illegal boxing at the time required a large criminal network, Ms. Adler writes, Judge Sirica therefore knowingly had ties to organized crime.</p>
        <p>Ms. Adler also cites the ownership by Judge Sirica's father of a barbershop at which the barbers sold liquor to clients during Prohibition and suggests that Judge Sirica, who was then serving in the United States Attorney's office, must have known of his father's criminal dealings. Without citing a direct source, she writes that the police in the barber shop's precinct were ''paid off -- and there was whatever protection was implied'' by Judge Sirica's service in the United States Attorney's office at the time. She also raises questions about why the judge, while still a law student, formed what she described as implausibly close friendships with powerful Washington figures like the real estate mogul Morris Cafritz and Milton Kronheim, a liquor distributor.</p>
        <p>Last week, the younger Mr. Sirica said that Ms. Adler had not presented adequate proof.</p>
        <p>''I take the issue of saying that he had ties to organized crime very seriously,'' he said. ''To me, that means someone is either a member of the Mafia or is benefiting financially from their endeavors. To me, this is a lot of innuendo strung together in an effort to salvage her reputation.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Adler declined to comment. Lewis H. Lapham, the editor in chief of Harper's, issued a one-line statement: ''It is a fine essay and a fine piece of reporting.''</p>
