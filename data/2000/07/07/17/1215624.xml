        <p>As a maker of dances, Mark Morris is unpredictable. Sometimes his choreography is wonderfully inventive. At other times it is merely facile. It was both on Thursday night when the Mark Morris Dance Group performed in Page Auditorium as an attraction of the American Dance Festival on the campus of Duke University here.</p>
        <p>One thing about Mr. Morris remains predictable. He loves to have his dances accompanied by live music. On this occasion a chamber ensemble of instrumentalists and singers was in the pit under the direction of Ethan Iverson. They did much to make the program theatrically exciting.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately ''Sang-Froid,'' Mr. Morris's premiere, did not show him at his choreographic best. The production was commissioned by the festival through the Doris Duke Awards for New Work. Much of the choreography to Chopin piano music played by Mr. Iverson fit the title by being determinedly controlled. Although it initially attracted attention because of its unruffled composure, it ultimately proved as drab as the simple black costumes Elizabeth Kurtzman designed for the dancers.</p>
        <p>Feet pattered. Dancers slapped the floor with their hands, collapsed and straightened up again. In one effective sequence, to the so-called ''Minute Waltz,'' some dancers kept trying to hurry past other dancers who stood in their way like turnstiles or roadblocks.</p>
        <p>There was a deliberate lack of energy to much of the proceedings. One episode was to a mazurka that Michel Fokine early in the 20th century used in ''Les Sylphides,'' his great ballet to Chopin. Fokine created exultant leaps to this music. Mr. Morris also devised leaps. But these were low ones.</p>
        <p>Whereas Chopin's music was always emotionally juicy, Mr. Morris's choreography stayed dry. One wondered what his reasons were for showing so much sang-froid at such great length.</p>
        <p>It was also hard to care much about ''The Argument,'' even though this work to Schumann depicted quarreling couples. These squabblers moved brusquely and stamped their feet a lot, yet with a surprising lack of commitment. At this performance ''The Argument'' lost its sting.</p>
        <p>Both ''The Argument'' and ''Sang-froid'' were offered before the intermission. After the intermission the choreography and the dancing steadily improved.</p>
        <p>''Bedtime'' was accompanied by Schubert songs about the night. At first night seemed a quiet time. Dancers moved gently, as if to solace other people who were curled up like sleepers on the floor. Dancers also darted lightly, as if symbolizing pleasant dreams. Then dreams turned into nightmares, as dancers rushed wildly to ''The Erl-king,'' a song about a little boy abducted by an evil spirit. Some passages of hopping, which possibly were intended to be grotesque, looked comic instead. But the choreography as a whole was appropriately feverish.</p>
        <p>Bouncy piano pieces by Richard Cumming, played by Mr. Iverson, inspired Mr. Morris to create bouncy choreography for Joe Bowie and Matthew Rose in ''Silhouettes.'' This was a duet. Yet it was one in which the two dancers never touched. Nevertheless they always appeared to sense each other's presence. They stayed emotionally together even when the dance steps drew them apart.</p>
        <p>The evening came to a warmhearted conclusion with ''Dancing Honeymoon,'' a work of 1998 that is one of Mr. Morris's most felicitous creations in recent years. People cavorted in a breezy nonchalant manner to a suite of old pop songs sung by Eileen Clark. The dancers also kept shifting, standing on and climbing over a set of folding chairs. Eventually they tossed the chairs back and forth through the air in an eccentric game of catch. ''Dancing Honeymoon'' was a buoyant choreographic excursion.</p>
