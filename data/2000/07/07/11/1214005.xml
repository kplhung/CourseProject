        <p>Engaged in daily combat on many fronts are swarms of invader species that number in the millions throughout the Great Lakes -- among them the Eurasian ruffe, the round goby, the zebra mussel and the sea lamprey -- and hundreds of single-minded biologists and wildlife managers who are trying to destroy them.</p>
        <p>Well behind the battle fronts are commanders, often with conflicting agendas, from dozens of local, regional and federal agencies, American and Canadian, and their constituents -- big shippers and industries, sport and commercial fisherman, environmentalists and the general public.</p>
        <p>At stake is the ecological future of the Great Lakes, collectively the world's largest body of fresh water.  Under the impact of wave after wave of alien invasions, most brought in the ballast tanks of freighters arriving from across the Atlantic, the lakes are ''really in turmoil,'' said David J. Jude, a research scientist at the University of Michigan. The alien incursions are killing off native species and, in some areas, changing the very face of the lakes.</p>
        <p>''Probably 90 percent of the animals present in Lake Erie were not there 15 years ago,'' said Dr. Hugh MacIsaac, a professor of ecology at the University of Windsor, Ontario, and the same could be said of most of the other Great Lakes.</p>
        <p>As of 1997, Canada and the United States had spent $30 million on research into alien species, said G. Tracy Mehan, director of the Michigan Office of the Great Lakes. And since 1970, $300 million has been spent on actual operations aimed at eradicating a single species, lampreys.</p>
        <p>But all this money has been like artillery barrages against a well-entrenched enemy that constantly brings in reinforcements. Just as scientists seem to gain control of one invader, a new alien species appears.</p>
        <p>The newest threat is the spiny water flea, Bythotrephes cederstroemi, which clogs anglers' fishing lines. reels and nets with their gooey bodies hooked together in crystalline masses. But it is only one of a long line of invaders.</p>
        <p>Scientists believe the biggest threat, sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus), first reached the western lakes as early as the 1920's by way of the Welland Canal, which connects the Erie Canal -- and beyond it the Hudson River -- with Lake Erie. Still earlier, in the 1820's, the European weed purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) arrived, infesting and corrupting wetlands.</p>
        <p>By the time many of the alien species arrived, human settlement had already severely damaged the delicately balanced ecosystems of the inland lakes, which are only 10,000 years old. People overfished, dammed up many of the lakes' 5,747 tributaries, drained wetlands and polluted the water with industrial waste and sewage.</p>
        <p>But all this was nothing compared with the damage wrought by the sudden profusion of alien species unintentionally imported by ships from overseas. By 1997 the list of so-called exotics -- ranging from bacteria to plants, fleas to fish -- numbered 139. Now it is up to 145.</p>
        <p>''This is a war, started by man,'' Dr. Jude said. ''And we're losing it.''</p>
        <p>Imported species can proliferate with remarkable speed.</p>
        <p>In April 1990, Dr. Jude discovered a strange fish during a study, financed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, at the intake tube of a Detroit Edison power plant on the St. Clair River, an important link between Lake Erie and Lake Huron. A university colleague identified it as a round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), an aggressive bottom dweller originating in the Caspian, Black and Azov Seas that can spawn up to five times a year.</p>
        <p>Within four years round gobies and their cousins, the tubenose gobies (Proterorhinus marmoratus), had spread to Lake Huron and Lake Michigan and into streams.</p>
        <p>To amuse colleagues, Dr. Jude composed an 11-verse ballad, ''The Galloping Goby Blues,'' portraying the goby as the fish that swallowed the Great Lakes. He sang a sample:</p>
        <p>Round gobies now rule among the rocks</p>
        <p>They can live out of water, they'll bite you in your socks</p>
        <p>And if we don't stop them soon, there'll only be bad news</p>
        <p>I've got those egg- suckin', fish- chewin', galloping goby blues.</p>
        <p>Although Dr. Jude still follows the goby, after a recent bid for more research money was rejected, he turned his attention to lake trout, the main predator of the lakes and the native species most endangered by sea lampreys.</p>
        <p>The proliferation of the goby and other alien species is caused mainly by bilge water discharges from the ocean-going ships that have been entering the Great Lakes through the St. Lawrence Seaway for the last 40 years.</p>
        <p>To combat the problem, the federal government adopted a law in 1993 requiring overseas shippers to exchange their ballast water in the Atlantic, before entering the Great Lakes. Canada has similar, but voluntary, guidelines.</p>
        <p>The ballast exchange, however, leaves residual alien species unscathed in the 100 to 200 tons of unpumpable sludge at the bottom of ballast tanks of the 500 or so foreign vessels that traverse the lakes annually.</p>
        <p>Industry officials oppose proposals that would require shippers to treat bilge with ultraviolet rays, heat, chemicals or biocides like glutaraldehyde. A coalition of 72 port representatives, shippers, trade unions and other interested groups has formed to fight ballast-sterilization legislation submitted in January by a Michigan state senator, Ken Sikkema.</p>
        <p>On a broader level, the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission, established by the United States and Canada in 1955, sent letters in April to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Lloyd Axworthy, Canada's minister of foreign affairs, saying that the ballast water exchange programs ''need to be revised or replaced.''</p>
        <p>About the same time, working in the combat zone -- the mouth of the Thunder Bay River, which flows through the shipping port of Alpena to Lake Huron -- Anjanette K. Hintz, a federal Fish and Wildlife Service worker, was trawling in a small boat for exotic species. She had her sights sets on another nuisance fish, the perchlike Eurasian ruffe (Gymnocephalus Cernuus).</p>
        <p>In five passes that consumed the better part of a day, Ms. Hintz dragged up only one ruffe, a year-old female that was about to spawn. But dredged up from 20 feet below -- along with submerged logs, clusters of zebra mussels, a beer can, a fat carp, a bluegill, a bullhead, some trout perch and other minnows -- were three round gobies.</p>
        <p>''We don't really know where the ruffe goes in spring,'' she explained. ''They like the Thunder Bay because it is deep and dark. We are trying to develop a small enough acoustic sensor to track them.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hintz has been tracking the exotics since she started with the service here in 1994. The first ruffe arrived the next year, and last summer she caught 400 of them with trawl nets and electroshocking.</p>
        <p>As with the gobies, the ruffe originated in the Black and Caspian Seas. They were first detected in Duluth Harbor in 1986 and have since spread through other Great Lakes. The ruffe was designated an aquatic nuisance species by the federal government in 1992.</p>
        <p>Thomas R. Busiahn, who works for the wildlife service in Ashland, Wis., called the explosively growing ruffe population ''a serious threat to North American fishery resources.'' The fish compete with native yellow perch and walleyed pike, and consume the eggs of the commercially important whitefish, among other species.</p>
        <p>Similarly, gobies feed voraciously and pose a threat to native species by competing for food, including fish eggs and zooplankton. (The only plus attributed to gobies is that they also eat zebra mussels.)</p>
        <p>Scientists have concluded that some gobies have spread by anglers who acquired them at one site for bait and then dumped the excess overboard in other waters.</p>
        <p>What to do?</p>
        <p>So far the biologists have succeeded only in intensive surveillance of the latest invaders and in spreading the word among sports fishermen and commercial bait dealers to kill them and report them.</p>
        <p>There are proposals to design nesting shelters attractive to the invaders where they and their offspring could be trapped and destroyed; to create barriers to migration; to foster likely predators like the largemouth bass; and to spread a relatively benign but costly compound proven successful in controlling sea lampreys, TFM, to destroy ruffe and gobies. There have been strong objections to some of these by environmental groups.</p>
        <p>The most promising technology for combatting invaders may lie in the realm of pheromones, the odors that the fish generate, especially in turbid waters, to attract sex partners, to warn of danger or, like canines, to mark hospitable territory.</p>
        <p>One scientist who has pioneered pheromone research in fish is Dr. Peter Sorensen of the University of Minnesota. In 1995, he and his associates succeeded in identifying the migratory pheromone of the sea lamprey, which is so efficient at following chemical traces through the water that Dr. Sorensen once described it as ''a swimming nose.''</p>
        <p>The elusive scent consisted of two bile acids exuded from the gall bladder in feces. Sea lampreys mark favored spawning streams with this substance, allowing them to locate the streams at a great distance from open waters. Three years later, in 1998, Dr. Sorensen and his team isolated the sex pheromone in the urine of male lampreys.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sorensen said he and his colleagues were also ''fairly far along'' in learning how to calibrate pheromone densities from stream to stream with what he called ''enzyme immunoassays.'' This may make it possible one day to neutralize popular spawning sites, or to attract vast numbers of males to selected ''manageable'' streams where they can be trapped and sterilized. This would provide scientists the equivalent of ''shooting fish in a barrel,'' Dr. Sorensen said.</p>
        <p>The principal measures against lampreys, short of catching and eating them (Henry I of England died in 1135 after consuming some), have included applying lampricides to larval habitats, trapping them at barriers and releasing sterilized males at spawning time in the spring.</p>
        <p>This spring, the wildlife service trapped over 2,400 lampreys at a  $240,000 barrier equipped with electrodes on the Ocqueoc River near here -- one of 19 barriers on American and Canadian streams. An estimated 56 percent of the spawning run is trapped. Sterilized with the chemical compound bisazir, males compete successfully for females but are unable to fertilize them.</p>
        <p>According to the Fishery Commission, lampreys destroy lake trout, whitefish and chub by attaching themselves to their bodies, rasping holes and sucking the life out of them. Fishermen once harvested 15 million pounds of trout annually from the lakes. Since 1973 the much smaller harvest has depended on restocked trout -- 2.6 million a year by Michigan at a cost of $3 million.</p>
        <p>There have been successes against predators. Forty years ago, after lampreys and overfishing caused the collapse of the predator lake trout, the population of another invader, the herringlike alewives, surged. Millions of them started washing up dead on the beaches of Lake Michigan. The huge die-off during spring spawning season was attributed to ''winter thermal stress, high abundance and shortage of food'' for the alewives, said Gavin Christie of the Fishery Commission.</p>
        <p>But now, restocked trout, together with large stocks of chinook and coho salmon introduced for sport fishing, have ''pushed alewives just about up against the wall in Lake Huron,'' said James E. Johnson of the Michigan Department of Resources station.</p>
        <p>The restocked trout, however, seldom reproduce, Mr. Johnson said, and they remain vulnerable to lampreys, which account for 50 percent of lake trout mortality in Huron.</p>
        <p>In an effort to go after the lamprey, Roger Bergstedt, head of the United States Geological Survey's biological research station at Hammond Bay, Mich., has spent eight years mapping 12,000 lamprey larval habitats in St. Mary's River, which links Lake Superior to Lake Huron. The work was part of an American-Canadian program to put lampricides in the roughly 300 tributary streams where the lampreys spawn.</p>
        <p>Applying lampricides to 30 hot spots, Mr. Bergstedt reduced the population to about 10 percent of its peak, he believes. Last year $4.5 million was spent on lampricide.</p>
        <p>Calling the effort ''highly successful,'' Mr. Bergstedt said the future focus would be on ''new weapons in this war to reduce reliance on chemical control, like pheromones.''</p>
