        <p>The delegation from the great state of Florida may want to brag from the convention floor about its championship college football team, while the great state of Wisconsin may seek to tout its mouthwatering cheeses. But those gushy expressions of state pride may not command the same level of attention this year as they have at previous party conventions.</p>
        <p>Saying the traditional roll call of states has become too long and dull to sustain an evening of prime time television, officials planning the Republican National Convention said yesterday that they intended to dim the spotlight on the state-by-state presidential nominating process by spreading the tally over three nights.</p>
        <p>''One giant chunk of time devoted to counting votes may be gripping if you are a floor clerk in the House or Senate,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the presumptive Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. ''But for 249 million other Americans, it's not as captivating.'' Convention officials have told the networks the votes will occur earlier in each evening's program.</p>
        <p>The establishment of the ''rolling roll call,'' subject to the approval of the party's rules committee, is one of a number of innovations the Republicans say they have developed to make their convention in Philadelphia more palatable and engaging to viewers. It is a gathering, vowed Andrew Card, the convention's general co-chairman, ''that is going to look, sound and feel different from the conventions of the past.''</p>
        <p>It is also a gathering, some professional convention watchers said, that will further advance the evolution of the event into a marketing vehicle. Steve Scully, political editor of C-Span, which will provide pool television coverage of the proceedings, said the conventions were traditionally platforms for governors and senators to speak on the issues that concerned them. The plan for prime time outlined by Mr. Card involved speeches by just two elected officials: Mr. Bush and Senator John McCain of Arizona.</p>
        <p>''The era of political conventions being just for politicians is changing, and may be over,'' Mr. Scully said. ''Now you have conventions that are timed to the minute, to the second for the hometown audience. It's a production, not a convention.''</p>
        <p>Others who were given prime time slots include Mr. Bush's wife, Laura; Gen. Colin L. Powell, former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Mr. Bush's adviser on security and foreign policy issues, Condoleezza Rice; and former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole. Mr. Card said that while it is not certain anyone will be designated as the keynote speaker, more people may be added to the speakers' list. The vice-presidential nominee will speak on the convention's third night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Card, speaking with reporters by conference call yesterday, said the departures from tradition would be apparent in everything from the benevolent tone of the proceedings -- attacks on the opposition will be kept to a minimum, he said -- to the design of the dais. The dais traditionally ''looked like the turret of a castle,'' Mr. Card said, adding that this year it ''will look more like a stage,'' giving the Republicans more flexibility for performances by entertainers and ''short presentations from people across America.''</p>
        <p>The slogan for the convention, which begins on July 31, is ''Renewing America's Purpose. Together.'' Mr. Card said there will be a specific theme on each of the evenings: education and health care on Monday, military strength on Tuesday and prosperity and protecting Social Security on Wednesday. Thursday will be devoted to Mr. Bush, who will deliver his acceptance speech.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain, for example, will speak on the evening devoted to the military, Mr. Card said.</p>
        <p>Republican officials said they were aware of the need to make the event as attractive as possible to the networks, and one network news official, who spoke on condition on anonymity, called the rolling roll call a ''very smart'' idea because the broadcast networks had no interest in airing the vote in prime time.</p>
        <p>While cable channels like CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC plan gavel-to-gavel coverage, the more heavily watched broadcast networks are scaling back.</p>
