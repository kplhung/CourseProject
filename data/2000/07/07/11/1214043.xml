        <p>If you can't be at Camp David, Beirut is about as good a vantage point as any for watching the Palestinian-Israeli summit talks, because Lebanon has many lessons, some obvious, some subtle, to offer the negotiators.</p>
        <p>Lebanon, first off, is a reminder of what happened when Israelis and Palestinians tried to resolve their differences not with diplomacy but with brute force during that long hot summer of 1982.

        <p>If you can't be at Camp David, Beirut is about as good a vantage point as any for watching the Palestinian-Israeli summit talks, because Lebanon has many lessons, some obvious, some subtle, to offer the negotiators.</p>
        <p>Lebanon, first off, is a reminder of what happened when Israelis and Palestinians tried to resolve their differences not with diplomacy but with brute force during that long hot summer of 1982. At that time Israel still entertained the fantasy of solving the Palestinian problem by wiping out the P.L.O., and the P.L.O. entertained the fantasy that armed struggle could win back at least all of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. But the Israeli-Palestinian war in Lebanon was a war with no winner. All sides lost.</p>
        <p>A short time later, Lebanon taught the Israelis another lesson -- that simply because Israel has more power doesn't mean it is in its interest to cram a deal down the other side's throat. On May 17, 1983, with the help of a very foolish Reagan administration, Israel's Likud government imposed a peace settlement on Lebanon, which gave Israel a permanent security presence in South Lebanon. The Lebanese prime minister at the time literally cried after signing the treaty. The May 17 agreement, though, was never implemented. Because it had no legitimacy in Lebanese society it had no roots, and therefore no staying power. The only thing the May 17 agreement gave birth to was a war against Israel by the Hezbollah Shiite guerrillas -- which eventually forced a unilateral Israeli withdrawal -- and a virulent anti-American campaign that culminated in the blowing up of a U.S. Marine barracks, killing 241 servicemen.</p>
        <p>But what is most intriguing is the latest lesson from Lebanon -- the one being taught by Hezbollah. Who said the following on TV here the other day? ''The political class in Lebanon got so self-absorbed in its rules and games that it is not aware of globalization and competition and the requirements to succeed today. . . . You cannot work anymore on the assumption that we should not change our ways to meet the challenges of peace and in order to become a productive economy.''</p>
        <p>No, it wasn't the minister of finance. It was Haj Hussein al Haj-Hassan, a Hezbollah Parliament member from Baalbek. In the wake of driving the Israelis out of South Lebanon, Hezbollah has turned its focus inward to satisfy what it knows its constituency now wants most -- jobs, better schools, development, an end to corruption and integration with global trends, not more war.</p>
        <p>''You cannot imagine how tired people are of this conflict and all the old political sloganeering,'' remarked Jamil Mroue, editor of The Beirut Daily Star, ''and the party here that understands that best is precisely the party that has been most removed from traditional Lebanese politics -- Hezbollah.''</p>
        <p>Hezbollah first leapfrogged over the old politics here by not being afraid of the Israelis, but now, having evicted them from South Lebanon, Hezbollah is turning its attention to the economic and social aspirations of its rank and file.</p>
        <p>So what's the lesson? Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel may be coming to Camp David without the support of all the traditional, small-minded ethnic parties in Israel. But I guarantee you, 60 to 70 percent of the Israeli people are with Mr. Barak. That is, they are ready for a real and fair deal, including hard compromises, provided the bottom line reads ''The End'' -- the end of this conflict so Israelis can really get on with life.</p>
        <p>The divisions in the Israeli Parliament, like those in the Lebanese Parliament, represent the old politics of ethnic and religious division. But remember, Mr. Barak himself was directly elected by the Israeli people -- precisely to bring about a final peace. He still comes to Washington with a strong mandate for that.</p>
        <p>Speaking of elections, Bashar al-Assad was ''elected'' president of Syria last night to succeed his father. On the eve of Bashar's election, what did he do? Give a speech attacking Israel? No, he ended government controls on auto imports, enabling any Syrian to import a car.</p>
        <p>Bottom line: I don't know whether Yasir Arafat and Mr. Barak will be able to achieve what they both will consider a fair deal. But I do know this: If they do, they will each find solid silent majorities at home to embrace it, because growing underneath the old politics out here is a new politics. It may not make as much noise as the old politics, but it has a lot more support than you think.</p>
