        <p>The Protestant Orange Order succeeded in practically shutting down Northern Ireland today.</p>
        <p>Cities and villages turned into ghost towns with only army and police vehicles moving about the streets.</p>
        <p>The summons to paralyze Ulster came from the chapter of the order in Portadown, County Armagh, which was angered at being barred from parading on Sunday down an avenue running through a Catholic neighborhood after annual commemorative services at Drumcree Church. The militants were already vehemently opposed to the new power-sharing Catholic-Protestant government.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the parade has been the flash point for firebombings in the town center, riots on the hillside at whose crest stands the unadorned, 18th century Drumcree Church, and for widespread disruptions across the province.</p>
        <p>With the violence of the past week, Protestant church leaders and some Orange Order senior officers have criticized the Portadown lodge for leaving the organization open to the charge of fomenting disorder. But but Harold Gracey, 63, the group's district master, has refused to condemn the violence and has urged members to continue taking to the streets.</p>
        <p>Eight straight nights of violence across the province have brought a familiar tension back to life, and the motivation for businesses closing at midday could have reflected the fear of being caught up in the protests as much as of showing support for the militants.</p>
        <p>Public transportation halted early to forestall bus hijackings and burnings, and people were seen running through downtown streets to make their homebound connections before midafternoon.</p>
        <p>Intimidation also was a factor in clearing the streets. Neighbors of a municipal pool operator in Portadown said he had received telephone calls warning that if there were any cars in his parking lot by 3 p.m., he would be ''burned out.''</p>
        <p>At a time when the Protestant community is increasingly fractious and insecure, many people have been unnerved by the presence at demonstrations of Johnny Adair, known as ''Mad Dog,'' a recently released paramilitary leader with a shaved head, muscular bearing and cold-eyed glower. His group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, is held responsible in a new book called ''Lost Lives'' for the killings of more than 400 people, most of them Catholic civilians, over the past 30 years.</p>
        <p>The police suspect that some of the nighttime disorder is being coordinated by Protestant paramilitary groups, which, although on cease-fire, have the capability to send marauding youths and masked members into the streets. Adding to the volatility, Protestant paramilitaries are themselves at loggerheads, with one group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, accusing the Ulster Freedom Fighters of being behind gun attacks last week against officers of the province's police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary.</p>
        <p>At highway junctures across Ulster, some of the 80,000 Orange Order members, their wives and children gathered in milling groups to shut down traffic. Roadblocks of hastily nailed-together wooden slats were thrown up on city corners during the declared 4 to 8 p.m. protest period and then set on fire once darkness fell.</p>
        <p>Demonstrators surged at police lines and shouted abuse at officers in various towns, but while daylight held, there were none of the car burnings and firebombings of recent nights. Police reported skirmishes with protesters in Portadown and Drumcree throwing rocks and bottles at officers who responded with water cannons.</p>
        <p>David Trimble, the First Minister of the new Northern Ireland Assembly and leader of the largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, appealed for calm, saying that anyone resorting to violence would ''dishonor and disgrace the cause they profess to support.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble, once a Portadown Orange Order marcher himself, is a pariah with the organization now, since it is vehemently opposed to the new government he heads. The government was set up by the April, 1998 peace accord that was aimed at putting an end to three decades of sectarian struggles that have cost more than 3,600 lives. Mr. Trimble has barely kept his leadership of the Ulster Unionists in two recent votes that have exposed yet another fissure in the Protestant ranks between moderates and hard-liners.</p>
        <p>The Portadown Orangemen said they were staging their shutdown of the province to persuade the government-appointed Parades Commission to reverse its decision to bar them from marching down the Garvaghy Road, a thoroughfare into town lined on either side by Catholic housing blocks.</p>
        <p>But Peter Mandelson, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, said that ''every stone, every missile, every petrol bomb will militate against'' that goal. Mr. Mandelson said he firmly backed the commission's declaration that the only way for the Portadown Orangemen to march down the Garvaghy Road was to enter into dialogue with the people living along it. The Portadown lodge members have refused to speak directly to the residents or to meet with members of the Parades Commission.</p>
        <p>This was the third straight year that the panel had ruled against the Portadown Orangemen. Portadown is known as the Protestant citadel because the Orange Order was founded there in 1795, and the parade from the downtown lodge hall out Dungannon Street to Drumcree and then back along the Garvaghy Road dates from 1807. There are 2,500 Protestant parades that go off without incident in Northern Ireland each summer. They mark epochal Protestant moments like the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, when William of Orange, the King of England, overcame his Catholic rival, James II.</p>
        <p>Protestants consider them proud expressions of their culture. Catholics complain that they are reminders of the supremacy Protestants long held over them here.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 13, 2000, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about a protest in Northern Ireland by the Protestant Orange Order, which wants the province to remain part of Britain, misstated where the order was founded. It was in Loughall, near Portadown, not in Portadown.</p>
