        <p>President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada's center-right party made strong advances in the Chamber of Deputies and Senate in the balloting last week but failed to win a majority in either house and will need to form legislative coalitions to pass laws, according to official election results.</p>
        <p>The congressional delegation of the governing party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, shrunk dramatically. But it will start the legislative session that begins on Sept. 1 with the largest voting bloc, the results show.</p>
        <p>Yet a series of squabbles in which party members have blamed one another and President Ernesto Zedillo for their defeat raises doubts about whether the party will vote as a disciplined unit, as it has in the past.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox's National Action Party won 208 seats in the 500-member Chamber of Deputies, the lower house. The governing party won 209, and the main leftist grouping, the Party of the Democratic Revolution, won 53. Five small parties won the remaining seats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox will need to attract 43 votes to reach the majority of 251 needed to pass his budget and other initiatives in the chamber. The Green Party, which Mr. Fox ran with in an election alliance and which elected 15 members, will almost certainly vote with Mr. Fox, said Jeffrey A. Weldon, a political scientist at the Autonomous Technological Institute here.</p>
        <p>''Fox doesn't have a majority, but he's close enough to build majorities issue by issue,'' Mr. Weldon said. ''He'll be able to negotiate some kind of coalition for almost everything he wants to get passed.''</p>
        <p>National Action added 86 seats to the delegation that it fielded after the last federal balloting, in 1997, when the party elected 122 deputies, the results show. The gains by Mr. Fox's party and the smaller parties came at the expense of the governing party, which lost 30 seats in the voting on July 2, and at the expense of the leftist party, which lost 72.</p>
        <p>In the 128-seat Senate, the governing party won 60 seats, National Action won 46, Democratic Revolution won 15, the Greens won 5 and two small parties won the remaining 2, the results show.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the balloting, in which National Action got 38.1 percent and the governing party 36.7 percent of the votes for Senate nationwide, it appeared that National Action would receive more seats than the governing party.</p>
        <p>But under the formula that allocates Senate posts, the governing party received 14 more seats than National Action, largely because the the governing party received the most votes for Senate in two more states than Mr. Fox's party and came in second in many more states.</p>
        <p>The Federal Electoral Institute released the final returns on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox has made conciliatory statements to both the governing party and to the leftist party since his election. But leaders of both parties have largely rebuffed his overtures.</p>
        <p>The results of the balloting for local posts in Mexico City could give Mr. Fox some leverage, Mr. Weldon said.</p>
        <p>The leftist party's mayoral candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, was elected. But Mr. Fox's party won 34 seats in the 66-seat City Council, which means that Mr. Lopez Obrador will need National Action's help in passing all his local initiatives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox could offer National Action's cooperation in the council in return for Mr. Lopez Obrador's help in securing the votes of about 10 leftist deputies who represent Mexico City in the federal congress, Mr. Weldon said.</p>
