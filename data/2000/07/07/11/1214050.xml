        <p>We called it ''chin music,'' the high inside fastball that would flip a batter onto his back and get him thinking. It was also known as a ''beanball'' or ''purpose pitch'' because it had so many purposes: intimidation of a hot hitter, retaliation for having had one of your players ''dusted off,'' behavior modification for showboats and hot dogs.</p>
        <p>The nicknames alone testify to its significance. In the 1950's, Sal (the Barber) Maglie of the New York Giants was famous for giving hitters ''a close shave.''</p>
        <p>Compared with the high inside throwers of my era like Don Drysdale and Bob Gibson, I was a sissy, even though I threw hard. Pitching for the Yankees against the Kansas City A's in 1963, I broke Wayne Causey's wrist with an inside fastball and ran up to home plate to see how he was. My teammates told me afterward that this was bad form. Even if it was an accident, they said, you should never let the other team know. It never hurts to let them think about it.</p>
        <p>Could that be why Roger Clemens didn't rush to home plate to check on Mike Piazza's condition after he hit the Mets catcher in the head on Saturday night? Maybe Clemens didn't care, but maybe he was just following the code. Too often in sports, any sign of humanity is perceived as weakness.</p>
        <p>The Mets players and fans accused Clemens of deliberately throwing at Piazza's head, but Clemens insisted that he was only trying to brush Piazza back from the plate. How do you know if a pitcher is intentionally throwing at a batter? Sometimes it's obvious to umpires and other close observers from the demeanor of the players or from the context. Most of the time it's not obvious and the pitcher gets away with it.</p>
        <p>In the course of my career, I only threw at one hitter on purpose. This was during my first year, pitching for the Kearney Yankees in the Class D Nebraska State League.</p>
        <p>Everybody on the team, including our kindly old manager, wanted to nail a guy on the Holdredge White Sox who actually played with file-sharpened spikes and who we caught lobbing balls into the air, during our infield practice, that would land among us like mortar shots.</p>
        <p>On our clubhouse wall someone had drawn the outline of this player in a batting stance, with sections marked like the cow illustration in the butcher shop. It was a contest for the pitchers, with certain areas being worth more points. I faced him only once, in relief, and threw the first pitch behind his head, which is what you do when you're serious, because the hitter's first move is usually back. But the guy froze and the ball hit his bat and came bouncing back to me for an easy out.</p>
        <p>I've never had much respect for pitchers who use high inside fastballs to intimidate hitters, especially in the American League, where the designated hitter rule allows a pitcher to avoid the rough justice of a turn at bat.</p>
        <p>Was Clemens trying to intimidate Piazza or, even worse, trying to hit him? We know the context was that Piazza had gotten seven hits, including three home runs, in 12 at-bats against Clemens in their previous confrontations. Without Piazza in the lineup, the Mets lost to Clemens for the first time.</p>
        <p>But evidently the umpires didn't feel they had enough evidence to eject Clemens, or even warn him at the time. Everyone has an opinion about what happened on Saturday night. But only the pitcher knows for sure.</p>
