        <p>You're not getting older, you're getting better. At least psychologically.</p>
        <p>That's the argument put forth in a new study by a University of California psychologist, who says most people become better adjusted as they age. Which is not to say they are necessarily any happier.</p>
        <p>''Really, there's not a direct connection between psychological health and happiness,'' said the psychologist, Dr. Constance J. Jones, the author of the report in the current issue of Psychology and Aging. ''Psychological health, actually, is a more complicated construct.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Jones, an associate professor at the university's Fresno campus, came to her conclusions after studying evaluations of 236 people done over a 50-year period. Participants were interviewed at ages 14, 18, 30, 40, 50 and 62.</p>
        <p>Interviewers gauged psychological health by trying to determine if subjects were responsible and dependable, whether they were productive and whether they had good relationships.</p>
        <p>''We found from analyzing our three groups that psychological health steadily increased from 30 years of age,'' the authors wrote.</p>
        <p>Of course, Dr. Jones said, this applies to the average person, with the normal levels of anxiety and other neuroses. People who have serious psychological problems will not necessarily see improvements as they age.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jones also found that, contrary to general belief, psychological health in adolescence was not shaky.</p>
        <p>And the more balanced the adolescent, she said, the better the outlook for the adult.</p>
