        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki today signed into law a bill that for the first time imposes harsher sentences on criminals in New York who single out their victims on the basis of sexual orientation, race, religion or age.</p>
        <p>In signing the legislation, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, reiterated his view that crimes spurred by bias can pose a greater threat than other crimes to the victims and to society as a whole. ''People who act on hate need to know that their punishment will be swift, severe and just,'' he said.</p>

        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki today signed into law a bill that for the first time imposes harsher sentences on criminals in New York who single out their victims on the basis of sexual orientation, race, religion or age.</p>
        <p>In signing the legislation, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, reiterated his view that crimes spurred by bias can pose a greater threat than other crimes to the victims and to society as a whole. ''People who act on hate need to know that their punishment will be swift, severe and just,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Hate crimes do more than threaten the safety and welfare of our citizens,'' he added. ''They disrupt entire communities and cannot be tolerated. By signing this legislation today, we are insuring that these heinous acts, so inherently destructive to our society, will no longer be tolerated.''</p>
        <p>The version approved today marks the first time the words ''gay'' and ''lesbian'' or the phrase ''sexual orientation'' appear anywhere in the dozens of volumes of New York State laws. The Republican Senate had balked for years at including any language pertaining to gays or sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>Under the new law, a judge or jury weighing a defendant's guilt or innocence will also be asked to say whether the defendant, beyond a reasonable doubt, chose the victim because of prejudice. If a guilty verdict is returned, the defendant will face a longer prison term if there is a finding of bias than if there is not.</p>
        <p>For low-level felonies, the maximum penalty will increase by three years. For more serious crimes, the additional term for a bias crime will be greater -- adding a decade or more to the possible sentence in some cases.</p>
        <p>The new law also requires all of the state's law enforcement agencies to keep statistics on bias crimes and the groups singled out, something that only a few police agencies now do.</p>
        <p>Under the law, a jury or judge can find that a crime was motivated by prejudice even when the defendant was mistaken about the victim's identity. For instance, a defendant who believed his victim was Hispanic can be convicted of a hate crime even if the victim was not.</p>
