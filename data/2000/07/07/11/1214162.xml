        <p>With Roger Clemens and Mike Piazza a hot topic of discussion among players in Atlanta, Barry Bonds spoke out in defense of Clemens yesterday, perhaps an unusual position for a hitter when another hitter has been hit in the head with a pitch.</p>
        <p>''I've known Roger Clemens for a long time,'' the San Francisco left fielder said of the Yankee pitcher who beaned the Mets' catcher on Saturday night, forcing Piazza to miss the All-Star Game tonight. ''I played against him in college days. I've never known Roger Clemens to intentionally try to hit somebody in the head.''</p>
        <p>''I've never seen it throughout his whole career. He has too much class. He has five Cy Youngs. Why would you stoop to that level now?''</p>
        <p>''It might have got away from him, but I don't know. It's just my personal opinion about Roger Clemens. It's unfortunate for Mike Piazza. He has his opinion. He said he lost respect for Roger Clemens.''</p>
        <p>''He's a hitter, if it happened to me, I'd probably say the same thing. But I've never known Roger Clemens to try to purposely hurt someone like that.''</p>
        <p>SELIG CALLS A MEETING: Major League Baseball owners have been summoned to New York for a meeting with Commissioner Bud Selig on Friday. They expect to discuss the status of the 2001 schedule, the likelihood of an unbalanced schedule, the idea of rotating divisions for interleague play and the diminishing prospects of realignment for next season.</p>
        <p>Most important, however, they will receive the report from the blue-ribbon task force on baseball economics that Selig appointed a year and a half ago.</p>
        <p>The task force included four outside members -- Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; George Mitchell, former majority leader of the United States Senate; Richard Levin, president of Yale University; and the columnist George Will.</p>
        <p>The committee was exclusively a management group, however. No members of the Players Association or individuals named by the union were invited to join the panel.</p>
