        <p>Stockwell Day, the new leader of Canada's opposition going into elections expected next spring, offers a conservative face rarely associated with Canadian politicians: support for a flat income tax, tougher sentencing for criminals and beefed up military spending.</p>
        <p>But his sudden sweep to national prominence, culminating with his decisive election Saturday night as leader of the new Canadian Alliance Party, seems vaguely familiar, leading some commentators to call him the Pierre Trudeau of the right.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Trudeau, a Liberal prime minister who came to power on the wings of Trudeaumania at age 48, Mr. Day, 49, comes along at a time when more and more Canadians say they are weary of an aging prime minister, in this case Jean Chretien. Now 66, Mr. Chretien was first elected to Parliament when John F. Kennedy was in the White House.</p>
        <p>Posing in a sweat-soaked muscle shirt, playing drums with a jazz quartet in Montreal or maneuvering a kayak, Mr. Day projects physical energy and the promise of a generational turnover. When Liberals try to paint him as a right-wing extremist, his aides pull out his wedding photos, complete with long hair and sideburns, snapped near the time when Mr. Day, by his own admission, was smoking marijuana.</p>
        <p>The Alliance is the successor to the Reform Party, a western-based group, and it has been rapidly growing by depleting the ranks of the Progressive Conservatives.</p>
        <p>A former auctioneer and now master of the sound bite, Canada's new conservative phenomenon has invited Joe Clark, a former prime minister and leader of the rival Progressive Conservative Party, to join forces with the Alliance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Day, in his victory address on Saturday night, said: ''Joe, I reach out to you once again with respect and sincerity. You served this country well, but it is only in that TV series, 'Survivor,' that the last person on the island is the winner.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark has vowed to fight on, even though his party suffers defections almost daily. Most recently, his lone member of Parliament from Ontario, Jim Jones, announced that he would run for re-election as a fusion candidate for both parties.</p>
        <p>One Liberal strategist, Warren Kinsella, dismisses Mr. Day, who was formerly treasurer of Alberta, as ''Archie Bunker on rollerblades.'' But the ruling party appears nervous about his emergence as the leader of Canada's right.</p>
        <p>''Although opinion polls suggest Jean Chretien's Liberals are unbeatable, there is a weariness with the prime minister's unhurried style that a young, energetic leader might be able to exploit,'' The Toronto Star, Canada's largest-circulation newspaper and a traditional Liberal backer, said in an editorial on Sunday.</p>
        <p>In a Compas poll released on Saturday by the National Post, a conservative newspaper that backs Mr. Day, the gap between the Alliance and the Liberals had been narrowed greatly, with the Liberals winning 44 percent of voter preferences and the Alliance 25 percent.</p>
        <p>In the last election, in 1997, Mr. Chretien's Liberals took only 38 percent of the popular vote, but were returned to power because the conservative vote was split, delivering almost all of Ontario's seats to Liberals. Mr. Chretien is expected to call an election next spring, telling a television interviewer two weeks ago: ''I am not a loser. I love a good fight, and I want to win.''</p>
        <p>Turning to the Alliance's proposal to lower the federal income tax to 17 percent across the board, from a top rate of 29 percent, the prime minister told the parliamentary television network: ''I think there is more to life than money. There is the quality of life and the extraordinary quality of Canadian society.''</p>
        <p>Apparently fearing losses of parliamentary seats in Ontario, Canada's electoral powerhouse, the Liberal government recently announced a $500 million aid package to Atlantic Canada, the four eastern provinces where unemployment rates are above the national average.</p>
        <p>''Any dolt can see that the Liberal caucus, unnerved by the fresh face of Stockwell Day, knows it can never again win 101 of Ontario's 103 seats, the only thing that keeps the Chretien government in power,'' Allan Fotheringham, a veteran political commentator, wrote in Maclean's magazine.</p>
        <p>To the dismay of the Liberals, Mr. Day's election represents a resounding defeat of Preston Manning, a leader of Canadian conservatives since the late 1980's.</p>
        <p>In a dramatic personal gamble, Mr. Manning, a 58-year-old veteran campaigner, resigned as opposition leader this spring and threw open to all comers the race for the leadership of the Alliance, after it succeeded the Reform Party. Membership in the Alliance tripled in three months, hitting 202,000. But the new members voted heavily for Mr. Day, giving him a 63 to 37 percent victory.</p>
        <p>Liberals preferred Mr. Manning, who failed twice in the 1990's to win any seats for the Reform Party east of the prairies.</p>
        <p>In defeat, Mr. Manning was gracious, referring in his concession speech to conservatives' dreams of occupying the official residence of Canada's prime minister: ''Stock, we are all behind you, 200,000 strong, and tonight I join with all our members in giving you the mandate to knock on the door of 24 Sussex Drive, on behalf of all Canadians, and to say, 'Mr. Chretien, your time is up.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Day not only won decisively, but he spread the party's reach deep into Ontario. In provisional returns from Saturday's voting, almost 40 percent more votes were cast in Ontario than in Alberta, the party's birthplace. Unlike Mr. Manning, Mr. Day speaks French and seems to have the capability of extending his party into Quebec, where anti-Ottawa feelings sometimes mesh with western conservatism.</p>
        <p>The strong endorsement of Alberta's former treasurer underscores how this province has set much of Canada's ideological agenda in recent years, spurring the rest of the nation to follow its example in balancing budgets, reducing government debt and cutting taxes.</p>
        <p>''For almost half a century since Confederation, the interplay of Ontario and Quebec has dominated our national politics,'' John Duffy wrote recently in Saturday Night, a Toronto-based magazine. ''Now the west is asserting itself as a full and equal political partner in the federation.''</p>
