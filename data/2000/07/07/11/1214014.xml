        <p>In the end the play's the thing, and neither a gimmick nor a couple of surprises are sufficient to elevate ''Eat the Runt'' to the ranks of must-see entertainment.</p>
        <p>In fact by the end of the evening at the Mefisto Theater Company production at Altered Stages, the cast has probably had more sustained fun than the audience.</p>
        <p>That's because no performer knows which role he will play until just before the figurative curtain goes up on this comedy by Avery Crozier about role playing and survival as applied to a museum's search for a new grants manager.</p>
        <p>The gimmick of ''Eat the Runt'' is that each actor is prepared to play every role, and that at every performance members of the audience chosen by a drawing of ticket stubs proceed to pull a ball from each of two buckets. One ball contains the name of a character; the other the name of an actor who is then required to play that role, regardless of sex, race or age.</p>
        <p>So the actors are surely on their mettle, although ''Eat the Runt'' is not notable for a wide spectrum of personalities among the museum personnel involved in interviewing the applicants for the vacant position. Nevertheless the random nature of the casting generates an occasional frisson when the reality of a performer runs counter to the lines of the play, as when a black actor is told he is not part African.</p>
        <p>The surprises of ''Eat the Runt'' are nicely executed, but getting to them lies along a path littered with longueurs, and even the actors must pray for luck to bring them the role of Merritt, ably played on a recent night by LaKeith Hoskin, the manipulative and well-prepared applicant who lends the comedy's succession of interviews their intermittent spirit and serves as the catalyst for the play's scattershot humor.</p>
        <p>EAT THE RUNT</p>
        <p>By Avery Crozier; directed by Peter Hawkins; produced by Matthew von Waaden; sets, Jerome Martin; costumes, Courtney McClain; original music and design, Will Pitts; lighting, Michele Disco. Presented by the Mefisto Theater Company. At Altered Stages, 219 West 29th Street, Chelsea.</p>
        <p>WITH: Kelli K. Barnett, LaKeith Hoskin, Katrishka King, Myles O'Connor, Weil Richmond, Curtis Mark Williams and Jama Williamson.</p>
