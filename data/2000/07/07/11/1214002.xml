        <p>How Tomatoes Grow</p>
        <p>In the campy 1970's horror spoof ''Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,'' the planet is threatened by giant mutated tomatoes (much as the average garden is threatened by overgrown tomato plants about this time of year). The good guys won in the film, of course, but things might have been easier had they known about some research at Cornell.</p>
        <p>Long before the age of the two-pound beefsteak, tomatoes were much smaller. In fact, the precursor to the domesticated tomato produced fruit that were less than a half-inch in diameter and weighed a fraction of an ounce. But through domestication, tomatoes grew in size.</p>
        <p>The Cornell researchers, reporting in the journal Science, have uncovered the gene responsible for this evolutionary size growth.</p>
        <p>The area of the tomato plant chromosome responsible for this growth had been identified previously, but the new research pinpoints the specific gene. The finding may help in understanding the function of genes that control quantitative traits -- that is, ones that vary by degree, rather than all or nothing.</p>
        <p>In the film, the tomatoes are defeated through the playing of an awful teenage love ballad, which causes the killer fruit to shrink (after which they are stomped into puree). The Cornell researchers found a different way to get the same result: they took the size-growth gene from a wild tomato plant and inserted it into a domesticated one, and the new fruits were much smaller.</p>
        <p>Tiger Deaths Investigated</p>
        <p>Veterinarians are still trying to figure out exactly what killed 10 Bengal tigers at a zoo in eastern India last week.</p>
        <p>The animals, seven of which were rare white tigers, died within about 36 hours last Wednesday and Thursday at the Nandankanan zoo near Bhubaneshwar, the capital of Orissa.</p>
        <p>Initial reports said the tigers died of trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, a parasitic infection. But there were conflicting accounts that medication the animals received may have been to blame. The Indian government established a team of six veterinary experts to investigate.</p>
        <p>The zoo had housed 56 Bengal tigers, including 32 white ones, the largest collection of white tigers in captivity (the white fur is the result of a recessive gene).</p>
        <p>India has an estimated 3,500 wild tigers. The animals are considered endangered, and India has set up a nationwide network of preserves to help protect them. Still, 200 to 300 are lost yearly, either from habitat lost to development or from poaching. Tiger bones have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat rheumatism and arthritis, among other conditions.</p>
        <p>Butterfly Warning</p>
        <p>Travel alert for tourists motoring through the Sierra Nevada: make sure the windshield washer tank is full before heading up that mountain pass.</p>
        <p>An ecologist at the University of California at Davis says that the summer bug-smashing season could be particularly intense this year and that the culprit is the California tortoise shell butterfly.</p>
        <p>The insects, which have wings that are orange and black on top and brown underneath, are due for an outbreak this year, according to the scientist, Dr. Art Shapiro, who has studied butterfly populations for nearly three decades.</p>
        <p>The tortoise shell migrates from coastal and foothill regions of California into the higher Sierra, and by middle to late July new offspring emerge and head even higher up in the hills, above the tree line.</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Shapiro, large numbers of the insects were spotted over the Memorial Day weekend, but the situation may get far worse this month. This summer may be as bad as one in the early 1970's, when millions of butterflies splattered onto car windshields and piles of dead insects littered the roadsides. It was a pain for motorists, but local birds had a field day.</p>
