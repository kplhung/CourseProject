        <p>One of Europe's longest and most public corporate mating dances -- the merger discussions between Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank -- could continue for a few more weeks. Bank officials confirmed they were considering an arrangement under which the two banks would form a single holding company and then organize individual businesses like retail banking and asset management into separate corporations. The approach is similar to one attempted in the failed merger this spring between Dresdner and Deutsche Bank. It would allow Allianz, the giant German insurer that is Dresdner's biggest shareholder, to buy a stake in the retail banking unit and perhaps other entities as well.</p>
