        <p>Tens of thousands of pilgrims from around world have trekked to San Salvador, El Salvador, since end of civil conflict to seek out Jesuit residence, where soldiers killed six priests and their housekeeper and daughter in 1989, as well as chapel of local hospital, where Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, was shot dead during Mass in 1980; have transformed both places into local shrines; others also visit place in countryside where four American churchwomen were killed by soldiers in December 1980; maps; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Like a testament to life's stubborn triumph, a rose garden filled with thick, fragrant blossoms rises at the site where soldiers killed six Jesuit priests at the Jose Simeon Canas Central American University in 1989. Nearby, a votive candle flickers in the room where the soldiers then killed a housekeeper and her daughter, hoping to eliminate any witnesses.</p>

        <p>Like a testament to life's stubborn triumph, a rose garden filled with thick, fragrant blossoms rises at the site where soldiers killed six Jesuit priests at the Jose Simeon Canas Central American University in 1989. Nearby, a votive candle flickers in the room where the soldiers then killed a housekeeper and her daughter, hoping to eliminate any witnesses.</p>
        <p>It did not work. One woman saw the crime and helped build a case against the gunmen. More important, more than a decade since the killings, tens of thousands of people from around the world have sought out the Jesuit residence's tiny garden to bear their own witness to the faith of eight people they consider martyrs who defended the poor during this country's civil war.</p>
        <p>Invariably, these pilgrims also trek across town to the chapel at the Divine Providence Hospital where Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, a vocal opponent of the elite and the violent, was shot dead while celebrating Mass.</p>
        <p>They walk through his modest three-room house, where his bloodied vestments hang in the closet and his bedroom calendar is forever turned to the month he was killed -- March 1980. Others go to the countryside to visit the spot where four American churchwomen were also killed by soldiers in December of that year.</p>
        <p>Centuries ago, Spanish conquistadors came here for glory, gold and God. Now many visitors come to this nation whose name means the Savior searching for a more elusive treasure along modern-day Stations of the Cross. They come to conquer their own spiritual doubts, looking for lessons from priests, nuns and lay people whose embrace of liberation theology's blend of religion and social activism exacted such a brutal price.</p>
        <p>One recent afternoon, the shuffling steps of a dozen Americans from the University of Scranton blended in with the everyday sounds of barking dogs, tinny music and food sizzling in the kitchen of the Jesuit residence.</p>
        <p>Slowly, the visitors encircled the garden, where the Rev. Brendan Lally, the Roman Catholic priest leading the group, quietly knelt in prayer. Afterward he plucked a tiny sprig of clover and tucked it into his pocket, like a relic.</p>
        <p>''This is a sacred place where people gave their lives for Christ and the Gospel,'' Father Lally said, ''and their deaths make this a holy place and an eternal symbol of the work for justice. This is a faith journey. But it is also an attempt to help us as Catholics understand more deeply our mission by coming to listen deeply to the experiences of our brothers in El Salvador and the stories of the people of El Salvador.''</p>
        <p>It is a heartening sight to the Rev. Dean Brackley, a American theologian who came to El Salvador to replace his fallen Jesuit brothers at the Central American University. He sees it as a resurrection of sorts, one that is reflected in the experiences of the dozens of delegations he ushers through here each year.</p>
        <p>''This place, we export more hope than coffee,'' he said. ''With all the violence, we still export hope. That is why people still come.''</p>
        <p>Yet as strong as the attraction is for visiting delegations, the religious movement that attracts them has lost ground here. The popular church, formed of communities that grounded their political and social activism for the poor in Scripture, was once virtually the only nonviolent voice speaking out against the government during the war. Now it competes to be heard.</p>
        <p>The killings of the Jesuits and the two women drew international scorn for the government and helped to propel the peace effort that ended the war. But the popularity and influence of the grass-roots church has since waned.</p>
        <p>Former guerrilla leaders now speak freely and have entered elective politics, evangelical Protestants have recruited thousands of Salvadorans wary of an activist Catholic clergy and skeptical of political engagement, and a conservative Catholic hierarchy looks at adherents of liberation theology as sick brethren in need of more orthodox spiritual healing.</p>
        <p>''The hierarchy represents a line of thinking that does not look for repercussions or any social or political change,'' said the Rev. Rafael de Sivatte, chairman of Central American University's theology department. ''It represents a religion that only deals with personal change and repentance of sins. It is an internal religion that looks at the individual with a spirituality that is very much in the air without reference to reality.''</p>
        <p>The church's challenge in peace, he said, is to find the unity that was forged and tested to the breaking point during the civil war from 1979 to 1992. Although the conflict has ended, he said, many Salvadorans still lack jobs, housing and medical care.</p>
        <p>''We have to be even firmer than before,'' he said. ''People have lost their aspirations and are happy with small economic advances. We have to tell people not to be content with any little thing. People say if they are working and have a little money, why should they struggle for others to work? That was a great value we had in the war. But it is being lost.''</p>
        <p>Enough of the popular movement remains in parishes like San Bartolo in the town of Ilopango, where teachers from the Central American University offer theology classes to the congregation. The students, mostly working adults, take part in discussions of social justice, grounded in the Bible.</p>
        <p>''You have to read the newspaper, too, if you read Scripture,'' said Felipe Miando, a truck driver who recently enrolled in the class. ''We went through a war. In the Bible, the Israelites were subjected to the Roman Empire. We were subjected to the empire of the United States and the rich of El Salvador.''</p>
        <p>The movement for a more socially relevant religion has also been buoyed in recent months by the huge crowds that came to San Salvador to mark the 20th anniversary of Archbishop Romero's assassination, as well as to commemorate the killings at the university. Their visits are familiar to Sister Rosa Avalos, who tends to the chapel where Bishop Romero was killed.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes they come here right from the airport,'' she said. ''They want to know where a prophet, saint and martyr lived. Sometimes they come to thank God after asking Bishop Romero's intercession in everything from health, work or some difficulty they have. Their only recourse is to ask God through him.''</p>
        <p>Outside the archbishop's former home, beside a mural of him smiling by the shore of a lake, dozens of stones are embedded in a wall, each one thanking the archbishop for answered prayers. But there are more everyday miracles to be found among the pilgrims who come here.</p>
        <p>For them, the survival of the popular church has been imbued with a deep meaning that can be personal, political or both. They go to parishes in poor communities where people share their many stories and little food with them. They stand in silence at the relics of the Jesuit martyrs, including a book whose bloodstained cover reads ''The Crucified God.''</p>
        <p>''What I want to bring back to Pennsylvania with me is this spirit of community,'' said Sean Farry, a college administrator who was making his second trip to El Salvador. ''Here titles are dropped and you get to know the Salvadoran people. What I find about them is their spirituality. It strikes me as being part of their everyday lives and how they rely on their faith. When there is nothing else to depend on, they can't depend on the government to help them. They have to turn to God.''</p>
        <p>Mary Rowland stood inside the university's museum, which is dedicated to the slain clergy and lay people, shaking her head as she looked at the threadbare clothes, now darkened with blood, that the Jesuits were wearing when they were shot.</p>
        <p>''My goodness,'' she whispered. ''They took the time to get dressed. Good for them.''</p>
        <p>She said she had to come here. ''Hopefully, this will make me more sensitive to other people,'' she said. ''I want to trust people in a straightforward way. I know I fail miserably in that.''</p>
        <p>She looked at a case where tiny jars were filled with soil from where the priests died.</p>
        <p>''This should never happen again,'' she said. ''But it will.''</p>
