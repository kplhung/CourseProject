        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thomas L. Friedman suggests that Al Gore pick Bill Clinton as his running mate (''A Modest Proposal,'' column, July 7). The same reasoning suggests that George W. Bush should pick his father, the former president. The selection of George H. W. Bush would save the duplication of Secret Service teams. Also, his background has been checked, and he has the added advantage of compensating for his son's weak grasp of foreign policy.</p>
