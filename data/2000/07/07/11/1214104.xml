        <p>President Clinton toned down his partisan, ''Al Gore for President'' pronouncements today at the National Governors' Association summer conference, knowing that more than half the governors in the room had a very different take on the coming election.</p>

        <p>President Clinton toned down his partisan, ''Al Gore for President'' pronouncements today at the National Governors' Association summer conference, knowing that more than half the governors in the room had a very different take on the coming election.</p>
        <p>Instead, in what he described as a ''make-a-deal speech,'' Mr. Clinton argued before the bipartisan audience that the two parties could still make progress on a variety of issues -- like Medicare prescription drug coverage and an increase in the minimum wage -- if they toned down all the pre-election sparring.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton still made the case, without explicitly naming names, that large tax cuts like those proposed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas would endanger the longest economic expansion in the nation's history.</p>
        <p>''I think we've got to keep the economy going by hewing to the same principles of fiscal discipline that got us where we are,'' Mr. Clinton told the governors in State College, Pa. ''And that means I think whatever combination of spending and tax cuts any candidate for any office proposes, there ought to be enough left over to get us out of debt over the next dozen years.''</p>
        <p>Among those in the audience were Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a Republican who has been mentioned as a top vice presidential prospect for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Ridge said he appreciated the president's ''very conciliatory tone,'' but disagreed vigorously with Mr. Clinton on which economic plan of those proposed by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore was more sound.</p>
        <p>''As he was speaking I was thinking of George Bush's 'Prosperity With a Purpose' plan,'' Mr. Ridge said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton turned up his partisan tone later at a fund-raising speech in Philadelphia for Representative Ron Klink, who is running for Senate against Senator Rick Santorum.</p>
        <p>The president condemned Republican lawmakers for failing to endorse some blacks and Hispanics that he has nominated for federal judgeships, and he accused Republicans of ignoring the poor and elderly.</p>
        <p>But as he spoke to the governors association, the group that helped catapult him into White House, Mr. Clinton was clearly pulling his punches.</p>
        <p>''I know all the press coverage is always on the fights that we have, but let me tell you, we actually agree on things every now and then in Washington,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''And there are a lot of things we could do in the next six months.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton added: ''I ask you to help ensure an election season that is positive, open and vigorous about the real and honest differences, but devoid of the poison that has too often clouded the judgment of everybody involved in the public process.''</p>
        <p>Even as he offered his views, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that his thoughts mattered far less in these waning days of his presidency. He said his opinions plus a quarter ''will get you half a soda pop.''</p>
