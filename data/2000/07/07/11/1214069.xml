        <p>In an accord with federal officials, New York City has agreed to expand and speed up a cleanup of toxic mercury, lead and PCB's in machinery that is used to control the flow of drinking water from two of the city's upstate reservoirs.</p>
        <p>The machinery is also the subject of a separate federal criminal investigation into possible leaks of the contaminants into the water.</p>
        <p>Federal and city officials both said Friday that they had tested the drinking water and found no evidence that it had been contaminated by the machinery, which is in four gatehouses at the two reservoirs and controls half of the 1.3 billion gallons of water delivered to the city daily.</p>
        <p>But Jeanne M. Fox, the federal Environmental Protection Agency's regional administrator, said, ''Because the contaminants are in equipment that sits directly above the drinking water, it stands to reason that they have probably leaked into the drinking water over the years.''</p>
        <p>The city signed a consent order last month imposing a schedule to replace most of the equipment, which it owns, by May 2003. The city must also monitor the water weekly for leaks of contaminants and notify state and federal authorities if levels reach half of the limits in federal safe drinking-water standards.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of pounds of mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, are used in decades-old sluice gate operators, which raise and lower the gates that control water flow; manometers, which measure water flow through the gates; and actuators, which control the flow of water through the pipes that lead to and from the reservoir. The source of the lead is paint in the gatehouses.</p>
        <p>The city will spend more than $100 million to clean up the contaminants and replace the equipment at the Kensico Reservoir in Westchester County and the West Branch Reservoir in Putnam County, said Charles Sturcken, chief of staff for the City Department of Environmental Protection. In addition, the city has tested 84 current and past employees who came into contact with the machinery, and none have elevated levels of mercury, lead or PCB's, Mr. Sturcken said.</p>
        <p>Mercury, a liquid metal, is toxic in concentrations as low as several parts per billion. PCB's, formerly used in oil because they resist heat, are now recognized as a likely human carcinogen.</p>
        <p>The city has been aware of the problem for some time and began cleaning up one of the four gatehouses more than 10 years ago. But the federal agency determined last year that the work was not proceeding fast enough and began preparing a consent order to clean up all four gatehouses, said an E.P.A. spokeswoman, Nina Habib Spencer.</p>
        <p>In June 1999, Justice Department agents raided offices of the Department of Environmental Protection, responding to allegations that the city had covered up the mishandling of mercury and other toxic substances at its gatehouses. That investigation, which is continuing, is separate from the E.P.A.'s consent order with the city, Ms. Habib Spencer said.</p>
        <p>In addition, city records gave no indication of how the city had disposed of the mercury, said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chief lawyer for the environmental group Riverkeeper, who alerted the federal agency to the problem. The disposal of mercury and other toxic substances is regulated under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy hailed the consent order as a step forward, but said the city should have cleaned up the contaminants long ago.</p>
        <p>''Instead of acknowledging in an open way that there was a problem that could affect the public and their workers, they have essentially denied the problem existed,'' Mr. Kennedy said.</p>
