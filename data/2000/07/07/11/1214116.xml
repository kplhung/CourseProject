        <p>The last time I had a conversation with Michael Irvin was several years ago. It was a typically miserable hot July day in Texas, and Irvin, the Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, wasn't doing much talking. A teammate, Everett McIver, had suffered a deep cut in the neck while in a dormitory at training camp, and several published reports said Irvin had slashed McIver with scissors during an argument. Once again the charismatic Irvin was in a seedy situation.</p>
        <p>''I'm not talking,'' Irvin said as he walked off the practice field, signing autographs. ''You guys in the media are always wrong. W-R-O-N-G. You guys write this and say this about players, and criticize us, but half the time your information is wrong, and you're hypocrites, too. You guys drive drunk, do drugs, cheat on your wives. But you don't write about that.''</p>

        <p>The last time I had a conversation with Michael Irvin was several years ago. It was a typically miserable hot July day in Texas, and Irvin, the Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, wasn't doing much talking. A teammate, Everett McIver, had suffered a deep cut in the neck while in a dormitory at training camp, and several published reports said Irvin had slashed McIver with scissors during an argument. Once again the charismatic Irvin was in a seedy situation.</p>
        <p>''I'm not talking,'' Irvin said as he walked off the practice field, signing autographs. ''You guys in the media are always wrong. W-R-O-N-G. You guys write this and say this about players, and criticize us, but half the time your information is wrong, and you're hypocrites, too. You guys drive drunk, do drugs, cheat on your wives. But you don't write about that.''</p>
        <p>Before I pulled out a road map to see where this conversation was going, and before agreeing with at least part of what Irvin said -- some in the news media are indeed hypocrites -- Irvin decided he had done enough lecturing. He stomped off, ending the conversation bombastically: ''Print that.''</p>
        <p>It was typical Irvin. The passion that flowed through his veins was both invigorating and poisonous to him. It allowed him to do incredible things on the football field, and over a 12-year career Irvin developed into a dazzling player. But that same passion led to him making myriad mistakes off the field, and Irvin's name became synonymous with drug busts and rape accusations. Those bad, banana-colored suits he would wear were only matched in ugliness by the nasty legal cases he faced.</p>
        <p>Irvin will officially retire from the National Football League today, forced to give up the game he loves -- truly loves -- because of a chronic spinal condition. If Irvin continued to play he would risk permanent paralysis.</p>
        <p>When longtime players retire, they often sit down during a quiet moment and review career highlights in their heads, rolling the images back and forth as if on a VCR. There is also often an assessment: how did I contribute to the game, they ask themselves.</p>
        <p>Irvin's overall contribution is like one of his touchdown catches -- powerful and devastating. His 750 career catches rank him 10th with Charlie Joiner. Irvin also has 11,904 career reception yards, and his 87 playoff catches are second behind Jerry Rice. He demanded the ball and would tell opposing defensive backs they should be paying him for the lessons he was giving. As a player, he had almost no weaknesses. As a person, well, that was an entirely different matter.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately Irvin is one of those athletes whose career comes with an asterisk whenever it is talked about. He constantly made excuses for his bad behavior. Always excuses. Blame the woman. Or the news media. Or the police. Or that stupid judge. Irvin rarely acknowledged that many of his faults were because of his inability to control his cravings and his often wild behavior.</p>
        <p>Irvin will go down as one of the great bad-boys in football history. In 1994, he was fined $12,000 by the league for instigating a halftime fight between Cowboys and Giants players.</p>
        <p>In 1996 he was arrested in a motel room on his 30th birthday. He pleaded no contest to a felony drug charge and received 800 hours of community service and four years' probation, which just ended. He was also suspended by the league for five games. In the hotel room with Irvin was a cache of drugs and two women who described themselves as models.</p>
        <p>The arrest led to a classic Irvin lowlight: he walked into court wearing a large fur coat and sunglasses. Few were amused.</p>
        <p>Once Irvin was indeed falsely accused of a crime. In 1997, a Dallas woman lied and said Irvin and another teammate raped her. What happened in that instance was wrong. Yet Irvin spent much of his life immersed in slop, and his reputation had become so tattered that a woman was able to make up a story about him and many people believed it at first.</p>
        <p>Young N.F.L. players who want to be as good as Irvin should learn something from his dreamy but rocky career. We are no longer in a time when what a player does off the field is not part of his resume. Newspaper reporters, Internet geeks, and savvy TV types keep track of both touchdown catches and rape convictions. The crud sticks to a player like a hungry shark on a diver's leg. A Web site's memory never fades. And you can bet that when Irvin is eligible for the Hall of Fame, voters will factor in what he did off the field as well as on it, just as they did with Lawrence Taylor.</p>
        <p>From now on whenever Irvin's name is mentioned it will go something like this: ''Irvin was great, but. . . .''</p>
        <p>On the same day Irvin's retirement was announced, so was the retirement of San Francisco 49ers safety Tim McDonald, who was the anti-Irvin, a great player and a good citizen.</p>
        <p>During McDonald's 13 seasons, he had 44 career interceptions, 942 tackles, 6 Pro Bowls, and -- oh, yeah -- no arrests.</p>
