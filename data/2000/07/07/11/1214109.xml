        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>BUDGET PROBLEMS IN TEXAS  One thing George W. Bush has known in his more than five years as governor of Texas is prosperity. But now the State of Texas is facing a budget shortfall of as much as $750 million, fueled by deficits in Medicaid and other state programs and rising costs for prison inmates, according to The Houston Chronicle. Members of the Legislative Budget Board, which oversees the budget, are scheduled to meet privately with state budget officials today to plan an emergency appropriations bill for January. Rob Junell, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the state's economy would provide enough new revenues to cover the shortfall.</p>

        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>PEROT ALLY REPLACED  Ross Perot's unsuccessful effort to place a ''no endorsement'' choice on the Reform Party ballot, beside the names of candidates Patrick J. Buchanan and John Hagelin, has cost his close colleague, Russell J. Verney, his position as chairman of the convention credentials committee. Responding to complaints by the Buchanan campaign that Mr. Verney would not be impartial in settling disputes over delegates, the party chairman, Gerald R. Moan, replaced Mr. Verney with Frank Reed, the Ohio state party chairman. As many as two dozen states have competing groups of delegates. Mr. Verney said he was ''very saddened that the party leadership buckled down under pressure'' from the Buchanan campaign.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>AN UNLIKELY RUNNING MATE  Gov. Gray Davis of California came just inches yesterday from ruling himself out of the running to be Al Gore's ticket mate. Mr. Davis has frequently been mentioned as a possible choice, someone whose considerable popularity in the Golden State could help Mr. Gore win its biggest-of-all trove of electoral votes. But the job has not been offered to him, he said in an interview, and therefore he would not address a theoretical question about whether he would accept it. ''However,'' he went on, ''what I will say is that I told the people of California when they elected me in 1998 that I would serve a full four-year term, and that is what I intend to do.''</p>
