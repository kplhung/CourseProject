        <p>As the second-quarter earnings season gets into full swing this week -- with reports expected from General Electric, International Paper, Motorola, Yahoo and J. P. Morgan -- the outlook is the best it has been in years.</p>
        <p>But a look back at 1994 shows that even great earnings news may not lift stock prices much when the Federal Reserve is intent on raising interest rates to slow an overheating economy.</p>
        <p>Earnings picked up steam through most of 1994, and the companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index finished the year with a 16.4 percent gain in operating earnings, well above the average for the 90's. The stock market, meanwhile, disappointed. The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a 2.1 percent gain, while the S.&amp; P. 500 fell 1.5 percent and the Nasdaq composite dropped 3.2 percent.</p>
        <p>So far this year, the outlook for earnings is even better than it was then. In the first quarter, profits surged 23.6 percent from the year-earlier quarter, the strongest performance since the last three months of 1993, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which collects Wall Street forecasts for the 500 companies in the S.&amp; P. index. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to increase 19.2 percent, First Call says. And for the full year, analysts are forecasting 19.2 percent earnings growth, which would make this year's gain the strongest since 1993.</p>
        <p>Still, the three major stock indexes are down or flat for 2000, after hitting new highs earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The Fed's interest rate increases have taken the rally out of the market, as they did in 1994. Rising rates threaten to slow economic growth and, therefore, cut into corporate earnings. They also can raise borrowing costs for companies. And higher interest rates, when plugged into many Wall Street valuation formulas, immediately make stocks look more expensive when compared with their projected earnings.</p>
        <p>''The market hasn't made much headway because investors had an eye on the Fed,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Although Mr. Galvin says that this year's stock market performance would have been worse if profits had not been as strong, he now expects the market to be in a holding pattern until investors sense that the Fed has taken its foot off the brake.</p>
        <p>''There is still a fair amount of skepticism that the cool-down in the economy is not enough for the Fed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The power of the Fed to stymie the market is remarkable given that the projected earnings growth for this year is stronger than the actual growth proved to be in each year of the 1995-to-1999 run, when the Nasdaq and the S.&amp; P. 500 rose 20 percent or more each year and the Dow climbed 20 percent or more in four of the five.</p>
        <p>Joseph Liro, chief economist at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., warns that although earnings growth will be strong this year, the pace will slow at the end of the year and will decelerate further early next year. ''I have been fairly optimistic about earnings and remain so,'' he said. ''But it may not be good enough for investors to get excited about.''</p>
        <p>Another factor that could continue to undermine the stock market is inflation, which some analysts expect to rise even as the economy slows. During the stock market rallies since 1995, the rate of core consumer inflation, which excludes the cost of energy and food, was in decline. It fell to an annual increase of 1.9 percent last year from 3 percent in 1995. But for the three months through May, core inflation rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate.</p>
        <p>''Over the long haul, what is the most important thing for stock prices in any given quarter or any given year is the trend in inflation and the bond yield,'' said Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities.</p>
        <p>''Earnings were great in the first quarter and will be darn good in the second quarter,'' he said. ''But the reason the market indexes are slightly down is the inflation trend.''</p>
        <p>Thomas McManus, equity strategist at Banc of America Securities, sees another dark cloud in the outlook. Wall Street analysts are overestimating the strength in earnings for the rest of the year, he says, because they do not realize how far the Federal Reserve will go to slow the economy and curb inflation.</p>
        <p>He is forecasting that the earnings growth rate will decline sharply this year, falling to 9 percent by the final quarter and to zero in the first quarter of 2001. That would bring earnings growth well below the 11 percent average in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>''The only thing that is going to bring inflationary pressures down is to break through that trend line,'' Mr. McManus said. ''And that is not currently baked into analysts' forecasts.''</p>
        <p>But while strong earnings may not be able to drive the stock market much higher in the face of expected Federal Reserve rate increases, they are still a good guide to those picking stocks. Mr. McManus says investors should stick to what he calls the predictable earnings sectors, including utilities, health care, consumer products and, to a lesser extent, financials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galvin urges investors to consider health care and technology stocks because they performed the best after the Fed took its foot off the brakes in 1994.</p>
        <p>Earnings performance is far more important for stock pickers this year than it was last year, Mr. Galvin says. In 1999, companies in the Nasdaq composite index that reported operating losses had an average stock gain of 115 percent for the year. Among the companies that reported profits, the average stock gained 51 percent. So far this year, companies with losses have stock declines of 11 percent on average while companies with profits have stock gains of 10 percent on average.</p>
        <p>There is some good news in this look back at 1994, and that is what happened in 1995: the Dow average surged 33.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Once it is clear that the Federal Reserve has finished raising interest rates -- as long as the economy has not been slowed to the brink or even into a recession -- nice earnings ought to help the stock market forge ahead again.</p>
        <p>The problem is, while some analysts think the pace of economic growth is slowing enough for the Fed to take its foot off the brakes, Federal Reserve officials have not given an all-clear signal yet.</p>
