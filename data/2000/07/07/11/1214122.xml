      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In 1992, Tom Clancy embarked on a philanthropic mission worthy of Jack Ryan, the idealistic hero of his popular techno-thrillers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clancy wanted to help children who had cancer and other grave illnesses use the nascent technology of the Internet to talk with one another and learn about their diseases.</p>
        <p>The children's health network he imagined would also enable parents to search out the best doctors, no matter how disadvantaged or isolated the family might be. And it would let doctors tap into the same worldwide database to share their expertise and find the latest research.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clancy's inspiration was a 6-year-old Long Island boy, Kyle Haydock, who sent him a fan letter while the boy lay in his bed at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, ravaged by sarcoma. At the height of his fame, Mr. Clancy fell hard for Kyle and befriended him. He showered the boy with gifts, visited his hospital room and even wheeled him around Disney World. ''This little guy was a fighter,'' he later wrote in an essay.</p>
        <p>After Kyle died in 1991, Mr. Clancy set up a foundation and named it for the boy. He donated more than $4 million from his fortune and committed one-third of the proceeds from his next Jack Ryan movie, according to his lawyer and foundation records.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clancy also used his fame and political connections to persuade others to donate several million dollars more in cash and services. The captains of powerful companies like Viacom joined the foundation's board, as did big-name friends like the actor Tom Selleck.</p>
        <p>But seven years later, Mr. Clancy is scuttling the Kyle Foundation, which despite spending more than $5 million on travel, salaries, fund-raising and furniture, did not even have a Web site to show for its efforts.</p>
        <p>The demise of one of the nation's more than 700,000 charities typically unfolds without public scrutiny. Nameplates are removed from doors, checking accounts are closed, and the directors move on without comment. But the legal mud fight that has broken out in a Denver courtroom over the failure of the Kyle Foundation offers a rare glimpse at the inner workings of a celebrity charity.</p>
        <p>What went wrong is a matter of heated dispute. Mr. Clancy, in court papers, accuses the woman he hired to run the foundation of mismanagement and improper expenditures. She vehemently denies that accusation and says Mr. Clancy killed off the project at the very moment it was about to succeed.</p>
        <p>In an unusual step, the Internal Revenue Service is examining the charity's financial records to decide whether to revoke its tax-deductible status. Donors would have to pay back taxes on their gifts if they had reason to know the foundation was not performing its mission.</p>
        <p>The I.R.S., Mr. Clancy has said in a letter to the foundation's board, is ''citing long delay in product rollout, limited charitable work to date, high foundation expenses for salaries, travel and fund-raising.''</p>
        <p>Friends and associates say they do not blame Mr. Clancy for undertaking what they see as a visionary project. Several, however, faulted him for failing to keep a closer eye on a venture whose success hinged on the deft use of an infant technology.</p>
        <p>A board member who ran a $29 billion computer company said he twice told Mr. Clancy in 1997 that the foundation was foundering and that its management was weak.</p>
        <p>The 53-year-old writer, who is completing his 11th novel, brushed aside such warnings and did not act until last summer, when he dispatched an accountant and then a retired  Navy vice admiral to take a closer look at the operation, board members said.</p>
        <p>Their reports in hand, Mr. Clancy sprang into action.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 11, a Friday morning, he summoned the foundation's executive director, Katherine Gorshow, to his Maryland home and demanded that she resign, according to court papers. Then, before she could fly back to its offices in Englewood, Colo., he sent a team of former agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to secure the premises and change the locks.</p>
        <p>It was an abrupt ending to a partnership that grew from a chance meeting on the Internet to Ms. Gorshow's participation last year as a bridesmaid in Mr. Clancy's wedding.</p>
        <p>Now, Ms. Gorshow is suing the foundation in a state court in Denver, accusing it of  breach of contract and saying in court papers that she had made ''significant progress'' toward taking the health network online later this year. Indeed, new backers of the foundation, including Sybase, a software company, continue to express enthusiastic support for the project.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clancy replied in court filings this month that Ms. Gorshow misused foundation money for private purposes, including personal travel. Ms. Gorshow denied the accusations through her lawyers. Mr. Clancy declined to be interviewed for this article, saying, ''I'm gagged.''</p>
        <p>Kyle's mother, Eileen Haydock of Baldwin, N.Y., said she began having doubts about the foundation several years ago and discouraged her friends from contributing. Still, Ms. Haydock said she had nothing but admiration for Mr. Clancy and his efforts to honor her son and help sick children. ''I think he felt that he had let down my son,'' she said, ''and that's not true.''</p>
        <p>There was little about Mr. Clancy's life that prepared him for starting a multimillion-dollar foundation. He majored in English at Loyola College in Baltimore, then sold insurance to tobacco and corn farmers on Chesapeake Bay.</p>
        <p>The unexpected success in 1985 of Mr. Clancy's first novel, ''The Hunt for Red October,'' began a lucrative career that led to a string of best-selling novels and popular movies made from them.</p>
        <p>His financial empire grew to include more than a dozen businesses that have produced not only his major books like ''Patriot Games'' and ''Clear and Present Danger,'' but also video games, military manuals and serial novels written with others. He bought a share of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team and under his latest deal with Putnam Publishing, he earns $19 million for each novel completed, according to court records.</p>
        <p>Associates say Mr. Clancy's considerable fortune has attracted people with a host of causes and offbeat investment opportunities.</p>
        <p>''He was a very, very trusting man,'' said Diana Patin, Mr. Clancy's former longtime secretary. ''He accepted people as they put themselves to him.''</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990's, Mr. Clancy and his first wife, Wanda, lost $1.3 million to a coin dealer who is to be sentenced on Friday for defrauding them and dozens of other Maryland residents. In 1996, Mr. Clancy put $1 million into a company building a space vehicle that uses a propeller to land like a helicopter. The company has since scaled back its operations because of a lack of money.</p>
        <p>And, more recently, Mr. Clancy has helped a former Central Intelligence Agency operative turned cartoonist, Chip Beck, finance his investigation into whether the United States government had abandoned  some of its troops taken prisoner in wars fought in the 20th century. ''He gives people the chance to prove themselves,'' Mr. Beck said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clancy had become a fixture on the best-seller list by 1990 when Kyle caught his attention. The boy's grandfather had read him Mr. Clancy's first novel and then he ''just about memorized'' a video of the resulting movie, Mr. Clancy wrote in an essay encouraging others to befriend a sick child. ''Each of them, however ill, is alive and needful of the same things that we all need: love, friendship, conversation,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>One of his first acts after creating the Kyle Foundation was to hire Ms. Gorshow, whom he had met online in a discussion group run by America Online, where she  was a volunteer. He had a computer glitch; she had the solution.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gorshow had been a college instructor and school administrator, and she owned a mail-order bulk food distribution concern.</p>
        <p>In a chronology filed in Denver District Court, Ms. Gorshow described the foundation, in her first three years with it, as a shoestring operation run from her home in Oroville, Calif., and dogged by false starts. But by 1996, her starting salary of $43,000 had risen to $120,000, and fund-raising took off when Mr. Clancy signed a pledge to give $5 million in 10 installments, as well as the future Jack Ryan movie proceeds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clancy's enthusiasm for the project helped attract other big gifts, including $1 million from Viacom, and $750,000 from Lew Wasserman, the founder of MCA, and the MCA foundation. Aboard a 110-foot yacht off the coast of Vancouver, British Columbia, Mr. Clancy elicited $100,000 from John McCaw, cofounder of McCaw Cellular.</p>
        <p>While most of the money appears to have come from well-heeled friends, Mr. Clancy did use his fame to reach out to the public as well. In November 1997, he appeared on ''Jeopardy,'' where he announced he would donate his $10,000 consolation prize to the foundation.</p>
        <p>But there were bumps on the implementation side. As the foundation's executive director, Ms. Gorshow said she labored at a wide range of activities -- from securing an Internet address for the Web site to building a prototype database of information about pediatric oncology, which involved hiring college students to translate some foreign-language documents.</p>
        <p>One major endeavor turned into a dead end. The foundation had wanted to put computers in the homes and hospital rooms of sick children. Ms. Gorshow said she discovered other charities were trying to do the same thing, and that pilot projects turned up a concern: there was not enough time to teach very ill children how to use the Internet.</p>
        <p>Other aspects of the original concept fell by the wayside, including the notion of having cartoon characters answer questions from children. But even the basic mission -- building a one-stop directory to a million or so places to get health information -- began to seem elusive to the board.</p>
        <p>David R. Dukes, then the co-chairman of Ingram Micro, the nation's largest wholesale distributor of computers, said he became so convinced the foundation would not succeed that he resigned in mid-1997 rather than help it raise more money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukes said he told Mr. Clancy -- in person and later on the phone -- that with Ms. Gorshow as the foundation's leader, ''it became clear this thing would not be able to go forward the way that it ought to.''</p>
        <p>''But, back at the time,'' Mr. Dukes said,  ''I think, he was still very enamored with her, and I'm not sure he wanted to hear that.''</p>
        <p>Even Kyle's mother was mystified. She said the foundation did not respond to her e-mail messages inquiring about its progress and that it had become such a puzzle to her that she suggested that friends seeking to honor Kyle donate to other charities.</p>
        <p>Also, Mr. Clancy's personal life began intersecting with the foundation in unusual ways. When he ended a 1995 affair with a woman he met online, the Manhattan penthouse they had shared was cleared out by Ms. Gorshow and the foundation's director of operations, according to foundation records.</p>
        <p>Three years later, another woman he met online unsuccessfully sued him for breaking off their engagement. She then alerted Federal and state officials in California to possible mismanagement of foundation money, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Last summer, Mr. Clancy's new wife, Alexandra Llewellyn, began raising her own concerns about the foundation, prompting him to send her family's accountant to examine the books, an associate of Mr. Clancy said.</p>
        <p>The accountant delivered his report in February. Mr. Clancy, in his Feb. 24 letter to the board, listed some highlights: $636,628 spent on travel through 1998, $700,000 on consultants and $100,154 on a one-time payout last year to Ms. Gorshow for accrued vacation and sick pay.</p>
        <p>The foundation, the accountant discovered, had been fined $20,000 by the I.R.S. for tardy filing of its 1997 tax returns.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gorshow, in her letter to the board, defended the expenditures, saying the travel was legitimate and the vacation pay stemmed from concerns raised by the foundation's auditor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clancy asked a retired vice admiral, William McCauley, to assess whether it was worth putting more money into the Kyle Foundation. Admiral McCauley said he concluded that other medical Web sites had eclipsed Mr. Clancy's dream.</p>
        <p>''We got co-opted,'' Admiral McCauley said.</p>
        <p>Others disagree. In January, Sybase agreed to give the foundation its novel Web site portal program and the services of seven engineers to put it online, and as late as March the company was formulating a commitment it valued at $1 million a year for as long as a decade. At the same time, a design concern had come up with a foundation logo and was midway through its $500,000 commitment to create a Web site for the foundation.</p>
        <p>Internet venture experts say that despite the proliferation of medical information sites in recent years, the idea behind the Kyle Foundation remains not only viable, but potentially profitable as well. ''There is definitely need and demand for this type of project,'' said Deborah Buresh, a director at Shattuck Hammond Partners, the health care investment banking division of PricewaterhouseCoopers Securities.</p>
        <p>About $700,000 in foundation money remains, and Mr. Clancy has come up with a much simpler way to spend it. He now plans to endow a pediatric oncology research chair at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, to be named after Kyle.  Mr. Clancy entered into an agreement with Johns Hopkins that calls for him to add to that sum until it reaches $2 million over the next three years, the institution said.</p>
        <p>No future movie proceeds are involved.</p>
