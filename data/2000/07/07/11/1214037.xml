        <p>Branding the Olympics</p>
        <p>Here's a question that won't have harried fashion editors reaching for the Xanax: What will the United States athletes wear during medal ceremonies for the Summer Olympic Games, which begin Sept. 15 in Australia? The quick answer is warm-up suits by Adidas. But anyone tuned in to the drama of branding knows there are bigger issues here than a sporty silhouette.</p>
        <p>Back in the corporately innocent days of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, Michael Jordan made headlines by draping himself in an American flag during the medal ceremonies. Mr. Jordan wasn't being patriotic. He was safeguarding his brand. The uniforms worn by athletes to that year's ceremonies happened to be provided by Reebok. Mr. Jordan was a Nike shill.</p>
        <p>In the fallout over this logo skirmish, the United States Olympic Committee concluded that the time had come to abandon what one official at the time called  ''ambush marketing,'' with sponsors throwing money at athletes willy-nilly during Games years and then blowing out of town.</p>
        <p>The committee got serious about marketing the Games themselves as a brand, forming Olympic Properties of the United States, which last year signed a sports marketing firm, the International Management Group, to translate stirring gold medal moments into profits. Enter, among many others, Adidas.</p>
        <p>In New York this week to unveil the company's new medal outfits, Susan Halliday, an Adidas product manager, remarked that, in the past, ''you'd have a Coca-Cola do a year of the Games, and then they're gone.'' By contrast, Adidas, which has signed on for two years, ''is about long-term contracts and commitment,'' Ms. Halliday said. It's also, presumably, about a revived presence in a Nike-dominated market.</p>
        <p>Designed by Mireille Poujol, the asymmetric outfits have fitted jackets and stitched-on chevrons that converge to emphasize not only the medals but the athletes' physiques -- a novel idea. Formerly, Olympics sportswear came in unisex styles, Ms. Halliday said, ''which tended to be gaudy and flamboyant, with bells and whistles.''</p>
        <p>In Sydney, you won't be seeing any unseemly logo brouhaha. When American athletes show up for team processing, not only do they submit to random drug testing, they also sign waivers guaranteeing that, should they happen to medal, they will do so wearing the official sponsor's clothes.</p>
        <p>The Art of Shopping</p>
        <p>''I loved the idea of looking through the words to see the merch,'' said Barbara Kruger, the artist, taking a break yesterday during the installation of a career retrospective that opens at the Whitney Museum of American Art on Thursday. Ms. Kruger wasn't referring to anything in a gallery, however. She was talking about a display at Saks Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kruger, 55, was invited to install a series of her epigrammatic text-based images in the store's Fifth Avenue windows. Previous contributors have included Kenny Scharf, who installed green-skinned, one-eyed mannequins wearing John Bartlett camouflage leather, and William Wegman, who presented his long-suffering Weimaraners, Chip and Battina, decked out in Dolce &amp; Gabbana and wearing Donatella Versace-look-alike wigs.</p>
        <p>''We have an ongoing commitment to contemporary art,'' said Michael Macko, a Saks spokesman. Using fine artists in place of window dressers, he added, ''shows how fashion, art and design influence each other.'' It also incidentally honors a fine tradition. Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns all did windows, albeit at a hungrier stage in their careers.</p>
        <p>One can only conjecture how pedestrians will react to Ms. Kruger's work, which is probably as recognizable for its social critique as for its graphic oomph. In block letters dropped out of a signature red background, one text, for example, reads: ''You've got the look and you intend to keep it. You know how superficial an ornamental life can be, but at times you live one anyway.''</p>
        <p>It's a long way from fashion's traditionally loopy pronouncements: ''Banish the black; think pink!'' Or is it? The Saks project, Ms. Kruger explained, ''actually came out of a piece I did for Harper's Bazaar.''</p>
        <p>And it all ''originates in the fact that I worked at Conde Nast for 11 years,'' said Ms. Kruger, who was employed as a picture editor at House &amp; Garden and Mademoiselle. ''On a formal level, that's what my work came from: taking images and putting words across them. It's sort of fun to be on Fifth Avenue, with all this density of bodies and eyes, still taking images and putting words across them, but instead of 'Wear This Sweater' I'm using my own words.''</p>
