        <p>ICO-Teledesic Global Ltd., the satellite telecommunications venture controlled by Craig O. McCaw, said it had received commitments for nearly $300 million from a number of influential investors, including William H. Gates, chairman of Microsoft, and the private investment firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice Inc.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Gates is the most famous name, Clayton, Dubilier is the more important catch for Mr. McCaw. The New York investment company is putting up more money -- $150 million to Mr. Gates's $100 million. And it will provide experienced management help in the form of George W. Tamke, a partner who is the former co-chief executive of Emerson Electric.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tamke, who will join the ICO-Teledesic board, has been consulting with the company's management on a variety of operating and strategic issues for several months, according to Donald J. Gogel, Clayton, Dubilier's chief executive.</p>
        <p>''George will be doing a lot more than sitting and listening at board meetings,'' Mr. Gogel said.</p>
        <p>The investments, which are to be announced today, also give Clayton, Dubilier an option to invest $200 million more over the next two years.</p>
        <p>ICO-Teledesic is the holding company for ICO Global Communications and Teledesic L.L.C., a McCaw-led partnership. Teledesic, which was founded in 1994 by Mr. McCaw and Mr. Gates, has a long-range goal of creating a system of satellites to provide data and Internet services to computer users anywhere in the world. ICO Global, which planned a voice service for mobile users, went bankrupt last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaw organized a group of investors that brought ICO Global out of bankruptcy in May. His announced strategy is to merge the two satellite ventures, reshape ICO's capabilities to provide wireless data services in addition to voice and then use it as a steppingstone to the far more ambitious vision of Teledesic.</p>
        <p>ICO-Teledesic also plans to announce that Subhash Chandra, an entrepreneur from India, and Burtington Resources Inc., a private Swiss investment firm, are investing $65 million.</p>
        <p>Some $22.5 million represents Mr. Chandra's investment in the group that brought ICO Global out of bankruptcy. ICO-Teledesic will also confirm that Mr. McCaw's investment firm, Eagle River Investments L.L.C., provided $500 million of the $1.2 billion bankruptcy package.</p>
        <p>The investments will not be enough to carry ICO-Teledesic all the way through to early 2003, its projected start-up date. But the financial vote of confidence stood in stark contrast to financial and operating disappointments announced recently by satellite companies like Orbcomm Global and Globalstar Telecommunications.</p>
        <p>Orbcomm, which delivers messages to truckers and other mobile consumers, said late last month that it would lay off 112 employees and slow the construction of satellites. Globalstar, which offers voice and limited data services, defaulted last week on a $250 million line of bank credit.</p>
