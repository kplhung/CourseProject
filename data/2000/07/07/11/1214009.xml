        <p>People in their 30's and 40's sometimes find it hard to accept a doctor younger than they or younger than they are used to; some question clinical and life experience of younger doctors and are unprepared to take their advice; younger doctors can also trigger insecurities about age, mortality and achievements; photos (M)</p>

        <p>Sooner or later, people meet up with a jarring reminder that they are not as young as they think. Increasingly, the jolt hits middle-age types when a doctor walks through the door: he or she is not Marcus Welby, in keeping with the demographics of the medical profession.</p>
        <p>Of the 621,000 doctors practicing in hospitals or offices in 1998, the year for which the most recent data are available, almost half were under age 45, according to the American Medical Association. The greatest proportion -- about 189,108 -- were 35 to 44.</p>

        <p>Sooner or later, people meet up with a jarring reminder that they are not as young as they think. Increasingly, the jolt hits middle-age types when a doctor walks through the door: he or she is not Marcus Welby, in keeping with the demographics of the medical profession.</p>
        <p>Of the 621,000 doctors practicing in hospitals or offices in 1998, the year for which the most recent data are available, almost half were under age 45, according to the American Medical Association. The greatest proportion -- about 189,108 -- were 35 to 44.</p>
        <p>The shock of dealing with baby-faced doctors may not go beyond the reflexive brain flash ''They're so young!'' or the slightly terrified, ''She/he looks like a child!'' This is especially so when the doctor speaks with  authority, professionalism, experience and calmness.</p>
        <p>The patients of Dr. Valerie Asher, an ear, nose and throat specialist in a group practice in Silver Spring, Md., for example, say she exudes a confidence that belies her age, 39. ''It helps that I'm tall and I've been a bossy person my whole life,'' Dr. Asher said.</p>
        <p>It was that take-charge persona that Chris Dowd, 47, saw when doctor and patient met. ''She was a very succinct, efficient professional,'' said Mrs. Dowd, of Potomac, Md. ''There was never any question in my mind that she didn't know precisely what she was doing.''</p>
        <p>Even the fact that Dr. Asher, who took time off between her undergraduate and medical school years at Yale, has been in practice only since 1995 did not faze Mrs. Dowd or her 51-year-old husband, Dan, another patient. ''They established a nice rapport,'' Mrs. Dowd said.</p>
        <p>That is not uncommon, said Dr. Asher.  ''Most of the aging baby boomers I see are delighted,'' she said. ''They think that I'm ahead of the curve, compared to someone ahead of their generation.''</p>
        <p>But psychologists say that for many 40- and 50-year-olds that is not always the case. A younger doctor, psychologists say, can trigger insecurities about age, mortality, and achievements, as well as care-giving and advice-taking roles.</p>
        <p>Linda Loranger, 36, said she was uneasy last fall when she first saw her then 2-year-old daughter's new pediatrician, Dr. Karen Fratantoni, 29. ''She just looked really young,'' said Mrs. Loranger, a public relations specialist on maternity leave with her second child. ''At first, I was like, hmmmm. I questioned it.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Loranger, of Wheaton, Md., wanted to know why her daughter was having repeated, stubborn ear infections, but she was worried about Dr. Fratantoni's track record. Dr. Fratantoni, however, got to the bottom of the problem quickly, and Mrs. Loranger said she has been impressed since then.</p>
        <p>Mid-lifers may also question whether a 30-year-old doctor has enough clinical or life experience to relate to patients meaningfully. Ben Sapers, a 33-year-old primary-care doctor who completed his training last summer, said such concern reflects a dim understanding of medical education today.</p>
        <p>''By the time I finished my residency, I'd seen at least a dozen people die in front of me,'' said Dr. Sapers, of Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates in Boston.</p>
        <p>Holly Moss, 30, a specialist who helps children and families cope with hospital stays, has been practicing for five years. Ms. Moss counsels terminally ill children and their parents at Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City.</p>
        <p>Parents who meet her see a young woman, she said. ''At first they are skeptical,'' she said. ''But when I start talking about the issues and concerns, and anticipate the issues they will have, they become very receptive.''</p>
        <p>She also plays with the children, cajoling them with games, jokes, costumes -- whatever it takes. With some parents though, Ms. Moss said, that playful mode can undermine her authority, as when a set of parents decided she was not old enough to talk to their 14-year-old about another child's death.</p>
        <p>'' 'I just didn't think you had it in you, and I didn't trust you because you seemed so young, and you don't have your own children,' '' Ms. Moss recalled the mother saying.</p>
        <p>Some people are unprepared to take advice from a younger person, said Dr. Nancy  K. Schlossberg, a psychologist and professor emeritus at the University of Maryland who has written several books about coping with change. ''We are used to taking care of younger people, not having younger people take care of us,'' Dr. Schlossberg said.</p>
        <p>The comfort level may be higher with a younger surgeon, who is perceived as having steadier hands and more familiarity with the latest techniques. But it may lessen when the problem is more personal. A 50-year-old might not feel comfortable, for example, discussing sexual dysfunction with a 32-year-old, Dr. Schlossberg said.</p>
        <p>Older doctors are generally better at reading patients' emotional concerns, said Dr. Zeev E. Neuwirth, a family therapist and medical educator at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. But, said Dr. Neuwirth, himself a relatively young doctor at 38, most newly minted physicians have razor-sharp technical skills and a solid grounding in relating to their patients.</p>
        <p>And, Mrs. Dowd said, youth does not always mean inexperience. ''It kind of gets my back up when people say you are too young to know what you're talking about.''</p>
