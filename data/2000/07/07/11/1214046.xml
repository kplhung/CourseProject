        <p>GERMANY: IRANIANS PROTEST  Thousands of Iranians in exile demonstrated in Berlin against the start of a three-day state visit by President Mohammad Khatami. The police arrested scattered protesters after detaining dozens of opponents of the Tehran government during overnight searches of local residences. Security is high during Mr. Khatami's visit, the first by an Iranian leader since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Critics had urged Germany to withdraw the invitation because of Iran's poor rights record.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: MORE MAD COW DISEASE  Officials have found another three cases of mad cow disease, bringing the total this year to 26. The new outbreaks virtually assure that authorities will discover far more cases this year than they did last year, when 31 cases were recorded. Officials had hoped to see the number of cases declining by now. A testing program that started last month is likely to increase the number of cases even further, officials have warned.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: LATVIA ACCUSED  Russia accused Latvia of ''blatantly inhuman'' behavior after a court ordered an 87-year-old Russian veteran imprisoned for two years for World War II crimes against humanity. The former Soviet K.G.B. official was convicted of persecuting dozens of people, nine of whom were condemned to death. Russia has long accused Latvia, its former satellite, of discriminating against ethnic Russians.</p>

        <p>HONG KONG: ELITE VOTERS  An elite group of voters elected 800 people, including Hong Kong's wealthiest man, Li Ka-shing, to be on a committee charged with selecting future lawmakers. Critics called the election undemocratic. Only 177,000 of Hong Kong's 3.1 million registered voters were eligible to choose the election committee, which will select six of the lawmakers for a 60-seat legislature, only 24 of whom will be popularly elected.</p>
