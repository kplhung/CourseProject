        <p>The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, a new conglomerate that controls Airbus Industrie, received a chilly response from investors today in its long-awaited initial stock offering.</p>
        <p>Shares of the company, known as EADS, had already been discounted by underwriters as a result of lower-than-expected demand. Today, they dropped about 10 percent from an opening price of 19 euros, or $18.14, to closes on the Frankfurt, Paris and Madrid exchanges of 17.2 euros, 17.5 euros and 17 euros, respectively.</p>
        <p>The lackluster response was a sharp contrast to investors' appetite for some other prominent initial stock offerings, including Infineon, a computer chip manufacturer spun off by Siemens, and T-Online, the Internet subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. Such offerings were heavily oversubscribed, Infineon by 30 times the number of shares being sold, and rose significantly from their opening prices.</p>
        <p>The lack of investor enthusiasm -- though hardly devastating for EADS, the world's third-largest aerospace company after Boeing and Lockheed Martin -- cast a pall over its flagship project: a $12 billion plan to build a superjumbo jet, the A3XX, that is intended to eclipse the Boeing 747.</p>
        <p>Most of the nearly $3 billion raised by today's stock offering will be pumped into the A3XX, a flying mammoth with room for 550 seats and amenities like a restaurant, bedrooms or children's play area.</p>
        <p>Based on the original goal of EADS to raise 3.5 billion euros, or about $3.3 billion, analysts had predicted that the shares would be offered at a price of 22 to 24 euros. But underwriters reduced their estimate to 20 euros by the end of last week and on Sunday settled at prices of 19 euros for institutional investors and 18 for individual investors.</p>
        <p>Some analysts said the feeble market response had less to do with worries about the A3XX or with the company itself than with concerns about a cyclical downturn in the civilian aircraft industry.</p>
        <p>Both Airbus, in which EADS holds 80 percent ownership, and Boeing have had surges in orders in the last few years, and Airbus has climbed from a distant second in new orders to a virtual tie with Boeing -- long the world leader in passenger aircraft-building.</p>
        <p>The fear is that the pace of orders will inevitably taper off from current levels, and investors do not want to buy shares if the industry is about to enter a sluggish period. ''Clearly, we are much nearer the top of the cycle than the bottom, and this is a deeply cyclical industry,'' said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London. ''There has to be a correction. The real issue is how deep of a correction and what the effects will be on the different players.''</p>
        <p>Other analysts said investors remained worried about the complex ownership of EADS. Reflecting the composition of the Airbus consortium, EADS is the product of a merger between Aerospatiale Matra of France, the DASA unit of DaimlerChrysler and Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain. It is carefully balanced between French and German co-chief executives and also has an awkward relationship with British Aerospace, which is not part of EADS but owns 20 percent of Airbus.</p>
        <p>Adding to the complexity, the French government also holds a 20 percent stake in EADS. That has raised some concern that the company could fall victim to politicized decision-making. ''It is a difficult company, difficult to manage and difficult to squeeze out synergies,'' said Klaus Martini, head of European equities at DWS, the Deutsche Bank mutual fund arm. ''You have to deal with a lot of different parties with a lot of different interests.''</p>
        <p>Risks associated with the A3XX have also played into the worries. After years of study, Airbus executives announced two weeks ago that they would proceed with plans to build the huge new aircraft.</p>
        <p>Boeing, by contrast, has argued for years that there is little real demand for a larger new class of jumbo jet. Boeing now seems to be hedging its bets with plans to develop a stretched version of the 1970's-design 747. Though it may not be as innovative as the A3XX, the stretch 747 would be far cheaper to develop.</p>
        <p>Philippe Camus, one of the two co-chief executives of EADS along with Rainer Hertrich of Germany, responded stoically to the difficulties that confronted today's public offering. ''You must be humble with the market,'' he said in Paris. ''The market indicated to us the price it was ready to pay. End of story.''</p>
