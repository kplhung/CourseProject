        <p>West Nile virus, the mosquito-borne illness that for a year has scared people in and around New York, is harder to detect than generally realized, researchers say.</p>
        <p>A report in the current issue of Neurology urged greater vigilance in diagnosing the disease, citing two patients who exhibited unusual symptoms and so were found to have the disease only after a delay.</p>
        <p>In one case, a 69-year-old Long Island man was given a misdiagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome after entering a hospital and reporting progressive weakness. West Nile was not diagnosed for several weeks, and by then he was severely paralyzed and on a respirator.</p>
        <p>In a second case, a healthy 15-year-old boy was hospitalized after three days of fever, headache, vomiting and confusion, the journal said. Although he did not show symptoms of West Nile, spinal fluid and blood tests later showed he had the disease. The boy eventually recovered.</p>
        <p>Although there is no specific treatment for the disease, doctors who are aware that a patient has it can take measures to reduce its harm.</p>
        <p>Last year, 7 people died of the disease in the New York region, and 62 were made ill. This year, no cases have been confirmed.</p>
        <p>In an interview, one of the authors, Dr. Charles A. Nichter of Columbia and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, said that alerting doctors to the difficulties of diagnosing West Nile would not only help them treat patients but would also let health officials get a better handle on the extent of the outbreak.</p>
