        <p>The increasing likelihood that a 73-year-old former prime minister will go to prison for remarks in a political speech six years ago is sending a chill through Turkey's political elite and bringing widespread calls to relax laws that restrict freedom of speech.</p>
        <p>An appeals court last week upheld the one-year sentence and lifetime political ban imposed on former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on the charge of ''provoking hatred'' in a 1994 speech. Since the ruling, political leaders have scrambled to diminish the decision's impact on Turkey's efforts to portray itself as a modern democracy and to join the European Union. Even Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said he was saddened at the prospect of Mr. Erbakan going to prison.</p>

        <p>The increasing likelihood that a 73-year-old former prime minister will go to prison for remarks in a political speech six years ago is sending a chill through Turkey's political elite and bringing widespread calls to relax laws that restrict freedom of speech.</p>
        <p>An appeals court last week upheld the one-year sentence and lifetime political ban imposed on former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on the charge of ''provoking hatred'' in a 1994 speech. Since the ruling, political leaders have scrambled to diminish the decision's impact on Turkey's efforts to portray itself as a modern democracy and to join the European Union. Even Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said he was saddened at the prospect of Mr. Erbakan going to prison.</p>
        <p>Whether the concerns translate into a genuine overhaul of laws regarded outside Turkey as violations of free expression is unclear.</p>
        <p>Leaders across the political spectrum indicated that it may be time to modify elements of the code that make it a crime to promote religious or ethnic differences and to criticize the government or military.</p>
        <p>Some in the influential military and the politicians most strongly wedded to Turkey's secularist state still oppose change, however, for fear Turkey will turn more toward Islam.</p>
        <p>A leader of the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party told Mr. Ecevit last week that the organization would consider supporting changes to the criminal code in exchange for leniency for Mr. Erbakan, according to the Turkish press. Backing for revisions also came from parties that form Mr. Ecevit's coalition.</p>
        <p>''We have to make radical improvements to the civil and criminal codes,'' Bulent Akarcali, a member of Parliament who is deputy chairman of the Motherland Party, one of the coalition members, said in an interview. ''It is a must.''</p>
        <p>Gunduz Aktan, a former senior Turkish diplomat, said laws categorized in the criminal code as ''crimes against the state'' need to be revised to recognize the difference between legitimate political speech or criticism of government and threats. ''We need to separate violence and threats to public order from legitimate free speech,'' Mr. Aktan, a former ambassador to Greece and Japan, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Mr. Erbakan was prime minister for a year in 1996 and 1997. He resigned under pressure from the military and political opponents who said that he was plotting against the secular order of Turkey. His pro-Islamic party was outlawed, but later re-emerged as the Virtue Party, with most of the same leaders.</p>
        <p>Last March, Mr. Erbakan was convicted of a crime against the state for a speech he made in a Kurdish-dominated area before he became prime minister. In the speech, he contended that Turkey had abandoned its Islamic roots and that secular politicians had divided the Kurds from other Turks.</p>
        <p>''In this country there are two parties: the righteous and the fallacious,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Erbakan's jail sentence and ban were upheld by the appeals court, and he is expected to serve about five months in prison unless the chief prosecutor's office recommends reducing the sentence.</p>
        <p>A report drafted by the Council of Europe said the Turkish government needs to improve human rights and change portions of its law that are undemocratic, including various restrictions on free speech. The report said Turkey needs to make these changes if it hopes to achieve its goal of gaining membership in the European Union.</p>
        <p>Seyfi Tashan, director of the Foreign Policy Institute in Ankara, noted that the threats that validated the restrictions on speech for many Turks appear to have eased. Kurdish separatism is less threatening and concern over Islamic fundamentalism may also be diminishing, he said.</p>
        <p>''The question is whether the perception of threats has decreased to the point where free expression can be condoned,'' Mr. Tashan said.</p>
        <p>But others argue that the Islamic threat is still too potent to warrant easing restrictions. ''There is no such thing as mild Islam,'' said Suna Kili, an author and political science professor at Bosporus University. ''The republic has the right to protect itself. Even in France and Germany there are laws protecting the secular state.''</p>
        <p>The strictness of the laws was demonstrated last week when a prosecutor increased charges against Nadire Mater, a Turkish journalist who wrote a book last year recounting stories of soldiers who fought the Kurds in southeast Turkey. The prosecutor said the author would face two 2 to 12 years in prison if convicted of insulting the military.</p>
