        <p>The future of the stalled International Space Station could hinge on a star.</p>
        <p>Construction of what is to become the largest structure that humans have ever put into space has been on hold, awaiting the late arrival of the station's critical Russian-made command and living section.</p>
        <p>The long-overdue service module, called Zvezda, which means ''star'' in Russian, is to rocket into orbit tomorrow and put an end to the hiatus of almost two years in building what is to become a sprawling international research complex in space.</p>
        <p>Experts say that successfully launching Zvezda is one of the most critical steps in the $60 billion project, for both engineering and political reasons. The rest of the station, which could take another five years to finish, cannot be built without this pivotal piece in place. And loss of this module in a launching accident, which would further delay construction and drive up costs, could mean political death for the project, some say.</p>
        <p>Zvezda, the primary Russian contribution to the space station, is to be launched atop a three-stage Proton rocket at 12:56 a.m. Eastern time tomorrow from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. After two weeks of orbital maneuvers and equipment checks, the service module is to dock with the budding space station on July 25.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the most critical pieces of the International Space Station,'' said James E. Oberg of Houston, an expert on the Russian space program and a former engineer with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Zvezda is the first in a string of one-of-a-kind space station sections for which there are no backups if something goes wrong, Mr. Oberg said, and is perhaps the most crucial of these because Zvezda is to control the whole station and keep it in space during the early stages of construction.</p>
        <p>''It would probably take at least three years for Zvezda to be replaced,'' Mr. Oberg said. ''This is the first of a series of things that really can't go wrong if the project is to stay on track.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Oberg noted, however, that he was confident that the launching of Zvezda and its mating with the current two components of the station would be successful, even if initial problems occurred. ''This has been very well planned and the Russians know what they are doing,'' he said, ''There are many layers of fallback procedures and redundant systems that give me some confidence it will work.''</p>
        <p>The International Space Station is the work of 16 nations, led by the United States. The partners, including members of the European Space Agency and Canada, Japan, Brazil and Russia, have already spent billions of dollars building more than 300,000 pounds of equipment for the station, which ultimately is to weigh almost a million pounds and, with its huge solar power panels, span an area the size of two football fields.</p>
        <p>The 42,000-pound service module originally was scheduled to be launched in April 1998, but lack of money prevented the Russian Space Agency from finishing it on time. With support from NASA, which bought equipment and services from the Russians, the module was slowly completed. But the project dragged on, causing tension between the United States and Russia because the Russians continued to spend their scarce resources on their aging Mir space station at the expense of the international program.</p>
        <p>The service module was almost ready to fly last fall when a series of failures with the normally reliable Proton rocket caused more delays. NASA insisted this spring that Russia correct the rocket problems and launch Zvezda by this summer, or the agency would launch an American interim control module and continue space station construction without waiting for the Russians.</p>
        <p>Marcia S. Smith, a space policy analyst for the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress, said that getting Zvezda off the ground would be an important step in soothing tensions in the space station coalition. ''It's a very significant launch in terms of the relationships of the partners in the project,'' Ms. Smith said, ''particularly the United States and Russia, and to construction of the space station itself.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith said that a loss of the service module would cause substantial delays in building the space station and drive up costs, but it would not necessarily kill the project. ''A lot of people say it would be catastrophic if it fails, but I wouldn't go that far,'' she said. ''There are a number of contingency and backup plans that could be implemented to continue the project.''</p>
        <p>Both Russian and American space officials are optimistic that the worst is over and space station construction can proceed rapidly once Zvezda is in place. ''There have been some struggles, but it's very exciting to see it coming together,'' said Mark Geyer, NASA's manager for station integration.</p>
        <p>Zvezda will not only provide living quarters for the initial crews to run the station, it also will command the station's position in space and control all electrical, computer, communications and flight systems for the complex. Astronauts will use it for housing and for conducting some research, but Zvezda will also be the base for spacewalks needed for maintenance and accelerating station construction.</p>
        <p>One American and two Russian astronauts are set to take up residence in November as ''Expedition 1,'' the first crew beginning permanent occupation of the station.</p>
        <p>Michael Baker, director of NASA operations in Russia, said at a briefing on Friday in Moscow that Zvezda was ''the beginning of the real assembly of the International Space Station, with 15 launches scheduled in the next calendar year.'' Officials said that during the eight American space shuttle flights, and Russian missions involving two Soyuz craft with crews and five Progress cargo ships, the station would receive expanded solar power arrays, stabilizing gyroscopes, an American science laboratory and tons of fuel and supplies for growth.</p>
        <p>Officials at the briefing said that two flights since early June of the modified Proton rocket that would carry Zvezda had been successful, including one on July 5 that had what they called a minor malfunction in its second stage. Sergei Shayevich, a senior manager at the Khrunichev State Research and Production Center, which makes the rocket, said a drop in chamber pressure in the rocket stage at the end of its operation was unlikely to affect the Zvezda launching.</p>
        <p>The $340 million Zvezda, the first station module fully financed by Russia, will join two existing modules, together weighing 70,000 pounds, that have made up the fledgling station for more than a year and a half. The Zarya control module, made in Russia with American financing, was the first part of the space station. The Zarya module was launched in November 1998, and it was followed in December by the American Unity connecting node. American shuttles have visited the complex twice since then to bring supplies, perform maintenance and increase the station's altitude, which slowly decreases because of atmospheric drag even when 240 miles up.</p>
        <p>Zvezda is a large module that looks like the core unit of the Mir space station launched in 1986, but Zvezda has many upgrades, said Kirk Shireman, NASA's manager for Russian elements to the space station.</p>
        <p>''The computer system is the biggest difference,'' Mr. Shireman said. The system, made by a German company and provided by the European Space Agency, is more up to date than those used in other parts of the station, but is compatible with them, he said.</p>
        <p>The service module also has new guidance, communications and monitoring systems, as well as upgraded navigation, control, guidance and ventilation equipment. As well, Russia has improved the safety and operation of the oxygen-generating candles it uses as a backup air supply, Mr. Shireman said. Use of such candles caused a fire aboard Mir in 1997.</p>
        <p>The 43-foot-long Zvezda, about the size of a city bus, has a docking node on one end to join with other spacecraft or sections, and a propulsion unit on the other. The pressurized interior has a command center for controlling the station, and a center living area with sleeping quarters, a toilet, a kitchen with a refrigerator-freezer, a table for meals, and exercise equipment like a treadmill and a stationary bicycle.</p>
        <p>The unit, which has 14 small windows distributed throughout, could serve as a self-sustained space station by itself, drawing electrical power from two solar wings that span 95.5 feet.</p>
        <p>Getting Zvezda and the other units together will not be simple. Normally, it takes two days for a spacecraft to rendezvous and dock with the station, but the service module's journey is scheduled to take two weeks. Program managers said the leisurely schedule for mating the modules is designed to let controllers thoroughly check out the unit before the critical docking.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the launching, Zvezda's antennas and solar arrays will be deployed, and guidance, navigation and control systems will be activated. After testing sensors and engines, the craft will conduct two major engine firings to take it to the space station's altitude. During the next 10 days, controllers will check power and communication systems, and test the Kurs automatic docking systems that are to guide the craft together. Some days have no scheduled activities and have been left open to allow time to repair any problems that arise, officials said.</p>
        <p>Docking is to occur on the 15th day of the mission and is timed to occur over Russian ground stations so that controllers can monitor the robotic mating. Zvezda will be the passive partner in the maneuvering and docking, holding its position while the space station slowly closes in. The Kurs system on each module will constantly send signals to the other to guide the speed, position and direction of the units as they close.</p>
        <p>After the units dock and locking clamps secure them, the space in between will be pressurized and there will be three days of leak testing. When the linkup is confirmed as permanent, Zvezda's computers are to take control of the complex and deactivate control systems previously used by the station, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mark Ferring, the lead space station flight director at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said there should be fuel aboard the space station for two, and possibly three, docking attempts. If something goes wrong and the mating cannot be done automatically, he said, the Russians have emergency plans to launch two astronauts to Zvezda to conduct a manual docking.</p>
        <p>Two astronauts, Gennady Padalka and Nikolai Budarin, have been trained as ''Expedition Zero,'' a crew that would be launched in a Soyuz craft on Aug. 10 to dock with the service module. The crew would enter Zvezda and assemble a remote-control rendezvous system called TORU, which was designed to let them control the space station sitting some distance away from the service module. Two days later, the astronauts would use TORU to guide the space station toward Zvezda for a linkup. After spending 10 more days or so aboard the service module activating some systems, the crew would return to Earth.</p>
        <p>Space station assembly would resume with the launching of the shuttle Atlantis on Sept. 8, bringing supplies to outfit it for the first resident crew and a team of spacewalking astronauts to complete outside connections of the newly expanded orbiting outpost.</p>
