        <p>The games in Guatemala next Sunday and Costa Rica a week later may determine whether the United States qualifies for the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea. The Americans convened in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., yesterday to prepare for the first two World Cup qualifying games on the road before they return home to play Barbados Aug. 16 at Foxboro Stadium outside Boston.</p>
        <p>Home games will follow against Guatemala (Sept. 3 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington) and Costa Rica (Oct. 11 at Columbus Crew Stadium in Columbus, Ohio). The Americans will complete the qualifying round with a game Nov. 15 in Barbados, the weakest team in the group.</p>

        <p>The games in Guatemala next Sunday and Costa Rica a week later may determine whether the United States qualifies for the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea. The Americans convened in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., yesterday to prepare for the first two World Cup qualifying games on the road before they return home to play Barbados Aug. 16 at Foxboro Stadium outside Boston.</p>
        <p>Home games will follow against Guatemala (Sept. 3 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington) and Costa Rica (Oct. 11 at Columbus Crew Stadium in Columbus, Ohio). The Americans will complete the qualifying round with a game Nov. 15 in Barbados, the weakest team in the group.</p>
        <p>Tab Ramos of the MetroStars is expected to play for the the national team for first time since the embarrassing loss to Iran in the 1998 World Cup in France. After the Americans finished last among the 32 nations in France, Ramos was outspoken in his criticism of Steve Sampson, then coach of the Americans.</p>
        <p>Bruce Arena, the present coach, recalled Ramos after the midfielder's excellent performances in leading the MetroStars to first place in the Eastern Division of Major League Soccer. The 33-year-old Ramos was also tapped for his vast experience playing in tough conditions abroad.</p>
        <p>Ramos scored his first goal for the United States national team against Costa Rica in 1989 in qualifying for the 1990 World Cup. He also had a spectacular goal against Costa Rica in 1997, for the 1998 World Cup.</p>
        <p>Clint Mathis of the MetroStars and Greg Vanney of the Los Angeles Galaxy were also named to the 18-man roster, replacing the injured Ben Olsen and Jeff Agoos, both of D.C. United.</p>
        <p>Mathis has been one of the hottest strikers in M.L.S. in recent weeks. Since joining the Metro- Stars from Los Angeles, Mathis has six goals, including the only one in last Saturday's 1-0 triumph in Kansas City that put the MetroStars 9 points ahead of New England.</p>
        <p>METROSTARS</p>
        <p>The MetroStars reached the top of their division without Lothar MatthAus, who has not returned to the United States. Matthaus was supposed to join the team on Sunday after visiting his personal doctor in Germany regarding spasms in his lower back.</p>
        <p>Nick Sakiewicz, the general manager of the MetroStars, said yesterday that Matthaus's failure to return on Sunday was not significant because the team did not not practice that day or yesterday. Matthaus is not scheduled to play in tonight's exhibition game on Long Island against the Rough Riders.</p>
        <p>''I expect him to be with the team Wednesday,'' Sakiewicz said. ''I've planned a meeting with him Wednesday night. Right now, he is not my main concern. My team is doing well and I have a million other things to plan for the 2001 season.''</p>
        <p>Tim Howard's goalkeeping has certainly contributed to the success of the MetroStars. Howard's shutout victory in Kansas City was his third in the last four games. The 21-year-old native of North Brunswick, N.J., has allowed one goal in 370 minutes of action in the league this season.</p>
        <p>ZIMBABWE</p>
        <p>The death toll in Zimbabwe rose to 13 yesterday and the country's health minister blamed the police and Zimbabwe's governing body of soccer for the incident in which the police fired tear gas at fans throwing bottles, leading to a stampede and the interruption of the World Cup qualifier against South Africa at National Sports Stadium in Harare.</p>
        <p>The state television station reported that the dead included five women, four men and three boys. Seven people remained hospitalized, four in critical condition.</p>
        <p>''It was an accident which should have been avoided,'' the health minister, Timothy Stamps, told the station yesterday. ''The police reacted far too extensively. I also blame the organizers because that stadium has problems with the exits, which are too small.''</p>
        <p>Before a crowd of more than 50,000, South Africa had a 2-0 lead when the game was stopped with eight minutes left. Andreas Herren, a FIFA spokesman, said yesterday that FIFA was investigating the matter and a final decision on the game's outcome had not been made. FIFA's options include declaring South Africa the winner or ordering a replay of the game.</p>
        <p>The incident came three days after South Africa missed out on being selected as the host nation for the 2006 World Cup. Germany got the tournament vote by a 12-11 margin.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>Louis van Gaal, a former coach of Barcelona, has been named coach of the national team of the Netherlands, replacing Frank Riijkaard, who resigned last week after the loss to Italy in the semifinals of the European Championship. ... The former Manchester United midfielder Jordi Cruyff joined Alaves in Spain yesterday on a free transfer. ... The Euro 2000 Web site received more than a billion hits during last month's tournament, the company running the site announced yesterday. The record for a day was set June 12, when Germany played Romania and England met Portugal. ... One of Greece's national players playing abroad has returned home. Vassilis Tsartas was purchased from Sevilla of Spain by A.E.K. of Athens for a club record $6.35 million. Tsartas was a member of A.E.K. when it captured consecutive championships from 1992 to 1994. ... The game between Mexico and Slovakia scheduled for last Sunday in Los Angeles was canceled. Organizers said the Slovak team did not arrive for the game and no replacement could be found.</p>
