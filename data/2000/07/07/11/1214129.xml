        <p>George Steinbrenner says the Mets are a very good team. He also wonders if they are pretty good at spinning a story.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' principal owner suggested yesterday that the Mets had harped on the beaning of Mike Piazza and a contested umpire's call over the weekend to draw attention away from the fact that they lost four of six games in the Subway Series this year.</p>
        <p>''The big point of the series is that the Yankees won the series, in pretty convincing fashion,'' Steinbrenner said in a telephone interview. ''But I don't blame Bobby Valentine and the Mets for doing what they did. They had to take the focus off the fact that they got their fannies handed to them this time -- this time -- and they are a great team. I'm not sure it wasn't a very wise public relations move for them to take the focus off the way they were beaten.</p>
        <p>''I think Bobby Valentine and his people would love to take the focus off of that, and have the people forget about the results. It would probably be the same for us, if we lost. I'd probably be trying to think about what I would do. I don't blame him for what he's doing.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' director of media relations, Jay Horwitz, declined to comment on Steinbrenner's remarks, or to reach Valentine, the Mets' manager, for comment.</p>
        <p>As Steinbrenner spoke yesterday, his general manager, Brian Cashman, was sorting through possible options to replace left fielder Shane Spencer, who blew out his knee Sunday and will miss the rest of the season. The Yankees might make a deal for an established major leaguer before the July 31 trade deadline, but for now, Cashman said that Ryan Thompson, a former Met, would most likely be promoted from Class AAA Columbus. Thompson was told after Columbus's game last night that he was headed for New York.</p>
        <p>Thompson, 32, is hitting .296 with 20 home runs and 58 runs batted in in 247 at-bats for the Clippers, including 11 home runs since June 20. He has been playing center field for the Clippers, and would become the backup to Bernie Williams in center, in addition to the playing time he would get in left field and as a right-handed designated hitter.</p>
        <p>The Yankees may also use Chuck Knoblauch as the designated hitter on some days, with Jose Vizcaino starting at second base.</p>
        <p>The Yankees and the Mets split two games played at Yankee Stadium last month, and the Yankees won the first three games of the four games over the weekend. But Roger Clemens's beaning of Piazza in the second inning on Saturday night, which left Piazza with a concussion and unavailable to play Sunday or in tonight's All-Star Game, dominated the talk.</p>
        <p>Piazza addressed the news media before Sunday's game and said he believed Clemens threw at him intentionally -- as Valentine and other members of the Mets organization maintained angrily on Saturday, when Piazza was being examined at a hospital. Valentine was also incensed by a rare interference call made against the Mets in the first inning of the first game of Saturday's two-borough doubleheader, arguing until he was ejected and then protesting the game.</p>
        <p>''Bobby Valentine is a good manager,'' Steinbrenner said. ''He's also a smart P.R. guy. He knows there were rumors about his position, and he came in looking for a big series. I'm sure they were just a little frustrated, and the frustration all caught up with him.</p>
        <p>''They have a very, very fine team, but so do we. They came in really looking to try to prove something to us, and the facts of the matter are it didn't happen. We won the city championship, if that means anything. We won four out of six games, and that's pretty convincing, especially against a team as good as they are.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner said he was sure Clemens did not try to injure Piazza. ''The fastball pitchers, they have to live inside,'' Steinbrenner said. ''Look at Pedro Martinez -- he's hit 11 men this year, almost twice as many as Roger. Roger lives inside. But to say he intentionally threw at him -- no way. I know Roger, I know he's a family guy who loves his kids, and there's no way a future Hall of Famer like him is going to try to hurt somebody.</p>
        <p>''Mike Piazza is one of the best players in the history of the game. We're sorry for Mike; we're sorry it happened. Now let's get the focus back on the games. I'm sorry this happened. It took away from the real results of what happened. If they don't get over this, I feel sorry for them.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner reiterated one of his mantras from last year, that playing two series against the Mets each season is too much. ''It's great for the spectators, so from that standpoint it's fine,'' he said. ''But it creates undue stress on the two teams, especially in New York. There are certain of these so-called rivalries that create so much attention that it's almost like the World Series. It just creates a real hardship on the managers, on the teams, the players, and that's who I feel for.''</p>
        <p>Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, would not allow the Yankees to use the Mets' workout room at Shea Stadium Sunday because it is part of the Mets' clubhouse and Phillips said he wanted to eliminate the chance of confrontation. Folks in baseball have long memories, Phillips said.</p>
        <p>''We have long memories, too,'' said Steinbrenner, who did not disagree with Phillips's decision about the workout room. ''I think some of it might have been frustration on Phillips's part. I think that they pointed to this series more than possibly we did. We had not been playing good baseball coming into this series, and they had two or three great pitchers ready to go against us. We had been in some disarray, and we pulled together for this. They had to be somewhat frustrated.</p>
        <p>''Nobody would take that easy. Nobody. I'm a poor loser, and I don't know how I would react.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>RAMIRO MENDOZA, on the 15-day disabled list with arm stiffness, threw off flat ground at Yankee Stadium yesterday and reported no problems. The Yankees hope Mendoza will be ready to come off the disabled list sometime next week, and if all goes well with the current rotation, Mendoza probably will go back to the bullpen. ORLANDO HERNANDEZ, ROGER CLEMENS, ANDY PETTITTE, DAVID CONE and DWIGHT GOODEN will pitch the first five games after the All-Star Game break, in that order, all at home.</p>
