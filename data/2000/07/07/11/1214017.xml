        <p>TUFF  By Paul Beatty  259 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $23.</p>
        <p>The eponymous Tuff of Paul Beatty's new novel is a smart small-time hoodlum from the streets of East Harlem who sees things as they are and whose dreams that they might be different smash up against the jagged edges of reality. He is 19, married and the father of a small boy, and he is surrounded by a cast of characters who, like Tuff himself, are outside the usual categories.</p>
        <p>His best friend is a disabled anti-Semitic black Muslim who is always coming up with get-rich schemes, legal and otherwise. His father is a cant-spouting former Black Panther who begins poetry readings by firing shotgun shells into the auditorium ceiling. His self-appointed mentor is a black rabbi named Spencer Throckmorton, who converted to Judaism to marry his college sweetheart and became a rabbi even though she later left him. Tuff, whose real name is Winston Foshay, decides about midway through Mr. Beatty's satirical ghetto romp to run for city council, raising money by working in a three-card monte scam in midtown Manhattan.</p>

        <p>TUFF  By Paul Beatty  259 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $23.</p>
        <p>The eponymous Tuff of Paul Beatty's new novel is a smart small-time hoodlum from the streets of East Harlem who sees things as they are and whose dreams that they might be different smash up against the jagged edges of reality. He is 19, married and the father of a small boy, and he is surrounded by a cast of characters who, like Tuff himself, are outside the usual categories.</p>
        <p>His best friend is a disabled anti-Semitic black Muslim who is always coming up with get-rich schemes, legal and otherwise. His father is a cant-spouting former Black Panther who begins poetry readings by firing shotgun shells into the auditorium ceiling. His self-appointed mentor is a black rabbi named Spencer Throckmorton, who converted to Judaism to marry his college sweetheart and became a rabbi even though she later left him. Tuff, whose real name is Winston Foshay, decides about midway through Mr. Beatty's satirical ghetto romp to run for city council, raising money by working in a three-card monte scam in midtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''Tuff,'' in other words, is an extravagant, satirical cri de coeur from the inner city, centering on that most common of all sociological concepts, the young black urban male, which is Mr. Beatty's principal literary subject. This gifted writer's first novel, ''The White Boy Shuffle,'' was about one Gunnar Kaufman, who in moving from middle-class Santa Monica to meaner, grittier Hillside, Calif., has to learn to handle himself in the urban arena. Mr. Beatty's new book shifts the scene from Los Angeles to New York, and from a neophyte home boy to a native son, but it stays within the genre of comic parody, with its poison darts aimed both at the black urban male himself and the sociologists who have conceptualized him.</p>
        <p>''Tuff'' is a funny book, and Mr. Beatty's blunt, impious, streetwise eloquence has a kind of transfixing power. The serious point, though never put in serious political-science language by Mr. Beatty, would seem to be the subtle power of the inner city trap, with Winston and his friends hemmed in by stiff-necked victim-culture ideologues in one corner,  self-defeating in-group machismo in another and an indifferent economic system in the third.</p>
        <p>The main ingredient of ''Tuff'' is portraiture, word-rich, profanity- and caricature-drenched tableaus of Winston and the off-kilter world in which he dwells. Skillfully drawn as those tableaus are, one yearns for Mr. Beatty to advance beyond his absurdist color photos of Winston's world, to do something more than slash our conventional notions into scraps.</p>
        <p>Advance to what exactly is difficult to say. Maybe something deeper and more affecting than Winston's  insouciant, self-defeating confrontation with the limitations of his world. Mr. Beatty's genre-busting technique, his mingling of parody with naturalism, seems aimed at avoiding stock situations, ghetto stereotypes.  His book is a kind of anti-''Shaft'' in this sense, and that is most welcome. But his unwillingness to shed the transgressive comic mode also subjects his narrative to a talky, meandering quality and a tendency to end up not in ghetto stereotypes but in ghetto slapstick.</p>
        <p>We first meet Winston waking up from a faint in a Brooklyn tenement that has just been the scene of some drug-gang murders. That Winston fainted, and that his childhood memories are of being teased because of his bulk, lead the reader into mistaking him for a hapless figure, too flabby for the mean streets. In fact Winston is fat but far from hapless. He casually steps around the corpses, joins up with his best friend, whose name is Fariq, and heads toward East Harlem, where he is a man who knows his way around.</p>
        <p>''If all the world's a stage, the stoop at 258 East 109th Street was his proscenium of Ghetto Tragedy,'' Mr. Beatty's narrator says. Soon Winston has laid out an auxiliary policeman with a punch to the chin and shot his dog. Then he tells one of his friends, an unregenerate leftist revolutionary named Inez Yomura, what it's like to stab somebody.</p>
        <p>Winston, talking the talk of the street, refers to himself and to almost everybody with the most insulting racial epithet in the language, appropriated by the hip-hop culture as a kind of insider's insignia. Mr. Beatty's attempt in his portrayal of Winston parallels Winston's own almost pornographic use of the word, and of the sexual and racial meanness of his nonstop patter. You feel the impulse to dislike Winston, to judge him, but you can't, partly because he has charm, partly because he sees so clearly and partly because he does want a way out.</p>
        <p>The satirical heart of ''Tuff'' comes when Winston, given the absence of legal ways out, decides to turn his life around by running for city council. His elderly friend Inez gives him $15,000 of the reparation money she got for being held in a Japanese internment camp during World War II, but his campaign is half-hearted and despairing from the beginning, and Mr. Beatty mines it mostly for its satirical potential. One of Winston's opponents, for example, a book writer and ex-astronaut named German Jordan, complains at a debate that despite all he's done for the neighborhood, he still doesn't feel safe parking his Mercedes there.  Then he calls on his constituents ''to start imagining ourselves beyond race.''</p>
        <p>''If I'd been to outer space, written books, had dollars, drove a Mercedes-Benz, I'd imagine myself beyond race too,'' Winston says, in one of the few statements from him that would be quotable in this newspaper. But German Jordan is so much a straw man that the answer Mr. Beatty puts into Winston's mouth doesn't have much grip, serious or satirical. Mr. Beatty sustains his book's verbal vitality to the end, but you wonder whether, having created this raucous group of rugged individuals, he himself knew exactly what to do with them.</p>
