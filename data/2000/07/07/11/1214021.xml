        <p>Elizabeth Barret was a candidate for homecoming queen in her small Kentucky town in 1967 when she heard about the killing. A local man, respected but eccentric, had fatally shot a Canadian man for taking pictures of an impoverished miner and his baby.</p>
        <p>Some 30 years later, Ms. Barret could not remember what she thought then about the killing itself, but she did remember this: ''I didn't want the rest of the world to think of us as hillbillies, to see us as ignorant, backward or violent.''</p>
        <p>She would become a documentary filmmaker, making a career trying to show another side of her Kentucky home. In films like ''Quilting Women,'' ''Hand-Carved'' and ''Coal Mining Women,'' she has aimed to preserve Appalachian customs and history and to counter the stereotype of primitive shanty dwellers. But her work only heightened her memory of the killing. She empathized with Hugh O'Connor, the dead Canadian, who had been a respected documentary filmmaker, a colleague to others. By all accounts, and she listened to many, O'Connor's intentions had been honorable, not exploitative. Yet as a local herself she also understood the resentment that led Hobart Ison, the killer, to explode.</p>
        <p>She did what artists do: she used what was nagging her in her work. The result is ''Stranger With a Camera,'' a thoughtful and disturbing documentary about what  happened to O'Connor and why. But Ms. Barret's film has another important agenda. ''Can filmmakers show poverty without shaming the people we portray?'' she asks, raising the general question of exploitation. The issue is especially relevant today, with the blurring of entertainment and news and with video cameras everywhere.</p>
        <p>She has composed her investigation as a haunting narrative, but without losing sight of reportorial fairness. She interviewed witnesses to the murder, including both the O'Connor and Ison families, townspeople and reporters who covered the story (including Calvin Trillin, reading chilling excerpts from his 1969 article about the killing in The New Yorker).</p>
        <p>The film emerges as a provocative moral inquiry but also as a vivid portrait of a place and time, informed by Ms. Barret's gentle, personal rumination (with a beautifully  written narration by Fenton Johnson, a Kentucky novelist).</p>
        <p>Perhaps beginning with Walker Evans's famous Depression-era images, Appalachia's poor people became irresistible subjects for photographers. It seemed ennobling to expose the poverty, and the worn faces and shanties also happened to make powerful pictures.</p>
        <p>By the 1960's, a time of national prosperity and mounting interest in documentary journalism, Appalachia was a hot spot for reporters. There was good copy and even better images of poverty amid plenty: gap-toothed coal miners living in shacks, lovely rolling hills littered with the hulks of wrecked cars.</p>
        <p>President Johnson sat on the front porch of a humble house and declared his War on Poverty. After that, says a local newspaper publisher interviewed for Ms. Barret's film, ''Almost every time you looked out there was a newspaper reporter or magazine reporter or television reporter or crew coming through.'' Ms. Barret shows us headlines from The New York Times (''Poverty, Squalor and Idleness Prevail in Mountain Area'') and CBS news film from a report by Charles Kuralt, which showed poor rural children singing Christmas carols.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barret, who grew up on the prosperous side of the tracks, recalls feeling embarrassed for those children, who didn't live far from her. But then she lets us hear from the local newspaper publisher, who insists that the reports were necessary because the area's troubles were  real. ''The nation really needed to know and we needed the help of the nation,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Hugh O'Connor and Hobart Ison came to symbolize the two camps: journalists seeking to right wrongs by exposing them and civilians who felt they were being snooped on by outsiders who edited their stories to suit a particular narrative, even if it wasn't the entire truth.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barret manages to make both of them sympathetic, though it's more of a stretch for Ison, who vented his outrage (even if it's made understandable) with unacceptable violence. But, as someone says, he was a man of his time and place.</p>
        <p>The Ison family went to eastern Kentucky at the end of the 19th century and bought lots of land. Hobart's bond to that land was fierce, his relatives explain. He didn't seem to have much else. His fiancee broke their engagement, whereupon he locked the cozy house he had built for them and let it stand unused, a monument to his failed romance. Besides his land, he loved his guns; he would go as far as Alaska to hunt. Even his family did not know him well, just that he would help anyone who asked  but had no tolerance for trespassers.</p>
        <p>In Ison's eyes, O'Connor was the ultimate trespasser. Hired to make a film about poverty in America, the Canadian documentary maker had stopped with his crew at a shanty  owned by Ison, who rented several such houses -- and asked the miner living there if he could film him with his baby. The miner agreed. Word  travels fast in the country and Ison heard what was going on. He drove over and fired several shots. Two were lodged in the camera, and one exploded in O'Connor's chest.</p>
        <p>Reading from his New Yorker article, Mr. Trillin describes the moment: ''Mr. O'Connor briefly looked down in amazement and saw a hole in his chest, and he looked up in despair, and said, 'Why did you have to do that?' ''</p>
        <p>With heart-wrenching acuity, Ms. Barret has explained why.</p>
