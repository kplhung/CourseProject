        <p>''Fashion is about never achieving anything,'' Karl Lagerfeld said a month ago in an interview. ''You make one good collection, it doesn't mean there will be another.'' Yet this sense of futility, combined with the prospect of renewal, is also what drives designers like Mr. Lagerfeld, maybe all creative people, and he likened it to the lash that keeps newspaper writers toiling in pulp.</p>
        <p>''Your work,'' he told me, ''is ready for the vegetable drippings, and ours is for the markdowns. We know this, and that's why we start again.''</p>

        <p>''Fashion is about never achieving anything,'' Karl Lagerfeld said a month ago in an interview. ''You make one good collection, it doesn't mean there will be another.'' Yet this sense of futility, combined with the prospect of renewal, is also what drives designers like Mr. Lagerfeld, maybe all creative people, and he likened it to the lash that keeps newspaper writers toiling in pulp.</p>
        <p>''Your work,'' he told me, ''is ready for the vegetable drippings, and ours is for the markdowns. We know this, and that's why we start again.''</p>
        <p>And knowing this makes it easier to view the frank display of fetishism that John Galliano put on the runway for Christian Dior on Saturday -- the start of the fall 2000 haute couture collections -- without taking any of it too seriously. So Mr. Galliano likes the idea of seeing women trussed up in bondage gear against a background noise of whips and sighs? Last season it was the down-and-out look of tramps that lit his lamp, and made front-page news.</p>
        <p>But can any of this really matter if the action is constantly, and blithely, shifting? Now a bum, now a voyeur peeping through a keyhole at what was, and may still be, taboo. ''Very edgy,'' said the actress Kate Capshaw of the show, as she made her way through a throng of photographers and autograph seekers with her husband, Steven Spielberg. ''Very Kubrickian,'' Mr. Spielberg said. And in a way, it was. The show, bathed in carnal red lights, conjured up a vision of disorder and sexual obsession that brought to mind the violence and perversity in Kubrick's ''Eyes Wide Shut'' and ''A Clockwork Orange.''</p>
        <p>Here, on the runway, were suave-looking young men in smooth Mayfair lounge haircuts and the crisply tailored regalia of empire, circa 1912 -- officers' field coats, tails and top hats, a kilt exquisitely worked in sequins. They strolled out among women in reedy, quivering ivory frocks and mushrooming Edwardian hairdos. And then the tempo changed: Mr. Galliano, who had said before the show that he thought Christian Dior was one of the first fetishists in fashion, because he had put women in corsets and was himself ''in complete awe of his mother,'' parted the curtain, opened the kimono, to reveal the mischief (naughty nurse, fleshy maid with a hickey on her neck) of a nice, respectable Edwardian family.</p>
        <p>Ten or 15 years ago, before the dawn of tabloid television, one could have been shocked by the sight of a woman with her mouth taped shut or another with her arms held down by handcuffs chained to her belt. And, of course, one can think of the designers who have been this way before -- namely, Gianni Versace, Jean Paul Gaultier and Vivienne Westwood.</p>
        <p>When news of the Dior show trickled back to him, Mr. Lagerfeld said he could never bring himself to seriously design clothes with whips and zips because he'd be laughing too hard. That's sort of the way one felt. Many of the clothes were undeniably spectacular -- a coat made of tiny stripes of feathers, a gown cut from a length of alligator skin, a dress of cadet-blue silk with gold military buttons and lacing up the back. It's also true that the Dior workrooms were flooded with orders from the spring hobo collection, especially from young clients, though most designs were toned down.</p>
        <p>And so will the latest examples be. As I sat at lunch today at L'Avenue, the swanky bistro, a Dior staff assistant happened by with a portfolio of sketches of this collection made palatable for clients. So there's no reason to get in a twist over Saturday's outrage. It's already history.</p>
        <p>Alexander McQueen has had enough uneven seasons at Givenchy to generate rumors that this would be his last. But after his show on Sunday, as guests poured backstage, Yves Carcelle, the president of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the owner, was dismissive of the gossip. ''It's just another rumor in the perverted fashion world,'' he said. Mr. McQueen's show -- a kind of party within a party -- was brilliant.</p>
        <p>The set, concealed by four walls that dropped down when the show began, resembled the sort of funky loft one might see in the East Village. Cool couples danced around. A D.J. flipped electronic switches next to a refrigerator. And then came the models, wending among the party people, in couture's version of modern club clothes.</p>
        <p>Here was the model Alek Wek in patchwork leather hip-huggers with some sort of flippy-hippy jacket over her zebra top and a cocoon of fur around her head. Nothing really went together, yet everything did. A strait-laced jumpsuit, a go-go girl get-up in pastel leather, a Super Fly cap ballooning like a beanbag chair -- but of course. It's hard to make couture seem valid in a world where sometimes the choicest thing is a cut-off T-shirt and a pierced navel. But it's also hard to bring a sense of real individuality to clothes without the imaginative ballast of couture. Mr. McQueen is a genuine guide.</p>
        <p>On her way into Versace on Saturday night, Jennifer Lopez, dressed in a low-cut Versace number and accompanied by her boyfriend, Sean Combs, and the usual posse of bodyguards, said in a plaintive voice to Donatella Versace, ''But I want to know what I'm going to wear to the Oscars!''</p>
        <p>Evidently she can't wait to find out. Nor can Mr. Spielberg and Ms. Capshaw, who were front and center. Nor can Gwyneth Paltrow, who seems to have evolved into a karaoke couture client -- wearing this dress from Calvin, touting that bag for Dior and surfacing, not for the first time, in Versace.</p>
        <p>But this is fashion -- it's anybody's game, and Ms. Versace knows how to play it with confidence. Her clothes this season emphasize softness, with hints of volume in sleeves, and cool colors like lavender, melon and chartreuse. Sun-ray pleats burst with tiny stones. A floor-length sable coat draped over a filmy top and a tight pair of pants -- Ms. Versace called it the new cocktail suit. The clothes were the kind you could imagine on anyone with a body, a taste for flashbulb glamour and the means to indulge it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaultier's approach, on the other hand, is decidedly more French, and more in the deep grain of tradition. His show on Sunday lacked the mesmerizing vivacity of last season, when his orders doubled. But it was solid, with hints of the 1920's, in loose-fitting dresses with beaded fringe and feathered wigs swathed in netting. Mr. Gaultier's homage to the Eiffel Tower -- upturned as heels, sparkling in beads -- could have been a hard right to the souvenir stands of the Rue de Rivoli without his clever eye.</p>
        <p>So the new guard keeps advancing while the older denizens of couture do their best to keep up. Valentino's show, on Sunday night, was exquisitely heavy going, chic to a fault -- the right shoe, the right display of beads, but all without feeling. Emanuel Ungaro's show today, in a tunnel near the Seine, was all lightness. Beautiful, weightless jackets floated over slender trousers and tops as simple as T-shirts. Feathers of distressed chiffon glazed a coral coat, and siren gowns in ivory and lavender were a modern update of the ravish-me style.</p>
        <p>And, of course, there was that sense of family as new and old clients swanned in blowing air kisses. As Nan Kempner, arriving at the Ungaro show in a Saint Laurent python coat, said, ''I think my epitaph should read, 'I've kissed a heck of a lot of people I don't know.' ''</p>
