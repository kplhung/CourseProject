        <p>Medical experiments involving people at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center at Tulsa have been suspended on the orders of federal investigators who found numerous safety and ethics violations.</p>
        <p>The action was taken by the Office for Human Research Protections of the Department of Health and Human Services, after an investigation showed that about 100 patients in one experiment were injected with a vaccine that had been made by unqualified laboratory workers and had never been safety-tested, and other violations. The suspension was first reported yesterday in USA Today.</p>
        <p>The order, issued June 29, halted about 75 experiments at the Tulsa center involving humans. The investigation first focused on one experiment, in which patients with the fatal skin cancer melanoma were given a test vaccine. In reviewing that experiment, federal and university officials found that the center's Institutional Review Board was routinely violating federal safety and ethics rules.</p>
        <p>After hearing of problems in the melanoma experiment, the university conducted its own investigation and brought in a consulting firm. In March the firm recommended that the experiment, run by Dr. Michael McGee, be shut down immediately because of safety questions, and that the vaccine used in it be quarantined and either destroyed or labeled ''not for use in humans.'' The experiment was halted on March 9.</p>
        <p>But federal investigators found that university officials had failed to tell the patients of the vaccine's safety problems and misrepresented the reason the experiment was being halted. The researchers also failed to report the safety problems to the members of the Institutional Review Board and federal officials, as the federal rules require.</p>
        <p>In addition to concerns about the safety of the vaccine, investigators found that in recruiting patients for the study, health center doctors misled candidates by stating that the experiment might reduce the size of their tumors, when in fact the study was intended only to test the toxicity of the vaccine, not to treat patients. The doctors also failed to warn patients of the risks of suspending their regular treatments in favor of the non-treatment vaccine tests.</p>
        <p>About 100 patients were enrolled in that study, and 26 died. It is believed that most or all died of their disease, not of the untested vaccine. But that is unclear because researchers at the center did not carry out the necessary checks to see whether there were negative reactions to the vaccine, a federal official said.</p>
        <p>After its inquiry, the university removed Dr. McGee as vice chairman of the department of surgery.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Lackey, president of the Tulsa campus, said, ''There is no excuse for what we did.'' He added that he has been given answers on why the problems occurred, ''but  they are not good answers.'' Dr. McGee's office referred calls to the university.</p>
        <p>The university also removed Dr. Daniel Plunket as head of the Institutional Review Board.</p>
