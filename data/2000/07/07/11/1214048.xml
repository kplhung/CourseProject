        <p>Gail Collins Op-Ed column on presidential politics in month of July; says month is special in American politics since it represents semiofficial civic vacation from presidential politics (M)</p>

        <p>Ah, July. The children commune with Harry Potter while their parents watch the ''Big Brother'' roommates try to make an alarm clock out of a couple of potatoes. (Where's Al Gore when you need a consult?) Just outside our nation's capital, kids of all ages have been flocking to an arcade in Rockville, Md., to ride on The Shocker, an electric chair simulation that challenges patrons to hang on until smoke comes out of their skulls. (Where's George W. Bush when you need a photo op?)</p>
        <p>July is a special month in American politics, a semiofficial civic vacation from the yearlong presidential campaign. Admittedly, most Americans have already been on hiatus from this race for so long they've forgotten the names of the candidates. (Is Gary Bauer in this somewhere? What ever happened to Orrin Hatch?) But that was a springtime form of inattention. We overlooked George W. Bush and Al Gore absent-mindedly, the way we neglected to catch ''Mission Impossible 2.'' In July you can ignore politics in a decisive, activist way, the way we did ''The Patriot.''</p>

        <p>Ah, July. The children commune with Harry Potter while their parents watch the ''Big Brother'' roommates try to make an alarm clock out of a couple of potatoes.

        <p>July is a special month in American politics, a semiofficial civic vacation from the yearlong presidential campaign. Admittedly, most Americans have already been on hiatus from this race for so long they've forgotten the names of the candidates. (Is Gary Bauer in this somewhere? What ever happened to Orrin Hatch?) But that was a springtime form of inattention. We overlooked George W. Bush and Al Gore absent-mindedly, the way we neglected to catch ''Mission Impossible 2.'' In July you can ignore politics in a decisive, activist way, the way we did ''The Patriot.''</p>
        <p>The biggest political news last weekend in New York City was that Rudy Giuliani's motorcade got in a wreck en route to a Mets-Yankees game; this is what happens when you attempt to drive an S.U.V. to a subway series. ''I was wearing a seat belt, which I think is a very, very good idea,'' said the uninjured mayor, who never passes up the opportunity to deliver an improving lecture. Given the run of luck this guy has had recently, you would not be surprised if he insisted on being swaddled in bubble wrap.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has turned into a lame duck overnight. You can practically see pieces of him fading away before your eyes, like the hero in ''Back to the Future.'' He's not the only term-limited official around, of course. Look at Bill Clinton these days and you'll notice an arm disappearing from this picture, a leg from that. Once the Democratic Convention is over next month, Mr. Clinton will seem as dim as a 20-year-old Polaroid.</p>
        <p>But that's an August problem -- August looks like summer, but it's really autumn with high temperatures, full of back-to-school sales and professional football. July, on the other hand, is a month that imposes so few demands that it will be happy if it just succeeds in eliminating a few more people from the ''Survivor''  island. Three weeks from now, Sean-the-neurologist-with-nipple-ring and  Susan-the-tough-talking-truck-driver will no longer be part of the ongoing national dialogue, and July can declare victory. Unless, of course, Al Gore picks one of them as his running mate.</p>
        <p>Vice-presidential speculation is very July -- as restfully meaningless as the All-Star Game. It also drowns out the sound of the actual presidential race, which is currently something like this:</p>
        <p>Gore Challenges Do-Nothing-for-People Congress. Video available via satellite and webcast.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush to Unveil His Initiative to Ensure Safe Children and Strong Families in Royal Oak, Mich.</p>
        <p>The e-mails keep arriving, but we have stretched out under a tree, where we can mentally count vice-presidential candidates as they jump over a fence.</p>
        <p>Current conventional wisdom holds that Mr. Gore's choice of a vice-presidential nominee will be greatly influenced by Mr. Bush, who goes first at the Republican Convention in Philadelphia. Mr. Bush is said to be looking for someone boring, the better to avoid a moment like the one in 1988 when the words ''Dan Quayle'' created a Mardi-Gras-like sense of anticipation in the press room at the Republican Convention.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush selects Gov. George Pataki of New York, who was his classmate at Yale, Mr. Gore might pick Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, a fellow alumnus of St. Albans in Washington D.C. Both slates could embark on the ceremonial post-convention bus tour wearing their school jackets, waving pom-poms out the window.</p>
        <p>However, the Republican Party ought to consider giving the nod to Mr. Giuliani, who is currently operating under a misalignment of the stars so powerful that he might serve as a kind of a magnet, drawing political misfortune away from the guy at the top. If that happened, Mr. Gore would undoubtedly want to hunt up a bigger, more powerful bad luck magnet of his own -- say, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.</p>
