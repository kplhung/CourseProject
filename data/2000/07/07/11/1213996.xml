        <p>Do you want to keep eating, even if it means dying of pneumonia? That was the question I posed to Mr. C. as he ate the rest of his lunch. Yes, he replied without hesitation.</p>
        <p>A wizened 77-year-old with fiery eyes, he had been admitted to the hospital  short of breath. It wasn't clear why. He did not smoke and had no cough. There was nothing suggesting asthma, pneumonia, congestive heart failure or other common causes of shortness of breath.</p>
        <p>His chest X-ray gave it away. Littering both lung bases were opaque speckles that turned out to be barium, a metal that exposes internal organs on X-rays.</p>
        <p>But why was it in his lungs? He had undergone a barium-swallowing test a few months earlier when doctors suspected he was aspirating food into his lungs. To rule out esophageal narrowing, a common cause of swallowing difficulties, he swallowed barium and had X-rays. It went down his lungs, and stayed there.</p>
        <p>His breathing trouble, I suspected, was caused by intermittent aspiration of barium, food or whatever else. I told him he should strictly regulate his diet, avoiding thin liquids that are easily aspirated. He would have to eat sitting up, and in small bites. But he said he had already found such a diet too burdensome.</p>
        <p>When a person swallows, both voluntary and involuntary mechanisms ensure the food ends up in the stomach and not the lungs. First, the tongue pushes the chewed-up food to the back of the throat, where sensory receptors cause muscles in the pharynx to contract. As the muscles contract, the epiglottis, a flap of cartilage, flexes protectively into place over the larynx, preventing food from entering the windpipe. The food is propelled into the esophagus, where contractions usher it down to the lower esophageal sphincter, which allows entry into the stomach.</p>
        <p>Several things can disrupt this complex reflex. Cancer or blockages can narrow the opening so that food does not pass easily to the stomach but backs up in the pharynx, where it can be aspirated into the lungs. Muscular dystrophy, polymyositis and scleroderma can paralyze the pharyngeal muscles.</p>
        <p>Neurological dysfunction, too, from nerve diseases like polio and Lou Gehrig's disease, or brain disorders, like Alzheimer's dementia or strokes, can disrupt the complex signaling.</p>
        <p>The reason for Mr. C.'s swallowing trouble wasn't obvious. A brain scan revealed no strokes. There was no constriction. Nerve studies were normal. In the end, we were faced with a condition we could neither explain nor treat very effectively. The safest treatment was to stop him from eating and insert a feeding tube. But he so loved to eat -- it was one of the few remaining pleasures in his life. He even raved about the hospital food. I presented the option to him. He said he wasn't interested. It was too high a price to pay, even for a longer life.</p>
        <p>Swallowing dysfunction is one of the most common problems in a hospital, and it is becoming more prevalent as life spans increase. This year, an editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine criticized as futile and harmful the routine placement of feeding tubes into patients with advanced dementia who stop eating. On the other hand, it said, careful hand-feeding of such patients is an act of nurturing.</p>
        <p>But feeding someone who cannot eat, by any means necessary, is almost a reflexive act. New York State law says tube feeding can be withheld only if there is clear and convincing evidence that the patient never wants it. The default position is to feed.</p>
        <p>The paradigm is shifting, but the process will be slow. Families will have to accept that feeding cannot sustain life in the face of terminal diseases. And nursing homes, already short-staffed, will have to figure out a way to hand-feed their patients efficiently.</p>
        <p>But what about the patients like Mr. C., dying not because they are starving but because they are eating?</p>
        <p>I remember a 60-year-old lawyer I took care of last year. He was admitted to the hospital because of severe emphysema. A protracted stay in the intensive care unit left him dependent on a ventilator, with a breathing tube. The tube (and  his illness) had so impaired his swallowing that he aspirated whenever he was fed. He constantly got pneumonia.</p>
        <p>Everyone thought he needed a feeding tube, but his private doctor, intelligent and experienced, insisted we feed him. ''You must feed him,'' he reminded the nurses, ''if he is to learn to eat.'' One day I told the doctor hand-feeding didn't seem to be working. Wouldn't a feeding tube be useful to help the patient regain his strength? ''I know this patient and who he was,'' the doctor replied. ''A feeding tube will kill him.''</p>
