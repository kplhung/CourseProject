        <p>Against a backdrop of increasing concern over the safety of genetically modified crops, the National Academy of Sciences plans to take the unusual step today of joining with six foreign academies of science to urge the increased development and use of biotechnology crops to solve problems of hunger and poverty in developing nations.</p>
        <p>Describing genetic engineering as an important tool that can provide more nutritious crops and disease-resistant plants, the academies will call for increased support from governments as well as industry, including increased research financing for scientists and the freer use of patented gene technologies by farmers in developing nations.</p>
