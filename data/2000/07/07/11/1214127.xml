        <p>The monumental trade between the Yankees and the Blue Jays took place 17 months ago, when Roger Clemens came to New York for David Wells and two other players.

        <p>The monumental trade between the Yankees and the Blue Jays took place 17 months ago, when Roger Clemens came to New York for David Wells and two other players. The Yankees obtained a five-time Cy Young award winner who won the decisive game of the 1999 World Series, and Toronto got a rebellious pitcher who has actually become heftier.</p>
        <p>Yet, there is no disputing the notion that Toronto got the best of a trade that brought them Wells, Homer Bush and Graeme Lloyd. The deal was really about Wells and Clemens, and Wells could be gloating because he is 15-2 this year and was selected by Joe Torre, his former manager, to start the All-Star Game on Tuesday night. The National League starter will be Randy Johnson, who is 14-2 with a 1.80 earned run average and 198 strikeouts in 144 2/3 innings.</p>
        <p>Clemens did not make the team for the second straight year.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't my decision to trade me,'' Wells said. ''Obviously, they thought it made sense to trade me. You move on. I don't hold any grudges.''</p>
        <p>Since the trade, Wells is 32-12 and Clemens is 20-16. Because the Yankees won another World Series, they could argue that the deal was successful because the team achieved its goal. But George Steinbrenner would surely choose Wells over Clemens if he could make another trade. Especially since the Yankees' principal owner has an agreement with Clemens for a two-year extension worth about $27 million.</p>
        <p>When Wells was asked if he was better than Clemens, he said: ''I don't worry about it. I move on.''</p>
        <p>Wells has a head that is balder than Mr. Clean and a scraggly goatee that looks like a thorn bush. He wears a uniform jersey that could serve as a tent for a few toddlers and pants that are baggy enough to hold watermelons. But, for all of the attention Wells receives for his eccentricities, he also has a rubber arm, amazing control and a passion for winning.</p>
        <p>''He might not be the best dressed pitcher,'' Torre said, ''but he might be the best pitcher.''</p>
        <p>Even if Pedro Martinez, last season's Cy Young award winner, had been healthy enough to pitch in the game, Torre said he would still have chosen Wells as the starter because ''you can't count out 15 wins.''</p>
        <p>Wells, who has constantly deflected questions about Clemens and the Yankees, said it would have been unfair to the Blue Jays for him to pine for New York after a deal that depressed him. Someone mentioned that the Yankees unloaded Wells to get Clemens, but also because they were worried Wells would fizzle.</p>
        <p>With a bow to the children in attendance, Wells called that ''hogwash.''</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's a point to prove at any time,'' Wells said. ''I know what I can do. Right now, I could strangle Joe if I wanted to.''</p>
        <p>Torre, who was sitting beside Wells on a podium, said, ''Maybe that would slow you down.''</p>
        <p>Wells said it took three days for him to get over the sting of being traded, a bold declaration because David Cone expressed how distraught Wells was at the time. Now Wells is with the Blue Jays and they are tied for first place with the Yankees, mostly because of a lopsided trade that seemed logical when it was made.</p>
        <p>''When things happen like that, you have to think of it as a business,'' Wells said. ''New York is where I wanted to play. I wanted to finish my career there. They traded for Roger Clemens. You can't cry about it. Life goes on.''</p>
