        <p>Reacting to widespread concern over climbing heating oil prices and low inventories, President Clinton announced a plan yesterday to establish a two-million-barrel fuel reserve for the Northeast, where most of the country's heating oil is consumed.</p>
        <p>The plan calls for swapping crude oil from the federal government's 570-million-barrel strategic petroleum reserve for heating oil from refineries or marketers.</p>
        <p>''Winter may seem far off on this hot day, but if we don't do something now, reserve stocks of heating oil may not be in place before the cold weather comes,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''The action I take today will leave us far better prepared to face the winter months, but it does not relieve Congress of the responsibility to act.''</p>
        <p>But some analysts and politicians portrayed the plans to create a reserve as a symbolic gesture that might temporarily placate consumers but would not be enough to reverse rapidly rising prices nor compensate for a nationwide shortfall in heating oil inventories.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a good first step, but we have a 36-million-barrel shortfall in heating oil,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.</p>
        <p>''This could prevent the worst of the price spikes, but it won't be large enough to deal with the root problem of a supply shortfall and high demand.''</p>
        <p>Traditionally in the summer refineries begin to stockpile distillate, which includes heating oil and diesel. But thriving United States companies have been shipping a prodigious amount of goods around the country, which has led to uncharacteristically high demand for diesel.</p>
        <p>As a result, there are only 103.7 million barrels of distillate fuel oil stockpiled so far, compared with 137.3 million barrels a year ago, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. In the Northeast, this year's stockpiles are off by a similar margin.</p>
        <p>Low inventories, in turn, have driven heating oil prices up 10 percent in the last month alone. The fear is the prices will continue to rise and that the Northeast may face a repeat of  last winter's troubles, when a heating oil shortage led to a doubling in fuel prices.</p>
        <p>White House officials said that the Defense Energy Supply Center, a Defense Department unit responsible for military fuel procurement, will begin seeking offers in about two weeks from refiners in exchange for the strategic petroleum reserve crude. The administration said it would try to have the heating oil reserve in place by October.</p>
        <p>But it is uncertain what kind of events or price levels would lead to the release of the fuel. The administration and Congress would have to come up with explicit guidelines for a so-called trigger to distribute the heating oil, which could turn into a tug-of-war because of impending elections. The government would also have to trade more than two million barrels of crude to get the heating oil, because the heating oil costs more than the crude being offered, analysts said.</p>
        <p>White House officials were also vague about steps the government could take to soften the blow an even greater number of consumers will feel this winter from high natural gas prices, which have doubled from levels a year ago because of higher-than-usual demand.</p>
        <p>The administration is trying to persuade Congress to pass an oil and gas production tax break to increase natural gas supplies. But even if the administration succeeded, consumers would not get lower prices until late winter.</p>
        <p>The only bit of consolation for consumers came from a decline in crude oil prices, as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries seemed to be softening toward Saudi Arabia's plan to produce an additional 500,000 barrels a day. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, the benchmark August crude closed at $29.69 a barrel, down 59 cents from Friday.</p>
