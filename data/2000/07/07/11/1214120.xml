        <p>One free-agent signing down. Two free agents and a new coach to go. It promises to be a busy week for Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager..</p>
        <p>''It could be,'' Sather said yesterday, while announcing the signing of the 31-year-old defenseman Vladimir Malakhov, who will become just the third player in National Hockey League history to play for all three New York area teams.</p>
        <p>After attending the wedding of his son Shanon, Sather got down to official business yesterday by announcing that he had signed Malakhov to a guaranteed four-year contract, with a dual club/player option for a fifth season.</p>
        <p>Sather is scheduled to fly to New York today from his vacation home in Banff, Alberta. All indications are that the Rangers will announce tomorrow that after a messy separation and three seasons in Vancouver, Mark Messier is re-signing with the team he led to the Stanley Cup six seasons ago.</p>
        <p>Before the Messier news conference, Sather is expected to speak again to Mike Keenan, about the  coaching vacancy. But the conversation is believed to be a formality. Ron Low, the 50-year-old former coach of the Edmonton Oilers, was in Banff over the weekend to attend Shanon Sather's wedding. Low should be announced as the Rangers' coach before week's end, two league officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>And then, there is still the matter of coming to terms with right wing Claude Lemieux, who turns 35 this Sunday. Lemieux, long hated by Rangers fans for what they regarded as dirty play with the Devils, is the last player on Sather's free-agent wish list this summer.</p>
        <p>Malakhov, who helped lead the Devils to the Stanley Cup this season, will join Sergei Nemchinov and Pat Conacher as the only players who have played for the Rangers, Devils and Islanders.</p>
        <p>Malakhov's new contract with the Rangers calls for him to be paid $3.5 million a season for the next four seasons. His option year will pay him either $3.5 million more, or $4.25 million more, depending on which side picks up the option.</p>
        <p>''I finally got an offer from the Rangers and I decided to stay in the Big Apple,'' said Malakhov, who said he turned down a five-year deal from the Dallas Stars as well as a bid from the Florida Panthers. ''I started out here. I like it here.''</p>
        <p>The Devils, Malakhov said, never tendered him an offer. The Stars, said Paul Theofanus, Malakhov's agent, were intrigued with the idea of having Malakhov -- an offensive defenseman -- play with Derian Hatcher at even strength and Sergei Zubov on the power play.</p>
        <p>But Sather said he had been told that Malakhov preferred to stay in the Eastern Conference. And Theofanus said that Malakhov is looking forward to playing with Brian Leetch on the power play and reteaming with Stephane Quintal at even strength. Malakhov and Quintal were defensive partners in Montreal.</p>
        <p>Sather seemed especially intrigued by the possibility of pairing Malakhov with Leetch on special teams. More than once, Sather harkened back to Leetch's success with Zubov on the power play the season the Rangers won the cup.</p>
        <p>''He's going to take some pressure off of Leetch,'' said Sather, referring to Malakhov.</p>
        <p>Not to mention a power play that began the season 9 for 112, as the Rangers dug themselves a hole in the standing from which they never could extricate themselves.</p>
        <p>Not that Malakhov is the answer on his own. Though tremendously talented, Malakhov has been nearly as frustrating to his coaches and teammates through his first 8 N.H.L. seasons.</p>
        <p>''Malakhov clearly has got that superstar ability,'' Sather said. More often than not, though, Malakhov has not lived up to it. ''You wonder whether it's the teams he's played on or the partners he was playing with,'' Sather said.</p>
        <p>Or whether the fault lies with Malakhov himself?</p>
        <p>''Whether or not he goes one step better and does it is purely up to him and the coaching staff,'' Sather said.</p>
        <p>Sather made it clear that he signed Malakhov because he is not going to re-sign two free agents who played defense for the Rangers last season: Mathieu Schneider and Kevin Hatcher. ''So I've got some money to play with,'' Sather said.</p>
        <p>And plenty more of it figures to be spent before the week is through.</p>
