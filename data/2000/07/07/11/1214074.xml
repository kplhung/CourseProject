        <p>While the two biggest targets of the free-agent pool may have eluded them, the Knicks are continuing their pursuit of Portland's hard-nosed power forward, Brian Grant.</p>
        <p>According to a person familiar with Grant's plans, the 28-year-old forward will fly to New York this week to visit with the Knicks, something that they could not coax Grant Hill or Tim Duncan to do.</p>
        <p>Because of the Knicks' salary-cap situation, it is believed that it will take a sign-and-trade agreement to bring Grant to New York and the Trail Blazers' asking price is likely to be either Latrell Sprewell or Allan Houston.</p>
        <p>Grant opted out of his contract this summer, escaping a deal that would have paid him an additional $40 million over the next four seasons, and if he were to leave Portland, it would be for playing time, not money. He averaged a career-low 21 minutes per game this season, averaging just 7.3 points and 5.5 rebounds per game.</p>
        <p>The Knicks are still awaiting the arrival of Frederic Weiss, the 1999 No. 1 draft pick. He remained in France to be with his father, who was ill, and has still not made the trip. Camp begins tomorrow.</p>
        <p>''It would have been nice to have him in much sooner, so we could get a look at him,'' General Manager Scott Layden said.</p>
