        <p>While Al Gore was signing up to fight in (or at least write about) a war that he did not believe in, George W. Bush was somewhat less resolutely partying in Houston.

        <p>While Al Gore was signing up to fight in (or at least write about) a war that he did not believe in, George W. Bush was somewhat less resolutely partying in Houston.  Mr. Bush, like many young conservatives, had doubts about the war but was nonetheless inclined to support it -- though not necessarily to the point of fighting in it.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush graduated from Yale in 1968, he was in roughly the same situation as Mr. Gore was upon graduation from Harvard a year later. Both were Southern men in Ivy League colleges, and both had fathers in Congress who might suffer politically if their sons fled to Canada or took extraordinary measures to avoid the draft.</p>
        <p>Yet the two sons entered the military in markedly different ways.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Gore, who enlisted in the Army, taking a path that he knew would lead to South Vietnam, Mr. Bush signed up to be a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard. It was a coveted posting that significantly reduced any risk that he would be sent to Vietnam, and it probably would not have been obtainable if his father had been less prominent.</p>
        <p>''Did I think about going to the Army post and saying, 'Send me to Vietnam?' '' Mr. Bush asked in an interview. ''Not really. I wanted to fly, and that was the adventure I was seeking.''</p>
        <p>The decisions they made were deeply in character.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was always a serious, ambitious young man struggling with deep moral questions and, in the case of Vietnam, with deeply practical calculations about how his actions would play in his father's re-election campaign. Some critics have also suggested that in later years he embellished his Vietnam role for his own political career.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, in contrast, was a carefree, happy-go-lucky fellow who was not disposed to agonize over anything more grand than his Saturday night plans. He was not the kind of person to choose to swelter in the Vietnamese jungle.</p>
        <p>In a sense, while Mr. Gore might have been more conscientious or responsible, Mr. Bush was far more normal.</p>
        <p>While the Bush campaign likes to suggest that service in the Guard was an entirely honorable alternative to Vietnam, in 1988 one of Mr. Bush's father's strongest backers (and future chief of staff), John H. Sununu, publicly criticized the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Lloyd Bentsen, for getting his son into the Guard. That was maladroit, since another young man in the same unit as Mr. Bentsen's son was George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Asked if he discussed the war with his father, the younger Mr. Bush says he must have but cannot recall any details. Likewise, roommates and a girlfriend from that period say they do not recall Mr. Bush saying much about the war, and he came across as a lukewarm supporter at a time when most people were passionate one way or the other.</p>
        <p>''My first impulse and first inclination was to support the country,'' Mr. Bush recalled in an interview.</p>
        <p>Vietnam filtered into the popular consciousness in many ways, but for Mr. Bush and many of his classmates a crucial moment came with the death of George W. Carpenter. Mr. Carpenter, an acquaintance of Mr. Bush and the boyfriend of a cousin, grew up on Long Island and had been valedictorian and class president in high school, as well as captain of the football team.</p>
        <p>At Yale, the dark-haired, 6-foot-4 Mr. Carpenter was a striking, fun-loving figure, but he was expelled in his freshman year for misbehaving. Having lost his deferment, he signed up for the Marine Corps and was sent to Vietnam, where he was patrolling on Feb. 17, 1967, when his squad came upon an obstacle on the trail.</p>
        <p>It was a mine that exploded and killed him; he was 20. The death sent a shiver through the Yale campus, and, for classmates like Mr. Bush, Vietnam suddenly seemed more real and dangerous than ever.</p>
        <p>Yet almost anybody clever enough to get into Harvard or Yale could find a way to evade the draft.</p>
        <p>''For guys in the Ivy League at that time, there was nobody that I recall very well standing up and saying, 'Hey, my country calls and if these guys from the inner city are going to war, then, by God, so will I,' '' said John T. Sartore, a friend of Mr. Bush at Yale. ''Most people were wandering around figuring out how to get out of it, and there were so many ways: getting married, getting orthotics for your feet, getting braces, failing the medical, joining the Peace Corps and so on.''</p>
        <p>Many of the routes to evade service in Vietnam were out of the question for a man like Mr. Bush, rooted in conservative Texas values. He seems never to have considered pretending to be gay, going to prison for refusing to fight, or fleeing to Canada, and he had his father's political career to worry about.</p>
        <p>''It was a very hairy time, and I think George had a little different pressure because his father was a public figure,'' said Roland W. Betts, one of Mr. Bush's fraternity brothers at Yale.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Bush recalls it, ''There was no question in my mind that there was going to be a military service in 1969.''</p>
        <p>One of the most socially acceptable routes to avoid Vietnam, for young Democrats and Republicans alike, was the National Guard. It counted as military service; it offered the opportunity to learn a skill, like flying fighter aircraft. And it provided a nearly iron-clad guarantee that its members would not wind up in Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Bush, the crucial step was applying for a position in the Texas Air National Guard while back in Houston for Christmas vacation in his senior year. Nationally, 100,000 people were on waiting lists to get into the Guard, and the details of Mr. Bush's admission to the unit are subject to debate.</p>
        <p>Critics say that the Bushes pulled rank, but there is no firm proof of this. It is clear, however, that whether or not he demanded it, Mr. Bush got special treatment because he was a Congressman's son.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush not only was admitted to a program with a long waiting list but also was promoted to second lieutenant without going to officer candidate school and jumping through the normal hoops. Likewise, he was given pilot training despite his lack of aviation experience.</p>
        <p>The Air National Guard was virtually made up of sons of the Who's Who in Texas. It was sometimes called the Champagne Unit, and among its members were sons of two other prominent Texas politicians, Mr. Bentsen and John B. Connally, and several wealthy Texas businessmen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, sensitive to suggestions that he shirked his responsibility in Vietnam, said that during his National Guard service he went to his commander, who is now dead, and asked to be admitted to the Palace Alert program, which could have sent him to Vietnam for a short stint.</p>
        <p>''I think I remember doing that,'' he said, but he added: ''I don't want to make it look that I would have been, but was thwarted by the bureaucracy.''</p>
        <p>In any case, as all the pilots knew, Mr. Bush's plane, the F-102, was virtually obsolete, and so there was little chance that he would be accepted for a mission in Vietnam. And, indeed, he was not.</p>
