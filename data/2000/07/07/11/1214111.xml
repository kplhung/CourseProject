        <p>Enveloped in the daze of the daily commuter, some people did not even notice the No. 6 train as it pulled into the 33rd Street station yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>It was, after all, stainless steel, just like hundreds of other subway trains. It roared in, belching heat like all trains do. And its doors looked like any old train doors to the impatient faces waiting for them to slide open.</p>
        <p>But then, as riders poured inside, they began to stop and blink and look alarmed, as if they had accidentally wandered into the wrong subway system. It was brighter, with sleek indirect lighting. It was cooler, almost cold, inside. There were computerized signs flashing the time and the next stop. There were understandable, airport-like announcements.</p>
        <p>And if that was not enough to reveal that a brand-new subway car had materialized on the rails, there was another tip-off: 10 television cameras jammed into the first car, along with enough reporters and top transit officials to accurately simulate rush-hour crowding.</p>
        <p>''This is just marvelous,'' said Maureen Leroy, a part-time paralegal. ''I mean, it's an occasion. I feel underdressed. I wish I had worn something more appropriate, a ball gown maybe.''</p>
        <p>The occasion was the beginning of the first 30-day passenger test for a new class of subway cars being built in Yonkers by Kawasaki Rail Car Inc. If the 10 cars that make up the prototype train pass the test, hundreds more of the new trains will begin to appear on the IRT lines -- the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and the 1/9 -- by the end of the year, joining several hundred almost identical new trains also being built in Plattsburgh, N.Y., by Bombardier, the Canadian train manufacturer.</p>
        <p>Together, the new cars -- initially 1,080 of them, with options for the New York City Transit to order about 400 more -- are expected to completely replace the oldest trains in the subway system, called Redbirds, built in the 1950's and now known mostly for their rusty hulls and screeching brakes.</p>
        <p>The cars put into service yesterday, which cost about $1.4 million each, are a stark contrast to the Redbirds. They have air-bag suspensions, which make for relatively fewer jolts along the route. They are also soundproofed better, meaning the ride is quieter and the announcements, featuring the polished recorded voices of Bloomberg radio and television commentators, can be heard better.</p>
        <p>Besides the electronic sign boards, the cars also have lighted maps, showing all the stops on the line and indicating the train's location along the line with a blinking light. The doorways have been widened to 54 inches from 50, to try to cut down on what transit planners call ''dwell time'' -- in other words, the time trains are stuck in stations while commuters slowly and angrily crowd in and out of the doors.</p>
        <p>The seats, a pale pastel blue, are bench style, unlike the narrow bucket-type seats in newer-model trains that many commuters say are not wide enough. And heaters have been moved further underneath the seats, so that riders have room to store bags behind their feet instead of in the way of other passengers.</p>
        <p>Almost every feature of the new train will be under intense scrutiny over the next 30 days, as it takes on passengers about 16 hours a day, seven days a week, a much longer shift than most trains now in service. And if one part fails, officials said, the 30-day test period will begin anew. Only after 30 days with no failures will the cars be passed, and orders will be put in for more.</p>
        <p>''It could be as minor as a door not working or a sign not working,'' said Lawrence G. Reuter, the president of New York City Transit. ''Everything has to work without fail for 30 days.''</p>
        <p>To judge by the commuters who filed into the cars yesterday, smiling and testing their backs against the support-curved seats, there will be a lot of New Yorkers rooting for the train to hold up under the strain.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we should just stay on here all day, man,'' said Kevin Muoio, an analyst for Jupiter Communications, who had crowded in with two colleagues, Ross Rubin and Michael Winston, on the way to a business meeting. ''I like it. It's very clean and well-lighted.''</p>
        <p>Mike and Angela Kearns, schoolteachers in New York on vacation from Oregon, passed through the doors of the train and unwittingly right into a genuine New York event. They watched, slightly bedazzled, as E. Virgil Conway, the pinstriped chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, held forth in front of a bank of television cameras, clutching his silver-handled cane.</p>
        <p>''I guess we sure picked the right train today,'' Ms. Kearns said.</p>
        <p>She added, in a lower voice, ''We were on a train the other day, and it threw us around so much it felt like one of those rides at Universal Studios theme park.''</p>
