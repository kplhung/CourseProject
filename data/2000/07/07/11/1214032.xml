        <p>In a concession to local concerns about the behavior of American soldiers stationed in Okinawa, the United States military has indefinitely banned the drinking of alcoholic beverages between midnight and 5 a.m. and prohibited its personnel from leaving their bases during those hours.</p>
        <p>The curfew was imposed after a hit-and-run accident involving a staff sergeant stationed at the United States Air Force's Kadena Air Base early Sunday morning. A pedestrian was injured in the accident and the sergeant was later caught. The authorities investigating the accident said it appeared that alcohol was involved.</p>
        <p>This latest incident follows an apology from the highest-ranking United States military official in Okinawa after a marine was arrested last week for allegedly entering a house and molesting a 14-year-old girl while she was sleeping.</p>
        <p>''The goal of this policy is to enhance discipline among service members and prevent the recurrence of liberty incidents,'' the military said in a statement today.</p>
        <p>Japanese officials have asked the  military to take steps to address the problem of crimes committed by its servicemen, an issue that has long bedeviled relations between local residents and the government of the prefecture and between the prefecture and the central government. ''The fact that another incident of this sort has occurred at a time when we were already seeking tighter official discipline is regrettable,'' said the chief cabinet secretary, Hidenao Nakagawa, during a regularly scheduled news conference.</p>
        <p>The two most recent alleged crimes occurred at a particularly sensitive time for the Japanese government, which is doing its utmost to ensure that the Group of 8 summit meeting of world leaders scheduled for July 21 through July 23 in Okinawa will come off without a hitch.</p>
        <p>Police forces around the country have been staging drills in preparation for any trouble that might occur, and the national government has been working feverishly to end a dispute with the United States trade representative over charges imposed by the dominant telephone carrier.</p>
        <p>The incidents have also embarrassed the United States. President Clinton's participation in the summit meeting will be the first visit by an American president since the United States returned Okinawa to Japan in 1972, and last week Japan was treated to the sight of Lt. Gen. Earl B. Hailston of the United States Marine Corps, the highest-ranking American officer here, bowing deeply to the prefecture's governor in a striking display of contrition.</p>
        <p>About 26,000 of the 48,000 American military personnel in Japan are stationed in Okinawa, and residents of the island have long complained that they are unfairly burdened with the social and economic costs of that situation.</p>
