        <p>Venus Williams kept pointing at the clock, and Serena kept taking her time. But once the sisters arrived at the champions dinner Sunday night, they shimmered in perfect harmony.</p>
        <p>''I was stunning,'' Venus Williams said.</p>
        <p>''I passed by a mirror, and I was like, 'Whoa,' '' Serena added.</p>
        <p>It seems Venus and Serena Willams do not have daily affirmations; they have them hourly.</p>
        <p>Together, the queens of self-esteem exited the All England Club today after adding the doubles title to the singles championship Venus Williams won Saturday. And in their eye-catching wake, they left some of the best players in the world searching their pockets for some confidence.</p>
        <p>''Just for us to come back like this, I can only imagine what people are thinking,'' said Serena Williams, who, like her sister, missed most of the spring because of injury. ''Obviously, they're probably going to go home and practice harder. But you know what? We are, too. We come at it really serious. And we mean business.''</p>
        <p>In one fortnight, Venus Williams bludgeoned the instinctive talents out of Martina Hingis's game and then overwhelmed Lindsay Davenport's power with her own.</p>
        <p>After missing two months with a knee injury, Serena Williams came to the All England Club without a warm-up match. But she dropped only one service game in four rounds, took less than hour to dismantle most of her opponents and discovered the only obstacle in her journey to the title was her big sister in the semifinal.</p>
        <p>As a seal of proof to their dominance, they won their doubles match after being awakened by a phone call at 8:30 this morning. It was their mother calling from Florida, but Venus Williams admitted that she was too groggy to be coherent.</p>
        <p>''I was somewhat in a coma,'' said Venus Williams, who had fallen asleep at 2 a.m. after the champions dinner. ''I couldn't think, so I said, 'I've got to call you back.' I haven't spoken to her since.''</p>
        <p>Just four hours after the wake-up call, Venus and Serena Williams walked out on Center Court to play their rain-delayed doubles championship title.</p>
        <p>Almost in their sleep, the unranked wild-card entrants into the competition defeated Julie Halard-Decugis and Ai Sugiyama, 6-3, 6-2, for the title. After the sisters embraced at the net, they held up the trophy to provide one last Wimbledon snapshot of their invincibility.</p>
        <p>''It's getting pretty scary,'' Venus Williams said of their dominance, ''but we like it.''</p>
        <p>The rest of the Tour seems a bit unsettled by their surge. Hingis once had the genius to defuse any opponent's power. Two years ago, her confidence was unrivaled and her cunning was her ally. When her body was stretched to its limit and her will was worn down, Hingis's spirits were broken after her semifinal loss to Venus Williams.</p>
        <p>''It used to be enough just with my abilities I had at the time,'' Hingis said. ''It has changed so much since the Williamses started playing better. I guess as the No. 1, you're supposed to win a Grand Slam. But now someone else probably deserves to be No. 1.''</p>
        <p>That's the goal of the Williams sisters, both of them. Whatever tension existed when Serena had a Grand Slam title and her big sister did not, it seems to have been diluted by Venus's victory at Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>''We're both even again,'' Venus said. ''Now, we're both going for our second one.''</p>
        <p>As they sat side by side in an interview room today, they were very straightforward when asked about their plans for the immediate future. ''To win the U.S. Open,'' Venus said.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, for me too,'' Serena chimed in.</p>
        <p>The competition between them has the potential to leave everyone else drifting like satellites around their world if they ever reach their goal of becoming No. 1 and No. 2. What once seemed far-fetched is not such a wild idea anymore.</p>
        <p>''We're both going to try and get as many wins as we can,'' Venus Williams said.</p>
        <p>''We're really greedy,'' Serena Williams added.</p>
        <p>This is how they were all day. Venus Williams would answer a question, then her little sister would tag along in response.</p>
        <p>When asked who would star in the sisters' home-designed tennis newsletter, Venus looked at Serena to cue her reply.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be about Wimbledon, and what I think happened this year,'' Serena Williams said. ''Pete Sampras won his 13th Grand Slam, and I don't know, I think Venus might get the cover story. That was a pretty big happening.''</p>
        <p>''I have pull,'' Venus said.</p>
