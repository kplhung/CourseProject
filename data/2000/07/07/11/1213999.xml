        <p>A common antibiotic that has been around for decades may help people who suffer from Huntington's disease, a debilitating hereditary ailment.</p>
        <p>Although researchers emphasized that much study remained to be done, they said the drug, minocycline, a relative of tetracycline, did much to slow the course of the disease in mice.</p>
        <p>''It's not a cure,'' cautioned Dr. Robert M. Friedlander of Brigham and Women's Hospital, who described his findings in the current issue of Nature Medicine.</p>
        <p>But use of the drug prolonged the lives of the mice by 14 percent, Dr. Friedlander said.</p>
        <p>Huntington's disease is characterized by involuntary movement of the limbs and cognitive problems. Some 30,000 people have it, while another 150,000 are at risk of inheriting it.</p>
        <p>Researchers believe the drug may help stop production of two enzymes -- caspase -1 and -3 -- associated with Huntington's.</p>
        <p>Dr. Friedlander said he got the idea to try the antibiotic after reading about Finnish scientists who used it to help people who had had strokes, in which the caspase enzymes also appear to play a role.</p>
        <p>He said his study suggested that minocycline could also help with other diseases, including Alzheimer's.</p>
