        <p>Deutsche Telekom, the German telecommunications company that has been seeking a merger partner in the United States, has added another possibility to its list, making preliminary overtures to the VoiceStream Wireless Corporation, a person close to the companies said yesterday.</p>
        <p>No deal is imminent, the person said, especially because Deutsche Telekom is exploring several options. The company covets a wireless network in the United States and has talked to almost every major player, including Qwest Communications International and the Sprint Corporation.</p>
        <p>Talks between Qwest and Deutsche Telekom faltered earlier this year and Sprint, for its part, agreed to be acquired by WorldCom Inc. last year. The Sprint and WorldCom combination, though, is being opposed by the Department of Justice and will most likely be called off, perhaps as early as this week. If so, many analysts think Deutsche Telekom would be the logical buyer of Sprint.</p>
        <p>That does not mean that Deutsche Telekom has limited its options. Executives of the companies could not be reached last night for comment.</p>
        <p>VoiceStream Wireless, based in Bellevue, Wash., is a nationwide wireless phone carrier with a market value of more than $26 billion. The company operates with a technology known as global system for mobile communications, or G.S.M., which is the dominant system in Europe and much of the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom has been repeatedly mentioned as the company most likely to go after Sprint. But that possibility has worried Senate leaders, who say they would oppose such a deal on the grounds that it might violate a law preventing the Federal Communications Commission from transferring radio licenses to companies that are more than 25 percent owned by foreign governments.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom, once Germany's state-owned telephone monopoly, is now publicly listed. But the German government still owns 57 percent of its stock.</p>
