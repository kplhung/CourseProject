        <p>When Eli Segal started three years ago to round up corporations to hire welfare recipients, many of his C.E.O. friends scoffed. Experts told him that only about a third of the recipients were ready for steady work, the rest untrained, undisciplined or worse. Today Mr. Segal's group -- The Welfare to Work Partnership -- has grown from 5 companies to 12,000. They have hired more than 650,000 welfare recipients, a huge bite out of the welfare rolls that has helped shrink them to about 2.5 million adults.</p>
        <p>Among the heroes in this story are the nonprofit neighborhood groups to which the partnership turned to help recruit, train and screen welfare applicants. The local groups took much of the risk and fear out of hiring welfare enrollees. The partnership's goal was to make hiring from the welfare rolls profitable, therefore self-sustaining. It succeeded. Corporate members of the partnership report that welfare hires stay on the job longer than their ordinary hires, cutting down retraining costs.</p>

        <p>When Eli Segal started three years ago to round up corporations to hire welfare recipients, many of his C.E.O. friends scoffed. Experts told him that only about a third of the recipients were ready for steady work, the rest untrained, undisciplined or worse. Today Mr. Segal's group -- The Welfare to Work Partnership -- has grown from 5 companies to 12,000. They have hired more than 650,000 welfare recipients, a huge bite out of the welfare rolls that has helped shrink them to about 2.5 million adults.</p>
        <p>Among the heroes in this story are the nonprofit neighborhood groups to which the partnership turned to help recruit, train and screen welfare applicants. The local groups took much of the risk and fear out of hiring welfare enrollees. The partnership's goal was to make hiring from the welfare rolls profitable, therefore self-sustaining. It succeeded. Corporate members of the partnership report that welfare hires stay on the job longer than their ordinary hires, cutting down retraining costs.</p>
        <p>The partnership's record has disproved many pessimistic predictions, made after passage of the welfare law in 1996, that welfare recipients would be unemployable or confined to low-skilled retailing jobs. In fact, Chase Manhattan and other financial service behemoths have absorbed thousands of recipients. So have United Airlines, Xerox and companies in other high-paying industries. In 1997 Mr. Segal predicted he would have to twist the arms of corporate C.E.O.'s to get them to hire from the welfare rolls. But, with mighty help from an economy that cut the unemployment rate in about half, corporations now come to Mr. Segal desperate for  applicants.</p>
        <p>''The hardest to hire turn out to be not so hard to hire,'' says Gerald Greenwald, former chairman of United Airlines. C.E.O.'s started out as skeptics, he recalled. ''Now we are the optimists.''</p>
