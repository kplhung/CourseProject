        <p>THE cartoonist, were we drawing him, would be full body and partly turned away, the shoulders protectively hunched, the eyes downcast, and, as the cartoonist is Ben Katchor, rendered with a gray wash. We have a genuine New York literary creature here, but not a gadabout in a white suit who is amusing over cocktails; rather a lugubrious, thoughtful, shaggy creature, wooed out of his blinds-drawn Upper West Side workroom (there can be no natural light, only artificial, the light must be consistent) into his living room.</p>
        <p>It will not be a surprise, speaking with him, to find that what he likes to do for fun is to be idle, but for now, we must deal with his great honor.</p>

        <p>THE cartoonist, were we drawing him, would be full body and partly turned away, the shoulders protectively hunched, the eyes downcast, and, as the cartoonist is Ben Katchor, rendered with a gray wash. We have a genuine New York literary creature here, but not a gadabout in a white suit who is amusing over cocktails; rather a lugubrious, thoughtful, shaggy creature, wooed out of his blinds-drawn Upper West Side workroom (there can be no natural light, only artificial, the light must be consistent) into his living room.</p>
        <p>It will not be a surprise, speaking with him, to find that what he likes to do for fun is to be idle, but for now, we must deal with his great honor.</p>
        <p>So, the MacArthur Foundation grant you've just been given, the so-called genius award, $500,000: that's pretty good  (subtext: especially for an arcane, dark, alternate-press guy like yourself). That's a lot of money.</p>
        <p>''It's taxable,'' Mr. Katchor says, taking the air out of that talk balloon.</p>
        <p>A pause, which is part of the conversation with him, then:</p>
        <p>''Yeah, it's a lot of money, but it's just the sort of back cushion if one year I don't get enough of a book deal or don't do enough lectures.''</p>
        <p>He studies his hands, fingers fiddling with fingers. ''I mean, uh, it's not something you, uh, set out to get in any way. A few weeks ago with this opera'' -- an Off Broadway production based on his work -- ''we won an Obie, that felt like I put all this work into the project. There was a logical connection. This thing is like out of the blue.''</p>
        <p>Pause.</p>
        <p>''Like getting hit by a truck or something. An accident. But a good accident.''</p>
        <p>Can there be cartoons that are both funny and Hopperesque? These are the works of Mr. Katchor, 48, whose work runs locally in the English-language edition of The Forward, and the architecture and design magazine Metropolis, and which have been collected into several books (''Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer''; ''The Jew of New York''). In the words of the MacArthur Foundation, ''An ironic, compelling and bittersweet nostalgia for the detritus of city life.''</p>
        <p>The landscape of Mr. Katchor's strips is a gray-toned city resembling New York, particularly the grimy, under-the-bridge, industrial sections of the city. His heroes -- thickish, lumpen, their bodies cast forward against the perpetually adversarial universe -- are small-time businessmen or artists in doomed enterprises: a man who wants to carbonate Lake Erie, a ''radiator musician'' who performs steam lullabies on apartment radiators and whose career is shattered when a warm spell causes the boiler to be turned off.</p>
        <p>THE best known is Julius Knipl, the middle-aged and mustachioed man in a fedora, who wanders the streets, observing; a man, Mr. Katchor says, somewhat like himself.</p>
        <p>''The replacement son'' is the phrase Mr. Katchor sometimes uses to describe himself. You might also think of him as the displaced son, for his father, a Warsaw Jew who left Poland at the beginning of the 20th century, was old enough to be his grandfather.</p>
        <p>The elder Mr. Katchor had been, either of necessity or spirit, a wanderer, who had emigrated first to Palestine, then to Brazil, then to Saratoga, N.Y., where he had ''a combination Communist hotel and chicken farm.'' He has a son, Morris, who enlists in the Army during World War II and is killed, as are most of Mr. Katchor's family in Poland. The father trades the chicken farm for a small apartment building in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where his new son, Ben, grows up.</p>
        <p>''He might have been a character in a Knipl strip, this utopian Socialist landlord,'' Mr. Katchor says, languorously, which, with his long pauses, gives you the not unpleasant feeling of sitting in a pigeon-grubby park on a hot and enervating day in some bygone New York neighborhood, perhaps in one of Mr. Katchor's strips. ''We lived in his building and he had a scheme to sort of make them into communes, like an urban kibbutz.''</p>
        <p>Dreamy pause.</p>
        <p>''All kinds of strange schemes. He had this apparatus to ventilate chicken coops that he was going to bring to Cuba and the Soviet Union. Schemes. They were never realized.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Katchor grows up drawing comics, graduates from Brooklyn College with a major in painting, sets up a typesetting and graphic design company with two friends on John Street in Lower Manhattan. It is here the world of small-business men, the world that becomes the inspiration for Knipl, becomes known to him.</p>
        <p>''People coming in to have business cards or menus or sticks for the back of wristwatches that say 14-karat gold.'' A little smile. ''Twenty-four-karat gold. Things like that. You'd go out in the evening and see all this stuff you'd printed thrown away in the street.'' Fondly, sadly, for he knows what they represent.  ''All this paper ephemera.''</p>
        <p>In 1988, Mr. Katchor sells his first strip, Knipl, to The New York Press, a weekly. He is paid $75 a strip. Today, Mr. Katchor owns a two-bedroom apartment, teaches a class at the School of Visual Arts, is syndicated in a dozen papers. The opera, ''The Carbon-Copy Building,'' ran for 10 days last fall.</p>
        <p>He has been married ''about 15 years'' to Susan Taube, a former schoolteacher. As befitting an urban talmudicist, he found her at the B.&amp; H. Dairy on Second Avenue, sitting at the counter. It was she who started the conversation.</p>
        <p>''She asked me what I was eating and she knew very well what I was eating. I was eating gefilte fish.''</p>
