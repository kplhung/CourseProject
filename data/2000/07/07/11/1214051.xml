        <p>An Offer That Could Be Refused</p>
        <p>A one-page memo and eight single-spaced pages of ''talking points'' -- paragraphs that could be used in speeches supporting HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate -- were sent to at least two New York Republicans last week.</p>

        <p>An Offer That Could Be Refused</p>
        <p>A one-page memo and eight single-spaced pages of ''talking points'' -- paragraphs that could be used in speeches supporting HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate -- were sent to at least two New York Republicans last week.</p>
        <p>STATE SENATOR ROY M. GOODMAN, the Manhattan Republican chairman, and ASSEMBLYMAN JOHN A. RAVITZ, the Republican whip in the State Legislature, said the document landed in their fax machines on Thursday morning.</p>
        <p>The memo outlined plans for ''surrogate speaking''; that is, arranging for Mrs. Clinton's supporters to appear before audiences when she cannot do so.</p>
        <p>''We will be developing a centralized database of all potential surrogates (elected officials, Democratic activists, celebrities, other supporters),'' the memo said. ''As we get the database up and running, we will be asking surrogates to start covering some of the backlog of events we have here in Hillary scheduling.''</p>
        <p>The talking points included sections headed ''Hillary will strengthen and preserve Social Security and Medicare,'' ''Hillary will lower skyrocketing prescription drug costs'' and ''Hillary supports the right gun safety legislation for New York.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman said that he was ''struck by the graciousness of the invitation'' to be a surrogate speaker for Mrs. Clinton, ''and by the inappropriateness of sending it to the Republican county chairman in Manhattan.'' He also said that he had sent Mrs. Clinton's campaign a thank-you note. ''Please feel free,'' he wrote, ''to continue to send me anything you think may be of interest so that I may adequately analyze your candidate's positions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ravitz said, ''Obviously, whoever is calling the shots doesn't understand there is a two-party system in New York and there are some Republican officials in New York.'' A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign said there had been a fax-machine mixup, and not the first of the campaign. ''Last week, Rick Lazio sent us a fund-raising letter,'' said the spokeswoman, KAREN DUNN, ''so we thought we'd try to sway them.''</p>
        <p>Another Starr, Another Clinton</p>
        <p>KENNETH W. STARR, the former independent counsel who recommended the impeachment of President Clinton, spent several hours yesterday at New York University, where he has been an adjunct professor at the law school for eight years, ''long before you-know-what,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He commented after appearing on a panel that analyzed the Supreme Court term that ended last week. His daughter CAROLYN, who will be a junior at Stanford University in the fall, was in the audience.</p>
        <p>''I think she was less interested in hearing Dad and more interesting in seeing friends who are at N.Y.U. for the summer,'' Mr. Starr said. ''Funny how that works. I don't think I was the draw. In fact, I know I was not. I was an excuse, and I picked up the tab for the shuttle ticket.''</p>
        <p>His daughter, who is majoring in English and art history, entered Stanford in 1998, a year behind the president's daughter, CHELSEA. So had they ever run into each other on campus? ''I don't want to get into that aspect of it,'' Mr. Starr said.</p>
        <p>Belgian Homage</p>
        <p>There was Belgian beer. Belgian chocolate. Belgian cheese. Belgian lace. And the Belgian ambassador to the United Nations, ANDRE ADAM; the Belgian consul general in New York, INGEBORG KRISTOFFERSEN; and a Belgian pop star, MICHELINE VAN HAUTEM. Belgian television was taping it all.</p>
        <p>But the event was in Cooperstown, N.Y., where some 2,000 beer lovers and Belgium worshipers gathered for a two-day festival that ended Sunday adapted from a 450-year-old Brussels tradition, complete with beer toasts, falconry and mock 16th-century costumes.</p>
        <p>Why Cooperstown, the epicenter of baseball?</p>
        <p>Because it is also the home of Brewery Ommegang, a three-year-old maker of Belgian-style beers that is a Belgian-American joint venture.</p>
        <p>''The real ambassador,'' Mr. Adam said, ''is the beer.''</p>
