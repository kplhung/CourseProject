        <p>The managers of the All-Star teams announced their lineups today for Tuesday night's game, and seven of the 16 names were different from those voted as starters by the fans.</p>
        <p>Injuries have knocked three players out of the American League lineup -- shortstop Alex Rodriguez, third baseman Cal Ripken, outfielder Manny Ramirez -- and four out of the National League lineup -- first baseman Mark McGwire, catcher Mike Piazza and outfielders Ken Griffey Jr. and Barry Bonds.</p>

        <p>The managers of the All-Star teams announced their lineups today for Tuesday night's game, and seven of the 16 names were different from those voted as starters by the fans.</p>
        <p>Injuries have knocked three players out of the American League lineup -- shortstop Alex Rodriguez, third baseman Cal Ripken, outfielder Manny Ramirez -- and four out of the National League lineup -- first baseman Mark McGwire, catcher Mike Piazza and outfielders Ken Griffey Jr. and Barry Bonds.</p>
        <p>Skeptics may question the severity of the injuries, but Bonds said today: ''They're legit injuries. I saw Mark McGwire. He's hurt. There's no question about it. Alex Rodriguez, how many stretchers or ambulances do you need to prove that the guy had a concussion? Mike Piazza, the whole world saw that. Everyone knows I have a broken thumb. What more evidence do you need?''</p>
        <p>Bonds, Rodriguez and Griffey came to Atlanta even though they can't participate. Bonds said the injured players were upset that they wouldn't be able to play.</p>
        <p>''In reality,'' the San Francisco left fielder said, ''we're all teed off because we don't have a chance to play. We don't know how to handle this because we haven't been in the situation before. We're at a worldly event and can't do anything about it.''</p>
        <p>Bonds added that the injured players couldn't afford to take a chance on playing. ''The intensity level between the two sides is high,'' he said. ''I don't want to lose to the American League.''</p>
        <p>Named to replace the injured players in the starting lineups were Derek Jeter for Rodriguez, Travis Fryman for Ripken, Carl Everett for Ramirez, Andres Galarraga for McGwire, Jason Kendall for Piazza, Jim Edmonds for Griffey and Vladimir Guerrero for Bonds.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez called all the injuries a freak development. ''Piazza and I get a concussion two days before the All-Star Game,'' he said. He said he preferred to look at the situation as a break for the players who have replaced the injured stars.</p>
        <p>Citing Mike Bordick, the Baltimore shortstop, who replaced him on the A.L. roster, Rodriguez said: ''I said to Bordick, 'I'm very happy you're here. You deserve to be here. It would be a shame not to be here.' ''</p>
        <p>Sosa's Soap Opera</p>
        <p>Sammy Sosa said today ''it's not about the money.'' His relationship with the Chicago Cubs, that is. But the more Sosa spoke, the more confusing his position became.</p>
        <p>Sosa, on the other hand, left no confusion later in the evening. Unleashing am awesome array of mammoth blasts, he easily won the All-Star home run contest, beating Ken Griffey Jr. in the final round, 9 to 2. Griffey's sore knee will prevent him from playing in the game, but the Cincinnati Reds told him he could defend his contest title.</p>
        <p>The Cubs recently tried to trade Sosa to the Yankees but failed when the Yankees wouldn't give them all of the players they wanted for the slugging outfielder. Sosa's agents met with club officials Sunday and, seeking some semblance of serenity for the rest of the season, told them not to try to trade him because he would use his rights to block a deal.</p>
        <p>Sosa, who has a year and a half remaining on his contract, said today he would like to sign an extension with the Cubs, but they haven't made him a proposal.</p>
        <p>Asked why they should offer him an extension now rather than after the season, he said:</p>
        <p>''Just because I believe I belong in Chicago. I just want to see where my future is. I'm going to be a free agent next year and have the right to do whatever I want. I don't want to go through that process. Everything I've done in a Chicago Cub uniform, I think I deserve something like where my future is. That is one of the reasons why my agent and I made a decision to go up there and say we want an extension now.''</p>
        <p>In saying it's not about money, Sosa said, ''I've been willing to do anything to stay with the Cubs.'' But he wouldn't say if he would take less money to remain with them than he might be able to get elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''I still believe I'm going to stay in Chicago,'' he said. ''I still believe they're going to take care of me.''</p>
        <p>Why does he believe that?</p>
        <p>''Because I believe it. If it's not going to happen, what can you do?''</p>
        <p>At another point, he said, ''I always say I want to stay in Chicago, but if it's not going to work out for me, if I'm not going to see a future in Chicago, maybe the best way is to move to another place.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what's going to happen. I'm going to wait till the end of the year and see what happens.''</p>
