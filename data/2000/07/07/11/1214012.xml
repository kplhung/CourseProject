        <p>Like plywood, a conch shell is stronger than its parts.</p>
        <p>The spiral-shaped shell is 99 percent aragonite -- a mineral made of calcium, carbon and oxygen -- but is up to 1,000 times as tough as pure aragonite. For creatures desiring to eat the conch, that is a formidable fortress to breach.</p>
        <p>The strength comes from nature's evolutionary engineering and could inspire stronger ceramics.</p>
        <p>''There are, we believe, valuable lessons to be learned in the design of materials from the evolutionary processes that have taken place,'' said Dr. Arthur Heuer, a professor of materials science and engineering at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.</p>
        <p>In the June 29 issue of the journal Nature, researchers led by Dr. Heuer and Dr. Roberto Ballarini, a professor of civil engineering at Case Western, described in detail the shell of the queen conch, which lives in the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>To the naked eye, a chip of conch shell looks unremarkable. ''You would think it was a homogenous piece of chalk,'' Dr. Ballarini said.</p>
        <p>With high-power electron microscopes, the view is more intricate. The shell consists of layers of rods of aragonite that crisscross at right angles.</p>
        <p>''I like to think of it as ceramic plywood,'' Dr. Heuer said.</p>
        <p>Like wood, each shell layer, about a 25th of an inch thick, cracks easily when bent along the direction of the rods, the equivalent of along the grain of wood, but it is very strong when bent in the perpendicular direction, the equivalent of against the grain of wood.</p>
        <p>The layered crisscross structure strengthens the shell in all directions. When the shell is bent, tiny cracks accumulate within individual layers, but the cracks do not propagate all the way through -- and the shell stays in one piece. ''It doesn't fail,'' Dr. Heuer said, ''and that's not a bad definition of a tough material.''</p>
        <p>Unlike plywood, though, each aragonite rod is, in turn, also reinforced.</p>
        <p>''One big rod is made of a bunch of smaller rods,'' Dr. Ballarini said, ''and the smaller rod is made of even smaller rods, which is made out of even smaller rods.''</p>
        <p>A protein secreted by the conch -- the remaining 1 percent of the shell -- glues the rods together.</p>
        <p>If ceramics could be made as tough as conch shells, they would find new uses in combustion engines, furnaces, body armor and other applications for which they are now too brittle.</p>
        <p>But the layered, crisscross structure is not easy to mimic, because of the wide range of rod sizes.</p>
        <p>''The hard part would be producing such structures in cost-effective ways,'' Dr. Ballarini said.</p>
