        <p>A suburban Boston father charged with manslaughter in the fatal beating of another father over rough play at a youth hockey game pleaded not guilty today, as sports officials and psychologists suggested that the incident reflected a rapid growth in parents' violent acts at children's athletic events.</p>
        <p>Behind that rise in such violence during recent years, the experts say, are more involvement by fathers and mothers in their children's sports, greater pressure to see their offspring win athletic scholarships or big-money professional contracts, and a tendency to overidentify with the children, who, the parents hope, will become the sports stars they themselves never were.</p>
        <p>In the case here, Thomas Junta, a 42-year-old truck driver with no previous criminal record, turned himself in to the police today and was released on $5,000 bail in Woburn District Court. Manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment in Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Junta's court appearance followed by five days the assault on the 40-year-old victim, Michael Costin, at a hockey rink in Reading, north of Boston. Martha Coakley, the Middlesex County district attorney, said Mr. Costin's death had resulted from a ''wanton and reckless assault and battery.'' There is no evidence that the two men knew each other, she said, and no ''indication of an intent to kill.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Costin was beaten after a pickup hockey game where he had been on the ice monitoring play. Mr. Junta, watching from the stands, shouted at him, demanding that he stop some body checking and fighting that the police said involved the two men's 10-year-old sons. Mr. Junta, who is 6-foot-2 and 275 pounds, initially assaulted Mr. Costin, 5-11 and 170, as he left the ice, the authorities said, and then, after being ordered out by a rink manager, returned and slammed Mr. Costin to the ground beside a soda machine.</p>
        <p>That blow to Mr. Costin's head as he hit the concrete floor apparently caused brain death almost instantly, Ms. Coakley said, but Mr. Junta pushed his knee into Mr. Costin's chest and continued to pummel him in the head.</p>
        <p>Whatever the root causes that led the events of last Wednesday to spin so badly out of control, the death of Mr. Costin and the charging of Mr. Junta (pronounced ZHUN-tah) touched off talk by experts about parental overinvolvement in children's athletics.</p>
        <p>''This is just the tip of an iceberg,'' said William Pollack, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School who is an authority on father-son relationships. Professor Pollack said reports of assaults by parents at youth sports events ''have gotten much worse'' in the last 5 to 10 years, and  statistics show that the number of injuries in youth sports is also sharply up during the same period, a result at least in part, he said, of parents' encouraging their children to play more aggressively.</p>
        <p>Bob Still, a spokesman for the National Association of Sports Officials, which represents 19,000 umpires and referees in professional as well as high school and youth sports, said his organization had seen a sharp increase in reports of violence by parents at sports events in the last three or four years.</p>
        <p>''We get two or three reports of this kind of behavior a week,'' Mr. Still said in an interview from his group's headquarters in Racine, Wis. ''There is definitely a trend.''</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Still said, he received a report that a coach, the father of a player, had broken the jaw of a 13-year-old umpire at a Little League game in Davie, Fla., because he did not like a call.</p>
        <p>And last year a mother in Virginia slapped a 14-year-old official and knocked him to the ground because she disagreed with a call during a soccer game, Mr. Still said.</p>
        <p>It has reached the point, he said, where the association offers its members assault insurance and provides legal advice to those attacked.</p>
        <p>Sports officials and psychologists agree that there are several likely causes of increasing parental violence.</p>
        <p>Fred Engh, founder and president of the National Alliance for Youth Sports, a nonprofit organization in West Palm Beach, Fla., that works to promote fun and safety in athletics, said the first cause was ego. ''It's not the kid at bat,'' he said, ''it's the parent,'' who is living vicariously through his child.</p>
        <p>A second factor, Mr. Engh said, is greed. ''So many parents today are saying, 'My child is going to get some of that money, the millions of dollars in professional sports or a college scholarship,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>Leonard Zaichowsky, a professor of sports psychology at Boston University, who grew up playing hockey in Alberta, Canada, said one importnat change was the sheer increase in parental involvement in sports. ''When I was growing up, parents were minimally involved,'' he said. ''Kids rode their bikes or walked to games, and they settled things themselves. Now parents drive the kids to practice and games, and as things have gotten more organized, the stakes are higher.''</p>
