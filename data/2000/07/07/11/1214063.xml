        <p>A half-century before Marion Jones, the greatest female track-and-field athlete was Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands, whose four gold medals at the 1948 London Olympics set a record that Jones will try to break with five at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Just as significant as Blankers-Koen's medals were the cultural barriers she hurdled, the barriers that said women should not compete in anything as vigorous and sweaty as track and field, that they were unwomanly if they did, that they would not be able to have children or would not succeed in sports as mothers, that their careers would be or should be washed up long before the age of 30.</p>
        <p>She would not consider herself a feminist -- she admitted to crying and wanting to leave the London Games because she missed her two young children so fiercely -- but Blankers-Koen stood as an important bulwark against the capsizing discrimination female athletes experienced then, and to a lesser agree, today.</p>
        <p>Last year, she was named by track and field's world governing body as the sport's top female athlete of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>''I was 30 in London, and people said I was too old, that it was not good to be running if you had a baby, that you should do the housekeeping rather than running in shorts in a stadium,'' Blankers-Koen, now 82, said yesterday from her home in Hoofddorp, the Netherlands, outside of Amsterdam. ''They were not used to it, but I was not listening to them. I did what I wanted to do.''</p>
        <p>Her Olympic career actually began as an 18-year-old at the 1936 Berlin Games, when the unmarried Fanny Koen finished tied for sixth place in the high jump and participated on a Dutch relay team that took fifth. She did meet Jesse Owens in Berlin, marveled at his four gold medals, got his autograph and even had a drink with him.</p>
        <p>''I thought it must be nice to have just one medal,'' she said.</p>
        <p>World War II intervened, however, and the Summer Games were shelved for 12 years. She remained in the Netherlands during the war, Blankers-Koen said, obtaining food from an uncle who had a farm, thankful just for surviving, never thinking about training for the Olympics. Finally, the Summer Games were renewed in London in 1948. By then, she had married her coach, Jan Blankers, and was the mother of a 7-year-old boy, Jan, and a 2-year-old daughter, Fanny.</p>
        <p>Societal bias against female athletes was withering. Babe Didrikson and other track athletes had been allowed to enter only three events at the 1932 Los Angeles Games. Officials were so alarmed by the exhausted conclusion of the 800-meter race at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics that women would not be permitted to run longer than 200 meters again until the 1960 Rome Olympics. Not until 1984 would a women's marathon be added to the Summer Games.</p>
        <p>Athletes who were mothers faced the accusation that they were unfit parents whose place was in the home, not the homestretch. Blankers-Koen ignored the complaints. She began competing again when her daughter was 6 months old, taking her to meets around Europe, carrying her in a little basket, breast-feeding in the locker room.</p>
        <p>''I asked my doctor about taking up sport and he said, 'You are breast-feeding, but try it,' '' Blankers-Koen recalled. ''I had more and more food for the girl than before.''</p>
        <p>Of the nine track and field events held for women at the London Games, she won four -- the 100 meters, 200 meters, 80-meter hurdles and the 4x100-meter relay. Her time in the hurdles, which have since been extended to 100 meters, was an Olympic-record 11.9 seconds. Before the 200 meters, she said she began crying, telling her coach/ husband that she wanted to return home to see their children, who were staying with her parents.</p>
        <p>''It is not necessary for me that you are running,'' she said he told her. ''But if you don't run, I'm sure you will be sorry for it later on.''</p>
        <p>She remained in London, set an Olympic record of 24.3 seconds in the 200-meter semifinal, won the final in 24.4, then anchored the Dutch relay to her fourth gold medal, taking the baton in fourth place and crossing the finish line first. She would undoubtedly have won a fifth gold medal, considering that the winning distance in the long jump was 22 inches shorter than her world record of 20-feet 6 1/4 inches, but Blankers-Koen skipped the event because it conflicted with the 200 meters.</p>
        <p>''My husband said it was better to win one gold medal than two silvers,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Blankers-Koen's long-jumping ability was so extraordinary that Jones's first attempt this season -- 52 years later -- was only three-quarters of an inch farther at 20-7. The two have met once, and will undoubtedly meet again when Blankers-Koen travels to Sydney to watch Jones try to eclipse her record for gold medals. ''I told her she should win more medals than I did,'' Blankers-Koen said. ''She can do so many things.''</p>
