        <p>Citing frequent encounters with rats on his porch at Gracie Mansion, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced the formation of a new city task force yesterday to examine ways to control the rodent population in New York City.</p>
        <p>''Rats are horrible,'' Mr. Giuliani said, recalling the uninvited visitors to his porch with its East River views during recent summers.</p>
        <p>''When you see them, no matter how immune you are to anything or how brave you think you are, the rats get you really scared. They can bite you, they can spread disease and they are frightening animals.''</p>
        <p>The creation of the task force comes after reports in recent weeks of intense rat infestation problems in Rego Park and at the Baruch Houses on the Lower East Side public housing project.</p>
        <p>The city, Mr. Giuliani said, is looking for new ways to intensify the battle. City Councilman Bill Perkins, a Manhattan Democrat who held a recent hearing on the problem, said one step could be to appoint a ''rat czar'' to coordinate how city agencies respond to sightings. Mr. Perkins and Councilman Stephen J. Fiala, a Staten Island Republican, have also proposed legislation that would require developers to exterminate rats before starting construction projects.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani encouraged city residents not to expect too much.</p>
        <p>''It is unrealistic to think you are not going to have rats,'' the mayor said, before adding, without hesitation, that ''you should not have as many as we have.''</p>
