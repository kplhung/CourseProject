        <p>Patrick Henry, whose trial in 1977 for killing a 7-year-old boy helped lead to abolition of the death penalty in France, has been refused parole.</p>
        <p>In his original trial, Mr. Henry had a passionate young lawyer who put the guillotine on trial instead. In the end, Mr. Henry got a life sentence and, soon after, France abolished the death penalty altogether.</p>
        <p>Lately, Mr. Henry has been back in the headlines, at the heart of a new debate over whether someone who has committed such a heinous crime can be rehabilitated.</p>
        <p>Now 46 years old, Mr. Henry says he is a changed man and he has mustered all kinds of supporters. When France's justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou, started considering the case last month she indicated that she might act in his favor. Today she said no.</p>
        <p>In a brief statement today turning down the request, her office said that she had done an ''in depth'' study of the case, asking for ''numerous opinions'' before making her decision.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the case underscores how far the country has come in 20 years and how much the eye-for-an eye notions of punishment have been replaced by a debate over the uses of incarceration and the best ways to rehabilitate criminals, even those convicted of a horrible crime.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Henry's lawyers in 1977, Robert Bocquillon, said yesterday that he was convinced that Mr. Henry had completely remade himself in prison, earning his baccalaureate, a mathematics degree and a degree in computer programing. He has a job waiting for him when he gets out.</p>
        <p>But by refusing to parole him, Ms. Guigou, a socialist, can avoid what is still a difficult political decision. Polls indicated that French citizens were, though by only a slight margin, still opposed to his release.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henry kidnapped Philippe Bertrand, 7, from outside of his school, strangled him and took the body to a room he had rented. He wrapped the body in a blanket and stuffed it under the bed. Within hours, he called the boy's parents and demanded a ransom of one million francs, which they could not pay. During the search for the boy, Mr. Henry even appeared on national television saying people who kidnap children deserve death.</p>
