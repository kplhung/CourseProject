        <p>A few years ago, 13-year-old Drew Williams's asthma was so severe, he could not even go to a movie. Once a fleck of dog dander, a remnant from a pet-owner who previously had his seat, sparked an attack. At school in Dillon, Colo., Drew's desk had to be far from classmates who owned furry animals. And that was despite high doses of asthma medications he took every morning</p>
        <p>to open his airways.</p>
        <p>Today, taking a new experimental treatment, called anti-IgE, Drew can go anywhere he wants without fear that he will stop breathing.</p>
        <p>The anti-IgE shots changed his life, Drew said. ''Before, I was on tons and tons of medication.''</p>
        <p>Still, he added, ''If I touched a dog, I'd be rushed to the hospital. Now I can't really pet dogs, but I can toss them a ball.''</p>
        <p>Drew is among 2,000 severe asthmatics participating in trials of anti-IgE, one of a new class of treatments aimed at preventing allergy and asthma attacks. The treatments, still experimental, are aimed at stopping the attacks at their source. Most treatments simply treat the symptoms.</p>
        <p>For nearly 80 years, scientists have known about the antibody IgE or immunoglobulinE, which is one of five kinds of antibodies that fight foreign substances. IgE is the one that reacts against allergens causing hay fever and other allergic reactions. But only recently have scientists considered using it for therapy. Shaped like the letter Y, IgE has two tails that hang freely and one that sticks to mast cells. When an allergen enters the body of a susceptible person, it sticks to one of the free ends of IgE, prompting the antibodies to link together. This cross-linking, in turn, provokes the mast cells to spew its substances -- cytokines, leukotrienes and histamines -- that cause itchy eyes and clogged airways. The anti-IgE shots are made of a substance that blocks IgE right where it attaches to the mast cell, foiling the chemical cascade.</p>
        <p>Other new treatments block a cytokine or one kind of leukotriene.</p>
        <p>Dr. Peter Barnes, an expert on allergies  at the National Heart and Lung Institute in London, said the encouraging news was that the shots seemed to be working for severe asthmatics, while other new approaches had a limited effect because they were too specific. For instance, a drug that blocks one kind of leukotriene may prevent blocked airways but have no effect on itchy eyes.</p>
        <p>The hope is that this new family of treatments will be effective and lead to fewer side effects than oral steroids, which are used to treat patients with severe disease. Chronic use of oral steroids can stunt growth in children and lead to brittle bone disease and high blood pressure.</p>
        <p>So far, a few small studies suggest that patients getting anti-IgE shots once or twice a month suffer fewer flare-ups and need less medication. Some patients are weaned off other drugs completely.</p>
        <p>The results of two small random trials, in which half the participants got the treatment and the rest a placebo, were presented at the American Academy of Asthma and Immunology in San Diego in March. One study included 334 asthmatic children ages 6 to 12. About 55 percent of those who got the shots no longer needed the inhaled steroids, compared with 39 percent of those who got a placebo. Another study of 525 adults found that those who got real treatment, rather than a placebo, suffered fewer asthma attacks: 21.3 percent versus 32.4 percent.</p>
        <p>These results confirm an earlier report, published in December in The New England Journal of Medicine. In that study 314 patients continued with their steroid treatment and in addition got either high-dose anti-IgE, low-dose anti-IgE or a placebo. Asthma symptoms, like chest tightness or wheezing were reduced by 42 percent among the high-dose group, 40 percent in the low-dose group, and 30 percent in the placebo group. Anti-IgE is being developed by Genentech, Novartis Pharma AG and Tanox, but it has not received approval.</p>
        <p>Anti-IgE could have a major impact, said Dr. Henry Milgrom, one of the investigators at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver., a leading lung disease hospital. But, he said: ''I am reluctant to paint too rosy of a picture. There is confirmation that has to come before you can draw firm conclusions.''</p>
        <p>Other experts said the notion of allergy medication aimed at the immune system was exciting, but they added that they were waiting for the results of large trials to  ensure the drugs were effective and had few side effects.</p>
        <p>Dr. Allan Weinstein, an internist in Washington and the author of ''Asthma: The Complete Guide to Self-Management of Asthma and Allergies'' (Ballantine, 1989), said: ''The greatest concern is that while the death rate for so many diseases has dropped, it has not budged for asthma. This treatment, if proven effective in large studies, could be particularly useful for those with difficult-to-manage disease.''</p>
        <p>Drew said he was grateful that he stuck with the study. ''In the beginning when they told me it was shots twice a month, it was a little scary,'' he said. ''But once I started, it wasn't so bad. And now I can play without having to take extra medicine. It used to be running to first base would take it out of me and I'd reach for my inhaler. Now I can play baseball without worrying. I can really do anything I want.''</p>
