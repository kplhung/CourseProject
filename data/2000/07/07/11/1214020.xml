        <p>Genius at Work  What's in a middle name? If it happens to be Amadeus, then the answer is: music by Mozart and lots of it. The sixth annual Amadeus Festival, featuring Zdenek Macal and the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra and performances in Newark and Princeton, begins tonight and ends on July 29, featuring guest artists like the violinist Pamela Frank, the pianists Ruth Laredo and Vladimir Feltsman and the husband-and-wife pianists Misha and Cipa Dichter. Peter Schickele, the musician, composer and conductor who gave the world PDQ Bach, will usher in the festivities at 7:30 in Prudential Hall at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark with a special performance of some of his favorite works under the title ''A Little Nightmare Music.''</p>
        <p>Africa Portrayed  Rituals of birth and initiation, courtship and marriage, changing seasons, wealth and royalty, all recorded in photographs taken in 30 years of travel through Africa, go on display on Friday at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. In addition to the 95 large-scale photographs by Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher, the museum will exhibit 40 objects, including masks and jewelry, mostly from its own extensive collection. ''Passages: Photographs in Africa by Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher'' continues through Sept. 24.</p>
        <p>Right This Way  With the New York premiere of the musical revue ''Reading Rainbow,'' based on the Emmy Award-winning PBS children's series that encourages reading, Theatreworks/USA will begin its 12th season of free summer theater on Thursday. The site is the Sylvia &amp; Danny Kaye Playhouse on East 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues. ''Reading Rainbow,'' recommended for children 4 and up, comprises eight short stories adapted for the stage from popular children's books. It plays through July 29.</p>
