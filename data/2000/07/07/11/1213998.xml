        <p>The next time a doctor wants to take a blood sample from your thumb, tell him to stick it in the ear.</p>
        <p>The idea here is not to encourage impoliteness but to reduce pain. Reporting in The British Medical Journal, a group of doctors in England said they had determined that taking a blood sample from the ear lobe instead of the thumb was less painful.</p>
        <p>Doctors measuring glucose levels conducted an experiment on 60 patients. Thirty were lanced on the side of the thumb (a technique adopted over the years when doctors realized that the area was less sensitive than other digits), while the rest were lanced on the ear lobe. The wound was then squeezed to force out a drop of blood.</p>
        <p>Patients were then asked to assess the pain using a standard technique, and the results clearly favored the ear lobe, the study said.</p>
        <p>The reason was unclear. The doctors theorized that the density of pain receptors in the ear lobe might be lower than in the thumb. But they also said further research was needed into the effect of repeated ear lobe punctures on patients who require frequent glucose screening.</p>
