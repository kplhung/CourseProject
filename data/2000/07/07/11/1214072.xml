        <p>A fierce pressure campaign by New York City's largest union of janitors has caused a major loss of business for one of the city's largest nonunion cleaning companies.</p>
        <p>As a result of the union's pressure tactics, Citibank, Cooper Union and several large office buildings have dropped the cleaning company, Golden Mark Maintenance, in favor of unionized cleaning contractors.</p>
        <p>Officials with Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union hailed their successes against Golden Mark, noting that unionized janitors earned about $15 an hour with extensive benefits, compared with the $6.50 to $7 an hour and scant benefits offered by Golden Mark.</p>
        <p>The union has pressured building owners to drop Golden Mark by picketing outside buildings and by holding meetings with the owners, arguing that it was next to impossible for janitors to live in New York on $6.50 an hour.</p>
        <p>''We went directly to the owners and said they had some responsibility to pay these people decent wages and not hire contractors who paid people so poorly,'' said Michael Fishman, the trustee who runs Local 32B-32J.</p>
        <p>The union local represents 55,000 cleaners, doormen and elevator operators in New York office towers and apartment buildings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fishman said some building owners and cleaning contractors had told union officials that Golden Mark had been put on the defensive to the extent that it had indicated to them that it might abandon the Manhattan cleaning market.</p>
        <p>But David Weissman, a lawyer for Golden Mark, denied that the company had any plans to withdraw from the cleaning business in Manhattan, although he acknowledged that it had lost a lot of business because of the union.</p>
        <p>He said that Golden Mark, of Inwood, N.Y., was studying the filing of a lawsuit to accuse the union of engaging in illegal methods to take away the company's business. He said the company might specifically accuse the union with tortious interference of contractual relations.</p>
        <p>''We are losing accounts due to what we believe are illegal tactics by 32B-32J,'' he said. ''They've looked to maliciously and tortiously interfere with Golden Mark with the express intention of putting them out of business.''</p>
        <p>Union officials denied that they did anything improper or illegal, saying that union members had picketed and otherwise exercised their free-speech rights to pressure building owners to drop Golden Mark.</p>
        <p>Among the buildings that have dropped Golden Mark, union officials said, are the Louis Vuitton building at 19 East 57th Street; 61 Broadway in the Financial District; 360 Lexington Avenue, near 41st Street; and the Brooklyn Renaissance Plaza.</p>
        <p>The biggest victory for the union was persuading Citibank to award its 135 Golden Mark jobs to a unionized contractor. The union estimates that  it has persuaded building owners to award 200 Golden Mark jobs to unionized contractors. That, these officials estimated, represents a third to a half of the company's jobs.</p>
        <p>James F. Berg, president of the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, an association of building owners and managers, said Local 32B-32J's success resulted from its becoming far more aggressive under the trusteeship.</p>
        <p>In February 1999, the parent union placed the local into trusteeship and ousted Gus Bevona, the longtime president, who did little organizing and was known for his high salary and luxurious penthouse.</p>
        <p>''Obviously,'' Mr. Berg said, ''the union has become much more active and vocal in combating this type of operation and in campaigning against low wages paid by nonunion companies.''</p>
        <p>The union's campaign against Golden Mark is part of a plan to unionize more than 20,000 janitors in New York and New Jersey in the next three years.</p>
