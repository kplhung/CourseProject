        <p>Vice President Al Gore took a new tack in his presidential campaign today, beginning a series of broadsides against the Republican-controlled Congress and seeking to align Gov. George W. Bush, his Republican rival, with antipopulist stands that he says are a result of the control of Congress by special interests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore repeatedly branded Congress with a mouthful phrase -- the ''do-nothing-for-the-people Republican Congress'' -- in an effort to sharpen the differences between him and Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''Let's face it. Never has so little been done, in so much time, to benefit so few,'' the vice president said, pointing to Congress's failure to pass legislation he favors, like raising the minimum wage, protecting the environment, making drugs cheaper for the elderly and strengthening gun control laws.</p>
        <p>''It is time for the Congress to listen to the people and not the powerful,'' Mr. Gore said, speaking in an incongruously soft voice to about 300 people in the ornate auditorium of Central Connecticut State University. ''It's time for them to do something instead of doing nothing. I've heard from people all over this country who can't wait for them to work up the gumption to come out from under the thumb of the special interests.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said that Congress, in which he served for 16 years, was controlled by big oil, big drug companies, big insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and that Mr. Bush, who has so far largely sidestepped association with Congressional Republicans, was doing the bidding of these industries.</p>
        <p>''Governor Bush, who is now head of the Republican Party, says nothing about this,'' Mr. Gore said, ''and his silence aids and abets the do-nothing Republican-led Congress and the same special interests who are contributing so much to his own campaign: the H.M.O.'s, the insurance companies, the pharmaceutical companies, the oil companies and the big polluters.''</p>
        <p>In essence, Mr. Gore was trying to lump Congress with institutions that, polling shows, people love to hate.</p>
        <p>The venue he chose to open up this  scorching of the Republican leadership was a blue-collar region of Connecticut that is represented in Congress by a Republican, Nancy L. Johnson. Connecticut, which voted for President Clinton and is home to two Democratic senators, is considered a toss-up state, a bad sign for Mr. Gore, whose strongest region should be the Northeast, the most liberal and reliably Democratic part of the country.</p>
        <p>A recent poll by the Hartford Courant and the University of Connecticut showed the two candidates in a statistical dead heat, with Mr. Gore winning 45 percent of the vote and Mr. Bush, who has family roots here, with 43 percent.</p>
        <p>G. Donald Ferree Jr., director of the poll, said in an interview that Mr. Gore appeared to be falling back on the strategy of attacking big institutions because he was having a hard time overcoming the perception that Mr. Bush was more likable and was stronger on personal matters like leadership and credibility.</p>
        <p>''Going after Bush personally is not working and may not seem fair,'' Mr. Ferree said. ''The less Gore focuses on personality, the better for him. It's better for Gore not to treat him as a person but to treat him as a front for the Republicans. The Congress is impersonal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has been trying to frame the race as a dramatic ideological choice, between his own moderate, centrist views and those of a candidate who would be following the dictates of the right wing, especially with nominations of Supreme Court justices who would oppose abortion.</p>
        <p>The Gore camp has long believed that the vice president would win the election because the positions he held were more carefully crafted to public opinion than those of Governor Bush. Mr. Gore has spent much of the spring fine-tuning his positions and is now on a mission to make the public aware of his differences with Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Working to Mr. Gore's advantage, his supporters contend, is that his positions meld with those of most Democratic officeholders. While Republicans are splintered along numerous fault lines, the Democrats are speaking with more or less one voice, the exception being trade.</p>
        <p>Today, that message was delivered by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate and who introduced Mr. Gore here.</p>
        <p>''I am here to fight to protect Connecticut's voters from deceptive politics,'' Senator Lieberman told the audience. ''Don't let yourself be cheated by Republican offers that sound good but don't deliver. Don't let yourself be cheated by statements that seem centrist but in the end end up on the fringes, that talk the compassionate talk but, believe me, I've looked at the details, simply do not walk the compassionate walk. Al Gore is the real thing.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''In Stevie Wonder's words, Al Gore is singing in the key of life.''</p>
        <p>Before his speech today, Mr. Gore took part in an online discussion with readers of The Washington Post.</p>
        <p>He was asked what effect the results of the recent failed test of the proposed national missile defense system had on his opinion of the  necessity of its deployment.</p>
        <p>He said he still favored the missile system, adding: ''The failure of the test last Friday night doesn't mean that such a system is impossible to build, although the specific lessons from the failure will have to await a more thorough analysis.''</p>
        <p>He was also asked why he supported the death penalty.</p>
        <p>''I support it for particularly heinous crimes because I believe there are some offenses for which it is just,'' Mr. Gore responded. ''I know that many feel it does not really have a deterrent effect, but I think it probably does.''</p>
