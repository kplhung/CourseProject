        <p>A reunion of Diana Ross with members of her former group, the Supremes, was canceled yesterday, according to a statement released by Ms. Ross.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for SFX, the concert promoter, disputed Ms. Ross's statement, saying the company had not yet decided to cancel the reunion. He said that dates in Wantagh, N.Y.,  Washington and Pittsburgh had been canceled but the rest of the tour, which is scheduled to end in Las Vegas on Aug. 5, would continue.</p>
        <p>The reason for the talk of cancellation, according to executives in the concert business, was poor ticket sales in many cities. Premium seats for the show were priced as high as $250 and, with the exception of Ms. Ross, the reunited group did not include members from the Motown group's heyday in the 1960's. Although the group's concert at Madison Square Garden on July 6 was sold out, in most other cities concert halls have been only half full. Even with poor ticket sales, it is rare for such a highly promoted tour to be canceled midway through its run.</p>
        <p>Bob Grossweiner, a concert-industry analyst, saw the dispute as a standoff over Ms. Ross's high guarantee, reported to be from $15 million to $20 million. If the promoter cancels the tour, he said, it will still be obligated to pay her the full amount. ''There has never been a tour bought by a national promoter that's done as bad as this one and had a clash over money like this one,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The reunion has been followed by criticism since its beginning. It was first announced in April, when SFX bought the rights to what was billed as the first reunion in three decades for the group. But the surviving former Supremes Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong declined to join, saying they were being offered much less than Ms. Ross. Instead, two members who sang in the group three years after Ms. Ross left, Lynda Laurence and Scherrie Payne, completed the trio. From the beginning, however, tickets sold slowly, and some concerts were postponed to give more time for ticket sales.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the first times that from the first press conference, a tour had bad press,'' Mr. Grossweiner said. ''Mary Wilson went on national TV and blasted the tour. So you had all this negativity coming in and high ticket prices and an audience that was confused. Plus, it was essentially a Diana Ross show, because she didn't interact with the other women.''</p>
