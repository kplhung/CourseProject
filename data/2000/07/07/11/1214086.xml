        <p>The federal government sued yesterday to prevent toysmart.com, a bankrupt Internet toy retailer, from selling its database of customer information, asserting the company had assured hundreds of thousands of online visitors that their personal data would never be shared with a third party.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Federal Trade Commission said toysmart.com, in trying to sell the database among the company's assets, has compromised not just names, addresses and shopping preferences of online toy shoppers, but potentially also family profile information, including names and ages of children. Toysmart.com, which is majority owned by the Walt Disney Company, ceased operations in May and began soliciting bids for its assets.</p>

        <p>The federal government sued yesterday to prevent toysmart.com, a bankrupt Internet toy retailer, from selling its database of customer information, asserting the company had assured hundreds of thousands of online visitors that their personal data would never be shared with a third party.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Federal Trade Commission said toysmart.com, in trying to sell the database among the company's assets, has compromised not just names, addresses and shopping preferences of online toy shoppers, but potentially also family profile information, including names and ages of children. Toysmart.com, which is majority owned by the Walt Disney Company, ceased operations in May and began soliciting bids for its assets.</p>
        <p>The suit has added to the debate over online privacy, and about whether Internet retailers should be subject to government regulation limiting how they handle and protect customer information. Internet retailers assert they can regulate themselves by disclosing on their sites whether and how they might use customer data accrued when visitors join sites or make purchases.</p>
        <p>Privacy advocates said the toysmart.com case raised significant questions. The privacy advocates and commission officials say that online companies that amass large and potentially valuable customer databases might have little incentive to adhere to privacy assurances once they go out of business, are bought or merge.</p>
        <p>''As a shakeout of dot-com companies occur, they can't sell out customer lists they promised to protect like they do other assets, like paper clips or computer equipment,'' said David Medine, associate director of financial practices, the division of the F.T.C. that filed the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Officials from toysmart.com, based in Waltham, Mass., could not be reached for comment. The company's bankruptcy lawyer, Harry Murphy, said the two sides were in settlement discussions and he said he was very hopeful a settlement would be reached. Officials from Disney, which holds three of five board seats, released a statement saying they ''favor an outcome that honors the commitments contained in the toysmart privacy policy,'' but they declined to be specific about whether that might preclude the sale of the information.</p>
        <p>Mr. Medine also said he was optimistic the two sides could reach an agreement. Parties close to the negotiations said a settlement might permit toysmart.com to sell the customer database but only in the event that the buyer essentially took over the toysmart.com business as a whole and continued to use it as part of a similar online toy retailer.</p>
        <p>''If there are appropriate protections, there could be room for transferring the list as part of the overall company,'' Mr. Medine said.</p>
        <p>That might not be the case under a law proposed on Monday. Representative Spencer T. Bachus, Republican of Alabama, introduced legislation on Monday that would make it an unfair business practice, subject to civil penalties, if an online business promises it will not divulge customer information, then seeks to sell it, including in the case of merger or bankruptcy, Mr. Bachus said.</p>
        <p>Toysmart.com announced on May 22 that it was closing operations and selling its assets. The decision came despite the fact that the company was ranked 24th among most-visited sites in December, with 1.4 million visitors, according to Media Metrix, which measures site traffic, Federal Trade Commission officials said. On June 8, the company took out an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal offering the sale of both tangible and intangible assets, including ''databases and customer lists.'' A day later, the company filed for bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>On June 29, the advertisement came to the attention of Truste, a nonprofit agency that certifies the privacy policy of online retailers. Toysmart.com was among roughly 2,000 sites, including major online search engines, that have received Truste's seal of approval.</p>
        <p>David Steer, a spokesman for Truste, said, however, that toysmart.com's move to sell information was  in clear violation of the company's policy, which states that ''Personal information, voluntarily submitted by visitors to our site, such as name, address, billing information and shopping preferences, is never shared with a third party.'' The notice continues, ''You can rest assured that your information will never be shared with a third party.''</p>
        <p>''They're hiding under a veil of bankruptcy to hoodwink their customers,'' Mr. Steer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steer said he asked the F.T.C. to look into the company, along with  other Internet companies that he had heard might be trying to sell customer databases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steer and other privacy advocates said the recent failures of Internet companies put newfound urgency into the debate over how companies handle customer information. ''Given the current state of the e-commerce industry, we are likely to see this happen again and again as companies try to sell assets to stay afloat,'' he said.</p>
