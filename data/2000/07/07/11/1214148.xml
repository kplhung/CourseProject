        <p>Thirty-two horses burned to death yesterday in a barn fire in northern Westchester County, the police said.</p>
        <p>The barn, at Breakaway Farms, a boarding stable in North Salem, caught fire around 5:15 a.m. and quickly burned to the ground with the horses trapped inside, said Trooper Thomas Libretti of the State Police barracks in Somers.</p>
        <p>The fire is still being investigated, but the authorities believe that faulty wiring may have been the cause, Trooper Libretti said.</p>
        <p>The owners of Breakaway Farms, situated on the Oakbrook estate on Route 121, about 50 miles north of New York City, leased the barn and rented stable space to many private owners, Trooper Libretti said.</p>
        <p>''Some were show horses, some were jump horses, some were just children's horses,'' the trooper said.</p>
        <p>It was the second major fire in a horse stable in the New York region in little over a month. On June 9, 21 horses died in a blaze that gutted the Bergen Beach Stables in Brooklyn.</p>
