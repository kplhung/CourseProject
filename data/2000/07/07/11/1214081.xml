        <p>The flood of advertising that has carried newspaper company profits to record earnings over the last year continued almost unabated in the second quarter for both The New York Times Company, whose net income increased 21.8 percent, and the Gannett Company, whose profit increased 13 percent.</p>
        <p>The Times Company posted net income of $101.7 million, or 59 cents a share, compared with $83.5 million, or 47 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Excluding special items, profit in the period a year earlier was $85.8 million, or 48 cents a share.</p>
        <p>Revenue jumped 13.6 percent, to $885.6 million from $779.4 million. Excluding figures from The Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette in Massachusetts, which the company acquired in January, revenue rose 10.9 percent.</p>
        <p>The results beat analysts' estimates by 3 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.</p>
        <p>Gannett reported net income of $265.8 million, or $1 a share, compared with profit from operations of $234.8 million, or 84 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 16 percent, to $1.49 billion from $1.28 billion. In the quarter a year earlier, a gain of $33 million, or 11 cents a share, related to an exchange of television stations in Texas and California, and profit of $9.4 million, or 3 cents a share, from discontinued cable operations made net income $277 million, or 98 cents a share.</p>
        <p>Gannett's results matched Wall Street expectations, according to First Call.</p>
        <p>For the Times Company, excluding results at The Telegram &amp; Gazette, advertising revenue increased 14.3 percent, to $564 million, fueled by a 16.5 percent increase in advertising revenue at The New York Times and 14.8 percent at The Boston Globe. Including The Telegram &amp; Gazette, advertising revenue was $580 million, up 17.2 percent.</p>
        <p>At New York Times Digital, the company's Internet division, revenue grew to $13.5 million from $5 million, while operating losses rose to $15.5 million from $4.6 million. The company attributed the increased losses to higher staff and promotion costs associated with Abuzz Technologies Inc., which the company acquired last year.</p>
        <p>The Times Company has registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue a stock tracking the results of New York Times Digital and has won shareholder approval, but it has not set a date for the offering.</p>
        <p>William Drewry, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, said the Times Company results exceeded expectations ''by a very, very comfortable margin.''</p>
        <p>''That's been the trend and will probably continue to be the trend,'' he added, saying that he expected increases in the price of newsprint -- a newspaper's biggest cost outside of labor -- to be manageable.</p>
        <p>Gannett's results were announced amid a large-scale expansion at the company, which has over the last year bought two newspaper companies in Britain, 21 daily newspapers from Thomson Newspapers Inc. and, most recently, Central Newspapers Inc., the publisher of The Arizona Republic and The Indianapolis Star.</p>
        <p>For the second quarter, Gannett's newspaper advertising revenue increased 21.4 percent, to $957 million.</p>
        <p>But Michael Beebe, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs, said that some analysts had been concerned by a one-month ''softness'' in advertising in June at the company's flagship newspaper, USA Today. ''What they attributed it to was softness in travel and retail categories in particular due to tough comparisons -- due to some advertisers taking a midyear pause,'' Mr. Beebe said. ''That's what spooks investors. We don't now how long this pause may last.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Drewry said: ''Gannett's numbers were good. The market was disappointed that they didn't show an upside surprise. The stock's being punished for that. But they have a lot of upside potential for the next few quarters, given their acquisitions.''</p>
        <p>Shares of Gannett fell $1.875 yesterday, to $57.0625, while shares of the Times Company rose 93.75 cents, to $40.9375.</p>
