        <p>MANHATTAN: PARK ROBBERY SUSPECT -- A suspect in five robberies at gunpoint in Central Park was arrested Sunday evening after a chess player in the park recognized him from a wanted poster, the police said yesterday. The suspect, Reinaldo Joseph, 38, of Brooklyn, was charged with robbery and criminal possession of a weapon in connection with three robberies in the park since April. Investigators said Mr. Joseph was the leading suspect in two other robberies as well. In all the robberies, women in their 20's were approached by a man with a gun as they walked in the park.</p>

        <p>YONKERS: HOSPITAL CONTRACTS -- New York's largest health care union canceled picketing scheduled for yesterday at two hospitals in Yonkers, St. John's Riverside and Yonkers General, after negotiating its first contract with them. The contract covers nearly 1,000 workers and raises the salaries and benefits of registered nurses and others to the levels of their New York City counterparts. The contract, negotiated by 1199, New York's Health and Human Service Union, raises wages for the lowest-paid workers to $12.86 an hour from $7.75 over four years.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: BOND RATING RAISED -- Standard &amp; Poor's, the Wall Street rating agency, raised its credit rating for the New York State Thruway Authority's bonds to AA- from A yesterday, noting that the state is dedicating more revenues to the trust fund that backs the bonds. The authority is selling $458 million in bonds, and under the state's new transportation capital program, it plans to spend more than $17 billion over the next five years on highway and bridge construction, railroad and aviation projects, and maintenance.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: ''IRAN 10'' PROTEST -- Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, left, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, joined a group of New York politicians at a rally near the United Nations yesterday calling for the immediate release of the so-called Iran 10, the 10 Jewish men sentenced to prison on espionage charges in Iran after a long, closed trial. ''We must allow our anger to speak,'' Mr. Wiesel said.</p>

        <p>SYRACUSE: FRATERNITY LAWSUIT -- A federal judge has ruled that Hamilton College did not violate antitrust laws by requiring students to live on campus and not in fraternity houses. Judge Norman Mordue of United States District Court found that ''there is no genuine issue as to any material fact'' in the 1995 antitrust case, and ordered that it be dismissed in a decision rendered on June 29. The fraternities sued the college in Clinton under the Sherman Antitrust Act, arguing that the college was a monopolist in providing services to students.</p>

        <p>EXTRADITION HEARING AWAITED -- Kathryn Gannon, a former star of X-rated films who is wanted in the United States on insider trading charges, will wait two more weeks to learn the date of her extradition hearing. Ms. Gannon, 31, appeared briefly in a court in Vancouver, British Columbia, yesterday as her lawyer asked for a delay in the hearing on whether she will be sent to New York to stand trial. Justice Patrick Dohm scheduled a July 25 court appearance. Ms. Gannon, known as Marylin Star in X-rated movies and publications, was arrested in May. She was charged in December along with James McDermott Jr., the former chief executive of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods.</p>

        <p>GALLOWAY TOWNSHIP: IDENTIFICATION SOUGHT -- The police say they are asking for help in identifying a woman who has been comatose since she attempted suicide on June 29 at a Days Inn in Galloway Township, outside Atlantic City. The woman is black, 5 feet 5 inches tall, about 250 pounds and thought to be in her 40's or 50's. The police said she has a one-inch lesion above her left eyebrow and a scar under her chin. A Bible, bifocal glasses and clothing with the label ''Teddi'' were found in her room. She carried a bus schedule for a route from New York City to Cape May.</p>

The injured were being treated for smoke inhalation and respiratory problems, the authorities said.

        <p>BRISTOL: NEW PARK RULES AFTER DROWNING -- Lake Compounce, the amusement park in Bristol, has tightened safety regulations for a popular water slide after the drowning of a 6-year-old boy who met the ride's height requirement but could not swim. On July 1, the boy, Devon M. Alexander of Hartford, slipped off the inner tube that he had ridden down the 375-foot-long slide and spent 25 minutes underwater before lifeguards found him. He died on Friday. Under the tighter rules, life jackets will be required for children between 46 inches and 56 inches tall.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: BLOOD SUPPLY CRISIS -- Connecticut has a blood emergency, Red Cross officials said. While no elective surgery has been canceled because of the shortage, patient transfusions may be jeopardized if the blood supply continues to fall, said Dr. Richard Cable, acting executive director of the Connecticut Region of the American Red Cross. Red Cross officials said Sunday that 1,746 donors were needed for three-day supply of blood.</p>
