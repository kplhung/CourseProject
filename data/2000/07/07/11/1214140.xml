        <p>Stunned by the political drama in Israel, the Clinton administration tried today to put the best face on prospects for the Camp David summit meeting despite Prime Minister Ehud Barak's weakened position. The administration said Mr. Barak still had sufficient popular support to reach an agreement with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, and sell it back home.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, who called the summit meeting after a series of requests by Mr. Barak, praised Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak as leaders who had the ''vision, the knowledge, the experience and the ability and the sheer guts to do what it takes.''</p>

        <p>Stunned by the political drama in Israel, the Clinton administration tried today to put the best face on prospects for the Camp David summit meeting despite Prime Minister Ehud Barak's weakened position. The administration said Mr. Barak still had sufficient popular support to reach an agreement with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, and sell it back home.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, who called the summit meeting after a series of requests by Mr. Barak, praised Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak as leaders who had the ''vision, the knowledge, the experience and the ability and the sheer guts to do what it takes.''</p>
        <p>Even so, the administration had not expected that Mr. Barak would arrive for the summit meeting's start on Tuesday depending for his political survival on the parliamentary votes of Communist and Arab parties. There was also surprise among officials here that Foreign Minister David Levy, apparently piqued at not being included in the prime minister's inner circle, refused to make the trip.</p>
        <p>The slide in Mr. Barak's fortunes  occurred as administration officials packed their bags to go to Camp David and the surrounding Maryland hills. Some officials added last-minute touches to talking points as the no-confidence vote unfolded in the Israeli Parliament. Much of the State Department's press operations moved to a school near Camp David.</p>
        <p>There were preparations, too, to welcome Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat and their teams of negotiators, limited to about 12 on each side. Mr. Barak was accompanied by, among others, Shlomo Ben-Ami, a popular Labor Party politician.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat headed for Washington with a team that represents a wide spectrum of the Palestinian Authority's political thinking. His chief negotiator is Abu Ala, head of the Palestinian assembly in Ramallah and a veteran of the secret Oslo negotiations in 1993.</p>
        <p>But almost all the focus today was on Mr. Barak, who was widely referred to as a top-flight soldier but a less than top-flight politician. Describing the reaction to Mr. Barak's tumultuous day in Jerusalem, one official said, ''This was like lightning on a clear day.''</p>
        <p>Turning a seeming negative into a positive, a senior administration official argued that Mr. Barak's predicament ''underscored that the prime minister is willing to take the political heat for moving forward.'' That would in turn let Mr. Clinton convince Mr. Arafat that the prime minister was the ''best'' Israeli leader with whom to deal, because few other politicians would be as willing to risk their position and offer compromises, the official said.</p>
        <p>In pushing aside the perception of the prime minister's weakness as he arrived -- an expected 12 hours later than planned because of the no-confidence vote -- the official said the White House was firm in its view that Mr. Barak had the resolve to complete an agreement.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said this morning that Mr. Barak enjoyed the support of more than 55 percent of Israelis and would hence be able to go to the people with an agreement.</p>
        <p>But Israeli opinion surveys are quite fickle, an administration official said, adding that it was a thin reed to hang the future of a yet-to-be-negotiated agreement on polling.</p>
        <p>Diplomats in the region and Middle East experts appeared to be in consensus that the chances had diminished for an overall end-of-conflict accord that the White House would like. One experienced diplomat in the region said Mr. Barak would have to fight for the toughest terms he could, because any agreement would be portrayed as a sellout by the right wing in Israel. At the same time, the diplomat said, Mr. Arafat would see that the Israeli was ''desperate'' for an accord and would toughen his conditions.</p>
        <p>The administration has left itself various possibilities for claiming success. In announcing the meeting last week, Mr. Clinton said he wanted an agreement on the ''core issues'' that have fueled the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for more than 50 years. But he also set a slightly lesser goal, saying the meeting would be where the two leaders would ''start drawing the contours of the long-awaited peace,'' a phrase that seemed to indicate that a deal on some general principles might also be enough.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is scheduled to leave for Okinawa, Japan, on July 19 for a summit meeting in of leading industrial economies. He said today he did not want to set an ''artificial deadline'' for the talks.</p>
