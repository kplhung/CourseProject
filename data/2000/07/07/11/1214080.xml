        <p>Developers pitching projects as varied as the expansion of an Astoria film studio to the construction of a large shopping center in East Harlem ranked among the biggest spenders last year on New York City lobbyists, according to a report released yesterday.</p>
        <p>Since the start of the Giuliani administration in 1994, spending on the lobbyists who try to influence elected city officials and bureaucrats has jumped 33 percent. The report, by the New York Public Interest Research Group, examined the record $12.7 million spent last year to determine what kind of benefits the companies were hoping to gain.</p>
        <p>Instead of focusing on city budget matters or legislation before the council on topics like A.T.M. surcharges or smoking, the study found, 10 of the 14 companies with lobbying tabs exceeding $100,000 concerned themselves at least in part with real-estate projects.</p>
        <p>''We knew New York is a real-estate town, but we were surprised at the extent that real-estate interest dominated the list of the city's biggest spenders on lobbying,'' said Neal Rosenstein, the author of the report.</p>
        <p>The top spender, Blumenfeld Development Group of Long Island, spent a total of $265,916 on three lobbyists: Rubenstein Associates, a Manhattan public relations agency; Kathy Zamechansky &amp; Associates, a Bronx community relations firm; and the Manhattan- law firm Wachtel &amp; Masyr.</p>
        <p>These lobbyists had dealings with former Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine, the city planning director, Joseph B. Rose, Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern, the Manhattan borough president's Office, Community Boards 8 and 11, and at least three city council members, among other city officials, Mr. Rosenstein said, citing records filed with the city.</p>
        <p>The focus of these efforts, said Jesse Masyr, a partner at Wachtel &amp; Masyr, was the $160 million East River Plaza shopping center project, slated to replace the long-dormant Washburn Wire Factory along the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in East Harlem.</p>
        <p>''This is a project that is enormous in scope,'' Mr. Masyr said, explaining the large lobbying bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Masyr said most of his firm's time was spent handling intricate, noncontroversial details of the land-use review, work that qualifies as lobbying in New York City. But a share of it, he added, was directed at building support for the project, which required City Council approval.</p>
        <p>George H. Weldon, owner of the Weldon Funeral Home at 116 Street near First Avenue and an opponent of the East River Plaza project, said yesterday that the well-financed effort was difficult to counter.</p>
        <p>''New York is a place of money, and whoever has the money to spend on the lobbyists and politicians will win out over the residents,'' said Mr. Weldon, citing concerns over automobile traffic as the reason for his opposition. ''We did not have any resources to oppose them.''</p>
        <p>Councilman Bill Perkins, one of the Manhattan Democrats listed as a focus of the Blumenfeld lobbying effort, said he did not remember meeting with a lobbyist before last year's Council vote. But he said would not be surprised if such a meeting occurred and he agreed that lobbying by developers can make a difference.</p>
        <p>''They have a serious advantage over the average constituent,'' said Mr. Perkins, who ended up supporting the project. ''They will take you out, they will make a better presentation, they will recruit people from the community to back the plan.''</p>
        <p>But ultimately, it is the substance that matters, Mr. Perkins said. ''If they can make the case on the merits and it is in tune for what you think is important for the community, then it can be very influential,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Among other the companies with real estate interests that spent heavily on lobbyists last year were Forest City Ratner of Brooklyn, Kaufman Astoria Studios of Queens and the Home Depot chain, which has been developing new stores in Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan. Kaufman Astoria is spending $8.3 million to add a seventh studio.</p>
        <p>The biggest share of Forest City Ratner's $236,744 lobbying related to the new Brooklyn courthouse the company is building for the city at 330 Jay Street, a project worth about $350 million, as well as to the expansion of the Atlantic Center shopping mall in downtown Brooklyn, said Michele de Milly, president of Geto &amp; de Milly, a government relations company in Manhattan that received $96,000 from Forest City Ratner.</p>
        <p>The list of companies that hired lobbyists includes many that were interested in legislation before the City Council, budget matters or other city government initiatives. Others were pursuing tax breaks from the city.</p>
        <p>The Greater New York Hospital Association spent $170,456 on matters that included funds for AIDS programs and an effort under way in New York City to move one million city Medicaid patients into managed care plans, the report says. The National Association of Securities Dealers, which spent $123,796, worked to win tax incentives in return for moving more employees to the city, said Steven P. Polivy, a senior partner at Stadtmauer Bailkin, a law firm paid $123,796 to represent the association.</p>
