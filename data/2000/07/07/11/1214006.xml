        <p>Roses From Seed</p>
        <p>Q.  Can I grow a rose from seed? How long would it take?</p>
        <p>A.  With patience, a rose can be grown from a seed, and indeed all the Peace roses of today are descended from a plant grown in 1939 from a single seed nurtured by Francis Meilland, the hybridizer. But a random seed from a Peace rose or any hybrid would be unlikely to produce a plant like the one it came from.</p>

        <p>Roses From Seed</p>
        <p>Q.  Can I grow a rose from seed? How long would it take?</p>
        <p>A.  With patience, a rose can be grown from a seed, and indeed all the Peace roses of today are descended from a plant grown in 1939 from a single seed nurtured by Francis Meilland, the hybridizer. But a random seed from a Peace rose or any hybrid would be unlikely to produce a plant like the one it came from.</p>
        <p>As for the time it would take, a wild, unhybridized rose like Rosa rugosa would be relatively quick and easy to grow from seed, with little preparation; in the early fall, remove the seeds from the ripe rose hips, the fruit of the rose, and plant them.</p>
        <p>For many other roses, however, the seeds must be refrigerated for about four weeks at about 40 degrees, for what gardeners call stratification, a cold period, and again for about four months, at a somewhat higher temperature, for germination, with a light on in the refrigerator. They can be nurtured in moist peat moss.</p>
        <p>Before sprouting, seeds can be tested for viability by seeing if they float in water. Floaters are hollow and unlikely to germinate.</p>
        <p>The sprouts from the refrigerated seeds can be planted, preferably in sterile soil, perhaps with a cut-off plastic bottle as a greenhouse. If they survive, they may produce miniature roses in just a couple of months, previews of the color of mature roses, but not their shape. The plants and their roses should reach full size in about three years.</p>
