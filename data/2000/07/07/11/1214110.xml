        <p>Peter Caprio of Union, N.J., the 70-year-old leader of the Bruno family's so-called North Jersey crew, pleaded guilty in United States District Court here to a single count of conspiracy dating from the 1970's to last March.

        <p>The head of a Philadelphia crime family's operations in northern New Jersey admitted today to conspiring to commit murder, extortion and other activities in the last three decades and agreed to aid in investigations of the three crime families, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>Peter Caprio of Union, N.J., the 70-year-old leader of the Bruno family's so-called North Jersey crew, pleaded guilty in United States District Court here to a single count of conspiracy dating from the 1970's to last March. The plea by Mr. Caprio, who is nicknamed the Crum, follows an indictment in March charging him with the murders of two former associates in the Bruno family, William Gantz in 1975 and Joseph Sodano in 1996.</p>
        <p>''This seriously erodes the prominence of the Bruno crime family in New Jersey,'' Laura J. Kaplan, the assistant Unites States attorney who handled the case, said of Mr. Caprio's plea. ''This is the highest-ranking member of the Bruno crime family here in North Jersey.''</p>
        <p>In answer to questions relating to his plea today, prosecutors said Mr. Caprio also admitted participating with various people in other murders, as well as in loan sharking, gambling and extortion. In one case, Mr. Caprio admitted that he ordered a former Bruno family associate, Philip Casale, to kill Mr. Sodano.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kaplan said information from Mr. Casale had resulted in Mr. Caprio's indictment. She said that Mr. Casale was also cooperating with investigators and that he was awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy last fall. Mr. Casale and Mr. Caprio are both in Federal custody.</p>
        <p>Also significant, Ms. Kaplan said, is Mr. Caprio's agreement to cooperate in investigations of organized crime activities by families other than the Bruno mob. She said Mr. Caprio had already provided information regarding members of the Genovese and Gambino families, which are based in New York City but have operations in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Caprio's lawyer, Jean Barrett, declined to elaborate on the information provided by her client.</p>
        <p>''I don't know exactly what information he's going to provide to the government, but obviously there is an agreement on file in which he will cooperate,'' Ms. Barrett said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Caprio faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $250,000 fine, with sentencing set for Oct. 23.</p>
