        <p>Exelon, an electric utility company to be formed by the merger of Unicom and PECO Energy, has named Tierney Communications in Philadelphia, part of True North Communications, to handle its account, including television, print and out-of-home advertising; direct marketing; and public relations. Billings for a campaign to introduce the Exelon brand were estimated at $15 million.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a two-month review that had been narrowed to Tierney, which had handled the PECO account since 1986, and three agencies in Chicago: Leo Burnett USA, part of the B Com3  Group, which has handled the account of Commonwealth Edison, part of Unicom, since 1954; J. Walter Thompson, part of the WPP Group; and Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising.</p>
