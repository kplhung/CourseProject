        <p>Brendan Tracey had been looking forward to Chaminade High School's summer trip since he was 10 because that was when his older brother Craig went.</p>
        <p>This year, finally, Brendan got his chance. He was 16, a well-liked yearbook editor and volleyball player who had just finished his sophomore year. He left here last week with 17 classmates and 4 teachers for a three-week sightseeing tour of the West. On Saturday they were supposed to visit the Grand Canyon.</p>
        <p>They never made it. The students were less than an hour south of the canyon when one of the rental vans they were traveling in flipped over on an Arizona highway. Brendan, who officials said was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown from the van and killed, along with the van's driver, Brother Lawrence John Zarzycki, 38, a Chaminade mathematics teacher. Nine other passengers were injured.</p>
        <p>Today the students and teachers of Chaminade -- a selective, all-boys high school run by the Society of Marianists, a Roman Catholic order -- tried to make sense of the tragedy. The school's red and yellow flag, which flaps proudly after the victories of its champion track team, flew at half staff. Students on summer vacation called the high school on Long Island and logged on to its Web site for news. And the school's president, the Rev. James C. Williams, began preparing for funerals.</p>
        <p>''Brother Lawrence taught me when I was a student here,'' Father Williams said. ''He treated me like his son. And I taught Brendan during his freshman year, serving as his homeroom moderator and guidance counselor. As a father would mourn a son, this father -- I mourn the loss of a son.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety, Mark Hall, said that some of the students in the van, including Brendan, were not wearing seat belts. (Under Arizona law, only the people riding in the front of a van are required to wear them.) The driver, Brother Zarzycki, was wearing his when the van began to roll over.</p>
        <p>Father Williams said that he still lacked many details about the crash and that his first priority was caring for the injured and grieving students and their families. But he said that he planned to explore all aspects of the accident, including the seat belt issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall, of the safety department, said that investigators were exploring whether fatigue had played a role in the accident. He said that Brother Zarzycki had been driving for five hours when the Dodge van, which did not appear to have any mechanical problems, crashed about 11:45 a.m.</p>
        <p>The deaths of a well-liked student and a popular teacher shook up the Chaminade community. The school of 1,600 students is respected for both academics and athletics. Noted alumni include Brian Dennehy, the actor; Robert C. Wright, the president of NBC; and former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who recalled in his memoirs hitchhiking there each day from his home in Island Park.</p>
        <p>Brother Zarzycki was a son of the school. He was raised less than a mile away and attended Chaminade with two of his brothers. After graduating in 1980, he entered the Marianist order. He studied math at St. John's and Adelphi Universities, then took his vows and began teaching in 1984.</p>
        <p>Dan Aversano, a June graduate, took a typing class with Brother Zarzycki, whom he described as a generous man, and he recalled one particular favor the teacher had done a friend.</p>
        <p>''Senior year, students have to do these term papers,'' Dan said. ''They're very important. They have to be in on time, typed neatly. A friend of mine was working on his -- O.K., he sort of left it until the last minute -- when his computer busted. He came in early the day it was due, with the paper all written out, and found Brother Lawrence. Brother Lawrence let him inside the typing lab so he could get it done in time.''</p>
        <p>Colleagues remembered Brother Zarzycki's guitar playing, the music he chose for special occasions and, not least of all, the fact that he did the laundry for the other teachers who lived with him. In a statement, the school singled out this ''endless and thankless task that he handled with great personal devotion.''</p>
        <p>Brendan, who was raised in Garden City, the youngest of three sons, was remembered as an involved student. He played on Chaminade's volleyball team and was an editor of the yearbook. Father Williams said that he would have been chosen editor in chief as a senior.</p>
        <p>An altar boy at St. Joseph's Church in Garden City, he took communion every day at the school chapel. He volunteered with the service club, which had recently planted a meditation garden at the Queen of Peace Residence, a nursing home in Queens.</p>
        <p>Brendan and his classmates planted tiger lilies and baby's breath and poured a concrete path to make the garden accessible to people in wheelchairs. Sister Bernice Wall of the nursing home said residents wept when they heard the news of his death.</p>
        <p>Brendan's family asked for time to mourn in private today. In a statement, they listed the achievements of his short life and tried to distill his nature: ''Brendan was always the first one up in the morning for fishing trips with his grandpa on Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire, and the last one to leave the yearbook office at Chaminade in the evening.''</p>
