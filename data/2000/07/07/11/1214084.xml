        <p>Lance Armstrong today blew apart the Tour de France in its first day in the mountains, leaving his major rivals far behind and taking a huge step toward his second successive victory in the bicycle race.</p>
        <p>Clad in the yellow jersey of the leader, Armstrong said: ''It was a good day, a big day. The legs were good.''</p>
        <p>Indeed they were. The leader of the United States Postal Service team now is 4 minutes 14 seconds ahead of the rider in second place, Jan Ullrich, the German leader of Telekom, the winner of the 1997 Tour and the rival Armstrong seems to respect most.</p>
        <p>Such other contenders as Richard Virenque, Abraham Olano, Alex Zulle, Fernando Escartin, Laurent Jalabert, Bobby Julich and Marco Pantani are at least seven minutes behind.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is still in this race,'' Armstrong insisted to general disbelief. ''There's two weeks to go. They won't give up till Paris.'' That is where the Tour ends on July 23.</p>
        <p>The only feat the Texan did not quite pull off was victory in the 205-kilometer (127-mile) stage over three major and two minor climbs in the Pyrenees.</p>
        <p>Finishing first in nearly daylong heavy rain was Javier Otxoa, a Spaniard with Kelme, whose name is usually given as Ochoa except in the Tour's official rosters. Now in his fourth year as a professional, the 25-year-old rider scored his first victory by joining a small breakaway at Kilometer 50, building a big lead and holding a bit of it until the finish in fog and chilling cold atop the Hautacam mountain.</p>
        <p>The spent Otxoa wobbled home in 6:09:32, a speed of 33 kilometers an hour (20.5 miles an hour) for this 10th of 21 stages. Proceedings for the 162-man field began in Dax.</p>
        <p>''He deserved to win and I'm happy for him,'' Armstrong said. ''Probably 99 percent of the people here were Spaniards.'' Tens of thousands of spectators flooded the final road up despite the weather, which was not as ugly as forecast. The high winds and snow atop the climbs that had been predicted by the French Weather Service were nonexistent.</p>
        <p>The uglier the better, as far as Armstrong was concerned. He had been pleased on Sunday when he heard the forecast, noting that he rode well in bad weather -- at age 21 he won the world road race championship in 1993 in heavy rain in Oslo -- while cold and high winds would trouble the lighter Spanish climbers.</p>
        <p>Except for Otxoa, their main problem was Armstrong. Riding with determination and ease, Armstrong sped away from a clutch of Spaniards and other contenders to finish alone, 42 seconds behind in second place. Armstrong started the final 13.5-kilometer (8.4-mile) climb, on a gradient of nearly 8 percent, almost nine minutes behind the Spaniard.</p>
        <p>''Armstrong went like an airplane,'' Virenque, a member of the group Armstrong deserted, said in wonder.</p>
        <p>The new man in the yellow jersey, replacing Alberto Elli, an Italian with Telekom who is now 57th, had his own explanation.</p>
        <p>''I feel very strong,'' he said, a rare confession despite his impressive showing in the mountains of his final preparatory race last month. ''But this was a tactical race.''</p>
        <p>''The important part of the race began on the Aubisque,'' he said, two climbs from the end. Speaking of his team, he continued: ''We were maybe too aggressive in pulling at the start of the Aubisque.'' He had six of his eight teammates with him there but they faded one by one up the 16.5-kilometer (10.3-mile) climb on a 7.1 percent gradient.</p>
        <p>Halfway to the top, Armstrong was without support while Ullrich, Zulle and Pantani had at least one teammate to pace each of them.</p>
        <p>''My only choice was to wait,'' Armstrong said. Ahead, Virenque and Escartin were building a lead that surpassed two minutes. ''It was a little bit of a crisis for me -- two minutes was a lot to give.''</p>
        <p>Still two minutes behind, Armstrong stayed in his group until the Hautacam ascension 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) later. ''Everybody was waiting for an attack by Pantani, and sure enough, he did attack,'' Armstrong said, referring to the renowned climber.</p>
        <p>Armstrong followed him, then attacked. He looked back at Pantani, asking for a relay, saw that the Italian was spent and sped off. Soon he caught the Virenque group ahead, moved to its front and sped off alone again. Rising occasionally from his saddle to increase his leg thrust, Armstrong was uncatchable.</p>
        <p>Afterward, he tried to temper speculation that he would remain uncatchable all the way to Paris. ''There are still a lot of mountains,'' he said. ''There's still a lot that can happen.''</p>
        <p>He said much the same last year after he won the first mountain stage, leaving his foes demoralized, on his way to easy victory.</p>
