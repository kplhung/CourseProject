        <p>When President Clinton announced the Camp David summit meeting, he said he hoped that it would resolve the deepest matters dividing the Israelis and Palestinians, questions of ''beliefs, political identity, collective fate'' that raise dark fears and emotions. He also sounded a note of weary familiarity, saying that the issues were so well-known that the solutions should be within sight.</p>
        <p>As the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, begin their final peace talks with Mr. Clinton, they are expected to test how far apart they are on the future status of Jerusalem, the fate of more than three million Palestinian refugees and the borders of a Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>What is intertwined with these overarching issues is the question of how many Israeli settlers on the West Bank would remain in Israeli territory and how many would come under Palestinian rule and then, most likely, be resettled in Israel. The future of the Jordan Valley will also be on the table.</p>
        <p>International financial assistance is likely to be discussed, including an American component, to compensate refugees but also to help form a new Palestinian state. Separately, the Israelis are seeking an upgraded security relationship with the United States, though one that falls short of a mutual defense pact.</p>
        <p>The American team, led by Mr. Clinton, has not said whether it will work on all the issues at once or single out those where the most progress can be made. Nor has it signaled whether it will present precise American ideas -- known in negotiating parlance as ''bridging proposals'' -- for all the issues or just for some.</p>
        <p>Since the former Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and Mr. Arafat agreed in principle seven years ago on a peace settlement in which Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization recognized each other, these crucial issues have been kicked down the road for a final round of talks designed to formally end the more than five-decade conflict.</p>
        <p>The 1993 agreement, which was negotiated in Oslo and signed on the White House lawn, called for the two sides to make a final settlement by May 4, 1999.</p>
        <p>That deadline was extended last September -- in an agreement at Sharm el Sheik, Egypt -- to Sept. 13, 2000, the date Mr. Arafat has set for unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state if there is no final peace accord.</p>
        <p>Since Oslo, the Israelis have withdrawn from the Gaza Strip and about 40 percent of the West Bank. These moves were carried out after wrenching negotiations for interim accords, including one in 1998 at Wye, Md., where Mr. Clinton mediated between Mr. Arafat and the conservative Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
        <p>Now that the two sides have been called to the endgame on the hitherto too-tough-to-deal-with issues, the differences appear acute on every front. A senior American official said that in on-and-off talks over the last seven months, including back-channel negotiations in Stockholm, the two sides had ''demythologized'' the issues. But he said that gaps had been narrowed only in some areas. And that small progress, he said, was beginning to be eroded by bitterness in the last month.</p>
        <p>Jerusalem</p>
        <p>The question on which the least progress has been made, according to all participants in the negotiations, is Jerusalem. In Stockholm, there was a little bit of ''brainstorming'' on Jerusalem, but ''brainstorming is cheap,'' said an official familiar with the talks. A senior Israeli official said here last week that it was possible that agreement would be reached on several major points but that an agreement on Jerusalem was much more unlikely.</p>
        <p>The heart and soul of the Israeli position is still that Jerusalem is the undivided and eternal capital of Israel, the official said.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. Arafat said last month that he remained insistent that East Jerusalem become the capital of a Palestinian state. Those who disagreed, he scoffed, could ''go and drink from the Dead Sea.'' Mr. Arafat, his aides say, will not give up on Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials have suggested that Mr. Barak is considering granting increased autonomy to Palestinians in East Jerusalem -- specifically, more control of public services.</p>
        <p>A 1995 document by Yossi Beilin, now Israeli justice minister, and Abu Mazen, secretary of the Palestine Liberation Organization, had compromises on a range of issues, but, showing how tough the issue is, not on whose capital the city would be.</p>
        <p>Published versions of the document, known as the Beilin-Mazen agreement, outline compromises on all the major issues in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and components of it are being revived as the talks open. One version of the document says the boundaries of greater Jerusalem would be expanded to encompass Palestinian districts, including the towns of Abu Dis, Al Ayzariyan and Salwan. The Palestinian Authority would create a capital in these new districts and call it Al Quds and not Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>For the estimated 200,000 Arabs who live in Jerusalem, a municipal council would be formed to manage local affairs under the supervision of the Israeli council that is now responsible for the whole city. And the Palestinian flag would be flown from the Islamic holy sites.</p>
        <p>In essence, because the plan does not recognize Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem, it has been dismissed by Arab diplomats as the ''Jewish solution.'' It seemed impossible, they said, that Mr. Arafat would be able to live with what would amount to only linguistic niceties, such as Palestinian ''autonomy'' in East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Administration officials, as well as Israelis and Palestinians, have said that if the Camp David sessions get as far as tackling Jerusalem, the compromises necessary on both sides will be so substantial that the talks could break down at that point. In the days before the meeting, there have been increasing suggestions that the White House might have to settle for an agreement that would leave decisions on Jerusalem for another day.</p>
        <p>But some officials have said that in an overall package there could be the possibility of both sides moving to fall-back positions on Jerusalem in return for a final agreement that ended all claims by either side.</p>
        <p>Territory</p>
        <p>On the question of territory -- how much and where the Israelis will give up land on the West Bank -- there appears to have been some behind-the-scenes movement. Indeed, both Israelis and Palestinians say this has been where there has been the most progress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat and his aides have repeatedly declared that Israel must withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza to the borders that existed before the 1967 war, in accordance with the United Nations Resolution 242. Part of Mr. Arafat's insistence is based on what he calls the precedent laid down by Israel in its peace deals with Egypt in 1979, when 100 percent of Sinai was yielded, and in Jordan in 1994, when Israel exchanged some land with Jordan to compensate for land taken by Israel decades before along their joint border.</p>
        <p>But in private, the Palestinian leader has acknowledged to American officials that large Israeli settlements on the West Bank are certain to be annexed by Israel in a final deal. In return for such a concession, Mr. Arafat contends that Israel must ''swap'' some Israeli land to be included in the new Palestinian state. Mr. Barak's advisers are reported to be divided on this issue.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials said that Mr. Barak opposes swapping land because it would encroach on the notion of Israeli sovereignty.</p>
        <p>So far, the Israelis have not been precise on the amount of territory they are prepared to give up on the West Bank. The Israeli press has reported that between 90 and 92 percent would be ceded -- much more than the 60 or 75 percent that had been generally thought. The Barak government has not officially acknowledged that it is considering these higher figures, though.</p>
        <p>A senior Israeli official said that land with about 70 percent of the 175,000 settlers would be annexed to Israel. The future of the remaining settlers -- those in outlying areas or scattered settlements -- would have to be negotiated.</p>
        <p>These settlers, according to preliminary discussions, would have a choice of taking Palestinian citizenship -- a highly unlikely choice -- or of being moved back to Israel. The Israelis are insisting on no ''arbitrary'' dismantling of settlements.</p>
        <p>Refugees</p>
        <p>In many respects, the negotiators believe that the future of more than three million Palestinian refugees, most of whom either left Israel after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war or are their descendants, may be the easiest problem to solve. About a million are in camps run by international agencies in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
        <p>The mantra of the Palestinian Authority has been that these refugees must have the right to return to Israel and that Israel must accept responsibility for the fact they fled or were expelled. Israel says it refuses to accept responsibility and will not acknowledge the right of return but will show ''empathy'' for the refugees, said a special adviser to Mr. Barak, Yossi Alpher.</p>
        <p>The Barak government is prepared, Mr. Alpher says, as a ''humanitarian gesture,'' to allow some family reunification.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials faced with budgetary and space limitations on how many refugees they want to take  into their new state could be willing to go along with a concept that grants the right of return in principle but stops short of actually carrying it out, officials said.</p>
        <p>About 2.7 million Palestinians live on the West Bank and Gaza, and United Nations officials estimate the Palestinian Authority would accept the return of up to 500,000 refugees phased over a number of years.</p>
        <p>A sizable international aid package spread over 20 years has been suggested for compensating the refugees and the governments that have been hosts to them. Japan, the European Union and the United States would be the major contributors.</p>
        <p>Other Issues</p>
        <p>On the future of the Jordan Valley, the Israelis officially assert that the area will remain Israel's security border but that the security presence may be phased out over a period of time. While the eventual loss of the Jordan Valley is not popular in Israel, it is not nearly as sensitive an issue as Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Barak, particularly in his precarious political situation, the size of the American aid package and the upgrading of the security relationship are of utmost importance. Part of his ability to sell a peace deal in general elections would depend on how much he was able to bring home from Washington in terms of new weaponry and radar capable of detecting missiles.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Arafat is expecting financial aid from the United States, as well as Japan and the European Union. Mr. Arafat's chief economic adviser, Mohammed Rachid, said the Palestinians would ask the Americans for $40 billion, much of it for refugee assistance.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 14, 2000, Friday  A chart on Tuesday listing issues to be discussed in the Middle East peace talks at Camp David referred incorrectly to Resolution 242 of the United Nations Security Council, which was approved after the Middle East war of 1967. It calls for the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces ''from territories occupied in the recent conflict''; it is the Palestinians who associate that language with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>
