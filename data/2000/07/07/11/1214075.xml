        <p>The father told his 8-year-old son to put down the aluminum bat and use a wooden one. The son resisted. The father repeated why the son would benefit from using a wooden bat. The son frowned, he cried, he refused to give up the aluminum bat. But the boy finally acquiesced because he would not have been allowed to play otherwise.</p>
        <p>The father also told his son, who was a natural right-handed batter, that he needed to bat left-handed for five years without interruption. Again, the son was upset. Calmly yet sternly, the father explained why it was important to be a switch-hitter. Tears gathering in his eyes, the boy moved to the other batter's box and stayed there until he was 13.</p>
        <p>These scenes happened in Rio Piedras, P.R., and Jorge Posada Sr. proudly told these stories Sunday about his son -- the catcher for the Yankees, who will participate in the All-Star Game on Tuesday night. The father arrived here today from Puerto Rico and admitted that when the American League opposes the National League at Turner Field, he will still see images of the skinny boy who did not initially understand his strict baseball lessons.</p>
        <p>''I always used to tell him to remember what we were doing and to remember that it was for the future,'' Posada Sr. said. ''Now I ask him, 'Do you remember?' ''</p>
        <p>The Yankee catcher remembers. Merely mentioning his father's name caused the 28-year-old to grin and then caused his eyes to moisten. He remembers not being able to use an aluminum bat, but he is appreciative now since he never had to adjust to wood. He remembers feeling feeble as a left-handed hitter, but he now realizes how marketable a solid switch-hitting catcher is in the major leagues.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him,'' Posada said. ''I was a project of his.''</p>
        <p>While Posada sat behind a table in a hotel ballroom with the other A.L. All-Stars today, he was so awestruck that he wondered if any of the reporters would interview him. Posada lamented that he would not be able to talk to Cal Ripken Jr., one of several premier players who will miss the game because of injuries, and reminisced about watching All-Star Games when he was 13.</p>
        <p>As giddy as Posada was, he obviously belongs on this team after batting .309 with 14 homers and 41 runs batted in and flourishing in his first year as the full-time starter.</p>
        <p>Toronto's David Wells, who will start for the A.L. while Roger Clemens -- who was traded to the Yankees for him -- is home, called Posada ''one of the finest catchers in the game.'' Milwaukee's Bob Wickman, a former Yankee, said Posada ''has everything you want in a catcher,'' and credited him with being the first person to implore him to throw his sinker to left-handed hitters.</p>
        <p>''When you come from where he did last year, where everyone was asking the question 'What's wrong with Jorge?' it's special,'' said Joe Torre, the A.L. manager, who selected Posada as a reserve behind Ivan Rodriguez, who was chosen in the fans' balloting. ''To see him on the All-Star team is great.''</p>
        <p>Posada told Derek Jeter before the season that one of his personal goals was to make the All-Star team. He told his father that, too, and it made Jorge Sr. happy. When Posada was asked how he is similar to his father, he responded: ''Workaholics. I watched him work three jobs when I was a kid, so I had to be the same way.''</p>
        <p>Jorge Posada Sr. is a driven, competitive man, traits that he passed on to a son who he felt should have been the starting catcher with the Yankees by 1996, not the pseudo-starter in 1998. As a 27-year-old, Posada Sr. defected from Cuba in 1968 by stowing away on a tobacco ship with a bottle of water, a credit card and his prayers.</p>
        <p>When the ship reached Greece, Posada Sr. slipped off before the cargo was unloaded and hiked into the woods. He did not emerge until his clothes had dried a day later. Eventually, Posada Sr. went to New York, to Spain and then to meet his parents in Puerto Rico four months after he had first hid on the ship.</p>
        <p>''In Cuba, I lived with Fidel Castro for eight years,'' Posada said. ''It's crazy, you know? I was surprised I could ever get away.''</p>
        <p>When Jorge Jr. was born in 1971, Jorge Sr. told his wife, Tamara, that his son would play baseball and cycle competitively, the only two sports the father considered important. Posada Sr. played baseball for 10 years in Cuba and won eight straight cycling championships there. At 60, he still plays in a softball league and cycles 25 miles every Sunday.</p>
        <p>The father was so serious about his training regime for Jorge Jr. that he interrupted basketball games to pull Jorge off the court. Jorge dabbled in basketball, volleyball and track in high school, but his father viewed these sports as a waste of time.</p>
        <p>''My friends told me I was crazy,'' Posada Sr. said. ''They couldn't believe I wouldn't let him play basketball. I just told them to watch where he goes. I was lucky. Some kids wouldn't have listened.''</p>
        <p>Posada remembers being 7 years old when his father gave him a gallon of paint on a Saturday morning and told him to paint a wall. It was not that the wall needed painting as much as it was about developing a work ethic at such a young age.</p>
        <p>''He wanted me to succeed,'' Posada said. ''He wanted me to bat left-handed, he wouldn't let me pick up an aluminum bat. He wanted me to get on my bike and go play baseball. That was it.''</p>
        <p>Little Jorge begged his father for an aluminum bat. The bats always felt lighter and stronger, the balls always sailed farther and the contact with the ball even sounded cooler. Ping. Posada Sr. kept telling his son that he should use a wooden bat for the next 10 years if he wanted to play in the majors.</p>
        <p>Sometimes those inspiring words meant nothing. When Posada was 11 years old, his switch-hitting experiment stagnated and he struck out in 21 straight at-bats. But Jorge Sr. would not let his son return to hitting right-handed, reminding him that these struggles would help him. On the 22nd at-bat, Posada Jr. lined a homer. He was thrilled and waved to his father, who was coaching the opposing team, as he rounded third base, saying: ''Father, do you love me now? Look at that.''</p>
        <p>Posada Sr. was scouting for the Atlanta Braves when Jorge was a shortstop for Calhoun Community College in Alabama, but they refused his recommendation to consider his son as a catcher. The Yankees liked Posada's athleticism, figured he could catch and drafted him in the 24th round in 1990. But Posada spent six full years in the minors, often making his father wonder if he would have been better off with another organization.</p>
        <p>''I think Jorge should have been in the majors in 1996,'' Posada Sr. said. ''He made the All-Star team in Triple A in '95 and '96 and he never got to stay in the major leagues. But now he's there, he's happy and he's on a team with a great tradition.''</p>
        <p>The father rarely travels to New York to watch the son because he hates the traffic and because he wants his son to rest, not play tour guide for him. The father usually watches the Yankees on television, but he needed to see the All-Star Game in person and needed to see the continued improvement of his son, his project.</p>
        <p>''I wanted him to think about what we were doing and remember it,'' Posada said. He paused and then said, ''He remembered everything.''</p>
