        <p>For the second year, a gun buyback program in Brooklyn will seek to take hundreds of guns off the streets, the police commissioner and the Brooklyn district attorney announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Last year's effort yielded 659 weapons over four weeks, and Charles J. Hynes, the district attorney, said he hoped even more would be turned in this year.</p>
        <p>After years of falling homicide rates, the number of slayings in Brooklyn jumped about 27 percent in the first half of last year as compared with the same period in 1998,  the district attorney's office said. Although the rise in homicides leveled off to about 12 percent by the end of the year, the increase prompted Mr. Hynes to appoint a task force to study the problem. Gun buyback programs were among the issues the task force discussed.</p>
        <p>This year, homicides in Brooklyn are down, to 126 so far from 145 during the first half of last year, Mr. Hynes's office said. But guns were used in a higher percentage of the deaths that did occur. This year guns were used to commit 90, or about 71 percent, of all Brooklyn homicides, up from 64 percent during the first half of last year.</p>
        <p>Under the new program, residents can place their guns in paper bags wrapped with string or tape, turn them in at any police precinct office, and receive a voucher for $100, which can be redeemed at the district attorney's office. As part of the deal, no one turning in a gun will be arrested for possession of a weapon.</p>
        <p>Only 10 guns have been turned in since the program, which is being financed with drug forfeiture money allotted to Mr. Hynes's office, started at the beginning of the month, said Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for Mr. Hynes. Posters and pamphlets will  advertise the effort in English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Polish and  Creole. The program continues until August.</p>
        <p>Experts disagree about the effectiveness of gun buyback programs. Some say they can reduce crime rates in the short term, while others suggest that gun owners could use the opportunity to pawn off a shoddy weapon and purchase a new one.</p>
        <p>Even supporters of the Brooklyn program voiced some concerns.</p>
        <p>Some people might be intimidated by having to walk into a precinct station house, said Andrew Karmen,  a sociology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a member of the Brooklyn task force. ''To walk into a precinct, I think, is a chilling aspect of the program,'' he said. Instead, he suggested that police set up drop-off points in more discreet locations, such as street corners and school grounds.</p>
        <p>Lawrence Sherman, the president of the International Society of Criminology and University of Pennsylvania professor, was less optimistic about the effort. ''I think they're wasting their money,'' said Dr. Sherman, an author of a recent study for the Justice Department that listed gun buyback programs under ''what doesn't work.'' He added that those who took advantage of the program could use the $100 to buy a more powerful gun on the black market.</p>
