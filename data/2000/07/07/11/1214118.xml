        <p>The state attorney general's office released statistics today showing that the number of inmates who are eligible for parole and still awaiting hearings is approaching 3,000, far higher than the number that the New Jersey Parole Board, which has been sued by inmates, has acknowledged.</p>

        <p>The state attorney general's office released statistics today showing that the number of inmates who are eligible for parole and still awaiting hearings is approaching 3,000, far higher than the number that the New Jersey Parole Board, which has been sued by inmates, has acknowledged.</p>
        <p>The parole board's chairman, Andrew B. Consovoy, had insisted for months that they were eliminating a backlog that was much worse a year ago. A report that the board submitted to the attorney general's office in May listed a total of 303 inmates who were ''past-eligible'' and awaiting hearings.</p>
        <p>But the attorney general's office, which is defending the lawsuit, said today that the backlog had reached 2,815, including 2,201 inmates who had not been granted hearings, 469 who had had hearings but were still awaiting a decision, and 145 who had been ruled eligible for parole but were awaiting release.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the attorney general, Roger Shatzkin, said that two deputy attorneys general had worked with parole officials to account for all past-eligible inmates, including those omitted from the reports the board submits regularly to other state agencies. Those numbers are not made public by the board, which reports only to the governor.</p>
        <p>The class-action complaint, filed on May 1 in Federal District Court in Camden, claimed that hundreds of inmates were left in prison without the hearings required by state law. But the plaintiffs' attorneys did not know the size of the backlog.</p>
        <p>Philip Steven Fuoco, the Haddonfield, N.J., lawyer who filed the suit, said today that ''we should be outraged, especially given what the parole board was telling everyone, including the Legislature, about the numbers.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fuoco said that lawyers for the state had notified him of the accounting on Friday, before releasing the information to reporters, and that they were acting ''in good faith'' to settle the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Consovoy, who is on medical leave, could not be reached for comment after the new numbers were released late today, and calls to the parole board office were not answered.</p>
        <p>The board chairman is under investigation for his role in the release of several inmates, according to people who have been contacted by state investigators. He left on medical leave a short time after a June 13 meeting with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's chief of staff, Michael Torpey.</p>
        <p>The governor said at the time that she wanted explanations of the backlog and of allegations that Mr. Consovoy had given favorable treatment to several inmates, including one identified as an organized crime figure.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman was at a meeting of the National Governors' Association today, and her press secretary, Jayne O'Connor, who was traveling with her, could not be reached.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, before the inmates' suit was filed, criminal defense lawyers publicly pressed Mr. Consovoy on the situation.</p>
        <p>Barry Albin, the president of the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey, when told today of the accounting by the attorney general's office, said: ''If that's true, then the parole board has given everyone a snow job. Consovoy had told me it was down to a couple hundred.''</p>
        <p>The board's executive director, Robert Egles, said in an interview in May that board members were working furiously on their regular caseload, about 1,500 new cases a month, and holding hearings for those who had passed their eligibility dates.</p>
        <p>''The problems that existed are so far into the process of being resolved that I don't know what this is all about,'' he said at that time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Egles also said that many of the inmates whose cases were back-logged had already reached their eligibility dates in county jails before being sent to the state prisons. In the accounting released today, 633 of the 2,815 past-eligible cases were in that category. The total inmate population is about 30,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fuoco, the lawyer for the inmates' suit, said that ''not only are there 2,800 past due, but every day more become eligible.'' He added, ''We need to set up an enforcement mechanism to make sure this doesn't happen again.''</p>
