        <p>Mets catcher Mike Piazza was resting at home yesterday, two days after being beaned by the Yankees' Roger Clemens, and the Mets' spokesman, Jay Horwitz, said Piazza had no immediate plans for a magnetic resonance imaging test.</p>
        <p>Piazza suffered a concussion -- the third or fourth of his career, he guessed -- and he will miss tonight's All-Star Game in Atlanta, for which he was the National League's top vote-getter.</p>
        <p>The Mets were still perturbed yesterday about the incident.</p>
        <p>''I think Mike is ticked off at Roger,'' Al Leiter, the Mets' pitcher, said yesterday at the All-Star Game festivities in Atlanta. ''I think Mike should be. I think it's more of a Piazza-Clemens issue then it is a team-to-team issue. What happens if Roger is pitching in Houston next year? Is the whole team still mad at him?''</p>
        <p>Maybe. Both General Manager Steve Phillips and Manager Bobby Valentine used a common expletive to characterize Clemens's behavior, and Piazza said that he had no respect for Clemens. Leiter, who was originally scheduled to travel on the Yankees' charter plane to Atlanta, was told by the Mets to make other arrangements.</p>
        <p>While Leiter was uncertain if Clemens was trying to hit Piazza in such a delicate position, he admitted that it looked terrible and said: ''You're talking about a guy's livelihood, his life. Forget his job. You hit him in the face and you could kill him with a 94-mile-per-hour heater.''</p>
        <p>Joe Torre said that he feels ''very bad'' about the incident and sorry that ''an exciting series turned ugly.'' Torre added that he understands why Piazza and Valentine are upset because he was hit in the head as a player, too.</p>
        <p>''You don't want to be given any reason, whether it's legitimate or not,'' Torre said. ''You're caught up in the emotion.''</p>
        <p>Several Mets were disappointed that Clemens did not leave the mound to check on Piazza. He stood a few feet in front of the mound with his hands on his knees and a stoic look on his face.</p>
        <p>''I would have walked up to him and said, 'Hey, man, is he all right? Is he O.K.?,'' Leiter said. ''As awkward as it might have been, the gesture would have gone a long way.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Mets made one roster move yesterday, promoting the veteran left-hander RICH RODRIGUEZ from Class AAA Norfolk, as they promised him when he accepted the minor league assignment on June 28. The right-hander ERIC CAMMACK was sent back to Norfolk.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez, who signed a two-year, $1.5 million contract in January, had a 7.67 earned run average for the Mets and was pitching almost exclusively in blowouts. Though Rodriguez had given the Mets little reason to use him, BOBBY VALENTINE said Rodriguez may have performed better had he pitched in more critical spots.</p>
        <p>''After so many years, that adrenaline flow needs to be there to have that real competitive edge,'' Valentine said over the weekend.</p>
        <p>In five games for Norfolk, Rodriguez pitched nine innings, allowing two runs on four hits and a walk.</p>
