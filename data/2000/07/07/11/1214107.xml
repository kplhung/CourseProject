        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton continued her focus on economic issues today as she called for a new formula to calculate the amount of money New York receives from the federal government for Medicaid expenditures. Her formula, she said, could cut residents' taxes by an average of $400 a year.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, who made the recommendations in a speech to about 100 people at an American Legion hall in this Albany suburb, said that the current formula reimbursed New York at the lowest rate of federal subsidy for Medicaid.

        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton continued her focus on economic issues today as she called for a new formula to calculate the amount of money New York receives from the federal government for Medicaid expenditures. Her formula, she said, could cut residents' taxes by an average of $400 a year.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, who made the recommendations in a speech to about 100 people at an American Legion hall in this Albany suburb, said that the current formula reimbursed New York at the lowest rate of federal subsidy for Medicaid. Since New York's counties share the cost of Medicaid with the state, the change she proposes would provide the state with about $3 billion a year, she said.</p>
        <p>Her proposal is similar to recommendations made by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the man she hopes to succeed. The difference, Mrs. Clinton said, is that an expected increase in the federal budget surplus would make her plan more palatable politically, with the increased subsidy coming from those funds.</p>
        <p>''Now, because of the surplus, we can present this choice,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''And I think we have a better chance than we've ever had to create a coalition that would enable us to pass this.''</p>
        <p>The proposal came at the end of a five-day campaign tour that has taken Mrs. Clinton to a dozen communities from western New York to the Albany area. As she has done frequently during the tour, Mrs. Clinton told the audience that her most pressing priority, if she is elected senator, will be to work to stimulate the economy of upstate New York.</p>
        <p>The plan being pushed by Mrs. Clinton would use a formula that largely takes into account the percentage of the population classified as living in poverty. Under the current system, Medicaid reimbursement is determined by the state's per capita income.</p>
        <p>The current method, Mrs. Clinton said, means that the federal government covers about 50 percent of New York's Medicaid expenses, while other states receive more than 60 percent.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said that her proposal was likely to be viewed skeptically by Republicans in Congress. ''Obviously I'm in an election, so people on the other side of the aisle will probably come out against it within 10 or 15 minutes, if not sooner, because they don't want me to present an idea that sounds like a good idea,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''But I think it could provide a way out of the dilemma we've been in,'' she added. ''We couldn't have presented it too much earlier because we didn't have the projected surpluses that would have provided the funding for it.''</p>
        <p>In addressing other economic issues, Mrs. Clinton again discussed her interest in bringing better airline service and lower fares, as well as lower utility rates, to upstate cities. She has also talked often about promoting tourism in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>While she has offered few specifics on many of the items in her plan, she has nonetheless made economic issues the centerpiece of this campaign trip. At every stop, her staff has distributed brochures with the headline, ''Hillary's Upstate Economic Agenda.''</p>
