        <p>You've heard it by now a million times: drink at least eight glasses of water a day. And, to be sure, water, as a beverage, has become much more popular in recent years. Nearly everywhere you go, you're likely to see someone carrying a water bottle. Even many backpacks and some belt pouches are now equipped with holders for water bottles.</p>
        <p>And maybe you are among the smart ones who know the value of being well hydrated, especially, but not only, in warm weather and when physically active.</p>
        <p>But at the same time, concerns about water safety have skyrocketed. Sales of bottled water, which may or may not be safer than tap water, are soaring. So are sales of home water treatment systems, from inexpensive carafes and faucet attachments that filter water through activated carbon to much more costly countertop and under-the-sink units permanently connected to the sink's water supply.</p>
        <p>Why Drink Water?</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, if you are an avid water drinker, you are in the minority. The average American consumes a bit more than half the recommended amount of water each day and an equal amount of dehydrating beverages, which include any drink with caffeine or alcohol. In effect, these cancel each other out because for every dehydrating drink consumed, an additional glass of water should be drunk.</p>
        <p>Every system in your body, from brain to bowel, depends on water. As IDEA, an international health and fitness organization, has pointed out, ''Water regulates body temperature, transports nutrients and oxygen, carries away waste, helps detoxify the kidneys and liver, dissolves vitamins and minerals and cushions the body from injury. Every day you lose on average 10 to 12 cups of water that needs to be replaced to maintain your body's important fluid balance.''</p>
        <p>The average adult body contains 40 to 50 quarts of water. Your blood is 83 percent water; muscles are 75 percent water; the brain is 74 percent water and even bone is 22 percent water.</p>
        <p>Water lubricates every joint in your body and keeps tissue from sticking together. With dehydration, your body and brain become sluggish, your blood thickens and your heart is forced to work overly hard. Water is essential to the digestive tract, from the digestion and absorption of food and nutrients to the elimination of wastes. Fiber alone is not enough to aid normal bowel function. Without adequate water, fiber, which increases the water-holding capacity of the stool, can be constipating.</p>
        <p>Water is also the body's air-conditioning system. When you become too warm, the loss of water through the pores of the skin, sweat glands and lungs prevents the body from building up too much internal heat. Athletes who fail to drink enough during a prolonged, grueling activity can reach potentially lethal body temperatures, which is what happened to Alberto Salazar upon winning the Boston Marathon in 1982.</p>
        <p>He required emergency administration of six liters of intravenous fluids to replenish his loss of water and salts. Three years earlier after a particularly challenging race, his body temperature had soared to 107 degrees and he was administered last rites. The loss of just 15 percent to 20 percent of the body's water is fatal.</p>
        <p>You don't have to be aware of perspiration to be losing a great deal of water. And even if you are completely inactive, your body produces heat through metabolic processes that it may have to dissipate through ''insensible'' perspiration.</p>
        <p>Skin cells, too, need water to look healthy. Yet millions of appearance-conscious American women walk around like dried prunes, afraid to drink water lest they become bloated or have to use the bathroom. However, it is not water that is bloating but rather the excess salts and carbohydrates consumed that hold water in the body.</p>
        <p>As for bathrooms, I've learned not to be shy and have yet to be denied the use of someone's or someplace's bathroom. At public events when the line for the ladies' room has become unconscionably long, I've been among women who've commandeered the men's room.</p>
        <p>What and When to Drink</p>
        <p>Don't rely on thirst to tell you when to drink. By the time thirst hits, you're already mildly dehydrated. Even mild dehydration can impair physical and mental performance. Know the symptoms of dehydration: headache, lethargy, dizziness, mental fuzziness and loss of appetite. A tennis partner who perspires heavily when he plays suffers a daylong headache if he fails to drink enough. He now drinks 16 ounces of water before playing, another 16 while playing and 16 more afterward.</p>
        <p>There is no set amount of hydrating drinks a person should consume. Eight eight-ounce glasses should be the minimum for the average person. IDEA suggests calculating basic fluid needs by dividing your weight in half to get the number of ounces to consume each day. But if you are active, if the weather is hot and humid, if you're at a high altitude or if you have a cold or fever, you're likely to need considerably more fluid than the minimum.</p>
        <p>The American Dietetic Association recommends consuming at least two cups of fluids two hours before physical exertion, followed by another two cups of water about 15 to 20 minutes before your activity and further drinks every 15 to 20 minutes during the activity.</p>
        <p>As for the need for sports drinks that contain electrolytes (sodium and other minerals that are lost through sweat), that depends on the duration of your activity and how heavily you perspire.</p>
        <p>A heavy workout lasting more than an hour, or exercise done in extreme environmental conditions (like high-altitude hiking or singles tennis at 90 degrees) may warrant a sports drink to replace lost electrolytes as well as water. But because many of these drinks are overly sweetened, which would delay water absorption, they are best ''chased'' with an equal amount of water.</p>
        <p>Water -- plain, flavored, even lightly carbonated -- is the best replacement fluid under most circumstances. Decaffeinated coffee, tea or sugar-free soft drinks and diluted fruit juice will also work. But any beverage that contains a fair amount of sugar or salt, or any caffeine or alcohol-containing drink, is likely to increase, not satisfy, your water need.</p>
        <p>Foods that are mostly water, like watermelon, which is 98 percent water, can also be a help as long as they are not too rich in carbohydrates or salt.</p>
        <p>How can you get in all the water you need? By having keeping water handy. I'm a big fan of insulated, handled, quart-sized cups, which I keep at my desk, in my car and wherever I sit to read.</p>
        <p>I also pack a water bottle in my briefcase and carry one on my belt pouch. On airplanes, where the atmosphere is as dry as the Sahara, I book an aisle seat and drink eight ounces of water for every hour in the air. The extra water helps to reduce jet lag and travel fatigue.</p>
        <p>This is the first of two columns on the body's need for water. Next week: safety standards for the water supply.</p>
