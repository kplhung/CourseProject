        <p>There was a time when the idea of reggae music pulsing through the hallowed concert halls of Lincoln Center might have seemed like sacrilege.

        <p>No longer is it surprising to see something like ''Pour Antigone,'' a dance theater piece by the French choreographer Mathilde Monnier that explores the dynamics between Greek tragedy and modern Africa and opens on July 26, alongside the established Bolshoi Ballet, which starts performances next Tuesday. Or Lev Dodin's adaptation of Fyodor Abramov's novel ''Brothers and Sisters'' staged by the Maly Drama Theater of St. Petersburg, a six-hour epic in Russian with English supertitles and a cast of 40, juxtaposed with ''Spinning Into Butter,'' a new play about racism and political correctness by Rebecca Gilman with a cast of 7.</p>

        <p>There was a time when the idea of reggae music pulsing through the hallowed concert halls of Lincoln Center might have seemed like sacrilege. But as the Lincoln Center Festival prepares to open its fifth season tonight, such fare is now almost taken for granted on Manhattan's main cultural campus.</p>
        <p>No longer is it surprising to see something like ''Pour Antigone,'' a dance theater piece by the French choreographer Mathilde Monnier that explores the dynamics between Greek tragedy and modern Africa and opens on July 26, alongside the established Bolshoi Ballet, which starts performances next Tuesday. Or Lev Dodin's adaptation of Fyodor Abramov's novel ''Brothers and Sisters'' staged by the Maly Drama Theater of St. Petersburg, a six-hour epic in Russian with English supertitles and a cast of 40, juxtaposed with ''Spinning Into Butter,'' a new play about racism and political correctness by Rebecca Gilman with a cast of 7.</p>
        <p>The summer festival is part of a broader effort by Lincoln Center over the last few years to expand its purview beyond the classics and to reach out to new audiences year round. In addition to the festival, Lincoln Center's newer offerings include Jazz at Lincoln Center, which started as a program called classical jazz and grew into a full-fledged constituent; New Visions, which commissions productions as part of the Great Performers series; and Midsummer Night Swing, dancing to live bands on the Lincoln Center plaza.</p>
        <p>''It really was the opportunity to do two things: present art forms that have not been represented and bring in new audiences, more diverse, less affluent,'' said Nathan Leventhal, president of Lincoln Center, who will step down in December after nearly 17 years.</p>
        <p>Presenting the kind of unconventional programs that might more typically be found at the Brooklyn Academy of Music requires a delicate balancing act for Lincoln Center. Loyal audiences and longtime contributors need to be assured that the institution is not abandoning its base. And programming executives must contend with Lincoln Center's 12 constituents, some of whom, like the Metropolitan Opera and the Philharmonic, have complained in the past that some events in the summer festival, which is produced by Lincoln Center itself, encroached on their turf.</p>
        <p>''The constituents have primacy,'' said Beverly Sills, chairwoman of Lincoln Center. ''We cannot step on their toes, nor do we want to.''</p>
        <p>The festival, which does not release any figures on earnings or attendance, must also be careful to balance riskier presentations with more mainstream events, like the Bolshoi and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, that can be counted on to sell out or come close.</p>
        <p>Nigel Redden, the director of the festival, said he was careful to try to push the boundaries without going overboard. ''There are some things I wouldn't put in the State Theater,'' he said. ''I make some attempt to match the spaces with what I believe the audience potential will be.''</p>
        <p>Last year the festival exceeded box office projections for the first time, in large part because of the publicity generated by ''The Peony Pavilion,'' the Chinese opera that came to the festival after being scheduled and then canceled by the Chinese authorities a year before. Box office receipts account for a little more than a third of the festival's $9 million budget, with the bulk of the rest coming from donations.</p>
        <p>Despite the risks and growing pains attached to programming like the festival, Ms. Sills said Lincoln Center had no choice but to forge ahead. ''The last decade showed us there was a whole new world coming in, and we have to be a part of that,'' she said. ''Lincoln Center cannot turn into 12 museums.''</p>
        <p>Some constituents pride themselves on presenting the classics, while others seek out adventurous programs. The median age of Lincoln Center's audiences is 50 for song recitals and 55 for other programs, while the median age at the Brooklyn Academy is 42 for its Next Wave Festival and 46 for other events.</p>
        <p>So far Lincoln Center's new programming terrain seems to be bearing fruit. Surveys last summer showed that nearly 20 percent of the festival audience, almost one-third of whom were under 35, had never been to Lincoln Center before, and that an additional 25 percent had never been to the festival.</p>
        <p>And the institution has changed in the eyes of its peers. ''They have made courageous artistic choices,'' said Joseph V. Melillo, the executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy.</p>
        <p>Encouraging this new thinking has in part been the work of Jane Moss, the vice president for programming since 1992. ''I had no interest in coming in and preserving the status quo,'' Ms. Moss said.</p>
        <p>In particular she has tackled the area of classical music, trying to broaden the scope of what Lincoln Center includes and to make the presentations more accessible, using video, for example. A series on Sibelius included a documentary film. And Lincoln Center recently presented a series featuring archival film of great pianists from the 20th century.</p>
        <p>''The classical music event itself is somewhat anachronistic in this day and age,'' Ms. Moss said. ''In a world that is increasingly visual, it is a nonvisual activity.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Moss said she had also devoted considerable energy to building up Lincoln Center's educational programs, like pre-concert lectures and post-performance discussions, working to generate publicity around events to get the word out to nontraditional audiences and commissioning new work to attract artists who have not been staples of Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>Through the New Visions series, which started in 1998, the stage director Peter Sellars created theatrical versions of Bach cantatas performed by the mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment from London. The choreographer Bill T. Jones, in collaboration with the soprano Jessye Norman, offered an original work, ''How! Do! We! Do!''</p>
        <p>''It's not about replacing, but about adding and expanding,'' Ms. Moss said. ''It's exciting to see people discovering this music for the first time.''</p>
        <p>Planning the festival, which runs through July 30, is the job of Mr. Redden, who has been its director since 1998. ''I wanted the festival to be an ambitious event that would stretch the limits,'' said Mr. Redden, who also directs the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C.</p>
        <p>A man who relishes the details, Mr. Redden was excited about the 7,000 gallons of water that will flood the stage of the New York State Theater when the United States premiere of the Netherlands Opera's ''Writing to Vermeer'' opens the festival tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>In addition to bringing work of an international scope to New York, Mr. Redden said he was trying to feature culture that was already in the city but on a bigger platform; thus this season's series on Caribbean music, including reggae, voodoo, calypso and Creole.</p>
        <p>''This is where Lincoln Center has put itself most on the line,'' he said. ''It's not high-comfort programming all of the time.''</p>
