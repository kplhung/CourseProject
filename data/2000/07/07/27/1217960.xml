        <p>LIKE many people, Tim Keck, the publisher of two weekly newspapers in the Pacific Northwest, has come to depend on his cell phone.</p>
        <p>And like many other cell phone users, Mr. Keck has begun to worry about possible health risks connected with its use.</p>
        <p>''I'm sometimes scared my brain is getting boiled,'' said Mr. Keck, whose newspaper in Seattle, The Stranger, is known for its jaded humor.</p>
        <p>''But it's so convenient that I couldn't imagine not using it,'' he said, ''so I push these worries to the back of my mind.''</p>
        <p>After several of the world's largest cell phone manufacturers, including companies like Nokia, Motorola and Ericsson, said last week that they planned to release more information on the radiation levels of their devices, it will be harder to ignore the debate over health risks and mobile phones.</p>
        <p>Even though federal agencies, relying on the results of various studies, say cell phones are safe, it is not surprising that concerns about the possible risks are increasing. Cell phones are emerging as perhaps the best-selling electronic device in the world. More than 400 million units are expected to be sold this year.</p>
        <p>Much of the debate has to do with the amount of radiation emitted.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission in 1996 established a level of 1.6 watts per kilogram -- or 2.2 pounds -- of human tissue as the highest amount of radio waves a device can emit when held against a given part of the body.</p>
        <p>Although devices currently available meet the F.C.C. standard, there is a lot of confusion as to what the level means.</p>
        <p>That has prompted the Cellular Telephone Industry Association, a group representing wireless companies, to provide more information on what the watts-per-tissue level means on pamphlets inside each package.</p>
        <p>Additionally, manufacturers will offer information on the packages that let consumers know that the device has been approved by the F.C.C., and will list addresses of government and corporate Web sites that provide more information.</p>
        <p>''We found there is a great deal of misinformation out there, so our aim is to provide as much transparency as possible,'' said Tom Wheeler, the president of the industry association, which is in Washington, D.C.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the topic of cell phones and health risks can be confusing. Almost all studies conducted have failed to show any conclusive evidence that cell phone use can cause cancer.</p>
        <p>Still, a few studies have linked cell phone use to the risk of brain cancer in laboratory animals. One study at the University of Adelaide in Australia showed that mice genetically predisposed to a type of cancer developed twice as many such cancers when exposed to cell phone radiation. The study was published in the journal Radiation Research in 1997.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, all sides in the debate have called for additional research. The industry association recently said it would spend $25 million to study possible cancer risks from cell phones.</p>
        <p>In light of recent rulings against tobacco companies, phone manufacturers may be able to shield themselves from the possibility of future legal action if they can show that they have tried to make users aware of any information related to radiation levels and cell phones.</p>
        <p>''It is simply smart for the companies to show they've done everything possible to ensure their devices are safe,'' said Mitchell Lazarus, a lawyer at Fletcher, Heald &amp; Hindreth in Arlington, Va., which specializes in telecommunications law.</p>
        <p>There are skeptics regarding the safety of cell phones.</p>
        <p>Most of these people point to the need to conduct long-term research, since cell phones have  been available on a widespread basis only since the 1980's.</p>
        <p>''On numerous occasions, microwave radiation from sources similar to cellular phones has been showed to increase the chances of cancer,'' said C. Ross Adey, a former professor of physiology at the Loma Linda School of Medicine. ''It is far too early in the game to say that cell phones are the harmless little objects the industry makes them out to be.''</p>
        <p>Anyone concerned with the potential health risks can take several steps to lessen the possibility of cancer, however distant it may be. Earphones keep the phone away from the brain, although a different part of the body could be exposed to radiation.</p>
        <p>Or cell phone users could simply opt to have shorter conversations, which would lower their exposure to radio waves. There are also a increasing number of shields being sold that are designed to protect the user from radiation, although some critics say the shields might actually increase exposure because some phones may need more radio-frequency energy to communicate with nearby towers.</p>
        <p>As for comparing the radiation levels of each phone, manufacturers and scientists seem to agree that this is somewhat of a useless exercise since the amount of radiation emitted can wary widely depending on where the device is used.</p>
        <p>For example, a cell phone used in Manhattan could have a higher radiation level because more energy is needed to communicate with a tower, given the interference from buildings. But even in these situations, the devices are below the F.C.C. limit of 1.6 watts per kilogram of human tissue, according to the Cellular Telephone Industry Association.</p>
        <p>In fact, said, Mr. Wheeler, the head of the manufacturers' association, few devices reach that level because it was established with a 50-fold margin of error and the energy they need rarely reaches that threshold.</p>
        <p>''We stand behind scientific consensus that no health risks have been demonstrated,'' said Norman Sandler, director of global strategic issues at Motorola. ''But we support the need for more research into the matter.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 4, 2000, Friday  An article in Circuits on July 27 about potential health risks of cellular telephone use misstated government agencies' findings. They have said that available evidence does not indicate whether cellular phones are safe or unsafe; the agencies have not said the phones are safe.</p>
