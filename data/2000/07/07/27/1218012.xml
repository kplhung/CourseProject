        <p>Flags flew at half-staff throughout Germany today as the country mourned its 96 victims aboard the Air France Concorde airliner that crashed Tuesday near Paris.</p>
        <p>''Germany is shaken and Germany is speechless,'' Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said at a memorial service in Hanover, where his cabinet had opted to hold its last weekly meeting before the summer vacation at the German pavilion in the Expo 2000 world's fair.</p>
        <p>Referring to the German passengers whose ill-fated flight was to have taken them to a luxury cruise embarking from New York, Mr. Schroder added: ''They were taken from life in the midst of a moment of joyful anticipation. France and Germany are united in respect for the victims and sympathy for the relatives.''</p>
        <p>More than 350 people, including most of Mr. Schroder's cabinet, attended the service, and many wept openly. Bishop Josef Homeyer asked simply, ''God, where were you in Paris?''</p>
        <p>The public outpouring of sentiment and the order from Interior Minister Otto Schily to lower all flags to half-staff were unusual in a generally reserved country that tends to shun displays of national emotion. ''Ninety-six Germans burned to death,'' screamed a headline in the mass-market Bild, above a photograph of the wreckage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schroder said he had received messages of condolences from throughout the world. His somber mood, on the eve of a three-week vacation in Majorca, contrasted with his ebullience earlier this week when he gave an upbeat midterm assessment of the work of his center-left government.</p>
        <p>The Foreign Ministry said it would not release the names of the passengers out of respect for the victims' families, who would face ''a thousand journalists'' if their identities were known. But a few details of the travelers, who had paid as much as $11,000 for the flight and planned cruise, emerged.</p>
        <p>The Bavarian automaker BMW, based in Munich, said the crash took the lives of a 57-year-old manager, his 36-year-old wife and their two children, aged 10 and 7. At the two children's school, classmates and teachers were in tears.</p>
        <p>In the northwestern city of Monchengladbach, city officials said 13 residents had been killed, six couples aged mostly between 50 and 70 and an 8-year-old child. The couples knew each other.</p>
        <p>The Foreign Ministry said 50 relatives of the dead had accepted an offer from Air France to fly to Paris. The first dozen of them were met in the French capital today by Reinhard Klimmt, the German transport minister.</p>
        <p>''Concorde has been one of the truly reliable planes,'' Mr. Klimmt said. ''But technology can fail and in this case it failed terribly.'' The transport minister, who is on the left of Mr. Schroder's Social Democratic Party, has in the past been critical of the way technological advances can threaten jobs.</p>
