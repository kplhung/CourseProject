        <p>Mr. King is trusting his readers to send him a dollar after each download . . . . If he does not receive payments for at least 75 percent of the downloads, he says, he will stop writing after two chapters, and readers won't learn the end.</p>
        <p>-- The New York Times  on Stephen King's plans to  publish a new book online.</p>
        <p>I will continue to write this e-book if . . .</p>
        <p>. . . I can be paid in cigarettes.</p>
        <p>. . . I can be assured that no critic will ever again, in connection with my work, employ the phrase ''amusing regional miniaturist.''</p>
        <p>. . . a reality-based television show can be built around my writing of the book.</p>
        <p>. . . the editorial assistant at my former publishing house -- the tall one, with the voice -- will make a series of fawning phone calls to my home between the hours of 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.</p>
        <p>. . . the next time I give a reading at a superstore, the management will rid the environment of spitty cappuccino machines, couples going through difficult break-ups, and storyteller-clowns.</p>
        <p>. . . in all previous reviews and criticism of my work, the word ''effective'' will be replaced with ''canonical.''</p>
        <p>. . . I can be assured that the book's publication will anger one of my competitors and lead to an exchange of increasingly petty correspondence in the letters section of a prominent book review, the publication of a snipey memoir or a lawsuit, preferably in London during the theater season.</p>
        <p>. . . my computer can be equipped to create, at my prompting, the sound of applause.</p>
