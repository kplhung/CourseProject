        <p>Researchers from Italy have provided the first genetic evidence linking sudden infant death syndrome to a rare heart disorder called long-QT syndrome, they are reporting today in The New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
        <p>Dr. Peter J. Schwartz, first author of the report and chairman of the cardiology department at the University of Pavia, estimated that the heart problem might account for 25 percent to 30 percent of sudden infant deaths, and he suggested that many babies could be saved if all newborns were given electrocardiograms to screen for the heart disorder. Those found to have it could then be given preventive treatment, usually drugs called beta blockers.</p>
        <p>American experts praised Dr. Schwartz's research but not his suggestion to screen all newborns. They warned that it would require testing thousands of healthy infants to save even one life and that some infants with ambiguous electrocardiograms would be given unneeded treatment for the heart disorder. Critics of the proposal also said there were not enough experts to read electrocardiograms on the nearly four million babies born each year.</p>
        <p>Dr. Julian Hoffman, a pediatric cardiologist at the University of California at San Francisco, estimated that if all babies were screened, it would cost $500,000 to save one life.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Schwartz said, ''If I were a parent, I wouldn't want my son to die just because we didn't do an electrocardiogram, and I wouldn't give a damn if we had to screen 1,000 to save my son.''</p>
        <p>Sudden infant death syndrome, also called SIDS or crib death, kills 7 in 10,000 babies in the United States, about 2,800 a year. The babies, seemingly healthy, die unexpectedly in their first year, usually in their sleep. The cause is not known, but many cases appear related to breathing problems, and in 1994 doctors began urging parents to put infants to bed on their backs rather than on their stomachs to avoid blocking their airways. In recent years, deaths from the disorder have fallen by about 40 percent.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schwartz said he and his colleagues had been studying another possible cause of SIDS since the early 1970's, heart-rhythm abnormalities. The focus of their interest is long-QT syndrome, an electrical abnormality in the heart that causes a greatly increased risk of sudden death in children and young people. It is rare, affecting only about 1 person in 10,000, and caused by any one of several genetic mutations.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, they did a study of 33,034 infants who had electrocardiograms at birth and were followed for a year. Of 24 babies who died of SIDS, half had long-QT syndrome. Over all, infants with the heart problem were 41 times more likely to die of SIDS than were those with normal electrocardiograms. But most babies with long-QT syndrome remained perfectly healthy. No genetic testing was done.</p>
        <p>At the time, Dr. Schwartz and other researchers did not recommend routine electrocardiograms for newborns. But they did recommend them for infants at high risk because of a family history of SIDS or long-QT syndrome, or a near-death from a heart or breathing problem resembling SIDS.</p>
        <p>Today's paper shows that family history cannot be trusted to identify high-risk babies. The article describes one case, in which parents found their 44-day-old son blue, not breathing and with no pulse. He was rushed to a hospital and revived, and survived without brain damage. His electrocardiogram showed long-QT syndrome, and genetic testing revealed a gene defect known to cause the heart problem.</p>
        <p>The striking thing about the case, the researchers said, was that neither parent had the gene defect, which therefore must have developed in the child as a spontaneous mutation. Theoretically, such a random mutation could strike anyone.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert J. Myerburg, director of cardiology at the University of Miami Medical Center, said of Dr. Schwartz: ''He has demonstrated that the long QT can be the basis for SIDS. What percentage of cases are accounted for by that mechanism is unknown. Schwartz probably thinks 30 percent. I think lower.''</p>
        <p>But even if the percentage were 10 percent, Dr. Myerburg said, treatment could still save a significant number of babies.</p>
        <p>But he agreed that routine screening of all newborns was impractical. It might become possible, he said, if software could be developed to help analyze electrocardiograms and single out abnormal ones needing expert analysis.</p>
