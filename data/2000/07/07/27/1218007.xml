        <p>Trying to mine some hope from the failed Camp David peace talks and prepare the ground for new negotiations, Egyptian officials today welcomed the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, for consultations on his way home from the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat did not treat himself immediately to an enthusiastic homecoming in Gaza, but instead flew to Alexandria, the summer retreat of the Egyptian government. There he briefed President Hosni Mubarak and Arab League officials on his two weeks of intensive negotiations with Israel over the contentious issues of Jerusalem, land and refugees.</p>
        <p>After nearly three hours of meetings, Mr. Arafat emerged and spoke defiantly at a news conference, accusing Israel of inflexibility and promising his host that one day they would both pray in an Arab-run Jerusalem, ''whether some people like it or hate it.''</p>
        <p>''We have run out of patience,'' he added. ''In fact, we are far beyond the limits of patience.''</p>
        <p>But his decision to fly directly to Mr. Mubarak, his closest ally in the ranks of often hostile Arab leaders and the one with the best relations with American officials, indicated that Mr. Arafat was already beginning his preparations for another plunge into negotiations before Sept. 13, the deadline he has given for his declaration of a Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>''It is not in Arafat's interest -- and it for sure is not in Egypt's interest or Jordan's or America's -- to have a unilateral declaration of statehood without a broader framework agreement,'' said an Egyptian official involved in the peace effort.</p>
        <p>''Now we have to act to limit the sense of despair about Camp David and prevent a deterioration of the situation,'' the official added.</p>
        <p>Egypt is expected to sponsor a round of consultations among Arab leaders to build support for Mr. Arafat as he and the Israelis try to rescue some accord from Camp David in the next seven weeks. King Abdullah II of Jordan, as well as several leaders of Persian Gulf states, are expected in Alexandria for meetings with Mr. Mubarak next week.</p>
        <p>If past crises in Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are a guide, Mr. Mubarak may also meet with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel to try to defuse tensions.</p>
        <p>President Mubarak has long played a pivotal role in garnering Arab support for talks with Israel. After 19 years in office, he has developed good relations with the United States and has acted as a mediator in Israel's sputtering negotiations with the Palestinians and with Syria.</p>
        <p>During the Camp David talks, he spoke with Mr. Arafat and with Mr. Barak by telephone. While many American officials in Washington have expressed disappointment that Mr. Mubarak did not press the Palestinians to accept a compromise on the difficult issue of Jerusalem, he did present the options on Jerusalem to other Arab leaders.</p>
        <p>The Egyptian president flew abruptly to Saudi Arabia, for example, last weekend, when the the talks appeared to have reached a particularly intense stage as specific proposals for partial administrative control over some sites in Jerusalem were offered by the Israelis.</p>
        <p>Political analysts in Cairo said Mr. Mubarak was testing the waters with Crown Prince Abdullah on the Israeli offer of partial Palestinian self-rule in the city.</p>
        <p>The Saudis, keepers of Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, apparently responded coolly to any compromise on full Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem and its Old City. After the trip, Mr. Mubarak gave his full support to Mr. Arafat's rejection of the Israeli plan, Mr. Mubarak's aides said.</p>
        <p>''When it comes to the issue of negotiating the status of Jerusalem, Arafat is too weak, personally and politically, to act on his own,'' said Wahid Abdel Maguid, the deputy director of Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo.</p>
        <p>''He is too weak even to take a decision to delay a decision,'' Dr. Abdel Maguid added. ''To make a decision you need a consensus between three or four big Arab countries, because it's a matter of historical responsibility.''</p>
        <p>There is no evidence that Mr. Mubarak, who still fears an Islamic fundamentalist insurgency at home, is interested in seeing Mr. Arafat accept less than full Palestinian sovereignty over the Arab part of Jerusalem and its mosques, which are sacred to Muslims all over the world.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mubarak does have the credibility to explore options that Mr. Arafat, who has a long history of rocky and mutually suspicious relations with his fellow Arab leaders, does not.</p>
        <p>As Egyptian president, Mr. Mubarak also has more influence over Mr. Arafat than any other leader, in part because Egypt has the least troublesome history with the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Jordan, under the late King Hussein, fought off an attempt by Palestinians under Mr. Arafat to take control of the country. Syria, under the late President Hafez al-Assad, sheltered and financed the radical Palestinian opposition to Mr. Arafat. Lebanon's civil war grew out of its battles with Palestinians.</p>
        <p>The Gulf countries expelled most Palestinian residents in 1990 to punish Mr. Arafat for support he offered to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who invaded Kuwait that year.</p>
        <p>''For Arafat and for most Palestinians, Egypt is the only Arab country which supported the Palestinians in their cause without interfering in their internal affairs and without committing any crimes against them,'' said Dr. Abdel Maguid. ''The Palestinians know Syria, Jordan, even forces within Lebanon, are responsible for many crimes. So there is a great confidence that Arafat can feel with Egypt that he cannot feel with any other Arab leader.''</p>
