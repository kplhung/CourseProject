        <p>Tile is bringing stylish design to restaurant dining rooms all over town. The right glazed white tiles give the chic Pastis its Parisian look. Guastavino takes its name from the terra cotta tiles that wrap its soaring vaults. Hugh Hardy of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, who designed Guastavino, said that ''after 10 years of display kitchens in restaurants, the kitchen has started extending its powers into the dining room.'' At Brasserie 8 1/2, which opened last week at 9 West 57th Street, Mr. Hardy collaborated with Joel Berman Glass Studios in Vancouver to create the iridescent yellow-orange wall tiles, left. ''We wanted something you'd see from the street, that would relate to the red 9,'' Mr. Hardy said, referring to the sidewalk icon by Ivan Chermayeff. The 6-by-6-inch tiles handcast of textured glass have an orange luminescent holographic film on the back; $65 each from Berman Studios, (888) 505-4527. His glass tiles without the optic film, 4 by 4 inches, are $9 each at Ann Sacks Tile and Stone, 5 East 16th Street.</p>
        <p>One in Blue on Blue</p>
        <p>For the Lincoln Center branch of Rosa Mexicano, which opened earlier this month, the architect David Rockwell of the Rockwell Group designed a two-story wall of iridescent blue glass tiles, ranging from pale sky blue to lavender to cobalt. Water trickles down the wall and over plaster divers imbedded there.</p>

Water trickles down the wall and over plaster divers imbedded there.</p>
        <p>''I chose the tiles because the color was surreally deep, and you had the feeling of being underwater,'' Mr. Rockwell said.</p>
        <p>As to those kitschy divers, he conceded, ''I'm not a minimalist.'' One-inch-square tiles are $26 a sheet. In 30 colors at Tiles -- A Refined Selection, 42 West 15th Street (Fifth Avenue), (212) 255-4450, and 227 East 59th Street (Third Avenue), (212) 813-9391.</p>
