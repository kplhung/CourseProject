        <p>SEE his picture on the front page of newspapers and magazines, catch him on the network news, read about him in newspaper editorials usually reserved for world-imposing figures and events and shake out the contents of a cereal box with his image on the front, and the theme is invariably the same: Lance Armstrong is a hero.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure what a hero is,'' he said yesterday, ''but I don't call myself a hero.''</p>
        <p>''I was dealt an unfortunate situation,'' he said. ''I did what came naturally, and tried hard. Hero? Some might think I'm a jerk. I push myself, and I push others -- like my teammates. Maybe that's part of the striving. Maybe that's a significant part of the story.''</p>
        <p>Lance Armstrong showed up in New York yesterday on his own two feet, which is and is not a surprise. He did not arrive on two wheels, which, for the winner of the Tour de France for the last two years, he is accustomed to doing. And the mere fact that he is around at all is a testament to those two good feet, and his heart, and, surely, modern medical science.</p>
        <p>Lance Armstrong, lean, short-cropped hair, yellow shirt symbolic of the leader of the great bicycle race, younger-looking than his 28 years, appeared at the Niketown store in Manhattan for a news conference, with fans packed in the atrium. It was part of a busy day that included the morning talk shows and the banging of the gavel to close trading at the New York Stock Exchange. And it came three days after his victory, which ended with him whisking down the Champs-Elysees in Paris, completing the grueling three-week, 2,774-mile outing.</p>
        <p>It is now a nearly commonplace story -- if a story endlessly inspiring to many can be termed commonplace -- how Armstrong was diagnosed in 1996 with testicular cancer, how it spread to his lungs and brain, and how he was given a 50 percent chance of surviving. He underwent brain surgery, then chemotherapy, lost his hair, lost his strength, lost 20 pounds, but did not lose hope.</p>
        <p>''I just wasn't going to be around people who thought I was going to die,'' said Armstrong. ''And there were those in medicine and out of it who thought I would. I switched to doctors who believed I could make it. I had to be around positive-thinking people.</p>
        <p>''I get letters and comments, from cancer survivors and others, saying they admire me,'' said Armstrong, ''and I appreciate that. But I can truthfully say I've never admired anyone I didn't really know well. I mean, you read about athletes, for example, who are great in their fields, but you don't know how they act at home, how they are when the spotlight isn't on them.''</p>
        <p>In one significant aspect he transcends such great athletes with whom he has been compared as Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky and Tiger Woods. The reason is, he is actively promoting and representing something beyond his sport, something above the sinking of a hoop or a putt. He has the Lance Armstrong Foundation for cancer research -- to which Nike contributed $25,000 yesterday -- and he consistently talked about the overcoming of obstacles, life-threatening and otherwise.</p>
        <p>(One is reminded of his mother, Linda, who raised him alone, telling him when he was feeling insecure in a race: ''You're going to win this race. Don't let anybody intimidate you -- you put your head down, and you race.'')</p>
        <p>If there is an athlete in recent memory that Armstrong most resembles in attitude and stature, it is Muhammad Ali, who made his personal beliefs a priority in the face of great obstacles and challenges.</p>
        <p>''All I know about Ali is what I've read,'' said Armstrong. ''I was too young to have known what he was doing.''</p>
        <p>What he was not too young to appreciate were Jordan's basketball skills and approach to his profession. ''And while I said you can't admire someone fully that you don't know, you can admire certain qualities in them,'' Armstrong said. ''And hard workers are people I look up to. Jordan was one of the hardest workers, as I understand it, and he drove the other guys on his team to achieve. He was tough on them. I try to do the same thing with my team.''</p>
        <p>Which has been plenty good not only for him, but for the winning U.S. Postal Service team that he led.</p>
        <p>He may also lead in perspective. ''It's important for me to know that something like the Lance Armstrong Foundation will be here in 20 years,'' he said, ''whereas the Tour de France will not be here in 20 years -- at least it won't for Lance Armstrong.''</p>
        <p>What next, though, for Lance Armstrong, cyclist? ''The Olympics,'' he said. ''That's big stuff. I go back into training on the weekend. I can't stop now.''</p>
