        <p>Compaq Computer has agreed to pay $4.5 million to settle claims that Digital Equipment, which it acquired in 1998, had overcharged the government for installing computer equipment, Justice Department officials said. Digital admitted in 1995 that it had submitted inflated labor costs to the Defense Department for work done in Orlando, Fla., and in Frankfurt. Government investigators subsequently found that Digital had also converted costs for some computer parts, shipping and warehousing into labor charges, billed travel time as direct costs and charged a higher billing rate for some work than the contract permitted, officials said.</p>
