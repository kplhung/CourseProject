        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Concerning your article ''Is the Customer Ever Right?'' (July 20), the most effective way of dealing with a legitimate and serious problem is to go right to the top. I purchased a cordless phone from Staples but didn't open it for six months. When I did, it had a defective handset. The receipt was lost, and the serial number indicated that it had been manufactured (but not bought) out of warranty. Customer service was of no help. I shipped the phone with an explanation directly to the president of the company. Within 24 hours, the problem was resolved and a new phone was on the way.</p>
