        <p>An affiliate of the YankeeNets is poised to complete its $175 million acquisition of the Devils in a week, and most likely by the end of next month.</p>
        <p>We have until Aug. 31, said Harvey Schiller, chairman of YankeeNets. He would not respond to a report quoting John McMullen, the Devils' owner, as saying the deal would be canceled if it does not close by Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>Puck Holdings was created by Lewis Katz and Raymond Chambers, principal investors in YankeeNets and board members of the company, to buy the Devils.</p>
        <p>Puck is solidifying deals with an expected six to eight more investors in the Devils, which has delayed the original July 12 closing. When those investments are in place, the deal with McMullen can close.</p>
        <p>Because of the structure of the YankeeNets, the National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association must approve the Devils' investors.</p>
        <p>McMullen was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying that YankeeNets had incurred a penalty for missing the July 12 date, but Schiller would not comment, citing a confidentiality agreement in the sale contract.</p>
        <p>YankeeNets has great incentive to satisfy McMullen, who remains in charge of the Stanley Cup champions, because financing a proposed arena in Newark is made easier with money from the Nets and the Devils.</p>
        <p>The Devils would also be a future programming option on a new cable sports channel being developed by YankeeNets with the International Management Group.</p>
