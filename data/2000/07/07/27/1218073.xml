        <p>Something was missing from the Yankees in the first three months this season, and maybe it was desperation. The Yankees were desperate to establish themselves in 1996, desperate to make their mark on history in 1998 and desperate to play through personal traumas in 1999.</p>
        <p>But they have added a few desperate souls in the last month, like Dwight Gooden, and they are beginning to pull away from their American League East rivals. Gooden collected his third victory tonight since joining the Yankees, shackling the Baltimore Orioles, 4-1, and finishing a three-game sweep with help from the relievers Jeff Nelson, Mike Stanton and Mariano Rivera. Paul O'Neill and David Justice each drove in two runs.</p>

        <p>Something was missing from the Yankees in the first three months this season, and maybe it was desperation. The Yankees were desperate to establish themselves in 1996, desperate to make their mark on history in 1998 and desperate to play through personal traumas in 1999.</p>
        <p>But they have added a few desperate souls in the last month, like Dwight Gooden, and they are beginning to pull away from their American League East rivals. Gooden collected his third victory tonight since joining the Yankees, shackling the Baltimore Orioles, 4-1, and finishing a three-game sweep with help from the relievers Jeff Nelson, Mike Stanton and Mariano Rivera. Paul O'Neill and David Justice each drove in two runs.</p>
        <p>That's four consecutive victories for the Yankees (54-42), 16 in their last 22 games. They are three games ahead of the Toronto Blue Jays, and three and a half ahead of the Boston Red Sox, whose game with the Minnesota Twins was rained out.</p>
        <p>The Yankees drubbed the Orioles by 18 runs on Tuesday, Baltimore's most one-sided defeat at Camden Yards, an embarrassment that apparently made no impression on Albert Belle. He was hitting in the first inning tonight, in Baltimore's first opportunity to rebound from that awful defeat, with Will Clark at first base, when he pulled a hard grounder into the shortstop hole.</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter lunged to intercept the ball, an astounding play that had those watching it thinking that Jeter might be able to throw out Clark at second -- which he did, with second baseman Jose Vizcaino stretching at the bag, like a first baseman, to make the catch.</p>
        <p>It probably never would have occurred to anyone that the Yankees might turn the double play.</p>
        <p>But Vizcaino is a former teammate of Belle's, and it occurred to Vizcaino that he had a chance. He turned and threw to first, completing the double play easily.</p>
        <p>Scouts in attendance timed Belle's saunter to first base at 4.9 seconds -- eons, by baseball standards, over the major league average for right-handed hitters of 4.1 or 4.2 seconds. Old and aching catchers run to first base in 4.9 seconds.</p>
        <p>While playing right field, Belle would bend over and place his hands on his knees as Sidney Ponson pitched, and sometimes would not move, even slightly, for several pitches at a time, as if he were still catching his breath from his first-inning jog.</p>
        <p>Gooden is competing with more anxiety than that, having found a beachhead for his career, now seven victories short of 200. Jorge Posada worked with Gooden in 1996 and 1997 and can attest to the change in Gooden. If the right-hander was behind in the count back then, Gooden almost uniformly challenged hitters with fastballs.</p>
        <p>But tonight Posada was calling for off-speed pitches when Gooden was in trouble, sliders and a changeup. Harold Baines whiffed on a slider in the second inning with a runner at third and flailed at a changeup with a runner at second in the fourth inning. B. J. Surhoff slapped unsuccessfully at a change with a runner at second in the sixth inning, resulting in a soft liner.</p>
        <p>''He can't rear back and throw the fastball past people,'' Posada said. ''He just can't do that any more. He's going to have to throw his other pitches; if he doesn't throw his others pitches for strikes, they're pretty much going to sit on his fastball.''</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, said, ''For him to have success, he had to change his approach.''</p>
        <p>Torre freely acknowledged that he never expected Gooden to make the impact that he has. Almost three weeks ago, he relieved Gooden after five innings against the Mets, unsure of whether the pitcher's performance was a mirage borne of good luck, or if Gooden was actually pitching well.</p>
        <p>Now Torre's trust in Gooden is growing, and he gave him a chance to pitch through a jam in the sixth inning, with the Yankees leading, 3-1. Belle stood at second and after Surhoff lined out for the second out, Gooden walked Jeff Conine, and Baines came to the plate as the potential go-ahead run.</p>
        <p>Baines fouled off several two-strike pitches before drawing a walk, and Torre called for Nelson, who retired Charles Johnson on a grounder with the bases loaded.</p>
        <p>The Orioles threatened in the seventh: first and second and one out, and Stanton stepped in for Nelson. Clark flied out for the second out, and Belle swung hard at a fastball and lifted a high pop into short center field.</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams, the Yankees' center fielder, was fooled by Belle's hack, taking a step back before hearing Jeter and Vizcaino screaming for him to come in for the ball. Williams sprinted forward, slid, reached and made the catch, closing out the seventh.</p>
        <p>This is what a most valuable player candidate does: Williams led off the very next inning by driving a ball over the center-field fence, something the umpires did not realize; they ruled the carom was in play when it came back on the field, and Williams settled for a triple, in spite of Torre's argument. (Williams mentioned to the umpires later that the replay showed they missed the call.)</p>
        <p>Justice singled to drive home Williams, and Stanton and Rivera pitched the last two innings to fetch Gooden victory No. 193. Just seven more. Gooden said he does not want to think about the number, but sometimes he cannot help but be drawn to it, as a desperate man -- among a group of players who are becoming more desperate, more driven, by the day.</p>
