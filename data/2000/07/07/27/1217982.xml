        <p>Former President Suharto will be charged with corruption in a few days, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marzuki, who has faced death threats and a bombing at his office while investigating Mr. Suharto, said his staff had finished compiling a thick dossier of evidence against the former strongman and would forward it to the state prosecutor.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully before August all will have been completed,'' he told reporters today after his staff met to draft the charges. ''Hopefully by the end of this month or early in August the dossiers would already have been handed over to the court.''</p>
        <p>A year ago, it seemed unthinkable that Mr. Suharto, the dominant political figure in modern Indonesian history, could be held accountable for his actions, let alone be hauled before a court. The former army general, who took office in 1966 and ruled for 32 years, was widely believed to control the country's judiciary, as well as other institutions like Parliament.</p>
        <p>Investigators and critics say Mr. Suharto abused his office to amass a fortune while also enriching his children and business associates.</p>
