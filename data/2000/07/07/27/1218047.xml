        <p>Like a number of lesbian couples, Christine T. and Janis C. wanted children. They were blessed with two, a boy and a girl, now 4 and 2. Christine was  ''Mommy,'' Janis was ''Momma,'' and the children used both women's surnames. The couple decided that Janis would support the family while Christine stayed at home in Harrison, N.Y., with the children.</p>
        <p>When the relationship soured, however, it was Christine's status as the biological mother that emerged as the only pertinent fact, both in her eyes and, her lawyer argued, in the eyes of the law. And Janis, who had never adopted the children, found herself suing in Family Court here for the right to see the children. The women asked that their last names not be published so that the children's privacy would be protected.</p>
        <p>The case illustrates just how murky the issue of visiting rights can be for households like Christine and Janis's, which are becoming increasingly common. Courts in only a handful of states, including New Jersey, have allowed the so-called psychological parent visiting privileges after a gay or lesbian relationship ends.</p>
        <p>''Across the country, we see these kinds of custody disputes all over the place -- it's epidemic,'' said Beatrice Dohrn, legal director of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a nonprofit gay rights group. ''Conventional family law is a huge safety net that lesbian and gay couples don't have.''</p>
        <p>This month, Judge Joan O. Cooney of State Family Court entered new legal ground when she temporarily granted Janis visiting rights -- a first for a same-sex couple in New York State. Previously, trial judges had relied on a 1991 ruling by the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, which found that a same-sex partner who has neither adopted nor given birth to a child does not have parental rights under the state's Domestic Relations Law.</p>
        <p>Carolyn H. Mann, the Port Chester, N.Y., lawyer who represents Christine, won an immediate stay of the order from the State Supreme Court's Appellate Division, pending appeal. And if Judge Cooney grants permanent visiting rights after further hearings scheduled for September, that ruling could well be overturned on appeal.</p>
        <p>Such disputes are much more common with lesbian couples than with male couples, Ms. Dohrn said. Gay men typically adopt their children, and very often both partners adopt. But in lesbian relationships, one woman typically gives birth to the child, so the child is legally and unquestionably hers. That link makes adoption by the other partner less urgent, Ms. Dohrn said, so some lesbian couples do not pursue the matter right away, if ever.</p>
        <p>''Adoption is time consuming and costs money,'' and many couples do not anticipate a messy separation,  Ms. Dohrn said, adding that she knew of relationships that broke up after adoption papers were filed but before the adoption was approved.</p>
        <p>In 1995, the State Court of Appeals ruled definitively that state law permitted ''second parent'' adoption. In that decision, the court said that couples, whether homosexual or heterosexual, need not be married in order for one partner to adopt the other's children. Since then, gay rights groups say, many gay and lesbian couples have chosen to cement their bonds and protect one partner from being cut off from the children by pursuing dual adoptions, although exact numbers are unavailable because adoption records are sealed.</p>
        <p>In the case in Westchester County, however, Janis had not adopted the boy and girl. (Joan Iacono, a lawyer in Bronxville, N.Y., who specializes in family law and represents Janis, says Janis intended to adopt when her finances improved.) This is why she now finds herself fighting over her standing even to seek visiting rights, rather than becoming embroiled in a custody battle.</p>
        <p>But like a custody battle, the court dispute between her and Christine is filled with unseemly accusations. In court testimony, Christine said Janis had berated her by calling her a ''fat pig'' and dragged the children around the house. Christine also alleged that she was forced to go on welfare and, after accumulating $65,000 in credit card debt, to declare bankruptcy as a result of Janis's inability to hold on to a job.</p>
        <p>Janis denied the accusations, asserting that they were a happy, loving family, though conceding there were occasional arguments. Her lawyer, Ms. Iacono, said Janis did resign from at least one job as a corporate recruiter while she was struggling with a debilitating illness.</p>
        <p>In her decision, Judge Cooney relied on a set of criteria used in New Jersey and Wisconsin to determine whether a sufficient parent-child bond had been established. She ruled that there was such a bond, based on Christine's encouraging a relationship between Janis and the children, and the duration of that relationship, among other things.</p>
        <p>Having ruled earlier in this case that visiting is as much the child's right as the parent's right, Judge Cooney based her decision to grant temporary visiting rights on the legal doctrine of ''equitable estoppel,'' which has been used to allow stepparents to visit children who are not theirs biologically.</p>
        <p>Her ruling was lauded by gay rights organizations as a sign that gay and lesbian families were getting some protection from the courts. ''In prior cases, judges have been deaf to any facts or evidence because they can't get past the fact that it's a lesbian family,'' said Laura Newman, executive director of the Loft, the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center, a nonprofit organization in White Plains. ''It's wonderful that Judge Cooney is treating this family like every other family.''</p>
        <p>But Christine's lawyer, Ms. Mann, said the decision trampled on the sacrosanct rights of biological parents, adding that she was ''truly baffled by the court's decision, respectful but baffled.'' She said Janis had forfeited any parental rights by not adopting the children, adding that there was no adoption in progress at the time of the breakup.</p>
        <p>''Christine had the option of allowing someone to adopt her children, and she chose not to for whatever reason,'' Ms. Mann said. ''How many lovers have given support to their friends? It does not confer any rights. It just doesn't. This isn't a question of judgment. It's a question of cold law.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Iacono, Janis's lawyer,  counters that Christine had given Janis permission to adopt the children in a joint will that was retracted after their breakup in November. Janis last saw the children eight months ago, she said.</p>
        <p>''She was traumatically torn from them, and they were traumatically torn from her,'' Ms. Iacono said. ''If you have two parents, you deserve the love of both parents.''</p>
