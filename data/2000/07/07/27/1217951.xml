        <p>IN the arc of a flashlight beam, Patrick McCue held up a lump of caliche, a crusty calcium-rich soil, and set it against the rough-edged earthen wall of his new house.</p>
        <p>''Here we were, stumbling to get this stuff out of the way, and we ended up making the house to look just like it,'' he said. Mr. McCue, 40, a captain in the Phoenix Fire Department, whose fiery red hair blends seamlessly into his sunburnt face, kicked a few rocks out of the spot of light and set down a metal kitchen chair for his wife, Marika, 37, who is a fire captain herself.</p>
        <p>It was about 10 p.m. and 100 degrees in the quiet neighborhood sprawling around the base of Squaw Mountain, a jagged landmark. A full moon was rising over a distant ridge. The only other light was a sizzling spray of sparks bouncing off metal being welded nearby.</p>
        <p>After two grueling years of construction, day and night, the McCue house is nearing completion on a work cycle squeezed between shifts: 24 hours at the firehouse, followed by 48 hours on the building site.</p>
        <p>''We've done nothing social, we don't celebrate birthdays, our families are upset with us, but who else is going to do the work?'' Ms. McCue said, shrugging broad swimmer's shoulders. ''It's a matter of 'Let's dig in.' ''</p>
        <p>Five volunteers -- fellow firefighters and an architecture student from Arizona State University -- were picking up tools and tossing leftover Chuy's tacos in the trash, finishing, by hand and in their off-duty hours, a radical work of residential architecture.</p>
        <p>The four-room, 2,400-square-foot McCue house is made from 75 percent salvaged material, including trusses rejected from a ballpark, high-quality but scratched glass donated by a house-building friend and surplus steel picked up at junkyards. The walls are of poured earth, and the roof is a polyvinyl tent fabric, hovering, lightweight and taut as a spider web. This is the first American home to use tensile fabric in a starring role, according to Ferrari, the French manufacturer.</p>
        <p>In a day when architectural zing often comes with the ring of a multimillion-dollar price tag, the McCue house shows that those of modest means can still innovate. The desert's vistas have challenged architectural pioneers for much of the century.</p>
        <p>The house was designed by Marwan Al-Sayed, an architect born in Baghdad, with Mies Grybaitis, a glass artist. Curators at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York selected the project while it was still in germination for inclusion in ''Design Culture Now,'' an exhibition of groundbreaking work that is running through Aug. 6.</p>
        <p>''I fell in love with the sensuous quality of the house,'' said Donald Albrecht, a curator. ''There are those adobelike walls of the desert. Then the super-duper modern roof system. It's like transplanting the ancient desert architecture of one culture and adding it to the modern desert architecture of another.''</p>
        <p>So far, it has cost the couple more than the $300,000 they budgeted to build their house, which they have scrappily financed with short-term construction loans and a lot of overtime. And no small human cost.</p>
        <p>If the house inspired design aficionados while still on paper, it brought about more than a few extraordinary feats of communal devotion at the site itself. Friends with no particular attraction to avant-garde architecture quickly realized that this house was going to be special. And they wanted to be part of it.</p>
        <p>In addition to the firefighters, the labor force included Terry McCue, Mr. McCue's brother, who has done much of the welding. After an accident on the site partly severed ligaments, tendons and nerves in his wrist, he lost sensation in his hand but continues to work. ''If we could have escaped that, we would have been home free,'' Ms. McCue said, still shaken.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCue's mother is sewing translucent fabric to be used in place of glass or paneling for the few interior doors -- more like shades, really -- in the mostly open-plan house. His father has been recording the project in photos for a book.</p>
        <p>For an experimental house, it is shaped simply: part monumental earthwork, part railroad flat. Its rectangular mass -- 25 feet wide and 100 feet long -- straddles the bed of a dried-out creek, or wash, which can fill during a severe summer thunderstorm. The 18-inch-thick walls render the house solidly earthbound, while the silvery two-ply tent roof sweeps as high as 14 feet overhead -- a permanent cloud, tethered by rope and steel, giving luminous shade to the interior. By day, the temperature drops -- if not precipitously, at least notably -- as one steps out of the broiling sunlight into the ever so slightly blue-tinged spaces.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to reduce things to their purest level,'' said Mr. Al-Sayed, 38, who received an architecture degree at Columbia University and studied desert culture in the Sahara on a traveling fellowship. ''Coming from the culture that I do, I'm especially interested in issues of the earth and the sky and how to bring them into the architecture. It's a different relationship to the out-of-doors than you find in the classic American house, which is a lot more internally oriented.''</p>
        <p>His plan was to make a house of substantial mass that was flooded with light, and he drew inspiration from a line in an Egyptian film he recalled: ''Mamam, Mamam, the moon is at the door. Should I let her in or shut the door?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Al-Sayed has given the house a name, the House of Earth and Light, and Ms. Grybaitis, his collaborator and fiancee, has cast that name into a green-glass illuminated cornerstone at the front of the house. Although Mr. Al-Sayed spent more than 10 years in the New York office of Tod Williams and Billie Tsien and was the project architect for their expansion of the Phoenix Museum of Art, this will be his first solo building.</p>
        <p>''We knew we were going out on a limb with this house,'' said Ms. Grybaitis, 32, who came to the United States from Australia four years ago. ''In terms of our career, it was either going to be the end or it was going to be the beginning.''</p>
        <p>For the irrepressible McCues, the project was a response to their frustration with the stiflingly standardized development common in Phoenix. Indeed, seen from an airplane flying over the flat-as-a-frying-pan landscape, many residential lots look more like hotdog buns on a tray than houses. The McCues used to live in one such ranchburger. And no sooner had they finished four years of renovating it than Mr. McCue started saying to himself: ''Is this all there is? I'm not happy.''</p>
        <p>The couple promptly sold the house and used the money to buy land in Alta Vista, a small, iconoclastic neighborhood just east of the golf course of the famed Biltmore Hotel, partly designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The neighborhood had its own architectural pedigree, with three Wright houses, including a burned-out ruin left standing, along with recent construction by Mr. Williams and Ms. Tsien, and a copper-finned, drum-shape home by Will Bruder, also of Phoenix.</p>
        <p>''We knew this neighborhood could accommodate something different,'' said Mr. McCue, who is also an inventor and metal artist. ''And that anything we built wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Al-Sayed met the McCues just about when he and Ms. Grybaitis decided they had had enough of Phoenix. Mr. Al-Sayed had arrived in 1994 to work on the museum. When the project was completed, he headed back to New York, where an apartment he had renovated caused a stir, centered on a sun court in the middle of its living room. It was a glass canyon open to rain, snow and, probably, falling ash from trash-burning. Then they met the McCues.</p>
        <p>IT might be said that Mr. Al-Sayed's inspiration for the house was a telephone pole. ''There are few bus shelters in Phoenix,'' the architect said. ''And I started noticing how people would line up in the shade of a telephone pole just to get out of the sun. Shade is like water here. It's a precious commodity.''</p>
        <p>His idea was to design a house that took advantage of the extraordinary  light in Phoenix, while shading the inhabitants from light's harsher effects. Thus, the tent, a roofing material that had already proved itself viable in places like Denver International Airport and the Haj Terminal of the King Abdul Aziz International Airport in Jidda, Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Al-Sayed came up with a layered system: the top skin of fire-resistant polyvinyl material would deflect more than 80 percent of the radiant heat; a second skin of coated polyvinyl is waterproof. When cleaning time comes, this firefighting couple will just pull out the power hose.</p>
        <p>''Ten years ago, none of this technology was even available,'' said Mr. Al-Sayed, who even in the biblical heat of Phoenix was layered in a long-sleeved shirt and an undershirt (a self-insulating trick that his father taught him after years of working in Saudi Arabia).</p>
        <p>A soft light pierces the roof, making it possible to see the shadows of birds and planes as they fly overhead. Mr. McCue and his brother made the trusses from salvage recovered for $300 from Phoenix's Bank One ballpark, with its high-tech retractable dome.</p>
        <p>If the roof aspires to near-weightlessness, the thick walls go for bold monumentality. Originally, the architect considered the ancient technique of rammed earth, but rejected it as too labor-intensive and cavelike. He settled on poured earth, laced with his own recipe of cement plus soil, which is sloughed into wooden molds. It is an unforgiving medium and requires huge forethought: every window and door opening, plumbing and electrical passage, even the placement of switch plates, had to be determined before the house was cast as a solid piece of earth.</p>
        <p>Inside, the designers have made something surreal out of the everyday. Mr. Al-Sayed counts Federico Fellini as an inspiration. What could be more contradictory than fortress walls, a gossamer roof and cast glass? But they all mesh seamlessly. The entry door is more than eight feet tall, made of bottle-green glass cast by Ms. Grybaitis, using a section of street grating as her mold.</p>
        <p>The entire slot-shape house is exposed upon entry, with the living room off to the left. There, the solid masonry gives way to wide glass windows on both sides, offering views, partly obscured by the hilly terrain and Squaw Mountain. (Imagine Philip Johnson's glass house, circa 1000 B.C.) To the right, the bedroom is partly concealed by a glass container, which serves as a walk-in closet.</p>
        <p>The house is positioned with its narrow end facing west, to minimize the full brunt of the sun. A six-foot overhang of roof fabric shades the south side, lest the living room turn into a sauna. A swimming pool for Ms. McCue, who races competitively, will lap the exterior wall of their bedroom, an idea Mr. Al-Sayed borrowed from a Moroccan hotel that was once a sultan's palace. He has included a slot window at the foot of the bed for pool gazing.</p>
        <p>Between the open living room and the bedroom is a study, more like a conversation pit, sunk into the concrete, with a low window for peering out at the desert floor. Bookcases were molded directly into the earthen walls.</p>
        <p>Reduced to haiku simplicity, the house nevertheless has endless complexity and engrossing nuance, from its steel toggle light switches, reminiscent of the early houses of Le Corbusier and other modern pioneers, to the constantly fluctuating shadows of trusses, which mark the passage of the day like sundials.</p>
        <p>At twilight, even those massive walls seem to prickle with light: Ms. McCue has cut 300 discs of glass to fit deftly into the holes left by dowels during the casting. Ms. Grybaitis taught her how to use a glass drill.</p>
        <p>On a hot evening last week, Ms. McCue, one of the first women to become a firefighter in Phoenix, was eager to move in at last. ''We've got to get it done,'' she said. They have been living with their yellow Labrador in a horse trailer parked on the site. ''Some nights, my ankles are hurting, my knuckles are dragging in the dirt, and I think I can't do this any longer. But somehow we do keep pushing.''</p>
        <p>When she and her husband finally move into their house, in two weeks, there is no doubt how she will respond when the moon comes calling. She will welcome it through the open glass door, the windows, the pierced walls -- and most especially through the diaphanous sheltering roof.</p>
