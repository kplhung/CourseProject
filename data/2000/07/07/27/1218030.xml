        <p>At the National Football League coaching symposium in Baltimore last May, the Giants decided on a plan that would change one man's life and potentially affect many more. St. Louis Coach Dick Vermeil, still glowing from his Super Bowl victory, was asked for the biggest reason his team won the championship. He didn't cite the arm of quarterback Kurt Warner or the speed of his defense. He talked about a person in the Rams' front office who was the team's troubleshooter, the one whom players confided in when turmoil was brewing in their lives. Without him, Vermeil said, the Rams never would have made it to the big game.</p>
        <p>Vermeil's words confirmed what the Giants' organization had been thinking. They needed someone who could move with ease in the world of players, someone players would respect, but also a man who would protect the interest of the organization. When Charles Way's knee finally succumbed to the rigors of pro football, forcing him into retirement this spring after five years as one of the best fullbacks in the game, the Giants knew they had their man. Way left the field and became a front office executive, the director of player development. And now, players maintain that Way is one of the Giants' most valuable commodities. ''I knew it was going to be a good move with Charles,'' General Manager Ernie Accorsi said yesterday. ''I didn't know it would be this good. I knew he has class and a great work ethic, but he's been fantastic.''</p>

        <p>At the National Football League coaching symposium in Baltimore last May, the Giants decided on a plan that would change one man's life and potentially affect many more. St. Louis Coach Dick Vermeil, still glowing from his Super Bowl victory, was asked for the biggest reason his team won the championship. He didn't cite the arm of quarterback Kurt Warner or the speed of his defense. He talked about a person in the Rams' front office who was the team's troubleshooter, the one whom players confided in when turmoil was brewing in their lives. Without him, Vermeil said, the Rams never would have made it to the big game.</p>
        <p>Vermeil's words confirmed what the Giants' organization had been thinking. They needed someone who could move with ease in the world of players, someone players would respect, but also a man who would protect the interest of the organization. When Charles Way's knee finally succumbed to the rigors of pro football, forcing him into retirement this spring after five years as one of the best fullbacks in the game, the Giants knew they had their man. Way left the field and became a front office executive, the director of player development. And now, players maintain that Way is one of the Giants' most valuable commodities. ''I knew it was going to be a good move with Charles,'' General Manager Ernie Accorsi said yesterday. ''I didn't know it would be this good. I knew he has class and a great work ethic, but he's been fantastic.''</p>
        <p>It is difficult to judge just how fantastic because Way cannot discuss much of what he does because he must protect the confidentiality of the players. But several Giants players said Way has already had a significant impact in his new job. They say Way has kept several starters from hurting their careers by counseling them through embarrassing personal situations, though no one will give exact details. He has also helped, the players said, guide at least one through a difficult marital crisis.</p>
        <p>''Having Charles around is like having a best friend, a big brother and father figure all wrapped up in one,'' one Giants veteran said. ''Right now I would say he is one of the most important guys on our team.''</p>
        <p>The N.F.L. is at a critical stage. The recent rash of player violence has tarnished the league's image. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue urged owners and team executives this off-season to address the problem on a team level. The Giants did their part by hiring Way.</p>
        <p>Way has earned the trust of Giants players so quickly because he was one of them. He was perhaps the most trusted presence in the locker room during his career.</p>
        <p>''All I do now is try to build on that trust,'' Way said yesterday. ''Now when a player comes to me, I'm a team executive, but I'm not a coach, so I can't affect their playing time, and I'm also not a general manager, so I can't affect their contractual status. I'm someone who listens and tries to solve problems.''</p>
        <p>It may sound too simplistic, or exaggerated, but Way, and others in his position, like Carl Banks with the Jets, are vital in the league's fight to keep its players out of trouble. A general manager or coach can talk for hours about how a player needs to be responsible off the field and make smart choices, but all players tend to hear is static. But when someone of Way's status speaks, players focus. He was one of us. He's been there. He knows. Yet Way understands he won't reach every player. There are some, as in every walk of life, who simply do not get it, and do not care.</p>
        <p>Way faces another challenge. Right now, players trust him implicitly. But what if, for example, a player calls Way and says he was at a party, and just tried drugs for the first time? At that point, the player told him something in confidence, but the organization would probably need to be told.</p>
        <p>''You handle things on a case-by-case basis,'' Way said. ''But the main concern is the player. In that instance you have to tell them the team may need to know this, because it could end up in the newspaper. But I would go to the team and say: 'This is the situation. The player and I are handling it.' ''</p>
        <p>The Giants are giving Way lots of latitude because they trust him as much as the players do. Way is also sitting in on many of the front office meetings and learning every aspect of how a football team is run. There is little question Way is being groomed to became a general manager. And he doesn't shy away from the notion.</p>
        <p>''But right now my focus is on these players,'' he said. ''This is where I want to be.''</p>
        <p>The Giants could not agree more.</p>
