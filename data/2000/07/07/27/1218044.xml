        <p>A stroller enters Central Park through Mariner's Gate at 85th Street. She passes a playground on her left and Summit Rock on her right. Turning left onto West Drive, she crosses the bridle path and heads toward the Great Lawn.</p>
        <p>Before the Civil War, the views were very different. Walking east on 85th Street, a stroller would see farms and stables. He would pass All Angels' Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church cemetery and the African Union Methodist Church. There was no Great Lawn; 85th Street ended at the Croton Receiving Reservoir. But that was before Seneca Village, a community of more than 260 people that once stood between Seventh and Eight Avenues from 82nd to 89th Streets, was razed to make way for Central Park in 1857.</p>
        <p>Eight years ago, when Diana Wall, a professor of anthropology at City College, learned of Seneca Village, she asked the question any archaeologist would ask: Is anything left of it underground? Now she and a team of researchers are coming closer to answering that question.</p>
        <p>Although it is too early to say definitively what their work adds up to, the researchers say there is mounting evidence that there are indeed some building foundations underground, particularly where All Angels' Church once stood. They will present their findings in the park near the West 85th Street entrance tomorrow at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.</p>
        <p>Since early June, Dr. Wall and other researchers have been poking and prodding the gentle, grassy slopes of Central Park with electrical currents, electromagnetic waves and ground-penetrating radar -- everything but digging down.</p>
        <p>Their goal is to use imaging techniques traditionally applied to oil fields or cancerous tumors to determine whether there are any building foundations, skeletons or other physical remains from the village.</p>
        <p>A dig, of course, would provide more definitive answers. But Dr. Wall and the other researchers recognized that a major excavation among the park's heavily populated playgrounds and pathways seemed unlikely to win support, an attitude reinforced by conversations with Parks Department officials.</p>
        <p>Still, if the Seneca Village investigators find convincing evidence of physical remains, they will seek permission to do some limited digging. (The group also includes Nan A. Rothschild, an anthropology professor at Barnard; Cynthia R. Copeland, an expert on Seneca Village at the New-York Historical Society; Roelof J. Versteeg, a geophysicist at Columbia University; Herbert Seignoret, a City College graduate student; and nine student interns.) They would focus on a few small spots that look most promising, like a house or a well that might yield clues to what people ate or wore, and the site would be covered over within days.</p>
        <p>''If we can actually do some archaeology, we will be able to say something about how people were living there that cannot be discovered in any other way,'' Dr. Wall said.</p>
        <p>Parks officials are noncommittal.  Alan M. Moss, first deputy commissioner of parks, said: ''Our preference is not to dig up the park, but it would depend on the kind of evidence they put forward. If it were a fishing expedition, I don't think we would be receptive. But we don't want to stand in the way of science. We would have to be convinced that what they want to do was in the best interest of science and the park.''</p>
        <p>In 1991, the discovery of the 18th-century Negro Burial Ground and the painstaking removal of the graves delayed construction of a federal office tower in Lower Manhattan. Dr. Wall said her group did not want to excavate any graves, but might want to mark or commemorate them in some way.</p>
        <p>Of all the communities uprooted by the creation of Central Park, Seneca Village was the largest and most densely populated. The seven-square-block area was home not only to many free African-Americans in the decades before the Civil War, but also to a scattering of poor Irish and German immigrants.</p>
        <p>In their book, ''The Park and the People: A History of Central Park'' (Cornell University Press, 1992), Roy Rosenzweig and Elizabeth Blackmar argued that Seneca Village's inhabitants were not the vagabonds and squatters suggested by news accounts at the time, but a stable community of working people.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Ms. Copeland helped mount an exhibit on Seneca Village at the New-York Historical Society. The show was such a hit that 300 people showed up for a walking tour of the Seneca Village area in Central Park in a snowstorm.</p>
        <p>Yet Ms. Copeland was not satisfied; she wanted more physical evidence of the village and began to talk to Dr. Wall and Dr. Rothschild about ways to gather it. ''I can't imagine the city without the park,'' Ms. Copeland said, ''but it does have a history, and people can learn from it.''</p>
        <p>One challenge, Dr. Rothschild said, is ''thinking about how one would do an evaluation of whether there was anything there.''</p>
        <p>With grants from City College, Columbia University and the National Science Foundation, Ms. Copeland and the two professors expanded their team. Working with Dr. Versteeg and another geophysicist, Bruce Bevan, they did some trial runs using above-ground sensing techniques. And, this summer, they took on nine summer interns.</p>
        <p>The interns -- an eclectic group ranging in age from 18 to over 50 -- have spent weeks combing through 19th-century deeds, tax records and newspapers. They have also provided much of the muscle to gather the physical data in the park.</p>
        <p>Their work in the park began inauspiciously. It rained for two days. A dog bit an intern. But last week, as two interns methodically marked off a 30- by 40-meter area they wanted to investigate, the sun smiled.</p>
        <p>Navigating around giant maple trees and evergreens, the students -- Oscar Olivo from Columbia University and Siobhan Cooke from Barnard -- ran thin white measuring tape up and down grassy humps and over sprawling boulders to mark the research area. They drove thin metal probes -- 32 in all -- into the ground along one side of the rectangle, and attached each to a control box with long wires.</p>
        <p>In an hour, they collected about 350 measurements of the electrical resistivity beneath the ground. Then they started again: unhooking the clips, moving the probes, reattaching the electrodes and waiting some more. The data were later entered into computers at the Mudd engineering building at Columbia.</p>
        <p>The students used another set of equipment to measure the ground conductivity using electromagnetic waves. As the bees buzzed around the clover at her feet, Ms. Cooke stopped every two feet to call out readings from the box she was carrying with long poles sticking out from each side. Mr. Olivo recorded each reading.</p>
        <p>At the group's base camp, under a towering oak tree, Nina Finch, a City College student from Denmark, prepared to use ground-penetrating radar to take other readings.</p>
        <p>Marina Massey, a senior at Lehman College, carried the cumbersome H-shaped antennae that would receive the radar signals and send them to the computer Ms. Finch was carrying.</p>
        <p>They paced along the tape, stopped, and then tried again. The equipment was not behaving.</p>
        <p>After several tries, Ms. Finch marched over to Dr. Versteeg.</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry, Roelof, but it just doesn't work,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Maybe you're sending bad vibes,'' he joked.</p>
        <p>''I had very happy vibes when I started this,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As he scrutinized the laptop, the screen showed some data, including  signs of a formation in the ground. Could it be the outline of something 150 years old? Dr. Versteeg was skeptical. His guess: probably a utility line. But, he added later, ''that's a preliminary interpretation.''</p>
        <p>In all, the group has taken soundings on about 25,000 square feet, or about a tenth of Seneca Village.</p>
        <p>Despite the odd-looking equipment in the park, few of the people passing by seemed to notice the scientists.</p>
        <p>One who did was Steve Villalobos, a husky man in sunglasses walking a silky chow on a leash. ''Any land mines there?'' he yelled.</p>
        <p>When told about the project, he applauded the work and said he would support a dig: ''It wouldn't bother me; there's a lot of park.''</p>
        <p>Interpreting the data is more like solving a puzzle than reading a book. First, the data must be transformed into computerized maps that show areas where there seem to be disruptions or ''anomalies'' that suggest the presence of something solid in the soil.</p>
        <p>To try to determine whether the anomalies are remnants of Seneca Village or modern-day power lines, those maps must be compared with surveys from the 1800's showing property lines and buildings, and recent maps showing where utility lines are supposed to be.</p>
        <p>Dr. Versteeg says there is no more certainty in the data than there is in a mammogram of a woman's breasts. Radar, for example, does not seep as easily through Central Park soil as it does through dry desert sand. And unlike a spot in a desert that has been untouched for centuries, Central Park is heavily used and has been landscaped and relandscaped.</p>
        <p>Also, some of the magnetic readings appear to have been affected by the nearby subway lines. And, as Dr. Versteeg cautioned the students, ''Just because you have a utility map doesn't mean it's accurate.''</p>
        <p>He explained that the maps were sometimes misleading because the people laying utility lines often redirected them when they encountered rocks and other obstacles.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rothschild said that even without the ground readings, the documentary research had shed new light on the lives of the Seneca Village inhabitants.</p>
        <p>''I noticed while I was looking at the death records, that the African-Americans were born at home while the Irish and Germans were born at Bellevue Hospital,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But the researchers still yearn for tangible evidence of the past. They know they have no assurances that they will ever be allowed to excavate, but they remain hopeful.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wall laughed. ''It's very political,'' she said. ''But I would like to think it will happen.''</p>
