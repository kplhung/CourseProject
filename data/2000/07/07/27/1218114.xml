        <p>For the first time since 1997, the Islanders will face the Rangers in a preseason game, scheduled to be played in Hartford on Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>The Islanders will open their preseason on Sept. 14-15 with back-to-back games against the Flyers at Trenton and Philadelphia, then face the Stanley Cup champion Devils at the Nassau Coliseum on Sept. 20 in their lone home exhibition.</p>
        <p>They also play the Washington Capitals at Richmond on Sept. 23 and conclude the preseason at New Jersey on Oct. 2.</p>
        <p>Every one of the six games is against one of our top rivals, so that should bring the emotion out, Coach Butch Goring said. I also like the breakdown of two games a week. That way we can have several practices in a row, see how we do in games and then get back to work at practice.</p>
