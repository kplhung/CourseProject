        <p>In ''Fiends Angelical,'' a Paul Taylor dance piece that received its premiere on Tuesday at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, a man and woman in an energetic tribe go at each other's throats. After their mutual strangulation, the local priestess, with horns on her head, bites apart the long red gut that has been pulled out of the happy couple's innards.</p>
        <p>Not to worry. What would a Paul Taylor ritual dance be without transformation? The priestess gets on with it and revives the pair as the Kronos Quartet's recording of George Crumb's ''Black Angels'' brings to an end its screeching and lyrical strings, studded with vocal clucks.</p>

        <p>In ''Fiends Angelical,'' a Paul Taylor dance piece that received its premiere on Tuesday at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, a man and woman in an energetic tribe go at each other's throats. After their mutual strangulation, the local priestess, with horns on her head, bites apart the long red gut that has been pulled out of the happy couple's innards.</p>
        <p>Not to worry. What would a Paul Taylor ritual dance be without transformation? The priestess gets on with it and revives the pair as the Kronos Quartet's recording of George Crumb's ''Black Angels'' brings to an end its screeching and lyrical strings, studded with vocal clucks.</p>
        <p>''Fiends Angelical'' is a dance of extremes in the same spirit that both puzzles and provokes. Its means of expression, a tongue so firmly held in cheek and in check that it hurts, is its most fascinating aspect.</p>
        <p>The piece is hardly one of Mr. Taylor's crowd pleasers, and Santo Loquasto's Afro wigs, headbands and dyed leotards do it a disservice. Yet if one focuses on the choreography rather than on the piece's meaning, the desperate urgency of the movement is as impressive as its inventiveness.</p>
        <p>Jacob's Pillow commissioned ''Fiends Angelical'' as part of a weeklong 70th-birthday tribute to Mr. Taylor. His birthday is on Saturday, and the Paul Taylor Dance Company previously presented him with the first of the several cakes he can have and eat too at a press preview of ''Fiends'' at the Taylor studio earlier this month.</p>
        <p>But as Ella Baff, the Pillow's executive director, told the audience at the Ted Shawn Theater here on Tuesday night, the Taylor company's appearances through Sunday afternoon will be seen in a context of special events. One is an exhibition of Mr. Taylor's collages of found objects, insects and butterflies. Not surprisingly, the sharp Taylor touch is visible in the art works. Those who might not like a row of beetles on the table of a bas-relief of ''The Last Supper'' titled ''First Course,'' might accept ''Long Island Expressway Going East'': rows of beetles in the ''lanes'' of worm-eaten wood.</p>
        <p>On the more conventional side, there will be performances of choreography by former Taylor dancers and talks by them. Taylor 2, the choreographer's apprentice company, will also perform, but not on the same bill with the senior troupe as it did at the opening. On this occasion, the cake-eating at a reception after the performance was preceded by brief remarks from Neil D. Chrisman, chairman of the Pillow board; Norton Belknap, president of the Taylor company's board; Mr. Taylor; and Irene Mennen Hunter, a benefactor and member of both boards who commissioned ''Fiends Angelical.''</p>
        <p>The opening night was a benefit for both the Pillow and the Taylor company and began with ''Cascade,'' a filigreed and luminous work set to Bach concertos recently seen in New York. ''Profiles,'' a ritualistic quartet of great tension full of acrobatic clambering and archaic profiles (set to Jan Radzynski's ever exciting buzzing score), was fearlessly attacked by the young Taylor 2 dancers. Michelle Fleet was the victim grieved over by Robert Kleinendorst, while Julie Tice and Joseph Gallerizzo were their more heartless counterparts. ''Piazzolla Caldera,'' Mr. Taylor's sizzling gloss on the tango, exhilaratingly danced by the senior troupe, completed the program.</p>
        <p>On the mock macabre side, ''Fiends Angelical'' has a title that suggest a duality not evident onstage. When seen in practice clothes in a studio, the dancers had more individuality, but it is almost impossible to tell the girls from the boys in Mr. Loquasto's costumes. Unisex tights with laced designs and the wigs flash by at high speed. The tribe pushes palms up and pumps down knees as it circles, leaps or drops to the floor.</p>
        <p>When four pairs of dancers set up a square in front of Mr. Loquasto's black and gold backdrop (leafy motifs and a circle around a flower), Francie Huber as the priestess steps into the turbulent fray.</p>
        <p>The infernal round becomes more intense. As Mr. Crumb's music quotes from Schubert's ''Death and the Maiden,'' Lisa Viola and Patrick Corbin, both remarkable in their acute timing and agility, end a grotesque duet. Ms. Huber steps in to weave a spell and the long red gut is pulled from the couple to form a star design. The tribe encircles the couple, and Ms. Huber ends in the center. Forget the symbols and enjoy the dazzling dancers -- who include Kristi Egtvedt, Takehiro Ueyama, Michael Trusnovec, Annmaria Mazzini, Orion Duckstein and Amy Young.</p>
