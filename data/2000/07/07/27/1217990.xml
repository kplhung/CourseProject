        <p>Editorial cites need to update telephone-era wiretapping laws to deal with government and employer monitoring of Internet communications to protect privacy; notes new technology is making it possible for law enforcment agencies to scan, read and record millions of e-mail messages</p>

        <p>Millions of Americans now log on to the Internet as naturally and as frequently as they pick up a phone. Technology has created a revolution in personal communications, but technology is also making it possible for government and even employers to monitor private conversations as never before. Telephone-era laws must be updated to address these new challenges to privacy.</p>
        <p>Last week the White House proposed some limited changes to the federal wiretap and electronic privacy laws that would raise legal standards for government interception of e-mail. Separately, several lawmakers introduced legislation to require employers to notify employees about how e-mail, Internet use and phone calls are monitored. Employees of The New York Times Company are already notified that the company reserves the right to review e-mail messages while investigating a complaint. Last year the company dismissed 23 employees -- most based at a regional business office -- for sending offensive e-mail messages.</p>

Telephone-era laws must be updated to address these new challenges to privacy.</p>
        <p>Last week the White House proposed some limited changes to the federal wiretap and electronic privacy laws that would raise legal standards for government interception of e-mail. Separately, several lawmakers introduced legislation to require employers to notify employees about how e-mail, Internet use and phone calls are monitored. Employees of The New York Times Company are already notified that the company reserves the right to review e-mail messages while investigating a complaint. Last year the company dismissed 23 employees -- most based at a regional business office -- for sending offensive e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>In the absence of more stringent controls, law enforcement agencies may be tempted to conduct wholesale monitoring of digital written communications. It is probably not practical for agents to listen in on all the phone calls, for example, that go through AT&amp;T. But new technology is making it possible for agencies like the F.B.I. to scan, read and record millions of pieces of e-mail on the network of an Internet service provider. Until now, this kind of power and its potential for abuse were not so readily available.</p>
        <p>Current wiretapping laws were not drafted with this technology in mind and need to be updated. Various statutes now set different legal standards for the secret interception of domestic communications by law enforcement agencies, depending on whether the communication is by telephone, e-mail or cable modem.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration is proposing to eliminate these inconsistencies. Its plan would bring the standards used for intercepting e-mail messages up to the stricter, more protective level now applied to telephone wiretaps. Illegal interception of e-mail would result in suppression of the evidence, as is the case now with illegal interception of phone calls. The proposal would also enforce the same legal standards that apply to phone calls for interception of e-mails sent by cable modems, which have a greater degree of privacy protection under a law that governs cable systems.</p>
        <p>The administration is also calling for greater authority for courts to review law enforcement requests to use devices that record the phone numbers of incoming and outgoing calls and to track the origins and destinations of e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>These changes are clearly needed. But Congress also needs to provide new safeguards against the government's wrongful use of ever more powerful surveillance technology against law-abiding citizens. Serious concerns have been raised about Carnivore, the new online wiretap system used by the F.B.I. to track the communications of individuals suspected of criminal activity.</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. says the technology can isolate the e-mail of the target of an investigation. But the system, when hooked up to the network of the Internet service provider, gives the F.B.I. unlimited  access to the e-mail of all other subscribers on the network. While a court order is still required to intercept the content of messages, the secret technology controlled exclusively by law enforcement raises fears of improper monitoring.</p>
        <p>Until now, routine government surveillance of private conversations was limited as much by practicality as by legal constraints. Now that it is feasible to eavesdrop electronically on an unlimited scale, the laws have to be strengthened to prevent monitoring of all online communications simply because technology makes it easy.</p>
