        <p>While the recorded music industry has kicked off a legal war against Web-based music sharing, a study by Jupiter Communications concludes that Napster and similar sites actually spur CD sales.</p>
        <p>Jupiter, an Internet commerce analysis firm, says that online music users are 45 percent more likely than nonusers to have increased their total music purchases over the last six months. ''The way people interact with music is changing but in good ways,'' said Stacey Herron, a music analyst at Jupiter. ''I don't think music sharing technologies are a dead end for the industry. Quite the opposite in fact. An informed consumer is a happy consumer.</p>
        <p>The Recording Industry Association of America and several recording companies and musicians argue that Napster and other Web services that allow people to exchange songs as MP3 files break copyright laws and deny musicians compensation for their work.</p>
        <p>Ms. Herron said a preliminary examination of a survey of 2,200 online music users Jupiter made in June shows that MP3's often inspire listeners to go out and buy CD's.</p>
        <p>Jupiter is also critical of a study by the trade group that shows CD sales in stores near colleges have dropped in areas with high levels of MP3 usage. Ms. Stacey said the study partly covers the time before Napster began operating and does not account for other factors that affect sales.</p>
        <p>Doug Curry, a spokesman for the trade group, which is part of an effort to obtain an injunction against Napster's service, declined to comment on the Jupiter report until his organization receives a copy. However, he said the trade group ''stands by'' its research.</p>
        <p>Even the Jupiter study, however, shows that the positive impact is not universal. Ms. Stacey said it found that most 18- to 24-year-olds who spent less than $20 on recordings over three months have not increased their CD shopping. However, she says that will change. ''A couple of years from now, they are going to be adults and buying a lot of music.''</p>
