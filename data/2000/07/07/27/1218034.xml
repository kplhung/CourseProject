        <p>Editorial urges consideration of launching abroad of North Korean satellites in exchange for North Korea giving up its long-range missile program</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>President Vladimir Putin of Russia came back from North Korea recently reporting a tantalizing offer. The North, he said, would give up its menacing long-range-missile program if other countries would launch at least two North Korean space satellites a year. If, as Mr. Putin believes, Pyongyang envisions sending its satellites abroad for launching, the proposal merits serious consideration. But if North Korea expects other countries to provide it with advanced rockets it could learn to copy, the risks are unacceptable.</p>
        <p>North Korea now appears to be in the early stages of a transformation that Washington should actively encourage. After decades of belligerence and self-imposed isolation, Pyongyang has reached out in recent months with words and gestures of reconciliation, most notably toward its former archenemy, South Korea.</p>

        <p>President Vladimir Putin of Russia came back from North Korea recently reporting a tantalizing offer. The North, he said, would give up its menacing long-range-missile program if other countries would launch at least two North Korean space satellites a year. If, as Mr. Putin believes, Pyongyang envisions sending its satellites abroad for launching, the proposal merits serious consideration. But if North Korea expects other countries to provide it with advanced rockets it could learn to copy, the risks are unacceptable.</p>
        <p>North Korea now appears to be in the early stages of a transformation that Washington should actively encourage. After decades of belligerence and self-imposed isolation, Pyongyang has reached out in recent months with words and gestures of reconciliation, most notably toward its former archenemy, South Korea.</p>
        <p>But it is too soon to conclude that North Korea has joined the community of peaceful nations. Its nuclear weapons and missile programs have been suspended, not abandoned. Reckless foreign missile sales and human rights abuses continue, as do allegations of international drug trafficking. America must use caution in engaging North Korea.</p>
        <p>North Korea's efforts to develop long-range missiles have alarmed Japan and have driven American plans to build a limited national missile defense. Washington's next step should be clarifying what Pyongyang has in mind. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright can begin that exploration when she meets with North Korea's foreign minister in Bangkok tomorrow. Past experience with North Korea suggests that its initial bargaining proposals can be vague and unreliable.</p>
        <p>Besides confirming that North Korea is proposing satellite launches from outside its territory, Washington needs to find out whether the satellites would be used for military and intelligence purposes and who would pay the launching costs. It should also seek a North Korean commitment to stop exporting missile technology.</p>
