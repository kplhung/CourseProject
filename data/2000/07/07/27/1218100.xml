        <p>Correction of July 26 chart: Air France crash was first of Concorde, but not first of supersonic airliner; correction of July 26 article, which misstated last year in which other supersonic airliner flew</p>

        <p>A chart yesterday with articles about the crash of a Concorde jet near Paris referred incorrectly to the precedents. While this was the first crash of a Concorde, it was not the first of a supersonic airliner; a Soviet Tupolev 144 crashed at the Paris Air Show in 1973, and another crashed on a test flight in 1978.</p>
        <p>A related article, about the history of the Concorde, misstated the last year in which the Tupolev 144 flew. After the 1973 crash, the plane was used for mail and cargo service starting in 1975, and briefly for passenger service in 1977 and 1978.</p>
