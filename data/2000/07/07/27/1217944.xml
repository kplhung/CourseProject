        <p>MY friend Laura once pitched an article called ''Guy Bait'' to a major women's magazine, for which she wanted to take nifty gadgets into bars and see how long it took patrons of the male persuasion to sidle over for casual conversation and a little technology cruising. If portable digital video disk players had been on the market then, I suspect that she would have had the men sidling in from 10 blocks away.</p>
        <p>I recently spent time with three new portable DVD players and found that crowds of both men and women would gather around when I had one on parade. Alas, I didn't have the similarly high expectations for the players themselves. I had expected them to have the visual kick of those square seat-back video screens on transatlantic flights that let you squint through your own personal showing of ''Stuart Little'' on an overnight flight to London.</p>

        <p>MY friend Laura once pitched an article called ''Guy Bait'' to a major women's magazine, for which she wanted to take nifty gadgets into bars and see how long it took patrons of the male persuasion to sidle over for casual conversation and a little technology cruising. If portable digital video disk players had been on the market then, I suspect that she would have had the men sidling in from 10 blocks away.</p>
        <p>I recently spent time with three new portable DVD players and found that crowds of both men and women would gather around when I had one on parade. Alas, I didn't have the similarly high expectations for the players themselves. I had expected them to have the visual kick of those square seat-back video screens on transatlantic flights that let you squint through your own personal showing of ''Stuart Little'' on an overnight flight to London.</p>
        <p>After testing several units, though, I must say that I was wrong. Current portable DVD players offer bright, clear video display, Dolby Digital sound and batteries powerful enough for a double feature.</p>
        <p>There are many models and price levels to choose from in the realm of portable DVD players, with the price of the high-end units around $1,500 and lower-end ones about $700. With regular home-based DVD players selling for as little as $200 in some places, the hefty price tag of the portables may place them out of the reach of many consumers. Owners of laptops with built-in or added-on DVD drives may find the traveling DVD players to be something of a moot point; the portable models are aimed more at the dedicated home-theater enthusiast. All the portables I tested could also be fully integrated with home theater equipment (for most people without electrical engineering degrees, it is basically the TV-VCR combo -- and maybe the stereo -- all wired together) or used as a stand-alone player if you were on the go.</p>
        <p>One of the most appealing portable players is Panasonic's new DVD-LV75 from its PalmTheater line. It costs about $1,400, and if you read entertainment magazines, you have probably seen the advertisements for it: a futuristic silver device displaying an action scene from ''The Matrix'' (a film that was seemingly made for DVD). At just over three pounds without the flat lithium-ion battery pack that attaches to the bottom of the unit, the DVD-LV75 feels like it weighs less than the new ''Harry Potter'' book, and it's definitely thinner. With the screen folded, it is less than an inch thick and measures about 5.5 inches by 7 inches.</p>
        <p>The DVD-LV75 has a seven-inch screen, which is one of the bigger video displays available on a portable unit. The flat L.C.D. screen was sharper than I expected and was bright enough for me to watch movies comfortably in a variety of lighting conditions. After charging the battery, which the company says has a four-hour life span, I made it all the way through ''Chinatown'' without any lag in the unit's performance. Like all the portables I looked at, the player comes with an AC adapter to charge the battery as well as run the player without the battery pack attached.</p>
        <p>Once I adjusted to the screen's small size, I forgot about the fact that I was watching the movie on such a tiny machine and became absorbed in the film itself. I did notice that the battery pack began to get warmer and warmer as the movie progressed, and by the time Faye Dunaway said: ''She's my sister! She's my daughter!'' the whole player itself felt rather toasty. The heat wasn't searing, by any means, but it was noticeable and enough to keep the player from being considered a laptop model.</p>
        <p>The external speaker on the DVD-LV75 was adequate for the casual viewer, but attaching a pair of decent-quality headphones was an immense improvement. In addition to standard audio and video jacks, the player has a port for an optical digital audio cable and an S-Video output jack for high-quality display when it is connected to a full-size television.</p>
        <p>Sony Electronics recently released a portable DVD player with similar features. The Sony DVP-FX1 offers the seven-inch L.C.D. screen in the cinematic, wide-screen 16:9 (width-to-height ratio) format (as opposed to the squarish 4:3 format used by most standard television screens). The company says that its lithium-ion battery will last up to four hours.</p>
        <p>Sony's model is roughly the same size as Panasonic's version. It offers Dolby Digital sound and many of the same standard DVD features like smooth motion scan, which lets users easily stop on a specific frame of the film. The screen was also clear and bright and nicely displayed the deep, saturated colors of the ''Wallace &amp; Gromit'' disk.</p>
        <p>The playback was smooth, even when I wiggled the unit to simulate what a small child might do in the back seat of the family minivan on a summer drive across America. Portable entertainment for cars, boats and vans is one of the uses Sony suggests as a reason for plunking down the considerable cash for one of these machines. Sony's DVP-FX1 is priced at about $1,600, but depending on how badly your children behave on long trips, it could be a bargain.</p>
        <p>To help prevent the youngsters from running off and watching movies that Mom or Dad may not approve of, Sony is incorporating the Custom Parental Control System into some of its portable DVD models. The system allows parents to control access to as many as 50 titles.</p>
        <p>If I had to choose between the Panasonic and Sony models, I would give a small edge to the Panasonic, mainly because of the slight price difference. Both are fine machines.</p>
        <p>There are less expensive options in the portable player market. The screens on the cheaper models are generally smaller and the overall design of the units is not as sleek and compact as those of more expensive models. But for someone who doesn't mind having a smaller screen and a bigger case in exchange for saving several hundred dollars, a bulkier portable may make more sense.</p>
        <p>Aiwa's XD-DW1 player falls into that category. The company's suggested price is $850, but the player can be found in stores for $650 to $700. The screen measures 5.8 inches diagonally, and the design is a bit clunkier than that of the more expensive competitors. The active-matrix screen loses some clarity when viewed from odd angles but looks fine head-on.</p>
        <p>The XD-DW1 has built-in stereo speakers and will play audio CD's as well as DVD movies. It offers Dolby Digital sound and S-Video output and comes with the cables you need to connect it to your home entertainment equipment. For the price, the Aiwa XD-DW1 was pretty solid, and  not having the extra inch or so of viewable screen area that the other two players provided didn't particularly bother me when I was engrossed in ''The Seven Samurai.''</p>
        <p>People will have to decide whether the cost of a portable DVD player is justified, and I can't honestly say I would buy one myself if cost weren't a consideration, especially with home players being so inexpensive. But I can see the appeal of a portable for those who travel a lot, are serious cinemaholics or who want to use a single DVD player in a variety of locales.</p>
        <p>Besides, if I wait long enough, the prices might come down even more. Remember how much an early Walkman cost?</p>
