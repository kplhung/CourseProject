        <p>Discussions to win the cooperation of Sotheby's former president and chief executive, Diana D. Brooks, in the federal antitrust investigation of Sotheby's and Christie's have intensified, lawyers and others close to the case said this week.</p>
        <p>The talks, they said, are aimed at getting Ms. Brooks to testify that she colluded in anticompetitive deals with her counterpart at Christie's at the direction of the former chairman at Sotheby's, A. Alfred Taubman. Mr. Taubman, a shopping center magnate who purchased the controlling interest in Sotheby's in 1983, resigned in February, along with Ms. Brooks. He has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department's three-year-old inquiry centers on accusations that the world's most powerful auction houses conspired as far back as 1991 to fix the fees they charge buyers and sellers.</p>
        <p>Documents from Christopher M. Davidge, who abruptly resigned as Christie's chief executive on Dec. 24, support accusations of collusion between the two auction giants, Christie's has said in court filings. Lawyers for Christie's turned the documents over to the government as part of a conditional amnesty agreement in December and last week they were distributed to a select group of lawyers under court confidentiality orders.</p>
        <p>People who have seen the approximately 150 pages of documents said they contained notes from Mr. Davidge to Sir Anthony Tennant, Christie's chairman, about discussions with Ms. Brooks along with memos from Sir Anthony to Mr. Davidge  about talks with Mr. Taubman. Both Mr. Davidge and Ms. Brooks say they were acting on orders from their chairmen.</p>
        <p>Sir Anthony, who lives in London, also denies any wrongdoing and has not cooperated in the investigation, people close to the inquiry say. Sir Anthony and his lawyer, Richard Taylor, reached by telephone, refused to comment.</p>
        <p>Issues discussed in the documents, people who have seen them say, center around the fees charged to buyers and sellers.  They also include notes about talks concerning interest rates that both Sotheby's and Christie's charge sellers who receive financing in the form of loans that are to be paid back to the auction house.</p>
        <p>A person close to the Justice Department investigation said that prosecutors interviewed Mr. Davidge about those interest rate discussions,</p>
        <p>If the case should result in indictments and come to trial, the documents could well be offered as evidence under rules allowing the introduction of records maintained in the normal course of business, some lawyers said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidge would presumably be a central witness under his and Christie's amnesty agreements with the government. In addition, people close to the investigation have said, the government is seeking the cooperation of Ms. Brooks who, they say, has signaled through one of her lawyers, Stephen E. Kaufman, that she might be amenable to testifying for the prosecution in return for leniency.</p>
        <p>The talks, often stalled, have gone on for months, with prosecutors taking a hard line on Ms. Brooks's possible exposure to prison and Mr. Kaufman seeking guarantees that would spare her incarceration. Several people close to the investigation said that discussions had clearly intensified in recent weeks but that an agreement was not yet in sight. Mr. Kaufman denied that any deal had been struck and declined  to comment further. John J. Greene, who is leading the antitrust investigation in New York, did not return a call left with his office.</p>
        <p>People close to the investigation said that prosecutors were evidently trying to secure Ms. Brooks's testimony against Mr. Taubman. Whether Mr. Taubman's lawyers have been approached for his possible cooperation is not clear but he has consistently taken the position that he knew of no wrongdoing and has nothing to contribute. His lawyer, Scott W. Muller, was out of town and unreachable, his office said.</p>
