        <p>After two weeks of deal-making that ended without a deal, President Clinton said today that the key to a Middle East peace agreement was more time for internal debate and reflection by the Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
        <p>The White House said the American envoy for the region, Dennis B. Ross, would travel there in the coming weeks to gauge any post-summit-meeting progress, but officials ruled out follow-up negotiations in the United States any time soon.</p>
        <p>''If there is going to be an agreement here, it must be one which meets the legitimate interests of both parties,'' Mr. Clinton told reporters at the White House. ''And that requires a certain imagination and flexibility of defining those interests and figuring out an institutional and legal framework for them that, frankly, just takes more time and more reflection and probably less pressure than was available in our 15 days at Camp David.''</p>
        <p>Noting the historic nature of the talks, he added, ''You've got to get used to talking about something for a little bit before you can then entertain how you can create an edifice that you hadn't previously imagined.''</p>
        <p>White House officials today refused to disclose details of the closed-door negotiations. They said they believed that they would have to build on the progress of the Camp David talks in the coming months, and did not want to hamper future deals by disclosing the negotiating positions.</p>
        <p>White House officials did describe Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel as being far more willing to deal than Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.</p>
        <p>''The Palestinians, with respect particularly to the issue of Jerusalem, were not as prepared to compromise,'' Samuel R. Berger, the president's national security adviser, said in an interview on CNN.</p>
        <p>The end of the talks enabled Mr. Clinton to turn his sights back to his domestic agenda today. He staged events celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act and criticizing Republican tax cut plans.</p>
