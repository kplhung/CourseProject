        <p>At the inconclusive conclusion of the Camp David summit meeting on Tuesday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel may not have won a peace agreement, but he did win the presidential award for best camper. President Clinton concluded by asserting that Mr. Barak was more creative, flexible and determined to reach a peace agreement.</p>
        <p>As a result, in the event that Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, is compelled to fulfill his pledge to declare a state in September, he may find himself with less international sympathy and financial aid than he might have hoped for.</p>
        <p>If that creates new pressure on Mr. Arafat, then this would be a canny achievement for Mr. Barak, who pushed for the meeting, which Mr. Arafat considered premature.</p>
        <p>For years, Mr. Arafat has been the peripatetic Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, traveling from capital to capital in pursuit of legitimacy and backing. During the rightist Israeli administration of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he found success, especially in nurturing a relationship with Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>During those three years, Israel developed the taint of a somewhat outlaw state for not climbing aboard the peace platform, or at least not with proper enthusiasm and good intentions. While Palestinians perceived that the Americans were always on Israel's side first, Mr. Arafat made considerable headway in tugging the gorilla superpower closer to his viewpoint.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Barak took office a year ago, he immediately took to the skies himself, assiduously working to tilt world opinion back toward Israel. He courted the English, the Germans, the French, but especially the Americans. It was last July that he spent his first late night chatting at Camp David with Mr. Clinton, scouting out the retreat to which he fully intended to return as a peacemaker.</p>
        <p>And this week, his advisers say, he believes that he capped his mission to make Israel seem the more reasonable party in the peace effort, perhaps even bolstering Israel's strategic ties with the United States.</p>
        <p>The summit meeting consciously mimicked the Israeli-Egyptian one that took place 22 years ago at Camp David. Then, the Israelis and the Egyptians defied all expectations by emerging with the first Israeli-Arab peace agreement. With that perspective, some thought that the unthinkable could happen this time, too, that the Israelis and the Palestinians could really sort it all out.</p>
        <p>But everything in this seven-year incremental process has taken time, inching forward and slipping back. And maybe, in the best of lights, however long it takes to get back to the negotiating table, Camp David will have served well the cause of peace. Maybe both sides needed to walk away empty-handed in order to set the stage for the future.</p>
        <p>During this Camp David meeting, for the first time, ordinary Israelis and Palestinians focused on what might be the price of peace.</p>
        <p>In Israel, the previously taboo idea of reconstituting -- that is, dividing -- Jerusalem got a full airing. Mr. Barak, who is the most decorated soldier in Israeli history, gave his ''Mr. Security'' persona a full workout. In the name of making peace to ensure Israel's security, he entertained a sizable transfer of West Bank territory -- from 88 to 95 percent -- the evacuation of settlements, a land swap, a small resettlement plan for Palestinian refugees and the ceding of some Jerusalem neighborhoods to the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>This was a rapid-fire, neck-swiveling adjustment in the Israeli boundaries of acceptable compromise. It was not enough for the Palestinians, but it probably went to the absolute limits of what Israeli public opinion could stomach. And judging by the polls during the summit meeting, they were stomaching it, and maybe months down the road their capacity for absorbing compromises could expand further.</p>
        <p>Because of what Mr. Barak was willing to do, Mr. Arafat probably lost ground in the eyes of the Americans and his relative standing in the eyes of the European nations that have been bankrolling the development of a Palestinian infrastructure.</p>
        <p>But with his domestic support at a low, Mr. Arafat needed a big win at home and in the Arab world, and he secured one. ''Arafat was depicted perhaps as the bad boy of the talks, but his people will increase their backing for him,'' Zohir Andreas, editor of an Israeli Arabic weekly, wrote today. ''Arafat was not ready for there to be a Palestinian uprising against himself.''</p>
        <p>Having never prepared public opinion for any concessions on refugee rights or East Jerusalem, Mr. Arafat would not have been on solid ground in making sudden shifts. It would have been a real shock for the Palestinians if, after all his unyielding statements, he succumbed in one sitting to American and Israeli pressure to abandon his demands for the refugees' right of return and to accept less than full sovereignty over East Jerusalem. As far as most Palestinians are concerned, having conceded the land that is now Israel, they have no wiggle room left. East Jerusalem is part of their national soul, and the refugees are family.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Arafat has the time to try to alter this perception. It is believed that despite what he tells his people, he may be willing to make some concessions on the refugee issue, provided that international compensation and resettlement relieve him of the burden of absorbing most of the refugees into the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Would he be willing to acknowledge this, if it is true?</p>
        <p>It is very difficult to imagine Mr. Arafat as accepting limited sovereignty in East Jerusalem, even as better than nothing. But perhaps he could change his mind to consider deferring resolution of the contested city's status, and find a way to secure Arab backing for that decision.</p>
        <p>This is the way to interpret hopefully the failure at Camp David. It assumes that talks will eventually resume. But the Israeli prime minister is politically weak, the American president is retiring, and the Palestinian leader is not getting any younger.</p>
        <p>The failure not only heartens the anti-peace camps in both Israeli and the Palestinian world, but raises a question that even doves will ask themselves: Is the peace process all process? Is peace itself attainable or just a goal post at the end of a path that will keep getting longer?</p>
