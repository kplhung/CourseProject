        <p>Joe Montana steps into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday in Canton, Ohio. It never bothered Montana that some people might frown over his selection of Eddie DeBartolo as his presenter.</p>

        <p>Joe Montana steps into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday in Canton, Ohio. It never bothered Montana that some people might frown over his selection of Eddie DeBartolo as his presenter.</p>
        <p>DeBartolo, former owner of the San Francisco 49ers, is out of pro football. He was banned for the 1999 season after pleading guilty to failing to report a felony in a gambling extortion case involving the former Louisiana governor Edwin W. Edwards.</p>
        <p>Then DeBartolo lost the team for good to his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, after nasty court fights.</p>
        <p>During DeBartolo's reign, his 49ers won five Super Bowls and brought first-class style and charisma to the National Football League. For the N.F.L.'s juggernaut image, this was good. The gambling stuff, the public sibling squabbles? To the N.F.L. hierarchy, this was bad. Very bad. Embarrassing, even.</p>
        <p>DeBartolo had become a symbol among the N.F.L.'s power structure of how high and how low someone can go in their game. In the N.F.L., he was a reminder that not only players became engulfed in off-field problems. He had, though, begun to steadily fade from the N.F.L. landscape.</p>
        <p>And now, front and center, on the steps of the hallowed Hall, DeBartolo is forced down the their throats. Down America's. All in one of the league's most cherished annual events.</p>
        <p>Montana, however, said DeBartolo was a clear choice. He initially considered asking his father or his former 49ers coach, Bill Walsh. But, Montana later decided it had to be DeBartolo.</p>
        <p>''I asked him and I wanted to make sure he was comfortable with it,'' Montana said. ''He said he was and that was all I needed. Honestly, I haven't had one real complaint about it yet. Usually you hear something like that down the ladder, but I haven't. Mr. D. not only affected my life but all of his players. If there was ever a need, he had an answer. He had heart. He had fire, temper and a desire to win.</p>
        <p>''I remember one of the first hotels I stayed in as a 49er was on the road at Tampa and, I tell you, a cockroach carried my luggage into the room. He realized we needed better accommodations, bigger planes, a classier style. We got it. When babies were born in our families and on birthdays, he sent hand-written cards.</p>
        <p>''He has not changed through the ups and downs. He has been there for me, and I have been there to support him. We sometimes talk once or twice a week or we may play phone tag for a month. He is my friend. And, let's face it: a lot of people that stand up there in Canton haven't accomplished half the things he has and some of them have had much bigger troubles.''</p>
        <p>Montana spoke without losing his cool. You see, he describes himself as a ''Do Person.'' Make decisions, loyal and honest ones, and press forward.</p>
        <p>Just the way he played quarterback.</p>
        <p>He is part of the Class of 2000 that includes Howie Long, Ronnie Lott, Dave Wilcox and Dan Rooney.</p>
        <p>Montana was in Manhattan yesterday at the Waldorf-Astoria talking about himself, football, his induction and about heart disease. He has decided to lend his name to a new cause, the N.F.L. Cholesterol Screen Team, along with Bill Parcells. Both helped kick off a program that encourages N.F.L. fans to get their cholesterol tested.</p>
        <p>''I had a grandfather die of heart disease at age 54,'' said Montana, who turned 44 last month. ''My mom has high blood pressure. My cholesterol has always been under 200 but right now it's at 215. I know have to watch it because heart disease runs in my family.''</p>
        <p>It has been nearly six years since he played quarterback in the N.F.L., yet Montana remains one of the game's top 10 players in popularity. He is an icon in the Bay Area but, obviously, his popularity far exceeds that base.</p>
        <p>''Some people meet me and don't know I'm not playing anymore,'' Montana said. ''I think the Hall of Fame stuff has something to do with it because it's kept the idea alive a little bit. Five years away from football for me seems like forever, but for some it is a passing moment.''</p>
        <p>Part of that is because for 15 seasons -- 13 in San Francisco and 2 in Kansas City -- Montana produced magic. He was good in big games and even better in bigger games. It is the postseason accomplishments that separate him from Fran Tarkenton, Dan Marino, Warren Moon and even John Elway and other splendid quarterbacks before, during and since Montana's playing time. He owns the career playoff record for passing attempts, completions, touchdowns and yards. He tossed six 300-yard passing games in the postseason. He won four Super Bowls and is the only player to win three Super Bowl M.V.P. awards. And check out these Super Bowl numbers: no interceptions in 122 passes, 11 touchdowns and a 68 percent pass completion rate.</p>
        <p>He is the greatest quarterback ever.</p>
        <p>But one of his most remarkable accomplishments was the way he blended with his teammates. When it comes to notoriety, the N.F.L. is very much a me-first business among players. Most players relish attention. But throughout his career, Montana absorbed the spotlight but was able to make his teammates feel comfortable. No small feat.</p>
        <p>''Some people try to elevate themselves and say 'I'm the Guy,' but that was not what I was about,'' Montana said. ''You gain respect by just being who you are.</p>
        <p>''The game for me might have looked easy, but it wasn't. It was fun. I played football for 31 years and then I just quit. It is almost impossible to get it out of your system. My girls are 14 and 13 and the boys are 10 and 8. They've begun to watch the replays of my games.''</p>
        <p>They can see that for their father, under center and in the pocket was ''one of the greatest places to be.''</p>
        <p>Montana is involved in a new sports magazine and in a venture-capital investment firm with Lott and Harris Barton, a former teammate. He plans to do business soon with DeBartolo. He golfs. He and his family enjoy their 32 horses on his 600-acre ranch near San Francisco. He still finds ways to compete.</p>
        <p>It is his nature, the trait, along with poise, talent and instincts, that helped him rise from being a third-round pick in the 1979 draft, the 82nd player selected, all of the way to the Hall of Fame as the best quarterback ever.</p>
        <p>He now likes watching Troy Aikman, Peyton Manning and Kurt Warner play quarterback. Warner, he said, ''has amazing feel downfield.'' It takes a guy who had it to recognize it.</p>
        <p>He follows the 49ers and the Chiefs. And ''my Steelers,'' the team he grew up watching in Monongahela, Pa.</p>
        <p>''I get criticism for rarely going to my hometown,'' Montana said. ''I've been back to Notre Dame twice since I left. I haven't set foot in the 49ers facility but once since I left. I love every place, but I don't live too much in the past. I'm a do person. I'm not a good spectator.''</p>
        <p>On Saturday in Canton, though, with DeBartolo once again by his side, Montana will do both.</p>
