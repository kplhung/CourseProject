        <p>ABC News is revamping the executive structure of its newsmagazine division amid a general decline in ratings for the magazine-style programs at all of the major broadcast networks.</p>
        <p>This fall, ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Company, will put new executive producers in charge of ''20/20 Downtown,'' ''Prime Time Live Thursday'' and the Friday edition of ''20/20.''</p>
        <p>For the last two years, all of ABC's prime-time newsmagazines have been controlled by Victor Neufeld. He is being named senior executive producer of ABC News prime-time magazines and will have general oversight of the programs.</p>
        <p>The new executive producers will report to him but will have individual control of their programs.</p>
        <p>Executives said that David Sloan, the senior producer of ''20/20 Downtown,'' would become the executive producer of ''20/20 Friday.'' ''Downtown'' is the only ABC news program that has had a significant rise in ratings this season. Executive producers are still being sought for the other two programs.</p>
        <p>Executives said the change was intended to make the programs more distinctive and less reliant on formulaic stories and sensationalism.</p>
        <p>Though some inside ABC said Mr. Neufeld's role would be somewhat diminished, he said he supported the changes.</p>
        <p>''The way to go is not to make generic newsmagazines, but to create distinctive programs,'' he said.</p>
