        <p>After two months of maneuvering, President Vladimir V. Putin and 89 of Russia's most powerful leaders -- the nation's czar-like regional governors -- faced off today in a long-anticipated political showdown.</p>
        <p>It was not even a contest.</p>
        <p>In a matter of hours, the governors accepted almost without protest Mr. Putin's proposal to overhaul the federal tax code, a plan that promises to break their control over billions of rubles in tax receipts.</p>
        <p>They also voted -- as Mr. Putin had also demanded -- to abolish their own seats in the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian Parliament.</p>
        <p>Under the legislation approved today, the governors and 89 members of provincial legislatures whom they  had handpicked will leave by January 2002, giving way to a full-time, and somewhat more independent, group of legislators.</p>
        <p>Today's entire proceeding belied the predictions of politicians and pundits alike that the governors, who have run their provinces like fiefs since the days of President Boris N. Yeltsin, would fight to the end Mr. Putin's plan to curb their powers.</p>
        <p>Since his inauguration in May, Mr. Putin has moved to reassert Moscow's historic grip on the willful regions, arguing that the Kremlin is now too weak to govern and that the governors -- some of whom have ignored the Constitution and even pondered secession -- must be subservient to it.</p>
        <p>Over the concerns of some analysts that the Kremlin is effectively rebuilding the all-powerful state of Soviet days, Mr. Putin now seems to have accomplished much of his goal.</p>
        <p>The council voted 119 to 18 to end the automatic right of governors and their legislative appointees to sit in the Parliament.</p>
        <p>''The will of the emperor, or that of the president, is tantamount to law,'' the council member and governor of Chuvash, Nikolai Fyodorov, said during the debate today.</p>
        <p>In truth, the council may have had little choice. The lower house of Parliament, the Duma, which has always bristled at the governors' claim of superiority, had already agreed by a virtually veto-proof margin to Mr. Putin's proposal.</p>
        <p>The council members agreed to their own ouster after persuading the lower house and the Kremlin to accept a compromise that holds out the prospect of a new constitutional convention to set a final form for the Russian government.</p>
        <p>The compromise also allowed members to remain in the council until their terms expire, and gave the governors the right to appoint and remove their successors. Council members from the provincial legislatures, who had been named in the past by the governors, will now be elected by their peers.</p>
        <p>The lower house had already overridden the governors' veto of an earlier law that gives Mr. Putin the right to fire governors and dissolve provincial legislatures should they act in violation of the federal Constitution.</p>
        <p>The Kremlin's victory in the battle over tax laws was every bit as complete, and potentially as significant.</p>
        <p>The Federation Council voted in unexpectedly lopsided fashion, 115 to 23, to adopt a package of changes that will cut the income tax to a flat 13 percent from a top rate of 35 percent, slash a much-derided tax on the cash flow of businesses, and marginally cut payroll taxes for pensions and other social programs.</p>
        <p>More important, the bill abolishes a warren of special funds that had been created for various taxes, giving the federal tax service the power to collect and administer their receipts. The move is expected to reduce corruption and favoritism in government offices where officials had used the money more or less as personal kitties.</p>
        <p>The cash-flow tax, a 4 percent levy on the revenues of profitable and unprofitable businesses alike, will be cut to 1 percent. The Kremlin had sought to abolish the tax, but settled for the reduction to appease the governors, for whom it has been a major source of revenue.</p>
        <p>Many outsiders thought the Federation Council would veto at least some of the tax changes to protect their own sources of revenue, especially because some of the more contentious provisions had barely squeaked through the lower house earlier. Some said the council would approve the law but block a second technical measure that actually implemented it.</p>
        <p>But in the end, a furious lobbying effort by the Kremlin -- and a threat to put the law into effect by executive order, whether the council approved the technical measure or not -- appeared to win over the legislators.</p>
        <p>The changes are expected to reduce corporate taxes by about 20 percent over all. Mr. Putin's prime minister and former finance minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, had told the legislators that passing the tax code was crucial if the economy, which lately has been growing at a 5 percent annual clip, was to avoid a slowdown and a potential recession.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kasyanov said the economy had all but exhausted the benefit it got in 1998 when the ruble was sharply devalued, making Russian exports a bargain for foreign buyers and igniting a small manufacturing boom. Further growth, he said, would have to be fueled internally by lowering onerous taxes and removing government obstacles to a free market.</p>
        <p>The stiffest objections of the day came from Yuri M. Luzhkov, a Parliament member and the mayor of Moscow, who said the changes would effectively leave regions like his beholden to the Kremlin for handouts.</p>
        <p>''Everyone will be confined to a stall,'' he said, ''with the government offering handfuls of hay.''</p>
