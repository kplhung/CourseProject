        <p>To chew over The New York Times's fiction best-seller list is to be reminded that an author doesn't necessarily need media anointment or a splendid critical sendoff or an otherwise powerful launching to be a striking commercial success. Often all it takes is the gradual accumulation of popularity, the gathering together of heaps of devotees for the writer's books, one after another, until there is a critical mass of ardent fans.</p>
        <p>This is about commercial, not literary, fiction, and the writers are not literary celebrities or sensations; rather, they are first-class practitioners of the art of telling good yarns, mostly about relationships. There will be three such books on the Aug. 6 best-seller list by authors whose careers have been built not only on their storytelling, but also largely by careful, nurturing publishing and word-of-mouth enthusiasm.</p>

        <p>To chew over The New York Times's fiction best-seller list is to be reminded that an author doesn't necessarily need media anointment or a splendid critical sendoff or an otherwise powerful launching to be a striking commercial success. Often all it takes is the gradual accumulation of popularity, the gathering together of heaps of devotees for the writer's books, one after another, until there is a critical mass of ardent fans.</p>
        <p>This is about commercial, not literary, fiction, and the writers are not literary celebrities or sensations; rather, they are first-class practitioners of the art of telling good yarns, mostly about relationships. There will be three such books on the Aug. 6 best-seller list by authors whose careers have been built not only on their storytelling, but also largely by careful, nurturing publishing and word-of-mouth enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>The most startling is ''Not a Day Goes By'' (Doubleday) by E. Lynn Harris, which enters at No. 2 on The Times's list and No. 1 on the Barnes &amp; Noble fiction list (and No. 3 on the chain's overall list). But there was also ''Hot Six'' (St. Martin's Press)  by Janet Evanovich, which opened on The Times's list at No. 1 and is now No. 9; and ''Liar's Game'' (Dutton) by Eric Jerome Dickey, which is No. 14. Mr. Harris and Mr. Dickey write about relationships; Ms. Evanovich writes steamy crime thrillers featuring the lusty bounty hunter from Jersey City, Stephanie Plum.</p>
        <p>''Not a Day Goes By,'' Mr. Harris's  sixth novel, had a first printing of 152,000 copies. There are now 212,000 in print. Mr. Harris, 42, is African-American and gay and writes about love and friendship. His characters are generally young, successful, attractive and black and gay or bisexual. This is not his first best-selling novel, but it is his fastest start out of the carton and its success puts him  into a more rarefied category of best-selling authors.</p>
        <p>It isn't just good writing that goes into the creation of a blastoff like Mr. Harris's. His editor, Janet Hill, said, ''We wanted a smaller book at an attractive price to be out in time for July, to be a beach read.'' So the novel is 271 pages, printed in a smaller format than most hardcovers, and has a list price of $19.95. Which means that in the doorways of the chain bookstores it can be purchased for $11.97.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris's first novel, ''Invisible Life,'' was self-published (but later reissued by Doubleday), so the writer is rather sophisticated about self-promotion. At book signings, he said, ''I spend lots of time writing long autographs, and I urge people to tell their friends, and I tell them if they don't like the book bring it back and I'll give them back their money.'' He also buys blank journals and fills them with the names and addresses of the fans he meets on tour and sends them Christmas and Valentine cards and mass e-mails. He has already collected more than 7,000 names in his journals. (His Web site is www.elynnharris.com.) Mr. Harris also does a lot of interviewing on black radio programs and goes to nearly every black-oriented exposition he can.</p>
        <p>Do his numbers reflect a large cross-over of white readers? His publisher, Stephen Rubin, and his agent, John Hawkins, say the answer is yes, but it's inferential. ''A large number of white women come up and tell him how much they enjoy his books,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''Probably because his books are first and foremost very human, the kind of stories people can relate to, whatever their race.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris is not as sure. ''In some cities, like South Beach and Atlanta, I drew a lot of whites,'' he said. ''In Detroit I didn't.'' But Ms. Hill said that he told her that ''if I can get to ladies-who-lunch audiences, I can sell them.'' And Doubleday is going to give him the opportunity to sell his memoir next year and then two more novels.</p>
        <p>Self-help is the key to the other successes. Ms. Evanovich, besides having a state-of-the-art formula for sexy thrillers, also has a state-of-the-art Web site (www.evanovich.com), which has the freshest information available on her books. Generally, she puts the first chapter of her latest book on the Web site as a teaser leading up to the publication date; then a week or two later the second chapter goes on the Web site. After that, it's buy the book!</p>
        <p>Matthew Shear, publisher of the paperback and reference group of St. Martin's Press, said, ''If you know what you are doing in your marketing and with the right timing and with the author pushing and pushing, you can make it happen.'' It also sends out only a small number of galleys of Ms. Evanovich's books for reviewers only, and not the usual thousands of advance reading copies.</p>
        <p>Dutton published ''Sister, Sister,'' the first novel of Mr. Dickey, who is African-American, in October 1996, and it did it in hardcover, although often publishers trying to ignite a novelist's career start with a paperback. His editor, Audrey LaFehr,  said: ''We started him off modestly, with no advertising and a small public relations budget, but in hardcover because we did know that African-Americans buy hardcover. We printed 18,000 copies, rather a large printing for a first novel, but ended up grossing 40,000 copies and netting 80 percent of that.''</p>
        <p>''On the next one we had a first printing of a little more, in the low 20,000's, and we sent him on a small tour,'' she added. ''Now he tours for two months and more. He has a huge word-of-mouth following.'' There are 140,000 copies of ''Liar's Game,'' his fifth book, in print and that number will probably increase. ''Although he still has a readership that is mostly black,'' she added, ''he really understands female characters.''</p>
        <p>''A lot of his audience are women; and I see white women reading his books on the subway all the time, which is unusual to see people reading novels on the subway,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Of course, the patient, step-by-step creation of nonliterary fiction best sellers appears so easy, particularly when reviewed through a publisher's retrospectivescope. Nonetheless, next week we will find out whether another writer whose novels sold exponentially better, from a clutter of paperback originals to hardcover, will jump out of the box to near the top of the lists. On Tuesday Tami Hoag's fifth hardcover thriller, ''Dust to Dust'' (Bantam Books),'' will be in the marketplace.</p>
