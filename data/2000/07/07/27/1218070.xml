        <p>Amazon.com said yesterday that it had lost $317 million in the second quarter of the year, slightly less than analysts had expected, and asserted that it had stanched the heavy drain on its cash reserves that has raised doubts in the minds of many investors.</p>
        <p>The company, the largest online retailer, posted sales of $578 million, up 84 percent from a year earlier. But that was less than analysts had expected and below the company's own internal target of 90 percent growth.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, played down the shortfall, noting that the company's operating profits exceeded its forecasts because of lower costs.</p>
        <p>''In a multibillion-dollar business, growing sales by 84 percent is rapid by any measure,'' Mr. Bezos said.</p>
        <p>He added that the company had shifted its primary objective from expanding sales to cutting costs.</p>
        <p>''We have two big buckets where we can invest: growth and productivity,'' Mr. Bezos said. ''We instituted a strategy a year ago to deploy more resources to improving operating efficiency.''</p>
        <p>The company has many efforts under way, including reducing excess inventory and putting multiple-item orders into a single box, rather than shipping them from separate warehouses.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Amazon made a 10 percent profit on its shipping and handling charges in the most recent quarter. In the first quarter, its shipping costs exceeded shipping revenue by 5 percent.</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Bezos said that Amazon would not completely halt its rapid expansion. He told investors in a conference call that it planned to expand its international operations into a number of additional countries over the next year and a half. Currently it has operations in Germany and Britain.</p>
        <p>Rather than the $317 million loss determined by generally accepted accounting principles, Amazon wants analysts to use its own formula, which calculates the loss at only $116 million. This figure excludes $110 million from its share of the losses in the other Internet companies in which it owns major stakes, like Drugstore.Com. It also excludes $80 million in charges related to acquisitions and $8 million in employee stock options.</p>
        <p>Excluding those items, Amazon's loss comes to 33 cents a share. Analysts had been expecting an operating loss of 35 cents a share.</p>
        <p>Amazon took pains to counter the views of some analysts who have said that if it continues to lose money at its current rate, it could run out of cash as soon as the end of this year. The company's cash did decline to $908 million at the end of the quarter, from $1 billion at the end of the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Warren C. Jenson, Amazon's chief financial officer, said that by the end of the year, the company should be back to $1 billion in cash. But, he acknowledged, that is largely because Amazon, like all retailers, benefits from the cash from Christmas sales, but does not have to pay its vendors for two months. Accordingly, its cash balance will dip in the first quarter of next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jensen declined to predict whether the company would add or lose cash next year, or for that matter whether it would have a profit or a loss. He did say, however, that he expected the company's losses as a percent of sales to decline steadily.</p>
        <p>The company boasted that its loss, using its preferred formula, was 15 percent of sales in the recent quarter down from 21 percent of sales a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Holly Becker, an analyst with Lehman brothers, praised the company for the increased efficency, but said investors would penalize it for the revenue shortfall.</p>
        <p>''Investors love predictable sales,'' Ms. Becker said. ''The fact the revenues are hard to predict may have a long-term effect on their valuation.'' Ms. Becker downgraded Amazon's shares yesterday before the earnings were released.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Amazon shares fell by $1.56 to $36.06, on word of Ms. Becker's downgrade and perhaps in continued reaction to the resignation of Amazon's president Joseph Galli, who said Tuesday that he would become chief executive of VerticalNet.</p>
        <p>Amazon has grown so quickly, but its ambitions are so vast, that it engenders strong opinions among investors both positive and negative, although the later have predominated lately, with its stock off 53 percent for the year.</p>
        <p>Amazon has become a huge business, with a total of 22.5 million customers, up 2.5 million in the last quarter. Indeed the company estimates it has done business with 8 percent of households in the United States. And its first business, books, has become a major force in the publishing industry. In July, it sold 410,000 copies of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' accounting for nearly 10 percent of the print run for the book.</p>
        <p>The big debate among investors has been the wisdom of Amazon's expansion strategy, now that it has moved to offer a broad range of items.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in the most recent quarter, Amazon's combined book, music and video business in the United states made a $10 million profit based on sales of $385 million. A year earlier that business lost $11 million on sales of $280 million.</p>
        <p>The German and British units, lost $35 million on sales of $73 million. A year ago they lost $16 million on sales of $31 million.</p>
        <p>And the new businesses together lost $65 million on sales of $119 million. A year ago, the company was just entering the toy and electronics businesses, which lost $40 million on sales of $3 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bezos said he was heartened that these new product lines posted sales at an annual rate of $500 million a year, and he noted that sales of consumer electronics were growing particularly briskly.</p>
        <p>''The question was could we move beyond media products,'' Mr. Bezos said. ''Now the question is how much of the $5 trillion retail market can we address.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Becker said she was not impressed.</p>
        <p>''They should expand into other categories, but it may take more time and will be more expected than I had hoped,'' she said.</p>
