        <p>Manhattan prosecutors said yesterday that they were virtually certain that the police had arrested the wrong man in the attack on a young woman with a chunk of concrete in Midtown, despite his confession and two eyewitness identifications.</p>
        <p>And by the end of the day, the police reluctantly agreed that their case was unraveling.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, a Manhattan judge ordered the release of the man, Bently Louis Grant, 35, from the Rikers Island Detention Complex at the request of prosecutors, who said new evidence seemed to clear him. Yesterday, they said security videotapes showed Mr. Grant inside the Virgin Megastore in Union Square at the time of the assault on July 9.</p>
        <p>Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, called the evidence overwhelming. ''We definitely do not think Grant was the perpetrator,'' he said. ''Do you think we would make that decision on something other than the evidence?''</p>
        <p>Prosecutors had looked for Mr. Grant on the videotapes after learning that he had claimed to be in the store on the day of the attack. With detectives, they reviewed 15 hours of tapes from 31 surveillance cameras inside the store, Mr. Morgenthau said. The attack probably took place  between 12:05 and 12:08 p.m., he said, and the tapes clearly show that Mr. Grant was in the store at Broadway and 14th Street from 11:41 a.m. to 12:22 p.m.</p>
        <p>''He carried this milk crate wherever he went, so it's not hard to find him,'' Mr. Morgenthau added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grant, who carried all of his belongings in the crate, has been homeless since last November, said friends, who described him as a quiet and sweet-tempered man. He was arrested last week after a 10-day investigation, and charged with the attempted murder of Tiffany F. Goldberg, 25, the woman who was attacked.</p>
        <p>At 2:40 yesterday morning, he was released on the judge's order from the Rikers Island jail and sent to Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens for psychiatric evaluation.</p>
        <p>But for much of yesterday, Police Department officials insisted that their investigation continued to focus on Mr. Grant. Detectives, who interviewed no new suspects, spent much of the day trying to determine the value of the tapes, officials said.</p>
        <p>The apparent disagreement was noted by Mr. Grant's lawyer, Natasha Lapiner-Giresi. ''I think the Police Department might be in a little bit of a conflict with the district attorney's office,'' she said. ''I can understand that the police would say that he continues as a principal suspect, because they don't have any other suspects.''</p>
        <p>Early in the day, Deputy Chief Thomas Fahey, a department spokesman, said: ''We have not eliminated Grant, that's for sure. His charges have not been dismissed.''</p>
        <p>But by nightfall, it was clear the police were beginning to agree with prosecutors. ''There is evidence that has caused concern, and we are continuing the investigation,'' Chief Fahey said. ''We certainly do not want to convict the wrong person.''</p>
        <p>Despite his release, Mr. Grant had little opportunity to relish his freedom. While at Elmhurst yesterday, family members, including a younger brother, civilly committed him for psychiatric evaluation and treatment, and he will remain there for the foreseeable future, Ms. Lapiner-Giresi said. He has the legal right to contest his commitment, she added.</p>
        <p>Through his lawyer, the family issued a statement saying that the decision to commit Mr. Grant was a painful one. ''You tell them we did it because we love him,'' the statement  said. ''We want him to get help.''</p>
