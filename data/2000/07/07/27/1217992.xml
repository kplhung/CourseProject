        <p>Councilwoman Karen Koslowitz, the Queens Democrat, was not happy about last month's electricity bill for her apartment. The cost, she said, jumped to $78 in June -- even though she spent an entire week out of town with the air-conditioning off -- compared with $35 for the previous month.</p>
        <p>''All this deregulation was supposed to save money,'' said Ms. Koslowitz, who heads the Council's Consumer Affairs Committee. ''It is now costing more money. I just feel that the consumer is getting shortchanged.''</p>
        <p>In the month since the State Public Service Commission lifted price caps from part of what Consolidated Edison could charge to generate electricity, officials say, power bills have gone up significantly for most New York City residents. The average customer, according to Con Edison, will pay 30 percent more than last summer for electricity this June and July. Ms. Koslowitz said her office had received hundreds of complaints from electricity customers.</p>
        <p>Electricity providers were forced before deregulation to set a fixed rate per kilowatt hour of service, meaning that customers' bills would fluctuate month to month only from the amount of electricity they used.  But now, electricity providers can change the monthly rate based on demand, allowing them to raise the price per kilowatt hour.</p>
        <p>Under New York State's version of deregulation, utilities that used to be monopolies are being forced to set aside a certain amount of electricity for outside companies to sell to customers. Con Ed was forced to sell most of its generation plants. The company has begun to focus on distribution of electricity through its grid, instead of generating power.</p>
        <p>Con Ed was also forced to allow other energy companies to use its network to enter the transmission and distribution business. The companies are, in theory, able to shop around for the best power-generation prices to provide lower costs.</p>
        <p>In return, the state lifted caps on how much could be charged for electricity, allowing the market to control prices and creating the spike in prices charged in June. It is likely to be higher throughout the year until there is real competition in the market, said Tom Bourgeois, the senior economist at the Energy Project at Pace University's law school.</p>
        <p>''You have all these issues that sort of cloud the ideological competitive market,'' Mr. Bourgeois said. ''So now, when you have high demand, not enough supply and you've deregulated the price, there will be higher costs for consumers.''</p>
        <p>The Consolidated Edison price increases come as the latest blow to customers who are already grappling with the rising costs of gasoline and home heating oil, Ms. Koslowitz said. Faced with complaints that are growing in pace and pitch almost daily, there is a move by some city politicians to offset the higher electricity rates with tax cuts.</p>
        <p>The money for the tax cuts would come in the form of a rebate of more than $45 million in unexpected utility taxes that the city collected during the last fiscal year. ''It is not a lot, but it is something,'' said Public Advocate Mark Green, a Democrat, who is a likely candidate for mayor in 2001.</p>
        <p>Officials said that the extra tax money came primarily from unexpected new Consolidated Edison customers. Michael Clendinin, a spokesman for Con Ed, said that it added more than 22,000 customers in its service area last year, about 6,000 of them businesses and the rest residential. But higher electricity costs are also expected to raise tax revenue in the future.</p>
        <p>City officials estimate that out of the $45 million, they collected roughly $13 million in extra taxes and the state collected the rest. Mr. Green said he would call on state legislators to return $32 million to New York City residents.</p>
        <p>''Since it is a regressive tax and it especially hurts high-tech companies, the excess that the city has obtained should be rebated to customers,'' Mr. Green said.</p>
        <p>But the extra tax is arriving just when city officials have expressed concern about anticipated budget deficits in future years, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has announced his intention to scale back some plans for personal income tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Last week legislative leaders and several representatives of local utilities met at City Hall to discuss growing concerns about the increases. Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and Mayor Giuliani discussed rising energy costs, officials said, and Mr. Green's office requested data from Con Ed explaining the price increases and calculating how much extra money customers were paying.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Vallone said that when it came to reducing any type of energy costs, anything, including a tax rebate or requests for a return to more regulation of the industry, would be considered.</p>
