        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Paul Krugman (''Saints and Profits,'' column, July 23) attacks Public Citizen for its efforts to get the arthritis drug Feldene taken off the market. Our 1994 petition to the Food and Drug Administration to ban the drug was prompted by eight published studies that compared the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation or ulcers from Feldene with as many as seven other similar drugs.</p>
        <p>Of drugs available in the United States, in four of the eight studies, Feldene had the highest risk of these severe gastrointestinal effects; in three studies, Feldene had the second highest risk; and in one study, the third highest risk.</p>
        <p>Since our book ''Worst Pills, Best Pills'' lists many safer, equally effective alternatives to Feldene, Mr. Krugman's theory that the ban reflects part of the ''general hostility toward corporations'' seems fatuous.</p>

        <p>The writer is the director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group.</p>
