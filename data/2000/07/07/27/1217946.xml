        <p>The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater roared into the New York State Theater on Tuesday night, courtesy of the Lincoln Center Festival. The audience welcomed the charismatic Ailey dancers with the fervor of the hungry greeting a platterful of large and juicy steaks. But the program had its disappointments.</p>
        <p>Judith Jamison's ''Double Exposure'' had the look of an occasion piece, a big shiny bauble of a world premiere for the festival tree. As Ailey himself was wont to point out, it is not an easy matter to create new dances while running the company that performs them, as Ms. Jamison does today.</p>
        <p>''Double Exposure'' must have looked good on paper: a hip multimedia work with a sleek jazz score commissioned from Robert Ruggieri, with whom Ms. Jamison has worked before, and even sleeker visuals. Created by The Company ''V,'' credited by the program with the dance's ''electronic environment design,'' and by Art in Commerce, credited with the ''media concept and creation,'' the visuals overwhelmed an already meager choreographic component.</p>
        <p>The central figure was Matthew Rushing, seen in the opening moments alone onstage in the center of a handsome bull's-eye spotlight. Two large screens rose behind him. Throughout the piece, in which Mr. Rushing was joined by three women (Dwana Adiaha Smallwood, Bahiyah Sayyed and Asha Thomas) and another man (Glenn A. Sims), soft-edged images were projected of the dancers' bodies and faces, water and what appeared to be clouds and stellar bodies shot from outer space.</p>
        <p>There was an inexplicable change of costumes. Surface and decoration were everything in this combining of dance and new-media design. Tethered in one spot or another, the dancers would suddenly turn to stare at one another or some spot on the environment. The movement was more posturing than purposeful, part of the unhappy fallout, perhaps, from Ulysses Dove's choreographic experimentation with heartless propulsion. It did not help that ''Double Exposure'' followed Ronald K. Brown's ''Grace'' on the program. In a different sequence, some of the light patterns, cross-stage travel and placement of the dancers might not have looked so familiar.</p>
        <p>In ''Double Exposure'' Diva Gray's explosive, silky singing brought thoughts of Gabriel serenading the heaven-bound, adding a bit of warmth to Mr. Ruggieri's rather chill percussive score. Ms. Gray was joined in the pit by the singers Gordon Grody, Andrea Monteiro and Fonzi Thorton and by Jorge Amorim and Ze Mauricio (percussion) and Jason Bodner (harmonium). Emilio Sosa designed the stylish costumes. The lighting was by Al Crawford III.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown's ''Grace'' spread its wings and soared in the expansive stage space of the State Theater. Essentially a handsomely designed play of light and movement, ''Grace'' blends the ecstasy of everyday religious worship with the ecstatic physicality seen in some forms of African dance. The piece, created last year for the Ailey company and set to music by Duke Ellington, Roy Davis Jr., Paul Johnson and Fela Anikulapo Kuti, excitingly juxtaposes urgent, rooted whole-body movement with stylish shifting lineups that recall the moves of rock backup singers in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>Renee Robinson was the solemn spiritual matriarch of the piece, with Ms. Thomas also standing out in the cast of 12 dancers for the extraordinary fullness and abandon of her dancing. The lighting and costumes, by William H. Grant III and Omatayo Wunmi Olaiya, contributed to the powerful stage picture.</p>
        <p>Ailey's ''Revelations'' ended the program with a bang. Over the years this classic has become a dance about physical rather than emotional catharsis, regrettably but perhaps inevitably. In ''I Wanna Be Ready,'' Jeffrey Gerodias was impressive for his quiet eloquence and a simplicity that recalled Dudley Williams's standard-setting interpretation of the solo. There was a compellingly subtle edge of despair to the all-out, urgent dancing of Clifton Brown, Mr. Rushing and Troy O'Neil Powell in the ''Sinner Man'' trio.</p>
        <p>The score of traditional songs, conducted by Tania Leon, was sung exhilaratingly by Ms. Gray, Gale Limansky, T. Ray Lawrence, Billy Porter, Ella Mitchell and Curtis Rayam. The program will be repeated tomorrow and Saturday nights and Sunday afternoon at the State Theater. An all-Ailey program will be performed tonight and Saturday afternoon.</p>
