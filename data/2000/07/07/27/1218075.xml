      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An extraordinary write-off from expenses in the film business caused the Sony Corporation to report an 88.29 billion yen ($810 million) loss for the April-June quarter, compared with a profit of 18.43 billion yen the year before. But even when the one-time expense is excluded, Sony's profits fell 20 percent to 33.7 billion yen ($309 million), reflecting the impact of the strong yen and weakness in its PlayStation business. Strong sales of Sony's hardware products worldwide like the Vaio brand of personal computers, digital cameras and DVD video players helped to compensate for the weakness. Sony sales for the quarter rose 5.4 percent, to 1.56 trillion yen.</p>
