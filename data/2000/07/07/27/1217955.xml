        <p>A Heritage Preserved</p>
        <p>As their communities were declining, from the 1920's through the 40's, the Shakers in towns like Watervliet and Mt. Lebanon, N.Y., began working with curators at the New York State Museum in Albany to preserve their heritage. The museum built a collection of more than 100,000 objects, including examples of furniture and tools. Some of these artifacts, as well as vintage photographs of Shaker life, are on view at the museum in ''The Shaker Legacy,'' opening on Saturday. Information: (518) 474-5877.</p>
        <p>Free Sample</p>
        <p>This year's Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center begins on Monday night at 8 with a free outdoor concert at Damrosch Park. Gerard Schwarz is to conduct the festival orchestra in a program of Beethoven, Bizet and, mostly, Mozart, including his Violin Concerto No. 3 in G, with Jennifer Frautschi as soloist. Among the other first-week highlights are the opening gala at Avery Fisher Hall on Tuesday and Wednesday nights with the soprano Carol Vaness and the pianist Peter Serkin, and the festival debut of the countertenor David Daniels with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment at Alice Tully Hall next Thursday night. The festival ends on Aug. 26. Information: (212) 875-5399.</p>
        <p>Before the Wrecking Ball</p>
        <p>The parish house behind the Judson Memorial Church, at 55 Washington Square South in Greenwich Village, is to be demolished next week, but the church's cultural mission will be celebrated starting tonight with a four-day festival. Performance artists, choreographers and musicians will perform along the route taken by tours of the building, every half-hour from 7 to 10 each night. An open house from 4 to 6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday will feature work by artists like Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg and Allan Kaprow. Information: (212) 529-3626.</p>

        <p>Correction:  July 29, 2000, Saturday  A book review on Thursday about ''Liberace: An American Boy,'' by Darden Asbury Pyron, included an imprecise attribution from the book for a comment supposedly made by the pianist in the face of an adverse review. It was a 1954 TV Guide article about Liberace that quoted him as saying he had ''laughed all the way to the bank.'' (Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, cited elsewhere in the biography, is the source for a different version of the remark -- from Liberace's 1973 autobiography: ''I cried all the way to the bank.'')</p>
