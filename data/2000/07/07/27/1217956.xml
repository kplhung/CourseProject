        <p>MR. SNOOZLEBERG, sound asleep, walks in slippered feet toward the lion's cage.  If the cage door is closed, he will bump into it and awaken, finding himself in his pajamas, miles from home, confused and penniless. If the cage is open, he will walk into the lion's mouth. And if he somehow gets by the lion, he still has a couple of seals, a gorilla and several very prickly porcupines to get past. It's a good thing you're watching out for the poor guy.</p>
        <p>Part puzzle game, part slapstick cartoon, Sarbakan's Good Night, Mr. Snoozleberg is one of the best games you can play on the Internet and one of the best puzzle games of the last few years.

        <p>MR. SNOOZLEBERG, sound asleep, walks in slippered feet toward the lion's cage.  If the cage door is closed, he will bump into it and awaken, finding himself in his pajamas, miles from home, confused and penniless. If the cage is open, he will walk into the lion's mouth. And if he somehow gets by the lion, he still has a couple of seals, a gorilla and several very prickly porcupines to get past. It's a good thing you're watching out for the poor guy.</p>
        <p>Part puzzle game, part slapstick cartoon, Sarbakan's Good Night, Mr. Snoozleberg is one of the best games you can play on the Internet and one of the best puzzle games of the last few years. It is one of many Shockwave games that have been created using the multimedia animation tool Macromedia Flash, and one of the precious few whose entertainment value rivals those of commercial games.</p>
        <p>In Snoozleberg, the player is responsible for keeping a sleepwalking diplomat asleep and alive as he wanders through carnivals, back alleys, sound stages and alien spaceships. In each episode, Mr. Snoozleberg has something important to do the next day, so if he doesn't make it back into bed by morning, an actor will not be presented with his award or there will be no one available to negotiate with aliens. Mr. Snoozleberg is a very important person.</p>
        <p>The premise of the game will be familiar to anyone who has watched enough old Warner Brothers cartoons: someone who is sleepwalking, in shock or witless walks through a dangerous area like a construction site and is saved from death or dismemberment by blind luck. As the sleepwalker is just about to step off the edge of the building or be crushed under a cement block, a beam will swing into place or an elevator will open its doors and disaster will be averted. It is as though the hand of God reaches out to save these cartoon characters.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Snoozleberg, you are that hand, dropping something heavy on the head of a waiting alligator or laying a beam across the space between two roofs before Mr. Snoozleberg can plummet to the sidewalk. Do your job right and Mr. Snoozleberg will never know he has been out of bed.</p>
        <p>The mechanics of the game are simple and, for the most part, involve nothing more than clicking on the right object at the right time. If Mr. Snoozleberg is about to walk past the window of a woman in her underwear, pull down the shade before she sees him and screams. Don't pull it down too soon or it will flip up at just the wrong time. Sometimes you'll have to move an object to a new location or spin something Mr. Snoozleberg is walking on to redirect him.</p>
        <p>Flash has become a powerful tool for Internet creativity. There are increasing numbers of miniature movies, simple games and elaborate Web sites all run by the Shockwave player, a free download. The quality of these Shockwave products varies, and most of the games are nothing but retreads of computer games from the 1980's, not worth the several minutes it can take to load a game using a 56K modem.</p>
        <p>The most striking thing about Snoozleberg, and about Sarbakan's other game, the excellent adventure game Arcane, is how ambitious they are. It is common to see simple, dumb games like Cheesy Poofs, in which you slide an open-mouthed character from the television cartoon ''South Park'' back and forth in front of a steady stream of snacks, or Elvira Monster Smash, in which you drop pumpkins on ghouls. But Snoozleberg is something else: a complete game with simple but detailed graphics, catchy cocktail-lounge music and many levels, each containing a large number of puzzles.</p>
        <p>The better Flash games, like Leo's Great Day, are short, but it takes many hours to complete Snoozleberg. You cannot play the game without thinking that this is as good as any puzzle game you can buy. Lemmings Revolution may have the latest in 3D graphics, but Snoozleberg gives you the same degree of wit and ingenuity.</p>
        <p>Given the limitations of online games, it is remarkable how much variety there is in this one. There are hundreds of ways in which Mr. Snoozleberg's dreams can be interrupted. Slapstick cops, troubadors and bumper cars are all laying in wait for the poor man, and alligators seem to be lurking everywhere, driving garbage trucks and exploring deep space, always ready for a snack. Some of the ways in which Mr. Snoozleberg is awakened are quite entertaining, and you want to fail once at each puzzle just to see what will happen.</p>
        <p>It is rare to find Flash used to its full potential. For every game like Good Night, Mr. Snoozleberg or Sissy Fight, on which the designers have obviously spent a lot of time and effort, there are a dozen simple, repetitive games that could have been created in a week or less. It would be nice if more Flash designers chose to create games of the caliber of Sarbakan's offerings. Perhaps Good Night, Mr. Snoozleberg will be their wake-up call.</p>
