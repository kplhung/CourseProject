        <p>A Florida subsidiary of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York proposed yesterday to gradually eliminate a $4.8 million shortfall in its reserves by laying off 41 workers, cutting other costs and raising insurance premiums, company officials said.</p>
        <p>Florida regulators placed the subsidiary under special supervision last week. State officials said they were not likely to decide until next week whether to accept or reject the company's plan.</p>
        <p>David Abernethy, the executive director of the subsidiary, HIP Health Plan of Florida, said company officials were asking the regulators to be patient and give them until March 2001 to restore its reserves to the required levels.</p>
        <p>If the plan is accepted, he said, the subsidiary will continue to operate until that time under administrative supervision, meaning that it could not sign up any new customers, and that it could not make any expenditures of more than $10,000 without approval from the Florida Department of Insurance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abernethy said the subsidiary also was trying to negotiate a joint venture with another health care company that might pump more money into the operation.</p>
