        <p>Letting Go of Plane And of Kennedy</p>
        <p>JOHN F. KENNEDY JR.'s first airplane -- a single-engine Cessna that he sold when he bought the more powerful Piper Saratoga in which he died last year -- will go on the block next month, a Florida auction company said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy flew the 1977 Cessna 182Q Skylane for training and cross-country flights, said LOUIS B. FISHER III of the Fisher Auction Company of Pompano Beach, Fla. The plane is registered to a New Jersey corporation whose principal did not want to be identified, Mr. Fisher said.</p>
        <p>''The seller was close to John and the Kennedy family,'' he said. ''It's a constant reminder of the tragedy, and he just wants to move it out. He's concerned because of the notoriety of the plane when he flies into an airport that doesn't have security.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisher said he could not guess what the plane would sell for.</p>
        <p>He added that Mr. Kennedy bought the Cessna in 1998 from the man who is now selling it. That person, he said, bought it back when Mr. Kennedy switched to the Piper in May 1999. Mr. Fisher said that the Cessna had been kept at the Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J.</p>
        <p>Not Your Usual Lounge Lizard</p>
        <p>DENISE RICH has written songs for such performers as CELINE DION, JOHNNY MATHIS, DONNA SUMMER and JUDY COLLINS. But she wanted PATTI LABELLE to sing her latest tune, ''In Over Your Heart.''</p>
        <p>''Patti was Gabrielle's favorite singer,'' Ms. Rich said during a party to introduce the song and a new perfume. Gabrielle was her daughter, who died of leukemia in 1996 at 27. The perfume ''reminded me of the scents my daughter always used,'' Ms. Rich said, and proceeds from the first 1,000 bottles sold will go to her G&amp;P Charitable Foundation for Cancer Research.</p>
        <p>Ms. Labelle said she was singing free -- ''You're getting Patti the lounge lizard,'' she told the crowd. ''I would do anything for Denise and Gabrielle.''</p>
        <p>Including sight-read ''In Over Your Heart.''</p>
        <p>''The song is so new, I don't know the lyrics yet, but I have paper,'' she said. Then she mentioned Escada, the company making the perfume. ''They made my outfit'' -- a rose and gold-paisley pantsuit -- ''and I told them I'm going to sing a lot of songs here and have a lot of costume changes, so I'll need more outfits.'' (In fact, she wore the same one all night.)</p>
        <p>Now at Sing Sing: A Guard's Life</p>
        <p>Here is a postscript on ''Newjack,'' TED CONOVER's book about the year he spent working as a corrections officer at Sing Sing: ''Newjack'' is no longer considered contraband there or at other prisons in New York State.</p>
        <p>Most of it, anyway.</p>
        <p>The Department of Correction decided to make the book available to inmates, but only after removing six pages. The pages in question deal with guards' duties during riots and escapes, as well as moves they learn to subdue inmates and the specifications of various weapons.</p>
        <p>''The only issues are safety and security in the system,'' said JAMES B. FLATEAU, a department spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conover said he was pleased the book would be going into circulation among inmates, but dismayed by the deletions.</p>
        <p>Still, the sniping continues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flateau said some department employees were upset with Mr. Conover's subterfuge: he took a job as a corrections officer to write a book, but did not tell his colleagues of his plans. GLENN S. GOORD, the commissioner, said in a statement that employees had complained that they felt betrayed and had been misquoted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conover said that some officers might feel betrayed, but that the employees he had heard from had had nothing but good things to say about the book. He also took issue with the suggestion that parts of ''Newjack'' could compromise the safety of prison guards.</p>
        <p>DENNIS FITZPATRICK, the spokesman for the corrections officers' union, sided with Mr. Conover. ''What he did was admirable,'' Mr. Fitzpatrick said. ''He depicted what an officer faces on a daily basis.''</p>
