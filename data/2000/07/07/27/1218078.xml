        <p>Alcatel, the French company that sells technology equipment for telecommunications companies, said yesterday that it had named Arnold Communications in Boston to handle creative and media duties for its American operations, based in Plano, Tex. Spending for the next few months was estimated at at least $40 million; annual spending was estimated at $100 million.</p>
        <p>The American Alcatel assignment had been handled for two years by Euro RSCG/DSW Partners in Salt Lake City until they parted ways in May. The selection of Arnold came without a review. Euro RSCG/DSW is part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, which has agreed to buy the Arnold parent, Snyder Communications.</p>
