        <p>Editorial on Defense Sec William Cohen's new guidelines on how to stop anti-gay harassment in military calls for repeal of ban on openly gay service members; holds ban fuels anti-gay bias</p>

        <p>No amount of anti-harassment training can correct the injustice of the ban on openly gay service members in the United States military. Last week Defense Secretary William Cohen released yet another set of guidelines on how to stop anti-gay harassment. But this new action plan, like previous guidelines, will most likely prove ineffective because the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy on which it is based is unworkable. The way to curb harassment is to allow gays to serve openly without fear of expulsion if they report harassment.</p>
        <p>The policy adopted in 1993 was supposed to provide more humane treatment for gays by allowing them to serve if they did not disclose their sexual orientation or engage in homosexual conduct. It has instead forced gays to lie, and has resulted in more harassment and a near doubling in the numbers of people being discharged annually on the basis of homosexuality.</p>

        <p>No amount of anti-harassment training can correct the injustice of the ban on openly gay service members in the United States military. Last week Defense Secretary William Cohen released yet another set of guidelines on how to stop anti-gay harassment. But this new action plan, like previous guidelines, will most likely prove ineffective because the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy on which it is based is unworkable. The way to curb harassment is to allow gays to serve openly without fear of expulsion if they report harassment.</p>
        <p>The policy adopted in 1993 was supposed to provide more humane treatment for gays by allowing them to serve if they did not disclose their sexual orientation or engage in homosexual conduct. It has instead forced gays to lie, and has resulted in more harassment and a near doubling in the numbers of people being discharged annually on the basis of homosexuality.</p>
        <p>The new plan calls for more anti-harassment training and sanctions against those who engage in or tolerate harassment. But victims of harassment could still be ousted if they happen to disclose their sexual orientation in the course of making a complaint. This absurd situation forces victims who want to keep their jobs to suffer in silence.</p>
        <p>Homophobia in the military today is undeniable. Even Mr. Cohen has said that anti-gay harassment seriously undermines discipline and order. The only real solution is for Congress and the president to repeal the ban that was written into law in 1993 and continues to fuel anti-gay bias.</p>
