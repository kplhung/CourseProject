        <p>The flight may not be as comfortable as business class on a 747 and it does not offer a choice of a dozen movies -- or any movies, for that matter -- but crossing the Atlantic in just over three hours on the supersonic Concorde, versus seven or nine hours on standard jets, is well worth the cost and relative discomfort, passengers said yesterday.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of the crash of a chartered Air France Concorde outside Paris on Tuesday, which killed all 109 people on the airplane and 4 people on the ground, most members of the elite club that is the Concorde's clientele had few qualms about flying on the jet again.</p>
        <p>''When I heard about the crash, obviously I was horrified,'' said John Demsey, president of Mac Cosmetics, who flies on the Concorde often and was planning to ride it from New York to Paris yesterday on his way to the island of Capri.</p>
        <p>His trip was delayed after Air France suspended all of its Concorde flights until the airline is convinced that the planes are safe. But Mr. Demsey said he had been ready to take his flight even after he had heard about the crash.</p>
        <p>''Up to this point the plane has had a safety record as good or better than any other plane,'' he said. ''I would definitely fly it again.''</p>
        <p>British Airways, the other airline that flies the Concorde, resumed its New York to London service yesterday after having canceled some flights on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Passengers who are normally consigned to economy class might smirk to hear the Concorde, which costs more than $10,000 for a full-fare round-trip ticket, described as a business tool. But that is how many of its habitues refer to it.</p>
        <p>Air France says two-thirds of its Concorde passengers are traveling on business, while the rest are celebrities, the super-rich or vacationers like the members of the German tour group who died in the crash.</p>
        <p>For business executives the advantage of the Concorde, which cruises twice as high as conventional jets and, at 1,350 miles an hour, twice as fast, is not just time saved in the air. It is time saved on the ground.</p>
        <p>British Airways and Air France have designed their Concorde services so that passengers can avoid the increasingly common hassles of modern jet travel. Concorde passengers can show up a half-hour before the flight departs and are whisked through check-in and immigration. Their luggage is delivered to them within minutes of arrival.</p>
        <p>The Concorde's speed allows executives to put in a full day of work in London, hop on the 7 p.m. Concorde and arrive back in New York the same day at 6 p.m. With the number of cross-border mergers on the rise in industries like entertainment, finance, telecommunications and energy, many executives are finding that they are having to travel back and forth to Europe regularly.</p>
        <p>The Concorde also allows travelers to Europe to arrive early enough to connect to other destinations the same day. Indeed, the Concorde is the only daytime flight that arrives on the Continent in the afternoon. The alternative for many travelers is to take an overnight flight and try to sleep on the plane.</p>
        <p>''I don't sleep well on planes,'' Mr. Demsey said. ''To me it buys back two days.''</p>
        <p>Besides, one of the Concorde's dirty secrets is that few of its regulars pay the top fare. Most fly so often that they or their companies have cut deals with the airlines for discounts as much as 30 percent, or the price of a business-class ticket, which on Air France is $7,050.</p>
        <p>Passengers also use frequent-flyer miles to upgrade to the Concorde.</p>
        <p>''It is not as if it is either the Concorde or they are going to swim,'' Richard Nigosian, president of Bond Street Travel in Manhattan, said of the customers he books on the Concorde. Most of his customers believe that the added cost is well worth it, since it means they can do more business.</p>
        <p>''For people who earn millions of dollars a year, it really does pay for itself,'' he said.</p>
