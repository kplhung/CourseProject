        <p>Not so long ago the nonprofit Roundabout Theater Company was performing plays for 150 people in a supermarket basement on West 26th Street where a scene from Ibsen or Shaw might well be accompanied by the sound of rolling meat carts rumbling through the ceiling.</p>
        <p>Tonight, the company will open its first show -- a revival of ''The Man Who Came to Dinner'' -- in its elegant new 750-seat theater, the once-crumbling Selwyn on West 42nd Street, transformed at a cost of $25 million.</p>
        <p>The showplace was named the American Airlines Theater in exchange for an $8.5 million payment from American. Patrons who contribute $1,500 or more to the Roundabout each year can relax before the show over cocktails and Oreo cookies in the Nabisco lounge (so named in exchange for $500,000). The rest of the theater's subscribers can catch the sunset from the balcony of the new penthouse lobby (name still for sale at $1.5 million).</p>
        <p>The Roundabout, which produces seven shows each season, has built its subscriber base to 46,000 from 17,000 in 1983  through customer-friendly programs like wine tastings and early-bird curtain times, and a sophisticated fund-raising operation in which 20 to 30 people work the phones to generate new subscriptions, renewals and outright contributions.</p>
        <p>The theater spent $60,000 last year on lobbying the city and the state, more than the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which spent $49,000. When the Selwyn was not finished in time for ''Uncle Vanya'' to go in as planned last spring, the Roundabout placed the play in Broadway's Brooks Atkinson Theater at a cost of about $1.5 million, a figure that by itself is more than the annual budget of most nonprofit theaters. The artistic director, Todd Haimes, earns an annual salary of $275,000.</p>
        <p>To some extent, the journey of this one nonprofit theater -- from basement to Broadway, from bankruptcy to becoming the country's second-largest nonprofit theater with an annual budget of $20 million -- stands as a powerful example of how much the world of nonprofit theater has changed.</p>
        <p>It is ''almost a metaphor for the progress of the not-for-profit theater,'' said Bernard Gersten, executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, the largest nonprofit with a budget of about $25 million.</p>
        <p>''From the time that the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1971 took its first play to Broadway -- for the past 29 years -- there has been an evolution that's been marked by the invasion of the for-profit theater by the not-for-profit theater,'' Mr. Gersten continued. ''I view it as irrevocable, irresistible, inevitable and great.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone is as enthusiastic about some of the qualities of the Roundabout's success, epitomized by its new theater in the heart of the new Times Square. Several commercial producers resent that the theater's productions are eligible for Tony Awards (they have won 13) without having the financial burdens of repaying investors or paying the labor costs required under Broadway union contracts. And some nonprofit stalwarts suggest that, by peddling naming rights in its theater to corporations and performing palatable Broadway fare, the Roundabout has sold out.</p>
        <p>''There used to be an unpredictable, dangerous energy in the air,'' said Jim Niesen, who worked for the Roundabout as a stage manager 20 years ago and left to start his own experimental theater company, the Irondale Ensemble Project. ''Now it's so cookie-cutter.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Haimes, who has led the Roundabout since 1983, makes no apologies for his theater's growth. ''As you get bigger, perhaps you have to leave the highly experimental productions behind for smaller companies to do, and that, I guess, is an institutional loss,'' he said. ''But I think it's a loss that's far outweighed by having the resources to do first-class productions of classics and musicals on Broadway.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, it seems that most of the Roundabout's nonprofit peers -- and a few commercial ones as well -- applaud the Roundabout's success as good for the city and the theater overall. ''The demand is large enough that they need a Broadway theater,'' said Neil Pepe, artistic director of the Atlantic Theater Company. ''It's exciting.''</p>
        <p>Where nonprofit theaters like the Wooster Group and LaMaMa E.T.C. have emphasized experimental work, the Roundabout has always defined its mission as staging revivals, often of the classics. Over the years, that repertoire has expanded from the works of Ibsen, Shaw and Strindberg to contemporary work by Arthur Miller, Brian Friel and Harold Pinter as well as musicals.</p>
        <p>The last few years have been particularly successful ones for the company, with the theater winning Tony Awards for ''Anna Christie'' in 1993, ''She Loves Me'' in 1994, ''A View From the Bridge'' and ''Cabaret'' in 1998, and ''Little Me'' and ''Sideman'' in 1999.</p>
        <p>Tonight's show -- a revival of the Kaufman and Hart comedy that stars Nathan Lane and Jean Smart under the direction of Jerry Zaks -- is consistent with the Roundabout's history. And while it may seem like a safe choice, Mr. Haimes said it is actually risky to do a play with 29 actors (musicals with large casts appeal to more people and are therefore considered less of a gamble).</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Roundabout's defenders say, the company does the kinds of classics and musicals that Broadway would shy away from, like Chekhov's ''Uncle Vanya'' and ''Little Me,'' which starred Martin Short in the role originated by Sid Caesar.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the plays they're producing won't be produced in the commercial theater anymore -- can't be produced according to producers,'' said Roche Schulfer, executive director of the nonprofit Goodman Theater, which is about to build a $44 million theater complex in downtown Chicago. ''When Broadway starts doing what the Roundabout is doing, then they can say the Roundabout is becoming crassly commercial. But at this point, I don't see that happening.''</p>
        <p>While some commercial producers criticize the Roundabout for becoming too much like Broadway -- Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, recently wrote that Mr. Haimes ''has had a more pernicious influence on English-speaking theater than anyone since Oliver Cromwell'' -- other producers say they need nonprofits to take the chances they cannot afford. ''The two worlds are irrevocably interconnected and interdependent and I think for the good,'' said David Richenthal, a Broadway producer who brought the hit revival of ''Death of a Salesman'' to Broadway last season from the Goodman. ''I haven't done a commercial production that doesn't have some nexis with one or more not-for-profits. I don't see anything noxious about that.''</p>
        <p>The Roundabout has accepted increasingly popular ''enhancement'' money, which is controversial within the nonprofit world. Enhancement money is contributed to nonprofit productions by commercial producers who want to test their potential for future commercial runs. For its production of ''Cabaret,'' Mr. Haimes said, the Roundabout received enhancement money from SFX Theatrical in exchange for the right to own the tour. ''We wanted that because the costs were so huge,'' said Mr. Haimes, who added that SFX had no creative role in the show. ''Cabaret'' has cost the Roundabout a total of $4 million to stage.</p>
        <p>The sheer figures that the Roundabout deals in these days could hardly have been imagined earlier in its troubled life. ''If you had placed money on the next theater that might fold in the 1980's, it would have been the Roundabout,'' said Ben Cameron, executive director of the Theater Communications Group, a support organization for nonprofit theaters. Founded by Gene Feist in 1965, the theater  declared bankruptcy in 1978 and voted to close down in 1983. It moved from the supermarket, now a Food Emporium, to what became a movie theater in Chelsea to a former union hall in Union Square to the Criterion Center on Broadway and 45th Street, where it first became Tony eligible because of location. It was served with an eviction notice at the Criterion just as Mr. Haimes decided on the Selwyn.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Haimes is clearly proud of the progress, he said he is also anxious about sustaining the high expectations. ''I think about how much money this theater has to generate on a weekly basis to break even,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That would be about $400,000 per week, according to Ellen Richard, the Roundabout's managing director since 1984. When Mr. Haimes first came on board in 1983, the break-even figure was $30,000.</p>
        <p>The Roundabout raises 25 percent of its budget in contributions. To build its new theater, Mr. Haimes said the Roundabout received $9 million from the city and more than $1 million from the state</p>
        <p>''If our subscriptions went down from 45,000 to 30,000, it would be devastating,'' Mr. Haimes said. His next goal is to build up the endowment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haimes said corporate arrangements like his with American Airlines, which is spread out over 10 years, help ward off financial insecurity. ''As long as the corporation is not interested in affecting the artistic decisions,'' he said, ''I'm happy to have their name on the lounge or on the building.''</p>
        <p>With government money far harder to come by than it was a few years ago and costs rising, arts institutions like the Roundabout have no choice but to tap new resources, some nonprofit executives say. ''It's the next logical step,'' said Mr. Cameron.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless there are those who are troubled by corporate labeling in nonprofit cultural venues in particular, saying it creates the appearance that a theater is presenting shows in some substantial part to serve the commercial purpose of a sponsor.</p>
        <p>Robert Marx, vice president of the Samuels Foundation, an arts donor, said the Roundabout's was a wait-see situation. ''There is no such thing as corporate philanthropy -- it's a contract for services,'' he said. ''I think the Roundabout has to be very careful.''</p>
        <p>Many nonprofit and commercial theater professionals attribute criticism of the Roundabout to envy. ''It's too easy to point the finger at them; it's motivated by jealousy,'' said David Herskovits, the artistic director of Target Margin, an off-Broadway theater company with an annual budget of $300,000. ''We are all engaged in commerce all the time. We're all concerned about getting bucks into the bank.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, nonprofit executives say, their nonprofit roots have been romanticized, as if they must continually struggle financially in order to remain true to their origins.</p>
        <p>''It's the process of life -- you leave your little one-bedroom and you buy a house and people say you betrayed the fact that you were once a hippie,'' said Gordon Edelstein, the artistic director of A Contemporary Theater (ACT), which recently built a $32 million complex in Seattle. ''Just as it's our children's job to keep us honest and to be rebellious, it's the job of smaller, funky theaters to carry on.''</p>
