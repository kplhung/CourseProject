        <p>Saying that she may have gone beyond the White House position on the charged issue of Middle East peace, Hillary Rodham Clinton said yesterday that she spoke out of her own conviction when she called for cutting off United States aid if the Palestinians unilaterally declared statehood.</p>
        <p>After the Middle East peace talks broke down on Tuesday at Camp David, Mrs. Clinton issued a statement urging both sides to continue negotiations and called for a cutoff in assistance to the Palestinian Authority should Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, move to declare a state on his own.</p>
        <p>''It must be clear that any unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood would be entirely unacceptable and should be met with a cutoff of United States assistance,'' she said in the statement.</p>
        <p>Asked yesterday if she was going beyond what the Clinton administration had called for, she said flatly: ''I may be. It's what I believe.''</p>
        <p>Aides to Representative Rick A. Lazio, her opponent for the United States Senate, said he had already signed on as a sponsor to a bill that would do the same thing. A similar bill is being sponsored by Senator Charles E. Schumer, one of Mrs. Clinton's strongest allies. Both bills were scheduled to be introduced yesterday evening. The Palestinian Authority received $100 million in American aid in fiscal year 2000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat has said that he will declare Palestinian statehood if no agreement is reached by Sept. 13.  The Clinton administration has not called for the severing of aid, but has instead pressed both sides to resume peace talks.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, who was lambasted last year for her embrace of Mr. Arafat's wife, Suha, yesterday explicitly distanced herself from the Palestinian cause, singling out Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, for showing ''enormous courage and vision and an extraordinary commitment to these peace talks.''</p>
        <p>What about Mr. Arafat, she was asked. ''He participated,'' Mrs. Clinton said simply. ''And I hope he will continue to participate in the ongoing discussions that were promised.''</p>
        <p>Her reflections on the peace talks came during a campaign stop yesterday afternoon at the Florence Nightingale Health Center, a nursing home in East Harlem. Mrs. Clinton introduced a $500 million proposal to raise staffing levels and safety standards in nursing homes.</p>
        <p>Citing a recent federal study that found perilous levels of understaffing in nursing homes nationwide, Mrs. Clinton's proposal would use the money to reward nursing homes that met federal standards and penalize those that did not. The proposal also calls for publishing on the Internet the staff-to-patient ratios and the safety records of all nursing homes.</p>
        <p>''Too many places in our country are failing to honor our duty to American seniors,'' she told an audience of frail, elderly nursing home residents.</p>
        <p>She pointedly attacked Mr. Lazio for voting, along with his Republican colleagues, for a 1995 bill that would have eliminated national nursing home safety standards. Mr. Lazio's spokesman, Bryan Flood, said the bill would have turned Medicaid into a block grant program, leaving states responsible for creating their own nursing home standards. The bill ultimately did not pass.</p>
