        <p>Gov. George W. Bush and his new running mate, Dick Cheney, made a whirlwind visit today to the vice-presidential contender's home state, defending Mr. Cheney's conservative voting record and vowing that the ticket would ''renew America's purpose.''</p>
        <p>In their first campaign trip, Mr. Bush struck more partisan tones than usual, hammering away at the integrity and trustworthiness of the Clinton administration. He presented the all-Western Republican ticket as the antidote.</p>
        <p>''Dick and I both have roots in the West,'' Mr. Bush of Texas told a chanting crowd packed into the gymnasium of the high school Mr. Cheney, 59, attended more than 40 years ago. ''The West is a place full of straightforward people who usually say what they mean and mean what they say.''</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Bush reached back to one of President Clinton's well-known evasions in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. ''The West is full of people who understand the meaning of what the word 'is' is,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A day after Mr. Bush announced that he had selected his father's former defense secretary as his running mate, the Texas governor was quickly hit with questions about Mr. Cheney's voting record in his six terms in the House. He and the Gore campaign engaged in a fierce cross-country competition to define what  voters thought about Mr. Cheney.</p>
        <p>''I obviously thought about the record,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And this is a conservative man. So am I.''</p>
        <p>The governor and his aides said the selection of Mr. Cheney showed that Mr. Bush was putting political considerations aside to make a sober-minded decision on a running mate who could serve as commander in chief.</p>
        <p>''He brings some strength to the administration,'' Mr. Bush said in a  news conference.</p>
        <p>''It speaks volumes that I'm willing to pick somebody who is as strong a man as he is,'' Mr. Bush said, ''that I'm comfortable with having excellence by my side.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats also said the choice spoke volumes, about whether Mr. Bush really is a new kind of Republican or a throwback to the past. They pointed to Mr. Cheney's  conservative voting record as well as his service in the administrations of Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and George Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's record included votes against the Head Start education program, against banning so-called ''cop-killer'' bullets, against imposing economic sanctions on the government of South Africa and against a nonbinding House resolution calling for the release of the anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela.</p>
        <p>''I'm generally proud of my record in the House,'' Mr. Cheney told reporters. He said that he could ''probably find some'' votes ''that I might tweak and do differently.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney defended his votes, largely cast in the Reagan administration, as appropriate to the 1980's  ''when we had huge budget deficits, no money and when we really had to be concerned about controlling federal spending.''</p>
        <p>''Today we're in a different era,'' he said. ''We've got a surplus. We've got the opportunity now I think to go do some things we could not have done 20 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Pressed by reporters to explain his stance on Mr. Mandela, Mr. Cheney said he had voted against sanctions on South Africa because he has generally opposed unilateral sanctions.</p>
        <p>The Republicans also turned aside Democratic questions about their links to the oil industry. Mr. Cheney is stepping down as the chief executive of the Halliburton Company, a worldwide oil services companies based in Dallas.</p>
        <p>''I'm very proud of Halliburton,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''I have nothing to apologize for.'' He described it as a company that had started small as the brainchild of one man and become ''the quintessential American success story.'' Mr. Bush said his opponents were trying to ''divert attention from the fact that the Democrats have no energy policy.''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign presented the trip to Natrona High School as a sentimental journey to the hometown where Mr. Cheney met his wife, Lynne. He was the class president and a captain of the football team. She was the prom queen, and as Mr. Bush added today, a ''nationally ranked champion baton twirler.''</p>
        <p>It was not a long and lingering homecoming. The appearance in the school, the lone rally of the day, lasted about 45 minutes. Aides said Mr. Cheney had to return to Dallas for a business meeting.</p>
        <p>A cheering crowd in the hundreds packed the gym and another 1,000 people waited in a spillover room.</p>
        <p>Gov. Jim Geringer warmed up the audience and dismissed the talk of Mr. Cheney's voting record. ''I'd rather have Vice President Cheney with his heart, than President Gore with no backbone,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney gazed out at the crowd and said, ''They never treated me this well when I was their congressman.'' And he joked that when he and his wife were in high school, many would have expected her to return one day along with the candidates for president and vice president. ''But they never would have guessed it was going to be me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Bush, not his running mate, who seemed in a feisty mood. As he brought Mr. Cheney down the aisle of his campaign plane, reporters asked the governor what he thought of the Democrats' reaction to Mr. Cheney.</p>
        <p>''What was it?'' he asked. ''Belittling? I'm not surprised that they would try to belittle the pick. Typical.''</p>
