        <p>Five months after the New Jersey Supreme Court chided state officials for not moving quickly enough, lawyers for 30 poor urban school districts said yesterday that the State Department of Education was still not meeting the court's repeated orders to provide meaningful preschool programs for 49,000 eligible 3- and 4-year-olds.</p>
        <p>The Education Law Center, based in Newark, which represents the districts in the landmark Abbott v. Burke school financing case, released a report saying the state had failed to comply with a Supreme Court order in March that urged the state to move more quickly to fulfill the court's 1998 order to provide good-quality preschool programs in the so-called Abbott districts. The court called for a maximum class size of 15 students, led by certified teachers, with a full range of special education and other programs.</p>

        <p>Five months after the New Jersey Supreme Court chided state officials for not moving quickly enough, lawyers for 30 poor urban school districts said yesterday that the State Department of Education was still not meeting the court's repeated orders to provide meaningful preschool programs for 49,000 eligible 3- and 4-year-olds.</p>
        <p>The Education Law Center, based in Newark, which represents the districts in the landmark Abbott v. Burke school financing case, released a report saying the state had failed to comply with a Supreme Court order in March that urged the state to move more quickly to fulfill the court's 1998 order to provide good-quality preschool programs in the so-called Abbott districts. The court called for a maximum class size of 15 students, led by certified teachers, with a full range of special education and other programs.</p>
        <p>The court issued its March order after those standards were not met during the 1999-2000 school year, and the law center report concludes that they will not be met again in the coming school year, mainly because of the Education Department's failure to provide adequate guidance to the districts or set aside adequate funds for the programs.</p>
        <p>David Sciarra, director of the law center, said this year's appropriation of $200 million for the Abbott preschool programs was about half the real cost of programs that would meet the court's standards. The court, he contended, ''basically said, 'Look, the first year, 1999-2000, you didn't comply; you did nothing more than provide day care, in effect.' ''</p>
        <p>''And they basically directed the Department of Education,'' he said, ''to upgrade all the day care programs into well-run preschools. That's the court's term: 'well-run preschools.' ''</p>
        <p>But the state education commissioner, David C. Hespe, issued a statement today angrily rejecting the law center's conclusions. ''The only valid conclusion that can be drawn from this document is that the Education Law Center has very little first-hand knowledge about what is really going on in the Abbott districts,'' the statement said.</p>
        <p>The department said it had been working with districts to develop preschool programs that meet the court's standards. It said the $200 million budgeted this year, a $7.6 million increase over last year, was sufficient based on approved programs, and districts would be eligible for increases if their original figures were not sufficient. Contrary to the law center's report, the department said, all classes will have 15 students or fewer.</p>
        <p>But officials in some of the Abbott districts said that even when they  developed proposals for adequate programs on their own for the coming school year, the Education Department took so long to respond that many of those programs will not be ready by the start of the school year.</p>
        <p>Pablo Clausell, the superintendent in Perth Amboy, one of the Abbott districts, said he submitted his plan, with a request for an additional $3 million above last year's budget, the first week of May, and received a response only last week -- with a $700,000 increase. While the district waited, six certified teachers who had applied in his district accepted offers elsewhere, and supplies could not be ordered, he said.</p>
        <p>''We weren't able to move ahead,'' Mr. Clausell said. ''We have to begin purchasing equipment, the little chairs and so forth. Some of these things take six to eight weeks to get them in place.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sciarra called on Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to direct education officials to sit down with his group and the Abbott districts to work out a plan to meet the court's standards once and for all. If that happened immediately, he said, adequate programs could be in place by the middle of the coming school year.</p>
        <p>Governor Whitman's office did not respond to a request for comment.  But the law center's assertions were brushed aside by Chuck Leitgeb, a spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Jack Collins, who has tried to rein in spending on the Abbott districts.  ''I think the education law center operates under the premise that there is this unlimited supply of money,'' he said. ''And there's not.''</p>
