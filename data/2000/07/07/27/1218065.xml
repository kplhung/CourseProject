        <p>Statisticians call Marsha Hendrickson, a coal miner's daughter and the mother of four, functionally illiterate. With the national economy bubbling along, soaking up workers and spreading wealth, she and much of Appalachia live not only with poverty and unemployment but also with the humiliation of being taken for ignorant.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hendrickson dropped out of school in the eighth grade, at 15. Now 28, she does read. On shelves by her television set, she has a set of dictionaries, two romance novels and a Bible. At the Pic Pac grocery store, she tallies her purchases as she pushes her cart through the aisles. But she stumbles on long words, subtraction and division, and says the lack of skills makes her feel inadequate. So far, they have also contributed to making her unemployable.</p>
        <p>At a time that industry is scouring America for workers to keep it and the economy rolling, children in Kentucky's Appalachian hills as well as many in urban centers and impoverished stretches of the South are still dropping out of school at high rates, only to find themselves unequipped for any but the most menial jobs.</p>
        <p>Sounding the alarm, politicians and advocates for the poor have begun putting entrenched illiteracy at the root of privation in places like Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta, which economic growth has largely ignored.</p>
        <p>In his presidential campaign, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has declared illiteracy a ''national emergency,'' a view that his opponent, Vice President Al Gore has said he shares. To tackle it under a federal-state program called Even Start, Congress and the Clinton administration have increased aid to state literacy projects by nearly 50 percent, to $150 million, in three years.</p>
        <p>Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky, a Democrat, who observes that his state has the nation's lowest percentage of high school graduates, is doubling expenditures on literacy programs, like Even Start, to $34 million over two years.</p>
        <p>Across Eastern Kentucky's rural, time-worn cities and towns, government agencies, foundations and charities have opened storefront learning centers to coax people to study for the general education development test, the G.E.D, the equivalent of a high school diploma.</p>
        <p>Kentucky is also tightening enforcement of the law requiring students to stay in school until age 16.</p>
        <p>Typically, the functionally illiterate often struggle with all but the simplest arithmetic, reading a recipe, a map or the words on the keys of a McDonald's cash register. Often they cannot fill out a job application, type data into a computer, punctuate a paragraph, balance a checkbook or take a written test for a driver's license. (Kentucky lets people take the test orally.) In time, such difficulties can shred their self-esteem.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hendrickson, a G.E.D. student at the Sister Marjorie Learning Center in Pineville, is one of the people the literacy programs are trying to reach. Cheerful, well-groomed and a fastidious housekeeper, she said she had long wanted a job, and she is now under pressure to find work before she loses her welfare benefits under the 1996 welfare law.</p>
        <p>On her kitchen wall, Ms. Hendrickson has hung a certificate testifying to her completion of a job-readiness program that states have urged welfare recipients to take as they move off the rolls. But she remains stymied and stigmatized by the schooling she missed. ''What hurts me,'' she said, ''is I got no job history.''</p>
        <p>In applying for work at McDonald's, she was allowed seven wrong answers on the restaurant's food-handling test. ''I got eight,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She applied for a telemarketing job, soliciting sales on the telephone. ''I stayed for one day of training'' and gave up,'' she said. ''I felt those people watching me. I felt people laughing.''</p>
        <p>So far, people trying to earn the high school equivalency diploma in Kentucky are few. Janet Hoover, a spokeswoman in the state's Workforce Development Cabinet in Frankfort, says that each year the literacy programs are reaching only 5 percent of the state's one million functionally illiterate people. Because the dropout rate remains high, the total has barely been affected.</p>
        <p>That illiteracy is linked to poverty, unemployment and Appalachia's weak economy is hardly a secret. But for decades politicians attributed the region's poverty to its topography, isolation and the demise of coal mining. So they cut hundreds of miles of highways through the hollows and hills to bring in prosperity and well-paying jobs. But few jobs came, and the most employable workers used the highways to flee.</p>
        <p>In a survey published seven years ago for the Department of Education, the Educational Testing Service said that more than 1 in 5 adults 16 and older, 40 million people in the United States, could read and calculate at no better than the lowest of five levels of literacy, called Level 1.</p>
        <p>About a quarter of those 40 million people are non-English-speaking immigrants. The rest grew up speaking  English. Many are blacks who live in large cities and rural Southern communities. Several million others live in Appalachia, which is almost entirely white. The national survey, and one three years ago by the State of Kentucky, found that about 30 percent of the adults in Appalachian counties were functionally illiterate.</p>
        <p>With the new attention to literacy, groups that serve the poor are casting doubt on the social programs born in in the 1960's. The programs fed, clothed, nursed and sheltered a destitute population. But with the checks continuing until a family's children were grown, the advocates say, welfare institutionalized illiteracy and a low standard of living.</p>
        <p>''The average job here pays a little over $6'' an hour, said Richard L. Witherlite, executive director of Interfaith of Bell County Inc., a church-sponsored agency in Pineville that serves the poor. ''There's been no boom because there are no jobs. There're no jobs because people are illiterate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Witherlite said welfare supplanted coal mines that began closing and automating in the 1960's. Before that, he said: ''A boy could quit school at a young age and make a good living. Then through the generations kids thought, 'Dad made it without an education, so I can make it.' That was O.K. as long as the coal mines were here.''</p>
        <p>At the Salvation Army in Middlesboro, Capt. Edward Binnix, the commander, said he no longer helped the poor until they first went next door to the learning center of the Bell County Council on Illiteracy for testing. The illiterate need to start thinking about working on a G.E.D., he said.</p>
        <p>''We get people in here who can't fill out a job application,'' Captain Binnix said. ''We get people who don't have a first-grade education.''</p>
        <p>Still, catching up after years out of school is no easy chore. ''I finished the eighth grade,'' said Darrell Brock, 42, of Middlesboro. ''Fifteen I was. I thought I knew everything about everything. I started working, mowing lawns.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brock married and went to work for the highway department. He had two sons, now 11 and 14. But the 11-year-old is handicapped and uses a wheelchair, he said, and ''my wife died of cancer.'' She was 33. ''I quit my job,'' he said. ''I couldn't find anyone to take care of my kids.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brock's children will keep their welfare benefits, but with the changes in the system, he could soon lose his. He said he would like to get a janitorial job at his boys' school so he could be around when they needed him. For that, he most likely needs a G.E.D., and he has not yet been able to pass the test.</p>
        <p>''I can read,'' Mr. Brock said. ''I read the newspaper, the Bible, magazines, newspapers.'' But math and writing are tough. ''My weakest area is writing essays. I have to add in all that punctuation, capitalization.''</p>
        <p>In Bell County, 52 percent of the 24,000 residents 16 and older have not finished high school or earned an equivalency diploma. Just 9 percent have a bachelor's or master's degree. Twenty-eight percent fall into the first level of literacy.</p>
        <p>Bell County's unemployment rate seems low, at about 5 percent. But more than half the adults are neither working nor looking for work, compared with a third of the nation's adults. Some are disabled, some are in school, some are homemakers, and some are too illiterate to consider a job.</p>
        <p>Ron Couch, director of the state data center at the University of Louisville, said about a third of Bell County's households live in poverty, about triple the national average.</p>
        <p>''But they're not stupid,'' Wylene Payne said of the county's residents. Mr. Payne is assistant manager of Bell County's Middlesboro office of the Kentucky Department for Employment Services, where clients go to great lengths to deny their illiteracy or compensate for it. A sign at the clerk's window says job applications ''must be filled out in this office.'' The forms are not allowed to be taken out because someone other than the applicant could fill them out.</p>
        <p>''They'll say, 'I don't have my glasses today,' '' Ms. Payne said. ''I have people drawing their names.''</p>
        <p>They memorize the loops and lines of cursive script without learning the letters.</p>
        <p>Sitting in the kitchen of her rented, two-bedroom ranch house in a Middlesboro hollow, Evelyn Muncy, 54, said: ''My mother went to the fourth grade. My dad was in and out of school and went to the coal mines when he was 13. But nobody could cheat him with his money.''</p>
        <p>Now Ms. Muncy is doing as her mother did in her 40's and getting a G.E.D. She keeps a journal, written in pencil, in perfectly legible script. On the math pages of her G.E.D. workbook, she has progressed from subtracting 0 from 1 to subtracting 648 from 6,949.</p>
        <p>Donald Zimmerman, 64, has built an arsenal of coping skills. He was born in Maine and became an orphan at 10.</p>
        <p>''I stayed up in the mountains,'' sleeping in a cave, he said. ''When I needed clothes, I'd come down and take them off clotheslines.'' He stole milk and eggs that had been delivered on back porches. He took to the road. He said he could not read a map, but he did not need one. He reads the sun.</p>
        <p>Now in Middlesboro, he has earned a G.E.D. and is studying at the learning center so he can go to college. But the years of illiteracy took a toll. On a job application, he said, ''I could read the words, but I couldn't comprehend what they meant.''</p>
        <p>''I used to love to paint,'' he said. But unable to read labels, he said: ''I thought I was buying oil paint and bought a whole set of acrylics. You just can't use acrylics on top of oil.''</p>
