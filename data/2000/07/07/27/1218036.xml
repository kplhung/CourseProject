        <p>There were still a few buffaloes  roaming around the woods yesterday, but the northern New York town of Malone was managing to recover from four days in which 16 of the animals stampeded through potato, corn and dairy farms.</p>
        <p>Seven buffaloes, which had escaped from a nearby farm where they were kept as pets, were shot and killed Tuesday by United States Border Patrol agents after attempts to herd them away from a busy state highway failed.</p>
        <p>''You can't herd buffalo,'' said Mark R. Henry, assistant chief of the Border Patrol in Swanton, Vt. ''You can't direct them like cattle. These things go wherever they want to go.''</p>
        <p>The 16 buffaloes escaped Saturday from their home in Malone, a down-at-the-heels town 17 miles from the Canadian border that is home to three state prisons and miles of rolling farmland.</p>
        <p>When Maria Byrnes, the woman who raised the animals, realized she could not coax them back home, she called a buffalo farmer from nearby St. Lawrence County and offered to sell him her pets if he would round them up, said Trooper Bernie Perry of the state police.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday morning, the farmer, John A. Putnam, shot and killed the herd's two bulls, thinking it would be easier to corral the buffalo cows if the males were no longer leading them astray. He managed to load another five into a truck, but then the remaining nine took off, following a female, Agent Henry said.</p>
        <p>But 1,500-pound animals cannot hide for long. Later that morning, half a dozen came charging across the fields of a dairy farm, about two miles down the wooded road from where they had last been seen. About a dozen of the farm's dairy cows were trotting behind.</p>
        <p>A farmhand raking and baling hay was startled to see the stampede heading toward his tractor. He ran into the farmhouse, where the farmer, James Tavernier, 58, had just sat down for a cup of coffee.</p>
        <p>The farmhand ''come flying in.''</p>
        <p>''Said, 'Buffalo!' '' Mr. Tavernier told The Press-Republican, a daily newspaper that covers the Plattsburgh area.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tavernier, afraid the buffaloes would charge through his fence and lead his entire herd of dairy cows onto State Route 11, called the police, then got into his truck, drove toward the animals and tried to herd them into another field. Instead, he scared them back into the woods.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to corral buffalo,'' Trooper Perry said. ''I've seen them walk through three strands of barbed wire like it was cobwebs.''</p>
        <p>By midafternoon, six buffaloes  had been shot as they came out into the hay fields. Later that day, a seventh was killed. Their carcasses were taken to a meat rendering plant to be used in dog food.</p>
        <p>Two buffaloes are still at large,  roaming around in the woods,  Agent Henry said.</p>
        <p>''I was sorry we had to shoot them,'' said the agent, whose co-workers are more accustomed to patrolling the border with Canada and keeping out contraband than riding herd on buffalo. ''We discussed tranquilizing them, but we thought they'd go into the woods. How do you get a 1,500-pound animal out of the woods into a truck?''</p>
        <p>A buffalo stampede is unusual in these parts, but not unheard of.</p>
        <p>''In June '97, we had the same thing, some buffalo got loose,'' Agent Henry said. ''A tractor-trailer hit a buffalo, and it tore that tractor-trailer right up.''</p>
