        <p>New York City plans to hand over control of some of its worst-performing public schools to private companies or nonprofit agencies in the fall of 2001, the first such effort in the city's history and one of the largest programs to privatize education in the country.</p>

        <p>New York City plans to hand over control of some of its worst-performing public schools to private companies or nonprofit agencies in the fall of 2001, the first such effort in the city's history and one of the largest programs to privatize education in the country.</p>
        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy issued a request yesterday for proposals to help the Board of Education convert the failing institutions into charter schools, freeing them from many of the state and local regulations that now govern them. If the schools' conversions to charter status are approved by the State Board of Regents, the school's new managers will be able to renegotiate some union contracts.</p>
        <p>The plan, as outlined by Mr. Levy, did not specify how many or which schools would be converted and turned over to private management. But Board of Education officials said that the program was likely to focus on 5 to 7 schools and could include as many as 20 schools in its first year depending on the number and quality of applications the board received.</p>
        <p>There are roughly 50 New York City schools -- 80 percent of them elementary and middle schools and the rest high schools -- that are eligible for the program. They are both on the state's list of ''schools under registration review'' because of their poor performance and part of the Chancellor's District, the special school district that the Board of Education established for struggling schools.</p>
        <p>The program is a victory for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has pushed for the privatization of parts of the city's educational services and who has feuded with two previous schools chancellors over nontraditional approaches to education. This year, he set aside $60.8 million of the Board of Education's $11 billion budget to pay for private management of some of the worst-performing city schools.</p>
        <p>The plan does not require a board vote, but board officials said Mr. Levy discussed it with each board member and received their approvals to go ahead. The plan is also likely to find favor with the Regents, who have been pushing for improvements in New York City's worst schools.</p>
        <p>Anthony P. Coles, deputy mayor for planning, education and cultural affairs, said the plan ''should give the parents whose children have been trapped in failing schools some real hope.''</p>
        <p>''It's clear that new management is needed in these schools, and this is an important first step,'' Mr. Coles said. ''The board and the chancellor deserve congratulations.''</p>
        <p>Far less happy was Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, which represents the city's 78,000 teachers and which could lose influence in the schools run by outsiders. She cautioned that the plan looked like ''a political diversion,'' and said there was no evidence that privatization of education worked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy came to the chancellor's post from the business world with no formal background in education management and was seen as having close links to the teachers' union. Nonetheless, he has so far avoided the ideological confrontations with City Hall that weakened previous chancellors. Yesterday, he said he was ''cautiously optimistic that this effort will yield positive results for some of our poorest-performing schools.''</p>
        <p>Noting that ''many people have placed a great deal of hope'' in privatization, Mr. Levy added, ''Under the right circumstances, privatization can be a useful tool in improving performance, but it is not a magic bullet.''</p>
        <p>Such experiments have failed miserably in some cities, particularly Baltimore and Hartford, Conn., which several years ago each hired a for-profit company to run the public schools. The efforts did not produce the desired results, and the two cities retook control of the schools.</p>
        <p>Other, more limited efforts, where private companies have managed a few schools in a larger district, have proved workable. But studies of their effectiveness have found mixed results.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the Board of Education's announcement yesterday, which Mr. Levy had hinted at for months, drew praise from business and political leaders and cautious optimism from people within the school system.</p>
        <p>Robert R. Kiley, president of the New York City Partnership, a group of civic and business leaders that has pushed for education reform, said the plan ''is a great door swung open that to this point has pretty much been closed.''</p>
        <p>''The Board of Education is not known for staying the course on things like this, or even really meaning it when they start something,'' said Mr. Kiley, who was Mr. Giuliani's choice to replace Rudy Crew as schools chancellor earlier this year. ''They will have to show a real credibility in this process to attract the right companies and nonprofits. That includes a real strategy not just to change one or two schools but to show how this initial foray can be converted over time to deal with a lot of other schools as well.''</p>
        <p>Under the program, companies or nonprofit organizations with a demonstrated record of managing schools have until Aug. 18 to present a proposal to guide a school through three phases of the conversion process. Because state law requires that the parents of 51 percent of a school's students vote for conversion to a charter school, the first phase must include a plan for informing the community. After that, a proposal should focus on a business and educational plan for the school and, in the final phase, policies for admissions and the hiring of staff.</p>
        <p>Under state law, a school that converts to charter status must continue to employ any staff members who want to continue working there under existing union contracts. But because low-performing schools in New York City have very high turnover rates, a new management company would probably be able to hire large numbers of new teachers and other staff members. A converted school is also required to keep any students who want to continue there as well as enroll students from its local district before opening admissions to broader student populations.</p>
        <p>The management company would receive a per-student payment from the Board of Education to operate the school. State law requires an allocation of only about $6,630 per student, not including money for federal benefits and other special programs. But David Klasfeld, deputy chancellor for operations, said the board intended ''to treat these schools the same as every other school in the Chancellor's District,'' which last year spent more than $10,000 per student.</p>
        <p>New York City has already made an effort to embrace charter schools, with seven charters that have converted from public schools scheduled to be operating this fall, plus eight charter schools that have started from scratch in the last two years.</p>
        <p>Some large districts, like Dallas and Wichita, Kan., have turned over some of their schools to private managers, and some smaller districts like Inkster, Mich., have contracted for outsiders to run the entire district, but New York's plan is likely to involve more students and schools than most existing programs.</p>
        <p>Steven Klinsky, president of Victory Schools Inc., which opened one charter school in Harlem last year and is opening another in Queens in September, said the advantage of converting a school to charter status was that the building -- often one of the hardest parts to come by -- was already in place. He said Victory hoped to take part in the new program. So, too, does Edison Schools, the largest for-profit school management company in the country, said Benno C. Schmidt Jr., Edison's chairman.</p>
