        <p>In their brief joint appearance on Tuesday, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney both mentioned Social Security first when they referred to some of the big issues facing the country. Both said that strengthening the Social Security system was a priority.</p>
        <p>And yet a rigorous analysis by the nonpartisan Century Foundation of Mr. Bush's proposal to allow workers to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes in personal retirement accounts has determined that the plan would either worsen the system's long-term deficit or lead to substantial cuts in Social Security benefits, or both.</p>
        <p>The analysis of Mr. Bush's plan was conducted by Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; Alan Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton University and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; Alicia Munnell of Boston College; and Peter Orszag, president of Sebago Associates, an economics and public policy consulting firm.</p>
        <p>It is understood that diverting revenue from the Social Security system to individual accounts, by itself, increases the system's projected deficit. The study said: ''Compensating for this lost revenue and addressing Social Security's long-term deficit will require some combination of: higher payroll taxes; investing part of the Social Security trust funds in higher-yielding assets (such as stocks); general revenue transfers to Social Security; and/or reductions in Social Security benefits.''</p>
        <p>The authors went on: ''Governor Bush has promised not to raise payroll taxes or invest the trust fund in stocks. He also has proposed tax cuts that would consume virtually the entire projected non-Social Security surplus, leaving no room for transfers to Social Security without causing a non-Social Security deficit. Governor Bush's plan would therefore have to rely on cutting Social Security benefits.''</p>
        <p>The study attempted to determine whether the proceeds from the individual retirement accounts would be enough to offset the benefit cuts. It came to conclusions that were frightening.</p>
        <p>The authors based their analysis on a diversion of two percentage points of the current Social Security payroll tax into individual retirement accounts. And they assumed an inflation-adjusted rate of return on the accounts of 5.9 percent annually, which matched the assumption of Martin Feldstein, an advocate of retirement accounts and a top adviser to Governor Bush.</p>
        <p>After extensive analysis, they concluded that substantial cuts in guaranteed benefits for workers 55 and under were inevitable.</p>
        <p>''Social Security benefits for 30-year-olds would have to be reduced by 54 percent to extend the solvency of the Social Security system for the next 75 years,'' the study said. ''Even if the stock market performs as well as it has historically, the combined income from the individual account and the scaled-back Social Security system would be 20 percent below current-law Social Security benefits for the average 30-year-old single earner.''</p>
        <p>That's what would happen if the stocks purchased by this hypothetical 30-year-old did well. But, of course, they might not.</p>
        <p>''The conclusion,'' the authors wrote, ''is that Governor Bush's proposal could cut Social Security benefits by more than 50 percent for young workers, and the proceeds from the individual accounts would (on average) make up only a portion of that cut while exposing individuals to significant risk.''</p>
        <p>Believe it or not, that's the rosier scenario.</p>
        <p>The study said: ''These estimates are based on assumptions we believe understate the likely reductions in Social Security benefits. Even with these favorable assumptions, the results are dramatic: Governor Bush's plan requires substantial reductions in Social Security benefits and increased exposure to market risks for future retirees. Indeed, the implied reductions in Social Security benefits for future retirees are so substantial, they raise questions about the viability of protecting benefits for current retirees, older workers, disabled workers, and survivors while diverting payroll taxes into individual accounts.''</p>
        <p>Governor Bush and Mr. Cheney will be rigorously cross-examined on this matter between now and November.</p>
