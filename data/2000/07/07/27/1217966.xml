        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a filmmaker who has tried to record Manhattan at its most beautiful and charming, I would like to stand behind the position taken by some Greenwich Village residents against New York University's plan to put up a 13-story building on West Third Street, destroying two historic structures, including a house where Edgar Allan Poe once lived (letter, July 25).</p>
        <p>There is no question that much of Greenwich Village is New York at its loveliest, and the trick over the years in filming around Washington Square has been to show the world the magic of the great-looking preserved areas while framing out the construction done by N.Y.U.</p>

        <p>As a filmmaker who has tried to record Manhattan at its most beautiful and charming, I would like to stand behind the position taken by some Greenwich Village residents against New York University's plan to put up a 13-story building on West Third Street, destroying two historic structures, including a house where Edgar Allan Poe once lived (letter, July 25).</p>
        <p>There is no question that much of Greenwich Village is New York at its loveliest, and the trick over the years in filming around Washington Square has been to show the world the magic of the great-looking preserved areas while framing out the construction done by N.Y.U.</p>
        <p>No one is questioning the need for the university's law school to expand, but surely it can be worked out in a way that does not destroy yet another piece of this fast-vanishing area.</p>
        <p>It is hard for me to believe that a great institution like N.Y.U., which had the foresight and good taste to expel me many years ago, would be insensitive to this situation.</p>
