        <p>DEMOCRATS DRILL FOR OIL -- No sooner had Dick Cheney been selected as Gov. George W. Bush's running mate than the Democratic National Committee put up a Web site, www.bush-cheney.net, as a parody of the team. With a graphic of an oil well gushing dollars, the Web site says the two men are ''covered with money from Big Oil'' and features statements that Mr. Cheney's Congressional voting record is more conservative than that of Jesse Helms. A committee spokesman said the site went up minutes after Mr. Cheney's selection was announced and, so far, it has received more than 15,000 hits. The Bush campaign, which has acquired a large number of domain names to prevent parody sites, had apparently never purchased the Bush-Cheney combination. ''We like to think of our site as like 'Dragnet','' said the committee spokesman, ''It's just the facts, ma'am.''</p>

        <p>THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>THE NEWEST REPUBLICAN -- Representative Matthew G. Martinez of California became the latest party-switcher in the House yesterday in a year marked by two other defections, one to each side. Mr. Martinez, who was trounced in his Democratic primary earlier this year, announced he was becoming a Republican, saying he was disappointed that Democratic leaders did not do more to help him win re-election. With his defection, Republicans hold a 223-to-210 advantage over Democrats in the House, not including two independents. After 18 years in the House, Mr. Martinez was defeated by Hilda Solis, a state senator, who portrayed him as out of touch with his district. Since his primary defeat, Mr. Martinez, 71, has been siding with Republicans, even on close votes like a Republican-sponsored prescription drug plan, which passed by three votes. ''Voters in this country won't forget in November how the Democratic leadership has treated them for the last two years,'' Representative J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the speaker of the House, said.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>KEYES BACKS BUSH TICKET -- He did not win a single presidential primary or caucus, but Alan Keyes, the hard-right radio talk show host, stayed on the campaign trail long after it was certain that Gov. George W. Bush was going to be the Republican nominee. Winning or losing was not as important to him, he insisted, as spreading his message that the nation must rededicate itself to moral principles and especially to outlawing abortion. But late Tuesday in Boston, Mr. Keyes, the only black candidate in the 2000 presidential field, pulled out of the race. Asked if he still considered himself a candidate with just a week to go before Mr. Bush is formally nominated in Philadelphia, he replied: ''I am not.'' He said he would back the Bush-Cheney ticket, noting that Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, were strong opponents of abortion.</p>

        <p>PRIMARY PLAN PASSES RULES COMMITTEE -- The Republican Party moved a step closer yesterday to adopting a presidential nomination plan in which small states would vote first and big states last. The rules committee of the Republican National Committee, which adopted the proposal in May, reaffirmed its support of the plan, which was intended to forestall a drift to a national primary, encourage more candidates to stay in the race longer and ensure that more votes matter than did this year, when the nominations were settled in early March. The full national committee will vote on Thursday. The most serious opposition is expected on Friday when the national convention's rules committee takes up the proposal. Big states that fear irrelevance from coming last, and traditional opponents of giving the Republican National Committee more power, which would be required to implement the plan, are joining to fight it there.</p>

        <p>THE MONEY RACE</p>
        <p>KEEPING AN EYE OUT FOR LOOPHOLES -- The sponsors of new legislation requiring financial disclosure by secretive political fund-raising committees are worried that politicians have already found a way around the new law. Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, and John McCain, Republican of Arizona, have written to the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service to make clear that they intended the new law to cover the fund-raising activities of all political action committees. The issue arose because some lawyers suggested that the new law, intended to require financial disclosure from so-called Section 527 groups, named for a provision in the tax code, might not apply to committees that raised both hard and soft money. Hard money can be used for any political purpose; soft money cannot be used to advocate the election or defeat of a specific candidate. The lawyers said the law might not cover so-called leadership PACs, which are fund-raising vehicles formed by Congressional leaders. The letters were signed by 17 senators and 4 House members.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>GORE AHEAD IN NEW JERSEY -- In New Jersey, which both parties view as a crucial electoral battleground, Vice President Al Gore continues to hold a slight lead over Gov. George W. Bush, according to the latest Quinnipiac  University poll. The survey of 910 registered voters taken July 19-24, with a margin of sampling error of three percentage points, shows Mr. Gore with a lead of 46 percent to 41 percent in a one-on-one race. When small-party candidates are included, Mr. Gore's lead is 42-38 over Mr. Bush, with 7 percent for Ralph Nader and 2 percent for Patrick J. Buchanan. The survey was taken before Mr. Bush's choice of Dick Cheney, who opposes abortion, as his running mate, but the poll suggested that choosing a vice presidential candidate who favored abortion rights would have done little to help Mr. Bush in New Jersey: 15 percent said they would have been more likely to vote Republican, 15 percent less likely, and 66 percent said it would have made no difference.</p>
