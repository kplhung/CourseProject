        <p>One of the four police officers who shot Amadou Diallo has been cleared of wrongdoing in another fatal shooting, prompting that man's father to denounce the judicial process yesterday.</p>
        <p>The parents of the second victim, Patrick Bailey, a 22-year-old black man from Brooklyn who was killed in 1997 by Officer Kenneth Boss, had sued four police officers and the City of New York for $2.5 million for their roles in Mr. Bailey's death. The trial began in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on July 17, and the jury cleared the defendants of any wrongdoing on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''I know my son was murdered by Kenneth Boss,'' Lloyd Bailey, the father of the slain man, said at a news conference yesterday. But, he said, after Officer Boss and three others were acquitted in Mr. Diallo's death, ''I figured it would be slim justice for us.''</p>
        <p>''For the jury to go out with five whites, one Latino and two blacks and come back with a verdict in less than two hours was a gross miscarriage of justice,'' he said. ''We are outraged, but once again, justice does not work for black people in this country.''</p>
        <p>Gail Donaghue, a city lawyer, said  she ''was pleased that a jury was able to overcome a lot of public sentiment and feelings and doubts about police officers that may be out there and sort out the facts of a particular case in a very careful way.''</p>
        <p>On Feb. 25, a jury in Albany acquitted the four white officers of criminal wrongdoing in the death of Mr. Diallo, a Guinean street vendor who was shot at 41 times in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building last year. The officers said they mistook a black wallet that Mr. Diallo was holding for a gun.</p>
        <p>In the killing of Mr. Bailey, Officer Boss said he opened fire after the young man raised a sawed-off shotgun in a hallway. The officer was one of four who had gone into Mr. Bailey's apartment building in East New York to investigate a complaint that Mr. Bailey had threatened a neighbor with a shotgun. Last year, the Brooklyn district attorney's office decided that Officer Boss had acted properly and chose not to prosecute him.</p>
        <p>In the civil trial, lawyers for Mr. Bailey's family tried to prove through witnesses that the dead man had not been holding a shotgun.</p>
        <p>Lloyd Bailey said he planned to appeal the verdict and would ask the United States Justice Department to open a federal grand jury investigation into what he called civil rights violations in the shooting.</p>
