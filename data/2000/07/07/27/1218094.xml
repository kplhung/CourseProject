        <p>Wilbur L. Chapman, the city's transportation commissioner and one of the few high-ranking black officials in the Giuliani administration, is resigning to become the police commissioner of Bridgeport, Conn., officials in that city said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chapman, 52, took over the Transportation Department -- the agency in charge of New York's streets, highways, parking and traffic signals, as well as some bridges and ferries -- after spending almost 30 years in the Police Department, eventually rising to chief of patrol, the department's largest bureau, in 1995.</p>

        <p>Wilbur L. Chapman, the city's transportation commissioner and one of the few high-ranking black officials in the Giuliani administration, is resigning to become the police commissioner of Bridgeport, Conn., officials in that city said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chapman, 52, took over the Transportation Department -- the agency in charge of New York's streets, highways, parking and traffic signals, as well as some bridges and ferries -- after spending almost 30 years in the Police Department, eventually rising to chief of patrol, the department's largest bureau, in 1995.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Chapman nor other city officials would confirm his departure, first reported yesterday in The Daily News. But Joseph Gresko, a spokesman for Mayor Joseph P. Ganim of Bridgeport, said Mr. Chapman had accepted the job and would probably begin around the first of September. Mr. Gresko said the appointment would be announced at a news conference in Bridgeport today.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was among those who would not comment yesterday about whether Mr. Chapman was leaving, was asked by reporters yesterday whether he was concerned about top black officials leaving his administration. Richard T. Roberts, the head of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, announced earlier this month that he was resigning to take a job at Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment firm. Teresa Mason, the city sheriff, resigned in June to take a job with a bank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said the resignations were not part of any pattern and did not worry him. ''That is a created issue, an absolutely created issue,'' he said. ''It comes from looking at the world through glasses in which you see people as white, black, different ethnic, religious or racial groups.''</p>
        <p>During Mr. Chapman's two years heading the Department of Transportation, he was criticized by advocates for improved transportation as frequently not showing up at important meetings and as failing to show leadership on issues like growing traffic congestion, pedestrian safety and the poor condition of New York City streets. ''He came into an agency in flux and he is leaving an agency in flux,'' said John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a watchdog group.</p>
        <p>Asked about the criticisms yesterday, Mark Patterson, a Transportation Department spokesman, said Mr. Chapman would not comment.</p>
