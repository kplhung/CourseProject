        <p>DURING Prohibition, Americans rowed across the Detroit River to this border city to buy whisky. A generation later, young people drove across the river to buy marijuana. But today, the border contraband run is to score a different kind of Canadian pot, one that gives a different kind of thrill -- the forbidden flush.</p>
        <p>''Why do I need the government to tell me what kind of toilet to buy?'' Linda Walton, a visiting American, asked one hot Saturday morning after her husband, Tony, wrestled three 3.5-gallon-capacity toilets into their van.</p>
        <p>The Waltons and their two boys, Kyle and Ian, had made the five-and-a-half-hour road trip from Indianapolis in search of suburbia's new holy grail: the kind of old-style, big-flush toilet that Americans took as their birthright until 1994. That year, a federal water conservation law went into effect, mandating that all new toilets use only 1.6 gallons a flush.</p>
        <p>Border towns from New Brunswick to British Columbia now offer what one Vancouver plumber has called Canuck commodes. One of the most popular destinations is Windsor's Veteran Plumbing and Supplies, conveniently located only two blocks from the mouth of the tunnel from Detroit.</p>
        <p>There, on any given Saturday, knots of Americans can be found inspecting a gleaming array of 3.5's in seafoam green, Bahama pink, Jamaican beige, Tiffany rose and the safe decorating standby, bone white. Some potties even carry the sticker ''For Export from the U.S. Only.''</p>
        <p>Under the new law, conviction for distribution and sale of taboo toilets inside the United States can mean fines of $100 a toilet. But if American toilet manufacturers, like American Standard, Mansfield, Kohler and Eljer, may now make jumbo toilets only for export, there is no law to stop Americans from driving them back across the border. And thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement, if the toilets are made in the United States or Canada, they come in duty-free.</p>
        <p>Kurt Sutts, the new owner of Veteran Plumbing, winces at hearing the word ''contraband.'' Suavely dressed in Top-Siders, shorts, polo shirt and gold chains, he said confidently, ''It is legal for Americans to bring them back.''</p>
        <p>Once home, Americans face the hurdle that new houses will not pass inspections if they are outfitted with old-style big flushers. But with inspections behind them, some Americans indulge in a new, closed-door suburban passion: toilet swapping.</p>
        <p>''We have people building million-dollar houses, but they come in here to buy an old toilet,'' Tim Harmon, the owner of Tim &amp; Billy's Salvage Store in Indianapolis, said in a telephone interview. ''Nobody wants those new toilets. We sell maybe 10 or 20 old toilets a week.''</p>
        <p>''Everybody complains about the new ones,'' Mr. Harmon continued. ''The biggest argument that you hear is that you have to flush it two or three times to get all the waste down, so who's saving water?''</p>
        <p>Mario Muglia, a Michigan home builder who is a regular shopper here, estimated that a quarter of his clients insist on old-style toilets. ''A lot of people are just used to the big flush,'' he said. In a 1998 membership survey by the National Association of Homebuilders, 72 percent of respondents said that the new toilets were a problem.</p>
        <p>Advocates of low-flush toilets respond that the newer models work better than early versions. In a recent study, Consumer Reports said that the late 1990's models ''worked just fine almost always on one flush.''</p>
        <p>Advocates also calculate that the 50 million low-flush toilets installed since 1994 save 500 million gallons of water daily, cutting the cost of expanded water supply and sewage disposal. Toilets, they estimate, can account for a quarter of household water use. Ed Osann, a natural resources consultant who lobbied almost a decade ago for the conservation legislation, said: ''The argument for water efficiency is pretty clear. We face growing demands for water and wastewater infrastructure investment in the United States.''</p>
        <p>Many critics of water savers are  politically conservative to begin with. And when they kneel, plunger in hand, before a clogged, low-flow toilet, they start thinking negative thoughts about Washington: ''First, our toilets; next, our handguns,'' they mutter, and, ''If liberals are so eager to get big government out of the bedroom, why are they so eager to put big government in the bathroom?''</p>
        <p>''It's just another government intrusion into what I do and say,'' Mr. Walton said. ''If they spent as much time regulating their nuclear secrets at Los Alamos as they do regulating toilets, our secrets would be safe.''</p>
        <p>G. Gordon Liddy, who won notoriety for working with a different  breed of plumber during Watergate, boasted on his radio show that he traveled overseas to buy banned toilets for his new house. In one of many blasts against so-called toilet totalitarianism, he warned: ''Next, the government will require us to wear helmets in the shower, lest we slip and fall.''</p>
        <p>Some may tag Mr. Liddy a toilet reactionary. But United States Representative Joe Knollenberg, a Republican from an affluent Detroit suburb, is sponsoring legislation to restore toilet choice. The congressman assails Washington for imposing a one-size-fits-all toilet on the entire nation. Much the way national speed limits ignored the geographic differences between Montana and Massachusetts, his supporters say, the national toilet standard ignores differences between water-rich states like Michigan and Minnesota, and water-poor states like Arizona and California.</p>
        <p>''People were none too happy with the commodes they were forced to use,'' Paul Welday, the congressman's chief of staff, said. ''We found that we had a number of constituents who were crossing the bridge to get those toilets.''</p>
        <p>Noting that the bill has attracted support from voters nationwide and from members of Congress of both parties, he said, ''They're just folks from all across the country who have literally written in on the back of toilet paper to say, 'Keep up the good work.' ''</p>
