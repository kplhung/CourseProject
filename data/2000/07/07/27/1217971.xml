        <p>In the city that never sleeps, it can sometimes be difficult to decide what to do. Vindigo, a ''personal navigation'' program for Palm and Handspring Visor electronic organizers, can be considered a digital replacement for the entertainment listings in the newspaper or weekly city magazine -- with a little something extra.</p>
        <p>Vindigo, which is available free for download from www.vindigo.com, made its debut in March. Recently the company announced a Macintosh version of the program. The new application will work on computers running version 8.0 or higher of the Mac operating system. The PC version of Vindigo can also be found on the Web site and will work on systems running Windows 95 or later. In addition to New York, Vindigo offers city guides for Chicago, Washington, San Francisco and Boston.</p>

        <p>Vindigo, which is available free for download from www.vindigo.com, made its debut in March. Recently the company announced a Macintosh version of the program.

In addition to New York, Vindigo offers city guides for Chicago, Washington, San Francisco and Boston.</p>
        <p>Users get more than just movie times, a shopping directory and current nightlife events and restaurant reviews from Zagat.com and NYToday.com (which is owned by New York Times Digital, a division of The New York Times Company). The Vindigo program will also give walking directions from any starting point. . For example, if you are looking to catch a screening of the new ''X-Men'' movie, Vindigo will tell you the show times and nearest movie houses showing the film. The program will also give you a plot synopsis, the running time of the film, who's starring in it and how to get there. Users received updated information and listings from the Vindigo server when synchronizing the Palm or Visor organizer with a computer connected to the Internet.</p>
        <p>The program, which features tiny advertisements sprinkled throughout the listings, needs a minimum of 410 kilobytes of free space on the handheld device. Although that may be a significant chunk of memory for some handhelds, it still may be preferable to hauling around the old clunky tree-based media for directions to a fine night on the town. And just think, no more ink smears on your nice clothes.</p>
