        <p>New York Giants rookie linebacker Dhani Jones to miss season after suffering anterior cruciate ligament tear in his left knee (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Giants' promising rookie linebacker, Dhani Jones, a sixth-round draft choice from the University of Michigan who was having a spectacular training camp, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee today in a special teams drill and is out for the season.</p>
        <p>While a team normally does not get flustered when a rookie late-round pick is injured, the Giants were upset because Jones showed such promise. Coach Jim Fassel said that Jones would use the next two to three weeks to strengthen his knee before having surgery.</p>

        <p>Jones, who was unavailable for comment, was running downfield at about three-quarters speed when his knee buckled and he collapsed.</p>
        <p>Running back Joe Montgomery missed practice because his blood pressure was unusually high. The team cleared Montgomery to practice on Thursday.</p>
