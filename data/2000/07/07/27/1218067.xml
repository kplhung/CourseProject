        <p>A scout for the San Diego Padres is tracking the Yankees' Class AAA affiliate Columbus as possible preparation for a swap of highly touted young players, a deal that could lead to greater things for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>The Padres are watching Alfonso Soriano, according to a minor league official, and in the last two days Soriano was shifted from second base to shortstop for the express purpose of auditioning for San Diego. The Yankees apparently are interested in making a trade for Matt Clement, a hard-throwing sinkerballer who is currently 9-9 with a 5.14 earned run average for the Padres.</p>

        <p>A scout for the San Diego Padres is tracking the Yankees' Class AAA affiliate Columbus as possible preparation for a swap of highly touted young players, a deal that could lead to greater things for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>The Padres are watching Alfonso Soriano, according to a minor league official, and in the last two days Soriano was shifted from second base to shortstop for the express purpose of auditioning for San Diego. The Yankees apparently are interested in making a trade for Matt Clement, a hard-throwing sinkerballer who is currently 9-9 with a 5.14 earned run average for the Padres.</p>
        <p>Clement, who turns 26 in a couple of weeks, would give the Yankees more depth in their staff and allow them to trade Ramiro Mendoza for another hitter, such as Cleveland's Richie Sexson.</p>
        <p>B. J. Surhoff remains the first choice of some members of the Yankees' organization as they search for a left fielder before the July 31 trading deadline. But the Surhoff talks with the Orioles are on the verge of falling apart after conversations between the teams today.</p>
        <p>The Yankees opened recent negotiations for Surhoff by offering Dave Walling, a Class AA pitcher who was a No. 1 draft pick in 1999, and another prospect to be drawn from a list of three. Syd Thrift, the Orioles' general manager, poked fun at the Yankees' offer Tuesday, suggesting it smelled ''like limburger cheese.'' Today Thrift asked the Yankees about the availability of D'Angelo Jimenez, the shortstop who suffered a broken bone in his neck in an off-season car accident and, coincidentally, played in his first minor league rehab game today in Florida.</p>
        <p>Thrift was told that Jimenez may not be available but that if he is part of the deal then Walling would not be. That is probably unacceptable to the Orioles.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have a handful of other options, including a trade of  Soriano to the Expos for Rondell White. At least two members of the Montreal organization are said to be pushing to make that trade immediately, rather than waiting and risking the possibility that the Yankees will swap for a player from another team.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have also considered the likes of Philadelphia's Ron Gant.</p>
        <p>Coach and Team Weigh Options</p>
        <p>When the Yankees' pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre, disclosed in April that he had cancer of the bone marrow, he said flatly that he did not want his illness to become an issue and that he did not want to be treated differently by the players or the news media.</p>
        <p>He has gone about his work in the same steadfast manner, with his same perpetual good nature, even on the days when he receives chemotherapy. Stottlemyre said in April that there will probably be a time late this season when he will have to leave the team for more intensive treatment. At some point in the weeks ahead, General Manager Brian Cashman understands, Stottlemyre may come to him and tell him when he needs to leave the team.</p>
        <p>''I've respected his situation and I'm waiting for him to tell me,'' Cashman said today. ''He's going to miss a period of time late in the season. He said that was the range -- late in the season -- and I don't know if that's the range now.''</p>
        <p>Billy Connors, the organization's pitching coordinator, could fill in while Stottlemyre is away, for Connors is most familiar with the Yankee pitchers, having worked with just about all of them.</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre said in April that he would no longer discuss his illness and that he just wanted to go about coaching pitchers. ''It's pretty important for me to continue to work, something that I enjoy doing, something I enjoy being around, for my state of mind,'' he said in April. ''It's real important.''</p>
        <p>The Injury Report</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' second baseman, was found to have a strained muscle in the vicinity of his right elbow after being examined through an M.R.I. and an X-ray today in New York. Knoblauch rejoined the Yankees this evening.</p>
        <p>Ramiro Mendoza played catch and felt fine, and Manager Joe Torre said Mendoza would be activated before Friday's game against the Twins, barring any setbacks.</p>
        <p>Torre has said that Mendoza will pitch in middle relief, which should reduce the burden on the other members of the bullpen.</p>
        <p>Orlando Hernandez threw 35 pitches off a mound in Tampa, Fla., today, and assuming he does not experience any recurring elbow trouble, he will intensify his throwing program in the next week and could be about two weeks away from moving back into the Yankees' rotation.</p>
