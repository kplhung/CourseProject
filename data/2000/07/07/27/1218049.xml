        <p>Four years after helping to win the Persian Gulf war and liberating the oil fields of Kuwait, former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney went from fighting for oil to running a Dallas-based business that he has helped transform into the world's largest oil field services company.</p>
        <p>As chief executive of the Halliburton Company since 1995, Mr. Cheney has been able to rely heavily on the high-level contacts in the Middle East he made as defense secretary to win business in the roughneck world of international oil.</p>
        <p>And now, as he re-emerges from the business world to become the running mate of the presumed Republican presidential nominee, George W. Bush, Mr. Cheney's corporate experience has made clear the Republican ticket's roots in the oil industry.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Cheney joined the company in 1995, his background as a leader in the gulf war has seemed tailor-made for Halliburton, because much of its business is done with Arab governments. Almost 70 percent of Halliburton's nearly $15 billion in annual sales come from overseas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney quickly established himself as Halliburton's outside man, a globe-trotting rainmaker, while his deputy and now successor, David Lesar, handled internal operations.</p>
        <p>''Cheney could go to the Middle East, he had a reputation there, and most C.E.O.'s don't have that,'' said David Gribbin, a longtime friend of Mr. Cheney who now serves as Halliburton's vice president of government affairs in Washington.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Adelman, a former Reagan administration official and longtime Cheney friend, agreed that ''Halliburton played to his strengths, which were contacts in the Arab world and dealing with governments.''</p>
        <p>Under his leadership, the value of the company's stock has fluctuated dramatically. In August 1995, when he arrived, it was trading at around $21 a share. Within two years, the value had nearly tripled. But more recently it has fallen back, closing today at 43 9/16 .</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney was a surprise choice when he was named chief executive of Halliburton, since he had virtually no experience in the business world and had not held a full-time job since leaving the Pentagon. In 1993 and 1994, Mr. Cheney had spent his time giving speeches, joining corporate boards, and campaigning for Republican candidates while he decided whether to run for president himself.</p>
        <p>But by early 1995, Mr. Cheney had decided against a presidential bid, and began considering his next move. The business world, largely unknown to Mr. Cheney, became ''a more attractive option after he gave up on running for president,'' recalled Sean O'Keefe, who was secretary of the Navy in the Bush Administration and remains close to Mr. Cheney.</p>
        <p>The opportunity came in the kind of power-networking event that is so typical in corporate America today: a fly-fishing trip with Halliburton's chairman, Thomas Cruikshank, who came away impressed.</p>
        <p>Later, after Mr. Cruikshank decided to retire and was disenchanted with the list of his possible successors drawn up by a Halliburton search committee, he began pushing Mr. Cheney for the job.</p>
        <p>''There was instant backing for Dick when his name was brought to our attention,'' said Anne Armstrong, ambassador to Britain in the Ford administration and then a Halliburton board member.</p>
        <p>Several friends and business associates said they did not know of any role former President George Bush played in helping Mr. Cheney obtain the post at Halliburton.</p>
        <p>Roger Staubach, the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback who was a member of Halliburton's board at the time of the selection, said Mr. Cheney's health and his history of heart problems were ''not an issue anyone worried about,'' although it was ''brought up in passing'' by the board.</p>
        <p>Appointed chief executive of Halliburton in August 1995, Mr. Cheney took over a company that analysts said was trying to adapt to big changes in the oil industry, including a collapse in oil prices in the late 1990's that dampened exploration.</p>
        <p>With more than 100,000 employees, Halliburton's main business is to provide oil producers with the technology and equipment to find, drill for, and pump oil out of the ground, including everything from sophisticated computer software that helps locate underground oil fields to drill bits and pressure pumping systems.</p>
        <p>Its customers include the world's largest oil producers as well as oil-producing nations. It also has large engineering and construction businesses, and has pursued other lines of business, like construction work for the United States military abroad, including logistical support to American forces in the Balkans.</p>
        <p>Since arriving at Halliburton, Mr. Cheney has sprinkled the company with a few longtime, loyal aides. Mr. Gribbin, a high school friend from Wyoming who worked for Mr. Cheney in Congress and at the Pentagon, is now vice president of government affairs in Halliburton's Washington office.</p>
        <p>Joe Lopez, a retired admiral who was Mr. Cheney's military aide while he was secretary of defense, is now chief operating officer of Brown &amp; Root Services, a Halliburton subsidiary that has government contracts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's most important move at Halliburton was to orchestrate the 1998 acquisition of one of its largest competitors, Dresser Industries. Overnight, the merger made Halliburton the world's largest oil services company.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Staubach, the company had kicked around the idea of buying Dresser before Mr. Cheney's arrival, but ''he definitely reignited it,'' bringing it back as ''a real opportunity when he was C.E.O.''</p>
        <p>Still, the Dresser deal has received mixed reviews from industry analysts. The merger took place when oil producers, Halliburton's main customers, were facing declining oil prices and were trimming spending.</p>
        <p>''They had what then seemed to be a brilliant deal with the merger of Dresser, which made a lot of sense in a lot of ways,'' said Arvind S. Sanger, an industry analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. But ''the cycle turned down viciously for the oil services group.''</p>
        <p>Like other big oil companies, Halliburton does business in some of the third world's roughest areas, providing oil services in the Caspian region in Central Asia, the North Sea, offshore fields in West Africa, the Middle East, Venezuela and now Bangladesh.</p>
        <p>Since taking over the company, Mr. Cheney has sharply increased the company's reliance on international operations. Since 1994, the year before he became chief executive, the percentage of Halliburton's revenues from domestic operations fell to just 32 percent from about 59 percent.</p>
        <p>The company's most recent annual report said that it did business in more than 120 countries; the report did not list all of the nations, although it noted that Halliburton operated in such politically unstable nations as Algeria, Angola, Nigeria and Russia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's role as chief executive of a multinational oil company has given him the chance over the past few years to weigh in on controversial foreign policy issues. At the top of his list has been ending the use of unilateral trade sanctions as a tool of American foreign policy. Speaking at an oil industry conference in Canada last month, Mr. Cheney urged that United States sanctions on Iran be lifted.</p>
        <p>He called relations between Iran and the United States a ''tragedy,'' adding that one of the best ways to improve ties with Iran would be ''to allow American companies to do the same thing that most other companies around the world are able to do now, and that is to be active in Iran. ''We're kept out of there primarily by our own government, which has made a decision that U.S. firms should not be allowed to invest significantly in Iran, and I think that's a mistake,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Halliburton and other oil service companies have faced consistent criticism from environmental groups. It also faces a wide range of domestic regulatory issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney has said that he will take a financial ''bath'' by giving up his lucrative post at Halliburton to run for vice president.</p>
        <p>Last year, he earned nearly $1.3 million in salary, and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that he owns 1,089,000 shares of Halliburton, including 860,000 options to purchase Halliburton shares at a reduced price.</p>
        <p>The market value of this package is around $43 million, based on today's stock price for Halliburton shares.</p>
        <p>As vice president, Mr. Cheney would earn $181,400 a year.</p>
