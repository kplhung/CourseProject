        <p>RICHARD C. VISCONTI is talking about the highs and lows of a job -- his -- and tracing a jagged shape in the air. A mountain he'd love to ski? The Manhattan skyline his job makes him responsible for? No digressions, please. Mr. Visconti is methodical, focused, exacting, and not one to humor us by going off on tangents about metaphors.</p>
        <p>So here are the highs: buildings that collapse, masonry that tumbles, scaffolding that twists in the wind. ''Sometimes,'' he says, ''this job's a pressure cooker.''</p>
        <p>And then there were the banner-bearing barges that floated by his office window.</p>
        <p>Mr. Visconti is acting commissioner of the city's Department of Buildings. So he is one of the handful of officials who gather, grimly, at urban disasters. When a Brooklyn town house exploded two weeks ago, and  when an architectural salvage shop in the East Village collapsed a few days later, he pulled all-nighters.</p>
        <p>So what about that word ''acting'' in his title? He is not doing Shakespeare on the side.</p>
        <p>''I can't really answer the question,'' he says, and neither could a City Hall spokeswoman who was asked why, after 14 months, Mr. Visconti has not been elevated or replaced. He suggests that his status has to do with word he sent to City Hall about the time he was promoted from deputy commissioner, in May of last year. His wife, Ronnie, had been in a serious automobile accident near their home in Jamaica Estates, Queens, and he was concerned about ''this issue of timing'': his job and her recovery.</p>
        <p>She is fine now, and he carries on, a long-serving acting commissioner.</p>
        <p>''I've never been concerned about the acting status,'' he says before listing changes he has had a hand in, from requirements that make new buildings more likely to withstand earthquakes to a new electrical code to a system for filing building permit applications by computer.</p>
        <p>But after nine years at the department, first as the assistant commissioner for technical affairs, later as the deputy commissioner, he still sees himself as a ''private sector person'' and ''an architect who had to interface with the department a lot.'' So he has a sense of the frustration that architects and builders feel about his agency.</p>
        <p>''Every project in New York is a contentious project,'' he says. ''You get these lawyers using the department to fight their battles.''</p>
        <p>Developers, of course, do the same. Once, several years ago, he met Donald J. Trump. ''The Donald came in'' and talked about the Empire State Building, Mr. Visconti said.</p>
        <p>What kind of an impression did Mr. Visconti make? For once, the famously talkative Mr. Trump was silent. After relaying the question, an assistant to Mr. Trump said, ''He really doesn't know the man, hasn't had anything to do with him, doesn't have any thoughts on him.''</p>
        <p>SOME officials suspect that his low profile is a result of his acting status. ''We see him on TV, we read about him in the papers, we see him in hearings, but he's not someone we know well,'' said Lisa Daglian, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields. ''The real problem we have is lack of staff at the Buildings Department, and that's something an acting commissioner is stymied by.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Visconti denies that his 700 employees are too few. ''We got more inspectors in our 2001 fiscal year budget,'' he says. ''We needed more inspectors, we testified at the Council that we needed more inspectors, the administration gave us more and the Council gave us more, so we're staffing up now. I feel comfortable with where we are.''</p>
        <p>That was the acting commissioner talking.</p>
        <p>''I can go two, three days without sleep,'' he says, the private practice architect talking again. ''In practice, you spend the day meeting, selling. And you spend the evening trying to do the work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Visconti, 53, was a partner at the Manhattan firm Beyer Blinder Belle Architects from 1981 to 1991 and was the director of technical services, overseeing construction documents and specifications. He worked on projects at the South Street Seaport, a 25,000-square-foot ski house in Aspen, Colo., and an addition to the old Barneys store at Seventh Avenue and 17th Street.</p>
        <p>''Things were going swimmingly until the economy turned and we had taken on too much overhead.'' The partners cut their salaries by 50 percent. Then he had to lay off 60 employees. ''No one wanted to hear, 'Go to Richard Visconti's office.' Then one day it was my turn.''</p>
        <p>The firm's senior partner, Richard Blinder, says Mr. Visconti volunteered to leave. ''There was a lot of talk about do we have too many partners,'' Mr. Blinder says. ''He just said, 'Look, I'll leave, and he left.' He took the initiative.''</p>
        <p>Using an administration buzzword, Mr. Visconti calls the brouhaha over the barge banner, a Dirtpile.com sign, ''a quality-of-life issue.''</p>
        <p>He complains about sign pollution, and about enforcement. ''We have to take each and every sign violation to criminal court,'' he says.</p>
        <p>The barge had the gall to float by as Mr. Visconti was staring out the window of his office at 60 Hudson Street, an Art Deco colossus that once was home to Western Union.</p>
        <p>Mr. Visconti says that when he saw the barge, he said something that could not go in a telegram, a sentence with a four-letter word. How unlikely. How unfocused. But that was after an all-nighter at the Brooklyn explosion.</p>
