        <p>The soggy field was covered with a blue tarpaulin and the clubhouse was almost empty after the Mets postponed last night's game against the Expos and scheduled a doubleheader for today. The handful of players who trickled into Shea to work out were intrigued when they learned that the Mets had added a new pitcher to start the first game of the doubleheader.</p>
        <p>Well, mildly intrigued. It was not Curt Schilling, who joined the Arizona Diamondbacks yesterday. Instead, the Mets recalled Grant Roberts from Class AAA Norfolk to make his major league debut, even though Al Leiter, who will pitch tomorrow against the St. Louis Cardinals, expressed surprise that he would not join Mike Hampton in starting today.</p>

        <p>The soggy field was covered with a blue tarpaulin and the clubhouse was almost empty after the Mets postponed last night's game against the Expos and scheduled a doubleheader for today. The handful of players who trickled into Shea to work out were intrigued when they learned that the Mets had added a new pitcher to start the first game of the doubleheader.</p>
        <p>Well, mildly intrigued. It was not Curt Schilling, who joined the Arizona Diamondbacks yesterday. Instead, the Mets recalled Grant Roberts from Class AAA Norfolk to make his major league debut, even though Al Leiter, who will pitch tomorrow against the St. Louis Cardinals, expressed surprise that he would not join Mike Hampton in starting today.</p>
        <p>A weary-looking Steve Phillips leaned against a wall in the press box last night and explained how the Mets were never close to a deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, who wanted and got young major leaguers for Schilling, their ace. He said the Phillies were also hesitant to trade Schilling to a team in their own division.</p>
        <p>''I'm not overly disappointed because from the beginning, the feedback I got, I perceived us to be a long shot,'' Phillips said. ''They legitimately liked the prospects they had to choose from in our organization, but they didn't want prospects.''</p>
        <p>With Schilling gone, Phillips said the Mets are not pursuing any help for their starting rotation. He said their ''primary and exclusive focus'' would be on the bullpen, meaning they could possibly acquire someone like Texas' John Wetteland.</p>
        <p>Phillips will continue speaking to as many as 10 teams a day to see if the Mets can add a left-handed-hitting outfielder or find a more experienced shortstop.</p>
        <p>Still, Schilling was the player the Mets wanted. Phillips made several  proposals to Phillies General Manager Ed Wade; some included major leaguers, but most included minor league prospects. Despite Phillips's persistence, the Phillies did not seriously consider his offers.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't get them to make a proposal to me in countering anything I was proposing to them,'' Phillips said. ''They didn't see a fit with the major league players coming back. Unless they shifted to go to the prospect route, we weren't the right fit for them.''</p>
        <p>Although Phillips would not say which players he had included in the various discussions, he said that ''the potential package'' of talent he offered was better than what the Phillies received. Yet Phillips said he understood why the Phillies wanted players who could help at first base, in the rotation and in the bullpen right away.</p>
        <p>Three hours before the trade was announced, Hampton predicted: ''We're not going to get Schilling. We're going to go with what we have.'' Hampton also said that he doubted the Mets would ever deal Roberts, who was 5-5 with a 4.35 earned run average, 73 strikeouts and 46 walks in 103 1/3 innings at Norfolk.</p>
        <p>Roberts throws a fastball that ranges between 89 and 92 miles an hour, a curveball, a changeup and occasionally uses a slider. He won his last start to end a streak of seven straight starts without a victory, a period in which he was 0-2 with a 4.99 E.R.A.</p>
        <p>One of the internal criticisms of Roberts has been his casual approach to pitching.</p>
        <p>''He's one of those guys who, if he could ever figure it out, he could be great,'' Leiter said. ''He throws in the low 90's. He needs to start listening some more.''</p>
        <p>Valentine acknowledged that the 22-year-old Roberts, who Leiter jokingly called Cy for Cy Young during spring training, needed to mature and had matured this season.</p>
        <p>''They said he's really developed emotionally,'' Valentine said. ''The one thing they said is he really rises to the occasion when he picks stuff up.''</p>
        <p>The reason the Mets promoted Roberts is because they would have needed a spot starter for Monday if they used Hampton and Leiter today because both would have been unavailable.</p>
        <p>Instead of using Roberts on Monday, the Mets will use him today and give the other starters an extra day of rest. Roberts had been scheduled to pitch last night for Norfolk, so he will work on five days' rest.</p>
        <p>''Why am I pitching Friday?'' Leiter teasingly asked a club official.  ''Maybe it's to get me against St. Louis. It doesn't make a difference.''</p>
        <p>To make room for Roberts on the 25-man roster, the Mets optioned infielder David Lamb to Norfolk. It is likely that the Mets will option Roberts to Norfolk between games so they can activate Kurt Abbott, who was on a rehab assignment at Norfolk for a lower back injury and who is eligible to return today.</p>
        <p>''I would rather pitch the first game, but the butterflies are going to be there anyway,'' Roberts told reporters in Norfolk. ''This was definitely a shock, the shock of my life.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Even if the Mets do not make a trade, Manager BOBBY VALENTINE still feels that they will reach the postseason. ''Absolutely,'' Valentine said. ''Because we've played very well. We're a playoff-contending team as it is right now, and we think we have the ability to get better as the year goes on.'' . . . ROBIN VENTURA (right shoulder) took 50 swings yesterday and said he still needs to participate in a full workout before he knows if he will be ready to be activated on Saturday. ''There's no pain in there right now,'' said a hopeful Ventura. . . . DARRYL HAMILTON (left big toe) will rejoin the Mets tomorrow and could start his rehab stint Monday. General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS called Hamilton's toe ''remarkably better.''</p>
