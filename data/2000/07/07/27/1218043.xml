        <p>A federal appeals panel here struck down as unconstitutional New Jersey's ban on so-called partial-birth abortions. The decision today mirrored a United States Supreme Court ruling in June.</p>
        <p>The unanimous 40-page decision by a panel of the Federal Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit was seen as a victory by abortion-rights groups that had challenged the 1997 law. It was a vindication as well for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, whose conditional veto of the measure pointed to its constitutional flaws as well as to ways of remedying them, but was overridden by the Legislature.</p>
        <p>As a result, the Legislature spent nearly $500,000 on private lawyers to defend the law, which was not enforced while the courts debated it.</p>
        <p>In its ruling, the three-judge appeals panel upheld a 1999 Federal District Court ruling, agreeing that the New Jersey law was ''unconstitutionally and incurably vague'' in its ban on a late-term procedure that opponents call ''partial-birth abortion.'' And in that vagueness, the panel said, the act imposed an ''undue burden'' on the constitutionally protected right of a woman to an abortion and could be construed to ban all abortions.</p>
        <p>''Indeed, we, as was the District Court, are left to wonder whether the drafters chose a path of deliberate ambiguity, coupled with public outrage based largely on misinformation, in an attempt to proscribe legitimate abortion practices,'' the ruling said. ''The Legislature could have passed a statute of more limited reach and still achieve its supposed objective. Instead, it decided to go farther.''</p>
        <p>Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, writing for the panel, noted that it had reached and written its opinion in the case before the United States Supreme Court struck down a similar law in Nebraska on June 28. The high court said the Nebraska law was vague, that it put an undue burden on a woman's right to an abortion and that it lacked any exception for the life and health of the woman involved. But because ''nothing in that opinion is at odds with this court's opinion,'' Judge Barry wrote, the panel issued its opinion without revisions or changes.</p>
        <p>The other panelists were Judge Leonard I. Garth and Judge Samuel A. Alito, who wrote a separate but concurring opinion. Judge Alito said he favored finding the New Jersey law unconstitutional, stressing that any limits on abortion must have an exception for the preservation of the health of the mother.</p>
        <p>Currently about 30 states have similar bans on the procedure, which opponents describe as any procedure in which the person performing the abortion partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child, then kills it and completes the delivery.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, the State Legislature paid a private lawyer $412,759 to defend the law, which they passed over the governor's veto and which the state attorney general and their own legislative counsel had warned them was flawed. Rae Hutton, a spokesman for Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, who along with the Assembly speaker pressed the override of Governor Whitman's veto, said today that the ruling had come as no surprise in light of the Supreme Court's ruling last month. But she added: ''We are looking at it to decide how to proceed and whether to appeal it.''</p>
        <p>Talcott Camp, a lawyer with the Reproductive Freedom Unit of the American Civil Liberties Union who represented Planned Parenthood of New Jersey and the state's A.C.L.U. chapter in their challenge of the law, called the ruling a vindication of women's constitutional rights.</p>
        <p>''Now doctors can continue to provide New Jersey women with the best care possible without this dangerous law that had a complete disregard for women's health,'' Ms. Camp said.</p>
        <p>Pete McDonough, a spokesman for Governor Whitman, pointed out that she had not simply vetoed the Legislature's measure, but had utilized the state's conditional veto to highlight flaws and suggest changes. He noted that much of what the court said had been recommended by the governor in her veto. Mrs. Whitman's support of a woman's right to an abortion has put her at odds with many in the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>''This was style over substance and a symbolic gesture,'' Mr. McDonough said. ''If they had done that we would have had a law that was constitutional on the books for the last two years and wouldn't have poured $400,000 down a rat hole.''</p>
