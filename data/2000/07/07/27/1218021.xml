        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, a relative newcomer to statewide politics, went on something of a philanthropic binge this month, giving a total of $72,500 on the same day to all 62 Republican county committees in the state. And for good measure, he sent an additional $4,000 to four Conservative Party county committees.</p>
        <p>In making the contributions, Mr. Lazio, a  Suffolk County native, was adopting a traditional strategy of candidates trying to expand quickly beyond their local fortresses of support: sow good will across the state by financing grass-roots party cadres. In Erie County, which includes Buffalo, Mr. Lazio gave $4,000. In tiny Franklin County, the gift was $500.</p>
        <p>The donations, though, did not put a dent in Mr. Lazio's Senate campaign treasury. The money came from an obscure state political action committee that effectively allows him to get around strict federal fund-raising limits.</p>
        <p>In fact, shortly before his PAC made the donations, several Lazio benefactors gave $2,000, the maximum allowed by law, to his official Senate campaign and then wrote checks to the PAC for as much as $8,000.</p>
        <p>According to campaign finance records, the PAC, which is called Friends of Rick Lazio, then sent the money to the local party committees, which are expected to receive it in the coming days.</p>
        <p>Under federal law, it would be illegal for Mr. Lazio to use the PAC to finance his Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton directly by, for example, paying for advertising. But the donations to the party committees, which come under the rubric of so-called party-building activities, fall under a vague area of the law.</p>
        <p>Dan McLagan, a spokesman for the Lazio campaign, said he expected that the donations would be used for voter drives, phone banks and other expenses intended to help local candidates and the Republican ticket in general.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio ''is eager to help with party-building efforts, and help local candidates who share his position on the issues,'' Mr. McLagan said.</p>
        <p>(In a curious oversight, the PAC listed Republican committees in 61 of the state's 62 counties as receiving money, excluding the one in Clinton County, which includes Plattsburgh. Evidence of hostility to anything that connotes the opposition? No, replied Mr. McLagan, that donation was inadvertently left off the contribution report.  ''There's a check,'' he said, ''even for Clinton.'')</p>
        <p>Robert W. Giarrusso, the Republican chairman in Onondaga County, which includes Syracuse, said the donations allowed Mr. Lazio to demonstrate that his interests extended beyond Long Island. ''It's showing that he is taking his money and he is sharing it with other than downstate,'' said Mr. Giarrusso, whose committee is receiving $4,000.</p>
        <p>Such dividends have led other politicians to take a similar tack, most notably Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic Senate candidate in New Jersey, a former investment banker who used his personal fortune to disburse tens of thousands of dollars to local committees and candidates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio set up Friends of Rick Lazio in 1995, soon after the Republicans gained control of Congress and he became chairman of a housing subcommittee, which made him a more attractive recipient for donations.</p>
        <p>The PAC has collected $127,320 this year. The Senate campaign has taken in $5 million. While that is a sizable amount, Mrs. Clinton is far ahead in fund-raising, and Mr. Lazio is under considerable pressure to fill his Senate treasury.</p>
        <p>The difference in contribution limits is stark. An individual can donate a maximum of $2,000 to a Congressional campaign, and a maximum of $76,500 annually to a New York PAC. Corporations can donate to PAC's in New York but not on the federal level.</p>
        <p>Many other elected officials have also formed these so-called leadership PAC's, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki and members of Congress of both major parties.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, Mrs. Clinton contended that Mr. Giuliani, at the time her rival for the Senate, was illegally using PAC money to finance his campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani called that ludicrous, adding that Mrs. Clinton was being a hypocrite because she was allowing Democratic committees to spend the largely unregulated contributions known as soft money on her behalf.</p>
        <p>Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, an advocacy group in Washington that is seeking tougher campaign finance rules, said these PAC's were being used so often to circumvent contribution limits that they should be prohibited. ''They simply become a way of getting around the federal campaign finance limits,'' Mr. Wertheimer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. McLagan, the Lazio campaign spokesman, disputed that criticism, saying the two committees were distinct. Friends of Rick Lazio was playing no role in the Senate campaign and was a vehicle for Mr. Lazio to funnel support to people he believes in, Mr. McLagan said.</p>
        <p>''They are completely separate,'' he said. ''But I don't think that it's unusual for people to support Rick so he can help candidates and causes that he supports.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio collected most of the PAC money last month at a fund-raiser held at the Long Island home of Christopher Quackenbush, who said he has been a friend of Mr. Lazio for many years. Mr. Quackenbush is head of investment banking at Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners, which is also involved works in mortgage finance, a field that Mr. Lazio helps oversee as housing chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quackenbush donated $25,000 to the PAC, and three other members of the firm each donated $2,000 to the Senate campaign and $8,000 to the PAC. Asked whether the PAC donations were intended to get around the Senate limits, Mr. Quackenbush said, ''We're aware of the campaign finance laws.''</p>
