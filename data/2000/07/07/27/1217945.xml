        <p>THE Digital Club Festival was billed as the largest online music show ever, a milestone in turning the Web into an entertainment medium.</p>
        <p>From Saturday through Tuesday, more than 200 live performances from clubs around the country were put on the Internet, including acts like De La Soul, Ben Folds Five and Patti Smith.</p>
        <p>Thousands of fans clicked on the Digital Club Network at www.digitalclubnetwork .com, the Web site that provides archived and live streaming-video performances from clubs across the country.</p>
        <p>But if the experiences of a few fans in New York are any indication, the Web, as a concert platform, is not ready for prime time.</p>
        <p>Jordan and Amy Trachtenberg saw parts of the festival at a club and online. They watched Andre Williams, a garage rocker, perform live at Lakeside Lounge in Manhattan on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>''It was electrifying,'' said Mr. Trachtenberg, the senior director of custom content for emusic.com. ''It was a small, intimate room, and you could sink your teeth into the energy. A guy got naked and stood by the window dancing. It was sick.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday night, they tuned in from their living room to the Explosion, a band that was playing at Maxwell's in Hoboken, N.J.</p>
        <p>They logged on to the concert site and selected the Explosion from more than 50 bands that were performing. After about three minutes of buffering, the audio and visual kicked in, and the Trachtenbergs were all smiles. A static shot of the band appeared in a 2 1/2-inch-by-3 1/2-inch box on the monitor of their laptop.</p>
        <p>While it was difficult to make out the facial expressions of band members or see their hands on the instruments, the sound came through clearly.</p>
        <p>''You miss the energy of being in the club,'' said Mrs. Trachtenberg, who finds the crush of bodies and smoky club atmosphere overwhelming.</p>
        <p>''But you can only see one concert if you're at a place,'' she said. ''With this, my favorite bands come play in my living room for me. Plus, this is happening in Hoboken and I'm in Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>But after about 10 minutes, the music stopped and the video froze.</p>
        <p>''Uh-oh, are they still playing?'' Mr. Trachtenberg asked.</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' Mrs. Trachtenberg said. ''They're still on the stage rocking out. We just can't see them.''</p>
        <p>They tried to get the site up on another computer, but after about 20 minutes, they gave up.</p>
        <p>''There must be high traffic,'' Mr. Trachtenberg said. ''That's just how it is.''</p>
        <p>He was right. Part of the site had crashed. The trouble lasted for about 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>The quality of what people are able to see and hear depends on the speed of their connection, how many streams the Web site has and what kind of computer (sound card, memory, processor speed), monitor and speaker system they have.</p>
        <p>The chief operating officer of the Digital Club site, Ted Werth, said: ''Saturday night, the average viewer had a fabulous Web experience. Sunday night, the average viewer might have gotten stuck in line for a while. Everybody tried to get into the show at the same time. and we had a bottleneck.''</p>
        <p>He said the site was in the process of adding servers in an effort to avoid the problem in the future.</p>
        <p>A group of students gathered at a dormitory at New York University had an experience similar to the Trachtenbergs.</p>
        <p>The students planned to watch Slick Rick, a hip-hop artist, on Sunday night via an Ethernet connection. They gushed about ''how cool'' the site looked.</p>
        <p>To make the online festival seem more real, the Digital Club Network built several ''pavilions'' where viewers could order T-shirts, CD's, food and even beer for delivery. Food could be purchased and delivered, for example, by Kozmo.com, which could be reached via a link on the Food Pavilion.</p>
        <p>''That's cool. That's really cool!'' said Louis Goldhaber, a summer intern at a record company.</p>
        <p>The students said they loved the concept. ''I'm a die-hard Sarah McLachlan fan,'' said Rachel Rosenblum, an intern at Tommy Hilfiger. ''If I couldn't get to the concert, I'd pay to see it this way.''</p>
        <p>Ten minutes later the images and sound froze, and Ms. Rosenblum changed her tune: ''I don't think I would pay for this yet.''</p>
        <p>Evelyn Chang, a self-proclaimed computer nonenthusiast, said she would be more inclined to watch when ''it's more like television.''</p>
        <p>The site did offer several shows with three cameras, but that was not the norm.</p>
        <p>''More cameras generate more data,'' Mr. Werth said. ''So for a consumer with a dial-up modem, the multicamera or televisionlike shoot is less appealing because it comes through looking worse. We'll roll out multicamera shoots when we think it'll be good for end viewers.''</p>
        <p>Slick Rick took the stage about 45 minutes late, but nobody at the dorm seemed to mind. Mr. Goldhaber said waiting for the artist was part of the club experience.</p>
        <p>When Slick Rick did appear, Mr. Goldhaber jumped up.</p>
        <p>''There he is! There he is!'' he said, pointing at a 3-inch-by-5-inch box on Ms. Chang's monitor, thrilled that he was able to see Slick Rick live. ''He's wearing his eye patch.''</p>
        <p>After about five minutes of straining to make out what the artist was saying, Mr. Goldhaber said: ''I wish I had a faster connection. This could be so awesome.''</p>
