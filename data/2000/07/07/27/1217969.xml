        <p>THE imposing facade of the main pipe organ at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in Manhattan looks about the same as it did before its recent overhaul. And its thousands of pipes still produce celestial blasts of trumpets in the treble and rumbling thunder in the bass.</p>
        <p>But beyond the facade and the ranks of pipes is a profound change that is causing rumbles not just beneath the floorboards of the sanctuary but also throughout the world where people listen to and treasure the mighty sounds of the pipe organ.</p>
        <p>The reason? Some of the sounds in the refurbished main organ are digital, produced by a loudspeaker instead of an organ pipe. That means that when the organist pulls a stop on the console to signal, say, an English horn or a chime or a flute and then touches the keyboard, the people sitting in the pews hear a digitally sampled version of a horn, a chime or a flute pipe recorded elsewhere. Stops are the knobs used to activate a row of pipes that make a particular sound, like that of a flute.</p>
        <p>While the sound of the main organ at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian has only a few digital contributors salted in among the regulars, the antiphonal division -- the main organ accompaniment sitting at the rear of the hall -- is now entirely digital. All of its sounds are produced by circuits and loudspeakers instead of pipes.</p>
        <p>Fifth Avenue Presbyterian is just one place where the king of instruments is being usurped by the prince of electronics.  In organ lofts throughout the country, relatively inexpensive circuits and loudspeakers playing digitally sampled sounds are taking the place of costly organ pipes.  Sometimes digital sounds are used solely for the deep bass notes of the pedal pipes and sometimes for the reeds, trumpets or other stops that are expensive to build and fussy to maintain. Sometimes the entire instrument is digital.</p>
        <p>Synthesized organ sounds are not new.  What is different is the quality of the sounds and the speed with which they are being adopted. Proponents say that with the increasingly sophisticated sampling techniques of digital technology, there is virtually no difference in sound between a true organ pipe and its digital impersonator. Any differences, they contend, are outweighed by the savings in money and space.</p>
        <p>Opponents argue that the sounds of the ersatz organ pipes is sharply inferior. They object to what they see as yet another musical sacrifice on the altar of frugality.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard D. Westenburg, director of music at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, defends the digital technology in his renovated organ loft. ''The electronics are so flawless that they replicate the real pipes with absolute integrity,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And the price was right. ''The cost was probably under $40,000,'' Dr. Westenburg said. ''Were we to buy those pipes, as well as installing a new division at the other end with its wind supply, there's no way it could be done for under $200,000 to $250,000. And we don't have to sacrifice the sound for the savings. We can enjoy the fruits of economy with the same results.''</p>
        <p>The economics of fake pipes are certainly powerful.</p>
        <p>Cornel A. Zimmer, an organ builder in Denver, N.C., whose company produces pipe organs, all-digital organs and combination instruments that include both pipes and electronic voices, explained the big difference in cost for a single stop. ''A low-end pipe stop costs anywhere from $10,000 to $30,000,'' he said. ''A high-end customized digital stop will cost about $2,000 to $3,000.''</p>
        <p>And the sound of that digital stop? Can it really fool the ear? Kent Tritle, who is the music director and organist at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan as well as organist for the New York Philharmonic, said that there were distinct differences in the clarity of sound between the actual and the digital. ''Setting a column of air in motion is what one pipe does,'' he said. ''No matter what you do, digitally produced sounds are coming through a speaker that's putting the air in motion. It sounds quite different.''</p>
        <p>The issue of the true sound of a pipe organ and its replacement by electronic counterparts is at the center of a deeply passionate debate. It is one thing, many musicians argue, to improve the sound of a pipe, but another entirely to abolish it.</p>
        <p>The trend toward digital enhancements is being firmly resisted by some groups, including the Associated Pipe Organ Builders of America, an invitation-only organization of more than 30 companies that account for  the majority of pipe organs produced in the United States.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to keep the organ from going down the slippery slope of electronic conditions that compromise it,'' said Charles Hendrickson, president of the organization and owner of the Hendrickson Organ Company in St. Peter, Minn.</p>
        <p>In fact, the group feels so strongly about digital voices that after an extensive debate, it now expressly forbids the use of most digitally sampled sounds, except for deep bass notes and some percussive sounds, like chimes and bells. The issue is so divisive  that some members of the organization left the group because they were unwilling to comply with the decision.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henrickson said his group was fighting to keep the tradition of the pipe organ alive. ''We want to retain the pipe organ as an authentic wind-blown instrument with as few electronic voices as we can,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the business of electronic voices, as the digitally sampled sounds are called, is booming, said John Carpenter, president of the Walker Technical Company in Zionsville, Pa., which makes many of the electronic stops, including the eight-foot flute harmonique at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian.</p>
        <p>''We give smaller churches the ability to afford something that sounds more like a pipe organ,'' Mr. Carpenter said. ''Put a few ranks of pipes on it and build the rest with electronics, and you'll have it much more like a total pipe organ.''</p>
        <p>One electronic enhancement for pipe organs has not been controversial: the use of microprocessors to make the job of pulling stops simpler during a pipe organ performance.</p>
        <p>The more stops, the more complicated the job of changing the sound. A mere mortal with two hands and two feet, already busy with the keyboards and pedal board, can be hard-pressed in the middle of a tricky passage when the time comes to change the sound from flutes to trumpets.</p>
        <p>Adrian Wadey, a design engineer at Solid State Logic Organ Systems in Brandon, England, and Livonia, Mich., designs some of the programmable stop systems that let organists create a single command -- similar to the computer shortcut called a macro  -- that specifies a number of physical actions by the stops. That lets the organist press a single button, called a piston, to put the command into effect. The pistons are usually under the keyboard or above the pedal and are operated either by a thumb or a foot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wadey, a young but seasoned player in the contentious world of electronic aids for pipe organs, is careful to explain exactly what he and his company do. ''We don't make electronic sounds,'' he said flatly.  ''We concentrate on real pipe organ sounds and tools that let the organist get as much as possible out of the organ.''</p>
        <p>At the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Mr. Tritle said that the programmable stop system on the church's mechanical-action pipe organ, designed and built by Mander Organs in London, was quite useful. He enters information in the microprocessor so that when he pushes a particular piston later, it moves the correct stops into position.</p>
        <p>''We have an antique key action,'' he said, ''but the modern convenience of electric programmable stops saves an enormous amount of time.'' If a piece requires rapid changes in sound, Mr. Tritle can program those changes in advance, setting memory levels for the stop selections before the performance.</p>
        <p>At another Manhattan sanctuary, Calvary Episcopal Church, where the organ is being renovated, the director of music, Harry L. Huff, is looking forward to the convenience of programmable stop action, as well as other innovations brought about by computer technology.</p>
        <p>The renovation at Calvary is being done by Bishop Pipe Organ Service, of Westfield, N.Y. Ron Bishop, the company's owner, is careful to point out that absolutely no digital voices are going into the instrument. ''It will have programmable stops, but no programmable sounds,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The organ at Calvary is electropneumatic. When the organist presses any key, an electrical switch closes and activates an electromagnet, which, with the help of a bellows to open a valve, sends puffs of air into the pipes. When the overhaul is complete, the organ's electromechanical switches and relays will be replaced by solid-state circuitry, Mr. Bishop said.</p>
        <p>So far, one digital stop has gained wide acceptability and prompted little criticism. It is the one used to create the bass sound of the pedal pipe, and it is popular because the large bass stops are expensive to produce and take up a lot of space. At this frequency,  16 hertz, sounds are almost beyond hearing range and are more like rumbles than notes. But even for this bass sound, some builders refuse to use digital enhancements.</p>
        <p>''It's a no-no,'' said John Pike Mander, president of Mander Organs in London. Mr. Mander does not put the digital bass stops on the instruments he builds.</p>
        <p>''Often the sounds are sampled from existing stops with strong basic tones but little harmonic development,'' he said. But pipe organ stops get their particular character through a layer of foundation notes plus a series of harmonics above them, he said. ''I don't think electronic notes, which characteristically have a lot of foundation and little harmonic development, make the right sort of sound,'' Mr. Mander said. A real bass pipe has harmonics that blend with higher-pitched pipes in a way that produces better sound, he explained.</p>
        <p>Objections like that seem pointless for some organists, like Robert Melhuish, the chapel organist at St. Mary's College in Moraga, Calif., and St. Joseph's Seminary in Berkeley, Calif.</p>
        <p>''The organs of the future are going to have core sets of pipe ranks and digital enhancements for the large and difficult-to-maintain pipes,'' he said. ''Because of the huge expense and the talent to maintain the pipes, digital enhancement is the direction the field needs to go in, and yet the field appears to be fighting it.''</p>
        <p>All the Stops</p>
        <p>As churches begin to modify and replace pipe organs, they have several options:</p>
        <p>TRADITIONAL -- All sounds are created by air forced through the pipes.</p>
        <p>HYBRID -- Many church organs now have some natural sounds, produced by pipes, and some electronic sounds, produced by amplifiers and speakers.</p>
        <p>ELECTRONIC -- The least expensive and most radical change eliminates the pipes entirely. All sounds are produced electronically.</p>
