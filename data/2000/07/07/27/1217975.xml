        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The ''tougher standards'' proponents have argued that if we accept  high-stakes tests as the measure of student achievement, teachers will improve their instruction and students will learn more. According to a July 24 front-page article, this seems to have happened; for example, 96 percent of this year's high school seniors had passed the New York State English Regents as of January. So what is the response of some? Make the test harder.</p>

        <p>Public education should be about opening doors and creating opportunities, not sorting students and assuring that a certain percentage fail in school. We can and must do much better than that.</p>
