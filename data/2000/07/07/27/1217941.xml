        <p>They were a patient lot.

        <p>Neither a postponement nor fear of mosquitoes or insecticide, much less the overcast skies, kept listeners away from the New York Philharmonic's rescheduled concert on Tuesday evening in Central Park.  The Philharmonic and the Parks Department estimated that there were 35,000 people on the Great Lawn.</p>
        <p>They were a patient lot. Having waited a day for the opener in the orchestra's annual free park series, postponed because of the discovery of mosquitoes bearing the West Nile virus, they sat politely through 15 minutes of speeches by city and Philharmonic officials before the musicians got down to business.</p>
        <p>Among the speakers were Zarin Mehta, the orchestra's personable new executive director, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who demonstrated the use of insect repellent.  The listeners seemed to zone out during the oratory: when the mayor delivered an instant-applause line (''the greatest orchestra in the world''), he was greeted with absolute silence and had to repeat the phrase with a demand for a response.</p>
        <p>The performance itself elicited greater enthusiasm, and not without reason. Andre Raphel Smith, the 38-year-old assistant conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, was on the podium in his Philharmonic debut, and he led a program that was not only accessible but also offered substance.</p>
        <p>Moments of festive ebullience (Glinka's ''Russlan and Ludmilla'' Overture) and folkish tone-painting (the dances from Copland's ''Rodeo'') were offset by stretches of quiet introspection (John Corigliano's ''Elegy'') and pained, terrified breast-beating (the Shostakovich Fifth Symphony).</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith is an agile, demonstrative conductor, one who is physically drawn into the music but who doesn't get so carried away as to forget to give cues.</p>
        <p>The orchestra played brilliantly for him, and even through the constricting electronic mediation of the Carlos Moseley Pavilion's sound system a listener could appreciate the suppleness of the wind playing in the Corigliano and Copland works and the finely tuned, richly textured string and brass playing in the Copland and Shostakovich.</p>
        <p>As is the tradition, the concert ended with a Grucci fireworks display.</p>
        <p>The concert is to be repeated tonight at Cunningham Park in Queens and tomorrow at Miller Field in Staten Island.</p>
