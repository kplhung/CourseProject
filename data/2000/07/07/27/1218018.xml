        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign began broadcasting a new 30-second advertisement downstate Tuesday. Unlike previous health care commercials by her campaign, it does not feature or mention her Senate opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio. Instead, in another first, it directly addresses Mrs. Clinton's leading role in the Clinton administration's failed 1993 health care proposal.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- DeVito/Verdi, along with Mandy Grunwald, a media consultant, and Mark Penn, a pollster.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial is a sunny montage of Mrs. Clinton speaking with patients and doctors in a hospital and talking with other people in various settings. The announcer points out that she has long championed health care and specifically notes that after Mrs. Clinton's universal health care plan failed in 1994, she successfully pushed for expanded health coverage for many Americans. Graphics flicker onto the screen throughout the ad. Their titles are ''Mammograms covered by Medicare,'' ''Longer hospital coverage for new mothers,'' ''Health care access to every child,'' ''A real Patients' Bill of Rights'' and ''Tax credits to help those without coverage on the job.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''She's talking about health care,'' the announcer says, ''because it's always been her cause. When her health care plan was defeated, she kept on fighting step by step and made a difference. Mammograms covered by Medicare. Longer hospital coverage for new mothers. In the Senate, Hillary will fight to provide health care access to every child, for a real patients' bill of rights and tax credits to help those without coverage on the job. Who'll be a strong voice for better health care?''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- To support the assertions in the advertisement, Mrs. Clinton's campaign staff points to policy speeches that she has given on the health care issues mentioned. All of the issues covered were in the 240,000-word proposal for universal health insurance that President Clinton introduced in 1994. Mrs. Clinton led the presidential commission that created the proposal.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The danger of the advertisement is that it will play into a long-term Republican strategy of using the health care plan to portray Mrs. Clinton as left wing and politically inept. The first lady was faulted at the time for trying to push health care legislation that many considered too sweeping, and for moving without consulting the public or many key members of Congress.</p>
        <p>A year ago, the commercial may have also played into Mrs. Clinton's cloistered image, but she has made efforts -- including her tour across the state -- to dismantle that perception. Mrs. Clinton's aides hope that the advertisement, which could be interpreted as a pre-emptive move, will transform one of the lowest moments of her public life and employ it to her advantage.</p>
        <p>It also plays to core Democratic issues, like expanded health care, without mentioning the liberal buzzwords that would turn off more moderate voters.</p>
