        <p>The State Department of Transportation said that the material used  would be Superpave, an asphalt that was developed to be resistant to  problems, like cracking and rutting, that are caused by low temperature and fatigue.</p>

        <p>The Thalle Construction Company, a road and utility contractor based in Briarcliff Manor in Westchester County, has been awarded a $29 million contract for the latest reconstruction work on the Taconic State Parkway.

        <p>The State Department of Transportation said that the material used  would be Superpave, an asphalt that was developed to be resistant to  problems, like cracking and rutting, that are caused by low temperature and fatigue.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki said that 42,000 vehicles use the Taconic daily. He added that Superpave is expected to last 20 years instead of the 15-year service life of regular asphalt. The work is expected to begin within a week and to be completed by November 2001, according to the State Department of Transportation.</p>
