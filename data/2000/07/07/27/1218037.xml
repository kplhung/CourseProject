      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Under the banner of religious liberty, Congress is nearing approval of a law that could make it harder to use zoning laws to save landmarked churches and church property from the wrecking ball. Senators Edward Kennedy and Orrin Hatch have rallied behind this bill -- known as the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act -- as a way to remedy abuses against religious groups by zoning boards. But it tilts the balance in favor of church administrators who may wish to use their properties for development and against local communities that may wish to preserve things as they are.</p>
        <p>Many New Yorkers retain bitter memories of the battle over the plan by St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church to build a 47-story tower on its historic site -- a proposal rejected by the city and eventually by the courts. As presently written, this new bill raises fears among landmark experts and local governments around the country that it will lead to renewed efforts to destroy historic sites, as well as to the costly court battles that inevitably follow. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani wrote New York's senators this week criticizing the bill and warning that it ''would 'federalize' an area which is inherently a matter of local concern,'' normally a rallying point for conservative Republicans.</p>

        <p>Under the banner of religious liberty, Congress is nearing approval of a law that could make it harder to use zoning laws to save landmarked churches and church property from the wrecking ball. Senators Edward Kennedy and Orrin Hatch have rallied behind this bill -- known as the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act -- as a way to remedy abuses against religious groups by zoning boards. But it tilts the balance in favor of church administrators who may wish to use their properties for development and against local communities that may wish to preserve things as they are.</p>
        <p>Many New Yorkers retain bitter memories of the battle over the plan by St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church to build a 47-story tower on its historic site -- a proposal rejected by the city and eventually by the courts. As presently written, this new bill raises fears among landmark experts and local governments around the country that it will lead to renewed efforts to destroy historic sites, as well as to the costly court battles that inevitably follow. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani wrote New York's senators this week criticizing the bill and warning that it ''would 'federalize' an area which is inherently a matter of local concern,'' normally a rallying point for conservative Republicans.</p>
        <p>The primary purpose of the bill is to limit the power of zoning boards to interfere with the practice of religion. Some local boards, for example, have tried to deny religious groups permits to feed the homeless. One Mississippi zoning ordinance denied a permit for an Islamic center in an area where there were Christian churches. Episodes like these warrant concern. But in seeking to provide a remedy, the bill would allow churches to sidestep even the most basic zoning requirements.</p>
        <p>New York's Senators Charles Schumer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan have been desperately trying to provide balance by clarifying the bill's vague language and attaching its legislative history. Such modifications could help, but the first responsibility of Congress is to slow things down and allow for hearings on a complicated matter that has received not nearly enough public debate about its potential consequences.</p>
