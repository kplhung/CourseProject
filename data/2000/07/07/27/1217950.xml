        <p>Nyabinghi music is to reggae what campfire spirituals are to gospel, and the Mystic Revelation of Rastafari, performing on Monday night at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, delivered a concise, presentable version of it.  They were partly re-enacting one of the religious conventions, called ''grounations,'' that they regularly hold in their West Kingston stronghold: Rastafarian revival meetings of dancing, singing, playing, cooking and worshiping that last for days.</p>
        <p>The group has legendary status; an earlier incarnation of it led by a master percussionist named Count Ossie, who died in 1976, backed the Folkes Brothers on ''Oh Carolina'' in 1960, which was the first popular indigenous-sounding Jamaican recording and paved the way for reggae. It made a triple album in 1973, ''Grounation,'' mixing jazz-influenced horns with chanting and percussion, which is an obscure treasure among reggaephiles. But the nyabinghi style went beyond this particular band; Bob Marley recorded nyabinghi songs, and in the recent moral backlash against the hard sentiments and harder music of Jamaican dancehall-reggae, some of dancehall's own practitioners have gone back to the nyabinghi style to demonstrate their own live-and-let-live Rastafarian faith.</p>

        <p>Nyabinghi music is to reggae what campfire spirituals are to gospel, and the Mystic Revelation of Rastafari, performing on Monday night at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, delivered a concise, presentable version of it.  They were partly re-enacting one of the religious conventions, called ''grounations,'' that they regularly hold in their West Kingston stronghold: Rastafarian revival meetings of dancing, singing, playing, cooking and worshiping that last for days.</p>
        <p>The group has legendary status; an earlier incarnation of it led by a master percussionist named Count Ossie, who died in 1976, backed the Folkes Brothers on ''Oh Carolina'' in 1960, which was the first popular indigenous-sounding Jamaican recording and paved the way for reggae. It made a triple album in 1973, ''Grounation,'' mixing jazz-influenced horns with chanting and percussion, which is an obscure treasure among reggaephiles. But the nyabinghi style went beyond this particular band; Bob Marley recorded nyabinghi songs, and in the recent moral backlash against the hard sentiments and harder music of Jamaican dancehall-reggae, some of dancehall's own practitioners have gone back to the nyabinghi style to demonstrate their own live-and-let-live Rastafarian faith.</p>
        <p>Mystic Revelation of Rastafari had 12 members on Monday night, and its music was built on drumming -- a large bass drum striking the first beat, a group of cheap, military-style ramskin funde drums on the one and three, and a ''repeater'' drum improvising with syncopation on top of it. After a warm-up oration by the rasta poet Mutabaruka, the group filed on stage with their hands in plastic chains, singing ''By the Rivers of Babylon''; at the end of the song, they shot their arms in the air, broke the chains, and shouted ''Uhuru!''</p>
        <p>Samuel Clayton, a singer and percussionists who doubled as announcer, followed with a short history of Jamaican slavery and a brief sermon on the purpose of Rastafarianism; he then explained that the group's set would be half grounation-music -- ''like a ground wire, a series of chants so that when things get rough you don't get shocked'' -- and half ''rockers.''</p>
        <p>Through it all, the rhythms of the music came from burru and kumina, pre-slavery African rhythms; the drummers sat in a circle. In the ''grounation'' half, a guitarist gently played standard major chords, and the group members sang biblical language in two-part harmony. It was simple, sleepy music, sometimes rather crudely done. In the more pop-like ''rockers'' half, Anthony Arnold Brakenridge played the trumpet and Egbert Evans played the saxophone and flute, interjecting melody into the songs; Donovan Cunningham played repeating vamps on the electric bass, and as a whole it sometimes sounded like elementary imitations of New Orleans or Memphis rhythm-and-blues.</p>
        <p>At odds with the self-consciously crude style was the group's presentation, finely honed for outsiders. The group hasn't played in New York before, but it has been touring Europe and has developed a demonstrative, pedantic stage show with strident politics, boosterism for Jamaican tourism and painted tchotchkes handed out to the crowd. It  was probably a bit too clunky for this particular audience, many of whom were Rastafarians or at least the most devout of reggae aficionados.</p>
