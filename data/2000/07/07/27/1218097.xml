        <p>Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat each pledged today to keep working at their halting quest for peace despite the breakup of the Camp David summit meeting.</p>
        <p>But the Israeli prime minister and the Palestinian leader both received homecomings that, while orchestrated events, still illustrated the difficulties they will continue to face as they try to forge a compromise on the highly emotional issue of Jerusalem, which proved to be the sticking point in the meetings.</p>
        <p>Initially, Mr. Barak returned to a somber, subdued ceremony at the airport near Tel Aviv, greeted by his close political allies. As he was driven up the hilly road to Jerusalem, it was lined with protesters, many in the knitted skullcaps favored by Israeli settlers on the West Bank, holding signs saying, ''Barak you are weak,'' in reference to his willingness to make concessions on Jerusalem to the Palestinians. But later, he was visibly moved by the throngs of supporters he found waiting at his official residence to welcome him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, by contrast, received a hero's welcome from start to finish as he arrived in the Gaza Strip -- precisely because he had refused to compromise on Jerusalem. Looking tired, he was hoisted up on the shoulders of his supporters, cheered by a crowd of some 5,000 and hailed, according to one of the slogans, as a modern-day Saladin -- the Muslim warrior who recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187.</p>
        <p>''We welcome you home with honor, heroic leader of the Palestinians,'' read a banner painted on a bedsheet. ''We hail your heroic stand in not surrendering a single centimeter of Palestinian land, and in not giving up Jerusalem. You are a great leader of the Palestinian people.''</p>
        <p>Despite the initial gloom and finger-pointing over the breakdown of the summit meeting, there was a sense among both Israelis and Palestinians that even by trying to grapple with the previously taboo subject of Jerusalem, the leaders had moved the peace effort to a new level of seriousness. That they would press on was implicit in the remarks by both leaders as they returned home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak told the small crowd at the airport, ''In your names, in the names of the millions of eyes still looking, hoping and praying, I promise not to despair, not to tire, not to stop pursuing peace.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, in Alexandria, Egypt, where he stopped en route home to confer with President Hosni Mubarak, and in Gaza, told reporters that ''the American side said they would continue with us.''</p>
        <p>''There is an agreement between us and the Israeli government made in Sharm el-Sheik that we continue negotiations until Sept. 13, the date for declaring our independent state with Jerusalem as its capital whether people like it or not,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the senior Palestinian negotiator, Saab Erekat, said he hoped to resume negotiations with his Israeli counterpart as early as Sunday. Mr. Erekat has been consistently upbeat following the summit breakup, declaring that ''prospects for agreement on all permanent status issues are stronger then at any time in the past nine years.''</p>
        <p>Despite widespread Israeli jitters that the breakdown of the Camp David talks might touch off a new round of violence by Palestinians, today passed quietly. The Israeli newspapers have been carrying reports, citing intelligences sources, that Palestinians were stocking up food, water, medicine and ammunition in anticipation of renewed confrontations, and that after the talks broke up, the Israeli Army was put on extra alert.</p>
        <p>But Palestinian officials appeared determined today to avoid clashes. Faisal Husseini, the top Palestinian leader in Jerusalem, urged calm here before traveling to Gaza to greet Mr. Arafat. A planned march from his headquarters at Orient House through the main Arab business section was canceled.</p>
        <p>''There will be no violence from the Palestinians,'' said Nabil Shaath, a ranking Palestinian official in Gaza, ''not unless Israel makes violence, or the settlers turn to it.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Barak arrived at the airport today, he appeared close to tears as he stood stiffly at attention while an army band played the national anthem, ''Hatikva.'' He hugged a line of waiting supporters, including bereaved parents from the Four Mothers movement, the first group to urge unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, and spoke of his journey to Camp David.</p>
        <p>''I went knowing there is no peace at any price, but that there is also no peace without a price,'' he said. ''A painful, difficult and heart-wrenching price. Today I return from Camp David and look into millions of eyes in whose name I went and say with a pained heart: we have not succeeded.</p>
        <p>''We did not succeed because we did not find a partner prepared to make decisions on all issues,'' he continued. ''We did not succeed because our Palestinian neighbors have yet to internalize that in order to obtain true peace some of one's dreams must be conceded; one has to give, not only request.</p>
        <p>''But I look today into the eyes of millions in whose name I was sent and say that we did everything we could,'' Mr. Barak said. ''We turned over every stone, we exhausted every possibility to bring about an end of the conflict and a safer future for Israel. And we still hope.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Barak arrived at his residence, he was met by a welcoming rally organized by the Peace Now movement -- across the street from a settler's protest. In the background, songs were played, including the ''Song for Peace,'' which Israel's former prime minister, Yitzak Rabin, sang just before he was assassinated in Tel Aviv in 1995.</p>
        <p>''Thank you all for coming here to strengthen us on our way to peace,'' he said getting out of his car and lingering with the crowd. He appeared overwhelmed by the throngs who waved banners praising him, and joined them in singing the national anthem.</p>
        <p>''We are long-distance runners,'' he said. ''We know what difficulties lie along the way, we know what it is to run uphill, we know there are moments when you lose your strength and you want to toss everything away. But we will not give up.''</p>
        <p>Also today, the Israeli Army chief of staff said that he, too, ''assessed the issue of negotiations has not stopped entirely.'' While keeping close watch on the Palestinians, he urged his troops to keep open channels to the Palestinian security forces, which could have ''an important effect on calming the ground.''</p>
        <p>''We have given guidelines to the forces in the field,'' said Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, ''to conduct themselves in a responsible and restrained manner, with the presence of high-ranking officers in the field, to prevent mistakes that could cause friction that could lead to one kind of outburst or another. I hope that this is also what is happening on the Palestinian side.''</p>
        <p>But at the same time, the army has distributed additional weapons, including machine guns and sniper rifles, to increase the arsenals already maintained by the sometimes volatile settlers.</p>
        <p>''The time has come for the settlements themselves to gird their loins and mobilize as one in carrying out security,'' the commander of the Samaria Brigade, Col. Yehuda Shaked, wrote in a letter to the 32 settlements in his district.</p>
        <p>Colonel Shaked also said in his letter that the few settlers who had been banned from carrying weapons because of extremist or criminal behavior should now reapply for permits because the criteria for distributing arms had been eased.</p>
        <p>A group of rabbis in the settlements is preparing to issue a religious Halachic ruling on when it is permissible to open fire if Palestinians march on their settlement. Other rabbis have already issued a ruling saying it is permissible to desecrate the Sabbath by shooting at people approaching a settlement, even if not sure of their intentions, because they might cause the death of Jews.</p>
        <p>Now that Mr. Barak is home, his immediate problem is assembling a new governing coalition. He now has only a minority of 42 seats in the 120-member Parliament, or Knesset, after the walkout by Shas, the party of Sephardic Jews (17 seats), the orthodox National Religious Party (5) and Natan Sharansky's party of recent Russian immigrants (5).</p>
        <p>Also, the Parliament is to debate two motions of no confidence in the prime minister on Monday. One was introduced by Likud, which said his negotiating position had endangered Israeli interests, including Jerusalem. The other, from the United Arab List, said he had estranged himself from Palestinian rights.</p>
