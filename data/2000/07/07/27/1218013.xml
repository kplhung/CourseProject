        <p>Attention, alarmed citizens: are you less than completely convinced that truck-mounted sprayers can zap every West-Nile-infected killer mosquito? Do you fear that  rolled-down shirt sleeves, long pants and socks are nothing but a porous Maginot line against the mosquito menace?</p>

        <p>Attention, alarmed citizens: are you less than completely convinced that truck-mounted sprayers can zap every West-Nile-infected killer mosquito? Do you fear that  rolled-down shirt sleeves, long pants and socks are nothing but a porous Maginot line against the mosquito menace?</p>
        <p>You have other options.</p>
        <p>Consider, for example, a footlong blue ovoid gadget dubbed Insector, the Bug Collector ($69.95), which has been, er, flying off the shelves of the Sharper Image store at 4 West 57th Street in the town now known as the Big Mosquito. This Mosquito Motel lures the detested insects to their deaths with a light and a fan, entrapping them and doing them in ''without any electric zaps or pops,'' as the sales label says.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Ignacio Pedulla, a 17-year-old student from Buenos Aires, was toying with the on switch of the Insector floor model, checking it out. ''I'm really scared about this, because when I was in Africa, these mosquitoes were killing everyone,'' he said. ''But I think I'll buy one of these when they're $25.''</p>
        <p>And so it went all over Anopheles World, a k a the metropolitan region, where the best buzz now is totally about mosquito repellence capability. Bug elimination is rampant in traditional, and cutting-edge, variations.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Sharper Image has sold eight of its Insectors in the last two days, according to Armando Rios, a manager. ''People are shutting their windows. They are looking for help.''</p>
        <p>If there isn't much panic, respect is being accorded a virus that killed 7 people in the region last year and sickened 55 others. Mosquito repellent, citronella candles, mosquito coils and protective nets ''are selling like crazy,'' said a salesman in the busy ''mosquito area'' of the Paragon sporting goods store at Broadway and 18th Street, who declined to give his name.</p>
        <p>''We have seen a big increase in sales of our bug stuff,'' said his less-shy boss, Joe Kirdahy, the store's merchandise manager. Virtually anything with the insecticide DEET is selling well, he said, as are ''mosquito coils that you light up, like incense.''</p>
        <p>Another popular item at Paragon is a ''natural'' nonpesticide repellent called Cactus Juice ($5.95), billed as ''the best alternative to harmful chemical-based products.'' The stuff is an extract of prickly pear cactus, made from ''free range cacti'' and mixed with ''SPF-20 sunscreen,'' according to the sales pitch. It says bugs hate cactus.</p>
        <p>Mosquito mania could very well make virus-obsessed citizens into fashion victims as well. Consider the matching mosquito pants and jacket ($20 apiece) available at Campmor, the gargantuan outdoor store on Route 17 North in Paramus, N.J. Then just top off that ensemble with a mosquito chapeau, or Head Net ($5 to $10, depending on degree of fanciness).</p>
        <p>Other citizens are rejecting gentle spray-on Avon Skin-So-Soft ($10) and that namby-pamby plant stuff, and going for high-test. ''We have had a lot of people within the past week asking for our strongest bug sprays,'' said Amy Pugh, an associate at Eastern Mountain Sports on 61st Street between Broadway and Ninth Avenue. That would, she said, be your 100 percent, longish-warning-label DEET.</p>
        <p>Consumer watchdogs have long warned the public to beware of devices promising expensive solutions to complex problems. But according to one customer, some of the Rube Goldberg gadgets could be effective. In April, before the West Nile spraying in Connecticut, Bill Finn, a lawyer who lives in Greenwich, ordered two Lentek mosquito control wristbands by mail from the Edge Company for $19.95 apiece. According to the catalog, they emit the sound of ''the wing-beat frequency of a dragonfly, the mosquito's most dreaded enemy.''</p>
        <p>Now, three months later, there is good news and bad news. ''I've only been bitten once or twice, and my wife hasn't been bitten at all,'' Mr. Finn said. The bad news is that mosquitoes still have the upper hand on the golf course. The Chinese-made Velcro-ish wristband attachment cannot withstand the rigors of a strong golf swing. It flies down the fairway along with the golf ball, Mr. Finn said.</p>
        <p>There are those, however, who have contempt for the dragonfly defense. ''Any ordinary dragonfly would be totally wiped out by these West Nile mosquitoes,'' said Shannon Taylor, a Manhattan lawyer, who advocates a more aggressive strategy. ''Maybe we should send the giant New York rats against the mosquitoes,'' he said of the rodent scourge of Gracie Mansion, then corrected himself. ''No, what you need against them is a really tough lawyer.''</p>
        <p>Other mosquito challengers tolerate high-tech solutions, but only the correct ones. ''I might buy a gadget that would protect me from all the spraying,'' said Elisa Tabibzadeh, a Manhattan dentist, who decided against buying the Insector.</p>
        <p>Now many of the mosquito beleaguered are turning to the Internet, where they can buy the Gadget Universe mosquito repellent watch ($24.95), or the cordless Mosquito Repeller ($14.95).</p>
        <p>Also still virtually available is the ThermaCELL Mosquito Repellent ($24.95), powered by a butane cartridge, and the EcoTech Bug-Ban, billed as the ''world's leading nontoxic insect-bite-repelling wristband'' ($33 for a dozen).</p>
        <p>While this is all very well, what happens when one is, ultimately, bitten? Well, try a spritz of Sting Eze, on sale at Paragon for $5, which ''stops the itching,'' Mr. Kirdahy said. ''But you know, it isn't going to stop the virus.''</p>
