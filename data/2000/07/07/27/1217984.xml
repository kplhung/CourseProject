        <p>Israeli-Palestinian peace talks ended Tuesday without a comprehensive settlement, but there were encouraging signs that both sides moved toward peace on some issues other than Jerusalem. The challenge now is to see whether the parties can build on this apparent progress, or whether they will slide back toward recriminations and violence.</p>
        <p>Israel's acceptance of Palestinian sovereignty over Gaza and most of the West Bank is the perfect example of how far things have come. Such sovereignty was once a taboo subject for most Israelis and American policy makers.</p>
        <p>But among other issues, East Jerusalem remains outside the grasp of the negotiators. Prime Minister Ehud Barak and President Yasir Arafat could not escape domestic political constraints against compromising historic claims. ''Arafat's ability to maneuver is nil,'' a Palestinian official said over the weekend, referring to how both the Palestinians and the larger global Muslim community demand a return of East Jerusalem. Mr. Barak showed flexibility in talking about shared sovereignty, but what was not enough for Mr. Arafat was too much for many Israelis, to whom any agreement will be submitted by referendum.</p>
        <p>There is no point in criticizing leaders for not making a deal that they could not make, except at the risk of losing the support of a majority of the people they represent.</p>
        <p>What next? Both sides talked -- probably too much -- about the inevitability of fighting if the negotiations ended without a final agreement. If this scenario plays out, the progress made at Camp David will be seriously diminished and hopes for genuine peace, at least in the near term, will fade.</p>
        <p>But if violence can be prevented or controlled, time itself may provide an answer, just as time provided an answer on Palestinian statehood. Peacemaking in the Middle East is a process, not an instantaneous event. Progress is sometimes measured in small steps -- from the original Camp David in 1978 to the 1991 Madrid Conference to the 1993 Oslo peace agreement through the present to the future. Time changes things, and as realities change, minds change. What was taboo yesterday can become thinkable today and doable tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The difficulty of settling an issue so deeply rooted in Muslim and Jewish faith and identity is not to be minimized. But the long view is more hopeful than the short view.</p>
        <p>President Clinton deserves real credit for convening the Camp David talks and for offering and advocating proposals on how to settle differences.</p>
        <p>And yet . . . .</p>
        <p>The administration has had seven years and six months to push this process along. The proper function of the Camp David summit should have been to tie up loose ends. Instead, the leaders, under tight deadline pressure, considered many important issues directly and face-to-face for the first time. It should not be surprising that they could not do years of work in 15 days.</p>
        <p>Regrettably, the Geneva meeting last March between President Clinton and President Hafez al-Assad of Syria ended in failure. Comprehensive peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without peace between Israel and Syria. Arguably, the Israeli-Palestinian issues would have been more easily settled if Israel and Syria had made peace first. And the principal issue with Syria -- return of the Golan Heights -- is much less complicated than most of the final-status issues between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Though his approach at Camp David was creative and proactive, I fear that at Geneva President Clinton may simply have presented the Israeli position to President Assad and recommended that he accept it, because it offered to return practically all of the Golan.</p>
        <p>A better approach would have been for the United States to make its own proposal, recommending the return of all the Golan conditioned on Mr. Assad's then agreeing to the firm security and access arrangements on the ground that Israel required, including restrictions on the the Sea of Galilee and on a narrow strip along the shore.</p>
        <p>This compromise should have satisfied both Israeli and Syrian political needs. Mr. Assad could have claimed to have received back ''all'' of the Golan to the June 4, 1967, lines, while Israel would have received the protection it required for the Galilee, which provides much of its water.</p>
        <p>The administration should prepare Congress and the American people for the fact that the United States will be asked to help finance the agreement, if it comes, by providing substantial funds to move Israeli military bases, establish new borders, resettle some Israelis from the West Bank and compensate Palestinians for land taken by Israel. Within reason, we should be prepared to pay our share of these costs. There will be no peace unless we do, and both our national interests and our values cry out for that peace.</p>
        <p>The challenge now for Israel, the Palestinians and the United States is to accept the disappointment that the talks ended without a comprehensive settlement, recognize the progress that was made, avoid rash actions and keep the process alive so that one day the descendants of Abraham may live together in peace.</p>
        <p>Such a result would answer the Psalmist's prayer for Jerusalem. ''May those who love you be secure. May there be peace within your walls and security within your citadels.''</p>
