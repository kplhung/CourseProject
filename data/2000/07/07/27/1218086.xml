        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article about the general incompetency of technical support is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
        <p>One must be careful buying Hewlett-Packard equipment, for example. Their 800 number does not get a human, and their technical support gives a bewildering menu that usually cannot be deciphered. And when you get a person, it is an iffy proposition whether you will receive help.  AOL needs no further database than its long history, and then there is Real Player and its Net congestion.</p>

And when you get a person, it is an iffy proposition whether you will receive help.  AOL needs no further database than its long history, and then there is Real Player and its Net congestion.</p>
        <p>One must realize that these may be half-baked products, not ready for prime time and foisted on suckers like us whose demands are not being met by a predatory market, while papers like The Times cheerily go on with their gee-whiz hypes and increase their advertising revenues.</p>
