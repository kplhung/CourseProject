        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: WORKERS RATIFY CONTRACT  The union representing 9,000 workers at Consolidated Edison announced yesterday that its members voted to ratify the tentative settlement reached with the company on June 25. Manny Hellen, president of Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America, had recommended the contract, which provides for a 13.5 percent raise over four years and has extensive job security provisions.</p>

        <p>HAUPPAUGE: ARBITRATOR RULES FOR POLICE  Suffolk County police will get a salary of about $105,000 a year by 2003 that will require an increase in property taxes, officials said yesterday. An arbitration panel broke a stalemate between the county and its police department over the contract, which calls for a 5 percent raise annually for four years. As a result, average property tax bills in Babylon, Islip, Brookhaven, Smithtown and Huntington -- the towns protected by the police force -- will rise about $133 next year, according to county estimates.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: SMITHERS FOUNDATION SUES HOSPITAL  The Christopher D. Smithers Foundation filed suit in federal court yesterday, claiming that a New York hospital had changed the philosophy of a treatment center in violation of an agreement with the center's founder, R. Brinkley Smithers, lawyers for the foundation said. Paul R. Levenson, the foundation's lawyer, said the alcoholism treatment center administered by St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center was opened with a $10 million gift from Mr. Smithers. But Mr. Levenson said the center had stopped following the abstinence-from-alcohol philosophy advocated by Mr. Smithers and adopted a moderation philosophy, thereby diminishing the Smithers name and misleading people about the treatment.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: PRICE-FIXING IN SCHOOLS  New York City education officials acknowledged yesterday that they had signed six-month food service contracts with 7 of 14 companies under federal indictments for price fixing. Louis Benevento, director of the school board's Office of Financial Operations, said at a Council hearing that the companies had submitted low bids. He said several potential bidders balked at the complexity of distributing food in the city's public schools, the nation's largest institutional customer besides the Department of Defense.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: ARREST IN YEARS-OLD HOMICIDE  A 30-year-old woman has been arrested in the 1992 murder of an elderly woman in her home in Far Rockaway, Queens, the police said yesterday. The suspect, Deidre Brown, was charged with murder in the death of Elizabeth Timmons, 85. Ms. Brown lived in the same building as Ms. Timmons, at 20-37 Seagirt Boulevard, and killed her in a robbery, the police said.</p>

        <p>GARDEN CITY: SOCIAL SERVICE FUNDS RESTORED  Nassau County Democrats have restored $3.5 million to social service programs. The move was required by the state and by Standard &amp; Poor's, which has been assessing the county bonds. The plan calls for restoring about 34 percent of financing to crisis and outreach centers and 100 percent of supplementary income to day-care workers for the current and next fiscal years. Jake Lynn, a spokesman for the Democratic majority, said the money was available because of a reduction in the number of county workers and a rise in hotel and pistol-registration taxes.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: DISPUTE OVER KING HOLIDAY  Wallingford, the only Connecticut town that does not give workers a paid day off for Martin Luther King's birthday, is seeking arbitration in the matter. Legislation signed by Gov. John G. Rowland in April requires Wallingford and other towns to give workers the day off, but each town can decide if they are paid. At issue is whether the town's six municipal unions will give up one of their 12 annual holidays in exchange for the King holiday.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>NEW BRUNSWICK: VIOLATORS TO BE PURSUED  The New Jersey Highway Authority is negotiating with several collection agencies that will pursue motorists who have not paid fines for improperly using E-ZPass lanes on the Garden State Parkway and the Atlantic City Expressway. The authorities say drivers, despite multiple letters asking them to pay a $25 fine, have ignored 180,313 violations.</p>

        <p>CAMDEN: $35 MILLION GRANT FOR CITY  Camden will get a $35 million federal grant to replace 511 dilapidated apartments, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced yesterday. The money, which is the maximum amount under the seven-year-old Hope VI program, is for demolition at the Springfield Gardens complex, and construction of 533 condominiums and rental apartments, plus a community center, said Andrew M. Cuomo, the federal housing secretary.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: MCGREEVEY WINS ENDORSEMENTS  In a sign that South Jersey Democrats were by no means unanimous in supporting Senator Robert G. Torricelli's bid for governor, the mayor of Woodbridge, James E. McGreevey, left, was endorsed by 75 officials from Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem Counties. But Mr. Torricelli, who already had won support from leaders in the more populous southern counties of Camden and Burlington, received the added backing of four former Democratic state chairmen: James Duggan, Richard Coffee, Ray Durkin and B. Thomas Byrne Jr.</p>

        <p>HAMILTON TOWNSHIP: TRIGGER LOCKS RECALLED  Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital is asking hundreds of people to return trigger locks for handguns that it gave away because the manufacturer says the locks may not work. In April the hospital gave away 600 trigger locks made by the Master Lock Company. On Monday, the company began a nationwide recall of 752,000 trigger locks, some of which may be opened without a key.</p>
