        <p>The United States Tennis Association is set to unveil a statue commemorating the late tennis champion Arthur Ashe by the American neo-expressionist artist Eric Fischl.</p>
        <p>The statue will be revealed on Aug. 28, the first day of the United States Open. A seven-foot tall figure of a nude black man, it is cast in the heroic tradition of ancient Greek statues of athletes. One arm soars toward the sky as if tossing a ball to serve and the other arm is behind the figure, as if weighted down by an imaginary racket. It will stand outside the Arthur Ashe Stadium at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, in Queens.</p>

        <p>The United States Tennis Association is set to unveil a statue commemorating the late tennis champion Arthur Ashe by the American neo-expressionist artist Eric Fischl.</p>
        <p>The statue will be revealed on Aug. 28, the first day of the United States Open. A seven-foot tall figure of a nude black man, it is cast in the heroic tradition of ancient Greek statues of athletes. One arm soars toward the sky as if tossing a ball to serve and the other arm is behind the figure, as if weighted down by an imaginary racket. It will stand outside the Arthur Ashe Stadium at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, in Queens.</p>
        <p>The statue, made of roughly modeled bronze, is not intended to be a likeness of Mr. Ashe, said Mr. Fischl, but rather a metaphor for his bravery and spirit. Mr. Ashe, the only black man to win Wimbledon and the United States and Australian Opens, died of complications of AIDS in 1993 at the age of 49. ''I was trying to find a way through the language of tennis and the language of the body to express some of what I thought were the attributes and values he represented,'' Mr. Fischl said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashe campaigned against discrimination and on behalf of those suffering from AIDS. At the base of the statue are carved his  words: ''From what we get, we make a living; what we give, however, makes a life.''</p>
        <p>At a time when few major contemporary artists are creating commemorative work, the commission of Mr. Fischl is unusual. He was chosen from a group of about 12 artists by a panel led by Mr. Ashe's widow and by Michael Ainslie, the former president and chief executive of Sotheby's, and a tennis association board member. ''When I saw it, I thought it was just stunning,'' Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, Mr. Ashe's widow, said of the mock-up of the statue that Mr. Fischl showed to the committee. ''It carried tremendous grace and power and form.''</p>
        <p>''I hope that people will respond that way and that they will get a sense of immediacy and power that we as a committee received ourselves,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The figure of the man in the statue seems to emerge from the ground, and with the outstretched arm, the entire work reaches 14 feet. It is to be the centerpiece of the Arthur Ashe Commemorative Garden, near the principal entrance to the Arthur Ashe Stadium.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fischl said that he drew inspiration from the Greek statues of ''The Discus Thrower'' and the ''Javelin Thrower,'' and Michelangelo's ''David.'' When asked about the subject's nudity, Mr. Fischl said that he originally considered creating a clothed figure as a memorial, but decided against it. ''I wanted something that was not time-specific, but of a more universal kind of time, a historical time.''</p>
        <p>''I just thought, no, I'm not interested in that. If they want clothes they should get another sculptor,'' he said. ''There's a form that represents the genitals. It's incredibly modest. The body is being formed as it moves up. That's the way I got around the issue.''</p>
        <p>Judy Levering, president of the  tennis association, said that in considering the statue's nudity, the committee ''felt that Eric very tastefully handles that and we were not upset about it.''</p>
        <p>The statue is being paid for by friends and family of Mr. Ashe, individual donors and the tennis association. The budget was about $500,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fischl, an enthusiastic tennis player who never met Mr. Ashe but saw him play, came into prominence in the 1980's for his paintings depicting the sexual tensions and neuroses of suburban life.</p>
        <p>One painting, ''Sleepwalker'' from 1979, showed a naked boy in a shallow pool who is apparently masturbating. Another, ''Bad Boy,'' was of a naked woman lying on a bed while a young man reaches into her purse. His painting ''First Sex'' suggested a woman masturbating, and in ''Dog Days,'' he showed a boy and girl on a balcony seemingly on the brink of having sex.</p>
        <p>But in recent years Mr. Fischl's work has undergone a change. His most recent show was of large-scale, Caravaggio-like portraits of his celebrity friends, including the director Mike Nichols, and one of his dealers, Mary Boone.</p>
        <p>''In recent years there has been much less sexual narrative,'' Mr. Fischl said of his work. ''I've always been a psychological painter.''</p>
