        <p>Creditors of South Korea's largest business conglomerate, the Hyundai Group, agreed to postpone debt repayment obligations for a leading affiliate of the conglomerate. Although Hyundai Group officials denied rumors of a severe cash shortage, the Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company was a day late in paying its employees this month, raising concerns about the conglomerate's financial condition. Debts at the construction affiliate totaled 5.1 trillion won at the end of 1999, of which 2.2 trillion won is due by the end of this year. ''We agreed to extend maturity on loans extended to Hyundai Engineering and Construction, in order to ease its short-term cash shortage,'' said Lee Youn Soo, vice president of the main creditor, Korea Exchange Bank.</p>
