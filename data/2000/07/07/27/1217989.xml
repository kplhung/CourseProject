        <p>PERU: HEADING OFF DEMONSTRATIONS -- Armored vehicles ringed Lima and the police stopped buses heading into the capital as President Alberto K. Fujimori worked to thwart a huge protest planned for Friday, his inauguration day, which will mark the beginning of his third five-year term. Alejandro Toledo, the opposition candidate who withdrew from a presidential runoff in May after accusing Mr. Fujimori of planning to rig the results, has vowed to put hundreds of thousands of protesters into the streets to disrupt the ceremony. As pressure mounted, Mr. Fujimori appointed a former opposition presidential candidate, Mayor Federico Salas, as his new prime minister.</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: PEACE TALKS FAIL -- Two days of peace talks in Geneva between Colombian government officials and the country's second largest guerrilla group, the leftist National Liberation Army, have ended without agreement.

        <p>MEXICO: TAX PLAN ATTACKED -- A proposal by President-elect Vicente Fox to eliminate sales-tax exemptions for medicines and most groceries stirred an outpouring of criticism on radio and television talk shows. Mr. Fox also proposed eliminating taxes on new cars under a plan to simplify Mexico's fiscal laws. He said he would use the new revenues to increase welfare payments to Mexico's poor.</p>

        <p>CANADA: TIES WITH NORTH KOREA -- Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement issued in Ottawa that Canada was establishing formal relations with North Korea and that he hoped that full diplomatic relations would be established by the end of the year. Canada is only the third member of the Group of 8 industrial nations, after Russia and Italy, to recognize the hard-line Communist state.</p>

        <p>CANADA: CONSERVATIVE TO RUN -- Joe Clark has decided to run for Parliament in a by-election expected for mid-September, seeking a central Nova Scotia seat seen as safe for his party, the Progressive Conservatives. Mr. Clark, an Albertan who briefly served as prime minister two decades ago, announced the run one week after a similar election bid was announced by his right-wing rival, Stockwell Day, the new leader of the Canadian Alliance.</p>

        <p>INDIA, PAKISTAN: KASHMIR OFFER REJECTED -- The Mutihadda Jihad Council, an alliance of Pakistan-based militant groups active in Kashmir, has suspended one of its leading members -- the Hizbul Mujahedeen -- after that organization made an unexpected cease-fire offer to India. The militants vowed to continue their struggle against Indian forces in the disputed region.</p>

        <p>IRAN: REFORMER SEEKS RE-ELECTION -- President Mohammad Khatami, elected on a reform platform that is promising increased social freedoms, said for the first time that he would seek a second term in elections next May. Mr. Khatami's attempts to promote a free press and democratic reforms since his landslide election in 1997 have been stymied by conservative forces.</p>

        <p>LEBANON: MISSING DECLARED DEAD -- A Lebanese government commission said it had concluded that some 17,000 people who disappeared during the 1975-90 civil war are dead. A seven-month investigation concluded that only a few of those reported missing were actually alive and said that most bodies found in mass graves would never be identified.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA, IRAQ: PUSHING TIES -- President Vladimir V. Putin said after a meeting in Moscow with Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, that he would press for an end to United Nations sanctions against Iraq. But he also urged Iraq to allow United Nations weapons inspectors to resume work. Iraq owes Russia billions, which it would be able to repay if it were able to freely export its oil. Russian companies are eager for business in Iraq if sanctions are lifted.</p>

        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: JOURNALIST GETS SEVEN YEARS -- A Yugoslav military court sentenced Miroslav Filipovic, a Serbian journalist who reported allegations of army atrocities in Kosovo last year, to seven years in prison for espionage and spreading false information. Mr. Filipovic, 49, worked for the independent daily Danas and for Agence France-Presse. He denied the charges and his lawyer said they would file an appeal.</p>

        <p>SOMALIA: AID WORKERS ABDUCTED -- Two workers from Action Against Hunger were kidnapped in Mogadishu, and the French aid group issued a statement in Paris saying it was negotiating for the release of the two employees, Francoise Deutsch, 46, of France, and Jonathan Ward, 31, of Britain. The Somali capital has been split by competing warlords since the central government collapsed nearly a decade ago, and Western aid agencies have repeatedly been targets for kidnapping.</p>

        <p>UGANDA: FIGHTING FOR CATTLE -- Rustling in the remote northeast of Uganda has claimed 95 lives, the Ugandan Army reported. Fights among the Jie and Dodoth members of the Karimojong tribe over cattle are common, though a battle last weekend between the two groups was more deadly than most. The army reported that the Jie killed 15 Dodoth in a raid, then the Dodoth killed 80 Jie as they pursued their stolen cattle. The Ugandan government has announced plans to disarm fighters in the region.</p>
