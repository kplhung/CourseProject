        <p>Lizard fans will be in herpetology heaven at Discovery.com's ''Lizards!'' (www.discovery .com/exp/lizards/lizards.html), a virtual exhibition developed with the American Museum of Natural History. Visitors can see the common flying dragon, a five-inch lizard from Southeast Asia, glide from tree to tree, and hear the raspy call of the panther chameleon of Madagascar. The cold-blooded beauties also include the thorny devil of eastern Australia (right), which typically eats 2,000 ants at each meal.</p>
