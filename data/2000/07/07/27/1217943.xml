        <p>A NEW study predicts that while undergraduate enrollments in computer science will increase rapidly, the proportion of women in that enrollment is unlikely to rise.</p>
        <p>''Women are going to be left behind,'' said Dr. Tracy Camp, a professor at the Colorado School of Mines who is co-chairwoman of the Association for Computing Machinery's Committee on Women in Computing, which has done several studies analyzing the proportion of women studying computer science. Dr. Camp is the lead author of the study.</p>
        <p>The new research found that women account for about 17 percent of the undergraduate computer science majors at United States universities that offer Ph.D.'s in computer science. About 80 percent of the universities responded. The study predicts a nominal increase in this percentage, to about 17.5 percent for the 2000-2001 school year, but then the proportion is expected to drop to between 16 and 16.5 percent.</p>
        <p>''There are certainly more students than in the past,'' Dr. Camp said. ''The raw numbers are increasing. But the percentage of women is not.''</p>
        <p>Between 1983 and 1996, the percentage of women earning bachelor's degrees at universities and colleges in computer science dropped from a high of 37.1 percent to a low of 27.5 percent, a 25.9 percent decrease. ''Our study confirms that this trend will continue,'' Dr. Camp said.  ''There is no evidence that these low percentages will rise.''</p>
        <p>The latest United States Department of Education figures for enrollments of women in computer science are for 1996. ''We did the study because the U.S. Department of Education is so far behind,'' Dr. Camp said. ''Computer science enrollments have changed so rapidly that we felt we needed to find out what was going on.''</p>
        <p>The percentages of women majoring in other sciences, including engineering, biological sciences, physics and math, have risen from the 1980's to 1996. ''It's not a huge increase, but it's there,'' Dr. Camp said. ''But in computer science, the percentage is stagnant.''</p>
        <p>The study, titled ''The Incredible Shrinking Pipeline Unlikely to Reverse,'' was supported by the Association for Computing Machinery and the National Science Foundation.</p>
        <p>Denise Gurer, co-chairwoman of the association's Committee on Women in Computing and a technologist at the 3Com Corporation in Santa Clara, Calif., said that there was a substantial attrition rate for women as they moved through the computer science career pipeline, from college to work. ''It starts early,'' she said. ''Women get turned off not only in college, but once they are at work.''</p>
        <p>The reasons women leave computer science are complex, but one cause is clear, Ms. Gurer said. ''The image of the white, male, antisocial nerd who sits in front of a computer turns women off,'' she said.</p>
