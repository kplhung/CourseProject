      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In a legal document filed yesterday, Microsoft argued that the government's antitrust case is ''completely unsuitable for direct appeal'' to the Supreme Court because it is complex and because the trial judge made ''serious and substantive procedural errors.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft wants its appeal to go first to the federal appeals court in Washington, which ruled in favor of the company in a related case.</p>
        <p>The company's argument, filed with the Supreme Court, rests heavily on a scathing attack on the work of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who heard the lawsuit in Federal District Court.</p>
        <p>The Microsoft document, citing interviews Judge Jackson granted to new organizations, including The New York Times, stated, ''The district court's blunt comments to the press raise serious questions about its impartiality.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft also questioned the even-handedness of Judge Jackson's decisions in general. First, the company asserted, the judge improperly allowed the Justice Department and 19 states suing the company to broaden their case. Then, after allowing the additional evidence, Judge Jackson assured the company that his findings would be based on the more limited, original complaint, according to the Microsoft filing.</p>
        <p>Those ''assurances,'' the company stated, ''the district court would later repudiate.''</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson ruled earlier this year that Microsoft was a monopolist that had repeatedly violated antitrust laws, and he ordered that the company be split in two -- an order he later shelved pending appeals.</p>
        <p>If the case goes straight to the Supreme Court, it could be resolved in a year. If it goes first to the appeals court, the resolution might take up to two years.</p>
        <p>The government is seeking to have the Supreme Court hear the appeal directly and sidestep a review by a federal appeals court. Direct appeals to the court are permitted in major antitrust cases brought by the government. Four of the nine justices must vote in favor for the case to go directly from the district court.</p>
        <p>In its filing, Microsoft is trying to persuade the court that the appeal will involve a thicket of technical issues, procedural challenges and disputed facts. Sorting out these matters, Microsoft says, will involve poring over the voluminous written record of the lengthy trial - precisely the kind of winnowing usually left to an appeals court. The Justice Department had no comment yesterday, other than a brief statement saying that the government ''will respond in its filing.''</p>
        <p>Still, there is little mystery about what the government's theme will probably be when it files its brief with the court on Aug. 15. First, according to legal experts, the government will say that the factual findings are clear and that the issues for appeal are a couple of big legal questions -- precisely the kind of major judgments of law that the court so often reserves for itself.</p>
        <p>The big legal issues, they say, are whether Microsoft's bundling of its Internet browser with its industry-standard Windows operating system was an illegal tying of two products and whether Microsoft's dealings with other companies was indeed ''monopolizing conduct,'' in legal parlance. Judge Jackson ruled that Microsoft's bundling move and its behavior did violate antitrust laws, and Microsoft is appealing his ruling.</p>
        <p>The government is also expected to make a forceful policy argument for the expedited appeal, given the importance of computer industry to the economy.</p>
        <p>''The government will say that Microsoft's monopoly is imposing a significant social cost while this case is on appeal and no remedies are in place,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school. ''It will say that not taking the case is a costly act, and that this is exactly the kind of case that was meant to go directly to the Supreme Court.''</p>
        <p>In its 30-page filing, Microsoft stated that the case ''went badly awry from the outset,'' referring to Judge Jackson's decision to permit the government to add additional evidence after the suit was filed in May 1998.</p>
        <p>That move, Microsoft said, allowed the Justice Department and states to ''transform their case beyond recognition.'' In doing so, Microsoft declared that the judge ''committed an array of serious and substantive procedural errors.''</p>
        <p>These errors, Microsoft said, included giving the company too little time for discovery and preparation of its defense to the expanding array of evidence.</p>
        <p>Much of the evidence in the case, Microsoft contends, should have been tossed aside as not being suitable for admission in court. ''The district court,'' Microsoft stated, ''largely suspended application of the federal rules of evidence, admitting numerous newspaper and magazine articles and other rank hearsay.''</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson, legal analysts say, did allow a wide range of written evidence in the case. But he gave that leeway to both sides, they said, noting that Microsoft submitted many newspaper articles, even press releases, as evidence.</p>
        <p>And the government maintained that the additional evidence presented after the complaint was filed was part of the ''pattern'' of anticompetitive practices Microsoft used to stifle competition. Thus, the government said, the additional evidence involving companies like Intel and Apple was not an expansion of the original complaint, but merely further examples that fit the same pattern of behavior. Judge Jackson agreed with the government.</p>
        <p>In its filing, Microsoft suggested that in its appeal, the company will seek to make sure that it no longer appears before Judge Jackson. It said his comments to the press should be considered grounds for a reversal or, at least, the basis for having the case sent to another district court judge if his remedy order is remanded for hearings, which is a possibility.</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson has explained that he spoke to the press because, given the importance and prominence of the Microsoft case, he thought that there was a public interest to be served by speaking to the press about his reasoning. None of the press articles were published until after he had issued his final order in June. But he did give interviews beforehand with The New York Times, which Microsoft cited in the filing.</p>
        <p>Stephen Gillers, a professor at the New York University law school who specializes in legal ethics, noted that the code of conduct for the federal judiciary states that ''a judge should avoid public comment on the merits of a pending or impending action.''</p>
        <p>The judge's comments to the press, Mr. Gillers said, could well give Microsoft a basis for avoiding Judge Jackson's court in the future. He termed Microsoft's assault on Judge Jackson's work ''uncommon but understandable.''</p>
        <p>''The bridges between Microsoft and Judge Jackson have been burned,'' Mr. Gillers said. ''Microsoft has nothing to lose.''</p>
