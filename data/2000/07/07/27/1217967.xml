        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a working photojournalist who strives to maximize the aesthetic and journalistic qualities of my photographs, I was somewhat surprised by the comparison between the work of the amateur and greats like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Eugene Atget and Walker Evans (editorial, July 21).</p>
        <p>In particular, I do not believe that any part of the process of capturing the decisive moment is a function of ''luck.''</p>
        <p>Having looked at thousands of photographs taken by friends and relatives who suggest that they captured a striking moment, I have become convinced that great photographs are not ''accidental.'' Rather, a careful skill of connecting one's intent with an ability to compose and time a moment leads to a masterpiece.</p>
        <p>I would suggest that the anonymous amateur photographs described in your editorial are not happenstance occurrences or ''the luck of the living moment,'' but rather an amateur's diligent work at cultivating a particular skill that some call the job of being a photographer.</p>
