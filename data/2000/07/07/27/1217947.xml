        <p>Richard Wagner had in mind that all things low and vulgar would be left behind at the bottom of the green hill on which he built his opera house. Listeners and artists alike would make the short climb between rows of sheltering trees and find in the theater he dedicated to himself refreshment and renewal.</p>
        <p>After 124 years, the trees have grown and the myth of the Bayreuth Festival with them. The annual summer event is with us again. ''Parsifal'' was played on Tuesday night, raising its hand in a kind of preliminary blessing toward the work to come. The first performances of a newly produced ''Ring des Niebelungen'' begin tonight with ''Das Rheingold'' and run through the week. The staging is by Jurgen Flimm; Giuseppe Sinopoli conducts.</p>
        <p>Wagner might be alarmed to find how near to his citadel of purity the coarseness of the world has encroached. The high street leading to his house, Wahnfried, is a merchandiser's gantlet of cheap-looking clothes, fast food and expensive watches.</p>
        <p>Vulgarity has even made its way up the hill. The opening night audience, with only a smattering of foreigners, preened itself with displays of elegance and material good fortune. And inside Wagner's plain but dignified Festspielhaus were intermittent hacks, coughs and unidentified bumps and bangs, intruding on this temple of silence. It took the final scene of ''Parsifal,'' a moment of extraordinary and reverential beauty, to put a less-than-perfect world in its place. Wolfgang Wagner's 11-year-old production was not helpful. It is a homely, slightly awkward affair to begin with and has not aged gracefully. Movable pillars shaped in jumbles of solid geometry reverse themselves to form interior walls. Klingsor (Hartmut Welker) comes and goes on a kind of slow-moving elevator. Costumes are modest to a fault.</p>
        <p>Tuesday's collection of singers was mixed in quality, but then what international Wagner cast is not? Bayreuth at least has a radiant Kundry, Lithuania's Violeta Urmana, and in Andreas Schmidt an earnest and devoted Armfortas. Matthias Holle sang Gurnemanz with touching dignity, although his appearance in the part came as a late-hour surprise. Hans Sotin, with 29 seasons at Bayreuth behind him, withdrew (or was asked to withdraw, depending on whom you ask) because of ''unbridgeable differences'' with the conductor, Christoph Eschenbach.</p>
        <p>As Parsifal, Poul Elming has a clear heldentenor voice of unusual health. He is a tall, youthful presence onstage and works hard at his part, so it is a shame he is not a more compelling musical personality. Titurel, Mr. Holle's original role, was taken by Alfred Reiter.</p>
        <p>Top billing in the end belonged to the Festspielhaus itself. ''Parsifal'' is the only opera Wagner wrote with the sound of its unusual acoustics already in his ears. Contrary to later Wagnerian trends, the great man's priorities tilted toward words and acting. The house's wood surfaces disperse voices with unusual clarity. The covered orchestra pit subdues the big ensemble to such an extent that the first rising trumpet figure, a dominant voice in most opera houses, blends sedately into the rolling string figures. Such a space tends to flatter even a mediocre orchestra, although this one was better than that. Bayreuth's splendid chorus, crucial to any ''Parsifal,'' needed no flattery at all.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eschenbach took the prelude so slowly that the line between the stately and the moribund was sometimes confused. Klingsor's scene, on the other hand, went at a furious speed. The final act was deeply moving, rising to the level of religious piety and ancient barbarism to which Wagner's crypto-Christian world of holy relics and holy bloodshed aspires.</p>
        <p>The composer, who wrote a lot of heavenly music, found time in his leisure hours to produce a family from hell, and today his descendants squabble and intrigue as they always have about the festival's future. Arguments for and against tradition are slippery. Wolfgang, Wagner's 80-year-old grandson, has the upper hand now, but family agitators for new ideas and artistic renovation are closing in.</p>
        <p>The Festspielhaus reeks of atmosphere and history, and its rituals (no applause after Act I of ''Parsifal''; doors opened, shut and locked by a rigid observance of the clock) are followed as by a congregation in church. Yet the staging is traditional in the questionable sense of the word. Its self-conscious gesturing and choreography address a set of audience expectations long since superseded.</p>
        <p>Conservative and conservation are words with the same root, and who knows, maybe the workmanlike simplicity of Tuesday's ''Parsifal'' would have appealed to its composer. He would have been less pleased, I think, with those sitting in the theater, whose aura of vanity and public display was precisely what the Bayreuth Festival was intended to do away with.</p>
        <p>Then again, the rich, the powerful and the politically connected need as much enlightenment as anybody else, maybe more.</p>
