        <p>Roses Without Blooms</p>
        <p>Q.  I have two Queen Elizabeth climbing roses on a west-facing wall that gets sun all afternoon. The bushes are about five years old. They have lush foliage but have produced only one flower between them in all these years. I have cut them back severely. I have also let them grow. The canes get 12 to 14 feet long, but do not bloom. I give them rose food in the early spring, hoping that if I'm good to them they will produce, but no luck.</p>

        <p>Roses Without Blooms</p>
        <p>Q.  I have two Queen Elizabeth climbing roses on a west-facing wall that gets sun all afternoon. The bushes are about five years old. They have lush foliage but have produced only one flower between them in all these years. I have cut them back severely. I have also let them grow. The canes get 12 to 14 feet long, but do not bloom. I give them rose food in the early spring, hoping that if I'm good to them they will produce, but no luck.</p>
        <p>A.  Try a little benign neglect. Climbing Queen Elizabeth blooms only on old wood, so no matter how long they get, those canes have to winter over before they will produce their medium pink flowers.</p>
        <p>In early spring, as soon as new growth appears, remove any wood that's obviously dead. A couple of weeks later, go back and cut off anything that looks sickly, cutting back beyond the point of weakness and dipping the pruners in alcohol between cuts. Don't cut anything else. Apply the eats, and stand back.</p>
        <p>Trouble With Poppies</p>
        <p>Q.  I live in Houston. For four years I have been trying to grow annual lettuce-leaf poppies, using seeds from plants that grow on abandoned lots here and elsewhere around the state. I plant them in March or April, in wooden containers that provide good drainage. The soil is rich but light. Each year, the plants sprout rapidly, grow to about four or five inches, then develop spots on the leaves, turn pale and die. I have never thinned them out, preferring to let the process happen naturally. Am I doing something wrong, or is Houston's hellish humidity to blame?  A.  Since the wild ones are doing all right in Hades, it's likely your problem is a combination of rich soil and late planting. Most poppies, including the P. somniferum you've been collecting, are adversity fans: they like it lean and cold. They also like a bit of breathing room. Think of your urge to thin them as a natural one and indulge it.</p>
        <p>It's also possible that the soil has become heavily infected with fungus spores. To be on the safe side, empty the containers and, wearing rubber gloves, wash them with a bleach solution (one-quarter cup household bleach to each gallon of water). Replace the soil with a new batch, cutting its richness by adding one part sand to every three parts soil.</p>
        <p>Scratch the soil surface, and scatter the seed in November or December. Press it in firmly, but don't cover with extra soil. Baby plants will be one of your first signs of spring, with flowers following about 14 weeks later.</p>
        <p>Overwintering Strawberries</p>
        <p>Q.  My large terra-cotta strawberry jar is flourishing, with plants producing both berries and runners. Can I winter it over (in Providence, R.I.) instead of starting fresh next spring? Do I take the jar indoors, leave it outside, mulch it or what?  A.  Freezing won't bother the strawberries, but it could crack the jar, and mulch won't help unless you bury the jar in a pile the size of a haystack.</p>
        <p>The best storage place is an unheated basement or garage where it's dark, slightly damp and cold (35 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit). The goal is to let the plants go dormant and then keep them that way.</p>
        <p>Cut off all the runners before storing the jar. Over the winter, water sparingly if at all; the soil should be just moist enough to prevent total desiccation.</p>
        <p>Feed with soluble fertilizer when you set the jar out next spring, and feed again when blossoms appear. Expect to start over after the next cycle. By then, the soil will be tired and so will the plants, which bear most heavily when they are young.</p>
