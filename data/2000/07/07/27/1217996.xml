        <p>Treasury and Internal Revenue Service agents yesterday raided the South Carolina headquarters of J. K. Harris Inc., the nation's largest company helping people settle back tax debts at a discount.</p>
        <p>The company represents 18,000 individuals and small business through a network of 350 offices.</p>
        <p>About 20 agents arrived in the North Charleston offices with a large truck to take away records.</p>
        <p>The company sent about 150 employees at three offices in two buildings home for the day, said John K. Harris, the company president.</p>
        <p>''Our size and success in representing'' people before the I.R.S., Mr. Harris said, ''has also made us a target by the I.R.S., as well as certain competitors. We are cooperating fully with the government.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris said the subpoena was for documents bearing his signature that allow him to represent taxpayers before the I.R.S. as a certified public accountant. Mr. Harris has surrendered his license as a certified public accountant in two states.</p>
        <p>The raid included agents from both the Treasury inspector general for tax administration and the I.R.S. criminal investigation division.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris said that he first learned his firm was under investigation six weeks ago.</p>
