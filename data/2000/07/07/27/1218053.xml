        <p>George W. Bush was seething with frustration. Here he was, feeling as Texan as the chaw he liked to tuck under his lower lip, and he had to smile gamely while the audience snickered at him as an alien in cowboy boots.</p>
        <p>It was 1978, and the 31-year-old Mr. Bush was trying to get a start in politics by running for Congress here in West Texas. A candidate forum was under way, and his rival was needling Mr. Bush with an oft-repeated joke in which he was the punchline, a yarn that reinforced a perception of him as a spoiled rich kid from back East.</p>
        <p>Kent Hance, the Democratic candidate and a smooth-talking good old boy, was telling a yarn about working in a field along a rural road. Then along came a fancy car.</p>
        <p>''It was a Mercedes,'' drawled Mr. Hance, raising his eyebrows, and the audience tittered knowingly at the hint that Mr. Bush was the kind of man more comfortable in a Mercedes than a pick-up. ''The guy rolled down the window and wanted to know how to get to a certain ranch.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hance recounted how he'd given the man directions, telling him to turn right after a cattle guard, a metal grate ubiquitous in rural roads to keep livestock from straying. ''Then,'' Mr. Hance continued, ''he said, 'what color uniform will that cattle guard be wearing?' ''</p>
        <p>The audience roared with laughter, and just to be sure that the voters got the connection with the Connecticut-born Mr. Bush, Mr. Hance said he had noticed something else about the Mercedes: ''It had Connecticut license plates.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush lost that race for Congress. Yet the story of his entry into politics, and particularly of that campaign, suggests that it left a deep imprint on him, one evident today as he campaigns for the White House.</p>
        <p>Back then, Mr. Bush ran an energetic but deeply flawed campaign. He chose a race that may have been unwinnable, and then let himself be portrayed to many voters as an over-educated phony out of touch with ordinary voters -- ironically, a bit the way some Bush supporters now look at Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush first entered the Congressional race, he was still single and struggling to start an oil company. He was not obvious Congressional material: he lived in a bachelor's flat, his bedframe tied together with one of his neckties, and he dressed exclusively in ratty denim or in clothes that did not match.</p>
        <p>''You've got to understand what a bad dresser George was,'' said Joe O'Neill, a  friend from those days. ''George didn't dress down, which intentionally looks bad. He just dressed bad. He dressed in the dark.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush campaigned feverishly from morning to night in his white Oldsmobile Cutlass, usually running late, his volunteers sitting beside him and struggling to domesticate him.</p>
        <p>''He chewed tobacco,'' recalled Lisa Nowlin, one of those volunteers, ''and we always had to carry a spit cup so he could spit out the tobacco before he saw the Methodist preachers.''</p>
        <p>Older people were sometimes put off by what they saw as Mr. Bush's cockiness, but the young volunteers were dazzled by his enthusiasm. ''No matter how late the activities of the previous evening, he was always up early the next morning and working in a way I'd rarely seen in Lubbock,'' said J. Michael Weiss, whom Mr. Bush met while shaking hands at a shopping mall and turned into a volunteer county chairman.</p>
        <p>''Of course,'' Mr. Weiss added reflectively, ''Lubbock is maybe not the high-energy capital of the world.''</p>
        <p>A Life Steeped in Politics</p>
        <p>George W. Bush is often seen today as a very late entrant into politics; he is running for president after holding elective office for just five years. Yet in another sense, he has been engaged in politics one way or another since his teens and has considered various runs for office since his 20's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was first exposed to politics at the age of 17, when his father ran for the Senate, and later he worked full-time on Senate campaigns in Florida for Edward J. Gurney and in Alabama for Winton M. Blount, nicknamed Red. The lure of these campaigns was not policy but the adventure of a statewide campaign; a friend recalls Mr. Bush saying that he spent his time in Alabama drinking and dating.</p>
        <p>Diane Paul, a girlfriend of Mr. Bush when he was in his mid-twenties, said that Mr. Bush was fascinated even then by politics and searching for a way to run for office.</p>
        <p>''He was very active trying to see how he could get his nose into politics,'' she said, ''trying to figure out what was going to be his next move.''</p>
        <p>In 1971, when he was 25, Mr. Bush found a spot. A seat in the Texas State Senate was coming open in Houston the next year, and he chewed over with friends the idea of running for it.</p>
        <p>''He explored it, he had conversations with the mayor, and he went to a couple of functions to test the waters and talk to people about it,'' said Donald B. Ensenat, his roommate in Houston at the time. ''I assume he decided not to run because he thought he wouldn't win, because he thought he wasn't ready.''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Bush went off to Harvard Business School and then started business in 1975 as an oilman in Midland, the West Texas city where he had spent his childhood. Just two years later, a terrific opportunity seemed to tumble into his lap. George Mahon, the local Democratic congressman, announced his retirement after 43 years in the House.</p>
        <p>George W. immediately leaped into the race to succeed him. Shortly afterward, he resumed an acquaintance with a one-time seventh-grade classmate, Laura Welch. After a whirlwind courtship, they married on the first weekend available.</p>
        <p>It was a useful marriage. For a candidate like Mr. Bush who some saw as a rootless and immature carpet-bagger, it was helpful politically to settle down and start a family, particularly with a local girl who was an authentic West Texan. But the young couple seemed absolutely in love as they roared around the district on the campaign trail, and there was almost no muttering about the sheer political convenience of it all.</p>
        <p>What drew Mr. Bush into politics?</p>
        <p>In an interview, he rejected the suggestion that he had followed his father into politics, saying instead that he had been angry at Carter administration policy on natural gas pricing. But in a 1995 conversation with a historian, Herbert S. Parmet, Mr. Bush emphasized the degree to which his own family legacy pushed him into the political world.</p>
        <p>''There is a passing on of tradition, passing on legacy, passing on responsibility,'' Mr. Bush said then, according to Professor Parmet's transcript of the conversation. ''So I don't think it's a conscious effort. I don't think it's any of this thing where, you know, 'by God, young man, if you play your cards right you, too, may end up in politics.' It's more of an inherent trait.''</p>
        <p>A Famous Name's Consequences</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush may not have had a decent suit when he announced his candidacy, but he had other assets -- among them a first-rate name. George Bush had been a prominent name in Texas ever since his father had begun his political career in 1964 with a campaign for the Senate and then, after losing, served two terms as a congressman from Houston.</p>
        <p>The elder Bush ran for the Senate unsuccessfully again in 1970, but by then his star was rising in the Republican Party: he was mentioned three times as a possible vice president -- twice for President Richard M. Nixon, once for President Gerald R. Ford --  and became famous by holding a series of posts like ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican National Committee and director of central intelligence.</p>
        <p>The younger Mr. Bush's key supporters in the 1978 campaign were his buddies in Midland, people like Donald L. Evans, who is now the chairman of his presidential campaign. In addition, friends of the father helped out the son or contributed money.</p>
        <p>Financial reports showed that among those donors in 1978 were William Ford, vice chairman of the Ford Motor Company; Donald M. Kendall, the chairman of Pepsico; A. W. Clausen, chairman of Bank of America; Peter O'Malley, owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers; and even Mrs. Douglas MacArthur from her suite in the Waldorf Towers back in New York.</p>
        <p>It would have been difficult to imagine an unknown 31-year-old who had barely held a job running for Congress -- had it not been for Mr. Bush's name and his family connections. But it soon became apparent that there was also a downside to this pedigree.</p>
        <p>The other candidate in the Republican primary runoff, Jim Reese, the courtly and conservative mayor of Odessa, initiated attacks on Mr. Bush using themes that still reverberate today. Indeed, some of the epithets later attributed to Ann Richards when she competed -- and lost -- against Mr. Bush in the 1994 contest for governor, like Junior or Shrub, were first used by Mr. Reese in 1978.</p>
        <p>Sensitive to the perception that he was simply playing on his name and background -- a sensitivity that continues to this day -- Mr. Bush asked his father not to campaign for him and played down the connection.</p>
        <p>''We don't need Dad in this race,'' Mr. Bush told The Midland Reporter-Telegram. ''We don't need anyone in this race but the people of this district.''</p>
        <p>Yet the Congressional primary runoff became a proxy battle between two national Republican giants, for Ronald Reagan and the elder George Bush were dueling in preparation for the 1980 Republican presidential nomination, and Mr. Reagan did not want a Bush family victory in Texas. Mr. Reagan contributed $3,000 from his own political action committee to Mr. Reese's campaign and taped a television commercial for him. This infuriated the Bush family.</p>
        <p>''I'm not interested in getting into an argument with Reagan,'' the elder Mr. Bush told The Washington Post at that time. ''But I am surprised about what he is doing here, in my state.''</p>
        <p>''They are making a real effort to defeat George,'' Mr. Bush added indignantly.</p>
        <p>Young George also found himself pummeled by conspiracy-minded right-wingers.</p>
        <p>His father was a member of the Trilateral Commission, a group of prominent internationalists working for cooperation among the United States, Europe and Japan. Word spread among farmers that the commission intended to create a world government and was responsible for depressed crop prices.</p>
        <p>''We were going broke farming, and we were fighting anything that was keeping us down,'' recalled J. C. Lewis, an Oklahoma farmer and retired Air Force pilot who flew down to Texas to campaign against Mr. Bush in small towns like Wolfforth.</p>
        <p>Gerald McCathern, a prominent farmer in the area, said: ''We were always voicing the opinion, 'if you support the Trilateral Commission that your father is in, then farmers can't support you.' And he wouldn't back down. He would say 'he's my father and I support my father.' ''</p>
        <p>Missteps Along the Trail</p>
        <p>The most common interpretation of the 1978 campaign is that Mr. Bush was a wonderful campaigner and natural-born politician. But this seems to be a gloss burnished by time and the selective memories of Mr. Bush and his friends.</p>
        <p>Here in West Texas people say that Mr. Bush was personable and a quick study but still made a series of mistakes, largely through inexperience.</p>
        <p>For example, there was the day, early in the campaign, at a candidate forum on a farm near the town of Dimmitt. ''Today is the first time I've been on a real farm,'' Mr. Bush said, beaming at the crowd.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reese, who was next to speak, began by saying: ''I want to assure you, this is not the first time I've been on a real farm.''</p>
        <p>Then there was the TV commercial Mr. Bush dreamed up to demonstrate how energetic he was: it showed him jogging on a track. In those days, joggers were about as common in West Texas as Martians.</p>
        <p>''The only time folks around here go running,'' Mr. Hance, the Democratic candidate, told audiences, ''is when somebody's chasing 'em.''</p>
        <p>Ernie Angelo, a Midland businessman and prominent Republican leader in Texas, said that people either have a natural instinct for politics or they don't. Back then, Mr. Angelo said, he did not see it.</p>
        <p>''In his campaign in '78, I didn't get the feeling that he had the knack for it,'' Mr. Angelo said of Mr. Bush. Since then, Mr. Angelo has revised his opinion and now believes Mr. Bush has tremendous political instincts.</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Bush beat Mr. Reese handily in the Republican primary, taking 56 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>''George has been underestimated every time,'' Mr. Reese reflected the other day, as he sat on a couch in his home in Odessa. ''I did it initially. Ann Richards did it in the governor's race. And Al Gore may be doing that now.''</p>
        <p>Everybody knew that the winner of the Democratic primary, Mr. Hance, would present tougher competition. A smooth-talking farmboy who had grown up in the area, Mr. Hance was a rising political star who represented a state senate district that largely overlapped with the 19th Congressional district they were fighting over.</p>
        <p>''Kent Hance was a down-home boy, real homey, and George W. wasn't homey like Kent,'' recalled Johnnye Davis, a Republican leader in Odessa. ''He didn't come across to the voters as well as Kent did, with the little jokes that Kent told.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush now is sometimes mocked for an ignorance of policy details, back then people thought he had the opposite problem: a tendency to drop references in his speeches that baffled audiences, like a discussion of anti-inflationary economic policy.</p>
        <p>''He was quick, a bit too quick, so that people didn't always get it,'' Mrs. Davis said. ''He was so darn intelligent that a lot of what he said went over people's heads. He's learned to explain things a little better since then.''</p>
        <p>Another problem was that while Mr. Bush never really had a clear campaign strategy, Mr. Hance did: he focused his campaign on emphasizing local ties and on casting Mr. Bush as a carpet-bagger from the East. One of Mr. Hance's most effective radio spots was this one, read by an announcer:</p>
        <p>''In 1961, when Kent Hance graduated from Dimmitt High School in the 19th congressional district, his opponent George W. Bush was attending Andover Academy in Massachusetts. In 1965, when Kent Hance graduated from Texas Tech, his opponent was at Yale University. And while Kent Hance graduated from University of Texas Law School, his opponent'' -- the announcer's voice plunged -- ''get this, folks, was attending Harvard. We don't need someone from the Northeast telling us what our problems are.''</p>
        <p>Otice A. Green, a long-time political consultant who has worked on campaigns since 1956 -- including Mr. Hance's in 1978 -- said that Mr. Bush made a ''good entry'' into politics and was an impressive candidate. But, he added: ''Kent Hance was one of the best I ever saw.''</p>
        <p>It would have helped Mr. Bush if Republicans had united around him and vouched for him as a genuine West Texan. In retrospect, several Republicans think Mr. Bush should have tried much harder to get Mr. Reese's strong backing for the general election.</p>
        <p>''Any time I was asked, I told people I was supporting George,'' Mr. Reese said. ''But I don't remember him asking me to campaign for him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush spent a third more than Mr. Hance in the general election campaign, but the extra spending played into the Democrats' hands. Mr. Hance denounced Mr. Bush for getting 64 percent of his campaign contributions from outside the district.</p>
        <p>''Those contributions from the Northeast concern me,'' Mr. Hance declared at one public meeting. ''The Northeast has been in direct conflict with us on oil and gas and agriculture.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush complained that Mr. Hance's numbers were wrong. Over all, he said, only 48 percent of the money came from contributors outside the district.</p>
        <p>''We've been attacked for where I was born, for who my family is, and where my money has come from,'' The Midland Reporter-Telegram quoted Mr. Bush as saying. ''I don't think that's fair.''</p>
        <p>Backgrounds Became the Issue</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and Mr. Hance did not have any particular ideological or policy disagreement. Indeed, The Reporter-Telegram wrote that at one appearance the two men were asked what difference there was between them.</p>
        <p>''Well,'' Mr. Bush said finally, ''I've got more hair.''</p>
        <p>''I wish I did,'' Mr. Hance, who was balding, responded wistfully.</p>
        <p>''Hance would have made a good Republican,'' Mr. Bush told the audience.</p>
        <p>''And Bush would have made a good conservative Democrat,'' Mr. Hance affirmed.</p>
        <p>So in the absence of policy differences, their differing backgrounds and styles loomed over the race.</p>
        <p>''Yale and Harvard don't prepare you as well for running for the 19th Congressional district as Texas Tech does,'' Mr. Hance told audiences.</p>
        <p>Farmers continued to ask the candidates about the Trilateral Commission, and Mr. Hance shrewdly replied: ''I don't know anything about it. But in 1973 when the Trilateral Commission was formed, what were you getting for corn and wheat? And what are you getting now?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's father was appalled that his membership in the Trilateral Commission was hurting his son's candidacy. So he wrote to Mr. McCathern, the farm organizer, and suggested a meeting to clear the air.</p>
        <p>''He wrote me a four-page handwritten letter asking me to meet him in Houston any time that was agreeable,'' Mr. McCathern recalled. ''He wanted to help his boy any way he could.''</p>
        <p>They had a ''very, very affable meeting'' in Houston, Mr. McCathern said, and Mr. Bush resigned from the Trilateral Commission a few days before the election. But if the elder Bush kept his cool over the issue, the son occasionally lost his.</p>
        <p>Mel Turner, a local radio personality and a Republican, said he was leaning toward Mr. Bush but was troubled by the matter of the Trilateral Commission. At a candidate forum at the Branding Iron restaurant in Odessa, Mr. Turner stood up and asked Mr. Bush about the Trilateral Commission and whether his father was working for one-world government.</p>
        <p>''He jumped like he'd been pricked,'' Mr. Turner said. Then, after the meeting, Mr. Turner stood at the door to say goodbye to the candidates.</p>
        <p>''Junior Bush comes up, refused to shake my hand, looked me square in the eye and said, 'you . . . ' '' using a crude epithet, Mr. Turner recalled. ''Then Kent Hance came up and said, 'Mel, I'll see you up at the Tech game.'''</p>
        <p>''Here's a Republican candidate stepping on the wrong toes,'' Mr. Turner said. ''He was an arrogant rich kid, a spoiled brat.''</p>
        <p>A Failure to Fight Back</p>
        <p>Late in the campaign, disaster struck the Bush forces.</p>
        <p>A university student was organizing a ''Bush bash'' to recruit young people from Texas Tech, and placed an advertisement in the student newspaper promising free beer. In fact, the event was tame and ended early, but the Democrats had their ammunition.</p>
        <p>Five days before the election, a law partner of Mr. Hance wrote a public letter denouncing the Bush campaign for using alcohol to lure young people. The letter went to 4,000 members of the Church of Christ in Lubbock, and copies were put under windshield wipers of cars of people attending church services.</p>
        <p>''Kent's opponent, young Mr. Bush, apparently is using tactics to secure votes which do not indicate the same high character,'' the letter declared. ''Mr. Bush has used some of his vast sums of money in an attempt, evidently, to persuade young college students to vote for and support him by offering free alcohol to them.''</p>
        <p>The local newspapers wrote about the incident, quoting Mr. Hance as saying: ''Maybe it's a cool thing to do at Harvard or Yale.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush called a news conference in which he fumed: ''His campaign has been funny. First he attacked my family, then my background, and now my morals.''</p>
        <p>Supporters of Mr. Bush found out that Mr. Hance owned a building that was leased to Fat Dawgs, a bar in Lubbock. Some of Mr. Bush's friends urged him to accuse Mr. Hance of hypocrisy, but he refused; voters would reward a candidate who took the high road, he told supporters.</p>
        <p>''His weakness was that he wouldn't go for the jugular,'' said Jane Anne Stinnett, a cotton broker and longtime Lubbock Republican. Ms Stinnett said that she argued for a tough response to the beer bash accusations, but ''he just didn't want to do it.''</p>
        <p>A few days later, Mr. Bush was defeated, 53 percent to 47 percent.</p>
        <p>''We were glad the race was over,'' Mr. Hance said. ''He was really improving every day.</p>
        <p>''He's a bright guy, and he picked up the issues and got better as time went on,'' Mr. Hance added. ''If it'd been two weeks earlier, we would have beaten him worse. If it'd been two weeks later, it would have been really close.''</p>
        <p>Of course, if Mr. Bush had won, it might not have been the best thing for his career. He would have become part of the Washington establishment, and would not have cultivated the beyond-the-beltway aura that has been his strength since he re-entered politics by running for governor in 1994.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Hance, he ran for the United States Senate in 1984 but lost and ended up a  lawyer in Austin -- and a supporter of the Bushes. Mr. Hance recalled that while in Congress, he met another young Southern Democrat, a Tennessean named Al Gore, and grew friendly with him. After seeing both men in action, he concluded that Mr. Bush is a far more effective campaigner.</p>
        <p>''I'm convinced that Bush is going to be beat him and beat him soundly,'' Mr. Hance said. ''I served with Gore and I know him, and I like him. But I'd hate to ride from Lubbock to Los Angeles with him. If you rode from Lubbock to Los Angeles with Bush, it'd be loads of fun. And Gore'd be saying things like, 'I see some mountains.' ''</p>
        <p>Lessons From the Campaign</p>
        <p>So what did Mr. Bush learn from his first political contest? How did it change him?</p>
        <p>He seems to have learned that a candidate needs to pick his races, for it may have been impossible for a Republican oilman from Midland to win in an overwhelmingly Democratic district dominated by agriculture and the rival city of Lubbock.</p>
        <p>''It was an interesting lesson,'' Mr. Bush said in an interview. ''Sometimes there are races you just can't win.''</p>
        <p>Another lesson, some of Mr. Bush's friends say, is the need to respond forcefully to accusations like those about the ''Bush bash.'' The high road may be honorable, he discovered, but it does not necessarily lead to elective office.</p>
        <p>More broadly, that first campaign taught Mr. Bush, as his old pal Mr. O'Neill puts it, ''don't let your opponent define you.''</p>
        <p>''He defined George as a carpet-bagger, and it's nonsense,'' Mr. O'Neill mused. ''So that's the lesson George learned: When someone comes out with something, he's on it like a chicken on a June bug, because he's not going to let someone else define him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hance believes he taught Mr. Bush two lessons. First, he said, he showed Mr. Bush the need to cultivate the religious right, those church-goers who he had largely ignored during the campaign and who in the end voted against him on the alcohol issue.</p>
        <p>And second, he thinks, he helped teach Mr. Bush the need to be more folksy.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Hance put it: ''He wasn't going to be out-Christianed or out-good-old-boyed again. He's going to be the good old boy next door.''</p>
