        <p>FEMI DAWKINS, a Jamaican artist, and Anna de Boer, a Dutch artist, create walls and floors in vibrant colors, inspired by the Ndebele and Yoruba peoples of Africa. They commute from Amsterdam to clients in New York and Los Angeles, who relish their European-African mix. ''A true middle ground,'' Ms. de Boer said.</p>
        <p>African pigments and patterns, and fabrics and figures, have long inspired Western artists, but now -- whether traditional or reinterpreted -- they are firing design imaginations. Credit all the museum shows of African design, today's penchant for handcrafted forms, even the current passion for rich wenge wood, which fits today's freer, looser Modernism.</p>
        <p>1.  Stark Carpet now makes carpeting in patterns inspired by kuba cloth, $18.50 a square foot; 979 Third Avenue (58th Street), to the trade. Even a Chanel link might appear in interpretive walls and floors by Dawkins de Boer (2 , 7 , front page inset), which start at $2,500 (011-31-20-671-6685).</p>
        <p>3.  A raffia stool looks tribal with its nutshell-adorned surface; $250 at Homer, 939 Madison Avenue (74th Street). A raffia pillow cover, left, of kuba cloth is $110 from Craft Caravan, 63 Greene Street (Spring Street). Right, a Western interpretation is $140 from Room, 182 Duane Street (Hudson Street).</p>
        <p>4.  From left, a new cotton-and-raffia fabric design, 54 inches wide, is from  Senegal; $175 a yard at Claire Beaumont, 466 Greenwich Street (Canal Street). Mud cloth throw with beaded fringe is $25. Cotton print, in many colors and patterns, is $5 a yard. Both at Harlem Market, 116th Street and Lenox Avenue.</p>
        <p>5 . African animal skins shown here are from farmed animals sold for meat. From Craft Caravan, zebra pillow from Zimbabwe ($200) and, right, buck hide pillow from South Africa ($130). A 10-inch copper bowl covered in pony skin ($340) and an aluminum bowl in black leather ($180) are from Room.</p>
        <p>6.  From left, an African wood mortar and pestle is $25 at Your Super African Grocery, 215 West 116th Street (Lenox Avenue). A candle echoes wood's rich look. Ebonized mango wood vase, $70, at Mxyplyzyk, 125 Greenwich Avenue (13th Street). A round mango wood box is $55 from eziba.com, or (888) 404-5108.</p>
        <p>8.  Kasese Sheep Chair by Hella Jongerius, a high-tech take on wood-and-hide Ugandan chairs (carbon fiber, fiberglass and wool felt); $3,700 at Moss, 150 Greene Street (Houston Street).</p>
        <p>9.  The global mix includes old and new: An antique low Ethiopian chair of wood and goat-hide strips is $900 at Craft Caravan. Armand Ventilo's rosewood stool ($130) and patinated-metal table lamp ($200) are at Ventilo, 69 Greene Street (Spring Street). Mango wood bowl, $35 at Mxyplyzyk. Stenciled cowhide from Tribal Arts Collection as carpet (shown) or upholstery; $18 a square foot at Edelman Leather, (800) 886-8339, to the trade.</p>
        <p>Front page: Daybed ($3,500) in Senegalese cotton and raffia, at Claire Beaumont. Rubberwood lamp ($310)  looks carved;  Mxyplyzyk.</p>
