        <p>Some of this year's nastiest computer viruses have propogated through Microsoft Outlook. As soon as the viruses hit, they get into the software's address book and mail copies of themselves to every e-mail address listed.</p>
        <p>Imagine that there were some way to lock up those address books, effectively blocking any chance for the viruses to multiply. A company called CopyTele has recently added a feature to one of its high-level encryption devices that is designed to do just that.</p>
        <p>The device called the Cryptele USS-900 plugs into a computer, fax machine or telephone. Its primary purpose is to keep voice and data communications private. If someone tapped the phone line, for example, the overheard conversation would be unintelligible without a key to unencrypt it.</p>
        <p>Last month, engineers added the virus-protection feature. It does not stop a virus from inflicting damage on a computer if a malicious attachment is opened. But it does stop the virus from replicating. ''That virus would die on your computer,'' said Frank W. Trischetta, senior vice president for sales and marketing. The device, which starts at around $1,000, is priced for the corporate market. But Copytele officials say that it could be a boon to regular consumers, too, if it succeeds in halting viruses before they spread out of control.</p>
        <p>Microsoft, meanwhile, has released a software patch that it says will make its address books less vulnerable. Once the patch is installed, the system alerts its users when an external program is trying to gain access to the address book and asks their permission to continue. (The update can be downloaded from www.microsoft  .com/office/outlook/).</p>
        <p>Because the patch is a software solution, Mr. Trischetta argued, virus writers may be able to devise their own computer program to get around it.</p>
