        <p>The Concorde that crashed into a hotel near Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris on Tuesday, setting off a fireball and killing 113 people, had been delayed from taking off by last-minute repairs to the engine that burst into flames, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Officials investigating the crash said they had not yet linked the repairs to the crash. But on Tuesday they said that the engine that caught fire as the supersonic jet began its takeoff, more than an hour behind schedule, was the No. 2 engine.</p>
        <p>And today, Air France officials said in a statement that ground crews had unsuccessfully searched for spare parts for the No. 2 engine and eventually repaired it with parts taken from another Concorde.</p>
        <p>According to Elisabeth Senot, who is in charge of the judicial investigation into the crash, it was the control tower that first warned the captain that one of his engines was on fire, 56 seconds after permission was given for takeoff. The captain responded, ''Fault in engine No. 2,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Today, however, Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot would not confirm Ms. Senot's account that the control tower was the first to alert the pilot of a problem.</p>
        <p>According to Ms. Senot, the pilot tried to direct the jet to the smaller Le Bourget Airport nearby for an emergency landing. But the airliner, unable to gain altitude, banked heavily to the left and then slammed into a small wooden hotel here surrounded by fields.</p>
        <p>''I think we can say that we are looking at a technical problem here and can put aside notions of sabotage of any kind,'' Ms. Senot said. She said she based her account on a preliminary review of the information in the plane's ''black boxes,'' which record details of the flight and have been recovered.</p>
        <p>Today, roads leading to the crash site, about nine miles northeast of Paris, were cordoned off by the police as workers combed the singed fields, trying to identify passenger remains and locate debris from the plane that could provide clues to the cause of the crash. All those on board, mostly German tourists heading to New York to board a luxury cruise, were killed. Four people in the hotel also were killed, and 12 others on the ground were injured, one seriously.</p>
        <p>Wreaths of flowers, placed by mourners, were laid around the area. Bits of wreckage were scattered far and wide.</p>
        <p>Christianne Turpin, the owner of a Shell station 500 yards down the road, had one blackened chunk tucked behind her cash register. She said she had found it by her diesel pump. Ms. Turpin said she had owned the gas station for 23 years and had never worried before about being near an airport.</p>
        <p>''I have to tell you I'm thinking about it now,'' she said. ''It will be on my mind every day from now on.''</p>
        <p>Air France continued the indefinite grounding of its elegant, needle-nosed jets, planes often used by celebrities willing to pay nearly $11,000 round-trip to cross the Atlantic in three and half hours, half the time of other commercial airliners.</p>
        <p>However, British Airways -- the only other airline to fly Concordes -- resumed its normal service today after getting preliminary information from crash investigators in France and conducting extensive technical checks of the fleet's engines, hydraulic systems and airframes.</p>
        <p>''We believe there is no technical, safety or operational evidence to suggest that Concorde should not operate safely in the future,'' said Mike Fleet, a spokesman for British Air.</p>
        <p>But not all passengers were eager to get on the planes. Bill Boster, a CNBC executive, told The Associated Press that he had exchanged his ticket for a ride on a slower plane. ''I have total confidence in the engineers and the pilot of this Concorde, but I just can't face it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Air France, in its statement, described a series of events before the crash that led to the delay of flight AF4590. The statement said that the pilot who landed the plane in Paris on Monday reported that the jet's reverse thrusters, used to brake the plane, were not functioning.</p>
        <p>The statement said that according to ''technical tolerance authorized by the manufacturers'' the plane could have taken off without being repaired. Under Federal Aviation Administration regulations, which applied since the plane's intended destination on Tuesday was New York, the Concorde had to be capable of landing without thrust reversers in order to make the trip.</p>
        <p>But when the situation was reported to the plane's captain, Christian Marty, he decided that he wanted the repairs made. At that point, a replacement part for the plane was obtained from a ''spare'' Concorde and installed within about 30 minutes. The plane was also delayed by baggage handling problems, the statement said.</p>
        <p>But it did not say whether the repairs could have been connected to the crash, which occurred within minutes of the jet's 4:31 p.m. takeoff.</p>
        <p>The crash was a particular blow to French pride. The Concorde, developed by the French and British in the 1960's, was the world's first supersonic passenger jet in regular service. In more than 20 years of commercial flying, however uneconomical and however noisy, a Concorde had never crashed.</p>
        <p>President Jacques Chirac joined grieving victims for an emotional memorial service in Gonesse late in the day. Families and friends of the passengers, many of whom were retirees, wept and held hands during the 30-minute service. Scores of townspeople also gathered outside the service to show their support.</p>
        <p>At Charles de Gaulle Airport, Air France closed off a passenger terminal usually used for charter flights to make bereavement counseling available to the victims' relatives and friends.</p>
        <p>In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder also attended a service and said his nation was in shock over the disaster.</p>
        <p>A videotape shown on France's LCI news station, apparently shot by a Spanish truck driver, shows that the left side of the plane was engulfed in flames long before it even hit the ground. But witnesses said they heard a series of explosions after the crash and a huge plume of black smoke rose into the air.</p>
        <p>One of guests in the 40-room hotel, the Hotelissimo, managed to escape with minor injuries by jumping from her first floor window.</p>
        <p>The guest, Alice Brookings, 21, a British student, said she heard a noise growing louder and louder and then felt the whole building shake as the plane hit the back side of the hotel. When she opened her door, flames leapt into the room. The only way out was the window.</p>
        <p>''I was very, very lucky,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In recent days, inspectors had found tiny cracks in more than half of the 13 Concordes in service in both the French and the British fleets. But the airline has already ruled out any link between the crash and those cracks.</p>
        <p>French officials said they had opened at least two investigations into the crash -- one the equivalent of a criminal investigation, another the official accident investigation.</p>
        <p>At a late afternoon news conference, Mr. Gayssot, the transport minister, said that officials had not finished examining the plane's black boxes and would not disclose any details until Thursday. But like Ms. Senot, he said the investigation was focusing on the engine problems.</p>
        <p>Also at the news conference, Pierre Graff, the director general of civil aviation, warned that the conclusions of the technical investigation might not bear out the account given by Ms. Senot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gayssot also said he wanted a series of meetings and technical consultations before he would put the French Concordes back in service. But he said the planes were far from ready for the scrap heap. ''The Concorde represents the technology of the future and of modernity,'' he said. ''Supersonic technology is still the technology of the future.''</p>
        <p>Ninety-six of the passengers on board the Concorde were from Germany -- 13 from the town of Monchengladbach, on the border with the Netherlands. The flight had been chartered by a German tour operator to take the passengers to New York to join a 15-day cruise to the Caribbean, through the Panama Canal and on to Ecuador.</p>
        <p>There were also two Danes, one Austrian and one American. The American was a retired Air France employee, but the company has not yet disclosed a name. The victims on the ground included two Polish employees of the hotel, a British tourist and a French woman.</p>
        <p>Late in the day, authorities said they had recovered 105 bodies from the site. But they said identifying them would be long and difficult.</p>
