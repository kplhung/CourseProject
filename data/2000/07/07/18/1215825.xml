        <p>Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia, a top Senate Republican leader, underwent brain surgery for a cerebral hemorrhage today.</p>
        <p>The operation, which relieved pressure caused by the bleeding, was performed by Dr. Gary Gropper at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta, Mr. Coverdell's hometown. Dr. Gropper described the two-hour procedure as a success but said it was still unclear whether the 61-year-old senator would experience any lasting effects from the hemorrhage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coverdell is in serious condition and will remain in the intensive care unit.</p>
        <p>''I think over the next 48 hours we'll have a better idea how he's doing,'' Dr. Gropper said at a hospital news conference where he was joined by Senator Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, a heart surgeon who is a close friend of Mr. Coverdell.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coverdell arrived at the hospital on Saturday evening after severe headaches. Tests found the hemorrhage, in his temporal lobe, and doctors ordered the surgery today after his condition deteriorated.</p>
        <p>A hospital spokeswoman, Nina Montanaro, said Mr. Coverdell did not lose consciousness or suffer any seizures that she knew of before the surgery.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued this afternoon, immediately after the operation, Mr. Coverdell's office said, ''The doctors were successful in accomplishing their objective -- the hemorrhage has been stabilized.''</p>
        <p>The industrious and self-effacing Mr. Coverdell was elected to the Senate in 1992 and quickly climbed the ranks of the Republican leadership. He is now secretary of the Republican conference, No. 4 among the leadership, and a confidant of the majority leader, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi. Before coming to Capitol Hill, he was a longtime minority leader of the Georgia Senate, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party and director of the Peace Corps.</p>
        <p>''I don't know of any senator who works any harder or has a more indomitable spirit,'' Mr. Lott said on the Senate floor today. ''Our thoughts and our prayers are with him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Coverdell is also Senate liaison for Gov. George W. Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, and had spent the last few weeks preparing for the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.</p>
