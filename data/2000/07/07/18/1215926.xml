        <p>Lenny Harris has not been playing much for the Mets. But he has watched his teammates closely, and his 13 years of major league experience give him a perspective few have. Harris's conclusion: the Mets were lifeless.</p>
        <p>''It's been dead around here lately,'' said Harris, who had three hits and two stolen bases tonight in the Mets' 7-5 victory in 11 innings over the Toronto Blue Jays. ''I just wanted to motivate the guys and say, 'Hey, we can't wait for Piazza to hit these dramatic home runs every night.' We have to keep going as a team.''</p>
        <p>Harris was starting at third base, a spot usually held by Robin Ventura, who went on the disabled list this week with a bruised shoulder. Ventura's injury gave the Mets another reason to feel sorry for themselves, Harris said, and in losing 9 of 12 games before tonight, a losing attitude had spread.</p>
        <p>''I was watching it,'' Harris said. ''We were getting used to losing around here. You can tell -- it wasn't there, and I know this team better than that.''</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine said he read the team's mood a little differently, but like Harris, he detected that something was wrong. Before the game, Valentine called a team meeting. Valentine has not often seen such meetings work, he said, and a manager has to pick his spots. Sunday night, Valentine decided that today would be an appropriate spot.</p>
        <p>''Suffice it to say, in the last 10 days or two weeks, there's been a lot of thoughts that are not thoughts of reality,'' Valentine said. ''And I wanted to stress the reality of our situation -- and that's that we're a good team.''</p>
        <p>Valentine's address lasted just a few minutes, but the message sank in immediately.</p>
        <p>''He just told everyone to relax and don't worry about things you can't control,'' said John Franco, the fourth of five Mets relief pitchers who held the Blue Jays scoreless with six no-hit innings tonight. ''We just have to go out there and play.</p>
        <p>''The last two weeks, we haven't really played bad; we just haven't gotten the big hit or the big out when we needed it. The pitching's been fine, the hitting's been here or there, but you lose Robin and Darryl Hamilton, it's tough. If we're going to do this and win, all 25 guys have to contribute.''</p>
        <p>That statement is a baseball cliche, but the Mets proved the truth in it during the game.</p>
        <p>Harris was batting .091 for the Mets before the game, but Valentine batted him leadoff to take some of the burden off Melvin Mora, who has been balancing two demanding tasks -- starting shortstop and leadoff man -- in his first stretch as an everyday player. Harris responded by becoming the first Met this season to steal two bases in a game.</p>
        <p>Joe McEwing got a rare start and drove in three runs, two coming on a mammoth homer that hit high off the left-field foul pole and drew comparisons to his St. Louis teammate from last year, Mark McGwire. ''Little Mac almost went into Big Mac territory,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Derek Bell, who was 1 for 21 in the second half and behind in the count, 0-2, when he came to bat with Harris on second and two outs in the eighth, ripped a run-scoring single to tie the score at 5-5. Bell later came back from 0-2 to walk in the 11th inning.</p>
        <p>Then there was the bullpen, which has been inconsistent all season. Starter Rick Reed came off the disabled list from a broken left wrist and had an erratic return, working five innings, allowing five runs on five hits and issuing five walks, which matched his career high. But Pat Mahomes, Dennis Cook, Turk Wendell, Franco and Armando Benitez kept the Blue Jays down and allowed the Mets to come back from a 5-2 deficit.</p>
        <p>Mike Piazza completed the comeback with a run-scoring fielder's choice grounder in the 11th, and Todd Zeile followed with a run-scoring single.</p>
        <p>''Tonight just shows what we can do if everyone gets on a roll together,'' Franco said of the bullpen. ''We can shut teams down. This is what we did last year. That's why we were so successful.''</p>
        <p>With the Braves' loss, the Mets picked up a game in the National League East standing and are now five games behind. It isn't much, but it's a start. And if the Mets get hot from here, today's meeting will get part of the credit.</p>
        <p>''It's good that we had the meeting today so it wouldn't feel like we were closing the tents up,'' Harris said. ''Guys were walking with their heads down. It seems like guys were getting used to losing. We're here to help the team win.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Center fielder DARRYL HAMILTON left the team to work out with a personal trainer at his home in Texas. Hamilton has been out with a toe injury since early April and will spend two weeks at home. ''The last thing he told me,'' Manager BOBBY VALENTINE said, ''was he's definitely coming back this season.'' . . . According to the Society for American Baseball Research, Mets pitcher AL LEITER gave up his first career grand slam in 1988, then worked about 1,300 innings before allowing another, to the Dodgers' SHAWN GREEN this May. On Sunday, just 70 innings after Green connected, Leiter gave up another grand slam, to the Blue Jays' MARTY CORDOVA. . . . The first-year umpire Leiter criticized after Sunday's game, MIKE FICHTER, was replaced by PAUL SCHRIEBER on Monday. . . . The Mets promoted two top prospects, outfielder BRIAN COLE (54 stolen bases) and pitcher PAT STRANGE  (10-1), from Class A St. Lucie to Class AA Binghamton.</p>
