        <p>A dozen Pakistani men from New Jersey, some in the gauzy tunics and pants called shalwar kameez, clambered out of their van at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens. With scrupulous friendliness, they greeted a group of similarly attired men from New York. Forming a double receiving line, they took turns giving each other brief, one-armed hugs and Muslim salutations  before proceeding to a Sunday lunch of halim, a viscous beef stew, scooped up with pieces of flat bread called nan.</p>
        <p>Then they entered the field of battle.</p>
        <p>It was a circular, fenced-in area intended (and F.A.A.-approved) for flying model airplanes. These men, though, would fly kites. Not fanciful contraptions of balsa wood designed to swoop gracefully on curtains of wind, but lean fighting kites, with their battle scars patched with Scotch tape and their strings coated with powdered glass, all the better to cut loose the kite of one's opponent.</p>
        <p>After wrapping their hands with duct tape to protect them from the glass, one man from each team began to launch their kites, standing about 200 feet apart. The wind was strong -- one flier estimated it was twice the ideal speed of 9 miles an hour -- and the kites swiftly dwindled to tiny dots in the sky, unspooling up to 1,000 yards of line apiece.</p>
        <p>Tugging on the taut strings, the two men maneuvered their fighters until their strings crossed, and then tried to use friction or speed to snap the enemy's line. When it became clear that a line had been cut, the winning team would give a shout.</p>
        <p>These limousine drivers, business owners and Wall Street consultants learned to ''cut'' kites as children, standing on the rooftops and in the fields of Pakistan. In the last few years, they have rediscovered the custom, meeting on evenings and weekends in the park to compete.</p>
        <p>On an earlier evening, Basit Mian of Jamaica, Queens, had barely gotten all the way out of his convertible Supra before he started flying. ''It's like a sport back in Pakistan,'' he said. ''They don't consider it too good, though. People who don't study, don't go to school, they cut kites.''</p>
        <p>But what was once a juvenile pastime is now a costly hobby. ''People are spending literally hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' Fayyaz Mehmood said proudly. Mr. Mehmood, 38, a convenience store clerk in Trenton who was in Queens to defend his team's earlier victory against New York, pointed out Mohammed Malik, 47, who owns a meatpacking company and is the New Jersey team's captain and principal financier.</p>
        <p>The kites, which are brought over from Pakistan, ordered on the Internet or bought at neighborhood stores, cost $2 to $3 each (a kite that gets cut is usually gone for good; a winning kite often sustains small rips and tears). The glass-coated string costs about $22 a roll. And each team has a macho version of a spinning wheel spindle: a DeWalt power drill that attaches to the spool to rewind the string.</p>
        <p>There are other expenses. The Meadow Kite Flyers carry their kites in blue nylon bags emblazoned with the name of the club. They have traveled to Pakistan, where they helped organize an international competition which they won. Some of them founded the Kite Flying Association of the United States, and members are also stateside contacts for the World Control Board of Kite Flying, based in Pakistan. They boast of the Basant Mala, a festival to be held in the model airplane field on July 28. There will be free food and music from 8 p.m. until the wee hours, thanks to the generosity of members. And the sky will be filled with 5,000 free, ghostly white kites.</p>
        <p>The club members like to think that both their lavish spending and that they are American will help elevate the sport to its proper place in the world pantheon of competitive events. Members even dream of Olympic kite fighting.</p>
        <p>Though kites were invented 2,500 years ago, probably in China, this type of kite fighting is said to have originated in India. The kites are made of simple colored tissue paper and bamboo. Indian fighting kites are diamond shaped, like the kite a child would draw. Pakistanis fly mostly kites shaped like hawks.</p>
        <p>The head-to-head combat rules here are straightforward: the winner is the last kite flying.</p>
        <p>The game is played differently elsewhere. In Japan, kite fighters stand on opposite sides of a river and fly rokkaku, or six-sided kites. In Brazil the piao fighters are shaped like spinning tops. In Thailand, there is no cutting. Instead, kite fighting there is a battle of the sexes, in which the chula, or ''male'' kite, and the pakpao, a smaller ''female'' kite, try to knock each other to the ground.</p>
        <p>Though kite fighting doesn't require much physical exertion, the Pakistani kite cutters show their dedication in other ways. One member of the New York Meadow Kite Flyers took his mother to the airport five hours before her flight to Pakistan in order to make it to the park that afternoon. ''You have to put the effort behind your culture,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Pakistani-Americans were not the only kite cutters in the park that Sunday. While they tallied their scores (it was neck and neck), the parking lot to the north filled with unaffiliated players looking for a pickup game. Most of them were from Afghanistan, where cutting competitions are organized by the government.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, the Pakistanis play down in the field, the Afghans up in the parking lot. But what separates them is not nationality. It is their differing philosophies concerning string.</p>
        <p>Several Pakistani teammates explained that they use manjha, an imported cotton string with a glue and glass coating applied by hand. American kite-flying groups, who have modified kite fighting into a series of symbolic maneuvers with no cutting, frown on glass-coated strings, saying that they are a safety hazard. Although the string feels like rough sandpaper and does indeed cut unprotected skin, Sheryar Choudhry, a kite fighter from Queens, later insisted that glass coating was no longer used.</p>
        <p>The Afghans prefer ''chemical line,'' which is much like fishing line, and which the Pakistanis say is dangerous and has been outlawed in their home country. Some people said chemical line, too, was glass-coated, while others said it was soaked in an acidic chemical that could inflict easily infected wounds.</p>
        <p>Whatever the truth is, one thing is certain: cotton can't compete with fishing line. ''The lack of communication with the Afghanis is due to the fact that they refuse to use the cotton thread,'' said Mr. Choudhry, 29.</p>
        <p>There's also a difference in kite style. Afghans fly diamond-shaped kites that are smaller and nimbler. ''When it comes to battle, they're unbeatable,'' said Habib Atamy, 32, an Afghan coffee vendor who lives in Whitestone, Queens, and was out in the lot with his brother-in-law. ''The Pakistani kite, it's heavier and it goes down quicker.''</p>
        <p>Assadula Nassari, 29, smiled as he got help untangling his kite string. ''We are homeless,'' he said, thinking of Afghanistan, ''though thank God we are not friendless.''</p>
        <p>Bobby Singh and his turbaned father, K. Singh, had learned of kite cutting in the park by watching the Indian cable channel in New York. The elder Mr. Singh took his son out to experience what had been a favorite game in his youth in Punjab. His son, who had just finished medical school, brushed aside a warning about the Afghan's chemical line, saying, ''Give me a chance.''</p>
        <p>Minutes later, after losing two kites, his bravado had wilted. ''He has a fishing line,'' he complained. ''You can't break that!''</p>
        <p>The men stayed well into the evening, losing kite after kite to the wind. But one person profited from their losses. Fahamida Nusrat, a 10-year-old girl from Bangladesh, tugged a kite down from a tree. It was, miraculously, intact. As her parents sat on a blanket nearby, she carefully wrapped the kite string around an empty water bottle and stood in the grass alone, trying to coax her prize aloft.</p>
