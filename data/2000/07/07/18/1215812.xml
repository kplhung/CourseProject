        <p>A national organization of Roman Catholic priests will announce a campaign today to urge voters to make opposition to abortion their first priority in choosing candidates to support in the elections this fall.</p>
        <p>The organization, Priests for Life, will make its case with advertisements in newspapers and on television, according to its national director, the Rev. Frank A. Pavone of the Archdiocese of New York. The organization has scheduled a news conference today in Washington.</p>
        <p>Priests for Life will not endorse candidates or support a particular party, Father Pavone said, but will aim part of its message at politicians who support abortion rights, to try to persuade them to reconsider.</p>
        <p>The organization, he said, draws its inspiration for the campaign from a statement adopted by the nation's Catholic bishops in November 1998. That statement, ''Living the Gospel of Life: A Challenge to American Catholics,'' described abortion and euthanasia as grave threats to civil society and said political leaders have a moral obligation to combat them.</p>
        <p>Among the scripts for three television commercials the organization plans to film, one calls for Father Pavone to quote from the bishops' statement, urging lawmakers who support abortion rights to ''consider the consequences for their own spiritual well-being, as well as the scandal they risk by leading others into serious sin.''</p>
        <p>According to the script, the commercial is addressed to abortion rights supporters generally and does not name any specific politicians.</p>
        <p>In the script of another commercial, addressed to voters, Father Pavone calls abortion ''the most important issue'' of the political season.</p>
        <p>Father Pavone said the commercials might be broadcast by late August. He also said the organization wanted to speak not just to Catholics, but to non-Catholics as well, urging all to be informed about the election. ''I want the public to understand abortion as it is, as an act of violence,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Founded nine years ago, Priests for Life has about 6,000 priests and 40,000 lay people as members, said Father Pavone, who was given permission to become its national director by the late Cardinal John O'Connor, Archbishop of New York. He said it had an annual budget of $4 million, raised through donations.</p>
        <p>Its advisory board includes prelates like Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo, president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for the Family, Archbishop Charles J. Chaput of Denver and Archbishop John F. Donoghue of Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Priests for Life's plans have drawn the attention of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, of Washington, whose executive director, the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, said that if the organization singled out specific races or candidates with its message, the advertisements would violate what the government allowed religious organizations to do.</p>
        <p>''If it's clear that it's a specific, unlawful intervention'' in a political race, Mr. Lynn said, ''we will report it to the Internal Revenue Service.''</p>
        <p>But Anthony DeStefano, Priests for Life's executive director, said the organization would steer clear of such involvement.</p>
        <p>''We have been very thorough, not only in consulting our own law firm, but legal experts in the pro-life movement and in the church,'' Mr. DeStefano said. ''We're on very, very solid ground. We're not going to be endorsing or attacking any candidates by name, period.''</p>
