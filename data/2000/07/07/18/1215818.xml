        <p>Editorial backs recommendation by SEC chairman, Arthur Levitt, for independent audits of corporate financial statements, which has drawn heavy resistance from accounting profession</p>

        <p>Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, would not appear to be asking for very much. He wants independent audits of corporate financial statements to be just that, independent. Yet his seemingly innocuous proposals aimed at guaranteeing independence are drawing heavy resistance from the accounting profession and, because the industry is rich and powerful, from Capitol Hill. Ordinary investors should pull for Mr. Levitt to win this struggle because the rules he has proposed are calibrated to protect their financial interests.</p>
        <p>By law, public corporations hire outside auditors each year to examine their financial statements. The idea is to reassure investors that corporate reports on earnings and other measures of financial health have been prepared according to professional standards. Recently, public confidence in these outside audits has been shaken by a number of explosive financial crises. Investors lost a lot of money, in part because they relied on fraudulent or misleading financial reports issued by companies and certified by their auditors.</p>
        <p>But beyond the corporate failures is the insidious appearance of a conflict of interest. Accounting firms increasingly perform lucrative consulting services for companies they audit. The commission is now asking whether this relationship creates an unhealthy incentive for accounting firms to perform less aggressive audits. In some recent cases where a company's financial condition turned out to be much worse than investors had been told, the accounting firm that performed the errant audit had also provided its client with substantial non-audit services. Is there proof that the non-auditing work caused auditors to wink at impropriety? No. But suspicions lurk.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. has now issued new rules for public comment and possible adoption by the end of the year that address those suspicions. The proposed rules would solidify two principles. One is that auditors should not own stock in the companies they audit. The second is that an accounting firm should not be allowed to audit other services provided by the same firm.</p>
        <p>Toward those ends, the proposed rules would require auditors to disclose non-auditing services they provide their clients and would prohibit auditors from doing external audits for companies for which they also provide internal audits. The new rules would also prohibit accounting firms from designing computer systems that generate financial statements for companies they audit.</p>
        <p>Three of the five major accounting firms oppose the chairman's efforts. So does the major association of public accountants. Several members of Congress from both houses have sent letters to the chairman questioning the need for the proposed rules. But Mr. Levitt is right to proceed. Investor confidence requires not only the absence of conflicts of interest but the absence of the appearance of such conflicts.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. has proposed nothing draconian, only common-sense rules to make sure that outside auditors perform and appear to perform independent audits. For that the chairman deserves Congress's enthusiastic support.</p>
