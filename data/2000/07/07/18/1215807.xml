        <p>ABC will begin a campaign for its fall lineup that seems intent on all but stalking viewers, forcing them to be aware of ABC shows in almost every waking moment of their lives -- when they withdraw cash from an A.T.M., shop in the supermarket or use the urinal at the local bar and grill.</p>
        <p>And if the network does not find viewers in those places, it may leave a message about its new comedy, ''Madigan Men,'' starring Gabriel Byrne, waiting on their answering machines when they come home.</p>
        <p>ABC, part of the Walt Disney Company, is the network that has promoted itself for several years with ads described by Madison Avenue as ''the yellow campaign,'' after the predominant color of the TV and print pitches. For the 2000-01 season, ABC is changing its theme from ''America's broadcasting company,'' used during the 1999-2000 season, to ''ABC . . . definitely.''</p>
        <p>Originally, the ''yellow'' ads, which sought to create an identity for the entire network as well as encourage viewership of specific shows, were derided, but they have eventually gained widespread recognition.</p>
        <p>Among the elements of the new campaign are a tie-in with KFC restaurants, where yellow ABC promotions will be wrapped around seven million buckets of fried chicken; floor ads in supermarkets with yellow ABC squares promoting shows; and yellow placards on bank machines with Regis Philbin of ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' using lines like, ''It's a shame you can't withdraw more.''</p>
        <p>But surely the parts of the campaign, created in-house, that will draw the most attention are the decision to call viewers at home in the 10 biggest cities, leaving messages to watch the ABC Friday night lineup of comedies, and the plan to display pictures of Norm MacDonald of the comedy ''Norm'' behind urinals in New York and Los Angeles, with catchy copy phrases like ''Another fine use of the color yellow.'' Meanwhile, a motion-activated device will crank up his voice uttering invitations to watch his series between comments appropriate to the locations like, ''Hey, watch your shoes!''</p>
        <p>Michael Benson, the senior vice president for marketing at ABC, said the network believed the yellow campaign had made ABC ''the most recognized brand in television.'' The new campaign is designed to reinforce the playful image of ABC's promotions, he added, as well as what he called ''our uniqueness.''</p>
        <p>In the past, ABC has placed ads on the tops of taxi cabs and in the sand on beaches as well as in unexpected places like candy bowls at restaurants, as well as on bus benches and pizza boxes.</p>
        <p>The urinal ads are the work of Los Angeles-based Zoom Media, which has been posting ads and promotions in bathrooms for 10 years. Zoom sells ads in about 15 cities in the United States and Canada, with signs in stalls in women's bathrooms and behind urinals in men's rooms. (ABC is sticking to men's rooms, at least for the moment.) The ads are mainly aimed at young adults between 18 and 35, and thus are concentrated in places like bars, nightclubs and health clubs.</p>
        <p>ABC plans on running the urinal ads only in New York and Los Angeles, according to Alan Cohen, executive vice president for marketing and advertising at ABC. They will start about four weeks before the new episodes of ''Norm'' appear, which is now expected to be in October, he said.</p>
        <p>As for the plan to call viewers at home to push ''Madigan Men,'' Mr. Cohen said that ABC would use a form of technology that only activates when it reaches an answering machine. Thus if someone actually picks up the phone, the lines will go dead -- just the way your average movie stalker might do.</p>
        <p>Asked if that does not qualify as overt harassment, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Benson defended the plan by saying that they would be, in Mr. Cohen's words, ''sensitive about it if we get that kind of feedback,'' adding ''we are certainly open to hearing consumers' comments.'' Mr. Cohen specified he meant feedback in the form of calls and e-mails from viewers, not comments from reporters.</p>
        <p>''We don't see it as harassing,'' Mr. Cohen said, adding that it was merely another step in the aggressive ''brand campaign that got us noticed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Benson said of the overall campaign, ''We like to find unique ways to talk to people.''</p>
