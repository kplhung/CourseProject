        <p>The news seemed breathtaking. An Alzheimer's vaccine that had previously worked in mice now seemed safe in patients. Many newspapers ran enthusiastic articles; some even put the news on their front pages, signaling that it was among the most important events of the day. Radio and television programs were even more upbeat, hinting strongly that help was on the way for the four million Americans with Alzheimer's.</p>
        <p>But the eager reporting raises difficult questions of what to say about medical advances and when to say it.</p>
        <p>The vaccine itself was exciting. But that news came a year ago in an article in the journal Nature. Scientists then reported they had injected mice with a protein that accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients and is thought to lead to the widespread death of brain cells, resulting in symptoms like loss of memory and of the ability to reason and think. Mice do not get the disease, but these animals had been genetically engineered to make large quantities of the aberrant protein, beta amyloid, which accumulated in their brains.</p>
        <p>When the scientists from Elan Pharmaceuticals in San Francisco gave mice the vaccine, the animals produced antibodies that blocked the accumulation of beta amyloid in their brains, and it even seemed to help clean up some that had already accumulated. It was, in a sense, proof of a principle illustrating that the immune system of mice, when properly primed, could attack the dangerous Alzheimer's proteins in the brain.</p>
        <p>That research also marked the start of an orderly process to determine objectively whether a new treatment was safe and effective. When animal studies are completed, the next major step is to ask what happens in patients.</p>
        <p>Safety studies come first, with so-called Phase 1 studies that are not meant to show effectiveness, but any worrisome or alarming adverse reactions to the treatment. Patients are given increasing doses of the drugs while scientists monitor side effects. After Phase 1 are the much larger studies, involving hundreds or thousands of patients, to ascertain if a drug is effective.</p>
        <p>According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group that represents large drug companies, four out of five drugs that enter Phase 1 never make it to market, failing because they are too toxic or turn out to be ineffective.</p>
        <p>The recent news about the Alzheimer's vaccine came from the start of a Phase 1 study -- not even a completed study -- just preliminary results on two dozen patients who had received a single dose of the vaccine. All that could be said was that it appeared to be safe, so far.</p>
        <p>Dr. James E. Barrett, vice president for neuroscience at Wyeth-Ayerst Research, American Home Products' pharmaceutical research unit, said his company was working with Elan to test the vaccine. The Phase 1 study, Dr. Barrett said, will include about 100 Alzheimer's patients and will test several doses. If this treatment is not too dangerous, efficacy studies will begin involving hundreds of patients.</p>
        <p>The news release on the first two dozen people to enter the vaccine safety study came from the Alzheimer's Association, an advocacy group, at the World Alzheimer Congress 2000 meeting last week in Washington. Dr. William Thies, the association's vice president for medical and scientific affairs, said: ''The attraction of this whole business for us is that this is essentially a new approach. There is tremendous interest in it.'' But Dr. Thies added that the clinical research was in its earliest stages. ''We all know there is a potential for any of these products to be derailed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One measure of the importance of data from research studies is whether they are published or accepted for publication. Dr. Barrett said American Home Products would not consider trying to publish the safety results on two dozen patients in a medical journal. ''I'm not sure what you would publish,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The question for journalists and the public is, What makes research news? Is it a paper in a prestigious journal on animal studies? Is it a report on the first few patients to receive a treatment in a Phase 1 study, publicized at a meeting? Is it the result of much larger study asking if the treatment is effective?</p>
        <p>The families of Alzheimer's patients may want to know everything of interest, as soon as it happens. But medical experts say they worry about creating false hopes, followed by cynicism if, as history shows is extremely likely, a drug or treatment that is being tested in a Phase 1 study never makes it to the market.</p>
