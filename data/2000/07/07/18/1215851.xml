        <p>Usually, when hail descends on the picturesque apple orchards of the Hudson Valley, it strikes fitfully, wreaking havoc on a farmer's field of Empires, say, but sparing his McIntoshes. But this spring's hail was different.</p>
        <p>Two storms pelted newly formed apples with jagged balls of ice on more than 7,000 acres, and as the apples have grown, the tiny bruises have turned into ugly divots. Two thousand of those acres were so badly hurt that farmers are abandoning them entirely this season. In all, some 2.09 million bushels, about a third of the crop, are expected to be lost in what farmers say is the worst crop damage in memory.</p>
        <p>''The wind was so strong that it drove the hail into the apples like bullets,'' said Jeffrey D. Crist, a fourth-generation apple grower who said he had no choice but to let the deformed apples in his orchard here drop to the ground this fall.</p>
        <p>In earlier times, apple farmers would curse Mother Nature and hope for better luck next year. But a number of economic forces -- from depressed prices resulting from a worldwide glut of apples to spotty insurance coverage to demands for flawless fruit -- have pushed the Hudson Valley farmers to the brink. Many are wondering aloud whether the 10-minute hail bursts in May and June will be the straws that finally break them -- and in the process alter an austere landscape of gnarled trees and open sky forever.</p>
        <p>Indeed, as the apple growers band together to ask the federal government for direct cash assistance of $20 million to cover their losses, they are talking as much about open space and suburban sprawl as about agriculture, speaking a language that resonates with politicians, tourists and the many owners of weekend houses here in Ulster County, the second largest apple-producing county in a state that is second only to Washington in apple production.</p>
        <p>A dozen or so farmers met this month with Representative Benjamin A. Gilman in an orchard in Orange County south of Milton, a hamlet just west of the Hudson about 70 miles north of Midtown Manhattan. The growers evoked a potential consequence of their financial crisis in apple-producing counties like Ulster, Orange, Columbia and Dutchess, where a wave of new building has swept through in the last decade.</p>
        <p>''Do we just go home and call our Realtor or do we hang in there?'' Roderick Dressel of Dressel Farms in New Paltz asked on a crisp, breezy day that felt like fall. ''We're asking for a one-time Band-Aid to keep our industry going, to preserve open space and to prevent it from all going to traffic and septic tanks.''</p>
        <p>In 1985, 104 farms covered 11,629 acres in Ulster County. By 1996, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the number of farms had fallen to 63 on 8,632 acres. The decisions now being made by apple growers like Anthony Porpiglia could accelerate the trend. Having lost 60 percent of his apple crop to the May 18 hailstorm in Ulster County, Mr. Porpiglia says he cannot borrow money, even at the low interest rates available to farmers in a declared disaster area. Instead, he is looking to one of his eight orchards to make him whole.</p>
        <p>''Our debt load is tremendous, and we don't want to get any deeper,'' Mr. Porpiglia said. ''We have an orchard -- 35 acres in Ulster Park in the middle of a development. We're thinking of selling it. It's a valuable piece of land.''</p>
        <p>Experts in farming practices say that when more than a third of the apples in an orchard are damaged, it does not pay to harvest the remaining good ones.</p>
        <p>''The pickers are paid based on volume and there's really no way to slow a picker down so that he would turn over each piece of fruit and examine it, said Michael J. Fargione, an educator with Cornell Cooperative Extension, a program of Cornell University that provides research information and educational programs to farmers. ''Even a small ding is enough to have that fruit rejected by a grocery chain.''</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki asked the United States Department of Agriculture on June 18 to declare large sections of the Hudson Valley a disaster area, as well as some two dozen counties across the state where heavy rains damaged a number of other crops. But the federal agency has yet to do so.</p>
        <p>Many farmers say they would not be eligible for the low-interest loans available through the disaster program anyway. Farmers must first be turned down by their regular lenders in order to qualify for loans, but banks are more than happy to lend to growers who have ample collateral in the form of valuable land.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, farmers who carried hail insurance are having a tough time collecting on their claims. The insurers argue that hail-damaged fruit can still be used for the juice market. But the juice market is so weak that the cost of harvesting the bruised apples would exceed the price paid for the fruit.</p>
        <p>''The cider market is $1.20 a bushel and it costs $4 a bushel to pick it,'' said Russ Bartolotta Jr. of Klein's Kill Fruit Farms in Germantown, N.Y., across the Hudson River in Columbia County. ''Economically, you're committing suicide to go in there and try to salvage. You're going to throw good money after bad.''</p>
        <p>A bushel of apples sold for fresh fruit rather than juice would have brought a farmer $6 in 1995. Today, the same bushel brings $3.50, apple growers say. Farmers say, too, that walking away from an apple orchard for a season does not free them from maintaining it. ''You still have to mow and trim the orchards and spray so certain insects and fungus don't get in there,'' said Mr. Bartolotta, who estimates that 90 percent of the apple crop was ruined on his family's 320 acres of orchards. ''There are things you have to keep doing so next year's crop won't be affected.''</p>
        <p>A few factors have made apple farmers in New York State particularly vulnerable to a setback like hail damage. The apple industry has suffered from depressed prices in recent years, the result of a worldwide overproduction of apples and exports of cheap apple-juice concentrate to the United States from China. In addition, a key export market for the United States -- Southeast Asia -- wilted after the economic crisis there. And the continuing consolidation among retailers has strengthened the hand of stores in demanding lower prices from farmers.</p>
        <p>Industry experts say that this year's hail damage should not affect consumer prices because of the general oversupply of apples from across the United States and abroad.</p>
        <p>The apple farmers now find themselves in the role of activists, organizing meetings, faxing fact sheets, collaring any politician who will listen. When Representative Gilman, a Republican, came for his tour here, there was a table set up alongside the orchard with the evidence: tree branches from other farms bearing pockmarked fruit. ''We're doing things we're not accustomed to doing,'' said Mr. Crist, who counts 150 of his 600 acres of apples a complete loss.</p>
        <p>Legislation is pending in Congress that would provide $115 million to apple farmers nationwide to compensate them for market losses and crop damage from previous years. In June, President Clinton signed the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, a $15 billion relief package for producers of a variety of crops that will, among other things, reduce the cost of crop insurance. But how much of that money will eventually make its way to the Hudson Valley, where Hurricane Floyd caused damage last fall, is uncertain. And none of the money would offset the losses from this spring's hail.</p>
        <p>Steve Clarke, a 55-year-old apple grower whose family farm dates to 1817, knows the global economics of apple production as well as anyone, but he is now focused on his own finances. Still farming alongside his 82-year-old father, Leonard Clarke, and bringing along his 24-year-old son, Brad, Mr. Clarke has 60 acres of useless apples outside his front door here -- half his apple crop.</p>
        <p>He says he will have to borrow $50,000 to $60,000 to maintain his orchards, pay his bills and meet his payroll. ''We don't have the reserve or cushion to say we're going to take it out of that,'' Mr. Clarke said. ''The business just hasn't been that good the last four years. Ten minutes of hail is going to cost me about three years of my life.''</p>
        <p>Like other apple farmers in the Hudson Valley, Mr. Clarke is asking for an emergency infusion of cash from the federal government, assistance that Mr. Gilman said he would try to get. In asking for that subsidy, Mr. Clarke is unabashedly tapping fears that open land north of New York City is quickly disappearing to development.</p>
        <p>''We're just at the very reaches of commuting from New York City and as Orange County fills up and Dutchess fills up, there are going to be more pressures on the land,'' he said. ''Are people willing to pay to maintain open space? That's something that needs to be debated.''</p>
