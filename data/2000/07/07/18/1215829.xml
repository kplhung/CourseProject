        <p>With the Republican National Convention two weeks away, Gov. George W. Bush began trying to build excitement about it today in his playful, teasing manner, saying for the first time that he was closing in on his selection of a running mate and letting his advisers dribble out details about a five-day trip he would make to the event.</p>
        <p>At a news conference this morning in Little Rock, Ark., where he campaigned before heading here, Mr. Bush said he could no longer pretend that he was not busily winnowing the field of vice-presidential possibilities.</p>
        <p>''The days of saying the list is shrinking and growing are over,'' Mr. Bush said with a broad smile, referring to the coy refrain he had used until this point to answer questions about his deliberations. ''I'm getting closer to a decision.''</p>
        <p>The Texas governor shed no light on what that decision would be, but the possible timing of it was made clearer in the details that his advisers released about the trip Mr. Bush would make to Philadelphia, where the four-day convention begins on July 31.</p>
        <p>Karen P. Hughes, the director of communications for the Bush campaign, said the candidate would leave Austin, Tex., on July 28 and arrive in Philadelphia on Aug. 2, the day before he is expected to formally receive his party's presidential nomination and make his convention speech.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes also said Mr. Bush would probably introduce his running mate in Austin, which suggested that the announcement would come just before he was scheduled to leave town, perhaps in the middle of next week. But she added that nothing was confirmed and that Mr. Bush still had not decided when he would make the announcement.</p>
        <p>The route that he will take to the convention, making stops along the way, will go from Texas to Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and, finally, Pennsylvania, Ms. Hughes said.</p>
        <p>She noted that the Republican presidential nominee had not won any of those states between Texas and Pennsylvania since 1988 but that Mr. Bush believed he could prevail in most or all of them. Ms. Hughes said other states could be added to the trip.</p>
        <p>At his news conference today, Mr. Bush also repeated a promise he and his advisers had made: that the Republican convention would look, feel and sound unlike previous ones.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a convention that is going to have some new wrinkles to it,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>He was referring to plans to devote each night to a different theme, to keep the oratory generally upbeat, and to skip the practice of devoting one night to attacks on the other major party's nominee.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the convention, several of Mr. Bush's advisers said today, the Texas governor would probably travel by train for several days of whistle-stop campaigning.</p>
        <p>Both Republicans and Democrats, whose national convention will be in mid-August, are working to make the spotlight that these events throw on the political parties and their presidential nominees last as long as possible and matter as much as possible. Vice President Al Gore is expected to include a boat trip through key states in the Midwest after the Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Bush's news conference in Little Rock, he unveiled a modest proposal designed to cast himself as an especially compassionate conservative, and he discussed it briefly at a private social services agency where he was flanked by African-Americans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said that if he were elected president, he would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to encourage states to set up registries for the fathers of children born out of wedlock, but he did not call for new federal spending to be directed explicitly toward that effort.</p>
        <p>He started such a registry in Texas in 1997, and he said it served one of two benefits: either encouraging fathers to take responsibility for their children, or making it easier, if those fathers chose not to do that, to have their children adopted.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Bush campaigned in Arkansas and Wisconsin today, he also continued to raise money for the Republican Party, bringing in an estimated $1.4 million at four events.</p>
