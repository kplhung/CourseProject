        <p>David Cone wanted the baseball last night even before the national anthem at Yankee Stadium. Cone's shoulders were hunched, and he looked as if he were walking uphill as he strolled to the mound and waved his glove toward Umpire Mark Hirschbeck. Hirschbeck did not respond and made Cone wait for the ball. The wait only delayed the start of another depressing night.</p>
        <p>Once Cone got the ball, once he dug his cleats into the dirt and tried to get comfortable, everyone stared at him and everyone wondered how he would fare. Cone is a proud and ornery pitcher not accustomed to failure, but this season has disappointed him and caused the doubts and the questions about his future to escalate.</p>
        <p>Cone did little to stem those doubts and questions last night as the Philadelphia Phillies belted two homers off the 37-year-old right-hander, moved out to a 10-4 lead, then held on to win, 10-8. Today is the anniversary of Cone's magical perfect game against the Montreal Expos last season, but aside from Cone's two crucial post-season victories in helping the Yankees to a second straight World Series title, his pitching since last July 18 has been imperfect.</p>
        <p>The drought continued last night as Cone allowed six runs in five innings and lost his sixth straight decision, a career high. It also extended his streak without a victory to a career-worst 12 starts.</p>
        <p>Dwight Gooden is a candidate to replace Cone in the rotation, but Manager Joe Torre stressed that Cone would make his next start. Even Cone wonders how much longer he will receive that loyalty.</p>
        <p>''I'm just not getting it done right now,'' Cone said. ''One way or another, this has got to stop. Either I pitch my way out of here or I'm going to turn it around. One way or another, this can't go on.''</p>
        <p>Since Orlando Hernandez is expected to miss his start against the Detroit Tigers tomorrow night because of a sprained right elbow, Cone has a little more time to assert himself and remain in the rotation. Cone stifled the Toronto Blue Jays, 3-0, on April 28, his only victory in a 1-8 season. With the Yankees clinging to a half-game lead over the Jays, how long will Cone's shortened leash be?</p>
        <p>''This can't go on,'' Cone repeated over and over, almost willing himself to end what he called ''a nightmare.''</p>
        <p>After Pat Burrell smashed a slider that was just above his ankles over the center-field fence for a three-run homer in the fifth last night, Cone put his hands on his hips and stared toward the outfield. He looked exasperated, which is how the Yankees felt, too. They felt that way again when Bobby Abreu ripped a grand slam off Jason Grimsley in the seventh to put the Phillies ahead, 10-4.</p>
        <p>Cone retreated to the clubhouse and did not watch the Yankees rally and have the potential tying run at the plate in the ninth. It was Cone's first start in 13 days, and he had allowed ''two enormous bombs,'' meaning he has permitted eight homers in his last three starts.</p>
        <p>''I shouldn't fall off this quickly and this badly,'' Cone said. ''I've just fallen on my face this year and I haven't found the way to get out of it. When you're in a position that you're hurting the team, it really hurts.''</p>
        <p>A subdued Torre searched for positives, explaining how Cone still made some batters miss pitches, how Derek Jeter's misplay at shortstop in the fourth preceded Burrell's homer and how Cone has been buried by a few bad pitches. But even Cone admitted that sounds ''like a broken record'' because the start typified his season.</p>
        <p>''There's no remedy here; no solution or no aspirin can handle this,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>While Cone has struggled, he has rarely had a decent slider. But he used a slider to strike out Kevin Sefcik and Abreu in the first. By the second, Cone was in trouble as he walked Scott Rolen on five pitches and Mike Lieberthal crushed his next pitch into the Phillies' bullpen for a 2-0 lead. Cone lifted his hands above his head, dug around the rubber and kicked his left leg into the air as he waited to resume. His reddened face was filled with a frown.</p>
        <p>Tino Martinez singled off David Coggin to knock in two runs in the third, the second scoring when Bernie Williams leveled catcher Mike Lieberthal at the plate. There was new life for Cone and the Yankees. It did not last.</p>
        <p>Abreu lined a double to right in the fourth and Rolen slapped a grounder to shortstop. Jeter darted to his left and had the roller glance off his glove for what should have been an error, but was ruled a single.</p>
        <p>Tom Prince blooped a single to make it 3-2, and Cone was sweating, trying to keep his team in the game. He tossed a slider that dived under Burrell's knees, but the rookie reached down and drilled the ball about 430 feet.</p>
        <p>''By no means have I given up,'' Cone insisted. ''By no means do I think I'm done. It's not going to end this way. I'm not going to allow it to end this way. Either I turn it around and start helping the team or they make a tough decision and get me out of there.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>JORGE POSADA dropped his appeal of a one-game suspension for fighting with Tampa Bay's BOBBY SMITH on July 1 and served it last night. It was a convenient move because CHRIS TURNER has developed into DAVID CONE's personal catcher and he started in Posada's place. . . . RAMIRO MENDOZA, who is disabled with a weakened right shoulder, will probably begin a rehabilitation assignment tomorrow. . . . DENNY NEAGLE, obtained from Cincinnati last Wednesday, will make his Yankee debut tonight.</p>
