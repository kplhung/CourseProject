        <p>Boris A. Berezovsky, the archetypal Russian tycoon, politician and, until lately, a force within the Kremlin itself, said today that he would quit his seat in Parliament on Wednesday and try to form an alliance of big business and regional politicians aimed at curbing President Vladimir V. Putin's growing power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berezovsky said flatly that he was resigning because ''I do not wish to take part in the dismantling of Russia and the imposition of authoritarian rule.''</p>
        <p>It was the bluntest attack yet by a major figure on the popular Mr. Putin, who has taken dead aim at Russia's business oligarchy and its 89 regional governors in an effort to reimpose Kremlin control over an almost feral political structure.</p>
        <p>It also carried considerable risk for Mr. Berezovsky, a roundly unpopular public figure and one of the very tycoons Mr. Putin's men are sizing up. His plan for a new anti-Kremlin movement drew catcalls when he first hinted at it earlier this month, and most experts give it scant chance of quick success.</p>
        <p>By resigning from Parliament's lower house, the Duma, he will surrender his immunity to criminal prosecution just as the government is threatening criminal action against other tycoons -- and after prosecutors questioned him on Friday in a criminal inquiry involving the Russian airline Aeroflot.</p>
        <p>In a news conference here, Mr. Berezovsky took pains to suggest that he sought to a create a new loyal opposition to a president whose convictions and honesty he still admired. If the presidential election of last March were held today, Mr. Berezovsky said at one point, he would vote for Mr. Putin again.</p>
        <p>But he also sounded like an angry and betrayed man, one who blasted the Kremlin's attacks on his fellow tycoons as nothing more than a bald attempt to usurp power for itself.</p>
        <p>''Today Russia is facing a choice: whether we will follow the Latin American model, with an authoritarian power and market economy, or the European model with a liberal power and market economy,'' he said. ''The only possible option,'' he said, is the latter.</p>
        <p>Russia experts here and in Washington say the events show how swiftly Mr. Berezovsky, who had an open door to the Kremlin during President Boris N. Yeltsin's final years in office, has become estranged from Mr. Putin's administration.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's any relationship between Putin and Berezovsky,'' said Vyacheslav A. Nikonov, a top Russian political analyst. ''Otherwise, Berezovsky wouldn't correspond with Putin by sending him these open letters.'' With his access cut off, he said, Mr. Berezovsky is now reduced to a game of modest opposition.</p>
        <p>''He's sending messages in different directions,'' Mr. Nikhonov said. ''One is to the Kremlin, saying, 'You guys are making a big mistake without me.' Message number two is to the governors: 'I'm your best friend.' And three is to the liberals: 'I'm your last hope for democracy.' ''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Berezovsky, 54, a former mathematician who acquired immense riches by exploiting Russia's lawless capitalism early on, then shielded them with the help of Mr. Yeltsin's Kremlin, seems an unlikely spokesman for democracy.</p>
        <p>He is widely assumed to have vast interests in Aeroflot; Avtovaz, Russia's biggest automaker; and Sibneft, one of the largest oil companies, among others. He denies some of those assumptions but makes no bones about wielding great influence -- and even financial control -- over a media empire that includes Russia's quasi-state television network, ORT, the Moscow business newspaper Kommersant and the magazine Vlast, whose name is Russian for power.</p>
        <p>The incongruity is even richer: Mr. Berezovsky is widely believed to be one of the Kremlin insiders who decided during Mr. Yeltsin's final days in the presidency that Mr. Putin should be groomed to succeed him. ORT played a major role in promoting Mr. Putin's election this spring.</p>
        <p>But then, experts still debate whether the Kremlin's assaults on the governors and the tycoons are aimed at stabilizing Russia's shaky democracy, as Mr. Putin says, or at aggrandizing the president's own power, as Mr. Berezovsky contends.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin, since being sworn in as president in early May, has carved Russia into seven administrative districts and installed his own appointee in each one, moving swiftly to consolidate federal power and patronage in a single place.</p>
        <p>He has also proposed to effectively abolish the upper house of Parliament, which now consists of the 89 governors and their appointees, and replace it with a more independent group of legislators. Over Mr. Berezovsky's strident objections, the Duma seems on the verge of doing just that.</p>
        <p>The Kremlin's war on the tycoons began days after Mr. Putin's swearing-in with a raid on the offices of Vladimir A. Gusinsky, who controls a media empire that includes Russia's largest independent television network.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has denied any involvement in that or moves since then against a half-dozen other oligarchs in the oil, metals and auto industries. But neither has he disavowed them, and it has become apparent in the last week that the actions have his tacit approval, if not his outright authorization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berezovsky said today that federal prosecutors had questioned him for two hours on Friday about allegations that up to $600 million in proceeds from Aeroflot, the privatized Soviet airline, had been laundered through Swiss banks. He insists that the accusations are groundless and that in any case, he is but a witness in a case that centers on other people.</p>
        <p>But news reports quote prosecutors as saying that Mr. Berezovsky, long said to have a huge but hidden interest in Aeroflot, is a target of the inquiry.</p>
        <p>In his news conference today, Mr. Berezovsky said he had decided to quit Parliament in part because he did not believe it right to side with his fellow oligarchs against Mr. Putin while having an immunity from prosecution that they lack.</p>
        <p>The government's attack, he said, is ''no accident, not the initiative of some overzealous bureaucrat.''</p>
        <p>''It is essentially aimed at destroying large independent businesses,'' he said. ''I do not want to enjoy parliamentary immunity in such a case.''</p>
        <p>Some experts, noting that Mr. Berezovsky and other tycoons have usually been major rivals in the last decade, offered a less charitable assessment.</p>
        <p>''He's got to know that if these people want to get him, having parliamentary immunity is not going to make any difference,'' said Paul Saunders, director of the Nixon Center, a Washington-based research organization that specializes in Russian affairs. ''It's just an opportunity to take a fairly high-profile, dramatic step to once and for all make it clear to everyone that he opposes what is happening.''</p>
