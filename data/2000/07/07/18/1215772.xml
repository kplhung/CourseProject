        <p>One is a game show, the other a pseudo survival test on a desert island, but in terms of impact on American culture, ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and CBS's ''Survivor'' qualify as another British invasion.</p>
        <p>Speaking in terms of paternity if not artistry, Michael Davies, the British-born executive producer of ''Millionaire,'' said, ''It's actually a pretty good analogy: 'Millionaire' as the Beatles and 'Survivor' as the Rolling Stones.'' Both ''Millionaire'' and ''Survivor'' are 100 percent British-made television ideas, and Mr. Davies had a hand in bringing both shows to American audiences.</p>
        <p>They are also providing a bit of cultural revenge for the British, who have lately felt disrespected and mistreated by American films like ''The Patriot'' and ''U-571.''</p>
        <p>The story of ''Millionaire'' has been widely told in the last year as that game show has gradually colonized much of prime time. ''Millionaire,'' turned down for two years by the ITV network in Britain, went on the air there in late 1998 and was an instant hit. But it was the expansion to the United States and myriad other outposts that stamped the show as possibly England's most successful cultural export in the last 30 years.</p>
        <p>''It's a bit like the old days of the British empire,'' said Paul Smith, managing director of the British production company Celador, which came up with the game show. ''We've got a map of the world in the office colored in pink where we've placed the show. Most of the world is pink.''</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' is the scruffier newcomer, and its roots are less well known, largely because the show never got onto British television. Instead ''Survivor'' went through one of the longest gestation periods of any breakthrough television show. It took 12 years, during which it was rejected by every network in Britain and two in the United States, before it finally emerged into the relative obscurity of Swedish television.</p>
        <p>The show made it principally because of the commitment of its creative team, a threesome that includes an Irish rock singer, the leading producer of what the British press call ''yoof TV'' (as in ''Youth TV'') and the youngest life peer in the House of Lords.</p>
        <p>The latter, surely the first member of the House of Lords to bring a hit television show to American television, is Waheed Alli, 35. Lord Alli was the principal business executive of Planet 24, a television production company responsible for often controversial but usually successful British shows. These included ''The Big Breakfast,'' in which the anchor, Paula Yates, often interviewed guests from her bed; ''The Word,'' a music- and occasionally raunch-filled late-night show; and ''Gaytime TV,'' a magazine show about gay life that critics described as ''deliberately frivolous.''</p>
        <p>The rock star is 45-year-old Bob Geldof, the organizer of the ''Live Aid'' benefits for famine relief in Africa. But by all accounts the chief creative force in the team is Charlie Parsons, 42, a longtime producer and creator of shows and a man Mr. Davies calls ''the brightest guy I've ever been around in television.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Parsons and Lord Alli, partners in life as well as in business, have contributed media advice to Prime Minister Tony Blair and are known for lavish Christmas parties on their estate in Kent, attended by many of the most prominent members of the Labor government. Lord Alli is famously press shy, reputedly having given only one interview in his life.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Parsons says, Lord Alli divides his time between his political duties in the House of Lords and his duties as a television executive. ''It's a bit mad,'' Mr. Parsons said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>But, he said, after the years of waiting, it is gratifying to own the hottest show in television.</p>
        <p>To say nothing of lucrative. Mr. Parsons, Lord Alli and Mr. Geldof divided about $20 million when they sold Planet 24 to Carlton Television a year ago. And thanks to Mr. Parsons's insistence on excluding the ''Survivor'' concept from that sale, the partners stand to reap another big payoff.</p>
        <p>The idea for ''Survivor'' came up in 1988, Mr. Parsons said, in a segment for one of his earlier creations, ''Network 7.'' He was looking for something ''cutting edge,' he said, something that hadn't been tried before. So Mr. Parsons dumped four participants, including a tennis star and an ex-convict, onto an island with cameras recording their efforts to survive together. He refined the idea until he had the current format: 16 people, lots of tests and games, a vote to eliminate teammates and one winner.</p>
        <p>Finding a buyer was the tough part. No British television entity was interested. But Mr. Parsons had a British connection in American television: Mr. Davies. Shortly after graduating from the University of Edinburgh, Mr. Davies started out in Hollywood writing for the game show ''Let's Make a Deal.'' By the time Mr. Parsons called, Mr. Davies was an executive at Buena Vista Television, the production arm of Walt Disney. He was, in Mr. Parsons's words, ''very keen on 'Survivor.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davies pitched the show around and won some interest at both ABC and Fox. This was 1995.</p>
        <p>''I had a pretty interesting reputation in those days,'' Mr. Davies said. ''I'd go around and there'd be these raised eyebrows: 'What's this crazy Brit going to come up with today?' ''</p>
        <p>At ABC Stu Bloomberg, then executive vice president for entertainment, was enthusiastic about the island survival show. ''Stu really got it,'' Mr. Davies said.</p>
        <p>The problem was that there was no pilot, and there could be no pilot for such a series. So Mr. Davies took $150,000 in development money from Mr. Bloomberg and built a model of the island. The show was never picked up.</p>
        <p>It might have ended there if another British expatriate had not dropped himself into the scene: Mark Burnett, a former paratrooper and outdoorsman, had developed ''Eco-Challenge,'' an environmentally correct adventure road race for MTV. Mr. Burnett's background is deep in adventurism, starting with his decision to join the elite British Parachute Regiment at 18, and when he heard the concept, he campaigned to acquire the American rights. ''He always kept hustling for it,'' Mr. Parsons said.</p>
        <p>Still, no American network would bite. So Lord Alli and Mr. Parsons sold the idea to Swedish television under the title ''Expedition Robinson,'' as in ''Swiss Family.'' Now they had proof of how the concept worked on television. The only problem was that the first participant to be kicked off the island committed suicide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davies, by then at ABC as executive in charge of alternative series, was worried about the suicide but ''I had so much faith in Mark Burnett as a producer that I sent him to Disney.'' There the concept was enthusiastically supported by Lloyd Braun, the head of Disney's production company.</p>
        <p>It was at this point that another television idea percolating in Britain dropped unexpectedly onto Mr. Davies' doorstep.</p>
        <p>In London a friend of Mr. Davies, Duncan Gray, who worked for the ITV network, attended the first taping of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and immediately sent off a tape to Mr. Davies. ''I said to myself, This is the best quiz show format, perhaps the best format, I have ever seen,'' Mr. Davies said.</p>
        <p>Even though the networks had for decades disdained game shows in prime time, mainly because they were thought to attract older viewers, Mr. Davies sent tapes of the show around ABC corporate meetings. Mr. Bloomberg again was enthusiastic. So was Michael Eisner, the Disney chairman. ''I got this e-mail from Michael saying something like, 'I'm not sure if I'm embarrassed by this, but I really, really like this program.' ''</p>
        <p>But one of the biggest hurdles was the format established in Britain, where the show played 13 nights in a row.</p>
        <p>That tournament-style format was one of the show's great assets, Mr. Smith said. And it was far more typical of British television, which does not depend on yearly runs of 22-episodes, to break away from the traditional once-a-week series format.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davies needed a crosscultural breakthrough. He brought in another key player, Ben Silverman, an agent with the William Morris Agency who had been living in London and watching British television for four years. ''I needed somebody on the ground in London to explain the difference between American and British television to Paul,'' Mr. Davies said, speaking of Paul Smith, Celador's managing director.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Silverman's help, Mr. Smith made the deal with ABC. Mr. Davies then made a decision of his own. He quit his executive job at the network to become the executive producer of ''Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' still had no American home, though Mr. Burnett had promising negotiations going with CBS.</p>
        <p>''I thought that in some quarters of ABC there wasn't enough passion for 'Survivor,' '' Mr. Davies said. ''And I wondered whether we could launch 'Millionaire' and 'Survivor' in the same year.''</p>
        <p>CBS stepped up. ''All credit to CBS for taking on the risk,'' Mr. Parsons said. The show went on CBS in June and eclipsed last summer's ''Millionaire'' ratings, especially among younger viewers, whom CBS had not been able to reach with any other programming.</p>
        <p>More than anything, Mr. Davies said, he is glad to be part of the trend toward ''globalization of television concepts.'' ''Millionaire'' is a hit in 29 countries and has sold in 50 more. 'Survivor' is already sold in Germany, Argentina, Denmark and Spain and expectations are that with the American success, it will sell far and wide.</p>
        <p>''A year ago,'' Mr. Davies said, ''if I had said the two biggest things in television are going to be a young-skewing show on CBS that's a reality concept based on a British-created Swedish television program produced by a former British paratrooper and part owned by a member of Parliament, and a prime-time quiz show hosted by Regis Philbin, that would have been an inconceivable notion.''</p>
        <p>But he added, ''It is even more inconceivable that American television had completely boxed itself in, that everybody thought television was only dramas, sitcoms and news magazines. I think it's fantastic now that everybody's thinking, What can we do next?''</p>
