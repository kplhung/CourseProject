        <p>Amtrak said yesterday that it had placed its corporate account in review. Billings were estimated at $35 million.</p>
        <p>Bill Schulz, a spokesman for Amtrak in Washington, confirmed reports of the review this week in Advertising Age and Adweek. The account had been divided among the New York office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, for creative and media duties on assignments like the new Acela trains; the E. James White Company in Herndon, Va., for promotional duties; and the Chicago office of Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, for the Amtrak Intercity trains. Lowe Lintas Chicago closed in March.</p>
