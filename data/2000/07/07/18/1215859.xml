        <p>The national debate over the death penalty took an odd turn today when Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas each discussed what to do in the hypothetical case of a pregnant woman facing execution.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Gore, the issue was one of abortion rights: he would let the woman decide whether the execution should be delayed, allowing her the option of whether or not to give birth.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Bush, who has presided over more executions than any other governor in the country, it was a matter of pointing to the compassion in his conservatism. He said he would support postponing such an execution ''because there's a second life involved.''</p>
        <p>As a practical matter, the issue has apparently been moot. Experts on the death penalty said the situation had never arisen on the federal level since Congress created an exclusion for pregnant women when it expanded the federal death penalty law in 1994. Several states, including Texas, have also enacted such exclusions, but no experts reached today could remember a single case in which a pregnant woman faced execution.</p>
        <p>The question first came up on Sunday in an interview with Mr. Gore on the NBC News television program ''Meet the Press.'' The vice president, who backs the death penalty,  was asked whether he would support it if the condemned prisoner happened to be pregnant. Mr. Gore replied that he was unfamiliar with the issue and would have to examine it.</p>
        <p>At a news conference today shortly after rallying his troops in Nashville, where his presidential campaign makes its headquarters, Mr. Gore said he favored allowing a pregnant woman to choose whether to delay her execution until she gave birth.</p>
        <p>''The principle of a woman's right to choose governs in that case,'' he  said.</p>
        <p>At an earlier news conference in Little Rock, Ark., Governor Bush tweaked Mr. Gore for his answer in the television interview, saying he was ''surprised, frankly,'' that the vice president had needed time to think about the matter.</p>
        <p>Death penalty opponents said that the subject was a bit far afield in the larger debate on capital punishment but that it nonetheless underscored the kind of harsh reality involved in putting people to death.</p>
        <p>''This question is yet another illustration of the fact that the discussion and debate around the issue is becoming more specific and less abstract,'' said Diann Rust-Tierney, director of the capital punishment project at the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore addressed the subject after flying here to his home state today, armed with new poll numbers showing his race with Mr. Bush growing tighter.</p>
        <p>He continued his attack on Mr. Bush's record in Texas and, in casting his own candidacy in classic Democratic terms as a fight for the disadvantaged, made personal reference to his childhood.</p>
        <p>''When I think of what this campaign is all about, I think of my own upbringing,'' he told a gathering of his field workers from the 50 states at the Nashville rally.</p>
        <p>''I had two sets of really good friends, one in Washington, D.C., and the other in Carthage, Tenn.,'' he said of his son-of-a-senator winters and his family-farm summers. He said the friends in Washington had come from well-to-do families, gone  to college and enjoyed lots of advantages. The ones in Tennessee, he said, ''were just as bright -- at least as bright -- and had at least as much potential as the ones I grew up with in Washington, but they did not have the same opportunities.''</p>
        <p>This disparity ''broke my heart, because I saw that they did not get what they deserved in life by virtue of their talent and their potential,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''As I travel around this country today,'' he added, ''I see young men and women and Americans of all ages like my friends who I know deserve to have the barriers removed, the opportunities opened up so that they can reach their full potential.''</p>
        <p>This theme, populist in nature and Democratic by tradition, dovetails with the policy formulations Mr. Gore has been developing over the last several weeks, particularly as he rails against the ''special interests'' like big oil that he says Mr. Bush is serving.</p>
        <p>This was officially Commerce Secretary William M. Daley's first day  as Gore campaign chairman, and, in a Nashville briefing with campaign workers from around the country  that was closed to reporters, the vice president pointed to a new CNN/USA Today poll that showed him trailing Mr. Bush by only 2 points, 43 percent to 45 percent; that was considerably closer than last month's CNN poll, which had Mr. Gore trailing by 12 points. A new CBS poll also showed Mr. Gore narrowing the race to 2 percentage points, 41 percent to 43 percent; in mid-May, Mr. Gore trailed in that poll by 8 points.</p>
        <p>After lunch with his mother and a  conference with campaign strategists, Mr. Gore greeted the dozens of workers who staff his Nashville headquarters. Standing on a chair, surrounded by the mostly college-age crowd, he adopted the language that his 26-year-old daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, uses to reach her under-30 audiences.</p>
        <p>In appealing to their sense of idealism, Mr. Gore warned the young workers to avoid the ''ironic detachment'' that afflicts the cynical. He said some people became detached because they were afraid that if they gave their hearts to something, they would only be let down.</p>
        <p>''Give it everything you have got,'' he exhorted them, ''and then some.''</p>
        <p>At his news conference later in the day before he flew on here to Memphis, Mr. Gore was asked how he would square his criticism that Mr. Bush had mismanaged the state budget in Texas with his earlier assertions that Mr. Bush was a weak governor who had little power.</p>
        <p>''What power he does have he has used to ill effect,'' Mr. Gore replied. He called Mr. Bush's budget a ''two-page ditty'' that served only the special interests.</p>
        <p>In defense of his record as governor, Mr. Bush has often noted that the people of Texas re-elected him in 1998 with nearly 70 percent of the vote. To that, Mr. Gore scoffed today,  ''People in the other 49 states vote in this election.''</p>
