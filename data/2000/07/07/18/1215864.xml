        <p>Despite signs of strength in the Japanese economy, policy makers at the nation's central bank voted today to keep short-term interest rates at virtually zero, concerned about the financial effects of a highly indebted department store company's failure last week.</p>
        <p>In a statement unusual here in its attempt to explain the decision, the bank said it had decided to leave rates alone because of continued uncertainty about employment and wages. Even more unusual was its mention of the the failed department store operator, the Sogo Company, which declared bankruptcy under the weight of loans exceeding $17 billion.</p>
        <p>''It was pointed out that the board needed to see how the commencement of reconstruction proceedings of Sogo Company could affect market developments and business sentiment,'' a statement by the bank said after its nine-member policy board ended a regular monthly meeting.</p>
        <p>Speculation had been building for weeks that the central bankers would nudge interest rates upward today for the first time in 10 years amid evidence that Japan's economy, the world's second largest, is in a sustainable recovery from its worst period of protracted economic weakness since the end of World War II.</p>
        <p>Central bank officials have said that keeping rates so low is abnormal and should be considered temporary, hinting that recent evidence of economic strength such as improved corporate profit, rising production and higher business investment justifies a rate increase.</p>
        <p>But the collapse of Sogo, which operates 25 stores and employs 10,000 people, dampened optimism and served as a sobering reminder of how much bad debt still infects the Japanese banking system. Rising interest rates would make it more expensive and difficult for debtors like Sogo to repay loans, which could lead to further business failures.</p>
        <p>The central bank's decision to leave rates alone was welcomed by economists, government officials and party politicians, many of whom have argued in recent weeks that the bank lacked a clear-cut rationale for raising rates and ran the risk of short-circuiting an economic recovery that some still find unconvincing.</p>
        <p>''The bank seemed adamant about raising rates last week,'' said Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz Securities in Tokyo. ''The fact that they didn't do it immediately was related to Sogo, which reinvigorated uncertainty about the economy.'' He said that the rate news was likely to have a positive effect on the stock and bond markets, which have been bracing for a slight increase in rates, but that it might weaken the yen.</p>
        <p>Jesper Koll, chief economist at Merrill Lynch here, said he believed that today's decision would force the central bankers to postpone a rate increase for at least a year and perhaps longer. ''I actually think in terms of the business cycle, we're peaking out right about now,'' he said. ''Industrial production is now growing 7 percent compared to last year, but I think at the end of the year, we'll be at about half that pace.''</p>
        <p>How the bank might determine that its concerns about Sogo can be safely set aside is unclear. There will be little economic data released between now and Aug. 11, when the policy board next meets, and officials did not spell out which areas of economic performance they would be watching.</p>
        <p>''Economic conditions are now strong enough to be compatible with rising rates,'' said Masaaki Kanno, senior economist at J. P. Morgan here, ''so unless we see some unexpectedly weak indicators over the next month, we could see an increase in August. Stock prices are probably going to be quite important.''</p>
        <p>He said if the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index, which at 17,286.83 is down 8.7 percent for the year, rises above the 18,000 level and remains there, the bank might increase rates next month. [By the midday trading break on Tuesday, the Nikkei index was down 81.88 points, or nearly half a percent.]</p>
        <p>While there was widespread praise for the central bankers' restraint, the decision raised questions about when the bank would carry through on its eventual intentions to raise rates. ''The importance of the decision is not so much about interest rates as it is about credibility,'' said Marshall Gittler, a currency strategist at the Bank of America in Hong Kong. ''The Bank of Japan is now the central bank that cried wolf.''</p>
        <p>Masaru Hayami, the bank's governor, has made clear that he wants to increase rates, and quickly, arguing that the so-called zero-interest rate policy had been adopted as an emergency measure in February 1999.</p>
        <p>Such an extremely loose monetary policy ordinarily runs the risk of fueling inflation. But Japan has opposite problems: Prices are falling here. Consumer spending is erratic at best, and bankruptcies are rising to record levels.</p>
        <p>Although business investment has picked up, companies are not borrowing to finance their expenditures even with the exceptionally low interest rates.</p>
        <p>Referring to rate policy, Richard C. Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute, remarked:  ''My own view is that monetary policy in this current environment, when everyone is trying to pay down debt, is largely irrelevant. So I think a little too much emphasis has been placed on this issue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Koo said the central bank was correct to delay a rate increase in the wake of Sogo's bankruptcy filing. Sogo failed after the government abandoned plans to use 97 billion yen in public funds, or nearly $900 million, as part of a plan to forgive some of the company's debts.</p>
        <p>That switch was initially seen as a sign that politicians would stand aside and allow painful structural adjustments in the economy. And while investors in general are applauding the decision on Sogo, they have also begun trying to assess its costs.</p>
        <p>Although the original plan would have required a handful of major banks and the taxpayers to shoulder the burden of Sogo's debts, it seems clear that allowing the retailer to fail under court supervision will spread the pain to scores of smaller financial institutions and trade creditors.</p>
        <p>And the government will presumably have trouble coming to the rescue of other heavily indebted companies, now that it has set a precedent with Sogo. ''If this kind of thing goes on unabated, we could actually break the cycle of growth that the Japanese economy is in,'' Mr. Koo said.</p>
