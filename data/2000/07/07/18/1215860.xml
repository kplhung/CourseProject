        <p>A police officer pursuing a suspected motorcycle thief in a high-speed chase was killed yesterday after his unmarked patrol car spun out of control and hit a utility pole along a service road to the Staten Island Expressway, officials said.</p>
        <p>Investigators said Officer John M. Kelly, driving alone, had been racing to catch the motorcycle when his car veered off Gulf Avenue in the Bloomfield section about 1:20 p.m. and crashed into a wooden utility pole, which became deeply imbedded in the driver's side of the vehicle.</p>
        <p>Officer Kelly suffered multiple  injuries, including head injuries. Doctors at St. Vincent's Medical Center on Staten Island worked to keep him alive, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said. But he was pronounced dead at 4:55 p.m. His wife, Patricia, who is also a police officer, and other family members were at his side.</p>
        <p>''They kept him alive long enough so his mother could be here with him,'' Mr. Giuliani said, looking weary, as he stood outside the hospital with Police Commissioner Howard Safir moments after the officer died.</p>
        <p>Officer Kelly, 31, an eight-year veteran who was assigned to the Auto Larceny Unit on Staten Island, was the second officer killed in the line of duty this year. The other, Officer David Regan, 28, died in May when his patrol car collided with a newspaper delivery truck at a Brooklyn intersection.</p>
        <p>In describing their grief yesterday, officials spoke not only about Officer Kelly's dedication, which was evident, they said, in the four police decorations he had received, but also of his family's contributions to the city's public safety.</p>
        <p>In addition to his wife, who is assigned to the 120th Precinct on Staten Island, and their two boys, 9 months and 2 years old, Officer Kelly is survived by three brothers who are New York City police officers, officials said. And his wife has two brothers on the force, a sister who recently retired from the Police Department and a brother who is a city  firefighter.</p>
        <p>''This family has sacrificed for the city of New York,'' Mr. Giuliani said, ''and now unfortunately it has been called to make the greatest sacrifice.''</p>
        <p>Officials said that the unit that Officer Kelly worked for was largely responsible for the 75 percent drop in auto thefts in Staten Island over the last seven years and that Officer Kelly had shown a special commitment to the work, spending his own money at one point to buy night-vision goggles so that he could do a better job of surveillance on suspected car thieves.</p>
        <p>''John Kelly died a hero,'' Commissioner Safir said, ''doing what he was trained to do and what he loved to do. He had a reputation for never, ever shirking his duty.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Officer Kelly was assigned to red light enforcement, in which he was supposed to patrol with an eye toward catching people who disregarded traffic signals. Officials said it was unclear how he came to notice the biker, described as a white male in a black leather vest driving a maroon motorcycle.</p>
        <p>But at some point, they said, Officer Kelly grew suspicious and called in the plate number of the bike on his radio.</p>
        <p>He was told that the plate, which was registered to a man from Lower Manhattan, had been reported stolen on May 6 on Staten Island, and Officer Kelly began to chase the motorcyclist his black 1999 Chevrolet Lumina.</p>
        <p>Officials said it was unclear where the chase began, but it ended on Gulf Avenue, a one-way road that runs parallel to the Staten Island Expressway for a stretch near the Goethals Bridge to New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Nearby business owners say the isolated road has been used for drag racing because there are no lights, few buildings and only a handful of intersecting streets.</p>
        <p>Officials and people who had surveyed the accident scene said that it appeared the biker had made a sharp left turn at one point, and headed down one of the few intersecting streets, Forest Avenue.</p>
        <p>Officer Kelly attempted to follow but his tires lost traction and his car began to spin until it slammed into a utility pole several hundred yards past the intersection, officials said.</p>
        <p>When emergency workers arrived at the scene, Officer Kelly was in cardiac arrest, officials said. Michael Charles, a tow truck driver for J&amp;J Towing who was called to the scene, said the impact of the crash appeared to have knocked Officer Kelly into the back seat of the cruiser. Although officials said the investigation was in its preliminary stage, they said it did not appear that Officer Kelly had been wearing a seat belt.</p>
        <p>In recreating what they believed happened, officials were relying in part on the account of one witness, a woman who said she saw part of the chase, and on the skid marks left by the officer's car.</p>
        <p>At Officer Kelly's home on Staten Island, a man standing outside who identified himself as one of the officer's brothers said he could not speak yet about the accident or his brother. ''The family is a little overcome right now,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Earlier outside the hospital, Officer Kelly's partner, Bill Panzella, had also appeared visibly shaken. He had been on vacation when the accident occurred.</p>
        <p>''Normally I would have been with him today,'' he said. ''It could have turned out different.''</p>
