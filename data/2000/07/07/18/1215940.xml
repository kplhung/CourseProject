        <p>Promises of signing top players has been the platform for those running for the presidency of clubs in Spain. After Florentino Perez's election to the presidency of Real Madrid on the strength of his promise to sign Luis Figo, Barcelona's presidential campaign took a familiar twist yesterday when one candidate promised he would sign Zinedine Zidane of France if he were elected.</p>
        <p>During a debate among three candidates yesterday for the presidency of Barcelona, Bassat said his group had an agreement with Zidane, who led France to the World Cup title in 1998 and the European Championship last month. Bassat has been supported by Johan Cruyff, the former player and manager of Barcelona, who also played for Los Angeles and Washington in the North American Soccer League more than two decades ago.</p>
