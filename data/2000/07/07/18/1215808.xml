        <p>It has been 55 years since Karel Horak was forced to work at Czech factories seized by Hitler's forces. Today, as he watched with the patience acquired over a long life, the United States and Germany approved a $5 billion agreement to compensate forced laborers like him from the Nazi era.</p>
        <p>''I just hope they can move quickly,'' Mr. Horak said, ''because I am already 80 years old. People around me are dying very rapidly.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Horak, who is vice president of an association in Prague of former forced workers, said, ''We had 640,000 forced laborers at the end of the war, and now there are only 61,000.''</p>
        <p>Today, after a half-century of denial and two years of grueling negotiations, German government and industry leaders formally signed an agreement that is intended to bring at least legal closure to the last remaining claims arising from atrocities of the Nazi regime.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, the German government and German companies will contribute equally to a $5 billion fund to compensate former laborers, possibly more than a million of them, who were slave workers in concentration camps or forced laborers in German factories.</p>
        <p>Former slave workers are entitled to payments of about $7,500. Former forced laborers are entitled to about $2,500.</p>
        <p>Other victims, such as people who had their property seized or who were victims of Nazi medical experiments, will also be able to file for compensation.</p>
        <p>In exchange for the agreement, President Clinton has pledged that the United States will do everything it can to block new class-action lawsuits brought in the United States against German corporations.</p>
        <p>It is a historic bargain, because it is intended to compensate Nazi-era victims in more than 20 countries, from Poland and Ukraine to Russia and Israel.</p>
        <p>Only a small minority of the people have ever set foot in the United States, but the United States assumed the lead negotiating role with Germany because American class-action lawyers had filed lawsuits on behalf of victims from around the world against German companies like DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Deutsche Bank.</p>
        <p>There are still a few snags, including the fact that German companies have raised only half the amount they have pledged. But people on all sides of the talks predicted today that the money is not in serious doubt. With any luck, they said, survivors would start receiving payments sometime this year.</p>
        <p>''This fills a void that has existed for 55 years,'' said Stuart E. Eizenstat, the United States deputy secretary of Treasury, who led negotiations for the American government. ''This had never been dealt with. It had fallen off the agenda.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers who brought the cases will earn a large amount, about $50 million, but that is just 1 percent of the total, Mr. Eizenstat said.</p>
        <p>Germany has paid nearly $100 billion in various forms of compensation and support to Jewish groups, the state of Israel and to Central European countries that the Germans invaded during World War II.</p>
        <p>But surviving forced laborers received little or nothing, largely because German corporations insisted that the government was responsible. And former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who controlled the government from 1982 to 1998, adamantly refused to contribute any public money to the workers.</p>
        <p>But two things abruptly changed the picture. The first was the successful use of American class-action lawsuits against Swiss banks, which had been accused of hoarding wealth in dormant accounts set up by Holocaust victims. The suits never went to trial and the Swiss banks agreed to settle out of court with promises to pay $1.25 billion. The Swiss case quickly prompted American lawyers to take aim at German corporations, particularly on the issue of forced labor. Though none of the cases have succeeded in court, and two were rejected by federal courts, the threat of prolonged litigation and nightmarish publicity was terrifying to companies like DaimlerChrysler and Deutsche Bank which do vast amounts of business in the United States.</p>
        <p>The other big change was Gerhard Schroder's election as chancellor in late 1998. Almost immediately, Mr. Schroder announced his desire to create a foundation that would compensate victims and that would be funded in part with government money.</p>
        <p>''Without the government's willingness to contribute, we could never have gotten up to the minimum level we needed,'' Mr. Eizenstat said in an interview today. ''The fact that the government came in at a time when it was cutting its own budget is remarkable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schroder, presiding over the signing ceremonies, seemed mainly relieved that the negotiations were finally over. When German businesses first proposed a settlement 2 years ago, they offered 1.5 billion marks, or about $750 million at current exchange rates. Attorneys representing survivors, by contrast, were making demands as high as $30 billion.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Eizenstat led negotiations with Count Otto Lambsdorff, who represented German industry, many Central European leaders felt they had been relegated to the sidelines.</p>
        <p>''We were invited to be guests, to be observers, but not to be direct participants,'' complained Jerzy Kranz, head of the Polish delegation to the talks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eizenstat vehemently denied excluding Central European leaders from the key discussions, and he noted that most of the money will go to survivors in Central Europe. And despite the somewhat injured feelings, representatives from Poland, the Czech Republic, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine all supported the final agreements today.</p>
        <p>Noach Flug, a former slave worker in Poland who now represents the International Auschwitz Committee in Jerusalem, said the final agreement was far better for all of the victims' groups than what German corporations or the German government originally proposed.</p>
        <p>''The final agreement is completely different,'' Mr. Flug said. ''It is 50 years late and 80 percent of the people have already died, but it is at least something.''</p>
