        <p>They grew up side by side on the banks of the Mississippi River, two 19th-century milling companies that competed head to head and made this city the flour capital of the world.</p>
        <p>Their decades-old signs still face each other across the river in symbolic combat --''Gold Medal Flour,'' from General Mills, on the west bank, and ''Pillsbury's Best'' on the east. Today, though, General Mills and Pillsbury said they are uniting to create a food giant with more than $12 billion in annual sales.</p>
        <p>The initial announcement came from Diageo, the British conglomerate, which acquired Pillsbury more than a decade ago. Diageo said early today that it had agreed to sell Pillsbury to General Mills in a $10.5 billion deal, forming the fourth largest food company in the world. The merger would bring together such well-known brands as Cheerios, Wheaties, Haagen Dazs, Yoplait yogurt, Hamburger Helper, Jolly Green Giant vegetables and Pillsbury bakery items, though not all these products will remain within the new company's stable.</p>
        <p>The planned merger comes during a frenzy of big food company combinations, in which food makers are trying to bolster their growth prospects through acquisitions and global power plays.</p>
        <p>General Mills and Pillsbury now say they believe that Betty Crocker and the Pillsbury Doughboy are a good fit and that marketing and distributing their products together will yield huge benefits. The companies also say they know each other well, and their cultures are quite similar, which should make it a friendly merger.</p>
        <p>Though many here worry about the job cuts that are sure to follow, others are pleased that two companies that grew up together on the Mississippi will remain in Minneapolis under the General Mills name.</p>
        <p>''I like the fact that Pillsbury is being acquired by General Mills,'' said Sharon Sayles Belton, the mayor of Minneapolis. ''They have a history of strong ties to the community. And I think General Mills is going to grow. Short term there may be some job losses, but long term there'll be growth.''</p>
        <p>Another reason the concern here is muted is that ownership of Pillsbury returns to Minneapolis after more than a decade in London, where the company was controlled by Diageo.</p>
        <p>''These companies and their milling stories are really the signature of Minnesota,'' said Nina Archabal, director of the Minnesota Historical Society. ''To have these companies joined and governed in Minnesota is a tremendous benefit to our community.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, after starting out in the flour milling business, General Mills and Pillsbury took widely divergent paths. They both created premier brands, with Pillsbury staying closer to bakery items and General Mills becoming a dominant player in the cereal business. But they also strayed from their roots.</p>
        <p>Pillsbury acquired Burger King in 1967, helping make it into a major player in the fast-food business, before the two companies were eventually acquired by Diageo, which specializes in liquor. General Mills also departed from the flour and cereal business, gaining control over Izod/Lacoste, the retailers Eddie Bauer and Talbots, Parker Brothers games and Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurants, all of which are now gone.</p>
        <p>Only in recent years, after a series of divestitures and spinoffs, has General Mills sharpened its focus on cereal, bakery items and yogurt.</p>
        <p>Though the company suffered during a period of competitive price-cutting in the cereal industry in the early 1990's, General Mills has been a strong performer in most of its businesses over the last few years.</p>
        <p>The company recently passed Kellogg's as the nation's leading cereal maker, though the two are neck and neck, and its Yoplait and Colombo yogurts give it supremacy in the category. General Mills has also extended its product lines with Frosted Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios as well as Go-Gurt, a squeezable tubed yogurt product designed for children.</p>
        <p>Company executives have also tried to capitalize on health news to promote their cereals, moving into organic food with the purchase of Small Planet Foods Inc. They are working on creating more convenience and instant foods for the growing number of Americans who are eating on the go.</p>
        <p>Because of such innovation, General Mills has largely outperformed other food companies in the last two years. Most are facing slow growth prospects in a mature market with increasing pressure from bigger and bigger retailers. General Mills, meanwhile, has promised double digit profit growth and Wall Street had cheered its plans, at least until today.</p>
        <p>Shares of the company fell sharply today because some analysts and investors worry that Pillsbury is going to be a drag on earnings. While the company has a hot food service division and some healthy profits in refrigerated products like Pillsbury dough items and Haagen Dazs, canned vegetables and other frozen items have been a drag.</p>
        <p>Some analysts believe General Mills may have felt pressured to make a deal and been forced to pay too heavily for Pillsbury.</p>
        <p>''They paid a stiff price for this,'' said Art Cecil, a food industry analyst at T. Rowe Price, which owns a large stake in General Mills. ''I'd rather they not have done it. I thought Mills was a great situation. They had great cash flow, innovative management; it seemed a tidy situation. And now earnings are going to be diluted by a fairly significant amount.''</p>
        <p>John McMillin, a longtime food analyst at Prudential, disagrees. Though he says General Mills is going to have to do a lot to convince Wall Street that this is a good deal, he believes the company is moving aggressively to build a giant food portfolio after more than a decade of trying to slim down and get out of restaurant and non-food businesses.</p>
        <p>''General Mills has been on a diet for most of the 15 years I've followed it,'' Mr. McMillin said. ''But this deal with Pillsbury gives them more growth opportunities, and growth is a rare commodity in the food industry.''</p>
        <p>Executives at General Mills say that for antitrust reasons the new company, which will be called General Mills, will divest itself of Pillsbury's dessert business, which is second only to General Mills. The company will also sell its canned vegetable business, but keep Green Giant frozen vegetables and meal starters, thereby retaining the Jolly Green Giant icon.</p>
        <p>The company also hopes the Pillsbury Doughboy will fit in well with marketing efforts that have kept Cheerios and even Betty Crocker in the public spotlight.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the merger makes General Mills not just a much bigger company, but one that is more diversified in the refigerated section with ice cream to go with its yogurt and frozen vegetables, breakfast offerings and more.</p>
        <p>Executives say that General Mills's marketing will help bolster Pillsbury brands that are growing at a slower pace than their categories.</p>
        <p>General Mills brands, on the other hand, have been able to grow faster than their categories, and that is a large part of the growth story.</p>
        <p>The man behind these initiatives will be Steven Sanger, the 54-year-old chief executive at General Mills. Mr. Sanger, who took over in 1995, has said that key drivers in the food industry will include increasing convenience (''driven by the pace of consumer lifestyles,'') concerns about health, and international sales. He also stresses creating products to be sold outside of supermarkets and, eventually, the use of biotechnology to create more nutritious foods.</p>
        <p>Indeed, General Mills's strength in the last year has been in marked contrast with Pillsbury, which has gone through an earnings slowdown.  General Mills has long been considered the bigger and better run company here in Minneapolis, and some Pillsbury staff members are wondering what that will mean for them.</p>
        <p>''It's been a tough day here,'' said Dorrese Bona, a 20-year employee at Pillsbury, as she sat in her cubicle hours after the announced merger.  ''But with change comes opportunity. General Mills has some good brands so we'll see what happens.''</p>
        <p>Employees at Pillsbury were wondering today whether they would be moving just outside of Minneapolis, to Golden Valley, Minn., where General Mills headquarters is located on a 50-acre campus. But company officials said today that they had run out of space in Golden Valley, and Mayor Belton of Minneapolis said she was assured that many Pillsbury employees would remain downtown, in a 40-story office tower called the Pillsbury Center.</p>
        <p>Together, the two companies have more than 6,000 employees in Minnesota, most of them in Minneapolis. The General Mills headquarters is suburban and breezy, but more corporate; Pillsbury is urban yet relaxed, with Pillsbury Doughboy dolls on nearly every desk and the halls decked with the Doughboy and the Green Giant standing in tandem.</p>
        <p>Though some have called the General Mills corporate culture more ''button down'' and the Pillsbury culture more ''free-wheeling,'' executives at General Mills say Mr. Sanger, the chief executive, is aggressive, yet relaxed. He loves rock, surfs the Web and once invited a fellow executive to join him at a Van Morrison concert.</p>
