        <p>Orlando Hernandez is not expected to make his scheduled start against the Detroit Tigers tomorrow night because of continuing complications from his right elbow injury.

        <p>Orlando Hernandez is not expected to make his scheduled start against the Detroit Tigers tomorrow night because of continuing complications from his right elbow injury. The Yankees are hoping Hernandez will have to miss only one start, but the pitcher's injury has puzzled them, so there is some uncertainty.</p>
        <p>Hernandez has had two M.R.I.'s, and no structural damage has been found in his elbow. When Hernandez initially felt the pain after surrendering nine runs in the first inning against the Chicago White Sox on June 18, he underwent an M.R.I. and was found to have a sprained elbow. Hernandez had a second M.R.I. a few days later, and Dr. James Andrews confirmed the original diagnosis.</p>
        <p>Hernandez rested for 12 days, came back to register victories over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and the Mets and was then battered for eight runs against the Florida Marlins last Thursday. When General Manager Brian Cashman was asked if Hernandez was doubtful for starting tomorrow's game, he said, ''I wouldn't be able to comment on that.''</p>
        <p>Cashman deflected other questions about whether Hernandez's condition had worsened since his last start. Hernandez had seven days off before opposing the Marlins because of the All-Star Game break, but his fastball was sluggish, he allowed two three-run homers and Manager Joe Torre admitted that he looked uncomfortable. That is why the Yankees are likely to move Roger Clemens up by one day and start him instead of Hernandez tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Because Saturday's game with the Marlins was rained out, the Yankees have more flexibility with their rotation, and that gives them the luxury of skipping Hernandez and using Clemens on his regular four days' rest. If Hernandez's elbow injury is a minor problem and he has to miss only one start, he would presumably return in about a week. He is 8-7 with a 4.57 earned run average.</p>
        <p>Hernandez missed a start in spring training because of back trouble and then missed another start in late May because of more back problems. One club official said that Hernandez could probably have pitched tomorrow if the Yankees needed him to, but they preferred to be cautious and take advantage of the rare chance to give a starter a rest. The Yankees only have two more days off for the rest of the regular season.</p>
        <p>As Hernandez stood by himself in the first-base dugout yesterday, he was asked how his elbow felt. Hernandez quickly answered ''no problem'' and jogged away before a reporter could ask another question.</p>
