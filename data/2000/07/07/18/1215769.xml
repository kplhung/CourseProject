        <p>Lynn Weisbach walks on a treadmill five days a week between the deli and produce sections of her grocery store. That's because the health club she belongs to, CardioTheater Express in Alpharetta, Ga., is tucked into the front corner of a Kroger supermarket.</p>
        <p>''It saves time because I have to shop anyway,'' said Ms. Weisbach, a 46-year-old painter, who started walking on the treadmill six months ago to lower her blood pressure. ''If this wasn't here, I'd have to drive somewhere. In that case, I don't think I'd be exercising.''</p>
        <p>Increasingly, commercial health clubs are turning up in interesting places. These kinds of exercise centers within other centers have a name: mini-fusion workout centers. They are usually smaller and generally less expensive than full-scale health clubs, and are in areas where people would go anyway, like Laundromats, truck stops, and airports. Their purpose is to fuse exercise with another activity to make it more convenient for time-squeezed Americans who also want to get and stay fit.</p>
        <p>The American Council on Exercise, a watchdog organization in San Diego, named mini-fusion centers a major fitness trend for this year. Exercise centers in hotels and apartment complexes are now common. Mini-fusion centers are a twist on that theme, said Ken Alan, a personal trainer and college exercise instructor in Los Angeles, who is a spokesman for ACE.</p>
        <p>''The No. 1 reason people say they don't exercise is because of time,'' Mr. Alan said. ''But this kind of facility brings the club to the consumer, to make working out easier and more accessible.''</p>
        <p>The International Health, Racquet and  Sportsclub Association, the trade organization for health clubs, has also taken note of the mini-fusion trend. Though the organization has no specific data on these kinds of clubs, William C. Howland Jr., the association's director of public relations and research, said that more and more small facilities were popping up in unusual places.  It makes sense, he added. If workout centers are in places where customers can come and go easily, they will join.</p>
        <p>Even better, people appreciate working out in places where once they get in, they have nothing to do but wait. Like the airport. Paul Rorden, a pilot for National Airlines, exercises for an hour and a half a couple of times a week at 24-Hour Fitness, a health club that opened this year in McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>''All you do as a pilot is wait around, then sit for five hours and then eat,'' said Mr. Rorden, 33, who flies out of Las Vegas 4 to 10 times a week. ''Exercising here is convenient and time well spent.''</p>
        <p>Another company, Airport Fitness, runs a health club at the Pittsburgh International Airport, and hopes to expand into nine more airports in the next five years.</p>
        <p>Traveling is stressful, not just for pilots and flight attendants but for everyone, said Michael E. Michno, president and chief executive of Airport Fitness in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing worse than sitting in place and breathing recycled air. Exercise is a great way to bounce back,'' Mr. Michno said.</p>
        <p>Some people like mini-fusion centers because they feel more comfortable and less intimidated exercising in a familiar place.</p>
        <p>''Lots of people just don't want to walk into a large, full-service health club full of hard-bodies,'' Mr. Alan said. ''They would prefer to get started and build their confidence in a facility that's more comfortable. That's why I expect to see more and more health clubs in places like malls and supermarkets over the next couple of years.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Weisbach added: ''I was the beginner of all beginners when I started. I had tried to join a regular health club, but I didn't make it past the lobby. I'm this gray-headed, middle-aged lady and I felt too intimidated. Kroger's is more intimate. Plus, after I'm finished, I can pick up a few groceries.''</p>
