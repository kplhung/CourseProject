        <p>Michael Greenberg, the founder and president of the trendy shoe company Skechers U.S.A., is so determined to put out his company's message that he follows a written outline when he recites a list of recent feats.</p>
        <p>Skechers (pronounced SKETCH-ers), he says slowly and deliberately between glances at the crumpled bit of paper in front of him in the company booth last month at the Fashion Footwear Association of New York exposition, is now the third-most-popular brand among teenagers, after Nike and Adidas. Company sales, he adds, jumped 40 percent last quarter compared with a year earlier; and as retailers are becoming choosier about which shoe brands to stock, both Lord &amp; Taylor and Athlete's Foot have just signed on.</p>
        <p>''If there was a Gap of footwear,'' Mr. Greenberg, 37, said, ''I believe that Skechers would be that company.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenberg's dogged focus shows as much about his ambitions as about his determination to leave behind what many analysts see as a nagging past.</p>
        <p>Currently, Skechers U.S.A. Inc., based in Manhattan Beach, Calif., seems to be something of a find. As the shoe business slowly revives from its recent slump, the small, eight-year-old family-run company is leading the charge. Its winning formula is simple: Skechers makes lower-priced versions of popular shoes like the latest high-performance Nikes and dressy loafers by Kenneth Cole. And its stock has been among the market's best performers this year.</p>
        <p>That meteoric rise, however, followed a steep decline after Skechers's initial public offering in June 1999 -- a sign, analysts say, of concern that the company has some uncomfortable parallels with the last Greenberg family project, L.A. Gear Inc., one of the retailing industry's most spectacular collapses.</p>
        <p>''The Greenbergs are going to have to prove that Skechers is not L.A. Gear,'' said John Shanley, a senior vice president at Security Van Kaspar who once followed L.A. Gear.</p>
        <p>It was Robert Greenberg, Michael Greenberg's father, who founded L.A. Gear and is widely blamed for its implosion. And while Michael Greenberg founded Skechers -- as a distributor for Doc Martens footwear -- and is its public face and spokesman, his father is the company's chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>The elder Mr. Greenberg sold everything from wigs to roller skates before he stumbled on the idea that would make him famous: a modestly priced hybrid of performance and fashion shoe that women could wear while doing aerobics. L.A. Gear's revenues shot up from $70.6 million in 1987 to $900 million in 1990, making it the third largest in the country, after Nike and Reebok.</p>
        <p>But in a path that is almost unheard of for companies that flirt with the billion-dollar mark, L.A. Gear fell apart almost as quickly as it had grown. The stock, which hit a high of $50.125 in 1990, had tumbled to $11 by 1992. The company eventually filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>
        <p>Analysts say L.A. Gear expanded too quickly. While the company had been successful with stylish aerobic shoes, by 1991 it was offering customers 500 different styles of shoes and apparel. The expansion was poorly timed, occurring as the strongest growth in the shoe industry was in men's athletic shoes -- a market that L.A. Gear, perceived as a women's and children's shoemaker, never could capture. The result was a retailer's nightmare: crate-loads of inventory in a still-weak  economy.</p>
        <p>Legal problems also plagued the operation. L.A. Gear signed a marketing deal with Michael Jackson in 1989 in an attempt to win over men; when that strategy failed, the company entered a lengthy breach-of-contract suit-countersuit tussle with Mr. Jackson. Both Nike and Reebok also fought legal battles with L.A. Gear, contending that the company had illegally used their patented technology. All the suits were eventually settled.</p>
        <p>Robert Greenberg and five other executives were the subject of five shareholder securities fraud suits filed in 1990 and 1991. The class action suits contended that members of L.A. Gear management had issued public documents containing ''materially false and misleading statements'' about the company that led to L.A. Gear's stock becoming ''artificially inflated,'' according to the settlement papers. The defendants eventually settled for a total of $29.8 million without admitting or denying guilt.</p>
        <p>After losses began to mount and the company's credit line was cut, Robert Greenberg was forced to sell a 30 percent minority stake worth $100 million of preferred stock to Trefoil Capital Investors, an investment fund founded by Roy Disney, nephew of the late Walt Disney, and cede much of his control of the company. The Trefoil team eventually ousted him in January 1992 and dismissed Michael Greenberg, then an L.A. Gear national sales manager, soon after.</p>
        <p>Trefoil bailed out in late 1997, after failing to turn the company around. Under PCH Investments, which currently controls the company, L.A. Gear entered and emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1998 a much more modest operation.</p>
        <p>Michael Greenberg insists that his family was unfairly disparaged over L.A. Gear's tumble. ''We didn't get that company to $900 million by accident,'' he said. If given the chance, he added, his family could have saved the company.</p>
        <p>In response to the inevitable comparisons with L.A. Gear, Skechers officials say their company is closely monitoring its growth, will license rather than make apparel and is just as popular with men as with women.</p>
        <p>Michael Greenberg founded Skechers -- street slang meaning frenetic teenagers -- in 1992, just months after leaving L.A. Gear. He convinced his father and David Weinberg, a former L.A. Gear executive whom he describes as a ''member of the family,'' to join his company in October 1993. Three of his brothers are currently vice presidents at Skechers; a fourth manages the Skechers Sport brand of sneakers.</p>
        <p>The company's sales grew steadily, as the Greenbergs capitalized on the shoe industry contacts they made in their years at L.A. Gear to make sure that Skechers displays were given prime retail space.</p>
        <p>Investors, however, were wary. When Skechers went public in June 1999, the company had reduced its asking price and the number of shares it offered. Even so, the stock lost value in its first day of trading. ''When a company prices at $11 and then opens trading at $10.50, that's generally kind of a sign of weakness,'' said Omar Sacirbey, a senior editor at The IPO Reporter.</p>
        <p>Robert Greenberg declined to comment. But Lloyd Grief, a close acquaintance of the family and president of Grief &amp; Company of Los Angeles, the investment bank that took L.A. Gear public in 1986, said, ''I think he was stunned with his stock's original reception.''</p>
        <p>Investors' fears seemed justified when, just as its predecessor had, Skechers ran into both inventory and legal troubles. Soon after the initial offering, the company reported losses for the third quarter of 1999, the period that is generally the strongest in the shoe industry because of back-to-school sales. The company had too many shoes in the retail channel and floundered when its platform sneakers fell out of style, problems eerily similar to those that had plagued L.A. Gear.</p>
        <p>''When you have that kind of situation, especially when it comes so soon after doing a public offering, institutions are very wary,'' said Harry Katica, vice president for research at Prudential Securities, one of Skechers' underwriters.</p>
        <p>Then, in December, a group of shareholders sued, contending that the company had misled investors by not disclosing in its initial filing that it was having legal problems with R. Griggs Group. Griggs, the maker of Doc Martens shoes, sued its former business partner five days after the offering, saying that Skechers had pirated its designs for men's boots. Skechers stock, which had been heading steadily downward, fell to its all-time low of $3.25 in January, after the company announced that two more shareholder suits had been filed. A total of five suits have now been filed; the consolidated lawsuit is pending.</p>
        <p>''The lawsuit is completely frivolous,'' Michael Greenberg said in a prepared statement. ''Skechers vehemently denies violating any of the security laws and believes all disclosures were made on a timely basis.''</p>
        <p>Now, the Greenbergs' luck may be beginning to change. In March, the company settled with Griggs and announced that 1999 net sales rose almost 14 percent from 1998, to $424.6 million, despite the unusually poor third quarter. The next month, the shares finally reached their initial public offering price. Then, in May, Skechers announced a blowout first quarter. All this good news has led many analysts to believe that Skechers may indeed be able to step out from behind the L.A. Gear shadow.</p>
        <p>Skechers, with its 900 styles, is doing a good job executing its strategy of being ''everyone and everything'' in footwear, said David Turner, an analyst at Ferris, Baker Watts.</p>
        <p>The company's newest styles, like its Energy gym shoes, have reignited interest among teenagers. They have gone from being on the ''uncool'' list last fall to the ''cool list'' this summer, said Kevin Ume, president of element Holdings Inc., a marketing firm that specializes in research on the buying habits of teenagers. During the back-to-school sales season, Skechers will even be displayed at the high-visibility area in Lady Foot Lockers where the mall meets the store, a coveted spot usually reserved for Nike.</p>
        <p>And right behind the teenagers are the investors, who seem willing to forget the past. ''Skechers has not been on our coverage list but in the last couple months it's just popped up,'' said Allison Boswell, president of Allison Boswell Consulting, a group that surveys shoe buyers. ''They were considered one of the top three fashion trend setting brands. They were also named as a brand that would be expected to have very high back-to-school increases.''</p>
        <p>Michael Greenberg notes with a broad smile that the company's stock is well above its initial price. The shares closed on Monday at $16.375, a high.</p>
        <p>Such successes are seen as vindication by the Greenbergs, who are dreaming big again. ''I think Wall Street understands one thing, and that's show me the numbers and deliver,'' Michael Greenberg said. ''I think they're getting on board.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 19, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about Skechers U.S.A., the shoe company, misstated its financial performance for the third quarter of 1999. The company had net income of $8.5 million, down $5 million from the quarter a year earlier. It did not report a loss.</p>
        <p>The article and a picture caption also misspelled the surname of the chief executive of Element Holdings Inc., a marketing firm, who commented on the popularity of the company's shoes. He is Kevin Umeh, not Ume.</p>
