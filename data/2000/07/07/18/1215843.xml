        <p>When Vinny Testaverde tried to put an end to the off-season caterwauling about the Jets trading their best player, he did it by making a rather blunt point: Keyshawn Johnson may have been the most exciting player, but he was not the most important one. That, Testaverde contended, was running back Curtis Martin, who carried the ball an average of 23 times a game last season, compared with fewer than 6 catches a game for Johnson.</p>
        <p>What, then, can Martin mean to the Jets this season, with Johnson gone, an undetermined receiving corps hoping to take his place, and an increased emphasis on Martin in the offing? What is bigger than a most valuable player? How does ''most desperately needed'' look on a plaque?</p>

        <p>When Vinny Testaverde tried to put an end to the off-season caterwauling about the Jets trading their best player, he did it by making a rather blunt point: Keyshawn Johnson may have been the most exciting player, but he was not the most important one. That, Testaverde contended, was running back Curtis Martin, who carried the ball an average of 23 times a game last season, compared with fewer than 6 catches a game for Johnson.</p>
        <p>What, then, can Martin mean to the Jets this season, with Johnson gone, an undetermined receiving corps hoping to take his place, and an increased emphasis on Martin in the offing? What is bigger than a most valuable player? How does ''most desperately needed'' look on a plaque?</p>
        <p>''I feel we'll all have to have more of a role,'' Martin said. ''Keyshawn, you can't take anything away from the guy. He's definitely a star. Any time you take someone away like that, people have to step up to take his place. We were glad to have had him, but we can do it without Keyshawn.''</p>
        <p>They will have to do it with Testaverde coming back from a torn Achilles' tendon and without, at least for now, an established backup for Martin. Leon Johnson was cut and Bernie Parmalee, who is more of a special teams player, is second on the depth chart.</p>
        <p>Fans wailing for Keyshawn Johnson may have overlooked Martin, but they will be unable to forget him this season. Whatever success the Jets are to have this season will depend more on how he does -- Coach Al Groh wants more of a ball-control offense -- than on which receivers step into the yawning breach created by Keyshawn Johnson's trade to the Buccaneers. While the fans at training camp watch how Testaverde drops back and to whom he rifles the ball, Martin continues to streak through the defense.</p>
        <p>Martin has always been one of the league's indomitable rushers, carrying the ball 367 times last season for 1,464 yards -- second only to Edgerrin James in yardage and carries in the National Football League. Martin has the Jets' record for yards in a season (1,464 in 1999) and attempts (369 in 1998). In his five-year career, Martin is averaging 339 carries a season. Over those first five years, Martin's 1,694 carries were the second-most in league history -- Eric Dickerson had 1,748. With Parmalee, who missed practice today with a sprained foot, behind him, Martin is likely to play even more.</p>
        <p>Groh is aware of how much wear Martin takes during a season, and he is preparing by trying to get Martin to ease up in training camp.</p>
        <p>''In season, we have to do what we have to do to win games,'' Groh said. ''He's a push-it-to-the-floor practice guy. As hard as he practices, we want to make sure he doesn't get worn out here.''</p>
        <p>Still, Martin wants to do more. He wants to become a better receiver out of the backfield. And when told that the assistant head coach and running backs coach Maurice Carthon said last week that with a few breaks and a few better blocks Martin could have rushed for 1,700 yards last season, Martin replied: ''If I'd have had 1,700, I would think with a break here or there I would have had even more yards. In my mind, I felt like a workhorse. I want to be a workhorse. When the day comes that I feel I can't carry that ball 400 times in a year, maybe that's the time for me to let football go. I don't see that anywhere near in the future.''</p>
        <p>Martin has long been a fan of synthetic grass, the brutal playing surface that many players blame for devastating injuries, because he thinks he can cut quickly on it and because he suspects it gives him a mental edge over players who fear knee and ankle injuries when they face him. But he thinks the change to natural grass, which replaces turf at the Meadowlands this year, is good for him and the Jets. The pounding Martin is sure to take this season will at least be less at the end of the run, if not in the statistics.</p>
        <p>''I realize I'm getting wiser about football,'' Martin said. ''I'm learning how to preserve my body. A lot of things used to take me so much work because I didn't have the knowledge to do it the most efficient way. I feel I have a more efficient football mind.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Tight end FRED BAXTER (strained quadriceps), the backup running back BERNIE PARMALEE (sprained foot) and the backup cornerback RAY MICKENS (strained hamstring) all missed practice today and are day to day. . . . Linebacker BRYAN COX had high praise for the rookie linebacker JOHN ABRAHAM, who has had several impressive practices. ''Abraham is going to be something special,'' Cox said. ''He gets off the ball in a hurry. He will be in the same mold as DERRICK THOMAS. Abraham has the same kind of explosiveness off the ball.'' . . . CURTIS MARTIN said that he still asks BILL PARCELLS for advice but that he notices the change without Parcells as coach. ''Life is calmer now,'' he said. . . . An M.R.I. on the left knee of the backup tackle GREG LOTYSZ showed complete tears of the anterior collateral ligament and the medial collateral ligament, as well as a partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament. He will have surgery in a week and miss the season. Lotysz was a practice-squad player last season.</p>
