        <p>As the Camp David summit meeting moved closer to a supposed deadline of President Clinton's Wednesday morning departure for Japan, the White House remained officially committed to reaching ''an agreement'' before then and talks shifted into high-drive for a crucial 48-hour period.</p>
        <p>But some American, Israeli and Palestinian officials today began deliberately lowering expectations for a breakthrough, even suggesting that additional summit meetings may be needed. And the White House left ample room for interpretation in its goal, since ''an agreement'' could include anything from a more modest declaration of principles to a full-blown accord between the two sides.</p>
        <p>Although American officials previously said quietly that President Clinton's itinerary could be modified, the White House continued to declare today that he has no intention of delaying his trip to a meeting of the leaders of the leading industrial nations in Okinawa or of sending Vice President Al Gore in his place.</p>
        <p>''The plan is to complete the process before the president goes,'' said his spokesman, Joe Lockhart. Later, Mr. Lockhart added: ''You will know we are following the schedule when you see the president walk up the steps of the plane, wave and the door close.''</p>
        <p>Several Middle East experts, however, including officials on all sides, find it hard to imagine that the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, could modify a well-documented personal history of pushing things to the wire. And in Mr. Arafat's case, that could mean an ultimate deadline not of Wednesday but of Sept. 13, by which he has pledged to declare a state.</p>
        <p>Some experts envisioned the leaders taking a break of a couple of weeks before reconvening for a continued summit meeting. But others said that this would be highly risky because it would expose what has been a completely secret, blacked-out negotiation to the leaks, misinformation, disinformation and political pressures of Israel and the Palestinian territories.</p>
        <p>''It's feasible to do that, to break off and then return,'' said a senior Israeli official. ''But I'm not sure it's a good idea to let the energy dissipate. The rumors and false assumptions could lead to terrible results.''</p>
        <p>Yitzhak Herzog, Israel's cabinet secretary, who is in Washington, said: ''It's clear that both parties must seize the moment, not only the moment, but literally the day. We should be thinking of Wednesday as a once-in-a-lifetime chance.''</p>
        <p>Still, the Israelis have been putting out the word that Prime Minister Ehud Barak ''is not going to stay forever at Camp David,'' and expressing frustration that, in their view, Mr. Barak has taken ''giant steps'' toward Mr. Arafat while the Palestinian leader has remained unyielding.</p>
        <p>''The Palestinians are not showing flexibility and are not going the extra mile,'' said Yuli Tamir, Israel's dovish immigration minister who is serving as an Israeli spokeswoman in Washington. ''I think they are pushing Barak to cross his red lines, and I think they are making a mistake. He will not change his mind.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Clinton has professed to be more optimistic than at the start of the summit meeting last Tuesday, Mr. Barak is ''more on the pessimistic side,'' Avraham Burg, Israel's Parliament speaker, told Israel Radio today.</p>
        <p>Other Israeli ministers and lawmakers who spoke to the prime minister expressed similar impressions.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians, who voiced unusual optimism late last week, today hit a peak of frustration, although it may have been short-lived. One Palestinian official who is not inside Camp David said that the Israelis seemed to be retreating on expected concessions. In talks leading up to the summit meeting the two sides had hammered out understandings on several key issues, understandings that may be reconfiguring themselves in the course of the current talks.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians have told the Americans that they do not plan to stay beyond Wednesday, the official said. Indeed, one senior Palestinian negotiator, Abu Mazen, who is the Palestine Liberation Organization's senior official after Mr. Arafat, faces a personal deadline. His son, Tarek, is getting married in Ramallah on Thursday, and the whole Palestinian team is invited and planning to attend.</p>
        <p>With Wednesday looming, the pace and intensity of the negotiations have quickened, and the teams worked until about 5 a.m. before breaking and resuming at midday. All three leaders are night owls, known to thrive in the post-midnight hours.</p>
        <p>Israeli and Palestinian officials outside the talks say that a kind of high-tension fatigue is setting in. Mr. Lockhart said, ''Coming back continually to the same issues with the same people, that kind of environment is not always the best for the warm and fuzzies.''</p>
        <p>Israel Radio reported tonight that while key differences remain on the thorniest issues of Jerusalem and the right of return of refugees, progress has been made on some relatively minor issues like water and the environment. Side talks are being held at a small college in Emmitsburg.</p>
        <p>But an American official there said that the side talks can only get so far without knowing the parameters of a core agreement, and Israeli and Palestinian participants who have longstanding professional relationships have been drafting and re-drafting individual paragraphs about some of those side issues, like civil affairs and economic relations.</p>
        <p>Rather than twiddle their thumbs, some Palestinian officials involved in the side talks have opted instead for long afternoons shopping at the Pentagon City mall in Virginia where many are staying, the American official said. (Some have been seeking wedding presents for Tarek Abbas, Abu Mazen's son.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak summoned a former director general of the foreign ministry from Israel, Reuven Merhak, who is also an expert on Jerusalem. He has been stationed at Emmitsburg since arriving. But Israeli analysts took his arrival as a sign that Mr. Barak wanted to have close by an analyst who has thought through all the solutions for sharing the holy city, including what Mr. Burg referred to recently as ''shrinking and expanding'' Jerusalem -- annexing Jerusalem suburbs in the West Bank to Israel while relinquishing Palestinian neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>The news blackout has held remarkably well through seven days, which most take as a good sign that no one wants to blow up the process. Inside Camp David, though, the delegations have ample access to American newspapers and 60 or 70 television channels, Mr. Lockhart said.</p>
