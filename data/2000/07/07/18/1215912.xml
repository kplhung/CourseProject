        <p>Buying the Dallas Mavericks may have been a fun way for Mark Cuban to spend some of the billion dollars he received after selling Broadcast.com to Yahoo, but the problem with athletes is they are so, well, analog. So leave it to Mr. Cuban find a way to make his new toy more high tech. He told a conference of Internet executives in Laguna Niguel, Calif., that he was going to put high-speed Internet jacks at each of the 20,000 seats of the team's new arena opening next year. Consumers will be able to plug in Palms or laptop computers to see statistics, player information, download a video of that amazing dunk, or play a video game on the jumbo screen during halftime against everyone else in the arena. And there's more. ''See a cute girl in the next section,'' Mr. Cuban said. ''Zap her an instant message, ''Hi. I'm Dave in row 37.''</p>
