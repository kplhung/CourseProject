        <p>Jon S. Corzine, who spent a record $36.7 million to win the Democratic primary for United States Senate, filed yesterday to sell $41 million worth of stock in Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, which he once headed.</p>

        <p>Jon S. Corzine, who spent a record $36.7 million to win the Democratic primary for United States Senate, filed yesterday to sell $41 million worth of stock in Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, which he once headed.</p>
        <p>A campaign spokesman said Mr. Corzine merely wanted to diversify his investment portfolio, but would not rule out the possibility that the candidate, who has lent his campaign $33 million so far, might use some of the proceeds to repay some of those debts to himself.</p>
        <p>The stock sale is expected to take place in a public offering in about two weeks. Goldman Sachs had offered its executives and former partners the opportunity to sell up to 15 percent of their shares, but in the end they were restricted to just under 10 percent, or 411,668 shares in Mr. Corzine's case. But Mr. Corzine and other Goldman Sachs current and former insiders may get to sell another batch of shares if the company finds demand for its shares great enough.</p>
        <p>Though he is selling more Goldman shares than any other individual, Mr. Corzine, who resigned as co-chairman after the firm went public in May 1999, will still be one of the biggest individual owners of Goldman Sachs stock. All told, he owns about 4.24 million shares, which are worth about $424 million at yesterday's closing price, $100 a share.</p>
        <p>Until now, Goldman Sachs' former partners and current executives have been prohibited from selling any stock in the firm. In connection with the initial stock offering, Goldman Sachs said in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that those insiders would hold their shares for at least three years.</p>
        <p>Goldman Sachs allowed only one previous exception to the restriction on stock transfers. Last year it allowed the former partners and current executives to give shares away for charitable reasons, a move that reduced the tax burdens the partners faced. Mr. Corzine donated about 175,000 shares to public charities and private foundations then, according to a document Goldman Sachs filed with the S.E.C.</p>
        <p>As of Saturday, when the Corzine campaign filed its latest financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission, it had spent $34.7 million and incurred an additional $2 million in debts, easily surpassing the spending record for an entire Senate campaign and more than quadrupling the previous mark for spending in a primary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine has lent more than $33 million to his campaign, but Mr. Shea said Mr. Corzine was in no hurry to pay himself back with proceeds from the stock sale. ''He hasn't decided yet how to reinvest this money, but he's not likely to use it to repay loans,'' Mr. Shea said.</p>
        <p>Also yesterday, Mr. Corzine's opponent in the November election, Representative Robert D. Franks, released his own F.E.C. filing showing he had spent $1.9 million winning the Republican primary. He actually had more cash on hand at the close of the reporting period Saturday -- $301,399 to Mr. Corzine's $211,862.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Franks, who earns $136,673 a year as a congressman, cannot lend so freely to himself. His fund-raising efforts are expected to kick into gear with an event honoring Senator John McCain later this month. Between the June 6 primary and the close of the reporting period on Saturday, Mr. Franks raised only $221,350, including $122,100 from political action committees and $99,250 in individual donations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's holdings in Goldman Sachs were worth about $234 million when Goldman Sachs went public in May 1999, ending the last major partnership on Wall Street. The stock price rose by about one third in its first day of trading and continued to rise into April, when it had nearly tripled in less than a year.</p>
        <p>The price momentarily fell two weeks ago, when the company announced that it would allow its former partners and current executives and two institutions that own large stakes in the firm to sell a total of about 40 million shares in a secondary public offering that is expected to occur in about two weeks. The insiders, who now are being allowed to sell 16.4 million shares, could get the right to sell another 6 million shares if the offering is oversubscribed by investors.</p>
        <p>Next week, Goldman Sachs officials will begin a tour of major financial centers to promote the stock offering. The price of the shares being sold will be determined after that. The sale, expected to occur in early August, could push down the price as the supply of stock available to the public increases.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 20, 2000, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about a move by Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for Senate from New Jersey, to sell $41 million worth of stock in the company he once headed, misstated the company's official name. It is the Goldman Sachs Group, not Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Also because of an editing error, the article omitted the full identification of Tom Shea, who said Mr. Corzine had not decided how to reinvest the proceeds. He is a spokesman for the Corzine campaign.</p>
