        <p>New York State's top education official threatened yesterday to take Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy to court if he continued to allow uncertified teachers to work in the city's failing schools this fall.</p>
        <p>Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, issued an order yesterday prohibiting Mr. Levy from allowing uncertified teachers to work in 99 troubled schools known as ''schools under registration review.''  Since September 1999, the state has required that only certified teachers be hired in those schools.</p>
        <p>But New York City violated the policy last year, hiring nearly 600 unlicensed teachers to work in underperforming schools because it could not find enough qualified teachers. Mr. Mills has repeatedly warned Mr. Levy that those teachers could not remain in the these schools, but he did not threaten legal action until yesterday.</p>
        <p>''Despite numerous conversations, I still have not been able to get assurance from Chancellor Levy that there won't be any more unqualified teachers in these schools in September,'' Mr. Mills said in an interview yesterday. ''So I had to bring it to conclusion with this order. I will go to court to enforce it, if it comes to that.''</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Levy said yesterday that of the 585 uncertified teachers hired to work in underperforming schools last year, roughly 250 had been reassigned. The remaining 335 have been ''strongly encouraged'' to apply to a new alternative certification program that was approved by the State Board of Regents last week, said Vicki Bernstein, an aide to Mr. Levy. She said that anyone who did  not qualify for the program would be dismissed or reassigned.</p>
        <p>To participate in the program, the 335 uncertified teachers would have to pass two state certification exams and take 200 hours of intensive training this summer.</p>
        <p>After meeting those requirements, the uncertified teachers would receive ''transitional certification,'' which would allow them to continue teaching in the underperforming schools while they took graduate education classes at the City University of New York. The Board of Education would pay for them to earn the equivalent of a master's degree.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mills predicted yesterday that many of the 335 uncertified teachers would not be able to pass the two exams and meet the training requirement by September.</p>
        <p>''It's important to realize that many of these people have repeatedly failed these certification tests,'' Mr. Mills said. ''It's unrealistic to expect that all of them will be admitted to an alternate route program.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills said the Board of Education should be trying to hire new teachers to work in schools under registration review. The new state budget includes $25 million for urban school districts to help recruit new teachers with signing bonuses and graduate tuition reimbursement, he said. And the state recently made it easier for New York City to hire certified teachers from other states, allowing them to begin teaching here immediately rather than waiting until they pass New York's certification exams.</p>
        <p>''I've done all that I can think of to help them,'' Mr. Mills said. ''And September is coming soon, and we can't get there and have this problem again. We're not going to let it go this time.''</p>
