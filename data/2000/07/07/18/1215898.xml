        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was fascinated by ''The Barefoot Seek Wiggle Room'' (news article, July 12). I grew up not far from Lombard, Ill., where one of the subjects of your article lives, and have been going barefoot much of the time for years.</p>
        <p>I also run outside in the snow, sometimes just to feed the birds, other times to hang the wash (yes,  I do that all year long), and it always feels so good when you come back inside to the warmth of the house.</p>
        <p>For women there are perhaps two problems for going barefoot frequently. One is that one's feet widen out and wider shoes are necessary. The other problem is for those dreaded times when one must wear nylons; rough, calloused feet can ruin a new pair immediately. Nevertheless, I would still prefer no shoes and wish that store owners were more tolerant!</p>
