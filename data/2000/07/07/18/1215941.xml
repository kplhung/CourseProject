        <p>Boomer Esiason returned to Monday night football yesterday, signing a two-year deal with CBS Radio Sports four months after being dropped from ABC's telecast.</p>
        <p>At CBS Radio, he will be teamed with Matt Millen and Howard David.</p>
        <p>Esiason said he did not believe his career as a football analyst was doomed after ABC fired him and he harshly criticized Al Michaels, his former partner, because he was solicited for the radio job shortly after his dismissal.</p>
        <p>''I thought he did a darn good job on ABC,'' said Joel Hollander, the president of CBS Radio Sports/Westwood One, who signed Esiason and expects him to help the broadcast acquire new sponsors.</p>
        <p>Esiason said he expects to act ''professionally'' each Monday night when he sees Michaels.</p>
        <p>''I can't worry about what's transpired,'' Esiason said. ''I'll be doing the Super Bowl, a conference championship game and I won't have to do any preseason. So I'm not worried about what's happened in the past.''</p>
