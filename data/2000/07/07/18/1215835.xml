        <p>In a sign that American drug companies are cracking open the Japanese market, Johnson &amp; Johnson will announce today that Tylenol will be available in Japan early this fall.</p>
        <p>Japan is the second largest market for over-the-counter drugs in the world. But for decades, the government has kept many foreign drug makers out. And, many drugs available to Europeans or Americans are not approved for sale in Japan.</p>
        <p>Tylenol has been available in the United States since 1955, and is now available in 46 countries.</p>
        <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson executives said yesterday that the company did not begin trying to get approval to sell Tylenol in Japan until 1995. In 1997, it signed a partnership agreement with Takeda Chemical Industries, Japan's largest drug company, to jointly market the pain reliever. The Japanese government agreed that the companies could sell Tylenol last year. Since that time, the companies have talked to more than 3,000 Japanese consumers to find out how best to market the pills.</p>
        <p>''There is a demanding government in Japan,'' said Fred Walker, marketing director for the company's McNeil Consumer Healthcare division in Japan. ''There is a demanding consumer. We needed to do our homework.''</p>
        <p>The leading over-the-counter pain reliever in Japan is now Bufferin, which is made by the Lion Corporation.</p>
        <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson will market Tylenol the same way similar drugs are sold in Japan. For example, the company will offer granules of Tylenol, flavored and packaged in an envelope, which quickly dissolve..</p>
        <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson officials would not disclose how much Tylenol it expects to sell in Japan or how much of the profits Takeda will get.</p>
        <p>For years, strict Japanese requirements for foreign drug companies have kept many popular medications out. A turning point came last year when Viagra, the anti-impotence drug, was quickly approved. The government then agreed that oral contraceptives could be sold. The contraceptives had been under review by the Japanese government for at least nine years.</p>
