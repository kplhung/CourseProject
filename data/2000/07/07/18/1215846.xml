        <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire today sentenced a former United States attorney and commodities regulator to 24 months in prison for becoming a co-conspirator with the operators of fraudulent telemarketing scams of the type he had once investigated and prosecuted.</p>
        <p>The sentence received by John A. Field III, 60, was a bit more than one-fourth of the maximum 87-month term he could have faced. It reflected his cooperation over a three-year period after he had been caught by federal investigators and agreed to cooperate in sting operations and the recording of telephone conversations. These led to the conviction of more than 18 fraudulent securities and commodities telemarketers in six states and the District of Columbia, who had netted nearly $200 million, prosecutors said.</p>

        <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire today sentenced a former United States attorney and commodities regulator to 24 months in prison for becoming a co-conspirator with the operators of fraudulent telemarketing scams of the type he had once investigated and prosecuted.</p>
        <p>The sentence received by John A. Field III, 60, was a bit more than one-fourth of the maximum 87-month term he could have faced. It reflected his cooperation over a three-year period after he had been caught by federal investigators and agreed to cooperate in sting operations and the recording of telephone conversations. These led to the conviction of more than 18 fraudulent securities and commodities telemarketers in six states and the District of Columbia, who had netted nearly $200 million, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Field also faces sentencing in a New Jersey federal court on other conspiracy charges connected to the telemarketing schemes, which were aimed at elderly people and often bilked them with the promise of windfall returns on their investments in fraudulent wireless cable, children's television programming and satellite broadcasting operations. Federal prosecutors in New Jersey are also expected to seek leniency at sentencing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Field was the United States attorney for the southern district of West Virginia from 1972 to 1977 and a former director of enforcement for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p>
        <p>In requesting leniency for him, federal prosecutors in Concord, N.H., conceded in a motion to Judge Joseph DiClerico that Mr. Field had let ''greed'' cancel out the years he spent protecting the public from fraud and wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>But they added in the motion:</p>
        <p>''While his crimes were egregious, his cooperation has been exceptional. With the help of Field, the government was able to quickly master the manner and methodology used by the criminal enterprise.''</p>
        <p>Michael J. Gunnison, an assistant United States Attorney in New Hampshire who helped investigate the cases that led to the fraud rings, said that Mr. Field, upon leaving his post as a regulator, had taken on the work of helping his clients in their intent to skirt and evade the laws regulating commodities.</p>
