        <p>It may be an overstatement to say, as the program notes for Lincoln Center Festival 2000 do, that electronic music has been marginalized in the world of art music. As the festival itself is demonstrating in its various offerings, a substantial body of electronic works have attained classic status, and composers continue to explore new sounds and technologies. Their work is no more marginal than most other currents of contemporary concert music, and composers like Steve Reich have had considerable success with electronic pieces.</p>
        <p>That said, electronic music has thrived better in pop, probably because pop is electronic by nature. Pop musicians amplify their instruments and use strings of sound processors, and their recordings are built of overdubbed layers of sound and a liberal use of effects. They have been electronic music productions in the truest since since at least the 1950's.</p>

Their work is no more marginal than most other currents of contemporary concert music, and composers like Steve Reich have had considerable success with electronic pieces.</p>
        <p>That said, electronic music has thrived better in pop, probably because pop is electronic by nature. Pop musicians amplify their instruments and use strings of sound processors, and their recordings are built of overdubbed layers of sound and a liberal use of effects. They have been electronic music productions in the truest since since at least the 1950's.</p>
        <p>The Saturday evening installment of the festival's electronic music series, ''The Turntable as Ensemble Instrument,'' celebrated the culture of the D.J. -- or turntablism, as the program book suggests -- a comparatively recent contribution from the pop world to the electronic dialogue.</p>
        <p>In days of yore a D.J., or disc jockey, was someone who played records on the radio or at a party, usually using two turntables and a small mixing box that allowed him to segue smoothly (or crossfade) between one selection and the next. In the 1980's hip-hop D.J.'s revised the job description: they have kept the turntables, vinyl LP's and mixers, but instead of letting the records play, they have hijacked them as sources of raw material -- riffs, rhythms, patches of timbre and occasionally melodic fragments -- that can be manipulated by moving the turntable forward and backward by hand and by working the balance and volume controls on the mixer.</p>
        <p>It is a way of making music from music already made, and detractors might regard that as cannibalistic. But watching the performers on Saturday, particularly the X-Ecutioners, one developed a respect for the musicality, imagination and sheer hand-ear coordination involved.</p>
        <p>Yet one thing the program showed was that there is nothing new under the sun. The curtain raiser was John Cage's ''Imaginary Landscape No. 5,'' a 1952 work to be performed with samples ''from any 42 phonograph records.'' George Steel conducted an ensemble of four D.J.'s -- D.J. A. Vee, D.J. Frankie, Kuttin' Kandi and Christian Marclay -- in three versions of the piece, one using jazz recordings (as Cage did), one using classic electronic music recordings and one using hip-hop rhythms. Curiously the most ''authentic'' reading, the one using jazz discs, was the least effective.</p>
        <p>As a novelty offering Sugarcuts and Fifth Platoon (D.J. Complex, Daddy Dog and Roli Rho) presented a nominally recognizable version of Rossini's ''William Tell'' Overture, prefaced by an amusing rhythmic jam. And there was an ambitious hybrid of conventional composition and turntablism, Raz Mesinai's ''String Quartet for Four Turntables.''</p>
        <p>The string instruments were recorded, and the recordings (on LP) were manipulated by D.J. Olive, Toshio Kajiwara and Mr. Mesinai. But the string timbres were not unlike what one might hear in a standard contemporary quartet performance, and in the absence of the swishing rhythmic sounds typical of hip-hop, it was difficult to tell what the turntable performance added.</p>
        <p>Far and away the most gripping performance was ''Deconstructing the Blues on Four Turntables'' a 40-minute tour of turntable techniques by the X-Ecutioners (Mista Sinista, Roc Raida, Total Eclipse and Rob Swift). The backbone of the piece, created for the festival, was an ensemble section full of complex crossrhythms. But its heart was a string of virtuosic and often choreographed solo turns.</p>
        <p>Between the selections Somatic provided  an ambient rhythmic mix.</p>
