        <p>The answer to the question of whether Hillary Rodham Clinton ever made the anti-Semitic slur attributed to her by two long-time enemies from Arkansas politics may forever be lost to time and the conflicting accounts of what actually went on the night that Bill Clinton lost his first race for Congress in 1974.</p>
        <p>But the fact that Mrs. Clinton felt compelled, at the near-unanimous urging of her senior advisers, to call reporters to her home on a Sunday afternoon to explicitly deny the charges, and that President Clinton took a break from Middle East negotiations to telephone a Daily News editor to back up his wife, reflects more than passing concern over the latest storm to pass over Mrs. Clinton's campaign. Their actions suggest what her advisers said yesterday was the need to address persistent doubts about this candidate among Jewish voters, and, more fundamentally, lingering doubts about her trustworthiness across the electoral spectrum.</p>

        <p>The answer to the question of whether Hillary Rodham Clinton ever made the anti-Semitic slur attributed to her by two long-time enemies from Arkansas politics may forever be lost to time and the conflicting accounts of what actually went on the night that Bill Clinton lost his first race for Congress in 1974.</p>
        <p>But the fact that Mrs. Clinton felt compelled, at the near-unanimous urging of her senior advisers, to call reporters to her home on a Sunday afternoon to explicitly deny the charges, and that President Clinton took a break from Middle East negotiations to telephone a Daily News editor to back up his wife, reflects more than passing concern over the latest storm to pass over Mrs. Clinton's campaign. Their actions suggest what her advisers said yesterday was the need to address persistent doubts about this candidate among Jewish voters, and, more fundamentally, lingering doubts about her trustworthiness across the electoral spectrum.</p>
        <p>For most public figures, a charge of the sort raised -- that she made an obscenity-laden anti-Semitic remark to Mr. Clinton's campaign manager 26 years ago -- might have sunk out of sight. It is an old anecdote coming out a little more than three months before an election. It is made by two people with a history of enmity toward President and Mrs. Clinton, and repeated by a third person who said he overheard the conversation from outside the room.</p>
        <p>The book where the incident was first recounted, ''State of a Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton,'' is written by a former reporter for The National Enquirer, Jerry Oppenheimer, as Mrs. Clinton's aides have been quick to note in an attempt to question its credibility. The alleged recipient of the anti-Semitic slur is Baptist, though he says his paternal great-grandmother is Jewish.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton and her campaign team found themselves answering questions about it for the fourth day yesterday, evidence that the charge was not being dismissed as implausible. And Representative Rick A. Lazio, her Republican opponent who had stepped back when the allegations first emerged, addressed the issue yesterday in what his aides said would be a continuing attempt to use it to raise questions about Mrs. Clinton's honesty.</p>
        <p>''There have been three people that have made what I think is a serious allegation,'' Mr. Lazio said outside a school in Harlem. ''Mrs. Clinton has denied that allegation. I don't know who to believe. I don't know if New Yorkers know who to believe. And therein lies a good deal of the problem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's senior campaign consultant, Mike Murphy, said, ''I have no doubt now that trust is becoming the major issue of the campaign.''</p>
        <p>Her advisers reacted quickly to  this latest allegation precisely because her credibility has been challenged so regularly over the past eight years, and that she could not afford at this time in her campaign another episode that raised questions about her sincerity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton called an editor of The Daily News on his own accord on Sunday, according to the first lady's advisers, who suggested yesterday that presidential intervention might not have been called for. They would not speculate as to why Mr. Clinton made the call.</p>
        <p>But when it came to the first lady, Mrs. Clinton and her advisers made a very deliberate calculation to rebut the story after determining that it  could become a brush fire.</p>
        <p>The decision came Sunday in a late-morning telephone conference call between Mrs. Clinton and her aides, after her aides watched as Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, declared on ''Fox News Sunday'' that Representative Rick A. Lazio, Mrs. Clinton's Republican opponent, was getting substantial support from  Jewish voters in New York, ''and I think that's one of the reasons why Hillary is uttering these anti-Semitic comments, if in fact she is.''</p>
        <p>By that point on Sunday, the story had appeared on the Drudge Report on the Internet, in The New York Post and in The Daily News, but Mrs. Clinton's advisers figured that it was only a matter of time before it spilled over into other newspapers, the Associated Press and local television news. They agreed that Mrs. Clinton needed to personally rebut a charge that was already stirring concern among some of her Jewish supporters, and seemed not to be going away any time soon.</p>
        <p>''The concept here is, let's not have any whispering campaigns,'' one of Mrs. Clinton's senior advisers said yesterday. ''Let's get the truth out. Let's not allow false information promoted by a book to be used in a whispering campaign.''</p>
        <p>Some of Mrs. Clinton's associates had worried that such a quick and heated reaction would only draw additional attention to the story. And Mr. Murphy suggested last night that the mere fact of a president interrupting Middle East negotiations to call a newspaper editor gave new life to a story that might have been on the decline.</p>
        <p>What is more, for all their concern, reaction among Jewish leaders has been relatively mild. Assemblyman Dov Hikind, the Brooklyn Democrat who represents an Orthodox neighborhood, said yesterday that the incident raised ''the whole issue of credibility in terms of things that Hillary Clinton says and does.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hikind, who has been wary of Mrs. Clinton's views on Israel, given her support for a Palestinian state, went out of his way to say he did not consider her anti-Semitic. A number of Jewish organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee, issued statements supporting  Mrs. Clinton last night.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said yesterday that she was seeking to move beyond questions about what she had said to Paul Fray, Mr. Clinton's campaign manager from 1974. She looked momentarily startled when told what Mr. Lazio had said about her credibility, but then said: ''I'm not going to respond to that. I said yesterday that it was untrue, it did not happen and I think it's regrettable that there is an accusation of that banality that is made.''</p>
        <p>But one of Mrs. Clinton's most long-term advisers, James Carville, said yesterday that given the Clintons' history in politics, and voters' fascination and polarized views of the two particular politicians, he did not believe this would go away any time soon. ''My counsel to them is that this is only the beginning.''</p>
