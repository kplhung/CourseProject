        <p>The Arkansas that Bill and Hillary Clinton used to live in does not seem to have been part of normal reality. It's more of a parallel universe, like the one the wizards inhabit in Harry Potter books, only uncharming.</p>
        <p>Revisit the Arkansas of the 70's and 80's, as we have been forced to do on a regular basis for the last eight years, and it appears that the entire state consisted of only about 100 extremely talkative people, all of them either emotionally disturbed or teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>The rest of the planet has moved on since the days when Bill Clinton was an Arkansas pol, but that little world stays in place, chewing on bitter herbs and drinking from the Well of Recovered Memories. This week it spit out another new recollection, via Jerry Oppenheimer's ''State of a Union,'' a book about the Clintons' marriage that reports that Hillary used an anti-Semitic epithet in 1974.</p>
        <p>This is a very big week for Clinton literature. Today marks the unveiling of Joe Eszterhas's ''American Rhapsody,'' a book that answers the oft-posed question ''What does the writer of the movie 'Basic Instinct' make of the Monica Lewinsky affair?'' Mr. Eszterhas offers several new anecdotes about Sharon Stone, takes the reader on a pretend-journey through the sexual reveries of important Republicans, and claims that Steven Spielberg would have produced his screenplay about a fictional president who practices bestiality if only he had not been afraid of upsetting the Clintons.</p>
        <p>But we digress. The anti-Semitism charge comes from Paul and Mary Lee Fray, two of the chattiest charter citizens in the Razorback version of ''The Land That Time Forgot.'' The Frays figure prominently in just about every Clinton tome ever written except ''It Takes a Village.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fray ran Bill Clinton's unsuccessful Congressional campaign in 1974 while his wife was delegated to give Hillary hints about nail polish and accessorizing. On the night that the campaign ended in defeat, the two couples had a knock-down-drag-out fight that has become one of the great set pieces of Clinton legend. It ended spectacularly when the enraged Mary Lee decided to enlighten Hillary about Bill's other girlfriends, past and present.</p>
        <p>Over the years Mr. Fray has helped inquiring reporters with stories about Bill Clinton's womanizing, drug use among campaign workers and rumors in Arkansas that Hillary was a lesbian. The anti-Semitic angle never came up. But in the universe where the Frays dwell, the past is process, and their latest recounting of the great fight begins with Hillary storming into the campaign headquarters and denouncing the stunned Mr. Fray as a ''[expletive deleted] Jew bastard.''</p>
        <p>That would have been a terrible, ugly moment if Mr. Fray was actually a Baptist with a Jewish father, as he told Mr. Oppenheimer. It would be very bad even if Mr. Fray's Jewish lineage was confined to one great-grandmother, as he told The Times this week. But you would have to presume that Hillary, a self-absorbed 26-year-old, was devoting an enormous amount of attention to the details of her boyfriend's campaign manager's family tree.</p>
        <p>At an emotional press conference over the weekend, Mrs. Clinton denied the Frays' charges, and her outrage seemed genuine, just as it did earlier this year when Rudy Giuliani accused her of being an enemy of religion. After years of dodging allegations about White House cover-ups and health care screw-ups and questionable profits on cattle futures, Hillary Clinton has enjoyed several opportunities during her New York Senate campaign to deny responsibility for things she actually did not do.</p>
        <p>Nobody else has come forward with another example of Mrs. Clinton ever having made an anti-Semitic statement, and friends of the First Lady went out of their way to recount instances in which she'd angrily used salty language in a slur-free context. (''I remember streams of obscenities!'' one overenthused.) A former Arkansas campaign aide, meanwhile, jumped in on the side of the Frays. In the end, the public will have to decide for itself whether Hillary Clinton, one of the most politically correct people on the planet, chose to express her anger 25 years ago by homing in on the ethnicity of a guy's great-grandmother.</p>
        <p>There's no way to prove a negative. But if you buy this one, I've got some information on the murder of Vince Foster by the Israeli Secret Service that you'll really enjoy.</p>
