        <p>American athletes have won medals in the Olympics after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs in Olympic qualification trials, a former senior official of the United States Olympic Committee said in a lawsuit against the committee filed today here in federal district court.</p>
        <p>The official, Dr. Wade Exum, who served the U.S.O.C. for nine years as director of drug control administration, charged that the Olympic committee has essentially ignored test results that would otherwise have led to sanctions against athletes. This was a strategy, he asserts, that effectively encouraged athletes to use illegal drugs to improve their performances.</p>
        <p>''The U.S.O.C. has thrown roadblocks in the path of antidoping enforcement,''  Exum said in a 31-page complaint that seeks compensation for what he described as wrongful termination, in part because he is black. ''In recent years absolutely no sanction has been imposed on roughly half of all the American athletes who have tested positive for prohibited substances.''</p>
        <p>Exum, who was dismissed on June 5, further said he had uncovered ''scores'' of athletes who tested positive for testosterone, an illegal substance that is especially popular among track and field athletes, but never became aware of any sanction by the Olympic committee. He also said that athletes continued to use synthetic testosterone without fear of punishment.</p>
        <p>Norm Blake, chief executive of the United States Olympic Committee, said in a statement that upon quick review of the lawsuit, he found the complaint to be ''without merit,'' adding that committee lawyers would offer a proper response in time.</p>
        <p>Blake also criticized Exum for filing the lawsuit less than two months before the opening of the Olympics in Sydney, Australia, a time frame that would result in  ''unwarranted allegations'' and tarnish the reputation of athletes and their supporters.</p>
        <p>Neither Exum, 51, a medical doctor and psychiatrist who was hired by the Olympic committee in 1991, nor his lawyer was available for comment. The lawyer, John W. McKendree, was out of town, and Exum said in a statement that he would have nothing to say publicly about the lawsuit before a news conference Friday. Last month, Exum made similar accusations in a letter made public by his lawyer.</p>
        <p>In his lawsuit, Exum declined to mention any athletes by name or sport. But his allegations paint a particularly harsh picture of a drug enforcement system designed to do anything but enforce regulations. His charges suggest that American athletes who use illegal substances have nothing to fear from the Olympic authorities and that any time he tried to intercede to improve the system he was undercut by superiors.</p>
        <p>He also repeated a familiar concern raised by other critics of the United States drug-fighting efforts over the years, that by paying two laboratories to analyze urine samples for possible drug use, the Olympic committee engages in a conflict of interest that removes any incentive for lab directors to develop better tests or technologies that might discourage drug use.</p>
        <p>The overall result, he claimed, has led to ''arbitrary and capricious results with improperly lenient treatment for certain athletes presumed positive for performance enhancing drugs and with most athletes receiving such light punishments, or no punishments, as to encourage the use of prohibited performance enhancing drugs or doping methods.''</p>
        <p>As a further consequence of the Olympic committee's problems fighting illegal drugs, he said, his efforts have ''lost international credibility'' and his own reputation has suffered.</p>
        <p>In addition to allegations about drug-testing procedures, Exum charged that many of his problems working for the Olympic committee reflected his race, which he claimed was the sole reason he was denied promotion to chief medical officer. Four times, he said, control over the budget for his activities was controlled by white administrators, one of whom, James Page, had been barred for life from the national and international governing bodies of skiing for his role in an athlete's drug use.</p>
        <p>Exum said all four of his white superiors were variously promoted over him or given authority over the committee's sports medicine and drug control functions even though none had a medical degree or expertise in drug-fighting strategies.  Exum said that he, on the other hand, was often criticized for not being ''a team player,'' which led him to conclude that his race had cost him any opportunity to advance.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit makes eight charges against the Olympic committee, including misrepresentation, wrongful termination and racial discrimination.</p>
