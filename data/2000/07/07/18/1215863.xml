        <p>In an attempt to anchor a Police Department adrift in management and morale problems, Hartford's city manager stripped Acting Chief Deborah Barrows of her job today and promoted a captain to replace her for the next two months.</p>
        <p>The new acting chief, Robert Rudewicz, 41, an 18-year veteran of the force, is expected to keep the job until September, when city officials expect to complete their nationwide search for a permanent chief, Saundra Kee Borges, Hartford's city manager, said at a hastily called news conference this afternoon.</p>
        <p>The demotion of Chief Barrows to captain -- the rank she held when she was appointed acting chief in April 1999 to replace Joseph Croughwell Jr., who left on medical leave and never returned -- underscores City Hall's mounting frustration with her leadership. Today's move came one week after Connecticut's chief state's attorney, John M. Bailey, publicly demanded that the Hartford police hand over more than $775,000 in money and property confiscated from suspects taken into custody since April 1999.</p>
        <p>Minutes before Ms. Barrows was to meet with city officials this morning to discuss her job performance, the officials received a notice saying she was taking a 10-day medical leave of absence; she sought medical attention at a hospital over the weekend, complaining of chest pains. She has not been heard from since, said Ms. Kee Borges, adding that she had tried to inform Ms. Barrows of her decision today by telephone, pager and hand-delivered letter, all without success.</p>
        <p>Reached by telephone this evening, Ms. Barrows's husband, Frank Barrows, speaking for his wife, said today's events were ''devastating'' to her. He said she would return to work after her leave and support the new acting chief. But he added, ''The city is going to suffer, because she was a good chief, she was out there, making a difference.''</p>
        <p>The appointment of the third Hartford police chief in 15 months is seen in City Hall and in the Police Department as a desperate but necessary move to create a sense of stability and, eventually, pride -- two elements long missing.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, this move signals this council's and this administration's resolve in helping to bring confidence again back to the Hartford Police Department,'' said City Councilman Steven M. Harris, who heads the council's Public Safety Committee. ''We need to settle this ship down and take control of the situation.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kee Borges said the removal of Ms. Barrows from the city's top police job had nothing to do with her performance. ''It's about my decision that we need to move on, that we need to do some things in the department differently,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But it has been no secret that under Ms. Barrows's command, the Hartford police inspired more scorn than confidence in city officials and community leaders. Last October, for example, an independent auditor presented city officials with a thick report exposing serious deficiencies in the department, including a lack of control over officers on patrol, excessive overtime payments and the theft, still unsolved, of $86,000 from the department's evidence room.</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Barrows's defenders say she inherited many of the worst problems from Chief Croughwell, Ms. Kee Borges and others have repeatedly complained that Ms. Barrows was inaccessible and unresponsive, and did little to change the department's image.</p>
        <p>In May, for instance, in a move that infuriated neighborhood residents, Ms. Barrows dismantled three police substations, despite the auditor's recommendations against doing so, without telling Ms. Kee Borges or anyone on the City Council.</p>
        <p>Last week, city officials acknowledged that they were examining Ms. Barrows's time cards for possible abuses of the department's limits on compensatory time.</p>
        <p>Acting Chief Rudewicz, who learned that he was being given the top police job an hour before appearing before a dozen reporters at City Hall, would not specify what his first moves in the new position would be, saying only that he wanted ''to focus in on some of the ongoing problems that we have and get those resolved as quickly as possible.''</p>
        <p>''Obviously, I have a lot to digest,'' he said, standing straight as a rifle barrel, in a shirt and tie and white canvas pants, his hands clasped in front of him. ''This came as quite a surprise to me.'' Later, he added, ''Quite honestly, it's going to be a one-day-at-a-time proposition.''</p>
        <p>In addition to naming a new acting chief, Ms. Kee Borges said she had tapped her assistant city manager, Jim Wright, to act as an informal but keen overseer of the department's day-to-day operations. ''Clearly the department is facing a lot of challenges,'' Mr. Wright said.</p>
        <p>Many of the department's most vocal critics, who include Mayor Mike Peters, say they believe that the department's problems run so deep that they will ultimately require a strong chief from outside the department. Though Mr. Rudewicz is to remain chief for only two months, he will be given the chance to make a  significant change in the department: creating a team of top police officials to carry out the new chief's commands.</p>
        <p>The formation of the team, which Ms. Kee Borges also announced today, will begin immediately, Mr. Wright said, and should provide a better chain of command in a department with only one acting chief, one acting assistant chief and five captains.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to fix the department in two months,'' Chief Rudewicz said. But, he added, ''I'm confident that people within the department are going to step up to the plate.''</p>
        <p>He wasted little time planning his first full day on the job. Within two hours of his appointment, he had already scheduled a meeting with Mr. Bailey, the state's attorney, on Tuesday morning to discuss fixing the department's problems in handling and delivering confiscated money to the state.</p>
