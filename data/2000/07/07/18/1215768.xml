        <p>Did Roger Clemens throw his fastball at Mike Piazza's head on purpose during the recent subway series? Piazza thinks he did, and others are suspicious. But only Clemens knows for sure.</p>
        <p>Does it matter? For a reader with limited tolerance for sports-hero coverage the main accomplishment of this incident is to awaken memories of Ring Lardner, who was not merely America's incomparable analyst of a pitcher's psyche but of much else about the America of his time and ours.</p>
        <p>In Lardner's acid-etched portrait, ''You Know Me Al: A Busher's Letters,'' Jack Keefe, the letter-writing White Sox pitcher, announces right out that if he had known that Joe Hill, a rival left-hander, had stolen his girl, Violet, ''I would of made Callahan,'' the Sox manager, ''pitch me against him.'' He continues: ''And when he come up to bat I would of beaned him. But I don't suppose you could hurt him by hitting him in the head.''</p>
        <p>It is just Jack's bad luck that when he finally gets sufficiently steamed up actually to bean Joe Hill, the game is tied and the bases are loaded. ''I catched him square on the fourhead and he dropped like as if he had been shot. But pretty soon he gets up and gives me the laugh and runs to first base.'' That gets Jack suspended without pay.</p>
        <p>Joe Hill, along with many others, stirs up Jack's visions of violent retribution: ''I don't know what for but I felt like busting his jaw only the boys told me I had better not do nothing because I might kill him.''</p>
        <p>Ballplayers' syntax has been smoothed over considerably since Lardner's Jack was in the big leagues in 1914; these days interviews with athletes mostly sound as though they were pitched by the same hand, with a spin for a clean public image. Even John Rocker has been tamed. The price or the reward has been a blandness of personality.</p>
        <p>Whether in the majors or in exile in a bush league, however, Jack is distinctive in his hapless way. Not for Lardner was the sentimental celebration in which others of the sportswriting fraternity indulge. To call him a sportswriter is like calling F. Scott Fitzgerald a gossip columnist. The critic Maxwell Geismar was not overstating when he credited Lardner with being ''one of the most savage and merciless satirists and social critics of his period who dissected Babbitt before Babbitt was born.'' Lardner was cruelly comical. Jack's skirmish with Joe Hill is an affair of the heart, but his typical reaction to competitors on field and off, and to slights imagined and only too real, take the form of dreams of physical retaliation. Take the time when Allen, Jack's teammate on Chicago's pitching staff, buys a big diamond ring for his girlfriend Marie and makes Jack look cheap in front of his wife, Florrie, who is Marie's sister.</p>
        <p>Jack writes to his pal, the ever-sympathizing and accommodating Al: ''I guess all these lefthanders is alike though I thought this Allen had some sense. I thought he was different from the most and was not no rummy but they are all alike Al and they are all lucky that somebody don't hit them over the head with a ax and kill them but I guess at that you could not hurt no lefthanders by hitting them over the head.''Unable to take vengeance by beaning a teammate, Jack consoles himself that ''Allen has not got nothing but a dinky curve ball and a fast ball that looks like my slow one.'' Allen's curve ball, he reports to Al, ''has not got no more smoke than a rabbit or something.'' It was such inventions that inspired Geismar to credit Lardner with creating ''a new American language that made Hemingway's look like parlor conversation.''</p>
        <p>Anyway, with the exception of the Joe Hill beaning mishap, Jack would never admit to throwing a fastball at a batter's head on purpose because that would imply he was afraid to pitch to the plate, which Jack, who comes on with claims to being the best in any league, except when his arm hurts, is not about to admit.</p>
        <p>His epistolary outbursts are generally connected to rebuffs in romance brought on by a severe case of stinginess; he is a tightwad who suspects that some sharpie or fickle girlfriend is always trying to put one over on him.</p>
        <p>When Allen smacks him after Jack threatens to bust Marie's jaw, his account betrays Jack as a blowhard who has rarely delivered a hard blow: ''Well Al I am not going to stand that from nobody not even if he is my brother-in-law and a lefthander that has not got enough speed to brake a pain of glass. So I give him a good beating and the waiters butts in and puts us all out for fighting and I and Florrie comes home in a taxi and Allen and his wife don't get in till about 5 oclock so I guess she must of had to of took him to a doctor to get fixed up. I been in bed ever since till just this morning kind of sick to my stumach. I guess I must of eat something that did not agree with me.''</p>
        <p>Jack is matchless when it comes to self-advertisement and self-revelation. The combination of cheapness and bluster, of all-purpose hostility and infallible miscalculation, delivered in inimitably Lardnerian prose, make Jack an exasperating yet endearing and enduring figure, propelled on a sure road to destruction. He can't figure out why people so often seem to be laughing at him.</p>
        <p>Readers laughed, too, and by the end of his classic tale we know the poor jerk and the America that he represents a lot better than Al ever can.</p>
