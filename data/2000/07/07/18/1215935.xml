        <p>Hugo Boss, the fashion designer, is finally opening a flagship store in Manhattan, among some of the most expensive shopping real estate in the country.</p>
        <p>Boss signed a lease last week for a 23,000-square-foot store at 717 Fifth Avenue, at the southeast corner of 56th Street.

        <p>Hugo Boss, the fashion designer, is finally opening a flagship store in Manhattan, among some of the most expensive shopping real estate in the country.</p>
        <p>Boss signed a lease last week for a 23,000-square-foot store at 717 Fifth Avenue, at the southeast corner of 56th Street. The four-story store, which will have a 40-foot ceiling and an atrium, is in a neighborhood that includes Harry Winston jewelers, Bulgari, Tiffany and Prada, plus two of the most lucrative stores in the Gap and Banana Republic chains.</p>
        <p>Jedd Nero, executive vice president of Newmark New Spectrum Retail, the broker for Boss, said the store will have a small cafe and carry men's clothing as well as a new line of women's fashions.</p>
        <p>''This will be one of the largest designer stores in the country,'' he said. ''And it'll be twice as big as any of the 300 existing Boss stores.''</p>
        <p>Storefront rents in the area, which attracts tourists and well-heeled shoppers, have soared to more than $600 a square foot, or double what retailers are paying in Times Square.</p>
        <p>''Fashion retailers are still committed to being on Fifth Avenue no matter what the price,'' said Robert K. Futterman, a retail broker who was not involved in the deal. ''It's still a place where people want to make a statement.''</p>
