        <p>With his team tied with Kansas City for the most points in Major League Soccer, MetroStars General Manager Nick Sakiewicz paid little attention yesterday to a report in a German magazine that quoted Lothar Matthaus as saying he expected to leave the Metro-</p>
        <p>Stars in a couple of days.</p>
        <p>Sakiewicz said he was busy with several team projects and had little time to be dealing daily with Matthaus, who is out with a slipped disk that causes lower-back spasms. ''I talk to him about his injury every day and he tells me it stinks,'' Sakiewicz said yesterday from his office.</p>
        <p>''I'm concerned about his health and others are concerned about his getting fired,'' Sakiewicz said of Matthaus, 39. ''We never talk about that. All we talk about is the options about his injury. Maybe it's a season-ending injury; maybe we put him on the 15-day injured reserve list. Maybe it's his career.''</p>
        <p>The German magazine Kicker quoted Matthaus as saying: ''I don't need the MetroStars and they don't need me. It looks like we will reach a reasonable agreement on separation on Wednesday.''</p>
        <p>After the MetroStars' 2-0 triumph in Boston, Sakiewicz said that a decision on Matthaus would be made by tomorrow, but yesterday he said he had no timetable.</p>
        <p>The general feeling within the team is that they do not need Matthaus because the MetroStars have gone 9-1-1 without him. They are 3-6-1 with Matthaus in the line up.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars accomplished their last victory without Tab Ramos and Clint Mathis, who are with the national team for World Cup qualifying games.</p>
