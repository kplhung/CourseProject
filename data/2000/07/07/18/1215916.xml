        <p>EARLIER this week, Inger Miller and Chryste Gaines were explaining how they had earned their places on the United States Olympic team after finishing second and third in the 100-meter final.</p>
        <p>Half an hour earlier, Marion Jones had smoked Miller and Gaines to win the race going away. Finally Jones walked in, and all lights shifted from Miller and Gaines to her. The three runners tried their best to make nice.</p>
        <p>The inevitable questions came up about Jones's winning five gold medals at the Sydney Games in September.</p>
        <p>Jones forced a smile. ''If I had a penny for every time I was asked that question, I'd be rich,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Gaines and Miller glanced over and said in unison, ''You're not?''</p>
        <p>Everyone including Jones laughed.</p>
        <p>''That may have been a bad choice of words,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>That was the mildest form all week of the sort of trash-talking and sniping that punctuated the sprinting competition among American sprinters. Even Michael Johnson has fired salvos at Maurice Greene, among others. He chided Greene for being less than mature and said Miller needed to be more focused and wondered whether she would even make the team.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Miller, who has publicly complained about Jones's high visibility, said Johnson's hair must have been braided too tightly.</p>
        <p>For former Olympians like Alice Coachman and Wyomia Tyus, the trash-talking is almost embarrassing. The sniping has assumed a sort of plantation humor, with the athletes goaded into sniping at each other largely for the entertainment of the Big House.</p>
        <p>Tyus, the first female sprinter to win 100-meter gold medals in back-to-back Olympics (1964 and 1968), was a protegee of  Wilma Rudolph.</p>
        <p>''When Wilma was in school, during her era, they were talkers, they sold 'wolf tickets' and they took names,'' she said. ''But it was never those snide remarks. Even when I was competing, we didn't have that. If somebody did something you didn't like or if you thought somebody was getting more publicity -- hey, that's just her day. Your day is coming.''</p>
        <p>Coachman and Tyus said that trash-talking is as old and primal as racing itself.</p>
        <p>In the 1948 London Games, Coachman, a high jumper, became the first African-American woman to win a gold medal. She was also the only American woman to win a track and field gold that year.</p>
        <p>In the months leading up to the 1948 Games, a couple of opponents had public things to say about beating Coachman, who was also an extraordinary sprinter. There was one vocal competitor in particular.</p>
        <p>''Mickey Patterson,'' she said, referring to a friend and rival, who died in 1996. ''When I first met Mickey, she was winning all these 100- yard dashes. She was going around talking: 'I'm going to beat Alice Coachman, she's not that tough. I'm going to beat her.' ''</p>
        <p>At one meet, Patterson told everyone that she was going to beat Coachman.</p>
        <p>''I said that's fine,'' Coachman, 76, said. ''She tried to beat me, but she couldn't. But she was the one that was talking about how she was going to beat me, just like a lot of them are doing about Marion Jones.''</p>
        <p>''That was the extent of it then,'' Coachman added. ''Now it's a little different because money's involved. ''Everybody's trying to win; if you don't win, that money's not there. Most big companies won't promote a person who's not a winner.''</p>
        <p>Trash-talking has become another commodity to be marketed, like soft drinks and outerwear. Most peculiar is not the athletes' talking but the news media reaction to it. The same media that despised trash-talk as a signature of massive cultural dysfunction now embraces it.</p>
        <p>''Athletes are doing nothing new,'' said John Smith, a former sprinter who coaches Greene and others. ''It was always like, 'Man, I'll beat you.' 'Oh, yeah? Watch. Come on out here.'</p>
        <p>''Only now two reporters are standing there, one of them sensationalizes it, then it becomes a competition between the media for who can put out the best sensationalized information to draw the public in.''</p>
        <p>Coachman wasn't really buying that. She thought there was something demeaning, belittling about all the personal trash-talking.</p>
        <p>Would she be any different if she were competing in this generation? Coachman laughed. ''If money was involved,'' she said, ''I would have been talking trash, too.''</p>
