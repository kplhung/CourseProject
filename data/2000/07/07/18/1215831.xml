        <p>Nearly a month after one of the largest insurers in the United States agreed to pay more than $215 million in penalties and restitution to resolve claims that it charged black customers more for coverage than white ones, regulators in Florida and Georgia said they suspected some companies were continuing to discriminate.</p>
        <p>The regulators said they thought that at least four companies were continuing to discriminate in premium collections in Georgia and at least one was doing so in Florida. But they said their investgations were in the preliminary stages and that the number might well grow as they gathered more information.</p>
        <p>Both Bill Nelson, the insurance commissioner in Florida, and John W. Oxendine, the commissioner in Georgia, issued orders yesterday that the practice be stopped immediately. The orders apply to 28 companies in Florida and 23 in Georgia. Ignoring the order, the regulators said, could lead to fines and revocation of sales licenses.</p>
        <p>Neither state would identify companies suspected of discrimination. But they said that while they developed their cases, they wanted to pre-empt further discrimination.</p>
        <p>''We don't want to let another day go by with consumers paying higher premiums because of the color of their skin,'' Mr. Nelson said.</p>
        <p>On June 21, American General, the nation's fourth-largest life insurer, agreed to pay $215.5 million in fines and restitution to settle a class-action suit and accusations by regulators that for decades it had charged black customers up to 30 percent more than it charged white ones for burial insurance. American General acknowledged that it had continued to collect the discriminatory premiums until April, when Mr. Nelson ordered the company to stop.</p>
        <p>Just last week, the two largest American life insurers -- MetLife and Prudential Insurance of America -- were accused in separate class-action suits of charging blacks more than whites for coverage. Both companies acknowledged they had priced life insurance based at least in part on race but said they stopped collecting premiums on all burial policies, known as industrial life, in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>For decades, until the civil rights actions of the early 1960's, the insurance industry sold life insurance based on actuarial tables indicating that blacks were likely to die sooner than whites. Later, the actuaries came to believe that longevity was related to economic conditions rather than race.</p>
        <p>Anticipating paying death benefits to blacks sooner than to whites, the insurers charged blacks higher premiums. In many cases, the companies also often charged both blacks and whites more in premiums than the policies would eventually pay their heirs.</p>
        <p>Florida began investigating the discrimination last fall. In Atlanta, Mr. Oxendine said his office had begun looking into companies in Georgia just last month. ''We definitely see indications that some of these policies are still in force and that the race-based premiums are still being collected,'' he said. ''We've just started. We haven't looked at most of the companies yet.''</p>
