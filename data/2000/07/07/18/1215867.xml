        <p>Gov George W Bush appears to be giving true consideration to selecting a vice presidential running mate who supports abortion rights; his overtures to politicians who favor abortion rights, such as Governors Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and George E Pataki of New York, have decidedly scrambled Vice Presidential field; can afford luxury of choice since conservative stalwarts seem most intent on winning back White House, but advisers are fearful that liberal stance may infuriate Roman Catholic Church and Christian Right and is not worth risk (M)</p>

        <p>When Gov. George W. Bush is asked what he is looking for in a running mate, he talks about things like preparedness to be president and compatibility. But he never mentions one factor that several advisers say is hovering over the entire  process: abortion.</p>
        <p>This is the first presidential campaign in which the Republican candidate truly appears to be weighing whether to pick a No. 2 who supports abortion rights. Mr. Bush has that luxury because conservative stalwarts do not seem to mind. Many, like Pat Robertson, are so eager to win back the White House that they are willing to go along (albeit grudgingly) with just about anyone.</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Bush's overtures to politicians who favor abortion rights, namely Governors Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and George E. Pataki of New York, has decidedly scrambled the selection of a running mate.</p>
        <p>Several advisers to Mr. Bush said, for example, that Mr. Ridge would be at the top of the list were it not for his stand on abortion. Mr. Ridge is from an important state, has an impressive biography and, perhaps most importantly, gets along quite well with Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>But one after another, Bush advisers expressed skepticism that the Pennsylvania governor would be picked. Mr. Bush is expected to make a decision in the next week or so. Of course, the only way to know is to get into Mr. Bush's head. That did not deter some advisers from predicting that he would settle for someone who is safely anti-abortion, like Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska or Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee.</p>
        <p>''I'd love to see it,'' said a Bush adviser who thinks Mr. Ridge would make an ideal running mate but is not worth the risk. ''But why would you throw a monkey wrench into the gears of your base?''</p>
        <p>He and other Bush loyalists said they were especially worried that choosing Mr. Ridge would infuriate the Catholic church, which they consider as much of a concern as the Christian Right.</p>
        <p>Indeed, a CBS News Poll released today found that about a third of Mr. Bush's supporters said they would be less likely to vote for him if he picked a running mate who supported abortion. They would not vote at all -- or defect to Patrick J. Buchanan, the abortion opponent who is seeking the nomination of the Reform Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ridge, in an interview, questioned Mr. Buchanan's potency. ''I don't think he's going to be factor,'' he said, ''And he's not about to push Governor Bush.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said in an interview that an abortion rights position should be ''no disqualifier'' for his brother. His choice favors abortion rights: Colin L. Powell. (But Bush aides said General Powell has made his disinterest clear.)</p>
        <p>Former President Gerald Ford weighed in for Mr. Ridge, scoffing at the idea that abortion foes would desert the party. ''Where are they gonna go?'' Mr. Ford asked in an interview published today in The New York Daily News.</p>
        <p>Indeed, a minority of Bush advisers take issue with those who say Mr. Bush is less inclined to take a risk. They argue that because Mr. Bush is entering his convention ahead in the polls, he has more leeway to pick an abortion rights running mate.</p>
        <p>Some go as far as to say that alienating conservatives who oppose abortion -- risky as it would be -- could appear bold and entice not only  Republicans who favor abortion rights but swing voters and Democrats.</p>
        <p>''There are people who would say, 'Good for Bush!' '' said one Bush adviser who is pushing for Mr. Ridge.</p>
        <p>Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University and an authority on abortion politics, said: ''You've got a nominee who is clearly pro-life. You've got a platform that's clearly pro-life. I think a display of independence could go over very well. Offending an important interest group in your party, in its way, can have a positive impact.''</p>
        <p>Yet in the case of Mr. Ridge, several Bush advisers explained that the dangers were far deeper than the conventional wisdom that religious conservatives would squawk and perhaps frustrate efforts at harmony at the party's national convention that opens late this month. They would squawk.</p>
        <p>As Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, an abortion foe, put it: ''To have your No. 2 person not carrying out the dominant position on the most difficult issue of the day would cause some pause.''</p>
        <p>But some advisers to Mr. Bush -- even ones who favor Mr. Ridge -- said the deeper concern was over the reaction from the Catholic church because the Pennsylvania governor is Catholic.</p>
        <p>''They would not be able to hold functions in Catholic settings; Catholic colleges, Catholic high schools, Catholic institutions,'' said a Bush adviser who otherwise said Mr. Ridge would make the best choice. ''Every city that you were to go to, there would be bishops and cardinals who would protest.''</p>
        <p>One Republican operative who recently discussed the selection process with Mr. Bush said, ''I don't think he's afraid of the Christian Right.''</p>
        <p>While Democrats grouse that Mr. Bush has a deeper bench of prospects than Al Gore, the vice president has the advantage of not having any single issue looming over his short list.</p>
        <p>It could be, of course, that while his advisers are wrestling with the possibilities, Mr. Bush really never intended to pick an abortion rights candidate. Some advocates say Mr. Bush consideration of candidates who support abortion rights has been a shell game intended to stroke his friends and placate abortion right supporters.</p>
        <p>Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale said he auditioned some politicians in 1984 that he never intended to pick as his running mate out of nothing more than friendship.</p>
        <p>''They were all friends of mine,'' Mr. Mondale said. ''One of the reasons I wanted to talk to them was I liked them and I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.''</p>
        <p>At first glance, that seemed to be what was happening when Mr. Bush met with Mr. Pataki on Friday. After all, no Bush adviser had dared to predict that the Texas governor could win New York. And Mr. Bush is even friendlier with Mr. Ridge than with Mr. Pataki.</p>
        <p>But people close to Mr. Bush and Mr. Pataki said today that after the two had their meeting that morning, they privately met again over lunch. And some Bush advisers said the Texas governor appeared to be taking a close look at Mr. Pataki because, though he is Catholic, he has not had difficulties with Catholic leaders in the state as has Mr. Ridge.</p>
        <p>Those advisers said the problem for Mr. Ridge is that he has become too closely identified with the abortion issue, as happened with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. Mrs. Whitman has argued that an abortion rights running mate would hardly be a drag on the ticket.</p>
        <p>''I've just talked to too many Republicans across the country who say, 'I don't want this to be the definer,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman and other abortion rights Republicans can take heart that Ronald Reagan picked a running mate in 1980 who -- unlike Mr. Reagan -- had opposed a constitutional prohibition against abortion. George Bush, the running mate, had little choice but to emphasize that he opposed abortion.</p>
        <p>But he squirmed a bit at his joint news conference with Mr. Reagan: ''Please do not try to keep reminding me of differences I had,'' Mr. Bush implored.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the Reagan-Bush ticket, the questions eventually subsided.</p>
