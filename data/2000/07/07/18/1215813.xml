        <p>What a fascinating confluence of events: last Friday, a blue-ribbon commission studying baseball's economics recommended that teams share up to 50 percent of their local revenues, including television fees.</p>
        <p>On the same day, a lawsuit filed against the Yankees by MSG Network revealed that the team has made a deal with the many-tentacled International Management Group to create a cable television network that will pay the team $65 million next year and $119 million by 2010.</p>
        <p>Teams were jealous enough of the Yankees' MSG deal, which expires after this season, when the world champions will receive $55.4 million.</p>
        <p>Think of the envy of teams with puny television deals, which cannot support a $100 million payroll or win three World Series in four seasons.</p>
        <p>Think of the Pirates, with only $7 million in TV cash, or the poor Padres, with a mere $6 million, according to Broadcasting &amp; Cable magazine. The Expos have no TV deal!</p>
        <p>Even a new Pirates or Reds stadium won't level the revenue field much; eventually, the Yankees will get a new ballpark that will generate so much cash that George Steinbrenner's squad may have no solvent teams to compete against.</p>
        <p>Back to the blue-ribbon panel. It hardly seems possible that Steinbrenner endorsed the creation of a network that would generate still more TV cash in order to kick half of it back to revenue-poor clubs.</p>
        <p>Imagine a sitdown between Steinbrenner and Harvey Schiller, the chairman of YankeeNets, the parent company of the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''I feel bad for my Padres pals,'' the Boss says. ''They've lost $72 million since 1995 and I've made $64 million. Dang it, if I prosper, the Pods got to prosper. Got it, Harv?''</p>
        <p>Right now, teams contribute 20 percent of their net local revenues to a major league pool, with only one-quarter of the money redistributed to teams below the industry's average local revenue. The rest goes equally to all clubs.</p>
        <p>The panel suggested pooling 40 percent to 50 percent of all local revenues in a yet unspecified way.</p>
        <p>Don't expect Steinbrenner, the future impresario of the New York Sports Network and sovereign of a new stadium with 150 luxury suites, to gladly hand over half of these wonderful revenues to enhance the cause of major league socialism.</p>
        <p>Who is to say sharing more revenues will help struggling teams? Why give the weak sisters a windfall for being, well, weak sisters?</p>
        <p>Page 1 of the commission's report noted that existing revenue sharing has not helped competitive balance; needy teams did not use the cash to pay players. ''Some low-revenue clubs,'' the report said, ''believing the amount of their proceeds from revenue sharing insufficient to enable them to become competitive, used those proceeds to become modestly profitable.''</p>
        <p>The commission linked more revenue sharing to setting minimum payrolls, discouraging teams from lining their greedy pockets. Good old George Steinbrenner can help. If he pooled half his network cash, the poor teams could sign more players and post higher profits. All thanks to George. Imagine the acclaim that would shower down on our corporate Yankee Doodle Dandy if he personally pushed other teams into the black.</p>
        <p>The Expos, in a market that doesn't sustain a team with a teensy payroll, lost $5.1 million from 1995 to 1999. Just send a few more million over the border, George, just a few more. Help put us over the top.</p>
        <p>Montreal's owner, Jeffrey Loria, might have trimmed his losses if he hadn't jacked up his TV contract demands beyond what any station would sanely pay.</p>
        <p>With the Yankees, there is no such concern. MSG would likely pay semi-insanely to keep the Yankees, the bulwark of the network. What would MSG carry in the spring and summer without the Yanks? Metro Guide programming?</p>
        <p>Cablevision would probably pay from $75 million to $100 million a year to preserve the Yankees on MSG. But MSG is in a war of retention. In its lawsuit, MSG claims that the new Yankee network is not an offer that it can match, under its right to match any outside offers for Yankee rights.</p>
        <p>The Yankees followed the contract, presenting the network as its offer and challenging Cablevision to do exactly what I.M.G. plans to do.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing to match,'' said Bob Gutkowski, who made the Yankee deal at MSG when Paramount Communications owned it. Paramount outbid Cablevision's Sportschannel New York (now Fox Sports New York) to snare the Yankees. Eventually, Cablevision acquired Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>Gutkowski, now the president of Worldwide Entertainment &amp; Sports, has seen the other side of the Yankee equation. Between 1997 and 1999, as an executive for the Marquee Group and SFX Sports, Gutkowski counseled Steinbrenner on creating a network of his own.</p>
        <p>''The Yankees don't want to sell their rights, so George is creating an equity base and a competitor,'' he said, noting that Cablevision's matching right does not preclude the Yankees from changing their desires from a straight rights deal to a network. ''I think the Yankees will win. And losing the Yankees will be a huge body blow to Cablevision. MSG may have to be folded into Fox Sports New York.''</p>
        <p>In the first phase of the Yankees-MSG battle, Judge Barry A. Cozier issued a preliminary injunction to keep the Yankees from consummating the network deal. Barring a settlement, the two sports fat cats will meet in court on July 31, the day the network deal is set to close. Now, this is great interleague baseball.</p>
