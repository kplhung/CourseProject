        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article ''Working to Block Allergens at the Source of the Attack'' (July 11) regarding anti-IgE allergy largely overlooked a fascinating aspect: the response to placebos in each of the studies.</p>
        <p>In the first, 39 percent of children receiving placebos came off inhaled steroids for their asthma. In the next two studies, 21 percent and 30 percent of adults reported fewer asthma attacks on placebo, a response rate only about 11 percentage points lower than those on the study drugs. One might venture to say that in each case two-thirds of the response could be attributed to the placebo effect, while only one-third was clearly from the medication being investigated.</p>

        <p>While I applaud such research, we cannot ignore the healing powers of the human body and spirit.  We possess within ourselves some of the greatest medical miracles, most of which we are only just beginning to understand. Only when we learn to integrate traditional medical therapies with a holistic approach to healing will we truly reach the pinnacle of our modern medical abilities.</p>
