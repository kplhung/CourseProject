        <p>Shares of Drkoop.com fell again yesterday, down 18 percent after it warned that its second-quarter losses would be more than Wall Street expected and that its chief operating officer and its chief financial officer had resigned. The company said it expected a net loss of $1.15 to $1.18 cents a diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, compared with a net loss of $1.28 in the same quarter last year. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had been expecting the company to post a loss of 30 cents a share. Drkoop.com said revenue would be $2.5 million to $3 million, compared with $1 million last year. Dennis Upah, chief operating officer, and Susan Georgen-Saad, chief financial officer, would leave the company and serve as consultants. Shares of Drkoop.com, which once traded as high as $35, fell 31.25, to $1.28.</p>
