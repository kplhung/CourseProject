        <p>In the debate over taxing goods and services sold over the Internet, a vexing issue has been which jurisdiction's taxes to apply. The place where the product is shipped? Where it is used? Where the bill is sent?</p>
        <p>Opponents of taxing sales over the Internet have said it can be impossible to tell where a customer is in cyberspace and, thus, sales and use taxes cannot be applied.</p>
        <p>But thorny as that issue has been made to appear, Congress last week found a way to solve it for that most portable of devices, the cellular telephone. And there was no dissent.</p>
        <p>By voice vote and with White House support, both houses approved legislation specifying that each cell phone will have a ''primary service area'' for the purpose of state and local taxes. Users pay between $4 billion and $7 billion annually in state and local cell phone user taxes, the industry estimates, and sorting out those taxes has been costly for the companies.</p>
        <p>While a customer simply gets a single line on the bill listing state and local taxes, the cell phone provider must track calls made as that customer's phone is used in different cities and states so that taxes can be paid to each jurisdiction, said Chris Putala, a vice president of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, an international group.</p>
        <p>For most cell phones the primary service area will be the address where bills are sent. But in other cases, like phones issued by national corporations to employees in many places, a primary service area will be declared for each phone and will ordinarily be tied to the area code. Thus a New York company issuing cell phones to employees in North Carolina would owe taxes to North Carolina and to whatever city there the company declared as the primary use address.</p>
        <p>Senator Byron Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, who sponsored the Senate version of the bill, said, ''This is one of those cases where it was in everybody's interest to create simplification.''.</p>
        <p>The tax bill was sponsored in the House by Henry Hyde, an antitax Republican from suburban Chicago.</p>
        <p>Lisa Cowell, executive direct of the E-Fairness Coalition, a group of merchants advocating uniform application of sales taxes regardless of whether a sale takes place in a store, by telephone or online, said the bill's passage made it clear that the Internet taxation issue could be resolved.</p>
        <p>''A lot of politicians have stopped hiding behind this bogyman of 'it can't be done' because no one knows where the customer is,'' she said.</p>
