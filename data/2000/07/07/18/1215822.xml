        <p>Book on Sing Sing Is Contraband</p>

        <p>Book on Sing Sing Is Contraband</p>
        <p>''Newjack,'' TED CONOVER'S book about the year he spent working as a corrections officer in Sing Sing, is considered prison contraband in New York State. Inmates are forbidden to have it in their cells, and it is not available in prison libraries because state corrections officials have not given the book an official thumbs up or thumbs down (although Mr. Conover says prisoners have been passing a bootleg copy around Sing Sing).</p>
        <p>Inmates have been asking for the book since it was published in May. In an interview on June 28, JAMES B. FLATEAU, a spokesman for the Department of Correctional Services, said the state would make a decision within two weeks.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Flateau said officials at Sing Sing made a recommendation last week and the department would decide this week. He would not say what the recommendation was.</p>
        <p>Although ''Newjack'' contains criticism of prisons, its portrayal of the guards is largely sympathetic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conover said he was worried that the corrections department would keep ''Newjack'' under review indefinitely, in effect banning it. ''I can't imagine any real security concern,'' Mr. Conover said yesterday. ''This is not a book about bomb building or revolution. Prison is a small world. There is little in 'Newjack' that inmates don't already know.''</p>
        <p>In the Hamptons, Celebrity Car Talk</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, GEORGE PLIMPTON arranged to play the triangle with the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein, and write an article about doing so. ''I destroyed Mahler's Fourth,'' he says now. Backstage at Avery Fisher Hall, he met ROBERT JOHNSON, then the orchestra's principal horn player.</p>
        <p>Before long, Mr. Johnson had left the Philharmonic to start a chamber music group with a three-word name. The first two words were the same as the first two words in the Philharmonic's name, and the third word began with the same four letters -- New York Philomusica. ''He asked me if I would be identified with it,'' Mr. Plimpton recalled, adding, ''not as a musician.'' And so he became the president of Philomusica's board.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to Sunday night, when the New York Philomusica played at Grey Gardens, the former home of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's aunt in East Hampton, N.Y., that is leased to FRANCES HAYWARD, another Philomusica board member.</p>
        <p>Somehow, several conversations before the concert had to do with cars. Mr. Plimpton was talking about a fender-bender he had had in the car he had rented to drive to Long Island. No injuries, he said, and strictly speaking it was not a fender-bender It was the hood of the car that had been bent.</p>
        <p>PETER JENNINGS was talking about his wife's new Volkswagen Beetle (automatic transmission, not stick shift) and his son's truck (stick shift, not automatic transmission), and a hard-driving father's worst fear: downshifting to second gear when an even bigger truck is in the rear-view mirror.</p>
        <p>Beer Baron Blends</p>
        <p>The other day, JIM KOCH, chief executive of the Boston Beer Company, which makes Samuel Adams beer, was passing by the Sam Adams Brewhouse, a bar in the Los Angeles International Airport that sells, guess what?</p>
        <p>''I stopped in before my flight, just to see how it was going, and introduced myself,'' he said. ''They had a couple of pictures of me on the wall and some quotes from my great-great-grandfather.'' But he said the manager, two bartenders and the waitresses -- who work for a concessionaire -- did not believe that Mr. Koch (pronounced Cook) was who he said he was.</p>
        <p>''They were like, 'Is that your voice in the commercials?' I said, 'Yes.' I tried to explain. If we were willing to pay for real talent, we could get somebody with a good voice.'' He also said it was his signature on the bottles. He pulled out his driver's license to prove it. All this took a couple of hours. Mr. Koch missed his flight to San Francisco. ''Everybody up there was frantic. I explained: I stopped in a bar.''</p>
