        <p>The Georgia-Pacific Group said yesterday that it would buy the Fort James Corporation for $7.5 billion in cash and stock, creating the world's largest maker of tissue.</p>
        <p>Based on closing prices on Friday, the deal calls for Georgia-Pacific to pay $37.17 for each share of Fort James, 80 percent in cash and 20 percent in stock. It will also assume $3.5 billion in debt. The combined company will have about $25 billion in sales.</p>

        <p>The Georgia-Pacific Group said yesterday that it would buy the Fort James Corporation for $7.5 billion in cash and stock, creating the world's largest maker of tissue.</p>
        <p>Based on closing prices on Friday, the deal calls for Georgia-Pacific to pay $37.17 for each share of Fort James, 80 percent in cash and 20 percent in stock. It will also assume $3.5 billion in debt. The combined company will have about $25 billion in sales.</p>
        <p>Georgia-Pacific will divest 250,000 tons of tissue capacity to ward off potential Justice Department objections. And it will divest some commodity operations to raise cash.</p>
        <p>The acquisition surprised many analysts. Georgia-Pacific has been steadily adding to its portfolio of retail and away-from-home papers -- tissues, napkins and other products used in businesses and restaurants -- and owns AngelSoft, Coronet and other well-known brands. Still, it derived more than 90 percent of its $17.8 billion in revenue last year from lumber, paperboard and other highly cyclical commodity papers.</p>
        <p>Thus, most analysts saw the company as more similar to commodity paper companies like International Paper and Weyerhaueser than to tissue producers like Procter &amp; Gamble and Kimberly-Clark.</p>
        <p>''I figured G.P. would acquire other commodity paper companies, or maybe be bought itself,'' said Mark Wilde, an analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.</p>
        <p>In many ways, though, Georgia-Pacific has been telegraphing its search for ways to unleash itself from the cyclical pulp and paper market for some time. In late 1997, it created a tracking stock for its timber operations. And over the last two years, it bought the Chesapeake Corporation's tissue operations and Unisource Worldwide, a distributor of office papers, washroom supplies and janitorial services. Earlier this month, it bought exclusive rights to distribute the Xerox Corporation's printer and copier papers.</p>
        <p>''We've been moving away from a commodity, raw material-based strategy, and you can expect us to continue that,'' said A. D. Correll, Georgia-Pacific's chairman and chief executive. The company's second-quarter earnings, which it also released yesterday, puts Mr. Correll's yen for higher-margin products into focus. The company's pulp and paper business had a strong quarter, but weak demand and prices for its building-products segment pulled profit down to $206 million, some $5 million less than in the quarter a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Per-share earnings of $1.20 beat analysts' forecasts of $1.16, but Charles L. Hill, director of research at First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings, said most analysts had cut their estimates in anticipation of a bad quarter.</p>
        <p>Fort James, which owns well-known brands like Quilted Northern, Brawny and Dixie Cups, does own some pulp plants, but it uses much of its production for its tissues. If the merger goes through, Georgia-Pacific will command about a third of the North American market for retail and away-from-home paper.</p>
        <p>Apparently, the prospect does not thrill investors. Shares of Georgia-Pacific fell $2.25, to $26.375. Fort James soared $8.4375, to $33.  ''They'll have to really show that this merger will work before the Street will buy into it,'' said Mr. Wilde of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.</p>
        <p>Fort James will not be easy for Georgia-Pacific to digest. Fort James was formed in 1997 when James River and Fort Howard merged, and it has had a rough time integrating back-office operations and product lines.</p>
        <p>Georgia-Pacific recently installed a highly sophisticated software system that ties in all its operations, from orders to production to accounts receivable to human resources, and analysts expect it to add Fort James's operations to the system as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Georgia-Pacific, which already carries about $6.5 billion in debt, is borrowing $10 billion more to finance the deal. Mr. Carroll has said he wants to get debt down to $9.5 billion by early 2003.</p>
        <p>Mr. Correll said divestitures would accomplish much of that, but he declined to identify what those would be. But Mr. Wilde suggested that lumber operations were ''high on the hit list.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Correll also promised that, by the third year of the merger, he would have wrested at least $500 million in annual costs out of the combined companies. He added that he had already pinpointed ''a fair number of job reductions'' and would soon deliver the news to employees.</p>
        <p>Fort James's top management seemed to be on that list. Miles Marsh, Fort James's chief executive, was not included in yesterday's conference call with analysts.</p>
