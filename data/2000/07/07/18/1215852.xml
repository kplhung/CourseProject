        <p>The Frommer's guide to France may be made up of chapters and maps, but most readers know it as an indivisible and coherent whole: a book.</p>
        <p>This fall, that book and a few hundred others will take a new form on the Internet. They will be sold in component parts -- chapters, maps and even paragraphs -- that can be mixed and matched. Readers will be invited to create customized books by picking pieces of content a la carte from an array of already-published guides at, say, $5 a chapter instead of $20 a book. Buyers will have the option of receiving their books electronically or ordering them printed, bound and delivered to their door.</p>
        <p>The customization is possible because of a deal announced last month between an online service called iUniverse and IDG Books, the publisher of the Dummies guidebooks, Frommer's travel guides and Cliffs Notes. With IDG's permission, iUniverse is creating a digital system that enables pieces of every guidebook to be assembled on the fly.</p>
        <p>The partnership is one of the first steps toward a new editorial marketplace that some publishers and technology companies have been envisioning since the dawn of digital media. And it is the latest challenge to the traditional definition of a book. Under this model, books have not only turned into streams of electronic bits that are downloaded to hand-held devices or printed on demand. They have also turned into databases -- pools of digital information that people can extract and combine on their own terms.</p>
        <p>''Imagine that you are going on a trip,'' said Patricia Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers and a former member of Congress. ''You may want a couple chapters of a travel book, a couple chapters of a cookbook,'' adding that readers probably do not want to carry each of those books for just a few chapters.</p>
        <p>Now imagine going into a bookstore and asking to buy only those chapters. ''They are going to look at you,'' she said, ''and say, 'What?' ''</p>
        <p>On the Internet, that request is not so crazy. ''The online world is uniquely suited to providing this kind of highly targeted, highly customized information,'' said David Sidman, director of new publishing technologies for John Wiley &amp; Sons. Four years ago, Mr. Sidman helped to develop tools that enabled scientific journals to be delivered online, article by article. Today, he said, selling content this way ''represents a tremendous new revenue opportunity for publishers of all kinds.''</p>
        <p>Travel books, textbooks, cookbooks and how-to guides will be some of the first books chopped into interchangeable parts, according to officials at publishing and software companies experimenting with the concept. In fact, some publishers are already offering bits and pieces of content for downloading to hand-held devices like Palm organizers. And although no one is talking about chopping up narrative books, like novels, anthologies of short stories could be distributed this way.</p>
        <p>''We're so close we can just smell it,'' Ms. Schroeder said. ''This is all going to be very doable, very soon.''</p>
        <p>But before pages and chapters will be available for the picking, several issues need to be addressed. For example, turning books into what the industry calls ''disaggregated content'' could destabilize the economics of publishing, something that most established publishers are loath to do. What happens, they ask, if people stop buying whole books in favor of a few popular chapters?</p>
        <p>John Kilcullen, chief executive of IDG Books, does not think that will happen. Although he has not yet set prices for the material that will be available this fall, he said some chapters might be given away as promotional materials and other prices might be set proportionally, so that a 25-page chapter of a 100-page book would cost about 25 percent of the book's list price. Other sections, he added, could cost almost as much as the book itself, particularly if they are in high demand.</p>
        <p>Even so, authors might not be thrilled about having their work sold in pieces or packaged with the work of others. Many recent contracts include broad provisions for electronic rights, publishers say, but few mention the possibility of selling pieces for mixing and matching. Some agents and publishers are already gearing up for new negotiations over modular content.</p>
        <p>William Gladstone, the founder of Waterside Productions, an agency representing many authors in the series of Dummies books, is encouraging writers to sign contracts that permit publishers to sell content in pieces. He is betting that writers will earn more royalties that way. ''I would advise them to be cooperative,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another hurdle involves technical barriers. If a book is going to be chopped into digital pieces for mixing and matching, those pieces need to be technologically compatible with parts of other books. And to make those pieces searchable across databases, companies will have to establish a standard means to identify the piecemeal content, just as the International Standard Book Number, or ISBN, enables books to be catalogued, tracked and bought quickly.</p>
        <p>Until standards are set, publishers are faced with ''a rat's nest'' of problems, said James Lichtenberg, president of Lightspeed, a consulting company for the educational publishing industry. ''You have to have very clear definitions,'' Mr. Lichtenberg said, ''things like 'this means a photograph,' 'this means a map.' ''</p>
        <p>Most of the progress so far has come from the realm of education and research. College professors, after all, have been mixing chunks of editorial content for decades by assigning ''course packs'' that are typically compilations of photocopied pages from magazines, anthologies and nonfiction books.</p>
        <p>Now, with advances in copyright-protection software and the recent drive to create electronic books, many publishers have embraced the idea of selling individual chapters from multiple academic books.</p>
        <p>McGraw-Hill was one of the first to do so; it created a database called Primis that enables professors to choose from 180,000 pages of material spanning 20 disciplines. For example, a professor can build a book that includes ''Notes of a Native Son'' by James Baldwin and see that the selection adds $1.75 to the cost of the book. Other building blocks cost more, like 83 pages of ''The Turn of the Screw,'' by Henry James, priced at $8.55.</p>
        <p>Prices are usually dependent on the popularity of the items and how much McGraw-Hill may have to pay for reprint permissions, said Ginny Moffat, vice president for marketing and custom publishing at McGraw-Hill Higher Education. Features like color pages bump up the costs, too.</p>
        <p>Another large textbook company, Taylor &amp; Francis, will soon be offering a database for building books. It announced last week that it had signed a deal with Versaware, a publishing-technology company that has developed its own customization system. The books could be delivered to students over the Internet as files for printing or downloading to hand-held  devices, said Harry Fox, Versa ware's chief executive. Or they could be printed and bound nearby, then shipped to the college bookstore.</p>
        <p>Manish Chopra, a graduate student at the University of Michigan, is one reader who says he would appreciate the chance to buy books in pieces, rather than whole. He recently visited a Borders bookstore to find ''Consulting Demons,'' a book on corporate consulting by Lewis Pinault. A friend had recommended that he read the early chapters, which dealt with recruiting tactics.</p>
        <p>''This book was like $30 hard cover,'' Mr. Chopra said, ''and I was like, I don't know if I want to buy it, because I was only interested in the first four chapters.'' Instead, he stayed in the bookstore, spent several hours reading the chapters, and put the book back on the shelf.</p>
        <p>If he had been given the chance to buy those chapters for a few dollars, he said, he would have done so. ''It's always the case that you don't need all the information,'' Mr. Chopra said. But if you could buy it in pieces, he said, ''that would be a great tool.''</p>
