        <p>As the Senate moved toward passage of an election-year tax cut for married couples, the Clinton administration renewed its attack today on the tax agenda being promoted by the Republican majority in Congress, calling it a fiscally reckless attempt to help the wealthy at the expense of working people.</p>
        <p>The treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, said the Republican tax cut proposals ''primarily benefit the highest income Americans'' and would explode in cost as time went by, imperiling the nation's ability to deal with long-term challenges like maintaining the solvency of the Social Security and Medicare systems.</p>

        <p>As the Senate moved toward passage of an election-year tax cut for married couples, the Clinton administration renewed its attack today on the tax agenda being promoted by the Republican majority in Congress, calling it a fiscally reckless attempt to help the wealthy at the expense of working people.</p>
        <p>The treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, said the Republican tax cut proposals ''primarily benefit the highest income Americans'' and would explode in cost as time went by, imperiling the nation's ability to deal with long-term challenges like maintaining the solvency of the Social Security and Medicare systems.</p>
        <p>Republicans defended their plans as prudent and said President Clinton was misguided in casting all tax debates as a contest between rich and poor.</p>
        <p>And they pressed on with their effort to pass their proposed tax cut for couples, heartened by new, larger projections of the federal budget surplus expected from the Congressional Budget Office.</p>
        <p>The budget office, in a report to be released on Tuesday, estimated that the budget surplus outside of Social Security will be nearly $2.2 trillion over the next decade.</p>
        <p>The projection is $1.3 trillion higher than the budget office's last estimate, which came in January, and $300 billion higher than a projection released last month by the White House's Office of Management and Budget.</p>
        <p>The Senate passed a bill last week to repeal the federal estate tax, joining the House, which had passed it last month. The House plans to take up bills this week to expand tax breaks for Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) retirement plans and to repeal some of the tax on Social Security benefits.</p>
        <p>But today, the focus in Congress was on the Republican plan to reduce taxes for nearly all married couples.</p>
        <p>Packaged as an attempt to alleviate the so-called marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that leads many two-income couples to pay more in taxes than they would if they had remained single, the bill debated in the Senate today would actually amount to a tax cut for married couples who do not pay the penalty as well as those that do.</p>
        <p>Democrats said the bill failed to address the underlying complexities in the tax code that create the marriage penalty.</p>
        <p>They offered an alternative proposal that would have given a tax cut only to those couples who actually paid more because they are married and would have limited the benefits to couples with incomes of less than $150,000.</p>
        <p>The Democratic proposal was defeated by a vote of 50 to 46.</p>
        <p>Republicans brushed aside complaints from Democrats that high-income people would benefit from their plan.</p>
        <p>''I do not shy away from the fact that our bill benefits virtually every American family,'' said Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware.</p>
        <p>With projections of the federal budget surplus growing and tax cuts finding more support among Democrats than they did even a few months ago, administration officials stressed that Mr. Clinton would also like to enact tax reductions.</p>
        <p>But they said the president would continue to insist that any cuts primarily benefit low- and middle-income people and that they not be adopted before bipartisan agreement on other issues like the addition of prescription drug coverage to Medicare.</p>
        <p>An analysis released today by the Treasury Department said that the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers by income -- about 1.2 million households earning $346,000 or more -- would receive 27.5 percent of the benefits of the tax cuts being pushed this year by Republicans.</p>
        <p>The top 10 percent of taxpayers by income -- 11.5 million households with incomes of $115,000 or more -- would receive 60.2 percent of the benefits, the analysis said.</p>
