        <p>The union representing 11,000 correction officers in New York City has broken with most of the labor movement and endorsed Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate.</p>
        <p>Norman Seabrook, president of the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association of New York, announced yesterday the decision of his union's board.</p>
        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic candidate, has received far more endorsements from unions, including the New York State Construction and Buildings Trades Council, the United Federation of Teachers, the Civil Service Employees Association and the Communications Workers of America.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seabrook said his union had endorsed Mr. Lazio because he aggressively sought the union's endorsement and because Mr. Lazio was once an assistant district attorney, in Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>''I think that Hillary Clinton is a very nice person,'' Mr. Seabrook said, ''and I think she's a warm person, but I think Rick Lazio brings some things to the table that Hillary does not. His children are in the public school system, and he has a law enforcement background.''</p>
        <p>Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, said, ''Over two dozen labor unions have endorsed Hillary, and it's nice that Rick Lazio finally got one. I think working men and women know who is on their side in this race.''</p>
