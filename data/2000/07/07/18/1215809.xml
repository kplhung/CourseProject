        <p>A Short, Creative Trip</p>
        <p>To look at Hedi Slimane -- the Nouvelle Vague suits, the crest of hair foaming down his angular head like two colliding rogue waves -- is to imagine someone too cool for anyone over 40 to identify with. Yet Mr. Slimane, who yesterday was to begin his new job as the men's wear designer at Christian Dior, turns out to be something of a square. He often talks about character and self-respect, two of the more negotiable virtues in the fashion business, and has an affinity for the cultivated worlds of Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld, whose long careers practically make them geezers.</p>

        <p>A Short, Creative Trip</p>
        <p>To look at Hedi Slimane -- the Nouvelle Vague suits, the crest of hair foaming down his angular head like two colliding rogue waves -- is to imagine someone too cool for anyone over 40 to identify with. Yet Mr. Slimane, who yesterday was to begin his new job as the men's wear designer at Christian Dior, turns out to be something of a square. He often talks about character and self-respect, two of the more negotiable virtues in the fashion business, and has an affinity for the cultivated worlds of Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld, whose long careers practically make them geezers.</p>
        <p>Over breakfast one morning last week in Paris, Mr. Slimane, 32, acknowledged that many fashion insiders were surprised by his decision to go to Dior, which gets a lot of attention from John Galliano's women's clothes but hardly causes a stir in men's wear. Mr. Slimane made his name at Saint Laurent, where his sexually charged men's clothes also found converts among women. Last spring he was being courted by Gucci, which wanted to finance a Slimane label, and by Patrizio Bertelli, the Prada chief executive, who wanted him to design Jil Sander. If one knows Mr. Slimane, and the very French way he thinks, his choice was not surprising. As he said of the move from Saint Laurent to Dior, from one venerable French house to another, ''It's just a walk across the street.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Saint Laurent, one may recall, began his career at Dior. So in a sense, the look and culture that became Saint Laurent, and which Mr. Slimane carefully grafted onto his men's style -- the sleek ''smoking'' pantsuits, the razor-sharp shoulders -- had its roots at Dior. Mr. Slimane pointed out that although Mr. Saint Laurent made men's wear fabrics popular in women's fashion, Dior was using fabrics like glen plaid years before.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Lagerfeld at Chanel, Mr. Slimane may be more at home working with established references than inventing his own. So he wouldn't have been automatically tempted by Gucci's offer to bankroll him. There were also issues of creative control, which surfaced soon after Gucci acquired Saint Laurent and Tom Ford assumed the title of creative director for both houses. As hot as Mr. Slimane was at Saint Laurent, Gucci made it clear that it wanted total control over its acquisition.</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Slimane said, ''the No. 1 point for me was not the control; it was the culture.'' And Gucci, by contrast, has a very quick, mobile culture -- one could almost call it a cellular phone culture -- with decisions made by executives who may be in London, Paris or Milan. That is not Mr. Slimane's style.</p>
        <p>Of course, it should be said that Mr. Slimane will bring fresh buzz to Dior, and that is something that Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which owns the house, understands well.</p>
        <p>The Candid Camera</p>
        <p>''I'm a man. I have a penis.''</p>
        <p>This is indisputably the case, but what a funny conversation to be having with Tom Ford on a cell phone in a French taxi while parked outside Balenciaga. Can you imagine holding such a conversation with Balenciaga, who was so skittish and private, so below the common radar, that he probably wouldn't even have acknowledged that he was a man -- much less that he had, uh, one.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ford is a modern man and he was simply responding in his offhand way to questions about Gucci's fall campaign, featuring, among other images, a woman down on all fours as she seems to advance toward a stud in tight trousers. That isn't what catches your eye. It's the unmistakable outline inside his pants.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't meant to be the focal point of the ad,'' Mr. Ford, Gucci's creative director, said. ''It really was not.''</p>
        <p>Yet it's there and one can't think of other examples of mainstream fashion advertising (the ad, part of a series photographed by Alexei Hay, will first appear in August fashion magazines) that have been so candid about male genitals. Even Calvin Klein hasn't been this frank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford began by saying he dislikes the ''puritanical side of American advertising,'' which prefers to have things like nipples smoothed out. He said the image wasn't calculated to shock. ''Of course, when I saw the finished pictures, I noticed the guy's penis,'' he said. ''But what I really noticed was the way the two models were standing. It was like he was towering above you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford suggested that it was coincidence that he recently appeared in a vodka ad with an image of a bottle resting on his lap. ''It's not my obsession at all,'' he said with a light laugh. He added that if women could be sex objects, so could men.</p>
