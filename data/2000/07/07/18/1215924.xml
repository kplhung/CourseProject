        <p>It has happened quickly for the Mets, and at a critical time. With losses in 9 of their last 13 games, the Mets trail the Atlanta Braves by five games in the National League East after last night's game.</p>
        <p>Although the losses have been close, there are problems. ''We could have won all the games,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said.</p>
        <p>With only two weeks to go before the trading deadline, the Mets have been silent. General Manager Steve Phillips has added only one player through a trade during the season: the infielder Lenny Harris.</p>
        <p>Three everyday players are out. Third baseman Robin Ventura and outfielder Darryl Hamilton are on the disabled list, with no certainty on when they will be back, and shortstop Rey Ordonez has been lost for the season with a broken arm. The team would seem to need reinforcements.</p>
        <p>''With our full team, we would have enough,'' said Jim Duquette, the Mets' assistant general manager. ''But if Steve feels we can improve somewhere, we'll do it, primarily if we can do it in the bullpen -- that's where a guy you acquire can have the most effect on your club.''</p>
        <p>If the Mets add a reliever, it would alleviate the burden on Turk Wendell, who is on pace to break the team record he set last year for games pitched. Wendell said he has no problem with the current arrangement, but he has noticed that other contenders like the Yankees and Atlanta Braves have recently added top players through trades.</p>
        <p>''When you see that, you just say, 'Those guys want to do whatever it takes to win now,' '' Wendell said. ''I just look at that and I say, 'I wish we would maybe do more than say more.' I'm not the G.M. and I'm not the one making those decisions, but that's the way I see it. If you want to win now, you do whatever it takes.''</p>
        <p>Second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo said he was not concerned about what moves Phillips might make. But Alfonzo acknowledged that such moves usually lift a team.</p>
        <p>''When they bring in good players, they want to win,'' Alfonzo said. ''It forces yourself to play a little more hard, because you know they want the team to win and have a good team all the way around. That's good -- they know the team has a good chance to go to the playoffs or the World Series.</p>
        <p>''We've got a good team and we can deal with anything right now. But every team has different soft spots. It's tough to find a team that's perfect in each area.''</p>
        <p>While the Mets need bullpen help, they are also exploring trades for starting pitching and a shortstop. The Mets have had discussions with the Phillies about the ace right-hander Curt Schilling, and they scouted Cincinnati Reds shortstop Barry Larkin over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Trading for either player might require the Mets to trade most or all of their best prospects, making another move difficult. Then again, Schilling and Larkin are both proven commodities who would boost a team built to win now.</p>
        <p>Acquiring either will not be easy because both players have veto power over trades. Larkin has 10 years in the majors, all with the Reds, and Schilling has a clause in his contract.</p>
        <p>Schilling has told the Phillies he would waive the clause to be traded to six teams: either New York club, plus Atlanta, Arizona, Cleveland or St. Louis. But the Phillies do not have to accommodate him.</p>
        <p>''Our position on Curt is I want to keep him,'' Phillies General Manager Ed Wade said today. ''He has indicated to us a list of places he is interested in going to -- unencumbered -- and I've talked to all those clubs and I've told them my intention is to keep him. If we were overwhelmed, we'd have to consider it. Otherwise, nothing has changed.''</p>
        <p>Schilling will earn $6.5 million next season in the final year of his contract, but if he is traded now, he has a right to demand another trade over the winter. Although Wade indicated the Phillies can move Schilling to any of his listed teams without the pitcher needing a contract extension, Schilling's agent, Jeff Borris, seemed to disagree. If a deal were completed, Borris said, ''I believe we would have to get involved at that point.'' Would a contract extension be a requirement to Schilling's accepting a deal? ''I think they would go hand in hand,'' Borris said.</p>
        <p>Larkin, who is the Reds' captain and has played with the team since 1986, has stated that his preference is to re-sign with Cincinnati. He may also want a contract extension to approve a trade. ''I'm not a hired gun,'' he told The Cincinnati Enquirer last weekend. ''I'm not a pitcher or a hitter, a guy that can get you over the top. My greatest impact is over the long haul.''</p>
