        <p>The resurgent summer movie season received another near-miraculous boost from the opening of ''X-Men,'' based on the venerable comic book series about young mutants battling prejudice and evil. The film, directed by Bryan Singer and starring Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, earned an estimated $57.5 million in the nation's theaters over the weekend, which is not only about $15 million more than even the rosiest forecast but also amounts to the largest July opening in movie history. Coming just a week after the similarly astonishing $42.5 million opening of ''Scary Movie,'' and two weeks after ''The Perfect Storm'' opened to $41.5 million, the box-office haul indicates that people, especially young people, are once again able, willing and very eager to go to the movies, if they are given what they want.</p>

        <p>The resurgent summer movie season received another near-miraculous boost from the opening of ''X-Men,'' based on the venerable comic book series about young mutants battling prejudice and evil. The film, directed by Bryan Singer and starring Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, earned an estimated $57.5 million in the nation's theaters over the weekend, which is not only about $15 million more than even the rosiest forecast but also amounts to the largest July opening in movie history. Coming just a week after the similarly astonishing $42.5 million opening of ''Scary Movie,'' and two weeks after ''The Perfect Storm'' opened to $41.5 million, the box-office haul indicates that people, especially young people, are once again able, willing and very eager to go to the movies, if they are given what they want.</p>
        <p>Different Role</p>
        <p>Philip Seymour Hoffman, who was nominated for a Tony Award this year for his performance in ''True West'' and was acclaimed for his acting in ''The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' has donned his director's hat to shepherd Stephen Adly Guirgis's ''Jesus Hopped the A Train'' to the stage. The Labyrinth Theater Company Production of the two-act drama about two Rikers Island convicts opens at 8 tonight at Center Stage/NY, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea.</p>
        <p>Doubleheader</p>
        <p>In the previous chapter of this saga, the rains came. And so, after two and a half hours on the night of June 28, at the start of the second scene of Act III of the New York Grand Opera production of ''Un Ballo in Maschera'' by Verdi, the show was unable to go on, and the audience fled. Ordinarily, an outdoor performance is considered completed once it passes the first intermission, as this did. But Vincent La Selva, director of the company, felt he had a responsibility to render the opera complete. So tomorrow night at 6, the final two scenes of ''Ballo'' will be heard at the Central Park Summerstage, preceding the full (he hopes) presentation of Verdi's 24th opera, ''La Forza del Destino,'' beginning at 6:30.</p>
        <p>Cool Evening</p>
        <p>Jazz in its infinite variety is on the menu at the 92nd Street Y, where the 16th season of ''Jazz in July'' begins at 8 tonight. Under the artistic direction of Dick Hyman, the six-program series, through July 27, opens with ''Cool School,'' spotlighting the pianist Marian McPartland in a recollection of artists like Stan Getz and Lee Konitz in the 1950's and 1960's. In other highlights, New Orleans takes center stage next Tuesday and blues on July 26.</p>
