        <p>Not content with orchestrating a merger with the London Stock Exchange, the chairman of the Frankfurt stock exchange said today that he wanted to explore a full merger with the Nasdaq market in the United States.</p>
        <p>In a statement about their own plans to merge, the London Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt exchange, or the Deutsche Borse, said their real goal was to explore a complete partnership with Nasdaq, which is run by the National Association of Securities Dealers.</p>
        <p>The two exchanges reiterated earlier statements that they wanted to set up cross-shareholdings with Nasdaq as part of an effort to set up a global trading system. But the statement today went further.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Nasdaq said it was in discussions with the Frankfurt and London exchanges about their relationship but it was ''premature to discuss anything in further detail.''</p>
        <p>Werner Seifert, chief executive of Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt and the man who is slated to run the combined London-Frankfurt operation, said today that global connections were increasingly critical to success.</p>
        <p>''As a final objective, a European goal is not far reaching enough and that's why we are talking with Nasdaq,'' Mr. Seifert said at a news conference here.</p>
        <p>Officials at Deutsche Borse said they had viewed a full merger with Nasdaq as an appealing possibility for months.</p>
        <p>But industry executives predict it will be a long while before Mr. Seifert pulls off such a trans-Atlantic merger. For one thing, there is still resistance in London and Frankfurt to the proposed merger of the two European exchanges, which is to be called iX.</p>
        <p>Frankfurt brokers are already worried that Nasdaq's European operations, linked to iX, will be based in London and will take business from Frankfurt.</p>
