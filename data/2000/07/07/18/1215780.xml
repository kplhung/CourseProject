        <p>Dance works best out of doors when it has a keen focus and blends with its surroundings. That was the message on Wednesday night of ''Dances for Wave Hill,'' now in its 10th year in the lush gardens of this city-owned environmental center in Riverdale, the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Guta Hedewig chose a small hilltop backed by towering fir trees for her ''Descend/Ascend,'' set to music by Pergolesi and Albinoni. One's first view of Ms. Hedewig and Lisa Townsend was of two orange-red spots of color emerging gradually from a screen of branches. The duet was engagingly childlike, but the women remained objects to some extent, their limbs and torsos often hinging into calisthenic brackets.</p>

        <p>Dance works best out of doors when it has a keen focus and blends with its surroundings. That was the message on Wednesday night of ''Dances for Wave Hill,'' now in its 10th year in the lush gardens of this city-owned environmental center in Riverdale, the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Guta Hedewig chose a small hilltop backed by towering fir trees for her ''Descend/Ascend,'' set to music by Pergolesi and Albinoni. One's first view of Ms. Hedewig and Lisa Townsend was of two orange-red spots of color emerging gradually from a screen of branches. The duet was engagingly childlike, but the women remained objects to some extent, their limbs and torsos often hinging into calisthenic brackets.</p>
        <p>What gave them life was the symbiotic relationship of music and choreography and the ways each of the dancers seemed to draw the other continuously into action. At the heart of the duet was a slow, intermittent progression down and up the side of the hill. Throughout, the two figures, so small and clear, bore into the landscape with the sharpness of summer insects. Lynn Marie Ruse designed their vivid dance clothes.</p>
        <p>Nai-Ni Chen juxtaposed wild runs, clusters of bodies and stillness in ''The Unfolding Stone,'' a group dance set to live Korean Chang-Go drumming that essentially recreated nature. Karen Young's costumes looked steeped in a deep purple dye that matched the huge spreading old copper beech at the edge of the clearing. Standing like totems and curled on the ground, the dancers might have been trees or stones.</p>
        <p>Glaring sun made it hard to watch ''Garden Variety Gamelan,'' presented by Terry Dame and the Junkyard Gamelan on a rise over the Hudson River. Seen from the side, the stilt dancing of Jennifer Miller and Jenny Romaine looked amorphous and seemed to have little to do with the music.</p>
        <p>This first of two programs will be repeated tomorrow.</p>
