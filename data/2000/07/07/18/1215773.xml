        <p>You loved the play. Now see the cartoon!</p>
        <p>Thus might an honest advertising writer, driven to desperation, describe the newly recast revival of Sam Shepard's ''True West'' at the Circle in the Square Theater.</p>
        <p>Two very brave actors, Josh Brolin and Elias Koteas, have taken over from the production's original stars, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly, with results that can most kindly be described as flattening. What was once a playwright's dream made flesh, a production in which theatrical exaggeration seemed truer than life itself, is now a simple comic strip.</p>
        <p>When Matthew Warchus's staging of this 1980 study in fraternal friction opened in March, it was hard to imagine anyone improving on it. Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Reilly, largely known for their work in film, delivered a priceless lesson in symbiotic stagecraft, alternating in the leading roles of diametrically different brothers who by degrees turn into each other.</p>
        <p>No matter which actor was Austin, the straight-arrow screenwriter, and which was Lee, the slovenly renegade, you never doubted the familial attraction and repulsion that kept them locked in a psychological (and sometimes literal) stranglehold. Something was definitely going on beneath the skins of these overgrown boys -- who, by the way, didn't look close to identical -- that made the evening's conclusion deliciously inevitable.</p>
        <p>Your heart aches for Mr. Brolin and Mr. Koteas, actors of the same generation and cinematic background as their predecessors, who have been placed in the painful position of tampering with near perfection. For the time being Mr. Brolin is Austin, and Mr. Koteas is Lee, with the reversal of parts scheduled for July 26, and they are as unmixable as oil and water.</p>
        <p>Both Lee's grotesqueness and Austin's blandness have been scaled up. Mr. Koteas evokes one of the homicidal yokels from the horror movie ''The Hills Have Eyes,'' while Mr. Brolin brings to mind John Davidson, the eternally clean-cut singer. The actors seem stuck on these heightened surfaces, composites of traits applied from the outside rather than arrived at from within.</p>
        <p>That the staging remains essentially the same generates an impression of neophyte dancers following a chart of ballroom steps before they have found their own rhythms. When Mr. Brolin anxiously hitches up his pants or compulsively dries a dish, it is with the conscientious air of someone who has remembered to do so. He can get away with this self-consciousness only in the inhibited Austin's early scenes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koteas takes a more flamboyant approach. Wearing a short raincoat of the type favored by flashers, this Lee sits and walks with his legs wide apart. His gestures are correspondingly large and loopy, and he often tucks his lips over his teeth, perhaps to conjure the image of the brothers' toothless father. The actor courts the audience energetically, like a hillbilly clown.</p>
        <p>The supporting performances are commensurately larger, too, with the unctuous movie producer Saul Kimmer (Philip LeStrange, replacing Robert Lupone) as bizarrely silky as Liberace. Celia Weston, the one original member of the cast, has broadened the reactions of the brothers' mother without destroying the character's essential spirit of bewilderment. She is now easily the best thing in the show.</p>
        <p>It is never a good sign when you can separate actors from their gestures, unless the playwright is named Bertolt Brecht. Mr. Brolin and Mr. Koteas convey the comic sense of Mr. Shepard's play but none of its troubling emotional sensibility. And without the fear beneath the laughter, ''True West'' just isn't very funny.</p>
