        <p>President Abdurrahman Wahid said today that he might seek international assistance to halt 18 months of sectarian violence in the eastern Maluku Islands, where rogue army units have taken sides in the growing clashes.</p>
        <p>In a statement that brought to mind the East Timor crisis last year, Mr. Wahid said he might have to call for international help if a three-week-old state of civil emergency fails to stem the violence.</p>
        <p>''I have ordered the governor to work as hard as he can to control the situation,'' he told a meeting of regional administrators here. ''If the outcome is still not satisfactory after we have done our best, we may ask for international help in the form of equipment and logistics.''</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab went further, telling reporters later that the government was pondering whether to allow international peacekeepers into the Malukus. ''The international aid is limited to humanitarian aid, but if it comes to the level that we are not ready to handle, we may have to consider it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Only 11 days ago, Mr. Shihab had flatly ruled out foreign intervention in the conflict, in which more than 2,500 people have been killed.</p>
        <p>But there is now a widespread perception that Mr. Wahid has lost control of the crisis as well as of his armed forces. Television footage today showed soldiers fighting side by side with Muslim militants in attacks on Christian neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>The footage, shot over the weekend by an Associated Press cameraman in the Maluku capital, Ambon, confirmed claims by Christian leaders that army units were supporting the Muslims.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid had ordered commanders to remove units deemed too emotionally involved in the conflict after accusations that the police and the army were taking sides based on their religious affiliation.</p>
        <p>About 90 percent of Indonesia is Muslim, but Malukus residents are about equally split between Muslims  and Christians. The region, once known as the Dutch Spice Islands, lies 1,300 miles northeast of Jakarta and comprises Maluku and North Maluku provinces.</p>
        <p>In September, the government also lost control of the armed forces when pro-Jakarta militias and rogue military units began a killing and arson spree in East Timor after the territory voted for independence.</p>
        <p>Indonesia eventually bowed to international pressure and allowed an Australian-led peacekeeping force into East Timor, which was a humiliation for both the government and the armed forces.</p>
