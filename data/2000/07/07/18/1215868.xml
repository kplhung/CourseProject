        <p>The White House said today that it would propose legislation to set legal requirements for surveillance in cyberspace by law enforcement authorities similar in some ways to those for telephone wiretaps.</p>
        <p>Privacy advocates and civil liberties groups welcomed some aspects of the proposal but said they remained alarmed about a new F.B.I. computer system that searches and intercepts private e-mail and can easily capture communications of people not suspected of crimes.</p>
        <p>The legislative proposal was made as the administration also announced today that it had eased export controls on encryption technology, making it significantly easier for American companies to sell software products to the European Union and eight other trading partners that can be used to keep computer data and communications secure.</p>
        <p>Both the electronic surveillance proposal and the export control changes are part of a broader policy outlined in a speech today by John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff. He said the policy tries to balance the privacy rights of computer users against the needs of law enforcement to be able to monitor digital communications.</p>
        <p>Congress and federal regulators have done little work in the area, even as the world has quickly come to rely heavily on communications through cyberspace. More than 1.4 billion e-mail messages change hands every day.</p>
        <p>The administration's legislative proposal on electronic surveillance tries to fix the inconsistent patchwork of laws that apply different standards to telephone, cable and other technologies with a single standard for those systems and the Internet. Prospects for the proposal in Congress are uncertain.</p>
        <p>Until now, law enforcement agencies have been able to monitor electronic communication with only modest court supervision.</p>
        <p>The proposed legislation would require that the same standards that apply to the interception of the content of telephone calls apply to the interception of e-mail messages. Specifically, it would require law enforcement agents to demonstrate that they have probable cause of a crime to obtain a court order seeking the contents of a suspect's e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>The proposal would also give federal magistrates greater authority to review requests by law enforcement authorities for so-called pen registers -- lists of the phone numbers called from a particular location and the time of the calls. The magistrates now have no authority to question the request for such lists, which are frequently used by the authorities.</p>
        <p>In the context of the Internet, existing laws are ambiguous about what standards apply for different kinds of surveillance. Many limitations imposed on law enforcement in the context of telephone wiretaps -- like the requirement that such taps be approved at the highest level of the Justice Department -- do not appear to apply to e-mail surveillance.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the Cable Act of 1984 sets a far harder burden for government agents to satisfy when trying to monitor computers using cable modems than when monitoring telephones. That has proved troublesome for law enforcement authorities as more Americans begin to use high-speed Internet service through cable networks. The Cable Act also requires that the target of the surveillance be given notice and an opportunity to challenge the request.</p>
        <p>''It's time to update and harmonize our existing laws to give all forms of technology the same legislative protections as our telephone conversations,'' Mr. Podesta said in a speech at the National Press Club. ''Our proposed legislation would harmonize the legal standards that apply to law enforcement's access to e-mails, telephone calls and cable services.''</p>
        <p>White House officials said today that they hoped the proposal would break a logjam in Congress where a variety of different measures have been introduced dealing with electronic surveillance. The administration's proposal adopts some elements of both Democratic and Republican bills.</p>
        <p>But Congressional aides said there was too little time left in the legislative session and that the matter would in all likelihood remain unresolved until after the next term begins, in 2001.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the proposal would apply to communications that either begin or end in the United States. It would not apply to e-mail messages transmitted entirely outside the country.</p>
        <p>Privacy and civil liberties groups criticized the administration's proposal because it would continue to permit the government to use a new surveillance system that the groups say may be used far more broadly than older technologies, enabling federal agents to monitor an unlimited amount of innocent communications, including those of people who are not targets of criminal investigations.</p>
        <p>The system, used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is called Carnivore, so named, agents say, because it is able to quickly get the ''meat'' in huge quantities of e-mail messages, so-called instant messaging and other communications between computers.</p>
        <p>Carnivore is housed in a small black box and consists of hardware and software that trolls for information after being connected to the network of an Internet service provider. Once installed, it has the ability to monitor all of the e-mail on a network, from the list of what mail is sent to the actual content of the communications.</p>
        <p>Marcus C. Thomas, section chief of the Cyber Technology Section of the F.B.I., said the technology was developed 18 months ago by F.B.I. engineers and has been used fewer than 25 times. Mr. Thomas said that Carnivore had potentially broad capabilities and that he understood the concerns of privacy groups.</p>
        <p>''It can do a ton of things,'' he said. ''That's why it's illegal to do so without a clear order from the court.''</p>
        <p>He said that most Internet service providers had cooperated with requests to use Carnivore.</p>
        <p>Privacy groups and some Internet service providers have been deeply critical of the use of Carnivore because, once installed on a network, it permits the government to take whatever information it wants.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the government has not said what it does with the extraneous material it gathers that is not relevant to the particular surveillance.</p>
        <p>The issue does not often arise today with the monitoring of telephone conversations because when a law enforcement authority wants to see a list of telephone calls made by a suspect, the agent gets an order from a magistrate, presents the order to a telephone company, and the company then turns over the list.</p>
        <p>In at least one instance, an Internet company did not cooperate so readily with the government. In December, federal marshals approached the company with a court order permitting them to deploy a device to register time, date and source information involving e-mail messages sent to and from a specified account.</p>
        <p>Concerned the device would record broader information, the company countered with a compromise: it would provide the government with the requested information about e-mail senders and recipients, according to Robert Corn-Revere, a lawyer for the company, in recent Congressional testimony. The company was later identified as EarthLink, a service provider with 3.5 million subscribers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corn-Revere said the government initially accepted the compromise but later became dissatisfied and wished to use its own device. EarthLink objected but was overruled by a a federal court, which ordered the device deployed.</p>
        <p>Other Internet companies have also been critical of Carnivore.</p>
        <p>William L. Schrader, chairman and chief executive of PSINet, a major commercial Internet service provider, said that the system gave the F.B.I. the ability to monitor e-mail messages of every person on a given network. He said he would refuse to permit the government to use the technology at PSINet unless agents could prove that it could only sift out the traffic from a given individual that is the target of a court order.</p>
        <p>''I object to American citizens and any citizens of the world always being subject to someone monitoring their e-mail,'' said Mr. Schrader, whose company serves about 100,000 businesses and more than 10 million users. ''I believe it's unconstitutional and I'll wait for the Supreme Court to force me to do it.''</p>
        <p>Civil liberties groups, meanwhile, said that today's policy announcement was an inadequate response to the growing controversy over the deployment of Carnivore.</p>
        <p>''Today's speech was camouflage to cover the mess that is Carnivore,'' said Barry Steinhardt, an associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union. ''In light of the public and Congressional criticism of Carnivore, we had hoped and expected far more from an administration that likes to tout its sensitivity to privacy rights. Rather than glossing over Carnivore, Podesta should have announced that the administration was suspending its use.''</p>
        <p>Facing growing concerns about Carnivore, Attorney General Janet Reno said on Thursday that she would review whether the system was being used in a manner consistent with privacy rights in the Constitution and in federal law. A subcommittee of the House is set to hold a hearing next week on the system.</p>
        <p>While the civil liberties and privacy groups applauded giving judges greater discretion to review certain kinds of requests for surveillance, they were critical of other aspects of the proposal.</p>
        <p>Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research organization that studies privacy issues and technology, criticized the administration for lowering the standards for surveillance of cable modems rather than raising the standards for telephone surveillance.</p>
        <p>''The Cable Act provides for one of the best privacy protections in the United States,'' Mr. Rotenberg said. ''The question is whether to harmonize up or harmonize down. Our view is this harmonizes down.''</p>
        <p>But administration officials said the Cable Act never contemplated that there would be broad use of cable modems for e-mail traffic and that the standards used for obtaining warrants for telephone surveillance should also apply to digital communications through cable networks.</p>
