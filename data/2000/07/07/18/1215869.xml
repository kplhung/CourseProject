        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>BUSH LEAD GETS SMALLER -- Three new polls taken over the weekend indicate that Gov. George W. Bush's lead over Vice President Al Gore is narrowing. A CBS News survey shows Mr. Bush leading Mr. Gore 43 percent to 41 percent, down from his 47-to-39 edge in May. A Zogby poll has Mr. Bush holding a 45-to-41 lead, compared with a 47-to-39 edge a month ago. And a USA Today/ CNN Gallup poll has Mr. Bush leading Mr. Gore 45 to 43, compared with 50 to 41 a week ago. The CBS poll covered 596 adults and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, meaning the Bush lead was statistically insignificant. Significantly, however, Mr. Bush's potential voters were more likely than his rival's to say they supported him enthusiastically. And when people who leaned to Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore were added to those firmly committed, Mr. Bush led 46 to 43. When Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party were added to the poll, Mr. Bush beat Mr. Gore 42 to 37, and Mr. Nader and Mr. Buchanan got 4 percent each. In the Zogby poll, which surveyed 890 likely voters and had a three percentage point sampling error, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore 43 to 37 when other candidates were added, with Mr. Nader getting 6 percent and Mr. Buchanan 3 percent. In the USA/CNN poll, which surveyed 1,063 registered voters over the weekend and has a four percentage point error margin, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore 45 to 43 when other candidates were added, with Mr. Nader picking up 5 percent and Mr. Buchanan 3 percent. The USA/CNN poll showed Mr. Gore gained support from women and independents in the past week, apparently helped by the endorsement of former Senator Bill Bradley.</p>

        <p>THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>SPENDING RECORD LIKELY TO FALL -- It's only July, and already the hard-fought Congressional contest in the Los Angeles suburbs between Representative James E. Rogan, a Republican from Pasadena, and State Senator Adam Schiff, a Burbank Democrat, is on the verge of becoming the most expensive House race ever. With about $7.5 million raised so far, the candidates seem all but certain to surpass the $8 million record set in Georgia in the 1996 contest between then-Speaker Newt Gingrich and his Democratic challenger, the cookie mogul Michael Coles. Mr. Rogan, one of the House impeachment managers in the case against President Clinton, is facing a stiff challenge in a once-Republican district that has been trending more Democratic in recent years. Liberal groups have made Mr. Rogan one of the year's top targets in the Democratic effort to regain control of the House, and by the time independent expenditures by outside groups are factored in, the overall cost of the race is sure to be even higher.</p>

        <p>THE INTEREST GROUPS</p>
        <p>A BOOST FOR BOTH CANDIDATES -- Outside interest groups combined highly visible television advertising with below-radar phone calls, direct mail and radio to play a powerful role in Al Gore and George W. Bush's primary election victories, a new nonpartisan elections study, ''Getting Inside the Outside Campaign,'' has found. The study, financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts, found that in the Democratic race, labor unions provided Mr. Gore with crucial support in his contest with former Senator Bill Bradley, particularly in the leadoff Iowa caucuses. On the Republican side, the study found that conservative groups battered Senator John McCain of Arizona, particularly in South Carolina, helping Mr. Bush rebound from a crushing defeat in New Hampshire.</p>

        <p>Correction:  July 19, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, a report in the Campaign Briefing column yesterday about a USA Today/ CNN Gallup poll on the presidential race misstated the results in some copies. In a two-way competition, Gov. George W. Bush led Vice President Al Gore 48 percent to 46 percent. (The figures 45 percent and 43 percent were their showings in a four-way competition that included Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan.)</p>
