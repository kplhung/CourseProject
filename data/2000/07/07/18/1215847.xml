        <p>Wearing a blue V-neck prison shirt that resembled the hospital scrubs he once wore to work, a former doctor pleaded not guilty today to federal charges that he killed three patients in a Long Island hospital in 1993.</p>
        <p>The former doctor, Michael J. Swango, 45, entered his plea as he was arraigned here in Federal District Court on charges that he used fraud to obtain medical posts where he then went on to kill and assault patients by injecting them with various poisons.</p>
        <p>If he is convicted, Mr. Swango could face the death penalty. The government will decide whether to seek the death penalty within the next three months, said Joseph Conway, the assistant United States attorney prosecuting the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Swango, who appeared pale and gaunt in court, with his blond hair cropped short, stood impassively as prosecutors read aloud the 17-page indictment accusing him of fraud, murder, assault and making false statements.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Swango's lawyer, Randi Chavis, said his client pleaded not guilty to the charges, the judge, Jacob Mishler, turned to Mr. Swango and asked him if that was indeed his plea.</p>
        <p>''Yes, yes,'' Mr. Swango said quietly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Swango's case has troubled law enforcement officials and medical authorities alike: although he was dogged by unsettling allegations throughout his medical career, he continued to find work as a doctor.</p>
        <p>The indictment accuses Mr. Swango of murdering a patient in 1984, as a first-year resident at Ohio State University Hospital. It states that he killed Cynthia McGee, a 19-year-old gymnast who was being treated there after she was struck by a car, by giving her a potassium injection that stopped her heart. The teenage driver who had struck her was convicted of reckless homicide and sentenced to probation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Swango was able to secure medical positions even after he served two years in prison for trying to poison several of his co-workers at an ambulance company in Illinois in 1985. Prosecutors charge that he secured some posts by fraud and by using aliases.</p>
        <p>In 1993, he was hired as a resident by the Stony Brook Health Sciences Center and posted at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Northport, N.Y. Hospital officials learned of Mr. Swango's criminal past and fired him three months after he started. He served three and a half years in prison, and would have been released Saturday had the new charges not been filed.</p>
        <p>During the brief time that he worked at Northport, prosecutors charge, Mr. Swango killed three veterans with poison injections: George Siano, 60, Thomas Sammarco, 73, and Aldo Serini. In two of the cases, Mr. Swango is accused of lying, saying that he had obtained ''do not resuscitate'' orders to ensure no attempts would be made to revive them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Siano's stepdaughter, Roselinda Conroy, sat in the front row of the courtroom today, occasionally shaking her head as the charges were read. ''It seems very unreal,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Giving what is perhaps a preview of her defense, Ms. Chavis said in court that there was ''no direct evidence'' to support the charges against Mr. Swango, indicated that she would move to have the forensic evidence in the case ruled inadmissible and complained that the government was relying on witness statements that are ''close to 20 years old.''</p>
        <p>She also accused the government of violating the laws governing pretrial publicity, giving as an example an article in The New York Times, which reported last week that prosecutors believed that Mr. Swango might have been involved in a number of other murders across the globe, but would not say how many there might be.</p>
        <p>Gary R. Brown, another assistant United States attorney prosecuting the case, denied the government had done anything wrong. Judge Mishler directed both sides to stop making public statements about the case.</p>
