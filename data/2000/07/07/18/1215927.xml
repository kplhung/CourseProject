        <p>After finding two dead crows infected with the West Nile virus on Staten Island, New York City officials announced late yesterday that they would spray about half the borough with a pesticide starting tomorrow night to try to kill mosquitoes that carry the disease before it can spread again to humans.</p>
        <p>The confirmation that the virus had returned to New York City was announced on the same day that state health officials said that for the first time this year it had also turned up in samples of mosquitoes collected in Westchester and Suffolk Counties.</p>
        <p>The two announcements offered the best evidence to date that a virus never before seen in North America until last year -- when it was blamed for seven deaths and the infection of 62 others in the New York area -- had survived the winter and was again flourishing. The findings also suggest that it may also be working its way back and forth between insects and birds, a step necessary before it can be spread to humans, health experts said.</p>
        <p>The virus can cause encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain and central nervous system that is sometimes fatal. The elderly, children under 5 and people with weakened immune systems are the most vulnerable to life-threatening cases.</p>
        <p>No human infections have been found so far this year, a point that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other city officials made repeatedly yesterday in urging city residents not to overreact. But state and city health officials again encouraged residents to use bug repellent, long-sleeved shirts or long pants when going outside at night, particularly if visiting coastal or wooded areas.</p>
        <p>''Don't panic,'' Mr. Giuliani said yesterday at a Staten Island news conference, standing next to Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city health commissioner; Guy V. Molinari, the borough president; and Richard Sheirer, the city director of emergency management.</p>
        <p>''This does not mean there has been an outbreak of West Nile virus -- yet,'' the mayor said, as he prepared to explain the pesticide effort, which is expected to be completed from the ground tomorrow and  Thursday. ''But it is absolutely necessary that we do this.'' At this point, the city has no plans to do aerial spraying.</p>
        <p>The spraying is scheduled to start at 10 p.m. tomorrow and continue until about 5 a.m. Thursday in the Rossville and Westerleigh sections of Staten Island, where the dead birds were found. City officials intend to spray a pesticide called Anvil, which has the active ingredient Sumithrin, a substance considered similar to the natural pesticide produced by chrysanthemum flowers.</p>
        <p>Anvil breaks down in sunlight and water and is considered relatively nontoxic to humans, dogs, cats and other mammals, city health officials said, but they recommended that people and their pets stay inside during the spraying, and that windows be closed and air-conditioners turned off.</p>
        <p>So far, city officials say they plan to extend the treatment to other boroughs only if they find infected birds or evidence of the virus elsewhere, but Mr. Giuliani warned, ''You have to leave all the options open to protect people's health.''</p>
        <p>The Staten Island ground spraying may be delayed by a day or so if it rains tomorrow night, officials said, because the treatment is less effective in the rain. For more information, residents may call an automated line at (877) 968-4692, or visit the city's Web site: nyc.gov/health.</p>
        <p>Suffolk, which usually sprays for mosquitoes every year, is expanding its efforts this year, with additional spraying in Lindenhurst and West Babylon tonight, from 7 to 10:30, in response to concerns about the virus. Mosquitoes that tested positive for the virus were found in Babylon.</p>
        <p>The county is considering aerial spraying, said Millie Svatek, a spokeswoman for the Suffolk County Department of Health Services. It intends to begin distributing free insect repellent today at county health centers. More information may be found on the department's Web site, www.co.suffolk.ny.us/health/.</p>
        <p>The infected crows and mosquitoes found in the New York region were identified as a result of a regional effort to quickly detect the presence of the disease. Health officials hope that by moving immediately to kill mosquitoes in areas where the disease is found and urging the public to avoid exposure to surviving insects, they can prevent a widespread outbreak. Efforts have also been under way since the start of spring to kill mosquito eggs.</p>
        <p>In New York State alone, 700 birds, thousands of mosquitoes and 200 humans have been tested so far this year. To date, 32 mosquitoes have been found with evidence of the virus -- those confirmed yesterday in Westchester and Suffolk Counties. A total of about 25 infected birds have also been found, most of them confirmed in the last two weeks, with the ones outside Staten Island picked up in Rockland, Westchester and Suffolk Counties in New York and in Bergen County in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The Westchester case was notable, state health officials said, because the virus was in a type of mosquito that feeds during the day and night, Aedes japonicus. Last year, the virus was found only in Culex pipiens mosquitoes, which are generally active only from dusk to dawn.</p>
        <p>Last month, New York City officials announced plans for ground spraying in parts of Queens, but the effort was canceled after two laboratories concluded that a chicken thought to have contracted the virus was not infected.</p>
        <p>Dr. Antonia C. Novello, the New York State health commissioner, asked the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help coordinate the response between New York and its neighbors. Throughout the region, people are being urged to eliminate standing water where mosquitoes can breed by making sure roof gutters drain properly, disposing of tires and cleaning or chlorinating swimming pools, outdoor saunas and hot tubs.</p>
        <p>Last year, the city did not begin pesticide treatment until Labor Day weekend; it did not have an intense surveillance system in place. The city also moved last year immediately to aerial spraying, first in Queens and the Bronx and then citywide. That effort was criticized by some because the city used malathion, an insecticide that some experts have associated with severe health side affects, although federal officials concluded in May that it is safe for routine use to kill mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>Health officials were somewhat divided yesterday when asked to assess the likelihood that the virus would result in human infections this year. Dr. Cohen, New York City's health commissioner, said that if governments were successful in controlling the mosquito population, they could interrupt the cycle in which the disease intensifies by moving between birds and insects.</p>
        <p>But a spokeswoman from the Centers for Disease Control, Barbara Reynolds, said yesterday that federal officials ''expect sporadic cases'' before the end of the fall, with the primary question now whether the outbreak will be widespread like last year's.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 21, 2000, Friday  An article on Tuesday about the discovery of West Nile virus in dead birds on Staten Island and several other articles since March 10 used an incorrect New York City Health Department breakdown of the figures for illnesses caused by the virus in the New York region last year. The 62 confirmed cases in 1999 included 7 deaths from encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, and 55 other cases of serious illness, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 62 cases of illness were not in addition to the deaths.</p>
