        <p>Researchers at the University of Wisconsin Medical School studied records from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Drug Abuse Warning Network, which is conducting a study of drug abuse for the federal Department of Health and Human Services. The study determined that although amounts of opiates, or narcotics used to kill pain, prescribed are increasing greatly, this does not appear to be linked to a rise in abuse.</p>
        <p>From 1990 to 1996 there were increases in the legal use of fentanyl (1,092 percent - an extremely large increase because it is now available in an easily administered patch form), morphine (49 percent), oxycodone (15 percent) and hydromorphone (12 percent) -- and a decrease in meperidine (39 percent).</p>
        <p>During the same period, total reports of drug abuse dropped from 5.1 percent to 3.8 percent. Decreases were found in abuse of fentanyl (59 percent), oxycodone (29 percent) and hydromorphone (15 percent), while the only drug for which an increase in abuse was found was morphine (up 3 percent).</p>
