        <p>To take the temperature of excess in the Hamptons this summer, join Jay Lieberman in the shower of the 12,000-square-foot house that he hopes to sell for $8 million, preferably to someone who will pay cash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, a builder, has taken a seat in the shower stall of the ''his'' bathroom in the master bedroom. He proudly points to a shower head that is 10 inches in diameter and is capable of caressing the human body with 22 gallons of water per minute (about nine times the maximum flow allowed in New York State, but unlikely to result in any legal woes). That super-size spritzer costs $800. But it is merely an appetizer for what awaits across the hall in what Mr. Lieberman calls ''the last word in bathrooms.''</p>
        <p>The ''hers'' bathroom has a skylight, radiant heat in the floors, wiring for satellite television. Like the ''his'' bath, the showpiece here is in the shower: an all-exposed, hand-machined, hand-polished, nickel-plated, thermostatic mixer with overhead shower and hand sprayer on a cradle. It costs $3,000.</p>
        <p>''There isn't anything in this house that I did not pull out all the stops for,'' Mr. Lieberman boasts. ''Whoever takes this house will be a client with a lot of money who walks in and says, 'Wow!' ''</p>
        <p>Based on the frenzied pace of speculative construction here this summer and the frazzled lives of workers doing the building, the Hamptons have never before been invaded by so many rich people wanting to be wowed and demanding that it happen fast.</p>
        <p>The invasion has driven construction costs to record levels, seduced builders, architects and even carpenters to build houses on ''spec,'' choked roads with commuting workers and encouraged subcontractors to insist on bonuses merely for showing up on time. It also has enriched and exhausted nearly everyone willing to drive a nail, paint a wall or dig a swimming pool.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's house ranks among the most expensive ever built in the Hamptons without a contracted buyer. Part of the reason it is so expensive is what goes on in its 9 1/2 bathrooms. Each bath, excepting the maid's, has faucets imported from England that cost an average of $2,000 each. The company that made them, Barber Wilsons &amp; Company Ltd., does faucets for the Queen of England and for Steven Spielberg.</p>
        <p>''You can't price yourself out of this market,'' said Carmine Cornacchio, owner of Cornacchio Electric here in Southampton. He and his crew of 20 electricians specialize in custom wiring for houses selling for $2 million to $3 million. Such houses, Mr. Cornacchio said, usually include high-tech devices that, for example, allow an owner stuck in traffic on the Long Island Expressway to turn on the hot tub with a cell phone.</p>
        <p>Echoing the sentiments of many architects, builders and subcontractors in the Hamptons, Mr. Cornacchio said that this year it has become all but impossible to put off mansion-hungry clients by charging outrageous prices.</p>
        <p>Several subcontractors said they are making record profits, and a few have used the windfall to buy big-ticket toys, like airplanes. But they also said it would be bad business to talk publicly about their new wealth. Steven Gaines, who lives in the Hamptons and whose best-selling book ''Philistines at the Hedgerow'' (Little Brown, 1998) chronicles the hijinks of rich residents, said his plumber now owns a plane. Mr. Gaines said, however, that disclosing the plumber's name would mean that he would have to find somebody else to fix his toilet.</p>
        <p>John Tortorella builds swimming pools for the rich and famous in the Hamptons. His clients have included Billy Joel, Peter Jennings and Kathleen Turner. This year, he said, has been the busiest and most lucrative of his 19 years in the swimming-pool trade. But he said overwork is making him question the meaning of success.</p>
        <p>He is exhausted, his employees are exhausted, and still the orders for bigger, more costly and more complicated swimming pools keep rolling in. Five years ago, he said, a $200,000 pool was considered ''pretty huge.'' Now, his company, J. Tortorella Swimming Pools, is rushing to complete five pools, the cheapest of which will cost $1.5 million.</p>
        <p>''Now we are talking 'backyard concepts,' with a pool, a spa, a pergola, a stone bridge, wrought iron gates,'' said Mr. Tortorella, who has begun to design his biggest pools along historical themes like the lost island of Atlantis, ancient Egypt and Stonehenge.</p>
        <p>''Everybody used to talk about the go-go 80's like they were so wonderful,'' he said. ''Well, the 80's were like child's play. It is ridiculous now. The amount of time and stress that my people have had to put up with is inhuman.''</p>
        <p>The minting of millionaires in Manhattan is far outpacing the supply of skilled labor and good property in the Hamptons, according to local government officials on the East End of Long Island.</p>
        <p>As the number of prime lots dwindles, the chief building inspectors in the towns of Southampton and East Hampton said, million-dollar houses are being built near town dumps and on misshapen or poorly drained parcels of land.</p>
        <p>''People are building on properties now that they wouldn't have even looked at 10 years ago,'' said Don Sharkey, the chief building inspector for the Town of East Hampton. ''In a couple of years, we are going to run out of buildable parcels.''</p>
        <p>The shortage of land, combined with local moratoriums on some kinds of subdivisions and the possibility of far more restrictive development rules in the near future, have  helped push home prices this year to levels that stun veteran real estate agents.</p>
        <p>''We have seen the biggest-ever across-the-board quarterly jump in home prices in the Hamptons,'' said Diane Saatchi, president of Dayton-Halstead Real Estate, which publishes a quarterly report on home prices in seven markets in the Hamptons. Figures for the first quarter of 2000 came out last week.</p>
        <p>They show that in the Village of East Hampton, summer home to the likes of Mr. Spielberg and Martha Stewart, the average price of houses has jumped in the last three years to $2.1 million from $1.2 million. More than two-thirds of that increase occurred during the first quarter of this year, according to the report.</p>
        <p>Ms. Saatchi, voicing an opinion shared by many builders and architects, speculates that the boom is fueled by continued strength in the stock market and by aging baby boomers in Manhattan who find themselves with buckets of excess money.</p>
        <p>''They have gotten to a point where they are in their prime earning years, their kids are through college, and they need houses that are big enough to accommodate several generations and kids from multiple marriages,'' said Ms. Saatchi, who has been selling real estate in the Hamptons for 14 years.</p>
        <p>Whatever their reasons, buyers are spreading so much money so fast that the craftsmen in the Hamptons are at risk of drowning in a flood of trickle-down economics. The unemployment rate in Southampton hit a record low of 2 percent this spring. For skilled labor, New York State employment officials said, the jobless rate in the Hamptons is about zero.</p>
        <p>''The East End of Long Island is the tightest skilled-construction market in the United States, without compromise,'' said Daniel McMillan, regional vice president of Trade Source, a company in Greenwich, Conn., that recruits and places craftsmen in construction jobs around the country. ''We have hired a former Navy recruiter to go around the Hamptons and talk to anybody who is wearing work boots and driving a pickup.''</p>
        <p>With more jobs than workers to fill them, Trade Source two weeks ago began offering a free carpenter's course to recent high school graduates. The first class was convened in an office building in the Suffolk County hamlet of Bohemia, about an hour's drive from the Hamptons.</p>
        <p>''I figure that if I improve my skills, I can bump my wages from $15 to at least $25 an hour out in the Hamptons,'' said John Vitale, 23, who showed up for the course. ''The money is definitely out there.''</p>
        <p>To keep pace with demand, a number of Hamptons builders have begun hiring immigrants from Central America to frame houses, shingle roofs and build swimming pools.</p>
        <p>''They broke out of the landscaping business about two years ago, and now they are rising through the trades,'' said Al Tuff, a builder in Bridgehampton who employs recent immigrants and who said his business would shut down without them.</p>
        <p>Miguel Velasquez, a Salvadoran immigrant who has been in the United States for six years, earns $23 an hour and works 12 hours a day, seven days a week, for Mr. Tuff, who also employs Mr. Velasquez's two sons, Carlos and Victor, both in their early 20's. They, too, usually work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
        <p>''There is just too much work,'' Mr. Velasquez said.</p>
        <p>Elected officials in the Hamptons are struggling to find ways to slow the pace of development, and a few are conceding that local governments have all but lost the fight.</p>
        <p>''For the last decade, we have been building houses at a rate of a house every single day,'' said Jay Schneiderman, the supervisor in the Town of East Hampton. ''We have added probably 20,000 people to our summer population without changing any significant infrastructure. That is creating tremendous stress on the quality of life in this area. It has not been a balanced approach.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schneiderman said that town governments, even with millions of dollars to spend on buying up vacant land, are finding it difficult to persuade speculators to sell.</p>
        <p>''A builder would rather build a spec house,'' Mr. Schneiderman said. ''He knows that the profit he'll yield will far exceed what he'll make selling us vacant land. That makes it difficult to preserve vacant space.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, builder of the $8 million house with the pricey shower heads, said: ''Even I realize that there is a certain amount of property that should be preserved. Things are obviously getting difficult.''</p>
        <p>Difficult or not, Cindi Crain, a former magazine editor, said she is going ahead with her dream house, which she is planning to build on two acres of land she bought for $1 million in 1998.</p>
        <p>Ms. Crain, 31, who has family money (Crain Communications, publisher of Advertising Age and Crain's New York Business), said she has been warned repeatedly by friends about the impossibility of getting a house built on time and within a budget.</p>
        <p>She has been forced by soaring design and construction prices to raise her budget for her planned 6,000-square-foot house to about $3.5 million from $1.5 million.</p>
        <p>She intends to elude the pain of summer in the Hamptons by sticking to back roads, staying away from overcrowded restaurants and never commuting from Manhattan on Fridays or Sundays.</p>
        <p>And why is this worth $3.5 million?</p>
        <p>''You really feel the sea out here. You suck in the sea air,'' Ms. Crain said. ''You can still chill out in the Hamptons, if you know what you are doing.''</p>
