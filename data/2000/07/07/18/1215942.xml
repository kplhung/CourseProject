        <p>A collector from Southern California paid $1.1 million Saturday for the rare, early 20th-century Honus Wagner tobacco card that was once co-owned by Wayne Gretzky.</p>
        <p>Brian Siegel of Santa Ana, Calif., made the 13th and final online bid on eBay for the card, which was included in cigarette packs made by the American Tobacco Company in 1909. An estimated 50 of the cards still exist.</p>
        <p>The card was considered the most expensive artifact in sports memorabilia until $3.05 million was paid for Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball.</p>
        <p>Siegel was the buyer, said a person involved in the auction, and was unavailable for comment pending a news conference today. With a 15 percent buyer's fee, the full price being paid is $1.265 million.</p>
        <p>The card was bought nearly four year ago by Michael Gidwitz, of Chicago, who paid $640,500 at auction. Previously, Gretzky and Bruce McNall, the former Los Angeles King owner, acquired the card for $451,000 in 1991, then sold it in 1996 for use in a promotional contest staged by Wal-Mart.</p>
        <p>The winner sold the card to Gidwitz to pay taxes on the prize.</p>
