        <p>Q.: Some coronary artery obstructions are described as calcified. How do they develop? Should calcium-rich foods be avoided?</p>
        <p>A.: Heart doctors generally suggest consuming plenty of calcium, though seeking out low-fat dairy products; fat and cholesterol are thought to be risky, not calcium.</p>
        <p>As people age, ''The Mayo Clinic Heart Book'' explains, the smooth, elastic artery walls normally become thicker, and their calcium content increases, in effect hardening all arteries to some degree. But the dangerous type of hardening called atherosclerosis involves chiefly the large arteries, including the coronary arteries. The inner layers of the walls become thick and irregular, and some areas accumulate fats, cholesterol and other materials. Initially, the deposits are only streaks of fatty cells. But as they enlarge, they may invade deeper layers, with scarring and calcium deposits. Large areas are called atheromas or plaque.</p>
        <p>Plaque has a firm shell that may contain calcium deposited from the blood along with areas of fatty material and a center of soft cholesterol. The shell may break open, exposing the inner part, and a blood clot tends to develop at this site. Such a clot may reduce blood flow so much that chest pain or a heart attack results.</p>
        <p>Some recent studies suggest that calcified areas of plaque may in fact be more stable than those where the buildup is chiefly fatty, and that they may be less likely to rupture and cause a heart attack.</p>
