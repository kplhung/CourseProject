        <p>Charles G. Bakaly III, the former spokesman for the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, testified today that he never misled a federal judge about the role he had played as a source for a New York Times article that discussed whether President Clinton could be indicted while in office.</p>
        <p>Taking the stand in his own defense at a trial in which he is charged with criminal contempt, Mr. Bakaly insisted that there was nothing untruthful in a sworn declaration he had provided to the judge. In it he said he had never provided any ''nonpublic information'' to The Times for the article.</p>

        <p>Charles G. Bakaly III, the former spokesman for the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, testified today that he never misled a federal judge about the role he had played as a source for a New York Times article that discussed whether President Clinton could be indicted while in office.</p>
        <p>Taking the stand in his own defense at a trial in which he is charged with criminal contempt, Mr. Bakaly insisted that there was nothing untruthful in a sworn declaration he had provided to the judge. In it he said he had never provided any ''nonpublic information'' to The Times for the article.</p>
        <p>''Was it true?'' Michele A. Roberts, a defense lawyer, asked Mr. Bakaly about his signed statement to the court in 1999.</p>
        <p>''Yes it was,'' he responded.</p>
        <p>''Does it remain true today?'' Ms. Roberts asked.</p>
        <p>''Yes it does,'' Mr. Bakaly said.</p>
        <p>The declaration was provided to Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, the chief judge of the Federal District Court here, by the office of the independent counsel during an investigation into whether anyone in the office had leaked the information that led to the article.</p>
        <p>After the declaration was filed, Mr. Bakaly gradually disclosed to investigators that he had provided the newspaper with some documents in connection with the article. He also told investigators that he may he have inadvertently confirmed some of the information that he said the reporter, Don Van Natta Jr., had told him he had learned from sources outside the counsel's office.</p>
        <p>When the office learned of these later disclosures by Mr. Bakaly, it informed Judge Johnson that the original declaration was inaccurate. Judge Johnson charged Mr. Bakaly with criminal contempt and is hearing the case without a jury. Mr. Bakaly could face up to six months in prison if convicted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakaly, a 44-year-old lawyer from California, offered a two-pronged defense today.</p>
        <p>First, he argued that in an effort to steer Mr. Van Natta away from writing the article, he had provided information that was not secret but was in documents already in the public record.</p>
        <p>Second, he argued that fellow lawyers in Mr. Starr's office had omitted some changes he had proposed in the declaration, which would have provided a more complete account of his dealings with Mr. Van Natta.</p>
        <p>The Times article, published on Jan. 31, 1999, cited unnamed associates of Mr. Starr as saying the independent counsel had concluded that he had the constitutional authority to indict Mr. Clinton while he was still serving as president.</p>
        <p>The article was published when the Senate was considering whether to convict Mr. Clinton on impeachment charges voted by the House. Mr. Clinton's lawyers complained that the article was an effort by the independent counsel's office to influence the impeachment proceedings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakaly said today that the reporter had come to him with information he said he had learned from sources outside the office about internal deliberations on whether to indict Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''I tried first to steer him from using this information,'' Mr. Bakaly testified. He said he had first told him that his sources might not be well informed. He also sent Mr. Van Natta part of an internal memorandum about how Leon F. Jaworski, the independent prosecutor during Watergate, had felt about the issue in connection with President Richard M. Nixon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakaly testified that he regretted having sent that document. Although it was historical and factual, he said, providing the document  ''caused harm to the morale in the office and harmed my colleagues.'' He said he now believed that doing so had been unwise. But he continued: ''The key thing is I did not give him any nonpublic information or information that related to grand jury matters.''</p>
        <p>Under cross-examination by John Griffith, a Justice Department lawyer, Mr. Bakaly acknowledged that  he did not initially admit he had been the source for some of the information in the article.</p>
        <p>Mr. Griffith asked Mr. Bakaly about a meeting in the office of independent counsel the Monday after the article appeared. He asked Mr. Bakaly if he had told lawyers at the meeting that there were parts of the article for which he had been responsible. Mr. Bakaly said it did not come up in the meeting.</p>
        <p>Judge Johnson urged Mr. Bakaly to answer more directly. Then he said, ''No,'' he had not talked about his role in the article.</p>
        <p>The cross-examination continues on Tuesday.</p>
