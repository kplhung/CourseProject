        <p>Page 84 of the 87-page blue-ribbon panel's report on baseball economics is the one that probably raises the most eyebrows. It lists each club's profit or loss over a five-year period, 1995 to 1999.</p>
        <p>Black ink means profit. The numbers next to only three teams are in black -- the Yankees, the Cleveland Indians, the Colorado Rockies. Red ink means loss. The Atlanta Braves, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs are among the 27 teams that have red numbers next to their names.</p>
        <p>The skeptics seriously doubt that those three teams, which are owned by news media giants, lost money. They suggest that the value of their teams' cablecasts is grossly undervalued because their owners own the cable outlets, too. The skeptics know, too, that baseball owners have been known to be less than forthcoming in certain matters.</p>
        <p>In fact, earlier this year, a federal appellate judge minced no words in his view of the owners' behavior in the mid-1980's, when they colluded against free agents in violation of the labor agreement. Writing the decision in Steve Garvey's appeal of his collusion award, Judge Stephen Reinhardt said: ''The owners' mendacity in their 1980's collusive efforts to depress the ballplayers' income was in many ways as damaging to baseball as the Black Sox scandal of 1919. The scope of the owners' deceit and fabrications in their 1980's effort to cheat their employees out of their rightful wages was wholly unprecedented, as was the financial injury suffered by the ballplayers.''</p>
        <p>The four members of the blue-ribbon panel did not create the profit-and-loss table included in last week's report. The figures on that page were provided to them, as were all of the financial figures in the report. The report, the panelists said, was wholly theirs, including the recommendations that are the focus of the report.</p>
        <p>But three people with close ties to management said that Commissioner Bud Selig reviewed various drafts of the report and sent it back for stiffer recommendations. Selig yesterday flatly denied any involvement. ''Absolutely untrue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What is clear from the final version of the report is that no high-revenue, big-spending teams had any input in its formulation. The major recommendations, covering increased sharing of local revenue and a harsher payroll tax, are aimed directly at them. In the three years the luxury tax on payrolls existed (1997 to 1999), the Yankees paid about $16 million. If the panel's formula were in effect this season, the Yankees would pay almost that amount for 2000 alone.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner, who has opted to refrain from comment on the report, will not easily accept the panel's plans if the owners decide to adopt them. Besides feeling he should not have to support poorly managed teams, the Yankees principal owner is outraged that some teams that have received funds from the existing revenue-sharing plan have pocketed the money rather than spending it on players to become more competitive.</p>
        <p>On the first page of the report, the panel writes, ''Some low-revenue clubs, believing the amount of their proceeds from revenue sharing insufficient to enable them to become competitive, used those proceeds to become modestly profitable.''</p>
        <p>Hey, George, thanks for your contribution, but I think I'll buy myself a Learjet instead of a cleanup hitter.</p>
        <p>The owners often act against their collective best interests when suggestions for improvement are made. They generally agree, for example, that some form of realignment is needed, but individually the owners say let the other guy change leagues.</p>
        <p>The report also recommends that teams with little chance for financial success be given ''the option to relocate if better markets can be identified.''</p>
        <p>The Oakland Athletics have talked of moving south to San Jose or elsewhere in Santa Clara County, but the San Francisco Giants say not so fast. That territory belongs to them, and they will not allow it to be inhabited by a rival team. For several years, there has been talk of moving a franchise to Washington, D.C., or northern Virginia, but the Baltimore Orioles claim territorial possession there.</p>
        <p>The report says a team could move into a large market that already has a team, citing enhanced economic prospects for all concerned. But how loud would the Yankees' tantrum be if a team wanted to move to northern New Jersey?</p>
        <p>While concern is focused primarily on Montreal and Minnesota as trouble spots, Florida is becoming a baseball wasteland. H. Wayne Huizenga wrecked the future of baseball in south Florida when he decimated the 1997 World Series champion Marlins, then sold the team. Despite the remarkable rebuilding job General Manager Dave Dombrowski has done with good young players, the Marlins cannot attract fans or get a new stadium.</p>
        <p>Across the state, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays are proving that baseball should never have put a team in St. Petersburg. After the franchise was awarded, but before the Devil Rays began playing, some owners thought it was a mistake that should be corrected. Now the mistake is there for all to see.</p>
        <p>''I think it is a good baseball market,'' Vincent Naimoli, the Devil Rays' managing partner, said in a recent interview. Looks sure must be deceiving.</p>
        <p>Interest in baseball is so low in Florida that the two teams could not even generate big crowds for their interleague games. Three games in south Florida drew 46,131; three in St. Petersburg drew 79,505, with the bulk of the biggest crowd (42,823) attracted by a Christian concert. ''Most of the people stayed for the game,'' a club employee said.</p>
        <p>The blue-ribbon panel didn't say anything about concerts.</p>
