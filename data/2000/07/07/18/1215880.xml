        <p>In a defeat for horse-racing interests and the casino industry, the House failed today to approve a bill to ban most forms of gambling on the Internet.</p>
        <p>A majority of House lawmakers voted in favor of the bill -- 245 supporting it, with 159 opposed -- but advocates failed to reach a two-thirds threshold required to speed its passage without amendments. Thirty members abstained.</p>
        <p>The bill attempted to curb one of the fastest-growing activities on the Internet, betting on casino-style games and sporting events. There are more than 700 wagering sites on the Web, which generate more than $1.2 billion a year, industry analysts say.</p>
        <p>The bill, which was sponsored by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, would also have prohibited the sale of lottery tickets online.</p>
        <p>''One way to promote the Internet is to make sure that the seamy side of life is dealt with on the Internet,'' Mr. Goodlatte said. He compared the unregulated spread of cybergambling to the proliferation of child pornography.</p>
        <p>The legislation was backed by an unlikely alliance of Christian evangelists, who invoked moral arguments against the explosion of gambling at home, and horse-track operators and liquor store owners, who saw it as a direct threat to their profits.</p>
        <p>But an equally odd coalition thwarted the bill, including Republican governors, online sports bookies and operators of computer casinos based in Caribbean resorts and tax havens like Antigua and Belize.</p>
        <p>Horse racing, greyhound racing and jai alai were exempted from the bill after lobbyists convinced lawmakers that it would jeopardize the use of closed-circuit television for off-track betting.</p>
        <p>Sue Schneider, the chairwoman of the Interactive Gaming Council, praised the House defeat, telling The Associated Press that ''cooler heads have prevailed here.''</p>
        <p>While Internet gambling entrepreneurs concede that their industry should be regulated -- and possibly even taxed -- Ms. Schneider argued that the proposed ban would have been unenforceable because technology was evolving so quickly and Internet operators are adept at outpacing the federal authorities.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schneider's organization called for legalizing and regulating the practice, as has already occurred in 50 other countries.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the booming industry noted that the value of online wagers is doubling every year, and is making gambling available in states where it is not legal. The Web sites are available to anyone with a credit card and a computer, making them especially enticing for compulsive gamblers, they said.</p>
        <p>About one million Americans gamble online every day, according to a recent telephone survey of Internet users by the Pew Internet and American Life Project. About five percent of all Internet users, or about 4.5 million Americans, have wagered online, the survey found.</p>
        <p>Revenues from Internet gambling are expected to exceed $3 billion by 2002, according to groups that track the industry.</p>
        <p>Despite today's defeat, Advocates of a ban said they might seek to introduce another bill under terms where a simple majority would prevail. They fell 45 votes shy of those needed today.</p>
        <p>Among the groups supporting the ban are the National Association of Attorneys General, the National Council of Churches, Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, Major League Baseball and the National Association of Convenience Stores.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration opposed the bill, with officials voicing concern over the exemptions for horse racing, dog racing and jai alai.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the bill lobbied heavily against it by drawing on money from the gaming council, an association of dozens of online betting sites whose business has grown at a pace to rival that of some major Internet retailers like Amazon.com.</p>
        <p>Many governors also registered their opposition to the legislation, saying the curbs might undercut the ability of states to raise revenues through the sale of lottery tickets online. Technology companies promoting in-home lottery sales spent hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying against the bill.</p>
        <p>The Senate approved a similar bill by voice vote in November.</p>
