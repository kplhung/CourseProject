        <p>Courtney Love's band mates in Hole were probably the first to revive them, in long ago 1998. The fashion tyro Jeremy Scott is rarely seen without one, chosen from his extensive collection. Lara Flynn Boyle, the actress, sported a sequined version to the Golden Globe Awards. And the alternative rocker Perry Farrell, the model Shalom Harlow and the designer Stella McCartney are devotees of a fashion trend that originates in the least fashionable arena you can imagine. ''Arena'' is intended literally here. What these people are wearing generally started as souvenirs from that dubious rock genre: the big-hair, heavy metal band.</p>
        <p>It is widely acknowledged that the perversity of taste knows no limits. So it wasn't entirely surprising that, as the fashion time machine lurched through the decades of the late 20th century, it made stops at 1960's helmet hair, 70's glam rock, the 80's power suit and the kitsch-pop 90's effusions of Hello Kitty. But who could have predicted a vogue for Iron Maiden T-shirts, the older, rattier and more reworked, the cooler?</p>
        <p>''It probably says something about the willingness to accept almost anything as a fashion statement without examination,'' said Howard Kramer, the assistant curator at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, whose collection includes the original rock T-shirt, made for an Elvis Presley concert in 1956. But just as likely, the trend suggests something about pop culture's renewable amnesia and appetite for cheesy aspects of the past. ''The kids who're wearing these band T-shirts wouldn't necessarily have listened to this music in the first place,'' said Laura Wills, whose Screaming Mimi stores in lower Manhattan and in Tokyo do a thriving business in $80 T-shirts made for bands like Whitesnake, Rush or Motley Crue. ''For one thing, they're too young.''</p>
        <p>But no one is too young, apparently, to escape being haunted by irony. How else to explain a model, Sophie Dahl, impersonating Debbie Harry in ads for Alexander McQueen eyewear? Or models sent out wearing Joey Ramone bangs at Martin Margiela's fall 2000 show for Hermes? Or the vision of Sarah Jessica Parker mooching around her apartment in ''Sex and the City'' wearing an oversize T-shirt showing David Bowie from the era of Aladdin Sane?</p>
        <p>No longer just the province of independent retailers like Trash and Vaudeville or Patricia Field, the trend has been seized on by national chains like Urban Outfitters, which promotes the stylishness of T-shirts originally intended for the most antifashion cohort imaginable: teenage stoners who play air guitar.</p>
        <p>''It's just, like, a big thing -- everybody's doing it,'' said Billy Basinski, the proprietor of Lady Bird, a store on Bedford Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Jammed alongside Tang-colored vases and midcentury domestic doodads, Lady Bird offers racks of T-shirts commemorating Motley Crue.</p>
        <p>The shirts themselves are vintage, a rag trade euphemism for used. But in the hands of Heidi Sjursen, the designer of Custom Heidi, they are cleaned up, fringed and studded with rhinestones and beads. ''She does all that slicing, ribs them up and makes them totally trashy 80's slut,'' Mr. Basinski said. By the time Ms. Sjursen is through, the shirts look more than authentic. They are the image of something a mall rat might have worn to see Def Leppard play the Meadowlands in the rocking summer of '89.</p>
        <p>''Stylists love them,'' Mr. Basinski said. ''Rock 'n' roll people love them. The English love them. Americans can't afford them.'' Certain of Ms. Sjursen's shirts, cut into halters, punctured with grommets and sewn into dresses, retail for over $200. ''You can't get enough AC/DC for the French,'' said Mr. Basinski, adding that other hot sellers are dresses made from T-shirts of Farrah Fawcett Majors in her best-known cheesecake pose and anything with Michael Jackson with the black glove, circa ''Thriller.''</p>
        <p>The designer Stephen Sprouse once called a torn rock T-shirt and slash of black eyeliner the perfect outfit for cocktails -- speaking for guys. Rolling Stone called the T-shirt the ''ultimate rock garment,'' proposing it as a ''$10 signifier.'' But even in the early days of the rock T-shirt, which by consensus originated in the late-60's flowering of psychedelic rock in San Francisco, they were rarely cheap. As early as 1974, Rolling Stone reported, fans were offering $100 for thrusting tongue T-shirts marking the 1972 Rolling Stones American tour.</p>
        <p>The most democratic, adaptable and seasonless article of apparel, the T-shirt most likely evolved from Civil War union suits and the long john. It went on to become civilian America's uniform after soldiers who had received them as standard issue came home from World War II. Marlon Brando helped popularize T-shirts as outer wear in ''The Wild One.'' But, Alice Harris wrote in ''The White T'' (HarperCollins, 1996), it was not until Senator John F. Kennedy was photographed relaxing at his Georgetown town house in 1959 that the T-shirt, ''socially speaking, arrived.''</p>
        <p>By the late 70's, three out of 10 Americans owned a T-shirt bearing some sort of design. Some 48,000 T-shirt companies enjoyed a total of $3 billion to $5 billion in revenues. ''T-shirts used to be more of a premium piece than a commercial piece,'' Mr. Kramer of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame said. ''People who had them invariably worked security for the shows. They were swag.''</p>
        <p>It was not until arena rock took hold that artists saw T-shirts as ''an enormous revenue stream,'' Mr. Kramer said. ''They made a lot of people a lot of money. Artists who never saw a dime out of record sales used T-shirts as a way to survive.''</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, given their seeming ubiquity, vintage T-shirts do not seem to have survived in enormous quantities. ''I scour the country,'' said Ms. Wills, the proprietor of Screaming Mimi, whose New York branch is on Lafayette Street. ''They're not that easy to find. I just found six good ones with dates. There are tons of companies doing knockoffs of the old shirts, but that's not what the kids want.'' Ms. Sjursen relies on a Salvation Army connection in her hometown, which she declined to name. ''And wherever I go, I raid all the thrift shops,'' she said.</p>
        <p>It is precisely the shirts worn until, as Mr. Sprouse put it, they feel silky that are most coveted. ''The older, the better,'' Ms. Wills said. ''The grungier, the better. People really like them worn.'' The true rock faithful seek out T-shirt rarities: the infamous Vivienne Westwood design for the Sex Pistols, depicting Queen Elizabeth II pierced by a safety pin, or else shirts printed with images of cult musicians, like the glam rock New York Dolls. For the most part, however, people embrace the irony of wearing a Whitesnake T-shirt to hip downtown events like the Thursday night party Ultra, held at a club called Spa.</p>
        <p>''It's hit a peak,'' said Ive Bjork, the assistant manager at Patricia Field on Eighth Street, where rock T-shirts customized by designers known as Halah and Self Mart sell for as much as $400. ''Stylists, men from Boston, everyone's buying them,'' Ms. Bjork said. ''You get such a glimpse of what type of person it is from what they're into.''</p>
        <p>At the store Filthmart on East 13th Street, whose stock is mainly discontinued merchandise recovered from warehouses, the top sellers are AC/DC, Motley Crue, Led Zeppelin and Iggy Pop. And at Ms. Sjursen's Web page, www.hoverground.com, the hot shirts of the moment feature Skid Row and the American flag logo from the Rolling Stones ''Steel Wheels'' tour.</p>
        <p>''I started out doing typical rocked-out T-shirts,'' said Ms. Sjursen, whose new designs venture into the world of shirts with cigarette ads. ''I did them all, Skid Row and Motley Crue. But never Bon Jovi. I draw the line at Bon Jovi, O.K.?''</p>
