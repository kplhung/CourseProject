        <p>It was not the most conventional way for an aspiring president of Uganda to warm up a crowd. But it seemed to work.</p>
        <p>''Thank you,'' Nasser Ntege Sebaggala said at a rally downtown recently, ''for welcoming me at the airport when I was coming from jail in America.''</p>
        <p>The crowd rose up in cheers remembering that day in February, when Mr. Sebaggala, 52, a businessman and former mayor of Kampala, arrived home after serving one year of a 15-month federal prison term for passing bad checks in Boston. Flowers were uprooted along the route from the airport and strewn on the road. He took six hours for what normally might be an hour's ride.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sebaggala has become a political phenomenon in Uganda, despite his obvious flaws. He is a convicted fraud. He is not well educated.</p>
        <p>His English, the lingua franca of Uganda, is not only atrocious but comical. One of the national newspapers cruelly ran a verbatim transcript of an interview in English not long after came home. His native tongue is Luganda, the language of Uganda's largest ethnic group.</p>
        <p>The truth is, he is popular because of his flaws, not to mention a well-honed populist touch. In the same way that some Americans may see a bit of themselves in Bill Clinton's indiscretions, some Ugandans who feel left behind in the nation's slow economic revival embrace the entire package of Mr. Sebaggala. They actually like the idea that he may have stolen $44,000 in one of the world's richest countries.</p>
        <p>''We need Sebaggala,'' Mark Mukiibi, 25, a teacher, said at the rally. ''He knows the people of the Uganda. He understand the problems of Ugandans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mukiibi dismissed any suggestion that Mr. Sebaggala's stint in prison might make it hard for him to run for president. ''That was a very short time,'' he said. ''It was not even a year.''</p>
        <p>The question is whether Mr. Sebaggala can, in fact, translate that popularity into the presidency. Early next year, Ugandans will elect a leader for only the third time in 21 years. If he runs -- and he says he will -- Mr. Sebaggala will face President Yoweri Museveni, who is his opposite in nearly every way.</p>
        <p>Mr. Museveni, in office since he fought his way to power in 1986, graduated from Dar es Salaam University in Tanzania and is able to make campaign speeches into little history lessons. His English is flawless. He is a military man, while Mr. Sebaggala is a businessman. Mr. Museveni's career was in many ways formed against the dictatorship of Idi Amin in the 1970's, while Mr. Sebaggala's businesses did quite well then.</p>
        <p>Mr. Museveni is often given credit for turning Uganda around after the ravages of Mr. Amin and another dictator, Milton Obote. But many people say Mr. Sebaggala's popularity is a reflection of the things still undone. Poverty and unemployment are still high. Uganda's involvement in the war in neighboring Congo is unpopular. Many people are tired of Mr. Museveni after 14 years in office and would like the political system, a so-called no-party state, opened up.</p>
        <p>''There is so much cynicism'' about Mr. Museveni, said Charles Onyango-Obbo, the editor of The Monitor, an independent national newspaper. ''They are just throwing Sebaggala in his face.''</p>
        <p>''People were laughing at him'' when he first returned home, Mr. Onyango-Obbo said of Mr. Sebaggala. ''He couldn't speak proper English. But it's made him terribly popular.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sebaggala, one of 23 children in a Muslim family of several wives, began his career as a sales representative of a dairy company in the early 1970's. In 1973 he started a textile company and became one of the leading businessmen in Kampala, as black Africans took over the economy after Mr. Amin expelled the ethnic Indian business class in the early 1970's. He was mentioned in newspaper articles as Uganda's youngest millionaire.</p>
        <p>In April 1998 he beat the incumbent mayor of Kampala, Christopher Iga, who was backed strongly by Mr. Museveni, in a vote seen as a rebuke to the president. Soon after his election, he attended a conference on garbage disposal in the United States and ended up arrested in Boston. He was charged with passing eight fraudulent traveler's checks worth $44,000 and was convicted in December 1998.</p>
        <p>In Uganda, trafficking in fake currencies and traveler's checks became a way of life for a certain class of businessman as Mr. Museveni liberalized the economy and foreign exchange in the late 1980's. But Mr. Sebaggala, who opened a foreign exchange business in 1992, denied that he had done anything wrong.</p>
        <p>In an interview he said that among $2.5 million in deposits he had made in the Bank of Boston were some bad traveler's checks that a few customers had passed him without his knowledge. ''I say you can't put me as responsible,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The prison term only made his legend grow. He was released in December 1999, and his homecoming was a national event. He made his political ambitions clear as soon as he arrived.</p>
        <p>''I am no longer a businessman,'' he said at the time. ''I am a full-time politician.'' Then the next day: ''I have come not only to liberate this country but to bring a revolution. If I am arrested you should not demand for my bail, because most people cannot afford the bail fee.''</p>
        <p>Since then he has campaigned around Uganda, at one point being shot at by government soldiers in the town of Mbarara, in what the government said was a mistake and Mr. Sebaggala says was an attempt on his life. He was a strong supporter of a boycott of the referendum held in June on whether to continue Mr. Museveni's ''no party'' system.</p>
        <p>For all his talk of revolution, Mr. Sebaggala is not proposing anything especially radical. He wants a return to multiparty politics. He wants to increase the use of irrigation in farming, which employs more than 80 percent of Ugandans. He wants to attract more foreign business, particularly technology companies. He says he would expand education.</p>
        <p>He said many of his political ideas had come from his time in the United States, which he said he admired very much despite the prison term. There is one area especially in which he would like Uganda to be more like the United States.</p>
        <p>''Always when I am in campaign I mention your countrymen, like George Washington,'' he said. ''You remember that they tried to put him for a third term? He said it was enough and the young generation should take over. What he did was great.</p>
        <p>''I give the example that the more than 40 presidents, they relinquished power and have been buried in America. None of them went into exile.''</p>
        <p>In Uganda, since independence from Britain in 1963, every president has gone into exile. If all goes well, he would like to make Mr. Museveni the first not to.</p>
