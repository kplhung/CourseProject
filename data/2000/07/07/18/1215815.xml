        <p>Marianne Gingrich, who was divorced in December from Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, has met with several New York publishers to sell a proposed book about her life with him, according to her agent, Edward Jay Acton.</p>
        <p>The book will describe Ms. Gingrich's role as a behind-the-scenes partner in Mr. Gingrich's rise and the intimate witness to his fall. ''She really wants to show how Washington has changed over the last 20 years for women, especially because of the increased attention from the media,'' Mr. Acton said.</p>

        <p>Marianne Gingrich, who was divorced in December from Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, has met with several New York publishers to sell a proposed book about her life with him, according to her agent, Edward Jay Acton.</p>
        <p>The book will describe Ms. Gingrich's role as a behind-the-scenes partner in Mr. Gingrich's rise and the intimate witness to his fall. ''She really wants to show how Washington has changed over the last 20 years for women, especially because of the increased attention from the media,'' Mr. Acton said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gingrich married Mr. Gingrich in 1981, when he was a young Republican congressman. He had recently divorced his first wife, Jackie, who had been his high school math teacher.</p>
        <p>Newt and Marianne Gingrich were separated in May 1999, after Mr. Gingrich left office and it had been disclosed that he had been having a affair the previous six years with an aide, Callista Bisek. In August, Mr. Gingrich, who is 56, plans to marry Ms. Bisek, 33.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gingrich's proposed book will discuss her husband's affair, but ''this is not a get-Newt or a get-even book,'' Mr. Acton said. Mr. Acton compared her book to ''What I Saw at the Revolution,'' by Peggy Noonan, a speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan. Ms. Gingrich has not yet sold the book, Mr. Acton said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gingrich, 48, will write the book in the first person with the help of Katherine Johnson. Ms. Johnson has written authorized biographies of the authors Anne Rice and Dean Koontz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Acton has represented authors who could primarily be considered liberals, including James Baldwin, Ralph Nader and Thomas P. O'Neill, a former Democratic speaker of the House. Ms. Gingrich, who remains a Republican, met her agent through a friend, Susan O'Neill, O'Neill's daughter.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gingrich was unavailable for comment. A spokesman for Mr. Gingrich's office said he declined to comment.</p>
