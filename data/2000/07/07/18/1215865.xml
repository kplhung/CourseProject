        <p>A tugboat towing a 72-foot dot-com billboard was back on the Hudson River yesterday, against the wishes of New York officials but to the delight of the sign's sponsors, who found a familiar solution to the hassles of the big city: move to New Jersey.</p>
        <p>But city lawyers were not conceding that the tugboat Gunny had found a sanctuary across the state line.</p>
        <p>The battle on the low seas started last Wednesday, when a New York City building inspector boarded a police boat in Manhattan, cut through the murky waters of the Hudson and issued a notice of violation to the Gunny, which, the inspector said, was illegally towing a barge with a yellow and red billboard bearing the phrase ''DIRTPILE.com.''</p>
        <p>The tug was on the last leg of a marketing voyage from Boston that had taken it through Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York. But a New York City zoning rule prohibits vessels from wending the city's waterways with signs that can be seen from the arterial highways or manufacturing districts. Violators can be fined as much as $5,000. The city inspector ordered the captain to chug out of the city's jurisdiction, to someplace like the Tappan Zee Bridge.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, however, the billboard  was back. As the afternoon sun climbed high, the tug could be seen blithely towing the sign up and down the Hudson, spreading word of Dirtpile.com, a Web site that deals in heavy equipment.</p>
        <p>Larry Corbeil, Dirtpile's chief operating officer, said the company's maritime lawyers had read the city's zoning rules, studied the nautical charts and found the perfect loophole: New Jersey, where city zoning rules no longer apply, he said.</p>
        <p>''All we're doing is complying with the law,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corbeil would not admit to thumbing his nose at regulators (''Please don't say I'm thumbing my nose,'' he said. ''You can't fight City Hall.'') but he did admit to a certain amount of glee (''All of this media attention, you can't beat that.'').</p>
        <p>As promotional gambles go, he said, the voyage of the Gunny has been a success, even at the $90,000-a-month cost of keeping the tug-and-barge afloat. He said he was going to pull it out of town, but a television producer called ''and said, 'Please don't go until we do our story' ''</p>
        <p>The city, for its part, said the dispute was not settled, and its lawyers were reviewing the zoning rules. ''From what I understand, our jurisdiction extends to the low-water mark of New Jersey,'' said Paul Wein, a spokesman for the Building Department. ''If we feel we are right, we will take further enforcement action.''</p>
        <p>New York City's Board of Estimate adopted the regulation covering signs on the water in the 1970's, after a similar fight over a billboard on a barge in the East River. But the issue of jurisdiction may be a bit murkier in the Hudson, which is overseen not only by various state and city authorities but also by a number of New Jersey towns.</p>
        <p>When told yesterday that the city thought the Building Department's regulatory power over signs extended to the waters of a neighboring state, Mr. Corbeil of Dirtpile laughed heartily. ''Oh, come on,'' he said. ''Really?''</p>
        <p>Then he tried to get serious. ''I shouldn't laugh,'' he said, before laughing some more.</p>
        <p>Later in the day, Jay Cashman, the owner of Dirtpile and also of a large marine contracting company in Boston, said his lawyers had told him they did not believe New York's authority reached to the New Jersey shore. ''This whole thing just smacks of somebody with too little to do,'' he said. ''With all of the things going on in New York City, the building inspectors don't have anything else to look at? I mean, Goodyear gets its blimp, right?''</p>
