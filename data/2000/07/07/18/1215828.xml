        <p>Hoping to increase their presence on both coasts and overseas, two large United States law firms -- one in California and one in New York -- announced plans to merge yesterday.</p>
        <p>The combination of Pillsbury Madison &amp; Sutro, based in San Francisco, and Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam &amp; Roberts, based in New York, would create one of the nation's largest law firms, with more than 860 lawyers in 16 offices.

        <p>Hoping to increase their presence on both coasts and overseas, two large United States law firms -- one in California and one in New York -- announced plans to merge yesterday.</p>
        <p>The combination of Pillsbury Madison &amp; Sutro, based in San Francisco, and Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam &amp; Roberts, based in New York, would create one of the nation's largest law firms, with more than 860 lawyers in 16 offices. The merger would especially address a weakness for Pillsbury, whose lawyers handle international business, though only one is based abroad.</p>
        <p>The move comes after similar deals among American and international law firms over the last two years.</p>
        <p>The combined firm, which will be called Pillsbury Winthrop, is expected to have more than $400 million in revenue next year, which would make it one of the top 20 firms in the United States in terms of revenue.</p>
        <p>''The two firms have a shared vision of creating a major U.S. law firm in our core practice areas in which we match up very well,'' said John F. Pritchard, the chairman of Winthrop, which, like Pillsbury, specializes in merger and acquisitions, finance, complex litigation and capital markets. ''We have a vision of creating a strong national firm headquartered on both coasts and globalizing that firm.''</p>
        <p>The proposed combination, which the firms called a merger of equals, is intended to bolster Winthrop's technology practice, especially in the Silicon Alley area of New York, Mr. Pritchard said. Pillsbury, which has 81 lawyers in its Silicon Valley office, bulked up its technology law arm when it merged with Cushman Darby &amp; Cushman of Washington in 1996.</p>
        <p>As for Pillsbury, the merger would increase the firm's international presence, said Marina Park, Pillsbury's managing partner. Though Pillsbury, which has 596 lawyers, is more than twice the size of Winthrop, the majority of its revenue comes from domestic clients. The firm's sole international office consists of one partner based in Tokyo. Winthrop has offices in Tokyo, London, Hong Kong and Singapore; more than half of the company's revenue comes from abroad.</p>
        <p>The partners of both firms will vote on the merger later this year. Mary B. Cranston, the chairwoman of Pillsbury, would be chairwoman of the combined firm. Mr. Pritchard would be vice chairman.</p>
        <p>Both firms have seen revenue drop in comparison with their competitors, according to the rankings in The American Lawyer magazine. Winthrop, which ranked 93rd in 1998, dropped to 100 in 1999. Pillsbury, ranked 44th in 1998, fell to 46th.</p>
        <p>Like many of their United States and international counterparts, both companies have been searching for a partner for some time. Pillsbury started seriously looking for a New York-based partner in January 1999, after Ms. Cranston was named chairwoman. Winthrop has been considering merging for two years.</p>
        <p>''The key thing is to globalize our practices because our clients are globalizing and, more importantly, our competition is globalizing,'' Mr. Pritchard said. ''Almost every law firm in the United States that we know of is not only thinking about merging with other firms, but many of them are in active discussions. We are really at the forefront of mergers.''</p>
