        <p>It was a quiet Sunday morning in the middle of the Middle East summit talks when President Clinton picked up the telephone at Camp David and tried to defuse a conflict closer to home.</p>
        <p>For days, Mr. Clinton, acting as a presidential peacemaker, had been discussing the complicated issues dividing the Palestinians and Israelis. But when he called Mortimer B. Zuckerman, publisher of The New York Daily News, Mr. Clinton was pushing another aspect of his final-year legacy: the election of his wife to the Senate.</p>
        <p>With six months to go in his term, Mr. Clinton's power is waning. But his influence is far from gone, and he can still grab a headline, in this case a screaming one that read in part, ''Prez Defends Hil on Slur.''</p>
        <p>The president speaks regularly to Hillary Rodham Clinton about her New York Senate bid, and her campaign was reeling from a front-page story in Saturday editions of The New York Post. It concerned accusations made in a new book about the Clintons by a former reporter for The National Enquirer that Mrs. Clinton had used an anti-Semitic slur during an argument in 1974.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, during a lull in the summit talks, decided to strike back, going beyond a brief statement denying the allegation that his aides had issued on his behalf.</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Clinton's call was a rash act or a counteroffensive coordinated with Mrs. Clinton, it seemed to backfire. In an interview set up by Mr. Zuckerman, Mr. Clinton made passing remarks about the summit talks, violating a news blackout that the White House itself had set. And his effort to snuff out a story damaging to his wife seemed only to add fuel to it.</p>
        <p>It was another example of Mr. Clinton acting on his own instincts, which have both served him and failed him in the past.</p>
        <p>''This was an extraordinary circumstance,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said today, seeking to explain the phone calls he learned of only after the fact. ''You know, we live in a world where the National Enquirer mentality has hijacked journalism, and that has become an issue in New York. And these are scurrilous and untrue charges, and the president wanted to set that straight.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, at the end of the interview with Michael Kramer, the paper's managing editor, commented briefly that he was more optimistic about the peace talks than when they first began last week. The remark itself was harmless but it was uttered after officials had agreed to withhold any comment until the talks were over. Mr. Lockhart said the comments were ''outside the rules'' but warranted by the circumstances.</p>
        <p>Though no substance about the peace talks came up during the phone interview, the potential was there for the Sunday chat to interfere with the negotiations.</p>
        <p>''It certainly was not supposed to be an interview that dealt with the peace process,'' a presidential aide said today. ''It just happened.''</p>
        <p>White House stenographers usually listen in on Mr. Clinton's telephone interviews and prepare instant, official transcripts. Not this time. Aides learned of the interview after it took place and scurried Sunday night to recover from The Daily News a transcript of the remarks dealing with the Middle East for release to the rest of the news media.</p>
        <p>''It's ironic that when he's trying to bring peace to the Middle East he had to take a break to ensure peace among Jews in New York,'' a Democratic strategist in Washington said.</p>
        <p>The president and Mr. Zuckerman know each other well. They have traveled together to the Middle East and played cards aboard Air Force One. Mr. Clinton, aides said, considers The Daily News the friendlier of the two New York tabloids.</p>
        <p>In their Sunday morning conversation, said two people with knowledge of the call, Mr. Clinton told Mr. Zuckerman that there was no truth to the accusations made in the book ''State of the Union,'' by Jerry Oppenheimer. Like The Post, The News wrote about the book in its Saturday editions, though the article was not featured on its front page.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zuckerman arranged for the president to speak on the record to Mr. Kramer, whom Mr. Clinton also knows. Mr. Kramer's former wife, Kimba M. Wood, had been an early Clinton choice for attorney general before her name was withdrawn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kramer called Camp David early in the afternoon. Mr. Clinton called back about 5:30 p.m., unleashing a vigorous defense of his wife.</p>
        <p>''I was there and she never said it,'' the president said, according to the article -- labeled as an ''exclusive interview'' -- in The Daily News. ''In 29 years, my wife has never, ever uttered an ethnic or racial slur against anybody, ever. She's so straight on this, she squeaks.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton went beyond rebutting the facts. As both he and his wife have done, the president framed the allegation as the latest in a string of attacks by political enemies.</p>
        <p>''This is part of the pattern,'' he said. ''They couldn't defeat me politically, and they can't defeat her politically, so they go after us personally.''</p>
