        <p>ABC News said yesterday that the National Football League had agreed to change the starting times of two Monday night preseason games, a decision that will allow the network to devote an hour of prime-time coverage each to the opening nights of the Democratic and Republican national conventions.</p>
        <p>The network had earlier announced that it would not pre-empt the football games and would provide prime-time convention coverage on those nights -- Monday, July 31, when Republicans convene in Philadelphia, and Monday, Aug. 14, when Democrats gather in Los Angeles -- only during halftime.</p>

        <p>ABC News said yesterday that the National Football League had agreed to change the starting times of two Monday night preseason games, a decision that will allow the network to devote an hour of prime-time coverage each to the opening nights of the Democratic and Republican national conventions.</p>
        <p>The network had earlier announced that it would not pre-empt the football games and would provide prime-time convention coverage on those nights -- Monday, July 31, when Republicans convene in Philadelphia, and Monday, Aug. 14, when Democrats gather in Los Angeles -- only during halftime.</p>
        <p>David Westin, president of ABC News, said yesterday that network officials decided to approach the N.F.L. about helping them make room for the conventions after concluding that the lineup of speakers for the opening nights had considerable news value.</p>
        <p>Gen. Colin L. Powell and Laura Bush, wife of Gov. George W. Bush, are to speak on the opening night in Philadelphia, while the Democrats have tentative plans to have President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton address the delegates on the first night in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Westin said Robert A. Iger, president of ABC's parent, the Walt Disney Company, had taken a lead role in discussions with N.F.L. officials about how convention coverage might be accommodated. As a result, the games will start an hour earlier, at 7 p.m. rather than 8 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, ABC officials said. That should allow convention coverage to start about 10 p.m.</p>
        <p>ABC thus will be broadcasting live from the conventions on all four nights of each, just as it did four years ago, and will provide gavel-to-gavel coverage on its Web site and in multiple daily Webcasts.</p>
        <p>CBS News announced yesterday that it would broadcast on all four nights of each convention, including special editions of its magazine programs ''48 Hours'' and ''60 Minutes II'' on the Monday and Tuesday of each. The network will devote an hour of prime time on each Wednesday and two hours on each Thursday.</p>
        <p>NBC News has said it will televise all four nights of each convention on its MSNBC cable channel and provide live coverage on the flagship NBC network on the final two nights of both.</p>
