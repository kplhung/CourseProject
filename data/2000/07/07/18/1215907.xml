        <p>With higher sales of fabricated products, Alcan Aluminium Ltd. more than doubled its second-quarter profit to $153 million, or 70 cents a share, on a 14 percent gain in revenue to just over $2 billion. The results were one cent shy of the mean estimate of nine brokers polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. Although the price of aluminum dropped 9 percent in the second quarter from the first, Jacques Bougie, president of the Montreal-based Alcan, said the outlook for demand and prices ''remains encouraging.'' He also said Alcan and Algroup of Switzerland expected to complete their merger in the fourth quarter.</p>
