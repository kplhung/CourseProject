        <p>Brittany Crist had bounced between three 401(k) plans in 12 years. She had been through a raft of Fidelity funds and bought shares in Intel, Oracle and Microsoft. She had even kept up with the very latest books on investing. But it was the Web that finally inspired her to form the Dart Throwin' Monkeys.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, Ms. Crist, 30, who works for Verizon Communications in St. Petersburg, Fla., whipped together the investment club in a few months by recruiting members in an online chat room at Motley Fool, a Web site devoted to investor education.</p>
        <p>After enlisting a soldier, a lawyer, a software engineer, a fireman, a toy store manager, another telecommunications worker and ''two administrative types,'' Ms. Crist and the eight other Dart Throwin' Monkeys (more on that later) turned to Bivio, a new Internet company based in Boulder, Colo., that offers services for investment clubs, to build a private site where they could communicate, store minutes from their meetings and keep tabs on which member was worth what, when.</p>
        <p>The Dart Throwin' Monkeys could not be confused with the Beardstown Ladies. After all, some of the Ladies, affable elders from Beardstown, Ill., who created a cottage industry around their investment club in the mid-90's before an accounting error deflated their returns, say they still do not even have computers.</p>
        <p>No, the Monkeys are a new breed, taking advantage of a new crop of Internet companies offering one-stop shops for investment clubs at no cost. These companies merge communication tools with software engines that handle complex administrative bookkeeping and compile tax returns. And although sites like Motley Fool have long provided a forum for investment club members, the new sites take the clubs one step further.</p>
        <p>Bivio and another fledgling company, Actifunds of Cambridge, Mass., also act as digital matching services for people who want to form clubs. Bivio, which opened in December, has already signed up 1,700 clubs.</p>
        <p>''Investment clubs, in contrast to mutual funds or the brokerage industry, are a cottage industry,'' said Robert Brooker, chairman of Actifunds, which is completing its seed round of financing before it opens shop. ''That's why we look at the total amount of assets in investment clubs, we believe about $10 billion, as just the beginning of the growth.''</p>
        <p>A third Internet venture, Foliofn, which began in May, lets investors cheaply assemble mutual fund-like portfolios and plans to expand its services to accommodate investment clubs. And message board sites, operated by prominent Internet companies, are paying attention.</p>
        <p>''The investment club space is an important space,'' said Bryan A. Burdick, the top executive at Silicon Investor, a stock chat site that is a unit of Go2Net. ''We think it's a natural fit for the Silicon Investor community.''</p>
        <p>Currently, over 36,000 domestic clubs with an estimated $1.5 billion in assets are members of the National Association of Investors Corporation, a 49-year-old nonprofit organization that has been the main resource for investment clubs until now.</p>
        <p>''People are craving ways to bring other people into their investing experience, that's why the stock discussion sites are so popular,'' said Ion Yadigaroglu, 30, co-founder and chief executive of Bivio. Two years ago, he formed his own club, Cosmic Horizon. It was an epiphany for Mr. Yadigaroglu, an astronomer who grew up in the United States and Switzerland.</p>
        <p>Though he earned his Ph.D. in astrophysics at Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif., it was the Internet that was on his mind. Jeff Skoll, eBay's first employee, was one of his roommates.</p>
        <p>''I spent '92 to '97 in Palo Alto, so you couldn't avoid the Internet, you couldn't avoid being involved,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But not everyone is so enthusiastic about his new online venture. Bivio's  software application that matches new users to existing members has led executives of the nonprofit group to question whether online solicitations run afoul of Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.</p>
        <p>At issue is the notion of connecting people who might not all contribute equally. In such cases, an investment club might be subject to regulation as a mutual fund, according to S.E.C. rules. Membership interests in a club are considered securities ''if members invest and expect to make a profit from the entrepreneurial and managerial efforts of others,'' the agency's Web site says, as opposed to sharing in stock picking.</p>
        <p>''If you've got an investment club and you advertise for members, you're selling securities,'' said Robert A. O'Hara, an N.A.I.C. vice president. ''The S.E.C. frowns on that kind of activity. We have 117 chapters around the country, and they are not allowed to advertise that they have clubs looking for members.''</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. has not made any direct comment on Bivio or the concept behind it, but one former official said she did not see a problem in the online migration of clubs.</p>
        <p>''It's a natural evolution that clubs would move online and do most of their organizational work online,'' said Nancy M. Smith, a securities lawyer and former director of the S.E.C. Office of Investor Education and Assistance, who now works for Foliofn.</p>
        <p>There is reason for the N.A.I.C. to see Bivio as something of a threat. While the N.A.I.C. primarily considers itself an educational organization, it does sell accounting software. Bivio gives it away. Even so, Phyllis Pawlovsky, a former president of the New York chapter of N.A.I.C., sits on Bivio's advisory board and thinks the two are complementary.</p>
        <p>''As a member of both organizations, I feel that both do their share in increasing investment opportunities for the little guy,'' she said. ''N.A.I.C. teaches you how to evaluate companies. Bivio lets you do it online and join an online community.''</p>
        <p>A more pressing question might be whether these companies can be profitable. Bivio makes money by directing its users to third-party services advertised on its site, like an online broker called BUYandHOLD.com, and then sharing the revenue.</p>
        <p>''If these companies are indeed successful at creating a compelling proposition for community investing and then use that to extend relationships with the online brokerages, then it would indeed be very valuable,'' said Andrew Goldfarb, who runs the Boston office of the venture capital firm Jafco Ventures.</p>
        <p>Offline or online, the intent of investment clubs now seems about the same as it ever was: to learn.</p>
        <p>Ms. Crist had read Suze Orman, the personal finance empowerment guru, and Peter Lynch, the former manager of Fidelity Magellan, and the Beardstown Ladies' best sellers. Still, she did not feel like she knew that much.</p>
        <p>''I consider myself between a beginner and a novice,'' she said.</p>
        <p>So far, the Monkeys have ponied up a total of $985 after their first round of monthly dues, about $30 to $50. Now, they are weighing the merits of Kmart versus Target and Oracle versus Sun.</p>
        <p>The Web aside, they still do some things the old way. Ms. Crist picked from a Florida-focused Motley Fool board, so her club could meet once a month in person. And the Monkeys prefer to pay for N.A.I.C.'s accounting software, rather than totally entrust their bookkeeping to the free tools offered by an untested dot-com.</p>
        <p>So what about that name? Ms. Crist explains that another member took it from the 1973 best seller ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street,'' by  Burton G. Malkeil. In the book, Mr. Malkeil, a Princeton professor, says a blindfolded primate tossing darts at the business section of a newspaper could outperform the average investment professional.</p>
        <p>For the record, Professor Malkeil actually wrote of a dart-throwing chimpanzee. But whatever the animal, the Monkeys are confident they can hit the mark.</p>
        <p>''We think we can do better than the experts on Wall Street,'' Ms. Crist said.</p>
