        <p>Ernie Els could make history at the British Open this week, but he does not want to.</p>
        <p>After finishing second at the Masters and tying for second at the United States Open, Els could become the first player to finish second in three consecutive majors.</p>
        <p>Finishing first, however, is what Els has in mind. After winning the Standard Life Loch Lomond tournament in Scotland on Saturday, Els has moved up to No. 3 in the world ranking, and he heads into the first round Thursday as one of the favorites.</p>
        <p>''I know the course as well as anybody,'' Els said of the Old Course at St. Andrews, one of golf's most historic settings. ''I'm not going to read the papers, so you can write what you want. I just want to go in there with my game plan, and I know there's one guy you have to beat.''</p>
        <p>That guy would be Tiger Woods, the world's No. 1 player, who will enter the tournament as the overwhelming favorite. But Els has enough experience and confidence to not be intimidated by Woods should they both find themselves in contention come Sunday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Els and Woods opened the year with a memorable duel at the Mercedes Championships in January, with Woods defeating Els on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff. That set the tone for the way Woods would gain the upper hand on Els -- and everyone else -- for the rest of the season.</p>
        <p>Els would love another crack at Woods, particularly at a major championship. ''He's the best player in the world by far,'' Els said. ''Any course, if he's on his game, he's going to bring that course to its knees.</p>
        <p>''At least I'm playing well, and I've said in the past that if I'm playing well I can play with him. I know he's going to do well. I've just got to stick to my guns. Let's play four days and see what happens. He'll probably win, but let's see. Everybody has a fair chance on Thursday morning.''</p>
        <p>Easygoing Surroundings</p>
        <p>The atmosphere at St. Andrews was low key today, yet many players were on the course for practice rounds. It was a calm day by weather standards at St. Andrews, with moderate winds and afternoon temperatures around 60 degrees.</p>
        <p>Many American players have been in Scotland since last week, giving them a lot of time to recover from jet lag. David Duval, Phil Mickelson and Tom Lehman played in the Loch Lomond event. Woods, Mark O'Meara and Lee Janzen practiced in Ireland before coming to St. Andrews.</p>
        <p>Here is the early scouting report on the course: The fairways and greens are hard and fast. Expect to see many bump-and-run shots, with players intentionally landing their approach shots short of the green and allowing the ball to run up onto the putting surface. Players will also putt from well off the putting surface, instead of chipping onto the green and rolling the ball well past the hole.</p>
        <p>''The last time I played here, you could stop the ball much quicker on the green,'' Vijay Singh, the reigning Masters champion, said. ''I played with Seve Ballesteros today. He said he has never seen the golf course this hard. I have been putting from 10 or 15 yards off the green. The practice green is almost as hard as concrete. You have to get used to that. If you don't, then you are not going to contend.''</p>
        <p>Snead Reflects</p>
        <p>Sam Snead, who won the 1946 British Open at St. Andrews, played a few holes on the course today.</p>
        <p>''I still love to practice, and at home I play a little,'' said Snead, who is 88 years old.</p>
        <p>After winning in 1946, Snead did not return to defend his title at the 1947 British Open.</p>
        <p>''It cost me $2,000 to come over in 1946, and I won the tournament and got $600,'' Snead said. ''They said, 'You coming back to defend next year?' I said, 'You're kidding.' ''</p>
        <p>A Determined Faldo</p>
        <p>John Daly won the last British Open at St. Andrews in 1995, but Nick Faldo won at St. Andrews in 1990. Faldo, who has begun to regain his form after a lengthy slump, believes he can win again. ''I still have the drive, the enthusiasm and the dedication,'' Faldo said today. ''Maybe it will happen one more time.''</p>
        <p>Faldo won the 1990 British easily, by five strokes over Payne Stewart and Mark McNulty, who tied for second place. Of Faldo's six major championships, the 1990 British Open was one of his finest performances, and just arriving at St. Andrews today brought back fond memories.</p>
        <p>''There's a feel-good factor here,'' Faldo said. ''Things have started to turn around the last couple of months. I think I'm putting the pieces back to the jigsaw of what it takes to win tournaments.''</p>
        <p>Missing the Mark</p>
        <p>Many players on the PGA Tour failed to qualify for the British Open at local qualifiers in Scotland today.</p>
        <p>Those who failed to make the field included Brad Faxon, Len Mattiace, Greg Kraft, Gary Nicklaus, Tom Pernice, Franklin Langham, Harrison Frazar, Glen Day, Rich Beem and Rory Sabbatini.</p>
