        <p>Three days into his trial on charges of grand larceny, a former court clerk pleaded guilty yesterday to stealing the personal diary of Malcolm X from a safe containing evidence in Manhattan State Supreme Court, where he worked.</p>
        <p>The clerk, Douglas Henderson, 41, had already admitted to prosecutors that in 1991 he stole the diary, which the civil rights leader had in his jacket pocket when he was assassinated at a Manhattan ballroom in 1965. But he decided to go to trial anyway in hopes of being cleared.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Henderson, who is a law student, pleaded guilty before Judge Jeffrey M. Atlas in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, swiftly concluding a trial in which two of Malcolm X's daughters were expected to testify today.</p>
        <p>The 146-page diary was first discovered missing from court archives last May, when a private collector in California planned to sell it through the auction house of Butterfield &amp; Butterfield. The mock leather diary, which was bloodstained and bullet-pocked, contained the phone numbers of Malcolm X's friends and a schedule of planned appearances.  One expert at the auction house estimated its sale would bring $50,000.</p>
        <p>The diary had been part of the evidence at the trial of three men who were convicted of assassinating Malcolm X and was supposed to remain in the archives of the case.  When Mr. Henderson stole the diary, he left behind an empty evidence file in the safe marked ''1965 Red Diary with Three Bullet Holes.''</p>
        <p>In January 1997, he sold it to a  dealer, Mark Schafler, for $5,000. After his arrest, Mr. Henderson at first said that he had planned to return it to Malcolm X's family.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henderson, who has long been fascinated with Malcolm X, is now a second-year student at New York Law School. If convicted, he faces seven years in prison.</p>
