        <p>When Sandra Glover graduated from the University of Houston in 1991, she became an elementary school teacher and her hurdling career seemed destined for anonymity.</p>
        <p>After two Olympic trials in which she never threatened to make the American team, however, Glover ran the fastest time in the world this year in the 400-meter hurdles tonight, winning in 53.33 seconds.</p>
        <p>After finishing fifth at the 1999 world championships, she now becomes a favorite to win the gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>In the men's long jump, with the four-time Olympic champion Carl Lewis and the world record-holder Mike Powell retired, the event has slumped into mediocrity. Melvin Lister won tonight with a jump of 27 feet 3 3/4 inches, the shortest winning jump at the Olympic trials since 1980. Lister's jump was the only 27-foot effort of the night. Dwight Phillips took second at 26-8 1/2 and Walter Davis finished third at in 26-7 1/4.</p>
        <p>A day after winning the women's 1,500 meters, Regina Jacobs was the top qualifier in the 5,000-meters preliminaries tonight in 15 minutes 36.09 seconds. She has said that she used the 5,000 only for a training run and will not contest the event in Sydney.</p>
        <p>In the women's 400-meter hurdles, Glover started in Lane 7, not generally a prime lane, but she took control of the race on the final curve. Her winning time was a full two-tenths of a second ahead of the previous world best of 53.53 this year, held by the current world champion, Nezha Bidouane of Morocco.</p>
        <p>Glover defeated the world record-holder, Kim Batten, who was second in 54.70, and Tonja Buford-Bailey, who was third in 54.80. Glover's victory was more remarkable considering that she is coached by her husband, Don, who is a chemical engineer for Phillips Petroleum. When he began coaching his wife six years ago, he knew nothing about the event. By last year, however, Sandra Glover had become the national champion.</p>
        <p>''I didn't do it at 22 or 23, but I'm here and I'm grateful,'' she said. ''Thirty-one years old and running strong.''</p>
        <p>This year, Glover has taken a leave from her teaching job. She and her husband train after he gets off work in the evening. He will also take a leave to prepare for Sydney, he said, adding, ''I hope I have a job when I get back.''</p>
        <p>''I had a full-time job and was training at the same time,'' Sandra Glover said. ''It was hard. After working eight hours with 4- and 5-year-olds, it was tough. ''</p>
        <p>At a news conference tonight, she then looked at Batten, whose world record is 52.61 seconds.</p>
        <p>''Sorry, Kim,'' Glover said, ''but your record is going down this year.''</p>
