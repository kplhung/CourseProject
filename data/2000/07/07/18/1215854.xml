        <p>THERE was a time when the mayor and the biographer were on good terms -- when the biographer is Wayne Barrett, investigative reporter for The Village Voice, heaven forbid anyone call them ''cozy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett had frequent dinners with Rudolph W. Giuliani during his term as United States attorney for the Southern District in the 1980's. Mr. Giuliani was the crime-bashing hero of ''City for Sale,'' the 1988 book Mr. Barrett wrote with Jack Newfield. Mr. Giuliani went to the book party.</p>
        <p>Those days are over.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett's latest book, ''Rudy! An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani'' (Basic Books), hits him hard. Mr. Barrett breaks the news that the mayor's father spent time in Sing Sing and excoriates the mayor for his handling of race relations.</p>
        <p>Did the mayor change, or did Mr. Barrett change?</p>
        <p>''I had blinders on for some aspects of his life,'' says Mr. Barrett, 55. ''I didn't pay enough attention to things he had done before he came back to New York'' under President Reagan. He singles out Mr. Giuliani's role in what he considers the Reagan administration's anti-immigration policy toward Haitians, which led to the detention of thousands of refugees in Florida. ''His conduct in regard to Haiti was deplorable; it was a predicator of his mayoralty and how he's related to the black community. I fault myself for not paying more attention to it.''</p>
        <p>Why didn't he?</p>
        <p>''Well, I identified with him a great deal in some ways. We both did 16 years of Catholic school, we're a year apart in age, we both chased the same bad guys. When he was U.S. attorney, he was fun to be around. There was a kind of electricity. He would think about his mistakes, he had a humanity to him. I'll tell you this: after he entered the political world, I never had another meal with him. I've had meals with politicians, but not one I had bonded with. I wanted to have a sharper demarcation with him when he entered the political world.''</p>
        <p>Wayne Barrett -- he may be sitting in the garden of his house in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, on this hot afternoon, sweating in the suit his wife, Fran, told him to wear (He: ''But what about casual clothes?'' She: ''You don't have any good casual clothes''), charming and open. But in truth, under that suit he wears a cape and is Wayne Barrett, Righteous Reporter.</p>
        <p>Committed? He was so obsessed with meeting the deadline for his book that he did not go home to Lynchburg, Va., last Christmas to visit his ailing father. (His father died three weeks later, and Mr. Barrett has yet to forgive himself.)</p>
        <p>His temper is famous. The word most often used to describe him, however, is ''indefatigable.'' William Bastone, a former Voice intern, recalls a month with Mr. Barrett searching for a source. They tracked their man, finally, to a hospital where he had checked in under an alias.</p>
        <p>''It must be you, Mr. Barrett,'' the man said as they walked into his hospital room.</p>
        <p>IS it a surprise that the reporter with the no-excuses standards had a father with no-excuses standards? Lawrence G. Barrett, nuclear physicist. When Wayne comes in second in a national debating competition, getting to bed at 4:30 a.m. after a late flight, his father rouses him four hours later because no child of his is going to sleep past 8:30 a.m. Nor is Mr. Barrett permitted to date.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett is something of a tough case himself. Decides he wants to be a priest in high school -- ''just like Rudy.'' At the seminary, he lasts half a month.</p>
        <p>''I felt I couldn't be a priest and masturbate,'' Mr. Barrett says. ''I held out for two weeks. Then I packed my bags. One of the priests asked me why I was leaving, and I told him I had committed a mortal sin.''</p>
        <p>The priest, Mr. Barrett says, tells him kindly that it's human nature.</p>
        <p>When he hears that, Mr. Barrett leaves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett is more strict than the priest, he is teased now.</p>
        <p>He does not see the humor.</p>
        <p>''It was the hypocrisy,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Another thing that disturbs Mr. Barrett: Lynchburg was segregated. He recalls the trial of a 16-year-old black man, sentenced to death for raping a white woman. Mr. Barrett's father is a member of the jury, but the case is never discussed at home.</p>
        <p>''My mother said my father used to dream, years later, that I became a prosecutor and I prosecuted him for his role in the case,'' Mr. Barrett says sadly. ''It must have haunted him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett enters St. Joseph's College, in Philadelphia, a Goldwater Republican. By the time he graduates from the Columbia University School of Journalism in 1968, he is radicalized. He spends 15 years in Ocean Hill and Brownsville as schoolteacher and muckraker.</p>
        <p>And he insists that while the mayor has disappointed him, he is not angry at him. ''What's strange is that though most of my journalism is negative, I don't regard it as personal,'' he says. ''Meade Esposito, I wrote stories that led to his resignation as county leader in Brooklyn. He saw me one day, he said'' -- low, gravelly impersonation here -- '' 'Barrett, I don't understand you. I get along with every journalist in this town except you and that' '' -- expletive here -- '' 'Newfield. Tell me why you hate me.' He couldn't believe the stories weren't about why I hated him, but why I opposed him. Finally he wore me down, so I started off, 'Well, Meade, you corrupted an entire judiciary.' ''</p>
        <p>Laughing now.</p>
        <p>''He looked at me and said, 'What else?' He needed to think it was personal.''</p>
