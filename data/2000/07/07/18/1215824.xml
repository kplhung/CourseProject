        <p>From his corner office in Canada Place, a sparkling steel and glass high-rise, the premier of British Columbia has a harbor view of Burrard Inlet, a sheltered patch of sea water framed by mountains, but stained by history.</p>
        <p>Here, in 1914, Canadian officials detained a ship loaded with 376 Punjabi immigrants. After two months at anchor, the ship and almost all its passengers were sent back to India, a reflection of Canadian laws that then excluded virtually all immigrants from India and that denied Indians living here the right to vote, run for office or become lawyers.</p>
        <p>''You can see the spot from here,'' mused the new premier, Ujjal Dosanjh, rising from his chair to inspect the unfamiliar view from his new seventh-floor office. Born a Sikh in a dusty village in Punjab in 1947, the year that India won its independence and that Canada gave long-resident Asians full citizenship including the right to vote, Mr. Dosanjh (pronounced doh-SANJ) is Canada's first nonwhite provincial premier.</p>
        <p>In February, when he campaigned for the leadership of his party, the New Democrats, this soft-spoken man, who taught himself English by listening to BBC radio, told delegates of his childhood, riding ox carts or listening to tales about Gandhi and Nehru from his grandfather. Later, after Mr. Dosanjh was sworn in as premier in the mansion of the queen's representative, the celebration featured samosa pastries and turbaned musicians playing sitars.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Dosanjh's rise to power here was largely ignored in the rest of North America, it was front-page news thousands of miles away. India's newspapers and television gave his election enthusiastic coverage.</p>
        <p>The rise of an Indo-Canadian to the leadership of Canada's third-most-populous province reflects Canada's rapidly changing ethnic nature, as well as its widespread acceptance of diversity.</p>
        <p>In another measure of Canada's embrace of Asian immigrants, Adrienne Clarkson, an ethnic Chinese refugee from World War II Hong Kong, became Canada's governor general, or head of state, last year.</p>
        <p>''Eastern Canada's two founding peoples may be the English and the French,'' said Peter C. Newman, an author and journalist who lives on a boat here. ''Well, in Vancouver the two founding nations are now the Indians and the Chinese.''</p>
        <p>News media attention has traditionally focused on the 350,000 ethnic Chinese living in this province, sometimes giving this city the nickname ''Hong-couver.'' But the province's 250,000 Indo-Canadians are increasingly visible as a political and economic force and are rapidly entering the Canadian mainstream.</p>
        <p>Examples abound. Ian Hanomansing, a 38-year-old Indo-Canadian reporter for CBC television, is being groomed to become the network's national news anchor. Baltej Dhillon has become the first Mountie allowed to wear a turban. A 17-year-old Indo-Canadian girl from Ontario will lead the nation's high school debating team next winter. And an Indo-Canadian novelist from Montreal recently won a British Commonwealth book prize for the Americas.</p>
        <p>In Toronto at the Royal Ontario Museum, an establishment arbiter of culture, crowds are flocking this summer to a new show, ''The Arts of the Sikh Kingdoms.'' And in Ontario a leadership candidate for the nation's largest conservative party, the Canadian Alliance, was photographed wearing a Sikh head covering as he sought votes in a temple.</p>
        <p>Most of Canada's roughly half a million residents of Indian origin are Sikhs, a religious group centered in Punjab, a landlocked northern state near Pakistan, where people traditionally excel as farmers and entrepreneurs. As links grow, Punjabi state ministers regularly visit here, and in September, Mr. Dosanjh is to lead a British Columbia trade mission to his birth state.</p>
        <p>''Vancouver is now a fund-raising stop for anyone who wants to get elected to anything in Punjab,'' said Kim Boland, a reporter for The Vancouver Sun who covers the Punjabis.</p>
        <p>North America's history is marked by a succession of ethnic breakthroughs. But in the United States, ethnic groups usually find refuge in one political party and ride that party to power.</p>
        <p>British Columbia's Sikhs, on the other hand, have brought from India, the world's most populous democracy, an addiction to competitive politics that drives them into different camps. In Canada's House of Commons there are now five Indo-Canadian members, including Gurbas Malhi, an Ontario Liberal who bills himself ''the first turban Sikh elected in North America.'' The other Liberal Sikh, Herb Dhaliwal of Vancouver, is federal minister of fisheries and oceans. The other Sikh members of Parliament are from the Canadian Alliance, the official opposition.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Dosanjh's leadership race, news analysts complained that in the weeks before the vote, the New Democratic Party became stacked with Sikhs; party membership rose by 75 percent in just three months, to 24,000. About 3,000 of the new members turned out also to be members of the Liberal Party, who had joined the New Democrats apparently to help the two Sikh candidates.</p>
        <p>On voting day, about a quarter of the delegates were Sikhs, some sporting buttons written in Punjabi, ''I am not a Liberal.'' But they were split between the Sikh candidates: Mr. Dosanjh, then attorney general, and Moe Sihota, another provincial minister.</p>
        <p>''There are Sikhs in Reform, Liberal, Conservative and N.D.P., but it is wrong for people to join more than one party,'' said Dave S. Hayer, a Punjabi newspaper publisher who is running for the Liberal nomination in Surrey-Tynehead, a new provincial assembly district created to accommodate the huge inflow of Sikh immigrants here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hayer incarnates the Sikhs' two most salient faces -- a concerted push into the establishment, and a taste for political battle that sometimes veers into violence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hayer, who has just completed his term as the first Indo-Canadian president of the local Rotary Club, is assistant publisher of The Indo-Canadian Times, North America's largest Punjabi newspaper. The job fell into his hands after his father, Tara Singh Hayer, was shot to death in his wheelchair on Nov. 18, 1998. The police have identified as a suspect a 39-year-old trucker who leads a Sikh temple in Alberta.</p>
        <p>Tara Hayer's killing is a sequel to the political radicalization that split the Sikh diaspora after Indian troops occupied their holy site, the Golden Temple in Amritsar, in 1984. The next year, an Air India plane from Canada blew up off Ireland, killing all 329 people aboard.</p>
        <p>The Mounties have said suitcase bombs sent from Vancouver had destroyed the Air India plane near Ireland, as well as another Air India plane damaged the same day at Narita Airport in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>Around the same time, a Sikh radical attacked Mr. Dosanjh, one of the few Sikh moderates who dared to speak openly against extremism. Attacked with an iron rod, Mr. Dosanjh suffered a broken hand as he tried to defend himself, and he needed 80 stitches for his head wounds.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Dosanjh and others believe that the radicalism has ebbed. In hard-fought elections, moderates have won control of Vancouver's largest temples. The provincial government is curbing ''community development'' grants that once were channeled to radical Sikh temples. And the federal government is moving to curb Punjabi hate-radio transmissions that have been broadcast to Vancouver from Washington State. Journalists who follow Canada's 15-year-old investigation into the Air India bombing predict that charges will be filed this fall against a group of Vancouver-based Sikhs.</p>
        <p>As the popular image of Sikh violence ebbs, the election of Mr. Dosanjh came about with little discussion of race, a far cry from the days 85 years ago when Vancouver published headlines like, ''Hindu Invasion of Canada.''</p>
        <p>After three months on the job, Mr. Dosanjh won a 64 percent approval rating from provincial voters polled by the Angus Reid Group, Inc. He was far more popular than his party, the New Democrats, which had only a 16 percent approval rating.</p>
        <p>''It is a real tribute to British Columbia that we have accepted diversity as much as we have,'' Mr. Dosanjh said in his new office. ''My approval rating tells me that people don't see color.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 22, 2000, Saturday  An article on Tuesday about the growing prominence of Sikhs in British Columbia and Canada's acceptance of diversity referred incorrectly to Adrienne Clarkson, an immigrant from Hong Kong who is the governor general. She is not Canada's head of state; Queen Elizabeth II is.</p>
        <p>The article also referred incorrectly to a trade mission to India by Ujjal Dosanjh, an Indian-born Sikh who is British Columbia's premier. While such a mission has been discussed, there are no plans for one in September.</p>
        <p>The article also misspelled the surname of a reporter for The Vancouver Sun who commented on the growing links between Indians in Vancouver and in the state of Punjab. She is Kim Bolan, not Boland.</p>
