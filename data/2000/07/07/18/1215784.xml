        <p>Few consider headbanging a graceful form of human expression. The rhythmic back-and-forth motion, in time to bone-shaking hard rock, epitomizes heavy metal's primitive charm. Headbangers, those who regularly indulge in this perception-addling activity, can claim enthusiasm but are rarely given credit for smarts. Yet the Queens of the Stone Age show at Bowery Ballroom on Saturday night stimulated headbanging of the most refined variety.</p>
        <p>Queens of the Stone Age, taking a night off from the Ozzfest tour that stops at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., on Monday, used the confines of a small club to stretch the dynamics of its increasingly thorny sound. The band could be called a boutique metal band; although tours like Ozzfest put it in arenas, its experimental approach to the genre's eternal preoccupations make it a band preferred by critics and a loyal cult. With all the pyrotechnics in the music, Queens of the Stone Age invite listeners to return to the sources of pleasure in heavy metal: distortion and space.</p>

        <p>Queens of the Stone Age, taking a night off from the Ozzfest tour that stops at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., on Monday, used the confines of a small club to stretch the dynamics of its increasingly thorny sound. The band could be called a boutique metal band; although tours like Ozzfest put it in arenas, its experimental approach to the genre's eternal preoccupations make it a band preferred by critics and a loyal cult. With all the pyrotechnics in the music, Queens of the Stone Age invite listeners to return to the sources of pleasure in heavy metal: distortion and space.</p>
        <p>The first was obvious. Since the reign of Jimi Hendrix, a clear influence on the Queens of the Stone Age guitarist, Joshua Homme, metal guitarists have bent strings, beaten fingerboards and pounded pedals to get their instruments to utter strange divinations. In Queens of the Stone Age the distortion is increased by the addition of pedal steel, but Mr. Homme's playing remained the focus on Saturday. He displayed the most unlikely quality: tastefulness. Spare solos only sometimes erupted into the climaxes one expects from a metal god. Mostly Mr. Homme toyed with choppy riffing or sinuous cadences, encouraging an introspective mood.</p>
        <p>His self-control, complemented by the resolute accuracy of the bassist, Nick Oliveri, and the drummer, Gene Troutmann, allowed for the crucial and uncommon element of sonic distance. This is not to say the music avoided the impact needed to stimulate headbanging.</p>
        <p>Queens of the Stone Age were punkishly loud at times, slipping into Chocolate Watchband-style garage psychedelia on ''Ode To Clarissa'' and backroom dramatics recalling the great Misfits on ''Leg of Lamb.'' Mr. Oliveri's occasional vocals were all about screeching and posturing.</p>
        <p>But whether hitting quick and dirty or stretching out, Queens of the Stone Age left gaps between each riff's turn and solo's reach. Sometimes these openings were nearly imperceptible. But crucially they allowed for a moment's thought that the music might go in a different direction.</p>
        <p>One wondered if Mr. Homme's seductive vocals, mostly describing mysterious interpersonal encounters, might leap out of the minor key, or whether Mr. Troutmann's drumming would spin in a new direction.</p>
        <p>This persistent sense of implicit change made the music a real head game. The band had the brawn heavy metal requires but wielded it with the precision of the Marquis de Sade. As comically broad as the genre can sometimes be, Queens of the Stone Age showed that its fierce noise can also be surprisingly delicate.</p>
