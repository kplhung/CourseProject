        <p>De Beers Consolidated Mines, the South African diamond giant, is finding unexpectedly tough resistance to its expansion into a potentially lucrative property in the Canadian north.</p>
        <p>De Beers is thought likely to eventually gain control of its first North American diamond mine by purchasing Winspear Diamonds, a small Vancouver-based company. Winspear owns a site at Snap Lake, about 150 miles northeast of Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories that it calls one of the richest undeveloped diamond properties in the world. It is putting up a fight that could make success for De Beers more expensive than the big company envisioned.</p>
        <p>Canadian diamonds are regarded as especially important to De Beers now because it is trying to avoid marketing diamonds mined in African war zones. Last week, it pledged not to trade with companies that profit from diamonds used to finance such conflicts.</p>
        <p>On June 26, De Beers offered 259 million Canadian dollars, or roughly $175 million, for Winspear. Although that was a 77 percent premium to the price of Winspear's shares in Toronto trading, its board called the offer opportunistic and inadequate.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Winspear moved to back up that contention, saying that under new projections the size of its ore reserves had tripled and the potential rate of production would double.</p>
        <p>That sounded implausible to De Beers, particularly since Winspear based the new projections on drilling information not disclosed in a prospectus to shareholders a month earlier. De Beers officials called the projections an attempt to thwart its takeover offer.</p>
        <p>''No reserve has yet been defined on the Snap Lake property,'' said Richard Molyneaux, president of De Beers Canada. He said excavation of the ore on the Winspear property ''at a relatively low depth, under a lake, has not been undertaken anywhere in the world, and brings with it a number of significant risks.''</p>
        <p>Today, Winspear's chief executive, Randy Turner, formally rejected De Beers' price, and said Winspear had been approached by other companies, which could lead to a higher offer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner said the new projections put the value of the Snap Lake property at 1.35 billion Canadian dollars, or more than $900 million, and that previous assessments made the property worth at least 500 million Canadian dollars -- almost twice what De Beers had offered.</p>
        <p>Half of the world's production of new diamonds comes from De Beers, and two-thirds of the gems sold go through its distribution system. The company missed out on early exploration in Canada, but has become more determined since Mr. Molyneaux, an experienced mine operator in South Africa, arrived early this year. De Beers gets 35 percent of the output from the Ekati mine in the Northwest Territories, but has no operation of its own.</p>
