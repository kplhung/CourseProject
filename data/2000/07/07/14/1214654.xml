        <p>THE NAME OF THE WORLD  By Denis Johnson  129 pages. HarperCollins. $22.</p>
        <p>There are a yellowed globe and an antique telescope in the living room of Ted MacKey, the chairman of the music department at a Midwestern college. They are elements of a mellow scholarly decor in which the guests sip hot buttered rum by a blazing log fire. It is Currier &amp; Ives does academe, or, as Michael, an adjunct professor and the shattered narrator, remarks in ''The Name of the World,'' ''a very expensive gift shop.''</p>
        <p>It is a fine, acid phrase. The decor comes in more suggestively in Michael's comment about some of his older colleagues regularly dusting off ''the lectures they'd been dragging out . . . since the days when Ted MacKey's big beige globe had known what it was talking about.''</p>
        <p>In Denis Johnson's fiction, the world no longer knows what it is talking about, and its denizens' heads are filled with babble. It and they are fragmented, though the fragmentation varies from book to book. It is an outright post-apocalyptic vision in ''Fiskadoro,'' his finest work. Fragmentation is intricate social and personal disarray in the charming if doleful picaresque of ''Resuscitation of a Hanged Man,'' underrated when it appeared.</p>
        <p>In ''Angels'' and ''Jesus' Son,'' it is young Americans drugging and drifting; in the much weaker ''Stars at Noon,'' young drugs-and-drifts meet a chilling, C.I.A.-backed repression in Central America. In ''Already Dead,'' declaredly gothic, the writing itself is fragmented, as if the writer had been abducted and blown up, with shards of character, vision, pith and coherence drifting down together.</p>
        <p>The novella-length ''Name of the World'' is also shards, though better ones, and for a while they hold a promise of reassembling, until the author relinquishes them in a swirl of visionary cloud. The writing gives way to poetic curdle.</p>
        <p>The fragmenting event is specific, and mournfully promising: two deaths. Michael, a onetime high school teacher who became the aide to a senator from his state, had spent a dozen years as a Washington insider. (This occupies a page or two; it is a bit of glib telescoping, like affixing a mask stamped ''King,'' but it is nothing compared to the arbitrary sped-up dizziness at the end.) Michael loses his wife and daughter in a car crash for which he blames himself. He loses himself, as well; his protracted mourning and disorientation play out in the refuge his connections obtain for him: a temporary, year-by-year contract to conduct a vague seminar in history. It is, he admits, a vacation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson creates a few sharp academic scenes. At a dinner party, a visiting novelist puts down a brash young instructor who complains that his characters are ''morally uninstructive.'' The sardonically (perhaps self-mockingly) deconstructive retort: ''Do you really hope to get your moral lessons from people who don't exist?''</p>
        <p>In another scene, Michael attends a faculty party, only to learn it is to bid him farewell. As someone who hates confrontation, his department head had neglected to tell him his contract would not be renewed. Michael recalls confrontation-happy Washington. A campaign manager calls in an aide. ''Do you want to know how a loser stinks?'' she asks. ''Put your nose in your armpit. Then empty your desk.''</p>
        <p>For the most part, Johnson scants external circumstances in favor of internal states of spirit. Incidents and characters get a dab of treatment, sometimes quite promising, and are relinquished. The narration is a series of chronological twitches, as if trying to shake itself off. In ''Resuscitation of a Hanged Man,'' Lenny, the protagonist, was vividly present, even as the world revolved cloudily in eccentric orbit around him. Here Michael is sucked into the orbit; we see him only erratically.</p>
        <p>What we do see, though, and it is the strongest part of the book, is his grief. Mr. Johnson renders it with two images. One is the round campus pond, frozen in winter, where skaters circle endlessly. Watching them, Michael's obsessive circling of his own tragedy plays out.</p>
        <p>The image is replaced by a stronger one. He sees a drawing by an amateur painter: a series of concentric rectangles. The innermost is imperfect, the second imperfectly reproduces the imperfection, the third magnifies the mistakes of the first two and so on, until the outer figure is a grotesque distortion of the original.</p>
        <p>It is a metaphor, beautifully conceived, for the falsity of excessively protracted mourning. The beginning of Michael's deliverance comes in a phrase: he is ''less the man who'd lost his family, and more just somebody who didn't happen to have one.''</p>
        <p>The deliverance buries the book. Deliverance starts with an art student who calls herself Flower. Michael sees her in a performance piece, shaving her pudendum. He meets her when she is serving at a cocktail party, and she recognizes him. He sees her winning a striptease contest in a bar. It is not the nudity, mainly, that arouses him, nor is the arousing mainly physical. Johnson conveys the witchery of sexual attraction and transforms it into the life-restoring inklings of love.</p>
        <p>So far so good. But then Flower performs a bewildering series of transformations. Michael meets her at a Mennonite-style church service, goes to the deserted schoolhouse where she lives, is led through various rituals that seem to summon up the ghost of his dead daughter. He begins to make love to her, then breaks off, flees and never sees her again. It is all arbitrary and gestural, a necromancy that is incantation and very little magic.</p>
        <p>Michael goes to Alaska, to Greece (a couple of paragraphs for each), becomes a freelance journalist, covers the Persian Gulf war. The writing gets wilder and emptier:</p>
        <p>''I remain a student of history, more of one than ever, now that our century has torn its way out of its chrysalis and become too beautiful to be examined, too alive to be debated and exploited by played-out intellectuals. The important thing is no longer to predict in what way its grand convulsions might next shake us.  Now the important thing is to ride it into the sky.''</p>
        <p>Sky-riding is announced, but ''The Name of the World'' fails to provide a serviceable horse of any kind, let alone winged.</p>
