        <p>Coach Jeff Van Gundy and General Manager Scott Layden were nowhere to be found at the Knicks' rookie camp today. They were continuing their courtship of the power forward Brian Grant as they cruised around Westchester County and the surrounding areas in a limousine.</p>
        <p>Last year's first-round pick, Frederic Weis, was not at camp either as the Knicks awaited word on when he might arrive.</p>
        <p>But it was not an idle day at the Fairfield University gym. Behind closed doors, Lavor Postell and Pete Mickeal, the Knicks' two second-round draft picks, toiled for the benefit of the team's assistant coaches as they tried to outwork all of the long shots gathered at the camp.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Grant and his wife, Gina, were romanced not only by Van Gundy, Layden and Steve Mills, the vice president for franchise operations, but also by real estate agents. They were driven by Larry Johnson's stately home and then treated to dinner aboard a yacht owned by James L. Dolan, president and chief executive officer of Cablevision, which owns the Knicks.</p>
        <p>Postell and Mickeal, however, were treated to the icy stare of the assistant coaches who watched their every move.</p>
        <p>Being picked in the second round gives a player no guarantees and no more security than the other players at camp. But the two players have caught the eyes of the coaching staff. While Postell was overshadowed at St. John's by more heralded players such as Erick Barkley and Ron Artest, and Mickeal operated in the shadow of Kenyon Martin at Cincinnati, both were respected for their work ethic and leadership. And both players believe their hard work will be appreciated by the Knicks' coaching staff.</p>
        <p>''It's appreciated with the coaches,'' said Mickeal, adding that Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins ''will tell you to this day, I was the heart and soul of that team.''</p>
        <p>''There's just no doubt about it,'' he added. ''I always do the dirty work, the intangible things. I've always guarded the best guy.  A lot of guys get a lot more attention than me, but I never looked at that as a bad thing. My friends did and they'd tell me, 'Kenyon's on highlights again and you're not.' It's just one of those things.''</p>
        <p>Postell and Mickeal impressed not only the coaches, but also Rick Brunson, the lone player from last year's roster at the camp. Brunson noted that in Postell he saw a player with the ability and the toughness to play in the National Basketball Association.</p>
        <p>''Right now, they haven't seen nothing yet,'' said Postell, who is making the switch from forward to shooting guard. ''I'm still breaking in, getting used to practice and the workouts. Give me another day or so. I'm on another level now, but it's going to be amazing in a couple more days.''</p>
        <p>Brendan Malone, a Knicks assistant, said: ''With Lavor and Pete, we told them both that they don't have to impress us with their offense. Impress us with your defense and your team play, and let shots come to you. They were hunting out shots last night. I talked to both of those guys this morning and Lavor said: 'That was my rookie day. I'm not a rookie anymore.' So he got the message.''</p>
        <p>Waiting after practice with the other players to board a bus back to the hotel, only to rest up for the second workout of the day, it was not hard for the players to maintain the hunger that got them this far.</p>
        <p>Away from their lofty status in college, they could see other players around them who have tried for years to find their way onto an N.B.A. roster.</p>
        <p>''That would be the worst scenario,'' Mickeal said of not making the team.  ''That's always in the back of my mind. I always said, just be around me a week and you'll get the real feel of how I am. Now they've been around me for a week so they're getting the feel.''</p>
