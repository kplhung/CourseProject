        <p>More than 25 years after the fall of Saigon, the United States signed a broad trade agreement yesterday with Vietnam. The accord pledges further opening of the Vietnamese economy and permits American companies there to compete on a more equal footing with other foreign businesses. Its signing marks another welcome step toward healing the wounds of a bitter and divisive war.</p>
        <p>Vietnam has been opening its markets for more than a decade. But foreign companies operating there have been discouraged by burdensome and costly bureaucratic interference. American companies entered the Vietnamese market after the two countries established normal diplomatic relations in 1995. But with their late start and the absence, until now, of a trade agreement, American concerns have been at a disadvantage. The United States ranks only ninth among countries investing in Vietnam, and trade between the two countries is a disappointingly small $1 billion a year.</p>

        <p>More than 25 years after the fall of Saigon, the United States signed a broad trade agreement yesterday with Vietnam. The accord pledges further opening of the Vietnamese economy and permits American companies there to compete on a more equal footing with other foreign businesses. Its signing marks another welcome step toward healing the wounds of a bitter and divisive war.</p>
        <p>Vietnam has been opening its markets for more than a decade. But foreign companies operating there have been discouraged by burdensome and costly bureaucratic interference. American companies entered the Vietnamese market after the two countries established normal diplomatic relations in 1995. But with their late start and the absence, until now, of a trade agreement, American concerns have been at a disadvantage. The United States ranks only ninth among countries investing in Vietnam, and trade between the two countries is a disappointingly small $1 billion a year.</p>
        <p>The new trade agreement, which still must be approved by Congress, could change that picture significantly. High-growth industries like telecommunications will be opened to freer competition. American tariffs on goods manufactured in Vietnam will be sharply reduced, permitting American companies there to produce for export to the United States market. From the Vietnamese side, the agreement represents a recognition that market reforms must go forward if Vietnam is to compete effectively with China for foreign investment.</p>
        <p>Politically, Vietnam remains a repressive Communist dictatorship. Intellectuals calling for more democracy face isolation and house arrest, Buddhist leaders are harassed, senior Communists pressing for faster reforms face persecution. Washington rightly made progress on refugee issues and finding the remains of missing American combatants conditions for signing the trade agreement.  With America now likely to play a larger economic role in Vietnam, Washington should raise its voice on behalf of persecuted Vietnamese democrats.</p>
