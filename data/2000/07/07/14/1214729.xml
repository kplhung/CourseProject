      <abstract>
        <p>Marci A Hamilton Op-Ed article opposes bill in Congress to forbid local governments from applying zoning and other land-use laws to houses of worship unless the law is narrowly tailored and there is a compelling interest in applying it; says measure would grant special privileges to religious construction, allowing houses of worship to evade local laws that have been passed for valid reasons and that everyone else in the community must obey; says this would violate First Amendment (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Some innocent-sounding legislation proposed in Congress would, if it were passed, have the real effect of attacking the First Amendment's directive that ''Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.'' Billed as an attempt to preserve religious liberty, this proposed law on ''religious land use'' would actually grant special privileges to religious construction, allowing houses of worship to evade local laws that have been passed for valid reasons and that everyone else in the community must obey.</p>
        <p>The bill, which has bipartisan support, would forbid governments from applying any land-use law to houses of worship unless the law was narrowly tailored and there was a compelling interest in applying it. It is the offspring of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in 1997. That law permitted religious individuals and entities to challenge every law in the country in federal court. This one has the virtue of narrowing the focus, but its flaw is the same one the broader measure had: it gives religion a special privilege against generally applicable laws. If it were passed, this new law, too, would be unlikely to survive constitutional challenge. But while it was in force, it could only hurt relations between religious congregations and their neighbors.</p>

        <p>The bill, which has bipartisan support, would forbid governments from applying any land-use law to houses of worship unless the law was narrowly tailored and there was a compelling interest in applying it. It is the offspring of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in 1997. That law permitted religious individuals and entities to challenge every law in the country in federal court. This one has the virtue of narrowing the focus, but its flaw is the same one the broader measure had: it gives religion a special privilege against generally applicable laws. If it were passed, this new law, too, would be unlikely to survive constitutional challenge. But while it was in force, it could only hurt relations between religious congregations and their neighbors.</p>
        <p>Zoning and other land-use laws ensure that residential neighborhoods will remain comfortable places to live. This bill could be expected to let religious groups buy lots, raze houses and build large parking lots without regard to the rules. They could put up steeples, telephone towers or other structures taller than the local ordinances allowed. They could evade rules on lot size or building size. They could fight tree ordinances, drainage requirements and the parking restrictions used in many communities to ease traffic congestion. They could challenge sign and lighting regulations or noise limits; imagine, for example, spotlights or loudspeakers left on all night next to residences.</p>
        <p>The houses of worship might not win every dispute, of course, but the Senate bill would allow them to resist any attempt at local law enforcement in federal courts. And the courts would be required to give religious entities favored treatment.</p>
        <p>It is important to remember that many houses of worship are no longer sedate, unobtrusive neighbors. Some are huge megachurches or temples open every day for activities that extend far beyond worship; some encompass theaters, coffeehouses, child care and senior centers, and fitness facilities. These may be wonderful community assets, but shouldn't they go by the same rules as activity centers built by other groups?</p>
        <p>Good land-use laws, like good fences, make good neighbors. To exempt religious groups from obeying is not a protection of religion, but a granting of power to religious entities at the cost of all their neighbors.</p>
