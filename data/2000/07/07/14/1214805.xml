        <p>A wall and two floors collapsed yesterday at an architectural salvage shop in the East Village whose showrooms were loaded with cast-iron fireplaces, Victorian bathtubs, original porcelain New York street signs and Tiffany windows. The damage left the building listing dangerously, forcing the evacuation of 51 apartments in three nearby buildings and leading the city to begin an emergency demolition.</p>
        <p>The partial collapse shortly after 1 p.m. tore a three-story hole in the south wall of the building at Second Avenue and Houston Street. A construction crew was making alterations to the first floor of the four-story shop, Irreplaceable Artifacts, in defiance of an order to stop work, a spokesman for the city's Buildings Department said.</p>
        <p>City officials ordered the building destroyed, along with everything inside -- including several Tiffany windows valued at $50,000 each and a walnut ceiling from William Randolph Hearst's collection. Evan Blum, the owner of Irreplaceable Artifacts, salvages fixtures from demolished buildings and refurbishes them. The collection was worth millions of dollars, Mr. Blum said.</p>
        <p>The collapse came two days after a building exploded in Brooklyn, killing three people. The explosion, believed to have been caused by a natural gas leak, destroyed two town houses in the Boerum Hill section on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>In yesterday's collapse, nine men and two women suffered minor injuries, the police said. One man was taken to the hospital, where he was expected to be treated and released. F train service between West Fourth Street and Jay Street was disrupted for about an hour. The F train continued to skip the Second Avenue stop late into the night.</p>
        <p>Firefighters estimated that more than 100 people were shut out of their apartments. Virginia Mewborn of the Red Cross, which will feed and house the evacuated residents, said some were so frightened that the agency had called in mental health counselors. ''What their idea of a building collapse is right now is what happened in Brooklyn,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blum had been planning to capitalize on the trendy night life on the Lower East Side by opening a restaurant that would face his courtyard on Houston Street. This spring, workers had begun to punch arched doorways into  the brick wall without a permit, said Richard C. Visconti, the acting commissioner of the Buildings Department.</p>
        <p>On May 3, Mr. Visconti said, the department ordered a halt to construction and issued a $2,500 fine, which he said had not been paid. But this week, the department approved a proposal to alter the building, Mr. Visconti said, though no permits had been issued. The architect of record on the plans was the building's owner, Walter Blum, who is Evan Blum's father, Mr. Visconti said.</p>
        <p>Andrzej Przytkla, a bricklayer who was working in the building, said that before the collapse, he and other workers were replacing bricks in a weak wall.</p>
        <p>Walter Blum said the workers were making minor repairs that did not require a permit, and attributed the collapse to the building's age. ''The building is 125 years old,'' he said. ''You get to 125, how are you going to feel? You are going to collapse.''</p>
        <p>Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, who represents the neighborhood,  complained that the Buildings Department allowed architects and engineers to ''self-certify'' that their plans were safe, and that city inspectors did not visit the site before approving plans.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Visconti said the proposal to alter the building was not submitted under the self-certification process, which is optional. Instead, he said, under a process called controlled inspection, the department delegated the responsibility for inspecting critical elements like foundations and reinforcements to a licensed architect or engineer. The inspector can be the same architect or engineer who drew up the plans.</p>
        <p>He said that no city inspectors visited the building before the plans submitted this week were approved.</p>
        <p>The younger Mr. Blum is known as a pioneer in the field of architectural salvage, and he has provided antique fixtures for many movies and shows, including ''Sophie's Choice'' and ''Sex and the City.''</p>
        <p>''It's ironic,'' said Ralph Stevens, a cousin. ''Evan spends his whole life saving items from buildings that were going to be demolished.''</p>
        <p>Kathleen Mahoney, a friend, said Mr. Blum scored a coup early in his career by rescuing the roof cornices from New York's Commodore Hotel when it was stripped in the late 70's to make way for the Grand Hyatt. She said he would never be able to replace what he lost. ''You can't get a collection together like this now because of landmark preservation,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Evan Blum returned from a buying trip in Massachusetts in time to watch the demolition crew dislodge bricks from the edges of the hole using a crane. He said the city was acting too quickly. ''They are overreacting. I think the building can be shored up,'' he said.</p>
        <p>John Simoni, his lawyer, said, ''We begged and pleaded with the building department to see if we could at least get some of the contents out.''</p>
        <p>But officials said the building was too dangerous to enter. Because the south wall was a load-bearing wall, the damage started what was essentially a slow-motion collapse. The north wall of the building was listing a half-inch to the south and gaps had opened in the mortar of the elevator shaft, Mr. Visconti said.</p>
        <p>George J. Wasielke, an insurance adjuster representing Walter Blum, estimated that the 1865 building was worth more than $1 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stevens watched a firefighter in a bucket try to coax two cats out of the building. Delicate panes of stained glass were visible through the front windows.</p>
        <p>''That's a Tiffany window!'' he shouted, and rushed over to beseech the firefighters to save the building.</p>
        <p>To no avail. Workers used a crane with a giant clamshell to remove gargoyles and a cast-iron lamppost from the roof and put them in the courtyard. By 8 p.m., the clamshell was chewing on chunks of roof and brick, widening the hole in the building while a crowd cheered.</p>
