        <p>During President Clinton's seven years in office, no world leader has journeyed more often to the White House than Yasir Arafat.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian leader has met Mr. Clinton there a dozen times, and his image in Washington -- sitting in a high-backed chair in the Oval Office, speaking in Arabic on the White House driveway -- has become almost commonplace. In turn, Mr. Clinton made the risky gesture of being the first American president to visit Mr. Arafat on his home turf in Gaza.</p>
        <p>In the coming days, as the Camp David summit meeting proceeds, the White House will see whether that investment can be made to pay in a peace settlement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton believes that personalities and relationships can fundamentally alter history. According to his aides, he is banking on his affinity with Mr. Arafat, and with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, to make a crucial difference at Camp David.</p>
        <p>The success of the summit meeting could well depend, they say, on whether the president's personal chemistry can help overcome obstacles of history and the calculus of political survival embedded in these high-stake negotiations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, his aides like to point out, has come wholly prepared on substance -- so much so that he joked the other night that he could draw a map of the West Bank in his sleep. He has prepped himself with new briefing books that give the latest positions of both sides, and pored over historical records from President Carter's Camp David summit meeting on the art of negotiation.</p>
        <p>That Camp David meeting in 1978 set a tone of informality, which this one is trying to emulate, but so far neither Mr. Barak nor Mr. Arafat has yet been spotted riding a golf cart, the favored mode of transport there, with the president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton greeted Mr. Arafat warmly on their first morning together, and asked whether his accommodation was to his liking. ''I hope you are comfortable,'' Mr. Clinton was reported by one of his aides to have said of Birch cabin assigned to the Palestinian leader. ''You are staying in the cabin where my mother used to stay.''</p>
        <p>Pleasantries aside, the relationship between Mr. Arafat and Mr. Clinton took on a new significance as the summit meeting got under way.</p>
        <p>Faced with an Israeli prime minister who was likely to argue that he needed concessions because of his political fragility at home, Mr. Arafat was viewed as sure to stiffen his resolve not to cave in to Israeli demands, a senior Clinton administration official said.</p>
        <p>''I suspect it raises his level of concern that he will be the one asked to produce,'' the official said in describing Mr. Arafat's reaction to Mr. Barak's narrow victory against a no-confidence vote in the Israeli Parliament.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton would underscore that Mr. Barak was ''taking the political heat because of the positions he was prepared to take,'' and therefore was the best Israeli leader Mr. Arafat could hope for.</p>
        <p>The connection between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Arafat has grown over time, to the point where there is considerable warmth, trust and candor though hardly chumminess, say those who have watched it. ''Arafat is not an easy guy to understand because of who he is and where he has been,'' one of Mr. Clinton's aides said.</p>
        <p>But gradually, their relationship has solidified. The turning point was the peace conference at Wye, Md., in 1998, when Mr. Clinton stood up for Mr. Arafat against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, according to several participants.</p>
        <p>On one occasion at Wye, Mr. Netanyahu said something that was heard as insulting to Mr. Arafat. Mr. Clinton got up from his chair, walked away and then returned, saying, in effect, to the Israeli, ''I'm not going to tolerate this,'' a senior administration official said.</p>
        <p>After the Wye conference, Mr. Clinton agreed to go to Gaza, where he spoke to the Palestinian leadership about removing the idea of Israel's destruction from their charter. That trip cemented the link, aides said.</p>
        <p>''I said to Arafat, 'Did you believe the American president would visit the Middle East and the only one he would see was the leader of the Palestinians?' '' said another senior administration official. ''The look on Arafat's face meant how far he had come in his relations with an American president.''</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. Clinton's relationship with Mr. Barak is freshly minted.</p>
        <p>They first met nearly a year ago, when the newly elected prime minister came to Washington for a get-to-know-you session. They knew each other from mutual colleagues; some of Mr. Clinton's political advisers and pollsters advised Mr. Barak on his successful campaign to convert himself from soldier to prime minister.</p>
        <p>The president showed the prime minister an unusual courtesy -- a night at Camp David. According to an account by Mr. Clinton, they hit it off, talking about politics and war and their mutual respect for Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister who was assassinated in 1995.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton will probably use this relationship with Mr. Barak in a different way from his dealings with Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>After initial hesitation about the need for a strong American role in striking an agreement with the Palestinians, Mr. Barak has swung the other way. At a meeting in Madrid last month with Mr. Clinton, followed by frequent phone contact, the Israeli prime minister lobbied hard for this meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, according to his aides, has come to the conclusion that despite Mr. Clinton's lame-duck status, this was the moment to shoot for an accord with the Palestinians, an accord that Mr. Barak says he was elected to make. Mr. Barak did not want to wait for another administration and, therefore, another year before new officials in Washington were up-to-speed on the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Moreover, this is one of the few areas in which Mr. Clinton's remaining months in office creates no particular disadvantage. His power as a mediator starts with the United States' unique position as the only nation that could possibly convene these talks.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Clinton's chores will be to convince Mr. Barak that even in a weakened political situation, ''an extremely painful deal is better than no deal,'' an experienced Middle East negotiator said.</p>
        <p>By some calculations, Mr. Barak, having put his political life on the line over a peace deal with Mr. Arafat, cannot go home without one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton might add to his argument by pointing out that he had faced extraordinary personal and political crises during his second term, and had survived by staying the course, the negotiator said.</p>
        <p>In the end, the personal relationships that Mr. Clinton has established may be important but not enough to seal a deal. ''If, at the core, the political will is not there, it's difficult to come up with the kind of creative fixes needed,'' one of Mr. Clinton's aides said.</p>
        <p>And the former United States ambassador to Israel, Samuel W. Lewis, who urged Mr. Clinton to call the summit meeting, noted that personal chemistry did not count for a lot at President Carter's Camp David meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis, who was there, said Mr. Carter had an empathetic relationship with the Egyptian leader, Anwar el-Sadat, who most wanted the deal. The Israeli prime minister, Menachem Begin, was finally brought around.</p>
        <p>But during the entire 13 days, Mr. Lewis recalled, the Israeli remained aloof and difficult.</p>
