        <p>A city lawyer said yesterday that the Giuliani administration would appeal a state judge's ruling that continuing mental health care must be arranged for inmates before they are released from Rikers Island and other jails.</p>
        <p>The lawyer, Leonard Koerner, said the city did not have a plan in place for complying with the judge's ruling. ''The judge hasn't refined what it would take,'' he said. ''It's one thing for the city to formulate a plan without court compulsion, and it's another thing to be compelled to do it.''</p>

        <p>A city lawyer said yesterday that the Giuliani administration would appeal a state judge's ruling that continuing mental health care must be arranged for inmates before they are released from Rikers Island and other jails.</p>
        <p>The lawyer, Leonard Koerner, said the city did not have a plan in place for complying with the judge's ruling. ''The judge hasn't refined what it would take,'' he said. ''It's one thing for the city to formulate a plan without court compulsion, and it's another thing to be compelled to do it.''</p>
        <p>The judge, Justice Richard F. Braun of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, will not file an order giving details on how the city could comply with his ruling until after a courtroom conference scheduled for July 25. Mr. Koerner, who is the city's chief assistant corporation counsel, said the administration would be entitled to an automatic suspension of that order as soon as it appealed.</p>
        <p>Plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit include inmates with extensive histories of serious mental illness and criminal arrests who received mental treatment and medication behind bars but were repeatedly released to the streets without any planning for how to continue treatment or find supportive housing.</p>
        <p>Up to 25,000 inmates receive mental health treatment annually in city jails. The judge's ruling directed lawyers for the seven named plaintiffs to exclude from the class those who have no continuing need for mental health treatment.</p>
        <p>''Who does the city benefit by appealing?'' asked John A. Gresham, a lawyer with New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, one of three groups representing the plaintiffs. ''The only realistic shot at getting them out of this cycle is to deal with the root causes of their behavior, and for a mentally ill person that means you have to treat the mental illness.''</p>
        <p>The city could take immediate steps to help these inmates, Mr. Gresham said. For example, he said, it could give inmates a supply of their medication on release. The state prison system does so now, and the State Legislature recently appropriated about $15 million to cover the cost of such medication when a Medicaid application has been filed a week before or a week after an inmate's release from jail.</p>
        <p>Filing applications for Medicaid and other public benefits while inmates are incarcerated is another key to solving the problem, Mr. Gresham said, because indigent, mentally ill people otherwise have no way to pay for treatment and little chance of finding supportive housing when they get out.</p>
        <p>''We're all practical,'' said Christopher K. Tahbaz, a lawyer with Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, which is representing the plaintiffs without charge. ''To do what needs to be done takes a significant effort. But there are some things the city could do today that would not take much effort at all.''</p>
        <p>The city already has a small program to link mentally ill inmates to community placements and treatment before their release, run jointly by the city's Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Alcoholism Services and the Health and Hospitals Corporation.</p>
        <p>Heather Barr, a lawyer with the Urban Justice Center and the author of a study on the mentally ill in prisons and jails, said the program served only about 7 percent of the inmates who needed such help and had been hampered by city welfare policies that made it hard for the mentally ill to obtain and keep Medicaid.</p>
        <p>The State Legislature recently appropriated enough money to expand these programs threefold, but the city has not yet applied, she added.</p>
        <p>Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman for the mental health department, said the city was reviewing the judge's decision. ''At this point, I'm not able to provide specific details on the plans being developed for services,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, citing his own experience with cancer, has announced plans to seek out and sign up people who now have no health insurance but are eligible for Medicaid.</p>
        <p>''What fundamentally has to change,'' Mr. Gresham said, ''is that the city has to go from its former position of keeping as many people as possible off benefits to aggressively trying to get people on benefits. They'll have to take the mayor's idea of going house to house to look for the eligibles, and go cell to cell to look for the eligibles.''</p>
