        <p>Justice Department lawyers and witnesses today accused Charles G. Bakaly III, the former spokesman for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, of obstructing justice by misleading colleagues and a federal court about what he told The New York Times about a possible indictment of President Clinton.</p>
        <p>In the opening day of Mr. Bakaly's trial for criminal contempt of court, a prosecutor charged that his untrue statements had caused Mr. Starr's office to file a false statement to the court in which it denied discussing the case with a reporter for The Times.</p>
        <p>John Griffith, the prosecutor, said that Mr. Bakaly made a false statement when he said that a Times reporter had assured him his sources were outside the independent counsel's office.</p>
        <p>That was ''false,'' Mr. Griffith said, because ''Mr. Bakaly knew he had been the source or a source'' of the Jan. 31, 1999, article at issue in the trial.</p>
        <p>The false statement began to unravel, Mr. Griffith said, through Mr. Bakaly's gradual admissions, which came only after he had led Mr. Starr's lawyers to file untrue information with Federal District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson. That, in turn, caused an obstruction of justice by delaying court proceedings.</p>
        <p>In response, Mr. Bakaly's lawyers argued that he had struggled to make his statement truthful and complete, but had been thwarted by a passion for secrecy among Mr. Starr's lawyers.</p>
        <p>Michele A. Roberts, a lawyer for Mr. Bakaly, said that if Mr. Starr's lawyers had accurately reflected in their court filings what he told them, they would have made it clear that Mr. Bakaly sought to steer Don Van Natta, the Times reporter, ''away from writing the article he ultimately wrote.'' That article embarrassed the Office of the Independent Counsel by making it appear it was trying to prejudice the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton.</p>
        <p>The defense has also argued that even if Mr. Bakaly's statements were judged false, no serious harm was done. But Judge Johnson has rejected that argument.</p>
        <p>Judge Johnson is hearing the criminal contempt case without a jury because the Justice Department has promised not to seek a term of more than six months in prison. She ruled on Wednesday that obstruction could be shown if the government proved the claim that Mr. Bakaly's conduct ''required the court to hold two in-chambers conferences with outside counsel for the Office of Independent Counsel and imposed unnecessary work and costs on the O.I.C.''</p>
        <p>In a city where leaks are as common as broken campaign promises, the rare spectacle of someone actually on trial for being a source proceeded with little drama and less revelation today.</p>
        <p>Several hours were devoted to questioning Donald Bucklin, a lawyer who represented Mr. Starr's office in many cases concerning allegations that the office had improperly disclosed information to reporters. Mr. Bucklin was asked mainly about the preparation of Mr. Bakaly's sworn statement.</p>
        <p>In that statement, which was presented to Judge Johnson, Mr. Bakaly denied discussing ''nonpublic'' matters with Mr. Van Natta. The January article quoted ''associates of Mr. Starr'' as saying that he had decided he had the authority to indict a sitting president and that Mr. Starr was being pressed by lawyers in his office to do so.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors hoped to use Mr. Bucklin's testimony to show that Mr. Bakaly edited and changed the statement and was responsible for what it said. Efforts to prove that the statement was false are expected to come in Friday's proceedings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bucklin quoted Mr. Bakaly as saying that in the course of three meetings with Mr. Van Natta, the reporter had said he knew that lawyers were pressing Mr. Starr to indict the president; that he also knew about a meeting to discuss four options concerning an indictment; and various other matters as well. Mr. Bucklin said that Mr. Bakaly told him the reporter said all the information had come from sources outside the counsel's office.</p>
        <p>But later, after he saw a statement by Mr. Bakaly to F.B.I. agents, Mr. Bucklin testified, he believed the original sworn statement had been false, and formally withdrew it.</p>
        <p>Another witness today, Solomon Wisenberg, a staff attorney under Mr. Starr, recalled reading in the F.B.I. interview report that Mr. Bakaly said he was the ''associate'' quoted in Mr. Van Natta's article.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wisenberg then demanded to know why Mr. Bakaly had told him he was not one of the associates the article cited. Mr. Bakaly, he said,  denied ever saying that.</p>
        <p>But on reflection, Mr. Wisenberg testified, Mr. Bakaly had in fact told him, speaking of lawyers in the office, ''Van Natta says we are not the associates referred to in the article.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wisenberg also described the meeting reported by The Times as an all-day session on Jan. 27, 1999. It had been called by Mr. Starr to determine how the office would decide whether to indict the president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wisenberg said there had been a ''stronger than usual admonition'' to keep the points of discussion secret. Upon reading the Jan. 31 article, he said, he was dismayed that obviously someone among the 20 or so lawyers present had leaked details of the meeting. He said he feared the article would make the counsel's office look as if it was engaged in a ''ham-handed'' effort to affect the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton, which was under way.</p>
