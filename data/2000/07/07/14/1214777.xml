        <p>As Gov. George W. Bush considers potential running mates, here is an appealing choice: He is a popular young governor from the fourth largest state, one where Democrats hope to compete ferociously. He is something of a policy wonk, a nice balance to Mr. Bush's celebrated aversion to minutiae. He is beloved among many Latino voters, a crucial voting bloc. He is Roman Catholic, a big plus since Mr. Bush faced accusations in the primaries that he was anti-Catholic. And he has star appeal as a scion of one of the most famous political families.</p>
        <p>The trouble is, his name is Bush.</p>
        <p>Because of an odd twist of fate, or, more precisely, electoral fortune, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, who had long been seen in the family as the one with the greatest political promise, has been crowded off the national stage by his older brother.</p>
        <p>Rather than capitalizing on his brother's fame, Jeb Bush has receded far more than is typical for a new governor of a big state. Resisting entreaties from other governors and Republican officials, Mr. Bush rarely ventures beyond Florida to take part in party functions. He shuns opportunities to speak out about his brother's campaign, except when asked about its prospects in Florida. And he will not have a high-profile speaking slot at the party's national convention late this month.</p>
        <p>''I've really been almost reclusive,'' Mr. Bush said in the first extensive interview he has given about his brother's campaign and how he fits in -- or does not. Explaining his deliberate efforts at low visibility, he cited the Bush name. ''Maybe I'm overly sensitive to it about the legacy and all that.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, a driving force behind Mr. Bush's faint profile, besides his priority of tending to Florida business, is what he said is the tangled and often hurtful predicament of constantly being compared with his father the former president and his brother the would-be president.</p>
        <p>''Any good things that are said about anything I'm doing have been historically posted up against George in a negative way,'' he said. ''Any bad things that might be said about me would be used negatively against George. I don't see how I help George by having a high profile nationally. In fact, I see the opposite.''</p>
        <p>Another inescapable reality for Jeb Bush is that as much as he and his brother love each another, friends say their relationship has never been like that of another famous set of political siblings, John and Robert Kennedy. Robert Kennedy was President Kennedy's closest adviser in the White House and would take on his enemies.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Jeb Bush, who is 47, said he chats with his 54-year-old brother only about once a week. He is not steeped in the presidential campaign, or at least is not eager to show that he is.</p>
        <p>Nor does George W. Bush seem inclined to turn to his brother. Asked recently if he would appoint Jeb Bush to a cabinet position, as President Kennedy did with his brother, George Bush offered a resounding, ''Uhhhhhh, no!''</p>
        <p>Sitting by his computer (e-mail messages popped up continuously) in his small anteroom next to his larger ceremonial office in the Capitol here, Jeb Bush talked about how he resents the contrasts with his brother and father. Jeb Bush is often portrayed in the press as more cerebral than his brother, while George W. Bush is depicted as more of a natural politician. They are both frequently described as more agile campaigners than their father.</p>
        <p>''It's hurtful to see George being criticized,'' he said. ''It's painful to see the comparisons used in a way that are hurtful. The most painful thing for me, and I know it is for George, is to see comparisons about my dad where a compliment is given to George or in some cases maybe to me, saying, 'Well, he's better.' As far as I'm concerned, my dad is as close to perfection as a human being can be.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he was particularly pained when his brother is called a lightweight. ''I don't understand why people would say it,'' he said. ''Perhaps because he's a guy's guy. He's easygoing. He has interests outside of politics and all this wonky stuff. People that really bother me are intellectuals that think they've got it all figured out, that he doesn't have the gravitas to serve. The only comfort I get is they get it wrong all the time. There's actually a political advantage to being underestimated in George's case.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush would much rather talk about Florida than about his brother. He is so averse to the limelight that he said he consented to this interview not because he finally relented after requests stretching back to last year, but because he was told that the reporter planned to write an article anyway.</p>
        <p>''Jeb has been in hot demand,'' said Gov. John Engler of Michigan. ''We're tried to have Jeb come to Michigan -- and many others have tried. Jeb just doesn't. His focus is in Tallahassee. He's very careful.''</p>
        <p>It was never supposed to be this complicated. When his brother George was still settling on a career in his late 30's, Jeb Bush was well on his way to building one in politics. He was a real estate developer in Miami and for two years served as the Florida secretary of commerce.</p>
        <p>After he declared his candidacy for governor in 1994, Mr. Bush was jolted when his brother unexpectedly jumped into the race for governor of Texas. Jeb Bush, unable to hide his consternation, groused that it would trivialize his campaign by turning it into a ''cute People magazine story.''</p>
        <p>No one, not even their mother, thought George Bush had a chance to topple Ann Richards, the fiery incumbent in Texas, and his triumph stunned the political establishment. But Jeb Bush was the loser: Gov. Lawton Chiles beat him by less than two percentage points. Four years after that initial run as a self-described ''head-banging conservative,'' Mr. Bush softened his oratory and easily beat Buddy MacKay.</p>
        <p>Had he not lost the first time, Jeb Bush might well be the Republican presidential hopeful, or, at least, a hot prospect for the second slot.</p>
        <p>''He certainly would have been on a short list,'' said Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Instead, if his brother is elected, Mr. Bush will find himself precluded from fulfilling any aspirations for the White House for four, or perhaps even eight years. In fact, win or lose, the public may have had too much of the Bush family to endure a second son running for the White House.</p>
        <p>''He certainly doesn't see himself as stuck,'' Mrs. Whitman said. ''I don't think he has regrets -- but he might if his brother isn't president.''</p>
        <p>Jeb Bush puts it this way: ''George is the right person at the right time.'' But he said his brother's success was more than ''plankton responding to heat and light.'' He said his brother benefited from his ''good naturedness'' and aggressive campaigning after the primaries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush rejects the what-ifs. He gushes so repeatedly about how he is ''blessed'' to be governor that he is either quite happy or overcompensating for the political dead-end inadvertently created for him.</p>
        <p>Unlike his wisecracking, often charming brother, Jeb Bush is earnest, quiet and often sticks to himself at gatherings with other governors. ''Shy would be an appropriate way to describe Jeb personally,'' said Gov. Bill Graves of Kansas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's tenure has been enthusiastically received by Republicans and even many Democrats. His first year went particularly well, and he got on swimmingly with the Republican-controlled Legislature. He presided over a major overhaul of the public education system and the two largest tax cuts in state history.</p>
        <p>By last November, things turned rocky after Mr. Bush sought to head off a controversial ballot measure with his own proposal, the One Florida initiative, to end racial preferences in university admissions and some public contracts. The reaction was swift and largely negative. In January, two black lawmakers staged a sit-in in Mr. Bush's offices, drawing a clutch of cameras. That prompted the governor, in rather graphic language, to bark to an aide to have the reporters removed.</p>
        <p>The situation worsened two weeks later in Miami at a forum on Mr. Bush's proposal. The governor sat in the front row for hours as speaker after speaker savaged him.</p>
        <p>''The low point probably was the hearing in Miami -- 2,000 people shouting ugly things about me,'' Mr. Bush recalled. ''What I concluded was that the things that were being said were not particularly rational. It was raw emotion.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush is haunted by that period, he did not betray that. In fact, he took a reporter on a tour of where the sit-in occurred. ''I regret losing my temper,'' he said. But he stands by the One Florida initiative because, he said, it has already resulted in more minorities attending public universities in Florida.</p>
        <p>''If I had a 'D' by my name,'' he said, ''all the partisans would say, 'Fantastic.' The fact that I'm a Republican is possibly threatening.''</p>
        <p>The firestorm seems to have subsided. While Democrats vow to invoke the initiative to mobilize black voters in November to back Vice President Al Gore, polls show that the governor remains quite popular. A survey of likely Florida voters conducted June 23-26 by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research found the governor's approval rating at 63 percent, the highest of any Florida governor since Bob Graham in 1986.</p>
        <p>Jeb Bush is so focused on Florida that the one hint of his brother's campaign is displayed on the bottom shelf of one cabinet: a commemorative Texas license plate that proclaims, ''G.W. Bush, President.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush does offer his brother counsel now and then. Most recently, he said, he urged him ''to address  elder issues, and he'll do more of that.'' He added, ''They easily fall prey to scare tactics and I'm convinced that Gore, when confronted with the realities of where he is, will resort to fear.''</p>
        <p>Like any successful siblings, there is a competitive edge between the two. Yet if Jeb Bush harbors any jealousy, he does his best to suppress it. Playfully, he lets it be known that his more famous brother is not above appropriating his ideas. In the 1994 campaign, one of Jeb Bush's favorite lines was that he was running not because he was George and Barbara's son, but because of his own children's futures. ''He stole it lock, stock and barrel,'' Jeb Bush said.</p>
        <p>More recently, he said, George Bush picked up his idea of offering school vouchers, or state scholarships, to students in schools where many are not performing well.</p>
        <p>And when the two appeared at a news conference in Plant City, Fla., in March, George Bush said he might consider reducing the gas tax. Then Jeb Bush piped in with an eloquent explanation of why he did not think that was wise because it would take away much needed money for highways. George Bush later relented.</p>
        <p>''I said one of the problems with reducing the gas tax in Washington is states like Texas and Florida have to make adjustments in their road construction programs because in our state we have real congested roads,'' he said. ''I should have kept my mouth shut. But he acknowledged it was a good point.''</p>
        <p>In return, Jeb Bush said he has learned from his brother, to the point that he has emulated him. ''I've tried to steal the very formula that made him successful,'' he said. ''To have a clear agenda. To let the world know what it is. And then do what you said you were going to do. It's so easy to do the opposite.''</p>
        <p>While Jeb Bush is shunning the national stage, George P. Bush, the eldest son of the governor and his Mexican-born wife, Columba, is filling the void in his own way. At 24, he has the poise and good looks that have made him something of a sensation on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>Told that his visitor had not seen George P.'s television commercials for his uncle in which he appeals to Latinos and Generation Xers, Jeb Bush grabbed a videotape and seemed on the verge of tears as he proudly showed off his son.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was not even disapproving of his son posing on a bed for photographers at People magazine, where he made the list of 100 most eligible bachelors (he ranked fourth). ''I asked him that last night, actually, why he went with the bed scene instead of the stand-up shot,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He's pretty handsome vertically. He said that's the way they wanted it.''</p>
        <p>Jeb Bush is well aware that there could be ''missed opportunities.'' But he seems resigned to leaving the big stage to his brother and son.</p>
        <p>Asked why he is retreating to the sidelines at the convention, Jeb Bush said, ''I'll yield my time to George P.''</p>
