        <p>Mike Piazza believes an important part of his success is his refusal to complicate anything. Extra batting practice is better left to the scientists of hitting, and Piazza did not once come out for early batting practice in the first half of the season.</p>
        <p>But he had a reason to change his routine today. Piazza had spent four days resting from a slight concussion after he was beaned by Roger Clemens at Yankee Stadium last Saturday.</p>
        <p>So he showed up at Fenway Park at 2 p.m. to take some swings against Rick Reed. Piazza felt fine, told Manager Bobby Valentine he was ready to play and was back as the Mets' catcher and cleanup hitter for the game against Pedro Martinez and the Boston Red Sox.</p>
        <p>''You feel sluggish, you feel a little woozy,'' Piazza said. ''That seems to pass just with time and getting rest. I feel very fortunate. I feel like I have recovered pretty well from it.''</p>
        <p>The Red Sox had to feel that way, too, after Piazza lashed a two-out single to right-center field in the eighth inning tonight that pushed across the Mets' third run in a game they lost, 4-3, an inning later.</p>
        <p>''I'm happy I was able to return and not feel uncomfortable as far as being hesitant,'' said Piazza, who went 1 for 4 and played all nine innings. ''I think the first pitch Pedro threw me was up and in a little bit. I wasn't flinching, I just didn't swing the bat that well. But the timing wasn't because of any sort of trepidation.''</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, suggested this week that the Mets were using their outrage over Piazza's beaning as a publicity stunt to divert attention from losing three of four games to the Yankees. Piazza had a good laugh at that one before tonight's game.</p>
        <p>''It's a P.R. stunt?'' he said. ''That's a heck of a P.R. stunt. Next time we're going to pull a stunt like that, I'll volunteer not to be the guinea pig. Trust me.''</p>
        <p>Valentine, singled out by Steinbrenner as the architect of the public-relations campaign, responded with sarcasm.</p>
        <p>''Any time George would mention me, I'd be flattered,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Then he turned serious.</p>
        <p>''Unless you've been looking down at someone who's been hit in the head or looking up at people looking at you,'' Valentine said, ''you shouldn't have anything to say about that arena, because you don't know anything about that arena.''</p>
        <p>Piazza, of course, knows it all too well, and not just from Clemens's  pitch. Awaiting Piazza at Fenway tonight was Martinez, who came up and in on Piazza two years ago and knocked him out of the game when he hit the catcher's left hand with a pitch.</p>
        <p>Piazza, who was 0 for 3 against Martinez tonight and is 7 for 20 in his career, took the same stance on Martinez that he is now taking on Clemens. It is in the past, and it is time to move on.</p>
        <p>Piazza had been hit in the head only once before, in the minors in 1991 by a soft-throwing left-hander, and he seemed somewhat shaken, or at least cautious about what might await him.</p>
        <p>But today he insisted that he would not have asked to play if he thought he would have any fear from the incident.</p>
        <p>''Having a few days off, your mind has a way of suppressing it, at least mine does, real quickly,'' Piazza said. ''If there was hesitation to get in the box, then I would have taken more time. But I feel like I have my balance and everything feels good, and that's when I decided to go back and play.''</p>
        <p>Valentine, who was hit in the face as a minor leaguer, said he would be surprised if Piazza experienced any long-term effects from the beaning.</p>
        <p>''He gets through things,'' Valentine said. ''He gets through injuries, he gets through situations a lot quicker than most people. But I have no way of telling.''</p>
        <p>Piazza said he had not seen a doctor since the hours after the incident on Saturday night. He said he probably will have a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging test when the team returns home in 10 days.</p>
        <p>He spent the All-Star Game break resting and receiving messages of support from friends and fans. He watched only a bit of the game, to which he had been elected as a starter. He has no plans to communicate with Clemens.</p>
        <p>''If I run into him down the line, I don't know what's going to happen,'' Piazza said. ''We'll see what happens. I haven't thought about it.''</p>
