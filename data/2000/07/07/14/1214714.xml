        <p>The American defense secretary and Chinese leaders made hopeful pledges of cooperation and friendship today despite evidence of deep rifts over important military policies and Chinese suspicions about American intentions in Asia.</p>
        <p>Two days of high-level meetings began and ended with smiles and handshakes, a sign of how strongly both sides want to avoid open, dangerous antagonism.</p>
        <p>But officials also struggled with potentially explosive disputes, including American plans for missile defense and continued arms sales to Taiwan, as well as American contentions that China recently helped Pakistan develop ballistic missiles.</p>
        <p>Chinese officials endured a new humiliation after Israel said on Wednesday that it was reneging on a $250 million deal, five years in the making, to sell Beijing an airborne radar system. Israel canceled the sale under heavy pressure from the United States, which fears that the system could be used to track fighter planes in a battle over the Taiwan Strait, the most likely scene of direct Chinese-American conflict.</p>
        <p>In a 90-minute meeting this afternoon, President Jiang Zemin brought up the canceled sale, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said. ''It was certainly of concern to China,'' Mr. Cohen told reporters, but he said the tone of his meetings was generally positive. Mr. Cohen met nearly every top political and military leader and spoke to military officers at the National Defense University.</p>
        <p>As he greeted Mr. Cohen today, China's top soldier, Zhang Wannian, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed ''how important it is for China and the United States to have a healthy and stable relationship.''</p>
        <p>Officials from both sides said they were pleased that military visits and talks, suspended after the United States bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last year, were largely restored. But Mr. Cohen could offer the Chinese no convincing answers to concerns about proposed missile defenses and arms sales to Taiwan. And it was also clear that China had not effectively countered American contentions that it has aided Pakistan and Iran's missile development, possibly violating pledges.</p>
        <p>In a separate news conference, China's chief arms control official, Sha Zukang, said his country had on three occasions, most recently in a joint statement by Presidents Jiang and Clinton in 1998, pledged not to help either India or Pakistan develop missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. He scoffed at reported American intelligence findings that China had provided such technical aid to Pakistan, its strategic ally, in the last 18 months.</p>
        <p>This afternoon Mr. Cohen said of the missile questions only, ''These issues are still under discussion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sha repeated China's vehement warnings that it saw the proposed American missile defense as negating China's small nuclear forces. China also opposes the American-Japanese program to develop regional missile defenses, which could be used to shield Taiwan. China considers Taiwan part of the nation that has to return eventually, if not by peace then by war.</p>
        <p>In a speech to officers this morning at the National Defense University north of Beijing, Mr. Cohen described the American military presence in Asia as a benign, stabilizing factor rather than, as many Chinese believe, intended to hem in an increasingly powerful China.</p>
