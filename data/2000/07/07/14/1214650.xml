        <p>Who would pay thousands of dollars for weeks in a mosquito-infested enclave with mediocre food, no indoor plumbing and a lake whose temperature is just right for penguins?</p>
        <p>Parents, that's who. Tada, the children's theater troupe, sends up this rite of passage uproariously in ''Everything About Camp (Almost).''</p>
        <p>A revue with scenes by Michael Slade and songs by numerous authors, the hourlong show spoofs mess-hall menus, campfire ghost stories, swimming lessons, pranks (rife, I'm afraid, with novel suggestions) and the exhortations of well-meaning moms and dads. The name of the place is a gem: Camp Ichikawaooeeemakhooyahoo.</p>
        <p>Among the standout numbers are ''Bugs,'' whose hilarious choreography, by Dani Altiere, consists of frenzied bats, slaps and waves, and ''Postcard Home,'' a ballad sung in the form of a boy's note to his parents. Audiences will find poignancy as well as humor in the homesickness that looms rather largely between the lines.</p>
        <p>Directed by Janine Nina Trevens and enthusiastically presented by the young company, the production reflects the typical summer experience. Except that the show, unlike some camps, is always fun.</p>
        <p>''Everything About Camp (Almost),'' through July 30 at Tada, 120 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-1732. Shows: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays at noon and 2 p.m.; Saturdays and Sunday, July 30, at 1 and 3 p.m. Tickets: $12; children, $6. Reservations advised.</p>
        <p>Let Them Eat Crepes</p>
        <p>The first line of ''La Marseillaise'' urges on the ''children of the fatherland,'' telling them ''the day of glory has arrived.'' Although the anthem clearly refers to the patriotic souls of the French Revolution, on Sunday it could well be a rallying call to some children in New York City, who may earn some French glory of their own.</p>
        <p>They will take part in the first children's waiters race in the Bastille Day on 60th Street celebration. The competition is to complement the adult waiters' race, based on those held in France. In the adult event, waiters and waitresses in long aprons dash along a course, holding aloft trays, each set with a bottle of aperitif and two filled glasses. Like French cuisine, the contestants are held to the highest standards: the winner must not only make good time but also fail to spill a drop.</p>
        <p>The 1 p.m. children's race, which will have two divisions (ages 8 to 10 and ages 11 to 12), will be slightly different. In addition to adjustments for safety and appropriateness -- the children will carry water, and all containers will be plastic -- ''we created an obstacle course to make it fun,'' said David Black, the executive director of the French Institute Alliance Francaise, which holds the fete.</p>
        <p>''At one point, there will be a limbo line,'' he said. Each child will also do a silly walk, blow a whistle and place a French or American flag in his or her cap. The grand prizes are iMac computers, and all competitors will receive goody bags from Vivendi, one of the festival's sponsors.</p>
        <p>As well as the races (registration is now filled), Bastille Day on 60th Street will offer a huge fair, with the block between Madison and Fifth Avenues devoted to family entertainment. The attractions are to include a marching band, a parade, a rollerblade-dance company, unicyclists and performers from the Big Apple Circus.</p>
        <p>Children may also have their faces painted, eat French food, make a collage and, naturellement, learn a little French when the Jacques and Marie Show ends the day with songs.</p>
        <p>Bastille Day on 60th Street, Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., between Lexington and Fifth Avenues. Free. Information: (212) 355-6100, Extension 279.</p>
        <p>Fetch? Moi?</p>
        <p>Ask cat owners to define oxymoron, and most can come up with an easy example: feline obedience.</p>
        <p>But that doesn't have to be the case, says Karen Thomas. Ms. Thomas, a Hollywood animal trainer, will demonstrate her methods tomorrow and Sunday at the Friskies and CFA Garden State Cat Club Show, a competition for pedigreed and household cats. She will be accompanied by feline beauties, all stars on cat-food commercials.</p>
        <p>''We will have one of the cats playing basketball,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''Our Fancy Feast cat plays the piano, and the Chef's Blend cat pushes a grocery cart.'' Another is adept with a mouse. This wouldn't seem unusual, except that the mouse's tail is attached to a computer, not a furry little body. (The cat types, too.)</p>
        <p>The key to training is a device called a clicker. You click it while feeding your cat, so the animal associates the sound with food. Ms. Thomas will show how to tape the clicker to a spoon filled with cat food and use the food as a reward.</p>
        <p>She recommends starting with a simple command, like ''Sit.'' ''You raise the spoon slightly over their head,'' Ms. Thomas explained. ''They're going to tend to look up at it. When they do that, their tush tends to sit. You want to guide them, not force them.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Thomas admitted that it's best to choose tricks that include the cat's favorite activities. ''You're not going to force your cat to do something it doesn't like to do naturally,'' she said. (As if we needed to be told.)</p>
        <p>The Friskies and CFA Garden State Cat Club Show, tomorrow and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Garden State Exhibit Center, 50 Atrium Drive, Somerset, N.J., (800) 725-4228. Training demonstrations (free with admission) at noon, 1:30 and 3 p.m. each day. Admission: $8; the elderly and children under 12, $4.</p>
