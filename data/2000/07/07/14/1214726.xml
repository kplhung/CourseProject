        <p>Britain has most congested roads in Europe, and probably more road rage than any other country; much of this hostility is focused on so-called 'white van men,' drivers of country's estimated 2.5 million, traditionally white, commercial vans, who are viewed as aggressive, no-holds-barred kings of the road; several van drivers in town of Leatherland comment on their driving habits and criticism directed at them; map; photos (Leatherland Journal) (M)</p>

        <p>In his hands he has a wheel; in his ears, rings; on his arms, tattoos; and in his heart, loathing for anyone he sees through his windshield. He is known as White Van Man, and he is identified in motorist surveys as the scourge of the stressed-out British road.</p>
        <p>Once in the driver's seat, he considers red lights relative and his own authority absolute. His vocabulary is the kind represented in newspapers by asterisks, and the hand signals he uses to find his way are the kind that tell everyone else to get lost.</p>
        <p>That, at least, is the popular caricature of the men who pilot the estimated 2.5 million commercial vans every day around Britain, a country with the most congested roads in Europe and probably higher road rage than any country on the Continent.</p>
        <p>The Oxford-based Social Issues Research Center found that white van men are viewed with the hostility and opprobrium Britons previously reserved for the soccer hooligans who almost got England disqualified from the European soccer championship last month.</p>
        <p>''Van drivers have taken on the mantle of what sociologists refer to as 'folk devils,' '' said Peter Marsh, the center's director. ''Like other species of animal, he feels most confident on his own turf, so a note of caution. When you obstruct the passage of a white van, you are often preventing the driver traveling freely on what he perceives to be his road.''</p>
        <p>White Van Man gets his name from his vehicle. Most vans in Britain are white because that's the way they arrive from the factory. Delivery services do not want the expense of painting them, and their resale value is higher if they stay that color.</p>
        <p>In fairness to White Van Man, the world he inhabits is given to aggravation. A study of 10,000 drivers in 16 European countries by Gallup International showed that British motorists suffer from intense road rage and are the first to resort to obscene gestures to relieve pent-up anger.</p>
        <p>The key factor behind the prevalence of aggressive driving is congestion. At any time, there are up to 24 million cars on the road, and there is an average of 108 vehicles per mile. twice that of France.</p>
        <p>A study by Britain's Automobile Association said that British drivers face longer commuting times, higher costs and bigger risks of car crime than any of their European counterparts. They are also the least likely to have acceptable public transportation or cycling options. Investment in public transportation and roads relative to the size of the economy is a third lower in Britain than typical European levels, and 9 in 10 journeys in Britain are made by car, the highest proportion in Europe.</p>
        <p>Road repair also seems to take inordinate amounts of time. One set of ''temporary'' emergency traffic barriers still stand along an infamous stretch of highway at Barking Creek in East London where they were installed in 1988.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marsh found in his study that the white van drivers operate under their own tribal rules. He uncovered, for instance, White Van Man's standards for permitting someone to cut ahead: black taxis: never; buses: very rarely; women drivers: depends what they look like; other white van drivers: always.</p>
        <p>Tourists may think the London cabdriver the world's politest, but to Andrew Hall, 30, a four-year white van man from Leatherhead in the London suburbs, ''they drive like they own the world.'' Even more irritating are bicyclists. ''You hit a bicycle, you get the blame, right?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall was relaxing in The Running Horse pub after a nine-hour day of delivery runs that took him 200 miles around southeast England.</p>
        <p>He protested the criticism of his class but admitted he understood how it got started. ''I don't go through red lights, for instance, but if it's, well, just going into red, I might slip through,'' he said. ''And,'' he warned, ''I never stop on amber.''</p>
        <p>He said that he avoided road arguments himself but that he had seen colleagues ''in a bit of a right row many times, especially at the traffic lights.''</p>
        <p>''Normally at the lights,'' he said,  ''that's where the verbals start.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marsh said he was not surprised to find that white van men think they are good drivers because, he said, all men do. ''Previous SIRC research has shown that for 75 percent of male drivers, to admit that you are a bad driver is a bit like confessing that you are lousy in bed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>New gasoline price increases that have taken the price of filling up a van to $80 have become a big issue in Britain, and what car you drive has become a defining point in British politics. The two leading parties are fighting for the votes of the middle Englander, an everyman character often identified in the press as Mondeo man, after the midrange Ford model with that name. When Conservative officials made their first moves last year to recover the middle-class voters who deserted the party for Labor in the 1997 election, one of the first things they did was try to buy the membership lists of the Royal Automobile Club and the Automobile Association.</p>
        <p>With a national election widely considered to be less than a year away, White Van Man may finally start getting some respect. The ardently populist Sun, Britain's largest-selling daily tabloid, has created a question and answer column with a new driver each week. In a typical submission, Jamie Valler, 32, of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, said: ''In the past we've been stereotyped as nutters on the road. But now the nation can see most of us have sensible opinions.''</p>
        <p>The column is promoted as ''the authentic voice of the street, the real views of real people, the opinions of people who vote rather than those who get elected, the views of people who pay taxes and bills rather than just pontificate on them.''</p>
        <p>People claiming those credentials are going to get a lot of attention from politicians. Shortly after the debut of the feature, another contributor, Simon Todd, 43, of Gillingham, Kent, found himself not only no longer maligned. He and his white van were invited to have pictures taken with government officials in front of 10 Downing Street.</p>
