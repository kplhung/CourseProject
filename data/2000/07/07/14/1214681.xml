        <p>A diaspora is a many-leveled thing, for the simple reason that people never travel light. No matter how meager their physical possessions, they carry beliefs, traditions, sensibilities, ways of talking, thinking, seeing and doing, all in their heads. Wherever they arrive, things are never the same: sooner or later there are modulations, great or small, in local habits of clothing, religion, diet and art and much else. Something new has been added.</p>
        <p>In New York, one of the world's great beneficiaries of diasporas, this process is everywhere visible. We move through it daily in a diffuse, taken-for-granted, way. In a subway ride, a change of blocks or boroughs, even a walk around a corner, it is possible to dip into another culture, a different way of life.</p>

        <p>A diaspora is a many-leveled thing, for the simple reason that people never travel light. No matter how meager their physical possessions, they carry beliefs, traditions, sensibilities, ways of talking, thinking, seeing and doing, all in their heads. Wherever they arrive, things are never the same: sooner or later there are modulations, great or small, in local habits of clothing, religion, diet and art and much else. Something new has been added.</p>
        <p>In New York, one of the world's great beneficiaries of diasporas, this process is everywhere visible. We move through it daily in a diffuse, taken-for-granted, way. In a subway ride, a change of blocks or boroughs, even a walk around a corner, it is possible to dip into another culture, a different way of life.</p>
        <p>Still, it never hurts to see the rhythms of this process in isolation, especially when they are traced through the migration of an entrancing, universally loved artistic form and presented in visually dazzling terms. This is the achievement of ''Beads, Body and Soul: Art and Light in the Yoruba Universe.''</p>
        <p>The show, as opulent as it is edifying, follows the migration of one people's beading tradition, and the religious beliefs it reflects, from Africa to various parts of the Americas. Originally organized by the Fowler Museum of Cultural History at the University of California at Los Angeles, this effort is now split between two of New York's smaller, more innovative arts institutions: the Museum for African Art in SoHo and the Studio Museum in Harlem.</p>
        <p>The Yoruba people are not alone in attributing spiritual power and religious meaning to beads or in grasping their visual and decorative potential. But they may be somewhat unusual in doing both at the same time. And this double intensity helps explain why their use of beads, and the immense faith they have in them, survived the devastations and dispersals of the slave trade to flourish in the Americas, especially in Brazil and Cuba, where Yoruba descendants are most plentiful, and in New York, which has sizable populations of Afro-Cubans and Afro-Brazilians as well as African-Americans of Yoruba descent.</p>
        <p>Yoruba beading, its sources, techniques, meanings and permutations in this hemisphere, form a rich, complex subject, as this show's lavishly illustrated, multischolar catalog suggests. It is an implicitly hybrid art. An indigenous bead language using oil-palm seeds and kernels, carved wood beads and especially cowrie shells (still the aristocrat of Yoruba beads) was irrevocably expanded when Europeans began taking tiny pierced bits of glass and ceramic to Africa as early as the 15th century.</p>
        <p>It is also a pervasive art: Yorubans have made necklaces, bracelets and bead-covered objects central to both religious and daily life, to expressions of faith and social rank. The beads' pure colors heightened the chromatic symbolism of the Yoruba religious cosmos with its hierarchies of spirits, ancestors and gods, or orisa, each distinguished by specific hues. Beads adorn the ritual objects and regalia of those gods' earthly representatives: kings and queens, priests, diviners and healers. The one-by-one equality of stringed beads is seen as reflecting the consensus-oriented Yoruba social structure. The word for bead recurs in their language, in metaphors for riches of all kinds: children, wealth, solidarity and wisdom.</p>
        <p>The journey plotted by this exhibition begins at the Museum for African Art, with displays of necklaces and objects using indigenous beads: necklaces of palm-oil seeds, a small shrine dangling heavy strands of cowrie shells. Especially notable are three small wood figures of Esu-Elegba, the god who mediates the threshold between the mortal and the spirit worlds, festooned with strands of lustrous kernels, cowries and carved wood amulets.</p>
        <p>The exhibition first proceeds by deity. There are beaded sword sheaths associated with Ogun, god of iron and warfare; a staff for Orisa Oko, the god of agriculture, its tall beaded sheath decorated with sculptures of women; a wonderful fat puppet for Sanyin, the god of healing.</p>
        <p>It is clear that the introduction of brighter color made possible what might be called portable mosaics, objects whose colored images and rich patterns radiate joy, order and reverence as surely as anything at Ravenna. It also seems to have made possible the development of a pictorial, two-dimensional language equal to but different from the sculptural tradition already in place. Among the exhibition's most engaging objects are several pairs of Ibeji, or sacred twins, small carved wood figures whose little beaded tunics gleam with geometric patterns and images. These are grouped near an extraordinary full-size tunic, whose surfaces, worked and reworked with beads and cowries, resembles a lovingly tended shrine.</p>
        <p>One sees the mingling of cultures on all sides. A king's regalia include a beaded chair, whose floral patterns might be English, and a gown beaded in gold, white and blue whose spiraling forms can also be found on Islamic tiles. (The surface includes the date of coronation date, 1934.) Across the way, some beaded crowns and coronets borrow the forms of a bishop's miter and a British barrister's wig. Others, more indigenous, are dramatically sculptural conical crowns whose beaded surfaces are decorated with schematic faces and topped with beaded birds and other animals. A group of ''House of the Head'' shrines, containing the small beaded personal pyramids, or ''inner heads,'' that Yoruba people receive at birth, bristle majestically with cowrie shells.</p>
        <p>The exhibition at the Museum for African Art ends with a display of the diviner's regalia: beaded tapers, chains, bags and necklaces, as well as two stunning examples of the elaborate head-to-toe ensembles worn during Egungun ceremonies, which honor ancestors. Suggesting a cross between a Muslim chador and something suitable for a Venetian masked ball, they combine layers of dark rich fabric with glittering panels and veils of beads.</p>
        <p>The exhibition at the Studio Museum in Harlem, which is relatively sparse, examines the Yoruba beading and religious practices in the Americas, where orisa permutated into Santeria in Cuba and Candomble in Brazil while retaining the same gods. The show is arranged in a series of altars containing objects made by contemporary artists, many of whom are also priests.</p>
        <p>The altars seem a bit flimsy, partly because, once again, the objects themselves exude such concentrated power. Nonetheless, Jose Rodriguez's crown for Oblata, a god of ancient wisdom, which is rendered in white, silver and blue beading and topped with a bird riding an elephant, has the radiant perfection of anything in the downtown show. And one sees new variations on older themes and forms. Shona Sloan-Shango Ni Ohun's paintinglike ''Beaded Portrait of a Devotee of Orisa Shango'' includes depictions of a rattle and conical crown like those displayed downtown; they belong to a figure who resembles the bead-garbed twins at the SoHo museum.</p>
        <p>Works like these suggest that the beading tradition the Yoruba people set forth is alive, well and in good hands.</p>
        <p>''Beads, Body and Soul: Art and Light in the Yoruba Universe'' is at the Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313, through Aug. 27, and at the Studio Museum in Harlem, 145 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, through Sept. 17.</p>
