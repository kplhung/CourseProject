        <p>Editors note: several passages in June 27 obituary of Vera Atkins should have been attributed to The Times of London</p>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An obituary on June 27 about Vera Atkins, who recruited and trained British secret agents sent to France in World War II, reported on her education and upbringing, the methods she used to help train the agents and her intense loyalty to them. The 1,000-word article was based substantially on The Times's research in books, but some information came as well from The Times of London and other British publications.</p>
        <p>Five brief passages in the obituary closely reflected the phrasing of an obituary in The Times of London. These were references to Ms. Atkins's background, to her attempts to trace missing agents, to the training regimen for agents and to Ms. Atkins's retirement. Although the London paper was cited as a source for some material, those five passages should also have been attributed to it, or should have been rephrased.</p>
