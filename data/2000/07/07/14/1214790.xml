        <p>The top two leaders of Salt Lake City's scandal-plagued bid to secure the 2002 Winter Olympics have declined a federal plea arrangement, leaving the United States Justice Department to decide whether to take another approach in prosecuting the alleged vote-buying scheme.</p>
        <p>Tom Welch, the head of the bid committee, and his chief assistant, Dave Johnson, declined to make a deal with prosecutors because they were being asked to admit to things that they did not do, an attorney representing Johnson told reporters in Salt Lake City yesterday.</p>
        <p>''We will listen to any proposal that is consistent with the facts,'' Johnson's attorney, Max Wheeler, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Welch and Johnson declined a deal to plead guilty to obstructing the Internal Revenue Service from collecting taxes, Wheeler said. This charge apparently stems from the case of the former American Olympic official, Alfredo La Mont, who agreed to a plea bargain and pleaded guilty to evading taxes on $48,514 made in a consulting arrangement with the Salt Lake City bid committee.</p>
        <p>La Mont was forced to resign from the United States Olympic Committee last year after it was divulged that he had also gathered information on members of the International Olympic Committee in a separate arrangement with bid officials.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, I.O.C. delegates voted overwhelmingly for Salt Lake City to be host for the 2002 Winter Games. However, a scandal last year revealed that bid officials had spent up to $4 million in a vote-buying scheme by offering cash payments, scholarships, expensive gifts and other baubles to delegates. Ten members of the I.O.C. have resigned or have been removed from their positions, and a series of reforms was instituted last December. Delegates are now prohibited from visiting bid cities.</p>
        <p>Welch and Johnson have claimed that they were simply following the long-accepted practices of bidding on the Winter and Summer Games, that their methods were widely known in Salt Lake City and that they were being made scapegoats by prosecutors. They are no longer associated with the committee organizing the 2002 Winter Games.</p>
        <p>A Salt Lake City businessman has pleaded guilty to tax fraud, and John Kim, the son of a powerful I.O.C. delegate from South Korea, Kim Un-yong, has been indicted in the scandal. Both cases involve an alleged conspiracy to provide John Kim with a phony job.</p>
        <p>Richard Wiedis, the Justice Department attorney heading the Salt Lake City investigation, declined to comment yesterday. Wheeler said that he and Welch's attorney were waiting for prosecutors to make a new plea offer. The Justice Department could decide to seek indictments or to make another plea deal. Negotiations remained open, Wheeler said.</p>
