        <p>The House Ways and Means Committee today approved legislation that would significantly raise maximum allowable contributions to individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans.</p>
        <p>The bill would gradually increase, over three years, the maximum annual contribution to individual retirement accounts, to $5,000 from $2,000. The change would apply both to conventional retirement accounts, under which contributions are tax deductible, and to Roth I.R.A.'s, under which contributions are taxable but withdrawals are tax free.</p>

        <p>The House Ways and Means Committee today approved legislation that would significantly raise maximum allowable contributions to individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans.</p>
        <p>The bill would gradually increase, over three years, the maximum annual contribution to individual retirement accounts, to $5,000 from $2,000. The change would apply both to conventional retirement accounts, under which contributions are tax deductible, and to Roth I.R.A.'s, under which contributions are taxable but withdrawals are tax free.</p>
        <p>The bill would increase, over five years, the maximum annual employee contribution to 401(k) accounts, to $15,000 from $10,500.</p>
        <p>The vote was 27 to 9, with 5 Democrats joining 22 Republicans on the committee in favor.</p>
        <p>The bill now goes to the House floor, where a vote is expected in the next week or two.</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether the Senate will consider similar legislation this year.</p>
        <p>The legislation would also allow some people, under some circumstances, to make additional contributions above the maximum amounts to retirement accounts and 401(k) plans. People who are at least 50 years old would be allowed to contribute to individual retirement accounts as much as $5,000 a year starting next year, instead of having to wait for the higher limits to be phased in over three years.</p>
        <p>The bill would reduce federal revenue by an estimated $54 billion over 10 years.</p>
