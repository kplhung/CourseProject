        <p>Stephon Marbury leaned back in his chair and, as usual, surveyed the floor, a not-so casual observer nodding in approval.</p>
        <p>Marbury, the Nets' point guard, had just finished his own daily workout before he wandered into the team's minicamp at the Champion Center.</p>
        <p>Marbury liked the activity, not so much for the odd assortment of fringe players, but for the frequent whistles and impassioned instructions he heard from the coaching staff. And for the sprints.</p>
        <p>To Marbury, it all signaled a new Nets team, a new era and a new attitude, emanating from a new head coach, Byron Scott.</p>
        <p>''Byron is like: 'Do it. Do it right. If you're not going to do it right, don't do it,' '' Marbury said. ''He stresses fundamentals and defense. In the N.B.A., if you play defense, you're going to win games.''</p>
        <p>The thought of winning caused Marbury to smile. After enduring a disappointing record last season, he welcomes change with a bear hug.</p>
        <p>''I'm very excited,'' Marbury said. ''The only way we can go is up.''</p>
        <p>But first, back and forth.</p>
        <p>On his first day of camp, Scott made his 17 players run sprints and attack the drills he and his coaching staff of Eddie Jordan and Mike O'Koren had meticulously prepared. Scott also talked to a wide-eyed Marbury, who knew he would be performing those same sprints in the fall.</p>
        <p>''I walked over to him and said, 'Get ready for it,' '' Scott said. ''This is how we're going to play.''</p>
        <p>Scott, with a laugh, added, ''He looked at me and said, 'Goll-ee.' ''</p>
        <p>As much as Marbury has sized up Scott, a former guard who owns three National Basketball Association championship rings, the new coach has been equally impressed with his point guard.</p>
        <p>''He's very mature,'' Scott said. ''He looks at tapes. He's a very, very intelligent guy. There's no doubt that he has a lot more talent than I had. This kid has a hunger to win and I like that.''</p>
        <p>This early symbiosis of star player and coach seemed a good omen for the first practice of the season, where new is common. The Nets start with a new president, Rod Thorn, a new advance scout, Lawrence Franks, who was brought in from Vancouver, and a new trainer, Tim Walsh. Scott hopes to name his third assistant within two weeks.</p>
        <p>He and his staff treated minicamp almost like a playoff practice. It is, instead, how they will choose the 12 players for next week's Shaw Pro Summer League in Boston.</p>
        <p>''From Day 1, we emphasized this is a whole different team, this is a different perspective,'' Scott said. ''We want to win every game. We want to approach it that way no matter if it's a pickup game or a summer league.''</p>
        <p>The Nets' first-round pick, Kenyon Martin, who is still rehabilitating a broken leg, will not play in the summer league, but the second-round pick, Soumaila Samake, a 7-foot-1-inch center from Mali, West Africa, attended the minicamp yesterday.</p>
        <p>Samake, 22, played at Cincinnati in the International Basketball League and professionally in Slovenia the previous season.</p>
        <p>Evan Eschmeyer, a second-year Nets center, joined the group of journeymen that included Marty Conlon, a former Providence center trying to make his 10th N.B.A. roster, and Doug Smith, a former 1991 first-round draft pick of Dallas.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to find a diamond in the rough from summer camp,'' General Manager John Nash said.</p>
        <p>The Nets need free agents to fill their immediate needs: small forward and shooting guard. Nash said that in addition to filing for the disabled exception for Jayson Williams, who retired last month when his broken leg failed to heal, the team filed a salary exception for the shooting guard Kerry Kittles, who is recovering from his second knee surgery in two years.</p>
        <p>''At this point, we're proceeding under the assumption that he's not going to be available to us,'' Nash said. ''I think the doctor feels very comfortable that Kerry can make a full recovery, but that it may take a full year.''</p>
        <p>While they are talking with Kendall Gill about returning, Nash said the Nets hope to bring in other players in the next two weeks, saying that the name of Orlando Magic guard Ron Mercer has come up in discussions.</p>
        <p>''We will not be as public as the Knicks about it,'' Nash said. ''We've talked about the possibility of inviting a couple of players in but we haven't made any definite plans.''</p>
        <p>As for Gill, who is a free agent, Nash said, ''We're uncommitted and he's uncommitted.'' If they re-sign Gill, he could move into the backcourt and play the two-guard position and along with Martin, and ''we could go forward without that giant gaping hole left by the absence of Kittles,'' Nash said.</p>
        <p>As for today's practice, Nash said: ''I thought that Byron set a tremendous tone. I thought that the entire coaching staff took a very professional, aggressive attitude and the players responded.''</p>
