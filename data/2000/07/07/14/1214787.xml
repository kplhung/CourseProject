        <p>The State Board of Regents voted unanimously today to support an Education Department plan to close the troubled junior and senior high schools in Roosevelt, on Long Island, next year and possibly disperse their students to surrounding districts if the schools do not meet certain academic and administrative goals in the upcoming school year.</p>
        <p>The Regents expressed frustration, however, that the plan does not move quickly enough to deal with the problems that have kept the Roosevelt secondary schools operating at substandard levels for as long as a decade.

        <p>The State Board of Regents voted unanimously today to support an Education Department plan to close the troubled junior and senior high schools in Roosevelt, on Long Island, next year and possibly disperse their students to surrounding districts if the schools do not meet certain academic and administrative goals in the upcoming school year.</p>
        <p>The Regents expressed frustration, however, that the plan does not move quickly enough to deal with the problems that have kept the Roosevelt secondary schools operating at substandard levels for as long as a decade. And one member of the board warned his colleagues that ''the politics of race'' in Nassau County will work against any attempt by the Education Department to send Roosevelt students, who are overwhelmingly poor and black and Hispanic, to the surrounding wealthier and mostly white districts.</p>
        <p>Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, told the Regents that he believes that the Roosevelt school district and its board of education ''can do the things that need to be done'' to turn the district around this year.</p>
        <p>Those tasks include filling district leadership positions, outlining a tougher curriculum for junior and senior high school students, devising an operable financial plan and involving parents and community members in the school system. The district's students must also meet specific targets on standardized math and English tests.</p>
        <p>If the district fails to meet the goals, the Education Department will recommend phasing out the junior and senior high schools, and either sending all junior high and new students to nearby districts that are willing to accept them, beginning in the fall of 2001, or opening a charter school in Roosevelt in the fall of 2002. The department must hold public hearings before closing down the Roosevelt schools.</p>
        <p>The coming school year is the last year of a six-year period of state oversight of the district, which began in 1995. In 1996, the Education Department, under special legislation, threw out the Roosevelt school board and appointed a special advisory panel to oversee the district until a new board was elected. But relations between the new board and the state advisory panel have been rocky, and the panel and the school system have labored under frequent turnover.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Mills said, the state has run out of alternatives. ''This is the last opportunity for Roosevelt to provide an appropriate education for the children and to demonstrate that by meeting reasonable performance targets,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While closing a school is not unprecedented -- the state has closed and reorganized several underperforming schools in New York City in recent years -- it would be highly unusual in a district like Roosevelt, which has only one middle school and one high school to serve the district's 3,000 students. And the school closures would mean a significant defeat for the state, which has been placing more and more failing schools on notice.</p>
        <p>One member of the Roosevelt school board said he believed the district will be able to meet the goals set by Mr. Mills. But Rodney Romain, the board member, said he was not sure how Roosevelt's citizens would react, given that many of them have been both unhappy with the school system and suspicious of outside reformers.</p>
        <p>The success of a plan to transfer students to other Long Island districts will rely heavily on the cooperation of those districts, which cannot be required by law to accept students from outside their borders. If the districts did accept the students, the Roosevelt Free Union School District would pay them tuition. This is likely to require financial assistance from the state, because Roosevelt spends about $1,000 less per student than other districts in Nassau County.</p>
        <p>Robert Johnson, the Board of Regents member representing Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island, said certain people in the community would oppose such a move.</p>
        <p>''You can bet your life that the politics of race are going to be very heavily involved in trying to prevent us from coming up with a plan that might be the best one,'' Mr. Johnson told the board during the meeting. ''We had better be prepared to deal with that head-on.''</p>
        <p>In an interview following the meeting, Mr. Johnson declined to say specifically who he thought would oppose the effort. ''But you only have to see how Roosevelt is organized to recognize that it has operated under de facto segregation for a long, long time,'' he said. For that reason, he added, he believes the Regents eventually will have to support a charter school or another alternative, promoted by some at the meeting, to build cooperative programs with local colleges to educate high school students.</p>
        <p>Martin Brooks, president of the Nassau County Council of School Superintendents and superintendent of the Valley Stream Central High School District, said in an interview that he believed that race would not affect the school districts' decisions on whether to accept Roosevelt students, but that available space and class size would.</p>
        <p>The surrounding districts of Uniondale, Baldwin, Freeport and Bellmore-Merrick would most likely  be asked to accept Roosevelt students, education officials said. If not enough space is available in these districts, others including East Meadow, West Hempstead, Rockville Center and Oceanside would be approached. Each junior and senior high school in those districts might be asked to make room for approximately 30 to 40 Roosevelt students, Mr. Mills said.</p>
        <p>If the students are dispersed, the Education Department might consider proposals to later reopen a reconstituted Roosevelt school, Mr. Mills said.</p>
        <p>While the education commissioner expressed confidence that the Roosevelt Board of Education would be able this year to meet his standards, some of which he has not yet specified, most members of the Regents were more skeptical. They asked the Education Department to begin contacting charter school companies, so that if the school district fails, a charter school could begin operation in the fall of 2001, rather than a year later.</p>
        <p>A charter school is already scheduled to open in Roosevelt in the fall, but it is intended to enroll students in the elementary grades.</p>
