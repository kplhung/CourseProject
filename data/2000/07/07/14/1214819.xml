        <p>The Yankees have added the slugger they needed and the pitcher they wanted to a core of stars already glittering with championship rings, and expectations are mounting exponentially. Joe Torre, the manager, says he is focused solely on making the playoffs, but admitted through a grin yesterday that there were those in the organization who wanted more.</p>
        <p>Winning the World Series has become the standard for the Yankees, and right now that seems a lofty goal for a team only six games over .500 -- a team whose signature trait this summer is inconsistency. Any emotional lift the Yankees might have derived from the trade for Denny Neagle was squandered in a brutal 11-9 loss to the persistent Florida Marlins at Yankee Stadium last night; Orlando Hernandez was hammered for eight runs, six of them coming on three-run homers by Mike Lowell and Derrek Lee.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, who will be without Shane Spencer for the rest of the year because of his right knee injury, may have lost second baseman Chuck Knoblauch for a few days. Knoblauch attempted to catch a vicious line drive hit by Preston Wilson in the seventh inning, and the ball smashed into the heel of his left hand, near his thumb -- the same area he has injured twice this year. Gene Monahan, the trainer, held Knoblauch's limp arm as the infielder walked off the field. X-rays did not reveal any fractures, but Knoblauch will undergo further tests today.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are 45-39 and still share first place in the American League East, because the Toronto Blue Jays lost to the Philadelphia Phillies, 8-5. The Yankees won seven of their last nine games before the All-Star Game break, a binge of success built on their pitching.</p>
        <p>But their pitching merely teased them last night. The Yankees trailed by five runs early, then six runs, then two runs, and every time, they kept coming back, patiently waiting out walks -- eight of them in all -- and putting themselves into a position where one very long hit would have tied the game.</p>
        <p>The bases were loaded and Florida led, 6-2, in the third inning when Tino Martinez smashed a long, high drive down the right-field line, his shot three decks high -- and foul, by about 5 feet. Martinez concluded a 10-pitch at-bat by popping out, and the inning ended with Ryan Thompson striking out.</p>
        <p>The Yankees were down, 10-4, in the seventh inning, and Florida relievers walked home two runs, bringing Scott Brosius to the plate as the potential tying run, the crowd of 33,324 murmuring with anticipation. With the count one ball and no strikes, Brosius looked for a pitch to drive, got the pitch he wanted -- and grounded to shortstop.</p>
        <p>The Marlins led, 11-6, in the eighth, and the Yankees scored three times  before Jorge Posada batted, representing the tying run. He popped out. Antonio Alfonseca struck out Derek Jeter to end the game with a runner at second. ''We did a real good job of battling back from deficits,'' Brosius said. ''We just couldn't keep them off the board.''</p>
        <p>The poor pitching began with Hernandez (8-7), from the start. Posada mentioned later that some players were helped by the All-Star Game break, their bodies needing the rest. But Hernandez was different, Posada said, -- he needs to be in a consistent regimen to maintain command of his pitches. When he falls out of that routine, ''he just isn't sharp,'' Posada said.</p>
        <p>And, almost a week removed from his last start, Hernandez was not sharp last night, his fastball sluggish in the first inning, when he seemed to loiter. Mark Kotsay singled with one out. While Cliff Floyd batted, Hernandez threw to first twice, faked another throw, stepped off the rubber, wiped his forehead a couple of times, and threw three straight fastballs out of the strike zone to fall behind, three balls and no strikes. Eventually, after Floyd fouled off a couple of pitches, Hernandez walked him. First and second and one out.</p>
        <p>Wilson hit a slow grounder in front of the mound, and after a moment's hesitation, Hernandez threw to second for the force play; it didn't appear that El Duque could have had a double play if he had reacted more quickly, although Hernandez appeared to gesture disgustedly afterward.</p>
        <p>The inning continued, and Hernandez threw an impotent fastball inside to Lowell, and Lowell -- a former Yankees prospect traded to the Marlins last year -- ripped a three-run homer, down the left-field line. Three runs down, very first inning.</p>
        <p>Wilson singled and stole second  with one out in the third inning, Hernandez walked Lowell on four pitches -- no fastballs this time, just sliders -- to bring Lee to the plate with runners at first and second. Hernandez threw his fastball, inside, but like his fastball to Lowell, not as far inside as he wanted. Lee destroyed it, hitting a homer to left. The score was 6-1. It was the 21st home run surrendered by Hernandez this year, the second most in the American League. The Yankees could never escape this huge hole. ''In a few words, they hit me,'' Hernandez said.</p>
        <p>If the Yankees played in the A.L. Central, they would be eight games out of first, just a little closer than that if they were in the A.L. West. Their record is only a few games better than the Cincinnati Reds', who have decided to sell off some parts and rebuild for next season. But the Yankees are still expected to play deep into October.</p>
        <p>''We've set the bar up pretty high,'' Torre said, ''and it's incumbent on us to keep it there.</p>
        <p>''Everybody knows what the goal is. My goal is always the postseason. People who work around here look beyond that.''</p>
        <p>It would be presumptuous for the Yankees to look past any team these days.</p>
