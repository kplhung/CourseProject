        <p>If the three artists from Bologna named Carracci -- Annibale (1560-1609), his brother Agostino (1557-1602) and their cousin Ludovico (1555-1619) -- didn't exactly invent Baroque art, they gave their all to it. In the 1580's, unhappy with the Mannerist preciosity that dominated the art of their time, they started an academy that pushed for a return to nature and the classical heritage of the great Italian masters who preceded them, in particular Correggio, Veronese and Titian.</p>
        <p>A significant institution in the history of Western art, essentially developed by Ludovico, the academy insisted that art can be taught on academic principles, along with more practical apprenticeships, and that pupils must study the antique and Renaissance traditions as well as anatomy and drawing from life. It produced a generation of artists, among them Guido Reni, Domenichino and Annibale Carracci himself.</p>
        <p>Later the three Carraccis went on to their own pursuits. Annibale, considered one of the greatest draftsmen of the age, moved to Rome in 1595 to work for the powerful Farnese family. With the help of Agostino, he created a highly influential fresco cycle for the ceiling of the Farnese Palace that was lauded as the equal of Raphael's work in the Vatican. Done in a vigorously sensuous style, it brought back the Renaissance love of human drama and emotion. Natural forms, modified by the classicism of the masters, replaced what the Carraccis perceived as the distortions of Mannerism. In short, they were significant figures in the development of the dynamic art known as Baroque.</p>
        <p>Over the last 30 years, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has assembled a splendid collection of work by the Carraccis: 4 paintings -- 3 acquired in the last 6 years -- 17 drawings and a slew of prints. A selection from these holdings is on display in ''The Birth of Baroque: The Carracci at the Metropolitan.''</p>
        <p>Among the oils, Ludovico's innovative ''The Lamentation'' (1582), said to be a landmark in European painting, is the most shockingly ''real.'' The very dead figure of Jesus, based on a posed model, lies contortedly across the matronly Virgin's lap as she slumps back in a faint. Light falls brightly on the two figures and the faces of St. John and Mary Magdalene, illuminating the contrast between live and dead flesh. The corpse's attendants, including the Virgin, are stylized compared with the figure of Jesus, but they avoid the idealization that was a given of Renaissance art.</p>
        <p>Less of a shocker, but of equal weight, is Annibale's ''Coronation of the Virgin'' (about 1596), done after his arrival in Rome for the private chapel of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini. The symmetrical composition shows the Virgin crowned Queen of Heaven by Jesus and God the Father as she is seated on a bank of clouds. She is attended below by a band of music-making cherubs seen close up and above by a ghostly cast of thousands in the infinity of Paradise. Scholars say that the compositional symmetry and the apselike view of Paradise reflect the classicism of Annibale's influential Roman style as well as his response to Raphael's Vatican frescoes.</p>
        <p>But brilliant as they are, these paintings can offer only a glimpse of the Carraccis' achievements, which ran mostly to complex fresco cycles and monumental altarpieces. Their painstaking observation and their ability to handle complicated narratives is better seen in their drawings and prints. The drawings, which served largely as a way to explore ideas, were fundamental to the making of the Carracci pictorial language. They range from Annibale's charmingly intimate ink with wash, ''A Domestic Scene'' (probably early 1580's), in which a mother warms her child's nightgown before a fire, to Ludovico's ambitious ''The Last Communion of St. Jerome'' (no date), a tightly composed altarpiece proposal for a Bolognese church in which the saint undergoes the sacramental rite as he lies supported by Mary, among a bustle of other figures.</p>
        <p>Among them are powerful figure studies, like Annibale's ''Triton Sounding a Conch Shell'' (probably around 1597), one of the many preparatory drawings for the Farnese Palace project. It depicts a hugely  muscled sea god blowing strenuously on a conch shell, the finished version of which appears in the ceiling fresco ''Thetis Carried to the Bridal Chamber of Peleus.'' Most of the energetic figures for the gigantic fresco cycle were invented by Annibale (although some were done by Agostino) using poses by live models. At least 90 drawings for the project are extant.</p>
        <p>Annibale's drawings include biblical themes as well. One of the loveliest is the ink and wash ''Landscape With Jacob Sleeping'' (probably 1590-1595), relating to the story in Genesis. During a journey, Jacob, the future patriarch, falls asleep on a heap of stones. He dreams of a ladder to Heaven, with people climbing and descending and God speaking from the top about the Promised Land. In Annibale's version, the huddled figure of Jacob lies under a sheltering tree, while in the middle distance a faintly sketched ladder is seen. The pastoral landscape is airy and luminous, with a glowingly expansive rendering of space.</p>
        <p>Agostino was the only Carracci trained as a professional printmaker, although his brother and cousin did not lack for skills in the medium. The more than 200 engravings by Agostino include many that reproduced the endeavors of earlier masters like Titian and Tintoretto, helping to spread knowledge of their work. Annibale, taught by Agostino, made only 21 prints over a 25-year period, starting in 1581 with engraving but going on to the livelier challenge of etching. Only four prints by Ludovico are known.</p>
        <p>One of Annibale's most dramatic prints, combining etching and engraving, deals with the biblical tale ''Susanna and the Elders'' (circa  1590-92), in which a fleshy Susanna is spied on at her bath by two dirty old men. She hastily pulls her clothes around her in a beautifully delineated milieu of sun, lush vegetation, drapery, water and the stone of the bathing pool. The menace of the two men is heightened by frowning stone masks at the edge of the pool. The action in a much smaller ''Susanna'' engraving by Agostino, done around the same time, is more lascivious; it drew a rebuke from Pope Clement VIII. In this print one of the elders actually gropes her.</p>
        <p>Two strong renditions of saints by Agostino also stand out among the prints. ''The Stigmatization of St. Francis'' (published 1586) is an arresting engraving of the saint in the wilderness, kneeling in ecstasy, hands outstretched to receive the stigmata conveyed by rays from above. The work of several other artists influenced this print, but Agostino's intense, theatrical depiction of the saint's ecstatic expression shows how he embraced the Baroque style.</p>
        <p>His last engraving, done shortly before his death and finished by another artist, is ''Saint Jerome'' (1602). The saint, attended by a sleeping lion, kneels on a rock, holding a cross and gazing rapturously upward. In this print Agostino looks more to Mannerism, expressed in the saint's well-muscled body.</p>
        <p>This small but illustrious show is another example of the Met's commendable practice of building exhibitions from its own collection with little or no call on outside sources. Admittedly not every museum can muster the material owned by this treasure house, but the Met has become adept at proving that there are more ways than blockbusters to get people looking at art.</p>
        <p>''The Birth of Baroque: The Carracci at the Metropolitan'' remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Sept. 17.</p>
