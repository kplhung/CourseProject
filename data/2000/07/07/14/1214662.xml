        <p>William Grimes Diner's Journal review of Larry Forgione's Restaurant Above, on 21st floor of new Times Square Hilton; photo (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Larry Forgione is synonymous with American cuisine. But at Restaurant Above, on the 21st floor of the new Times Square Hilton, he has taken a lurching detour into the land of fusion. Mr. Forgione developed the Asian-influenced menu with his partner Jonathan Waxman and the restaurant's two chefs, Kazuto Matsusaka and Vicki Fan Matsusaka, a married couple both from California. Mr. Matsusaka worked for many years at Chinois on Main in Santa Monica. Ms. Matsusaka cooked at JiRaffe and Buddha Bar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forgione leaves some tell-tale traces, as in an appetizer of fried Ipswich clams, a longtime signature but this time Easternized with a tartar sauce sharpened up with yuzu. Boneless barbecue pork rib with a grits cake sounds all-American, but the kumquat barbecue sauce has an Asian tinge. Soft Asian tacos with barbecued duck and ginger plum sauce straddle at least a couple of continents, but in the world-traveler competition they lag well behind another appetizer, grilled sardine sushi on Himalayan red rice with ginger scallion pesto.</p>

        <p>Larry Forgione is synonymous with American cuisine. But at Restaurant Above, on the 21st floor of the new Times Square Hilton, he has taken a lurching detour into the land of fusion. Mr. Forgione developed the Asian-influenced menu with his partner Jonathan Waxman and the restaurant's two chefs, Kazuto Matsusaka and Vicki Fan Matsusaka, a married couple both from California. Mr. Matsusaka worked for many years at Chinois on Main in Santa Monica. Ms. Matsusaka cooked at JiRaffe and Buddha Bar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forgione leaves some tell-tale traces, as in an appetizer of fried Ipswich clams, a longtime signature but this time Easternized with a tartar sauce sharpened up with yuzu. Boneless barbecue pork rib with a grits cake sounds all-American, but the kumquat barbecue sauce has an Asian tinge. Soft Asian tacos with barbecued duck and ginger plum sauce straddle at least a couple of continents, but in the world-traveler competition they lag well behind another appetizer, grilled sardine sushi on Himalayan red rice with ginger scallion pesto.</p>
        <p>Above swings freely, sometimes wildly, and the menu includes a fair share of overproduced duds. For every dish like the lettuce wrap with a lush, sweet-hot filling of spicy spring lamb, there's a garbled offering like tempura-style soft-shell crabs on soba noodles with poblano-cilantro sauce.</p>
        <p>Will it be black-tea-smoked pork tenderloin with apricot salsa, onion rings and Thai red curry sauce, or sesame-crusted yellowfin tuna with baby bok choy shoots, vermicelli noodles and Banyuls-ponzu sauce? Are you feeling lucky?</p>
        <p>Appetizers are listed as ''small plates,'' and the waiters, insisting that they are too small to stand alone as first courses, encourage multiple tastings. I found many of the small plates to be pretty large. But then the clientele at the Hilton may be used to Midwestern portions.</p>
        <p>Two desserts are worth saving room for. Ginger shortcake with sauteed peaches, cherries and vanilla cream makes the case that East and West can meet. And the chocolate and espresso ganache tart with macadamia nut brittle is a delirious trip into the heart of darkness.</p>
        <p>You won't be able to move for several minutes after eating it, so allow extra time.</p>
        <p>Restaurant Above, 234 West 42nd Street, Manhattan; (212) 642-2626. Dinner entrees, $24 to $29.</p>
