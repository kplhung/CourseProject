        <p>Leaders of the Episcopal Church reached agreement today on an unusual resolution about human sexuality, in which the church officially acknowledged that its parishioners include unmarried couples living in long-term relationships and that those relationships are worthy of pastoral care.</p>
        <p>The resolution makes no distinction between heterosexual and homosexual relationships, but the church leaders focused almost entirely on its use in acknowledging long-term relationships among gay and lesbian Episcopalians.</p>
        <p>The resolution, approved by the church's bishops in a lopsided vote of 119 to 19, with 4 bishops abstaining, said the church expects long-term relationships among unmarried couples to be monogamous and characterized by ''mutual affection and respect.'' It condemns promiscuity and notes the church's traditional teaching on the sanctity of marriage.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week the resolution was approved by clergy and lay representatives at the denomination's General Convention, its top policy-making body, whose meeting at the Denver Convention Center ends on Friday. The convention, which meets every three years, is divided into two chambers, a House of Deputies, with clergy and lay people, and a House of Bishops. For any measure to become church law or policy, it must be approved by both houses.</p>
        <p>But even as the bishops approved the resolution on sexuality, a new debate erupted among the clergy and lay people concerning an older issue, the ordination of women as priests.</p>
        <p>The topic specifically addressed the reluctance of two of the church's 106 dioceses, its regional jurisdictions, to perform such ordinations. Episcopalians began ordaining women in the 1970's, but some dioceses did not do so for years. In the mid-1990's, impatient with the slowness of a few holdouts, the convention approved a law that no diocese could refuse to ordain a candidate for the priesthood on the basis of sex.</p>
        <p>Still, the dioceses of Fort Worth and Quincy, Ill., have not ordained women, prompting a majority of clergy and lay representatives at the convention today to pass a resolution that would set up a task force to ''assist'' the two dioceses -- as well as the diocese of San Joaquin, Calif., which only recently began ordaining women -- in complying with the church law.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the Rev. Charles Hough III of Fort Worth said he objected to the resolution's intention on the ground that opponents of women's ordination were ''being asked to deny what we believe.''</p>
        <p>But Katie Sherrod, a Fort Worth resident and member of the Episcopal Women's Caucus, a group that supports women's ordination, said the reluctance of the diocese to embrace woman as priests had led some families not to have their daughters confirmed in the Episcopal Church. ''I do feel we need the ministry of female priests in our diocese,'' she said.</p>
