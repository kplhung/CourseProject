        <p>WHEN two Jets players recently saw each other at a charity event, they exchanged the usual pleasantries. Can't believe the season is here already, how are the wife and kids, my golf game is horrible, blah, blah, blah. Then there was a pause. They drew closer so no one else could hear.</p>
        <p>''Speak to coach recently?'' one asked.</p>
        <p>The other player smiled and said: ''Which one? The big coach or the little coach?''</p>
        <p>The big coach they were referring to was Bill Parcells; the little one was Al Groh. The harsh joke was not lost. Groh is the head coach and Parcells is the general manager. Yet to these two Jets players -- and probably many others on the team -- Parcells is still seen as both. Groh may hold the title, but Parcells is still the boss, Jets players believe, on and off the field.</p>
        <p>As the Jets' training camp practices begin today, Groh's biggest challenge is not finding a replacement for wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson or depth for the offensive line. Groh must immediately get the team to believe in him, to follow him, and he must draw the players' collective dreamy gaze away from Parcells. In short, Groh must become a leader, not the football equivalent of Mini-Me.</p>
        <p>Groh is in an impossible situation. He is replacing a legend, and National Football League history is riddled with the remains of men who have tried to follow great coaches. Two died slow football deaths trying to fit into the large pants of Parcells. Ray Handley was fired after just two seasons as coach of the Giants, and Pete Carroll spent most of his brief head coaching career in New England trying to show he could be as tough as Parcells.</p>
        <p>One of the few postlegend success stories in league history is George Seifert, who followed Bill Walsh in San Francisco. Walsh won three Super Bowls and had a 102-63-1 record, but Seifert went 108-35 and captured two championships, proving to be one of the great coaches of the last decade. But he was never fully appreciated by the fans or the news media because he followed a Hall of Famer.</p>
        <p>''Any time you follow a great coach, there is a sense that no matter what you do, it's not quite good enough,'' Seifert said. ''Al is entering a situation that was identical to mine. Bill Parcells is revered. Al will see some of what I saw, like, 'What would Walsh have done on third-and-4?' But I doubt Al will be deterred. Ultimately your job is not to become an idol but win football games.''</p>
        <p>If Groh wins, if he goes to a Super Bowl, Parcells will get much of the credit because he built the team. If the Jets lose, Groh will be blamed and knucklehead fans will call in to the talk shows and ask for Parcells to return and coach.</p>
        <p>Part of me thinks Parcells likes being in this position. He can hover, delegate and make personnel decisions, fulfilling his grand ego. If things go badly, he is still distant enough so blame won't touch him and close enough to hear a clamor for his return.</p>
        <p>Even now Parcells roams the hallways of the Jets' complex in Hempstead, N.Y., still schmoozing with players, still occasionally yelling at people, still threatening agents if they talk too much to the news media. In other words, Parcells remains in total control.</p>
        <p>This is having the predictable effect. Players privately maintain they are confused by the situation. Is Groh truly the one making the decisions? Or is Parcells, never shy at manipulating a situation or people, the real leader, waiting for an opportunity to return to the sideline? The idea of Parcells as closet coach grew when he spent considerable time on the field in spring practices, often huddling with individual players. Anyone who thinks that does not undermine Groh is being silly.</p>
        <p>''When I was first hired in San Francisco, Bill Walsh stayed around for two months, and then he left for television,'' Seifert said. ''When he left, it was the best thing to happen to me, because it allowed me to become a head coach. I don't say that negatively, it is just human nature. What is that saying, too many cooks in the kitchen?''</p>
        <p>If the shadow of Parcells continues to loom large, it will hurt Groh in the locker room, where it counts the most. Players are smart. They watch and hear everything. If they even get a whiff that Groh is some sort of Parcells puppet, they will tune out everything he has to say.</p>
        <p>That, of course, would be a very bad thing.</p>
