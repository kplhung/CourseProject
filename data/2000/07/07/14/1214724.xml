        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said today that his campaign had begun ''serious vetting'' of the financial and medical records of the top candidates to be his running mate, and he said he did not intend to run the finalists through a public interview process.</p>
        <p>''There's something I can do to bring some order and privacy to the process,'' Mr. Bush told reporters on his campaign plane. ''It doesn't suit my style to say, 'Hey, so and so's coming in,' and have the person have to walk through a bunch of reporters to have the discussion.''</p>

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said today that his campaign had begun ''serious vetting'' of the financial and medical records of the top candidates to be his running mate, and he said he did not intend to run the finalists through a public interview process.</p>
        <p>''There's something I can do to bring some order and privacy to the process,'' Mr. Bush told reporters on his campaign plane. ''It doesn't suit my style to say, 'Hey, so and so's coming in,' and have the person have to walk through a bunch of reporters to have the discussion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said only his wife and Richard B. Cheney, the former Congressman at the head of his search process, knew his thinking on the issue. He said he had learned the dangers of being too public from watching his father select Dan Quayle. He said that since ''everybody knew'' who was on George Bush's short list, it was easy for Mr. Quayle's selection to leak out.</p>
        <p>With the Republican National Convention little more than two weeks away, speculation has been mounting and Mr. Bush received a barrage of questions at a news conference here on whether he would select Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who was at his side. ''I'm not telling you,'' he replied. Many Republicans believe Mr. Ridge's choice is unlikely because his support for abortion rights would create a storm among conservatives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush had some rare praise for his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, naming him, along with Walter F. Mondale, Mr. Quayle, and his own father as recent vice presidents who had all served their presidents well.</p>
        <p>''All of them have been very good vice presidents,'' he said. ''All of them were assigned specific tasks. All of them gave counsel to their presidents and all of them did a very good job at keeping their counsel private.''</p>
        <p>The Texas governor also said that Mr. Gore was a forceful debater. But Mr. Bush was soon back to jabbing at Mr. Gore over his campaign style and fighting with him over the state of the Texas budget.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also unveiled a proposal for a $75 million five-year program of grants to community groups to use veterans as mentors and role models in programs for children.</p>
