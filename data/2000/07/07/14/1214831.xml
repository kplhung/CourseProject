        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A July 9 news article discusses the large profits of pharmaceutical companies. Pfizer Inc., you point out, has a patent on a drug used to treat cryptococcal meningitis, which can be a complication of AIDS. We must remember, however, the large investments that companies make in developing new drugs. It can easily take 10 years to research, develop and test a new drug, and often these efforts do not lead to a marketable product.</p>

        <p>If companies cannot make money on the sale of successful drugs, then no new ones can be developed. That would be a catastrophe for us, and also for the countries that copy these drugs without having to invest any money in their development.</p>
