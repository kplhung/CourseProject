        <p>Captain Dad, weeping, returned from exile yesterday. He donned the sweater with the magic ''C'' and promised to lead his lost comrades out of their despair. It was yet another turn in the hero's journey of a legendary old warrior.</p>
        <p>Right. With a $9 million signing bonus.</p>
        <p>Wait a minute. This is Mark Messier we're talking about, the man the Beast calls the Messiah, the Frozen Chosen, the man who came out of the heart of the great glowing West nine years ago and led the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup in 54 years.</p>
        <p>That was then; we dumped Messier three years ago because he was over and we needed to rebuild.</p>
        <p>Get smart. Messier was let go to Vancouver three years ago because Wayne Gretzky didn't think New York was big enough for both of them, and with the Great's face outside the Official All-Star Cafe in Times Square, there was no place for a better veteran player.</p>
        <p>Wise up yourself. Messier is back now because the new president of the club, Glen Sather, is the man who signed him at 17 and who would love to see him star again at 40. Might make Sather young again.</p>
        <p>So there you have it. A clear choice. Did the Rangers make a sentimental pitch for season-ticket sales or did they buy into a myth that can revive a sagging franchise?  Only a fool would care. Messier is back. Hockey is a hard, cold, rough game, and he brings a fire to it that warms a building in winter.</p>
        <p>There is no one else in all of sport who could promise to lead his team to the playoffs -- ''I can lead them, not carry them; I believe in victory by committee,'' he said yesterday -- and then add, ''Half the fun is the journey, the blood, sweat and tears of getting there,'' without most of the audience switching to ''Big Brother.'' Messier is reality programming with old-fashioned values, Harry Potter with a slap shot.</p>
        <p>What else is there these days? The Knicks ended their season in disarray, still clogged in the middle. The Yankees and the Mets turned sour together when Mike Piazza was beaned by a pitch from Roger Clemens, who should never have become a Yankee in place of David Wells. The Giants and Jets start soon, I guess, and who is playing quarterback? Which drug company is the proud sponsor of the Olympics?</p>
        <p>But sometime this fall, the Zamboni will roar and the Beast will writhe in the upper seats crying, ''We want the cup!'' There will be hope this season in that roar because Messier will be skating below them, his sneaky stick chopping under the referees' radar, his shotgun eyes seeking the frayed edges of the other team's resolve.</p>
        <p>See, this is what the man can do even to me. Yesterday, he cried and he cried, stopping only to say, ''I've embarrassed myself in front of millions,'' with the cool assurance of one who knows that so long as millions are watching, tears are totally acceptable. It's crying alone that's tough.</p>
        <p>Millionaires don't cry alone. His dad, Doug, negotiated his new contract with Sather, who sent the 18-year-old Messier out to protect the 19-year-old Gretzky's back. They created the Oilers dynasty together. Messier came to New York in 1991, in part -- though he denies it -- to lead a team of his own. He was instrumental in having the coach dumped and in inspiring three terrific young players: Adam Graves, who did for him what he had done for Gretzky; Mike Richter, the goalie; and Brian Leetch, the superb defenseman who took over the captaincy when Messier left acrimoniously three years ago.</p>
        <p>That leaving is being conveniently blamed on Neil Smith, the former president and general manager, who had brought in Messier in the first place, so that we can all go into the future together smiling.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Richter and Graves spoke reverently about Messier's skills on the ice and his presence in the locker room as a leader. They were children when they first played with him; one wonders if they have matured out of his grasp. Sather says he will depend on the new coach, Ron Low, to lead from the outside while Messier leads from within. In a room someday without the coach, Sather said, Messier or ''someone he has influenced'' will say something to the team when it needs to be set aright.</p>
        <p>Leetch, a reserved man, seemed almost giddy yesterday, as if the captain's ''C'' had been a crushing burden. He was happy it was now where it belonged.</p>
        <p>''Mark's role almost in life is to help others become better,'' he said. ''I was shocked when Mark left. I loved to see him take the face-offs in big moments.'' He almost started smiling, this self-contained man, and then he said, ''The fans will be excited, that's for sure.''</p>
