        <p>CANADA: WARMING TO NORTH KOREA -- A senior Canadian diplomat visiting North Korea plans to brief Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy on her visit tomorrow, and Mr. Axworthy plans to discuss relations with North Korea's foreign minister, Paek Nam Sun, this month. Asked if the visit of Margaret Huber, the senior diplomat, means Canada is moving to normalizing ties, Mr. Axworthy said: ''We're certainly on that track. We're going to take it step by step.''</p>

        <p>CANADA: ABORTION ALERT -- The police have heightened security around Vancouver abortion providers after a doctor coordinating clinical trials of an abortion drug received a death threat. The telephoned threat to Dr. Ellen Wiebe came four days after she announced her trials of a French drug. Separately, Garson Romalis, the Vancouver abortion doctor stabbed in the back on Tuesday, is recovering, under police protection, at a local hospital.</p>

        <p>HAITI: U.S. WARNING -- The United States warned Haiti that it risked losing international aid if it did not quickly correct the flaws of its recent elections. Haiti held parliamentary and municipal elections on May 21 in which observers said tainted results in Senate races had favored Lavalas, the political party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Turnout was very low in a second round of voting on Sunday.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: ORANGEMEN URGE PROTEST -- Portadown Orangemen called for renewed province-wide protests against the decision denying them the right to parade through a Catholic neighborhood near Drumcree church despite widespread criticism from fellow Protestants of their earlier request to ''take to the streets'' and the nights of violence that followed. The Royal Ulster Constabulary issued figures showing that over 10 days there were 329 attacks on the police and army, leaving 81 officers and 6 soldiers injured, 305 firebomb incidents, 105 vehicles hijacked and 404 others burned, and 174 buildings damaged.</p>

        <p>CORSICA: WARNING FROM PARIS -- French officials have warned Corsican politicians that they may be asking for too much in their negotiations for more independence from Paris. The Corsican legislature rejected an offer from Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who offered the island unprecedented rights, including limited powers to modify laws voted in Paris. ''I hope that the Corsican representatives will be wise enough not to go beyond what the Republic can do today,'' said France's agriculture minister, Jean Glavany, who has close dealings with Corsica.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: HEAT WAVE HEALTH RISKS -- Government offices across Turkey were ordered shut down for two days by the health ministry in response to a record heat wave across the country. The offices were closed to reduce health risks and lessen demands on power supplies as temperatures topped 100 degrees in many areas and were reported up to 114 degrees in the southeast in a second week of blistering temperatures. In Istanbul, authorities cautioned people to remain indoors from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: SYNAGOGUE BOMBERS JAILED -- Two teenagers who threw gasoline bombs at a synagogue in eastern Germany on Hitler's birthday were convicted and sentenced to prison, a verdict meant to show that Germany takes combating far-right violence seriously. Andreas John, 18, drew a three-year term and Carsten Haag, 17, received over two years. They confessed to throwing beer bottles filled with oil at the building on the night of April 20, saying they wanted to show ''Nazism is still alive.''</p>

        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: CORRUPTION ATTACK -- Attacking corruption in the governing party, President Thabo Mbeki warned there was no place for those who joined the African National Congress in hopes of improving their positions and wealth.
