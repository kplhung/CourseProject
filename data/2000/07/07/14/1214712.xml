        <p>Cuomo Can Still Turn Up the Heat</p>

        <p>Cuomo Can Still Turn Up the Heat</p>
        <p>MARIO M. CUOMO has long had a reputation as a fiery speechmaker. Yesterday, he was a fiery-speech maker. His notes went up in flames during a speech titled ''The Soul of the Profession: Thoughts on Being a Lawyer.''</p>
        <p>''It's what I get for becoming a lawyer again,'' Mr. Cuomo, who was governor of New York from 1982 to 1994 and is now a partner at Willkie, Farr &amp; Gallagher, said after putting out the fire himself. He was not injured.</p>
        <p>He had prepared the incendiary remarks for a breakfast meeting at the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, on West 44th Street near the Avenue of the Americas. The New York Law Journal and the bar association had organized the session and had invited young lawyers and summer associates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo was blazing along when he realized his typed notes were ablaze -- or at least smoking.</p>
        <p>''The smoke begins to smell like real smoke from a real fire,'' Mr. Cuomo said, switching to the present tense when he told the story later in the day. ''All of a sudden, it gets heavier and small traces of flame appear. Then, a real flame. I hold up the pages. I say, 'Let all of you in the room record that my words burst into flame.' ''</p>
        <p>Can a lawyer without a hose or a helmet play firefighter? Apparently so. Mr. Cuomo put the burning pages on a table and pounded out the flames with his fist. He said that there was no obvious cause for the fire, though the lamp on the lectern was a likely culprit.</p>
        <p>Was there a message in the fire?</p>
        <p>''Let's hope it's not the obvious one,'' he said. ''Anything to do with flames, especially if you're a pre-Vatican II Council Catholic, that's not a good sign. There are only two possibilities: the burning bush or the other burning place.''</p>
        <p>Fun Beyond The Beltway</p>
        <p>The question was: Has it come to this?</p>
        <p>''I'm here with four Playboy bunnies in a car,'' JAMES CARVILLE, the limelight-loving Democratic consultant, said from somewhere in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Once he was the campaign manager for Bill Clinton. Now he is the campaign manager for Captain Morgan, the long-haired seafarer pictured on bottles of spiced rum. (At parties like the one Mr. Carville was on the way to, at the penthouse in the Fifth Avenue building where Playboy has its offices, an actor plays the captain. So far, the captain is not on the ballot anywhere.)</p>
        <p>''What happened was, they did an event in Washington,'' Mr. Carville said, referring to the rum makers. ''They said, 'Hey, that worked out well, let's do one in New York.' I come in and do spot events. The idea is to poke fun at everything.''</p>
        <p>But doesn't he risk losing credibility by playing a part in such stunts? ''Anything in America, a few people could take the wrong way,'' he said. ''That whole thing is a whole huge spoof. The idea is to have a little fun. Any time I can't have a little fun, it's just not worth it.''</p>
        <p>Palatable Across Party Lines</p>
        <p>HOWARD WOLFSON, the chief spokesman for Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign, and MIKE MURPHY, the chief strategist for Representative Rick A. Lazio's campaign, have found something they agree on in New York: restaurants. Or, more precisely, a restaurant.</p>
        <p>Independently of each other, Mr. Wolfson and Mr. Murphy have both proclaimed Shun Lee West, at 43 West 65th Street, near Lincoln Center, to be their favorite place for dinner in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy, who lives in Virginia, ate there on Tuesday night. Mr. Wolfson, who lives on the Upper East Side,  ate there on Wednesday night. They have yet to cross paths there, though that seems to be just a matter of time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfson offered a challenge to his counterpart: dinner at Shun Lee West on the night after the election, with the losing candidate picking up the tab.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy, who learned of Mr. Wolfson's restaurant preference over dinner at -- where else? -- Shun Lee West, jumped at Mr. Wolfson's offer, anticipating, no doubt, a free meal come November. ''Tell him the only grease I want is on the egg rolls -- none of his slippery quotes,'' Mr. Murphy said, laughing. ''The maitre d' better have a first aid kit ready.''</p>
