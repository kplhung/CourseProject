      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Sandra Bernhard is the queen of ambivalence. A fashion maven who excoriates Seventh Avenue, a worshiper at the altar of fame who tosses poisoned darts at celebrities, she is a stage chameleon who from moment to moment swings between poles of beautiful and ugly, feminine and masculine, tender and vicious. In her monologues, the lines between reality and fantasy are blurred to the point that you begin to wonder if even she knows the difference between the two. (She does.) When she sings in a two-tiered voice that has several layers of affectation, it's often hard to tell whether she's putting us on or whether she envisages herself as a combination of Dusty Springfield and Janis Joplin, two singers to whom she pays tribute in her fascinating new cabaret show, ''Songs I Sang on the Kibbutz.''</p>
        <p>That show, which plays at Joe's Pub through July 26, is similar to her recent Off Broadway and Broadway turn, ''I'm Still Here . . . Damn It!'' except that it is cabaret-length (a little over an hour) and musically oriented. Working with a flexible rock band, Ms. Bernhard delivers a wildly ambitious program that includes a couple of originals alongside  songs like ''Downtown Train,'' ''Windmills of Your Mind,'' and ''Get It While You Can.'' The show ends with an elongated version of the Rolling Stones' ''Salt of the Earth'' to which she has appended a quasi-rap coda in which she exhorts both herself and the audience not to be ''a slave to mediocrity'' and the values of mass culture and to embrace  something more authentic.</p>

        <p>But what makes Ms. Bernhard so compelling isn't any message. It's the honesty with which she deconstructs her narcissism, presenting herself as an audience surrogate and test case of someone corrupted by celebrity culture. If she can't really sing (and probably knows it), she makes up for it in nerve and attitude. She is the eternal teenager in us all in front of the mirror, pretending  to be Elvis or Mick Jagger or Janis Joplin and almost bringing it off.</p>
