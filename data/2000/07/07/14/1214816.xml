        <p>There was nothing unusual about it, Melvin Mora insisted. The Mets shortstop said he should have turned a game-ending double play tonight against the Boston Red Sox on Jose Offerman's hard-hit bouncer in the ninth inning. But Mora rushed himself, took his eye off the ball as the pinch-runner Manny Alexander approached second, and bobbled the grounder.</p>
        <p>Armando Benitez, who was pitching, counseled Mora, telling him not to worry about it. Mora told Benitez he was fine, and eager for another chance.</p>
        <p>''That's what I think when I make an error,'' Mora said. ''Give me another one and I'm going to turn it.''</p>
        <p>The opportunity never came. Jeff Frye flied to center for the second out of the ninth, and a 1-2 pitch to Brian Daubach just missed being called a strike to end the game. Then Daubach lined a low fastball down the right-field line.</p>
        <p>Right fielder Derek Bell thought one of three things would happen: the ball would bounce over the short fence for a ground-rule double; it would bounce high and carom back to him; or it would bounce low and stay near the wall. Bell hung back and waited for the carom, but it never came. The ball stayed near the wall and Bell scampered after it, but Offerman scored the winning run in a 4-3 Red Sox victory.</p>
        <p>''It really hurts,'' said Mets catcher Mike Piazza, who went 1 for 4 and caught the whole game in his first game since suffering a concussion when he was beaned by Roger Clemens on Saturday. ''These types of losses do hurt pretty badly.''</p>
        <p>The Mets had a chance to win a game started by Pedro Martinez, the best pitcher in the American League. Martinez struck out 10 in seven innings but was victimized twice by Jay Payton and left with the score tied, 2-2. The Mets also wasted another solid effort by Bobby J. Jones. But Mora may have been hurt worst of all; he said he felt responsible for the loss. The error was only his fifth in 33 games at shortstop. The Gold Glove winner he replaced at shortstop, the injured Rey Ordonez, had six errors in 45 games.</p>
        <p>''He's playing just the way Rey played this year,'' said Mets Manager Bobby Valentine, who said Offerman's hit had sliced and was hardly routine.</p>
        <p>''His errors have been the same per game that Rey had. If we're going to give him a full-page story every time he makes an error, then we've got to give him a full-page story every time he helps the team win.''</p>
        <p>The error would have been an afterthought if Benitez's penultimate pitch had been called a strike. Daubach was asked if he could have done anything with the pitch.</p>
        <p>''Nothing -- I would have struck out,'' Daubach said. ''I wouldn't have been surprised if he called it. There were a few high pitches that were called for strikes. It was close.''</p>
        <p>Daubach took advantage of his new life and gave the Red Sox their first victory this season when trailing entering the ninth inning. In the process, he put the spotlight on Mora's misplay -- and on the absence of Ordonez, who has sometimes been forgotten because of Mora's superior offensive ability.</p>
        <p>''Some people are going to think if Rey was there, he would have got the ball,'' Mora said. ''But I do my best. It's not the first error or the last one. But now, I feel sad. We could have had that game. Benitez threw pretty good, everybody threw good. Then one error, we change the whole score.''</p>
        <p>Benitez (2-4) was the fourth Mets pitcher, and the first three were impressive. Jones worked six innings, allowing two runs and striking out eight to tie his season high. Dennis Cook looked dominant in a 1-2-3 seventh, striking out two, and John Franco pitched a scoreless eighth.</p>
        <p>Those pitchers were helped along by fine defense. Payton chased down a potentially troubling fly ball by Nomar Garciaparra to end a scoreless fifth inning with the bases loaded. Todd Zeile dived to his left to spear a hard grounder by Troy O'Leary, tossing to Franco for the out and saving a run to preserve a 3-2 Mets lead in the eighth.</p>
        <p>Payton and Zeile helped build that lead. Martinez set down the first five batters of the game, but Zeile doubled to the warning track in left-center. Payton was up next, and in his first career at-bat against Martinez, he doubled down the left-field line, scoring Zeile to give the Mets a 1-0 lead in the second.</p>
        <p>After striking out on a curveball in his second at-bat, Payton lifted a fastball over the Green Monster in the seventh, tying the score.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>BOBBY JONES has a 2.73 earned run average in five starts since his brief assignment to Class AAA Norfolk. . . . BOBBY VALENTINE said he would try to slot RICK REED to make his next start on Monday in Toronto, and Reed is all for that. The right-hander, who is on the disabled list with a broken left wrist, threw about 40 pitches yesterday. He can catch with his glove hand and his strained calf has improved. ''I've done everything that I can possibly do,'' Reed said. ''Just got to get the clearance.'' . . . The Mets looked into trading for DENNY NEAGLE, the club's assistant general manager, JIM DUQUETTE, said, and they considered him the best starting pitcher available. But the Mets could not match the Yankees' offer of four prospects. . . . RICH RODRIGUEZ rejoined the Mets after five games at Class AAA Norfolk, where he added a changeup with movement. Rodriguez, who has been mainly a mop-up reliever, said he would no longer be bothered by how he was used. ''That was my biggest problem,'' he said.</p>
