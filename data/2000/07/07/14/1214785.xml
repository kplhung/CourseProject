        <p>Uncertainty surrounds the future of Lothar Matthaus with the MetroStars and Major League Soccer. Matthaus met with Nick Sakiewicz, the general manager, and Coach Octavio Zambrano at the team's office yesterday to explain why he spent time in St. Tropez, France, last week at a time he was supposed to be rehabilitating his injured back.</p>
        <p>''He told us his side of the story,'' Sakiewicz said. ''We both expressed our feelings on this and we'll discuss his future by next Wednesday.''</p>
        <p>Sakiewicz didn't sound enthusiastic about wanting Matthaus at this stage because the MetroStars have done extremely well without him. The team, which finished with the worst record in the league last season, is in first place. Some people within the MetroStars believe that Matthaus may upset the team's chemistry if he returns.</p>
        <p>A league official speaking on the condition of anonymity said that the MetroStars do not want Matthaus, who, like every player in the league, had his contract guaranteed for the rest of the season on July 1.</p>
        <p>Among the options the league, which owns all the players' contracts, and the MetroStars have is waiving Matthaus, selling his contract to an overseas team, buying out his contract or having him stay with the MetroStars.</p>
        <p>Sakiewicz said the injured Matthaus will not travel to Boston today for tomorrow's game against the Revolution. The MetroStars will also face the Revolution without Tab Ramos and Clint Mathis, who are both with the United States national team for the World Cup qualifier on Sunday in Guatemala.</p>
