        <p>'TaiGong Fishing, Willing to Bite the Bait'  Jack Tilton Gallery  49 Greene Street  SoHo  Through July 29</p>
        <p>Chinese-born and Paris-based, Huang Yong Ping has made previous appearances in New York, notably on a Hugo Boss Prize short list at the Guggenheim. But his second Tilton solo is his best work here so far.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huang, 45, was an important figure in China's embattled vanguard art movement of the 1980's. A 1987 piece in which he put two art history books -- one of Chinese painting, the other of Western modernism -- through a washing machine cycle, blending them into mush, not only established his Duchampian credentials but also opened up new channels to colleagues until then confined to recycling the conventions of Socialist Realism.</p>
        <p>Since then his work has taken the form of large-scale and ever more elegantly crafted installations. The one at Tilton is based on a Chinese legend of a man who went fishing every day for years without using bait. He caught nothing, but behind his apparently whimsical behavior he patiently hatched a plot for political vengeance, which he was eventually able to carry out.</p>
        <p>Props related to the narrative fill the main gallery. A vermilion chair is set high on a wall; a slender fishing rod extends out over a net festooned with lures. But ultimately the hows and whys of the specific story seem to matter less than the atmosphere of mystery generated by this piece and others: a set of copper pans is suspended like scales from the ceiling, and a world globe with a hinged lid has live insects and little animals, all poisonous, inside. Photographs and watercolor maps further enrich a show that finds an interesting artist refining his forms and complicating his ideas as he approaches mid-career.</p>
