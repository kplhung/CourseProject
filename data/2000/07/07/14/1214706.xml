        <p>THE Ford Motor Company figures it has too much cash on its hands and thinks its shares are undervalued. So it plans to distribute $10 billion to its owners.</p>
        <p>So far so good. If Ford were a normal company, it would simply declare a special dividend or buy back a lot of shares. Instead, it is undertaking a bizarrely complicated transaction that calls for Ford to be acquired by another company, known as the Ford Value Corporation.

        <p>THE Ford Motor Company figures it has too much cash on its hands and thinks its shares are undervalued. So it plans to distribute $10 billion to its owners.</p>
        <p>So far so good. If Ford were a normal company, it would simply declare a special dividend or buy back a lot of shares. Instead, it is undertaking a bizarrely complicated transaction that calls for Ford to be acquired by another company, known as the Ford Value Corporation. Shareholders will get stock in the new company plus their choice of $20 a share in cash or additional shares. Those who take cash will get smaller dividend checks in the future.</p>
        <p>Why the machinations? They will allow the company to evade clauses in its certificate of incorporation that would deprive the Ford family of its voting control if family members sell too many shares. Right now, they must own a bit over 5 percent of the company through Class B shares to keep the right to have 40 percent of the votes.</p>
        <p>That certificate bars a number of tactics that might be used to let the Fords keep their votes while reducing their economic stake in the company. One maneuver that is specifically prohibited is declaring a stock dividend in which all shareholders get Class A shares -- the kind you and I can buy -- in addition to their existing shares. Yet that is exactly what this recapitalization accomplishes.</p>
        <p>When the dust settles, the Ford family members will have received about 7 new shares of Class A stock and 10 new shares of Class B in exchange for each 10 old Class B shares. (The exact ratio will depend on the price of Ford stock in the days before the recapitalization is completed.) They will then be able to sell those Class A shares when they need cash, maintaining the 40 percent vote even if their economic stake in Ford falls to 3.6 percent.</p>
        <p>''They are changing the rules in the middle of the game,'' complains Ken Bertsch, the director of corporate governance at TIAA-CREF, a large money management firm. ''The reason they can do that is that they have so many votes to start with. They can do this over and over again if they want to. They could go down to a tenth of a percent if they want to. What is to stop them?''</p>
        <p>The answer is that nothing can. TIAA-CREF will announce today that it will vote its 8.4 million shares against the plan at the shareholder meeting on Aug. 2. But that is not likely to have much of an effect, because the Ford family will be able to cast its 40 percent of the votes in favor, making it virtually impossible for its side to lose.</p>
        <p>Henry Wallace, Ford's chief financial officer, seemed puzzled yesterday as to why anyone would object. ''This was meant as a good strategy for all our shareholders to put cash out there in a tax-efficient way,'' he said in an interview. The certificate of incorporation's bar on stock dividends is irrelevant, he said. ''This is a recapitalization. It fully meets and complies with the letter of the law.''</p>
        <p>No doubt it does. In all probability the public shareholders understand why the Ford family will eventually need cash to pay estate taxes and would approve letting the family sell some shares without losing votes. But Ford is not offering them the chance to make that decision.</p>
        <p>It is not too late for Ford to change course. It could propose an amendment to its certificate of incorporation. Alternatively, William Clay Ford Jr., Ford's chairman, could announce that the family's shares will be voted in the same proportion as those of public holders at the Aug. 2 meeting. Either way, Ford would do the right thing by not evading the rules that public shareholders relied upon.</p>
