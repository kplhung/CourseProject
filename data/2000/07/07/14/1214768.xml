        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>G.O.P. TO HONOR HOFFA -- Republicans plan to hold a reception honoring the Teamsters' president, James P. Hoffa, on July 31, the first night of their party's convention in Philadelphia. The announcement yesterday by Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, underlined the Republicans' desire to win the Teamsters' support, or at least persuade the 1.4-million-member union not to endorse Vice President Al Gore, who has worked hard behind the scenes to win the union's backing. Thus far, Mr. Hoffa has bucked the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and not endorsed Mr. Gore because the vice president supported the China trade bill.</p>

        <p>NBC TO RELY ON CABLE -- Reflecting the migration of political news to cable, NBC News announced yesterday that its coverage of the party conventions on one of its cable outlets, MSNBC, would form ''the centerpiece of the NBC News effort.'' NBC will carry prime time reports from the Republican and Democratic conventions for a total of only two and a half hours on the final two nights of the four-day events, to be held in Philadelphia and Los Angeles. That is less than the commitment of four hours over three nights that ABC News has announced. But NBC News officials said the division's anchors and correspondents will appear throughout the continuing coverage of all four days of the gatherings on MSNBC.</p>

        <p>UNION CONTRACT SETTLED -- The last union without a contract for work at next month's Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles has resolved a labor dispute, allaying fears that labor troubles might disrupt the gathering. Local 501 of the International Union of Operating Engineers accepted a contract offer on Tuesday to take care of the heating, cooling and electrical systems in the downtown hall. Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, site of this summer's Republican National Convention, Local 58 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers is questioning why some television networks are not using union laborers for telecommunications work in that city's convention hall. Mayor John F. Street is trying to resolve the problem.</p>

        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>BUCHANAN CONSIDERS A LAWSUIT -- In the Reform Party's latest show of disarray, Patrick J. Buchanan, who is seeking its presidential nomination, has threatened to sue the party if the names of 400,000 people who requested party primary ballots through his campaign are made available to his rival, John Hagelin. By a 7-2 vote on Wednesday night, the party's executive committee voted to uphold rules that provide all candidates with equal access to potential primary voters. The actual names are not given to any campaign. But Mr. Buchanan has refused, and a spokesman said his campaign would not discuss the matter. Not so for Mr. Hagelin, who called Mr. Buchanan's position ''the latest assault on the democratic process of the Reform Party.'' The Hagelin campaign has agreed to make its list of 24,000 names available to Mr. Buchanan for the distribution of campaign material.</p>

        <p>THE MONEY</p>
        <p>HOUSE RACES BREAKING RECORDS -- In a year in which a switch of only six seats would give Democrats control of the House of Representatives, nominees and political committees in both parties are breaking fund-raising records. Sixteen Republican incumbents considered vulnerable already have raised at least a million dollars for their re-election campaigns, as have many of their Democratic challengers, figures released yesterday by the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee showed. Between Jan. 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000, the Republican committee said it raised $90 million, compared to $60 million during the same 18-month period in 1997-98. The Democratic committee reported raising $60 million during the 18 months, compared to $42 million raised during the entire 1997-98 election cycle.</p>
