        <p>As far as Richard C. Visconti is concerned, this is one billboard that won't float.</p>
        <p>Mr. Visconti, the city's acting buildings commissioner, returned to his office in Lower Manhattan on Wednesday from a dispiriting stint at the scene of a town house explosion in Brooklyn.

        <p>As far as Richard C. Visconti is concerned, this is one billboard that won't float.</p>
        <p>Mr. Visconti, the city's acting buildings commissioner, returned to his office in Lower Manhattan on Wednesday from a dispiriting stint at the scene of a town house explosion in Brooklyn. His shoes were still caked in dust. And there it was, out his window: ''DIRTPILE.com,'' all 72 feet of it. Taxi yellow and tomato red. Bobbing up and down behind a tugboat on the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>''I was absolutely outraged,'' Mr. Visconti said in an interview yesterday. ''Instead of the normal river traffic and the serenity the river gives me from time to time in moments of crisis, here's this illegal sign floating by my office.''</p>
        <p>Unlike most New Yorkers who have had their fill of dot-com billboards that wheel, crawl, roll, fly and sprawl, the commissioner was in a position to request assistance from the Police Department Harbor Unit.</p>
        <p>Within 30 minutes, Thomas Ward, a building inspector, had been ferried by the police out to the tugboat Gunny -- which by then had reached latitude 125th Street -- where he cited Dirtpile.com, a Web site dealing in heavy construction equipment, for violating Section 42-351 of the Zoning Resolution.</p>
        <p>''No moving or stationary advertising sign shall be displayed on a vessel plying waterways adjacent to manufacturing districts and within view from an arterial highway,'' the zoning rule states. The Joe DiMaggio Highway counts as the arterial road, and the buildings agency's headquarters, 60 Hudson Street, between Thomas and Worth Streets, are in a district zoned for manufacturing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Visconti said the matter would go to criminal court, where Dirtpile.com might be fined up to $5,000, but more likely $1,000.</p>
        <p>By yesterday evening, news of the violation had reached a penitent-sounding Larry Corbeil, the chief operating officer of Dirtpile.com, in Boston. ''It's something that wasn't done intentionally, trust me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Gunny and barge were launched on their promotional journey on June 9, Mr. Corbeil said, and had plied the coast of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut before heading to New York City, which was to be the culmination of the trip. ''Where are there more eyes than in New York?''</p>
        <p>''We've been on the high seas 30 days plus,'' he said, ''and this is the first notice we've received that we're in some sort of violation.''</p>
        <p>That is not to say that crowds on shore have been according it a happy OpSail salute. Tom Fagnant, a resident of Warwick, R.I., was quoted in The Providence Journal of June 25 as saying, ''It's pretty awful ugly.''</p>
        <p>As for where the Gunny will go next, Mr. Corbeil said: ''Our options are nothing but to be in compliance and not go where we're not supposed to go. What we're trying to do is promote our Web site for contractors. We're not trying to promote ill feelings with the law.''</p>
        <p>Paul Wein, a spokesman for the Buildings Department, who was part of the boarding party on Wednesday, said the captain of the Gunny, Michael Bornyak, was ''very cooperative.'' He asked where he could sail to be in compliance.</p>
        <p>''We said, 'The best place you can go is up to the Tappan Zee Bridge,' '' Mr. Wein said, ''which is out of our jurisdiction.''</p>
        <p>So, too, are motor vehicles, Mr. Visconti said, which means that the Buildings Department will not soon be boarding trailer-truck billboards.</p>
        <p>Clearly in a John Paul Jones kind of mood yesterday, Mr. Visconti said the Dirtpile incident demonstrated that his agency ''needs better enforcement tools to deal with the proliferation of advertising signs, which now extends to the waterways.''</p>
        <p>''We will enforce the zoning regulations even though we don't have a boat,'' he declared. ''We'll get a boat.''</p>
