        <p>Before Pop Art, there was found Pop Art, created by mostly anonymous designers and sign painters to promote commodities and service. The resemblance between the two has been noted many times, but it can still be startling, even when the evidence looks oddly stranded, as it does here.</p>
        <p>This show begins with a weatherbeaten wood cutout of a large milk bottle that has the stiff, awkward purity of folk art. Less pure and decidedly more Pop Artish are several enlarged objects called trade stimulators: a spool of cable-thick thread with a needle stuck through it, a never-lift Hoover steam iron and a Dunlop tire. More Surreal than real is a fat little tombstone with a black shroud and the triumphant words ''Duocide Did It.'' (The combination looks just enough like hair framing a blank face to suggest that what duocide did was erase features.)</p>

        <p>This show begins with a weatherbeaten wood cutout of a large milk bottle that has the stiff, awkward purity of folk art. Less pure and decidedly more Pop Artish are several enlarged objects called trade stimulators: a spool of cable-thick thread with a needle stuck through it, a never-lift Hoover steam iron and a Dunlop tire. More Surreal than real is a fat little tombstone with a black shroud and the triumphant words ''Duocide Did It.'' (The combination looks just enough like hair framing a blank face to suggest that what duocide did was erase features.)</p>
        <p>There are presentiments galore. The variously distressed surfaces of nine 22-inch-tall painted cast-iron Coca-Cola bottles anticipate the random variations of Andy Warhol's serial images of the same bottles.</p>
        <p>A ham sandwich and a hot dog rendered in enamel on tin bring to mind Claes Oldenburg and Roy Lichtenstein, while James Rosenquist is evoked by a painting of a glazed ham, signed by someone named Ben Brown, that suggests that each slice is stamped with the words ''Government Inspected.'' And predicting the non sequiturs of Fluxus and the white-black austerity of On Kawara's painted statements is a sign that announces ''Ice Never Fails.''</p>
        <p>More tangible than the objects' resemblance to Pop Art, however, is their distance from it. Putting aside the absence of artistic intention, most of these things are not interesting to view as art, not even the beautifully layered and scumbled surface of the Krug Fine Sausage sign. They signify an environment of quasi art that made Pop Art an inevitability. The first to notice this possibility were photographers like Walker Evans, William Klein, William Christenberry and Charles Harbutt, who photographed the smoke-ring-blowing Camel billboard in Times Square in 1960. Their images add a layer of necessary self-consciousness to this exhibition. In them you see America looking at its most common, ubiquitous self and liking what it sees.</p>
