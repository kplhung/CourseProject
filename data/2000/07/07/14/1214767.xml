        <p>Subway service in parts of New York City stopped briefly yesterday and then was delayed for about two hours after a disruption in a Con Edison line in Yonkers at noon caused a dip in electric power throughout the city and Westchester County.</p>
        <p>The incident, coming two weeks after a small-scale power disruption on the Upper East Side, led to more criticism of the utility by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>''It continues to distress me that Con Edison is not able to continuously offer us the kind of assurance that we are going to have the power that we need,'' Mr. Giuliani said, adding that he noticed the lights dim two or three times yesterday about noon as he was eating lunch at City Hall.</p>
        <p>Con Ed officials said late yesterday that as far as they knew, none of their three million customers in New York City and Westchester County had lost power. Voltage dipped about noon, after a tree branch apparently went too close to a 345,000-volt transmission line in the Dunwoodie section of Yonkers, causing the line to send the electricity into the tree, said Michael Clendenin, a Con Ed spokesman.</p>
        <p>Electricity was quickly rerouted through other lines in the system. But the resulting brief voltage dip caused a number of subway signals on the Upper West Side to malfunction, said Melissa Farley, a New York City Transit spokeswoman. Subway service on the 1, 2 and 3 lines in Upper Manhattan and the 2 and 5 lines in parts of the Bronx stopped for about two minutes. Delays then continued for about two hours as crews worked to ensure that all of the signals were working properly, she said.</p>
        <p>''The power disruption was very brief, but it was enough to impact the signal system in that part of the subway,'' said Bob Slovak, a transit spokesman.</p>
        <p>New York University Medical Center used its backup generator after the dip in power, Mr. Clendenin said, adding that no other significant impact had been reported in the region.</p>
        <p>Con Ed notified the city of the trouble, addressing previous criticism by Mr. Giuliani that the utility had been slow to inform officials of power problems. But the mayor said yesterday that he did not understand ''why lights have to blink off and on in New York City,'' because of a power problem in Westchester.</p>
