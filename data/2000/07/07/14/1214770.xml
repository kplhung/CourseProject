        <p>In the age of e-commerce and ubiquitous credit, many New Yorkers have found that they can carry on their daily activities without forking over a single greenback. Soon, cash transactions could become optional at one of their few remaining strongholds: yellow cabs.</p>
        <p>Officials of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission said yesterday that 50 yellow cabs had been cruising the city for the last three weeks with devices that allow riders to pay their fares with credit cards.</p>
        <p>A pilot program is likely to introduce hundreds more credit-card-friendly cabs to the streets in the next six months, they said.</p>
        <p>''It is something we've been thinking about for a while,'' the Taxi and Limousine commissioner, Diane McGrath-McKechnie, said at a news conference. ''The technology is available, and we're able to do it now.''</p>
        <p>The technology, developed by a Long Island City company, Taxitronic, links a credit-card reader to a modified taximeter. Riders can slide their Visa, MasterCard or American Express cards through a reader near the back seat.</p>
        <p>The card reader is also connected to a modem that operates on a cell phone frequency. The apparatus can get an approval of the passenger's card during the trip.</p>
        <p>At the end of the ride, the meter prints a receipt with the fare amount and blank lines for tolls and tip. Riders fill those out and hand the receipt to the driver, who enters the total into the meter.</p>
        <p>Drivers who work for fleets can get cash for their credit-card fares whenever they return to their garages. Nevertheless, some cabbies seemed hesitant about the new system. One, Zahoor Ahmed, said he went into his Brooklyn garage only once a week, and he could not wait that long to be paid.</p>
        <p>The New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents more than 2,000 drivers, is also opposed to the credit system. It fears that the cost of the technology will be passed along to the drivers through higher cab-leasing fees.</p>
        <p>''There's no benefit in this for the drivers, said Bhairavi Desai, a leader of the drivers' group.</p>
        <p>But supporters of the technology say fleet drivers do not incur any costs by accepting credit cards. Instead, taxi owners and owner-drivers who choose to adopt the system have to pay $550 to $950 per cab for installation. The cab owner also pays a monthly fee for the modem's cellular connection and a fee for each transaction -- 25 cents plus 1.53 percent of the amount charged on Visa and MasterCard. A spokesman for American Express would not disclose that company's fee.</p>
        <p>''It's a win-win all around,'' said Bruce Schaller, an independent taxi industry consultant based in Brooklyn. ''It's good for the customer, it's good for the industry.''</p>
        <p>Half of the 50 yellow cabs in New York that now take credit cards are owned by Ronart Leasing Corporation in Long Island City.</p>
        <p>Mike Levine, vice president of Ronart, said he believed that many people going to and from airports were using radio-dispatched limousines instead of yellow cabs because they want to pay with credit cards.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levine, whose fleet has 246 cabs, said reaction to the technology was mixed among fleet owners. Smaller fleets probably cannot afford the devices, he said.</p>
        <p>Several cities, including San Diego and Los Angeles, have used similar credit card systems in many cabs for years, Mr. Schaller said.</p>
