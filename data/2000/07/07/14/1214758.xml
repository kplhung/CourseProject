        <p>Deciding whether Rep Rick A Lazio is a conservative or not can be tricky because ideology can cut both ways in his bid for Senate in New York; Democrats hold a 3-to-2 advantage in voter registration, and moderate Republicans have been most successful, but it is also important for Lazio to court Conservative Party; Lazio tends to talk up conservative issues when campaigning upstate (M)</p>

        <p>He has named his campaign bus the ''Mainstream Express,'' but called himself a conservative in a recent fund-raising letter.

        <p>Making matters more complicated, the American Conservative Union last year gave him a rating of 65 percent, compared with 80 for the House as a whole, on votes on issues important to conservatives. But he hired as campaign manager Bill Dal Col, a conservative who managed Mr. Forbes's two presidential campaigns, and appointed as deputy campaign manager Eileen Long, the 28-year-old daughter of the state Conservative Party chairman.</p>
        <p>So is Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate, conservative or not?</p>
        <p>''The problem is we are not going to play label games,'' said Mike Murphy, Mr. Lazio's chief strategist. ''He is not a textbook conservative but clearly he is conservative on some issues and not others. He is for the balanced budget and other conservative issues, but he also is pro-assault weapons ban.''</p>
        <p>The conservative side gets some attention today as he makes his first joint appearance with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. They will appear together at a fund-raising luncheon in Manhattan for the state Conservative Party.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush describes himself as a ''compassionate conservative,'' Mr. Lazio, running in a state where Democrats hold a 3-to-2 advantage in voter registration and moderate Republicans have been most successful, hardly ever uses the word ''conservative'' on the stump. He has disputed claims by the campaign office of his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, that he is far to the right of most New York Republicans.</p>
        <p>Whatever the complexity of his ideology, it pays for Mr. Lazio to court the Conservative Party.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1962 by Republicans frustrated by the perceived liberal leanings of the state party, its influence has steadily grown. No Republican candidate running for statewide office has won without the party's support since 1974. Despite a registration of 171,496 -- a hair behind the the third-largest party, the Independence Party, at 172,471 -- more than 300,000 people voted on the Conservative line on the ballot for Gov. George E. Pataki in his 1994 and 1998 elections -- support that, if repeated, could tilt a close election in Mr. Lazio's favor.</p>
        <p>The party chairman, Michael R. Long, makes those points almost gleefully.</p>
        <p>''He can't take conservatives for granted,'' Mr. Long said of Mr. Lazio in an interview this week. ''I would clearly agree with you that conservatives in general would vote for Rick Lazio before they would vote for Hillary Clinton, but that does not give a candidate, any candidate, a license to go so far in a different direction. What happens is you take the steam out of, the enthusiasm out of, your core voters.''</p>
        <p>They may seem odd partners. Mr. Long, 60, a gruff ex-marine and liquor store owner who runs the Conservative Party from a spartan office above a travel agency in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Mr. Lazio, 42, a fresh-faced former lawyer from the outer suburbs of Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>But after a three-hour meeting at a burger restaurant in Bay Ridge in December 1998 and subsequent talks, usually every other week, they developed a rapport.</p>
        <p>Mr. Long said that he believed Mr. Lazio's alliance with the party was genuine and that he connected with Mr. Lazio's willingness to keep an open mind on issues. Mr. Lazio, who says he supports abortion rights, backs a ban on a late-term procedure -- a key tenet of the Conservative platform -- and opposes public financing for abortions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Long said Mr. Lazio, in conversations, had ''indicated he would look at, if new information came forward, whether or not to allow abortion after the first trimester.'' Mr. Lazio, he said, also is willing to support the idea of requiring parental notification for minors seeking abortions. [Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, said the congressman supported Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision permitting abortion, and had no intention of changing his stance. Mr. McLagan said Mr. Lazio had voted to bar someone other than a parent from taking a child across state lines for an abortion without parental notification, but he did not know if Mr. Lazio's position extended beyond that.]</p>
        <p>Altogether, Mr. Long said he had the impression that Mr. Lazio was ''not locked in cement'' and that he had an open mind on abortion and other issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio tends to talk up conservative issues when campaigning upstate. At a string of Republican Party rallies during a bus tour last week, he never failed to work in promises to ''cut your taxes'' and fight for a balanced budget.</p>
        <p>''We're going to talk about budget discipline because it's immoral to spend money that other people have earned,'' he told supporters in Massena. ''It's immoral to ask somebody making $20,000 to pay higher taxes.''</p>
        <p>The luncheon, with tickets going for $500 apiece, is expected to net at least $100,000, which would go toward the $750,000 the party is seeking to raise for the November elections. Mr. Long said the money would be spent on direct mail and television advertising advocating Conservative Party positions and, closer to November, urging people to vote the Conservative Party line, which will include Mr. Lazio and Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The Conservative Party produced the first ad mentioning Mr. Lazio's name after he jumped into the race May 20 upon the departure of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. That advertisement, financed with largely unregulated contributions known as ''soft money'' that by law is to be used to build up a party or to address an issue, promoted Mr. Lazio's background but did not directly mention his candidacy.</p>
        <p>It is now the focus of a complaint filed yesterday with the Federal Election Commission by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law. ''It is impossible to find the issue advocated in the ad, other than Congressman Lazio's fondness for Long Island's beaches and his status as a lifetime New Yorker,'' said a statement from the Brennan Center, which filed the complaint on behalf of the Green Party. Mr. Long said he stood by the ad.</p>
