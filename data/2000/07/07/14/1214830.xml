        <p>Scientists are complaining about the consultations that President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa has held with ''dissidents'' who do not believe that H.I.V. causes AIDS (news article, July 10). They should know, however, what epidemiologists have said for years: that although H.I.V. is the biological cause of AIDS, poverty is one of the disease's top two risk factors.</p>
        <p>What many scientists at the AIDS conference in South Africa have failed to understand is that poverty, access to facilities, education and fundamental inequalities are proven determinants of the spread of the disease. Unless these inequalities are addressed, the disease will not be cured.</p>
