        <p>On a campaign swing yesterday through Queens, Hillary Rodham Clinton offered her most detailed explanation yet about why she kissed Suha Arafat, the wife of Yasir Arafat, after Mrs. Arafat made scathing remarks about Israel during a joint appearance in November.</p>
        <p>''Some of you may or may have not been to the Middle East,'' Mrs. Clinton said, ''but a kiss is a handshake.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, appearing at the Bell Park Jewish Center in Queens Village, made the remarks in response to a woman's question on the encounter with Mrs. Arafat, and on her stand on the issue of Palestinian statehood.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton did not offer her opinion on whether there should be a Palestinian state, but said that her political opponents would ''keep raising and keep raising'' the encounter with Mrs. Arafat.</p>
        <p>The incident, which provoked harsh criticism at the time from Jewish organizations in the United States, involved a joint appearance by the two women on the West Bank.</p>
        <p>''I was in a very difficult position, and I am the first to admit that,'' Mrs. Clinton said to a largely supportive group of more than 300 people at the Queens Village center.</p>
        <p>''I did what I was expected to do,'' she said, adding that she had ''responded appropriately as the first lady of the United States.''</p>
        <p>During the November joint appearance in Ramallah, Mrs. Arafat, speaking in Arabic, accused the Israeli government of poisoning Palestinian women and children with toxic gas.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton showed clear signs of discomfort during the remarks but gave Mrs. Arafat a polite, salutatory kiss when she left.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mrs. Clinton offered an explanation that was similar to one she gave reporters in November, but it was her first expansive discussion on the episode before a large group of voters. She said the translation of Mrs. Arafat's remarks that she was given in earphones during the West Bank event was different, and far less offensive, than the more accurate version she learned of after leaving Israel for Jordan.</p>
        <p>''There was great debate over what was the right translation, the one I heard in my ears or the one that was put out after I left Israel,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, she said, ''immediately when I found out about the alternative translation I condemned it,'' adding that Mrs. Arafat's remarks had been ''inflammatory and outrageous.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, who was asked by another member of the audience in Queens Village if she had changed her ''pro-Arab'' views, responded by saying that she and President Clinton had been supporters of Israel throughout their political careers and that ''all my comments and work I have done had been premised on what would be in the best interest of Israel.''</p>
