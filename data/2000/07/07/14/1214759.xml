        <p>In exchange for a cash payment, the estate of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. has dropped its lawsuit against CBS News over the rights to Dr. King's 1963 masterwork, the ''I Have a Dream'' speech.</p>
        <p>Neither side would disclose the amount of the payment, which is considered to be a tax-deductible contribution to the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, in Atlanta. As part of the settlement reached on Wednesday, CBS will retain the right to use its film of the speech and to license it to others, although the network agreed to provide information on how outside parties could contact the estate ''regarding the estate's claimed intellectual property rights,'' according to a news release issued by both sides.</p>
        <p>CBS also agreed to provide film of Dr. King's speeches for the King estate's own productions.</p>
        <p>Dr. King's heirs sued the network in 1996 after CBS began selling a videotape that included excerpts of the civil rights leader's best-known words, delivered on Aug. 28, 1963, at a civil rights rally at the Lincoln Memorial. The excerpts were part of a five-volume documentary, ''The 20th Century With Mike Wallace,'' that was selling for $99.95.</p>
        <p>The family, which has long been criticized by scholars for its aggressive profit-making approach to Dr. King's legacy, argued that outside corporations should not be allowed to exploit Dr. King's memory without giving a share to the estate. ''It has to do with the principle that if you make a dollar, I should make a dime,'' said Dexter Scott King, Dr. King's son and president of the estate, in 1997.</p>
        <p>In July 1998, a federal judge in Atlanta ruled against the family, declaring that the speech was a news event in the public domain. The judge, William C. O'Kelley, noted that the speech had been shown live and that the text had earlier been given to news organizations.</p>
        <p>Last November, however, a federal appeals panel in Atlanta overturned that decision and sent the case back to the lower court.</p>
        <p>The settlement means there will not be a formal legal resolution of these issues. Both CBS and the King family were circumspect about the settlement, refusing to discuss any aspect of it beyond the news release, which said that both sides were pleased with the resolution.</p>
        <p>But Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment lawyer who represented CBS in the case, said the settlement preserved the network's original contentions about the public nature of the speech.</p>
        <p>''From CBS's perspective, this has always been about the principle that they have right to use footage they take of news events,'' Mr. Abrams said. ''From their vantage point, that principle remains inviolate, and is consistent with this resolution.''</p>
        <p>He said the settlement grew out of a meeting earlier this year between Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, and Dexter King and his mother, Coretta Scott King.</p>
