        <p>Here is a selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>BARBARA CARROLL, Bemelmans Bar, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. This agelessly chic red-haired pianist and singer seems to know every important popular song ever written and to be able to perform from memory in any key. Her elegant, lyrical pianism is a compendium of 20th-century jazz styles, from Count Basie to Erroll Garner to Bill Evans and beyond. And her clipped, understated vocals, which verge on speech-song, approach lyrics from a wry but warmhearted point of view. Through July 22. Tuesday through Saturday nights, beginning at 9:30. From 5:30 to 8, Michael Devine. No cover for early show; cover for late show: $15. No minimum; $5 cover at the bar.</p>

        <p>BARBARA CARROLL, Bemelmans Bar, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. This agelessly chic red-haired pianist and singer seems to know every important popular song ever written and to be able to perform from memory in any key.

From 5:30 to 8, Michael Devine. No cover for early show; cover for late show: $15. No minimum; $5 cover at the bar.</p>
        <p>* HOWARD FISHMAN QUARTET, Sardi's, 234 West 44th Street, (212) 221-8440. Powerful echoes of Stephane Grappelli and Bix Beiderbecke are among the influences rippling through the Howard Fishman Quartet's seamless swing. The group -- Mr. Fishman on guitar, banjo and vocals; Russell Farhang playing virtuosic Grappelli-style violin; Peter Ecklund on cornet; Andrew Hall on bass -- folds elements of vintage jazz, swing and early bluegrass into rhythmically animated, richly allusive jazz chamber music. Whether the music is Stephen Foster (a bubbly ''Old Folks at Home''), Gershwin (''Soon'') or Romberg (''When I Grow Too Old to Dream''), it is all translated into lilting, fine-tuned ensemble music that transcends time and idiom. Fridays at 10:30 p.m. No cover charge, but $15 minimum at tables.</p>
        <p>* KT SULLIVAN, Firebird Cafe, 363 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 586-0244. The singer's latest whimsically quirky exploration of a particular composer's work casts an astute sideways gaze at Richard Rodgers, concentrating on his work with Lorenz Hart rather than Oscar Hammerstein. High points include a bizarre earlier version of the song we all know as ''Blue Moon'' and ''10 Cents a Dance'' done as an intimate interior monologue full of subtle mood swings. Larry Woodard supplies brisk, incisive piano accompaniment and occasional vocal support. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; Thursday at 9. Through July 21. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Sunday night at 7, Lorraine Feather and Dick Hyman, part of the singer-songwriters series. Cover: $20; $15 minimum. Sunday night at 9, James Beaman, singer-impersonator. Cover: $30; $15 minimum.</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Blue Angel Theater, 323 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes, which focuses on what Mr. Comstock calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, a creamy baritone who echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock concentrates on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves that there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Billy Stritch fills in for Eric Comstock through July 26 except on Mondays. Tonight, Monday through Wednesday nights at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 7:30. Tickets: $50 and $55 (premium ringside seating, $75 and $80).</p>
        <p>* LILLIAS WHITE, Arci's Place, 450 Park Avenue South, at 30th Street, (212) 532-4370. If there's such a thing as a pop diva without airs, Lillias White, who last appeared on Broadway in ''The Life'' (and Off Broadway in ''Dinah Was''), is it. The singer, who grew up in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, melds classic jazz, funk, pop-soul and even calypso influences into a style that at moments suggest a theater-wise hybrid of Chaka Khan and Dinah Washington. Her program runs from a calypso singalong and showstoppers from ''Dream Girls'' (in which she also appeared) to Cher's hit ''Believe.'' Everything she does is infused with an unflagging emotional honesty that is upbeat without ever becoming saccharin. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11; Tuesday through Thursday nights at 9. Through July 22.</p>
        <p>CARNEGIE CLUB, 156 West 56th Street, (212) 957-9676. Cary Hoffman, with the 11-piece Carnegie Club Orchestra, plays music made famous by Frank Sinatra in the 1950's, featuring the original arrangements by Nelson Riddle. Saturdays at 9:30 and 11 p.m. Cover: $20; two-drink ($15) minimum.</p>
        <p>DANNY'S SKYLIGHT ROOM, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133. Tonight from 9 to 1 in the piano bar, Jerry Scott; at 9:15, Sandy Salko-Parra, singer, in ''So Many Lifetimes.'' Tomorrow night from 5 to 9 in the piano bar, Chuck Musone; from 9 to 1 in the piano bar, Mr. Scott; at 9:15, Margy Seides, singer. Sunday at 4 p.m., Mr. Blues, singer; from 7 to 11, Sol Yaged and friends. Monday night from 8 to midnight, Chris Barrett. Cover: free to $15; $10 minimum.</p>
        <p>FEINSTEIN'S, at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. Marc Salem, singer. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11; Tuesday through Thursday nights at 8:30. Cover: $40; dinner required for early show, with seating beginning at 6; a la carte supper menu with $20 minimum for late show; $35 for early show. Through Sept. 2.</p>
        <p>OAK ROOM, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 840-6800. Loston Harris Trio. Tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11:30; Tuesday through Thursday nights at 9. Cover: $40, with dinner required for early shows Fridays and Saturdays; $15 food or drink minimum for other shows; suggested dinner arrival for early show is 7. Through July 29.</p>
        <p>SUPPER CLUB, 240 West 47th Street, (212) 921-1940. Tonight and tomorrow night from 8 to midnight, the Supper Club's 17-piece big band. Also, the 25-minute swing revue ''This Joint Is Jumpin' '' at 9:30 and 10:30 p.m., with Larry Marshall. Swing dance lessons every Friday and Saturday night from 11:15 to midnight in the Blue Room. Tonight, Jumpin' Gigolos; tomorrow night, Yallopin' Hounds from 12:30 to 2:30 a.m. Cover: $25 before 11, $15 after.</p>
        <p>UPSTAIRS AT ROSE'S TURN, 55 Grove Street, West Village, (212) 366-5438. Tonight at 11, ''Candy Comedy Hour.'' Tomorrow night at 9 and 11, Russ Turk, singer; at 11, ''Candy Comedy Hour.'' Sunday night at 10, Adria Malcolm, singer. Cover: $5 to $7; two-drink minimum. No credit cards.</p>
