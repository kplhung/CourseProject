        <p>My family chose to home-school because the public high schools in this area are huge, crowded and chaotic. Our son has benefited from Apex Learning online Advanced Placement courses; he took one his sophomore year, four his junior year and plans to take three his senior year.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''As Teacher in the Classroom, Internet Needs Fine-Tuning'' (front page, July 7):</p>
        <p>My family chose to home-school because the public high schools in this area are huge, crowded and chaotic. Our son has benefited from Apex Learning online Advanced Placement courses; he took one his sophomore year, four his junior year and plans to take three his senior year.</p>
        <p>The course work is difficult, and the occasional computer glitches are annoying. But he has been taught by skilled and caring teachers, and the Apex staff has been most helpful to me (a liberal arts grad with no teacher training), as I serve as his mentor teacher.</p>
        <p>We realized the value of Internet courses when we had to make arrangements with four schools in two states so that he could take the  Advanced Placement tests. It would be impossible for a student in our geographic isolation to take this many Advanced Placement courses any other way.</p>
