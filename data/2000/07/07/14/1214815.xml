        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Housing Crisis Confounds a Prosperous City'' (news article, July 9):</p>
        <p>While it is true that New York's housing shortage could be ameliorated with increased public financing and a renewed political commitment, the present crisis is also partly a result of middle-  and upper-middle-class New Yorkers who deprive needy families of housing opportunities. One example is the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program.</p>
        <p>Since 1955, the program has constructed approximately 110,000 units of moderate-  and middle-income housing for New Yorkers. Originally, strict income guidelines were observed. Today, single elderly tenants occupy three-  and four-bedroom apartments. Rich families use the apartments as weekend pieds-a-terre and city vacation homes, refusing to move even when their income dictates it.</p>
        <p>And state and city housing officials and politicians ignore this problem, no doubt because many of them occupy such housing.</p>
