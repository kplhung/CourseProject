        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has ended its investigation of Tyco International's accounting practices without taking action against the company, Tyco said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The news helped send shares of Tyco up $3, to $51.50, nearly the level they were at in October of last year, before a prominent investment manager wrote a report in which he called the company's bookkeeping methods too aggressive. When the company disclosed the S.E.C. investigation in December, the stock fell to its lowest point, closing on Dec. 9 at $28.25, adjusted for a subsequent split.</p>
        <p>Joanne Cronrath Bamberger, a spokeswoman for the S.E.C., declined to comment yesterday. Tyco did not provide any details beyond its brief statement.</p>
        <p>The company, a conglomerate based in Bermuda, became one of the stars of the late 1990's bull market by buying up rivals it considered poorly managed and making them more efficient.</p>
        <p>The company, which had $22.5 billion in revenue last year, makes underwater telecommunications systems, security alarms and disposable medical products, among other things.</p>
        <p>But when David W. Tice, the investment manager and short-seller based in Dallas, said last year that Tyco had taken overly large charges and delayed some payments, masking weakness in both its earnings and cash flow, investors reacted sharply. The accounting moves came during Tyco's $30 billion acquisition binge that started in 1996.</p>
        <p>Last month, the company announced it would move some of its accounting charges to different quarters in response to regulators' concerns. The change gave confidence to some investors who had been nervous about buying the stock, analysts said.</p>
        <p>In a statement yesterday, Mr. Tice said he stood by his original report and called the company's recent change ''a substantial action which is rarely required by the S.E.C.''</p>
