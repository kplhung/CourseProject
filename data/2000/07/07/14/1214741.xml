        <p>It appears that not everything happens as scripted at Camp David.</p>
        <p>Unknown to their American hosts, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, held an impromptu meeting at Mr. Arafat's cabin on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>President Clinton was not present, nor was Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, nor any other American negotiator. The two leaders, who have met each other on a number of occasions back home, talked for about an hour before dinner, accompanied by some of their negotiators.</p>
        <p>The substance of what was said was not described in the brief account given by the State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, who was scrambling this morning to find out details of what went on.</p>
        <p>But the fact that such an encounter took place was taken as a sign that a serious effort was being made by the two sides to deal with the issues.</p>
        <p>The encounter was also in contrast to the first Middle East summit meeting at Camp David 22 years ago, when President Carter negotiated between the Egyptian president, Anwar el-Sadat, and the Israeli prime minister, Menachem Begin. Then, Mr. Begin and Mr. Sadat met in Mr. Carter's presence only, and after the third day refused to even do that until the final treaty was signed.</p>
        <p>This morning, Mr. Clinton was confident enough to leave Camp David for some previously scheduled events. He left the conference in the hands of Dr. Albright until his return tonight in time for dinner.</p>
        <p>At the annual conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Baltimore, Mr. Clinton asked for prayers for a ''full, final and fair peace.'' He cited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as saying peace was more than the absence of war but also the presence of justice and brotherhood.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, apparently trying to broaden his seven-member delegation, was joined in negotiations by Dan Meridor, the chairman of the foreign affairs and defense committee in the Israeli Parliament.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meridor, a former member of the Likud party, lent more conservative credentials to the Israeli team at a time when Mr. Barak faces opposition at home from conservative and religious political parties.</p>
        <p>Outside Camp David, three Palestinian leaders from the radical wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization said they wanted to meet with Mr. Arafat during the talks. Such an encounter would break the rules of seclusion set down by the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>Their request appeared to be an attempt to warn Mr. Arafat that his domestic constituency was not unified behind the goal of a peace agreement with Israel.</p>
        <p>The State Department did not rule out such a meeting, saying ''provisions can be made to bring a limited group of people for a brief time'' to the meeting. But so far, Mr. Boucher said, no request had been received from the three Palestinians, who represent the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Marxist Palestinian People's Party and the Popular Struggle Front.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton was away, Dr. Albright met for an hour with Mr. Barak this afternoon and then with the delegations of both sides. Mr. Boucher studiously avoided any reference to what they talked about, relying on the familiar vocabulary of the delegates ''grappling'' with the ''tough issues'' that need to be resolved for a peace agreement.</p>
        <p>The actual content of those issues -- the borders of a Palestinian state, the number of Israeli settlers on the West Bank to be annexed into Israel, the status of Palestinian refugees and the future status of Jerusalem -- have not been mentioned at any of the briefings in the last three days.</p>
