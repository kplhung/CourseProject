        <p>''Manhattan Contrasts,'' an exhibition of generally conservative, representational paintings of 20th-century New York at the New-York Historical Society, is modest to a fault. Images are mostly of buildings old and new viewed from near and far, interspersed here and there with a few genre scenes. Quality ranges from journeyman competence to high academic proficiency. Hardly any very well-known artists are included.</p>
        <p>But the event is interesting nevertheless because it gets one thinking about the relationship between modern art and modern experience. The 35 paintings are drawn from the Historical Society's own collections, and the occasion is meant in part to prompt meditation about its continuing art collecting program. What kind of art should the society acquire to preserve for future generations a sense of what the modern city has been like?</p>

        <p>''Manhattan Contrasts,'' an exhibition of generally conservative, representational paintings of 20th-century New York at the New-York Historical Society, is modest to a fault. Images are mostly of buildings old and new viewed from near and far, interspersed here and there with a few genre scenes. Quality ranges from journeyman competence to high academic proficiency. Hardly any very well-known artists are included.</p>
        <p>But the event is interesting nevertheless because it gets one thinking about the relationship between modern art and modern experience. The 35 paintings are drawn from the Historical Society's own collections, and the occasion is meant in part to prompt meditation about its continuing art collecting program. What kind of art should the society acquire to preserve for future generations a sense of what the modern city has been like?</p>
        <p>Consider a picture by Ernest Albert of snow falling on a muddy construction site in front of Grand Central Terminal. The painting represents the place where the Grand Union Hotel was demolished in 1914 and the Pershing Square Building would rise in 1923. It is a lovely piece of work: with a deft, painterly touch, Albert envelops the precisely rendered Beaux-Arts train station and surrounding modern buildings in a quiet, snowy haze, turning the scene into a pastoral reverie.</p>
        <p>It is an archetypal urban scene, its cheek-by-jowl juxtapositions of old and new, of creation and destruction, exactly what the exhibition title is meant to evoke.</p>
        <p>But how true is such a picture to the real experience of modern metropolitan life? There are moments, like early on a Sunday morning, when the city can be possessed of such beneficent stillness; but those are not the typical moments; this is, after all, the city that never sleeps, and Albert's peaceful painting leaves out so much: the noise, the clamor, the hectic pace, the feelings of alarm and exhilaration that accompany the city's surges of transformation and upheaval.</p>
        <p>The essence of modern life, as Robert Hughes explained in his essential modern-art textbook ''The Shock of the New,'' is process. More than fixed structures, it is flux that most deeply characterizes city life, and the forms of art that have flourished in modern times -- Cubism, Expressionism and Surrealism -- have come about because premodern forms, made for a world that changed imperceptibly slowly, could not adequately represent a world in which nothing is stable, where all that is solid melts into air. Think of 20th-century artists who best captured the spirit of the city: John Marin, Stuart Davis, Piet Mondrian with his ''Broadway Boogie Woogie,'' Robert Rauschenberg.</p>
        <p>They are artists who sacrificed documentary representation to match the dynamism of modernity with their own syncopating or clashing formal rhythms.</p>
        <p>Some works in ''Manhattan Contrasts'' try to convey the modernity of the city with a self-consciously modernizing style. Victor Perelli painted a picture of the Empire State Building under the influence of Art Deco, simplifying it into a gleaming, striped monolith that shoots up into the sky like a rocket ship from the blocky mud-colored buildings huddled around its base.</p>
        <p>A curious, and technically impressive, piece of illustration is a small gouache painting from 1950 by Chesley Bonestell that envisions an H-bomb exploding at the lower end of Manhattan. The city, with all its tiny buildings silhouetted against the nuclear glare, is rendered in miniaturistic detail. What is exceptional about this image in the context of the show is that it depicts not just visible facts but an event -- an imaginary event at that.</p>
        <p>Yet by making visible a possibility that was widely feared at the time, the early years of the cold war, Bonestell's image speaks volumes about mid-20th century social experience. History, after all, is as much in the stories, fantasies and anxieties that a culture shares as it is its concrete material fabric.</p>
        <p>For the most part, however, the Historical Society's collecting has focused on painting as representational documentation -- a function that photography can perform as well, if not better. Two paintings from about 1900 by Stafford Mantle Northcote take the viewer into a Chinese theater with a show in progress, and a quiet Chinese laundry; they are intriguing mainly for anthropological reasons and would likely be even more so as photographs.</p>
        <p>There are paintings from the 1990's that could have been painted before World War I. Some are very fine, like a large twilight view by Douglas Safranek from his high studio window in Brooklyn over the brick industrial buildings of Williamsburg to the distant skyline of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Certainly realist images of the city will continue to be needed; this collection could never be complete without a painting by Rackstraw Downs. But the collection's most recent acquisition, a neo-Pop diptych of pagoda-styled commercial buildings in Chinatown by the Chinese-American painter Martin Wong, shows the society expanding its parameters -- a good thing if it wants to stay in touch with the pulse of the city. With a broadened outlook driving the collecting of art, it is exciting to imagine what a show of this kind might look like in the year 2100.</p>
        <p>''Manhattan Contrasts: 20th-Century Paintings of New York From the Collection of the New-York Historical Society'' will remain on view at the New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 873-3400, through Aug. 27.</p>
