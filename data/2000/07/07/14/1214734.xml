        <p>President Clinton strongly criticized Republicans today for blocking his African-American and Hispanic judicial nominees, and he urged delegates to the annual convention of the N.A.A.C.P. to elect Vice President Al Gore to ensure that the courts remained diverse.</p>
        <p>''One of the most important responsibilities of the next president is appointing judges,'' said Mr. Clinton, who predicted that over the next four years there would be two to four Supreme Court vacancies, more than a score of Court of Appeals vacancies and more than 100 openings on federal district courts.</p>

        <p>President Clinton strongly criticized Republicans today for blocking his African-American and Hispanic judicial nominees, and he urged delegates to the annual convention of the N.A.A.C.P. to elect Vice President Al Gore to ensure that the courts remained diverse.</p>
        <p>''One of the most important responsibilities of the next president is appointing judges,'' said Mr. Clinton, who predicted that over the next four years there would be two to four Supreme Court vacancies, more than a score of Court of Appeals vacancies and more than 100 openings on federal district courts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton called it ''outrageous'' that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which has the highest percentage of African-American residents of any judicial area, is without a single black judge. He singled out for criticism Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, whom the president blamed for blocking his nominees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also said the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, had remained silent when Republicans in that state blocked a Hispanic nominee, Enrique Moreno, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</p>
        <p>''The quality of justice suffers when highly qualified women and minority candidates, fully vetted, fully supported by the American Bar Association, are denied the opportunity to serve for partisan political reasons,'' the president said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton took a break from the Middle East peace talks today to make his final address as president to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which helped turn out black voters for Mr. Clinton in 1992 and 1996.</p>
        <p>''I had to come to Baltimore today,'' Mr. Clinton said, likening ''the spirit of freedom and reconciliation'' of the N.A.A.C.P. with what he is seeking in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>When he took the podium, Mr. Clinton quickly transformed from peacemaker to politician.</p>
        <p>He praised Mr. Bush for not avoiding the N.A.A.C.P convention, as the Republican presidential nominee in 1996, Bob Dole, had done. But Mr. Clinton said he thought Mr. Gore had delivered the better speech of the two presidential contenders and would make the better president.</p>
        <p>Members of the audience clapped politely when Mr. Bush spoke on Monday. They jumped to their feet after Mr. Gore's address on Wednesday. But they saved a hero's welcome for Mr. Clinton today.</p>
        <p>''We've had a lot of vice presidents, a lot of vice presidents made great presidents -- Thomas Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''But we've never had a vice president that did so much good as vice president as Al Gore -- never, not ever in the history of the country.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Gore had done in his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Clinton quoted from the Bible in his remarks. Citing Ecclesiastes 11:25 -- ''In the day of prosperity, there is forgetfulness of affliction'' -- the president said this period of economic growth is the ideal time to focus on the less fortunate.</p>
        <p>He reminded the audience of his first visit to an N.A.A.C.P. convention, in 1992, when he was governor of Arkansas and Mr. Gore was a senator from Tennessee.</p>
        <p>''I pledged then -- and I want to quote it exactly, I don't want to miss a word -- I pledged you 'an administration that looks like America; one that knows the promise and the pain of this country; one that will rebuild, reunite and renew the American spirit,' '' Mr. Clinton said. ''I think together we have honored that pledge.''</p>
        <p>The N.A.A.C.P. is a nonpartisan organization, but the political preferences of those in the audience were clear. They jumped to their feet, applauded loudly and cried out as the president spoke.</p>
        <p>''We don't endorse politicians,'' said Julian Bond, the chairman of the N.A.A.C.P. ''But we know how to recognize our friends, and this president is our friend.''</p>
