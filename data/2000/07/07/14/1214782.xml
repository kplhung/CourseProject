        <p>The Senate voted overwhelmingly today against suspending the federal gasoline tax through the November election, calling the measure a calibrated attempt to cozy up to voters at the expense of the nation's roads and highways.</p>
        <p>The amendment required that 60 senators vote to bypass the law governing the nation's budget. But it was defeated when only 40 senators agreed to waive the law. An additional 59 voted against waiving the budget law, including 15 Republicans.</p>
        <p>Despite cries from voters for relief from record-high gasoline prices, both Republicans and Democrats criticized the measure today, saying it would have conveniently suspended 18.3 cents a gallon of the federal gasoline tax for 150 days, or until  after the November elections, and then reinstituted it.</p>
        <p>What's more, the measure, attached to a bill that would reduce inheritance taxes, could imperil favorite road, highway, bridge and safety projects, opponents asserted.</p>
        <p>''This is really in some sense a disingenuous amendment,'' said Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat.</p>
        <p>''It would make Tammany Hall blush. It purports to lower taxes before an election and then increase taxes right after the election. I tell you. Is that what the American public wants us to do?''</p>
        <p>The amendment was put forward by Senator Spencer Abraham, a Michigan Republican who is in a close re-election race, and several other senators from the Midwest, the region that has been hardest hit by increasing gasoline prices. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican from oil-rich Texas, also co-sponsored the measure.</p>
        <p>For weeks motorists have expressed outrage over high prices at the pump, turning the increases into a touchy political issue. Lawmakers have scrambled to appease motorists and assign blame, and some states have gone so far as to suspend their own gas taxes temporarily.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, tried to capitalize on the issue by painting his likely opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, as a lackey for the oil industry, which has profited from high gasoline prices. Mr. Bush, in turn, has accused Mr. Gore and the Clinton administration of failing to devise a coherent domestic energy policy and relying too much on foreign oil. Last month, Mr. Gore laid out a plan to reduce dependence on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>The Federal Trade Commission has begun an investigation, at President Clinton's behest, to determine why gasoline prices climbed so high and whether oil companies were engaged in price-fixing.</p>
        <p>Analysts say gasoline prices have spiked for a number of reasons: past decreases in oil production from oil-producing countries, pipeline disruptions, shortages at refineries and new rules on clean-burning fuel.</p>
        <p>After peaking several weeks ago, the price of gas is now falling. Regular gasoline averages $1.59 a gallon both nationally and in the Midwest, down from average highs of $1.68 nationally and $1.87 in the Midwest. When prices rose to that $1.68 figure, they were nearly 44 percent higher than last summer's average.</p>
        <p>Oil-producing countries remain reluctant to support the Saudi Arabian proposal that would increase output and send oil prices back to $25 a barrel from the current level of around $30.</p>
        <p>OPEC nations did raise output quotas on July 1, but the additional production goals proposed by Saudi Arabia were criticized by other OPEC members, which describe current prices as reasonable and supply as sufficient.</p>
        <p>John Cook, the federal Energy Information Administration's petroleum division director told the Senate Energy Committee that despite some moderation of prices in the Midwest, other areas might see price surges. ''We may experience more volatility before the summer is over,'' Mr. Cook said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abraham said prices were still much higher than they were last year. Mothers with mini-vans, farmers and truckers, some of whom have lost jobs because they could not afford the gasoline, deserve immediate relief, he said.</p>
        <p>''It's the one thing we can do in the Congress to bring down the price of gas and bring it down immediately,'' Mr. Abraham said.</p>
        <p>Most opponents of the amendment said a suspension of the federal gasoline tax would mean an estimated $12 billion loss for the Highway Trust Fund, which provides vital financing to build highways, repair roads and maintain safety.</p>
        <p>Many state and local leaders also opposed the measure, fearing an interruption in their own transportation planning. Some also make an economic argument against cutting the price of gasoline, saying it would only encourage consumers to buy more.</p>
        <p>Senator Abraham and others sought to allay those concerns, saying the $12 billion would be replenished by money from the budget surplus that is not reserved for Social Security.</p>
        <p>''If the highway trust fund were going to be affected at all, I would not be a sponsor of this amendment,'' Senator Hutchison said.</p>
        <p>Most senators disagreed with her assessment. ''It would, over the long run, put at risk billions of dollars of necessary investment in our nation's highway infrastructure, while providing absolutely no guarantee that the consumer will see even one penny of this tax reduction at the gas pump,'' said Senator Robert C. Byrd, the ranking Democrat on the appropriations committee, who called the measure ''nefarious.''</p>
        <p>Countering conventional wisdom, Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said gasoline prices were not high. In fact, taking inflation into account, motorists are paying one-third less today than they were in 1981. ''We are not paying more for gasoline,'' he said. ''We are paying less for it.''</p>
        <p>The federal gasoline tax is actually 18.4 cents a gallon, but Mr. Abraham's amendment protected the 0.1 cent earmarked for underground fuel storage.</p>
        <p>Despite attempts by some Republican leaders to win support for a repeal of the federal gasoline tax, the Senate has been reluctant to embrace the move, regardless of political appeal. In April, the Senate voted to reject the repeal of a 4.3 cent surcharge on the gasoline excise tax.</p>
        <p>The gasoline-tax suspension was one of a long series of amendments offered to a bill that would repeal the federal estate tax.</p>
        <p>The Senate adopted a number of election-year tax breaks in the form of amendments to the bill as it debated into the night. They included repeal of the 3 percent federal excise tax on telephone calls, the creation of tax-advantaged savings accounts for farmers and the permanent extension of tax credits to corporations for their research and experimentation costs.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders said they planned a final vote on the estate tax repeal for Friday.</p>
