        <p>THE thick, wet aroma yanks at the nostrils, a scent to warm the heart of any meat lover. At that point you have been hearing rhapsodies about food from hungry people for so long that you may well think you have imagined it. After all, plays don't usually smell, except metaphorically.</p>
        <p>But no, that seems to be real boiled beef being dished out in the Maly Theater's robust two-part production of ''Brothers and Sisters,'' which runs through this weekend at the John Jay College Theater as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000. Your disbelief at this sudden olfactory invasion is mirrored in the faces of the actors onstage, whose expressions are those of people afraid to wake up from a wonderful, improbable dream.</p>
        <p>None of the five senses feel safe from assault in ''Brothers and Sisters,'' adapted from a trilogy known as ''The Prysalins,'' by the Russian novelist Fyodor Abramov. The scene just described portrays a rare celebratory feast in a postwar Soviet village, and it has been arranged for a cow on the collective farm to have an accident. Those gristly, gray hunks of meat may not be pretty, but it's hard not to taste them vicariously or to be transported by gratitude, even if you're a vegetarian.</p>
        <p>The notion of appetite looms large during the more than six hours of this tale of hope and privation in the land of Stalin, which has been staged by the Maly's fabled artistic director, Lev Dodin, and was first seen in Moscow 15 years ago. Appetite is the central word in a ribald joke told early in the play by one naked young man to another in a sauna; it is also what keeps the play's portrait of unending hardship from seeming arid or depressing.</p>
        <p>Hunger of many varieties is painful and destructive here, but the urge to satisfy it comes across as bracingly dynamic. It whets the senses instead of numbing them, suggesting that the pleasures of the flesh are never more appreciated than in their absence. The image of a perfectly formed loaf of bread assumes, in this context, a voluptuousness you would never have thought possible.</p>
        <p>The 36 Maly performers, most of whom have been with the production since its inception and performed it in more than a dozen other countries, have that second-skin connection with their roles that is born of long association. More surprisingly, their fervor is that of actors who have just discovered the hidden keys to their parts.</p>
        <p>The result is a densely textured, overwhelmingly physical production that has the hypnotic hold of a fat, fine historical novel. Not that the literary merits of the text -- spoken in Russian with projected English supertitles -- gleam on their own. Simply to quote from the script, adapted from Abramov's novel by Mr. Dodin, Sergei Bekhterev and Arkady Katsman, is not to do the play any favors.</p>
        <p>Much of the dialogue, to American ears, verges on a parody of the dark gray Russian angst of Dostoyevsky and Chekhov. The evening's early scenes feature characters remarking that spring feels ''worn out,'' that even the birds sound weary. And here is a typical lament wailed toward the drama's end: ''Why do we waste our lives and constantly deprive ourselves of happiness?''</p>
        <p>You might also reasonably wonder just how much excitement can be mined from heated discussions of party policy on the distribution of grain, the subject of much of the play's second half.</p>
        <p>This, however, is to ignore the purely theatrical engine that gives the production its locomotive strength. Mr. Dodin has a sure and powerful sense of both narrative momentum and the grand, goose-bump-inspiring set piece. (Had the Maly company under Mr. Dodin been responsible for Stalin's propaganda films, Soviet history might read differently.)</p>
        <p>And playing characters who might seem like stick figures on the page, the Maly actors provide compelling emotional detail. Every face is stamped with a deeply individual response to a shared history, and you are unlikely to mistake one of the work's 40-odd characters for another.</p>
        <p>That this production has now assumed a legendary quality has something to do with the timing of its birth. Its opening in March 1985, on the eve of Mikhail Gorbachev's coming to power, made it a talismanic work for many Russians, a preface to glasnost.</p>
        <p>That association has caused some critics (including a reviewer for a Moscow paper who sat next to me the other night) to argue that ''Brothers'' is dated now, a relic of the so-called Socialist Realism to which the play would seem to subscribe even as it subverts it.</p>
        <p>But that is to deny the work's fierce pull as a piece of storytelling and its crafty manipulation of the appeal of being involved with other lives that makes gossips of us all. Indeed, in its compelling anatomies of alliances and betrayals in a tight-knit community where everyone is closely watched, ''Brothers'' can be savored as a sort of collective farm version of ''Peyton Place.'' You simply want to know what happens to everyone next.</p>
        <p>The short and unsatisfactory answer to that question is wholesale disillusionment. ''Brothers'' begins with the women of Pekashino looking forward to the return of their men from World War II and to an era in which, in a phrase repeated with increasing dissonance, they will be able ''to eat their fill.'' Most of the men never come back, however, and the postwar bureaucracy of collective farming will keep the villagers hungry for many years to come.</p>
        <p>Within this framework, the drama focuses on two central characters: Mikhail Pryaslin (Pyotr Semak), who was a boy when the war began and has stayed behind, assuming a grown man's responsibilities, and Anfisa Petrovna Minina (Tatyana Shestakova), who has headed the collective farm during the war.</p>
        <p>The fortunes of these two are inescapably tied in with those of the village. The play accordingly unfolds as a study in the friction between public and private, between individual and collective morality and responsibility. It is hard to think of a director more expert, or successfully shameless, than Mr. Dodin in manipulating these contrasts and in conveying the consuming pull of the crowd.</p>
        <p>At moments, the production seems like an animated version of those famous propaganda posters of the Stalin era, as smiling women in babushkas toss grain in synchronized movement while singing. The implicit optimism of such scenes is given the lie by other group tableaux in which the cast stands frozen in grim postures of sorely tested patience.</p>
        <p>The set designer, Eduard Kochergin, has created a world that looks to have been hewn in rough wood, with a suspended, mobile central wall of logs and an immense gate that opens to swing out over the audience. These two basic elements, splendidly enhanced by Oleg Kozlov's lighting, define every shift of scene, conjuring both hard realities and airborne fantasies, both claustrophobic confinement and tantalizing openness.</p>
        <p>The sense of a visceral reality in which the audience is meant to share is insisted upon throughout. Actors are often found in the theater's aisles, bustling through with sheafs of twigs or armloads of hay. (The hay is as evocatively aromatic, in its own way, as the boiled beef.) We are, in effect, the larger village beyond their meeting places, and when the political gatherings are held, we feel uncomfortably implicit in the ways the crowd turns on its own.</p>
        <p>The sexually segregated group scenes are marvelous, especially those in which the women without men sexually bait and tease one another, eventually falling into one wriggling mass of giddiness. Equally rousing are the drunken party scenes, in which ecstasy is only a hair's breadth from abysmal despair.</p>
        <p>The great strength of the cast, as of so many good Russian actors, is in its ability to convey both extremes of emotion at once. This sensibility is fine-tuned with exquisite variations in the more intimate scenes.</p>
        <p>One thinks especially of two brilliant, largely wordless sequences centered on the return of Anfisa's first husband, Grigory (Vladimir Artyomov), from the war, when the distribution of luxury gifts assumes tragicomic dimensions. There is also the hauntingly erotic moment in which horseplay between the widow Varvara (the luscious Natalya Fomenko) and the young Mikhail turns serious.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shestakova, who has the waif ish gravity of Giulietta Masina, and the open-faced Mr. Semak provide affecting maps of instinctive integrity worn down by circumstance. I also particularly enjoyed Sergei Vlasov as Mikhail's ambitious, self-glamorizing friend, who becomes a tractor-driving advertisement for the Communist Youth League. And the honey-and-butter-skinned Ms. Fomenko, who suggests a Slavic answer to Sophia Loren, gives the work an essential sexuality that pervades the entire production like a brisk perfume.</p>
        <p>You will surely long remember the extraordinary imagistic use that is made of bread. There is the loaf that Mikhail, freshly returned from a logging camp, solemnly unwraps before his awe-struck family, and the golden, seemingly self-replenishing bread that figures in the heartbreaking fantasy sequence that concludes the first evening.</p>
        <p>Then there are the sacks of grain, representing months of labor by the villagers, that are raised into the air, like effigies on a floating temple, before disappearing. It is perhaps the cruelest moment of dashed hopes in an evening that specializes in such disappointments, a harbinger of another long season of near-starvation. You share in the villagers' sensations here. This is definitely not to say that you leave this production hungry.</p>
