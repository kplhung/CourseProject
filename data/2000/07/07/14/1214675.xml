        <p>All About My Mother</p>
        <p>Pedro Almodovar's complex film takes what he has called ''screwball drama'' to a more deeply felt level. When Manuela (Cecilia Roth) sees her son run down in the street, she leaves his heart beating in another man's body and goes off to refigure life with a variety of iconoclastic women. These include a nun played by Penelope Cruz (above) and the irrepressible transsexual actor Agrado (Antonia San Juan), an old friend of Manuela since the days before Agrado had breasts. ''Mr. Almodovar has expressed the idea of acting as a divine form of life before,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ''but never with the kind of clarity and beauty that glitter here.''</p>
        <p>1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $99.36; DVD, $29.95. 100 minutes. Spanish with English subtitles. R.</p>
        <p>Angela's Ashes</p>
        <p>The very grimness of the poverty in Alan Parker's film, adapted from Frank McCourt's celebrated book about his brutal Irish upbringing, oddly contrasts with the lush beauty of its cinematography and a tidily controlled palette that keeps real suffering at bay. Jammed into tiny, waterlogged quarters in Limerick, Ireland, the family of Malachy McCourt, a charming and caring drunk, exists on little food and not much of anything else, including shoes, while Malachy fails at any work he tries. But with due respect to the pain described here, ''the film isn't wrenching enough to do it justice'' (Maslin).</p>
        <p>1999. Paramount. $107.37; DVD, $29.99. 120 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: July 18.</p>
        <p>The Whole Nine Yards</p>
        <p>A nice-guy dentist named Oz (Matthew Perry) browbeaten by his wife (Rosanna Arquette) and nasty mother-in-law is further rattled by Jimmy (the Tulip) Tudeski (Bruce Willis), a former Chicago organized-crime figure who moves in next door. Jimmy, as breezily confident as Oz is anxiety-ridden, stirs the suburban pot with hit men, love interests and large sums of money. But while Mr. Perry shows a knack for slapstick, Jonathan Lynn's film remains ''underwhelming, amusing only in fits and starts'' (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2000. Warner. $108.97; DVD, $24.98. 101 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: July 18.</p>
        <p>Isn't She Great</p>
        <p>Probably the best line to sum up Jacqueline Susann (Bette Midler) in Andrew Bergman's bio-pic comes from Jackie's best friend (Stockard Channing): ''Talent isn't everything.'' Competence is another matter. Jackie banged out her humid sex-and-drug adventures -- ''Valley of the Dolls,'' ''The Love Machine'' -- with game efficiency. Ms. Midler is perfectly equipped to give color to the character, but she is stymied by a film that only makes Ms. Susann's life campy and crude. ''It's not that there's no talent among the collaborators; it's just that no one gets much of a chance to show it'' (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2000. Universal. $107.37; DVD, $24.98. 90 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: July 18.</p>
        <p>Straight to Video</p>
        <p>Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.</p>
        <p>SPIDERS and THE THOUSAND EYES OF DR. MABUSE. New editions of one of Fritz Lang's earliest films and his last one find the director in his thriller mode. Inspired by the serials of Louis Feuillade, ''Spiders'' (1919, 137 minutes) stars Carl de Vogt as the adventurer Kay Hoog, who finds a note in a bottle from an anthropologist being held captive by South American Indians. There's Incan treasure to locate, a spider cult to avoid and a treacherous femme fatale (Ressel Orla) to best. (Indiana Jones, anybody? Well, sort of.) For ''The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse'' (1960), Lang resurrected his master criminal Dr. Mabuse for a latter-day and rather convoluted international conspiracy (and here everybody thought Mabuse had died in the 30's). Kino. $24.95 each. Information: (800) 562-3330.</p>
        <p>LATE AUGUST, EARLY SEPTEMBER. Olivier Assayas's film involves the death of a middle-aged man, but the treatment concentrates on myopic egos and changing relationships rather than morbidity or pain. ''If Mr. Assayas doesn't always transport his film's events beyond the all-too-commonplace,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ''his understatement can also yield moments of quieter simplicity.'' 1999. $89.99. 105 minutes. French with English subtitles. No rating.</p>
        <p>DIVINE TRASH. Steve Yeager's documentary looks at the early career of John Waters and his collaboration with Divine in ''Pink Flamingos.'' 1998. $19.98; DVD, $24.98. 105 minutes. No rating.</p>
