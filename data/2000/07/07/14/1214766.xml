        <p>The war by fund-raising letter between the Senate candidates reached new heights of bitterness yesterday with a missive from the state Republican Party chairman that called Hillary Rodham Clinton ''cold blooded and hot headed'' and ''abrasive and annoying, brash and bitter, calculating and scheming, distant and deceitful, polarizing and power hungry.''</p>
        <p>Did he mean it?</p>
        <p>''She doesn't care about the families of New York, and our letter just tells it like it is,'' said William Powers, the chairman, in a follow-up statement to the news media after reports of the letter, sent to 100,000 Republicans, became public. The statement went on to say ''she's lying when she calls herself a New Yorker because she's not one of us -- she's never sent her kids to our schools, voted in our elections or even paid property taxes here.''</p>
        <p>The Clinton campaign shot back quickly, unleashing a new weapon -- a video clip of an interview in which Mrs. Clinton's opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, seemed to distance himself from a fund-raising letter that called Mrs. Clinton an embarrassment to the country. The video clip, accompanied by a statement, was e-mailed to members of the news media.</p>
        <p>''Last week Rick Lazio refused to accept responsibility for his own negative fund-raising letter,'' said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. ''Today he should stop offering excuses, disown this latest attack mail, and tell the people of New York that he won't allow a dime raised by it to be used in this campaign.''</p>
        <p>The heated exchanges, mainly between the candidates' surrogates, have grown sharper than the candidates' typically pointed remarks about each other on the trail. Yesterday, each side blamed the other for the negative tone.</p>
        <p>The Lazio campaign said the state Democratic Party chairwoman, Judith Hope, had sent out a fund-raising letter that accused Mr. Lazio of supporting ''the harshest reductions in school funding in our history,'' an assertion that drew a quick denial from Mr. Lazio's campaign staff.</p>
        <p>And Mrs. Clinton tried again to cast Mr. Lazio's campaign as largely negative. ''I think it shows again that their idea of a campaign is a campaign of insults and my idea is a campaign of issues,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Michael Marr, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, said, ''Mrs. Clinton should be worried about cleaning up her own house before lashing out at other people's houses.'' Mrs. Hope's letter, Mr. Marr said, was ''filled with inaccuracies.'' He also said Mr. Powers's  letter was written without the cooperation of Mr. Lazio's staff.</p>
