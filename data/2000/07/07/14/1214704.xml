        <p>Do you want to avoid paying taxes? If you're a MediaOne shareholder, that tax aversion could prove very costly.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T's takeover has already taken effect, but only now are shareholders of MediaOne, the cable television company, having to decide what they will be paid. Those who decide to minimize the tax hit will do so, but at a considerable cost.</p>
        <p>That is because AT&amp;T is offering MediaOne shareholders three choices of compensation, varying in the amount of AT&amp;T stock and cash that will be received. The deadline for shareholders to make their choice is today.</p>
        <p>The smallest immediate tax hit will come for shareholders who choose to take as much of their compensation as possible in AT&amp;T stock. Those shareholders will receive 1.4912 shares of AT&amp;T plus $8.50 in cash for each share of MediaOne they tender. Because the shares are not taxable now -- in tax jargon, the cost of the MediaOne shares carries over to the cost of the AT&amp;T shares -- those holders would pay tax only on $8.50 in cash, or perhaps on less, depending on the profit recorded on the MediaOne shares, which is based on what the investor paid for the shares.</p>
        <p>The catch is that that offer is not worth nearly as much as the other offers available. At AT&amp;T's stock price of $33.75 that offer is worth only $58.83 for each MediaOne share.</p>
        <p>By far the best alternative for shareholders would be an all-cash offer of $85 a share, which will not actually bring that much cash but will provide more cash than either of the other offers. The other alternative is an offer of 0.95 share of AT&amp;T, plus $36.27 in cash, for each MediaOne share. That has a value of $68.33 at current prices and is close to what investors will actually receive if they choose the cash version.</p>
        <p>That is true because AT&amp;T has fixed what it will pay -- about $23 billion in cash and 606 million shares -- and the shareholder elections will simply decide how the cash and stock are divided up. If everyone chose the same option, all would end up with the blended deal, which AT&amp;T calls the standard election.</p>
        <p>One reason that the number of shares tendered for stock could be unusually high is MediaOne's history. It was spun off in 1995 from U S West, which itself was spun off from AT&amp;T when the phone company was broken up in 1984. Like all the companies that were spun off from AT&amp;T, it has a lot of individual holders, many of whom own small positions.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T will not give details on the results thus far, but Connie Weaver, AT&amp;T's vice president for investor relations, says, ''People are taking all three of the options.'' She said MediaOne had about 800,000 investors.</p>
        <p>Why would anyone choose the clearly inferior offer that contains mostly stock? One reason may be that brokerage firms are not offering much advice. PaineWebber put out a report saying the cash option was clearly the most valuable, but other firms seem not to have done so.</p>
        <p>''We're not advising, because it depends on the individual's tax situation,'' said Megan Kulick, a telecommunications analyst for Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>In fact, it is hard to imagine any investor who would be better off to take the stock deal. Someone who took the blended deal and had a low enough cost of MediaOne stock to owe taxes on all the cash received -- meaning that investor paid less than $30.40 each for their shares in MediaOne -- and who owed combined federal and state capital gains taxes of 25 percent, would still have an after-tax value of $59.27 a share, compared with $56.70 for the investor who took the primarily stock package.</p>
        <p>An investor who did want to own more AT&amp;T could take the cash and buy more AT&amp;T shares than the stock offering would provide. And that investor would owe less taxes later when the AT&amp;T shares were sold.</p>
        <p>The two packages are so disparate in large part because AT&amp;T stock has been a poor performer since the deal was announced on May 6 last year. Its shares are trading for just over half the $61.9375 they were worth then, the result of a series of corporate disappointments.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the lure of simplicity and tax savings is likely to make at least some shareholders choose the stock alternative. When they do, the beneficiaries of that decision will be the other owners of MediaOne stock, who will get more cash and less AT&amp;T stock than they otherwise would have received. Those owners will include institutional investors and the risk arbitrage departments of some of the very firms that seem hesitant to offer advice to their customers.</p>
