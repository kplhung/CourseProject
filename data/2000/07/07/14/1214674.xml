        <p>At its annual meeting in Las Vegas last week, the video business acknowledged DVD -- a format that some in the industry have had their reservations about -- as its most positive development. It doesn't take a convention to gauge the rise of the disc and its player, about 13 million of which could be in use by early next year. On the release horizon, hundreds of films wait to join the current DVD inventory of about 6,500 movie and music titles.</p>
        <p>In true more-is-more spirit, the biggest and the splashiest of them -- usually meaning the ones with the most special effects -- are so jammed with extra features that they threaten to spill right off the disc.

        <p>At its annual meeting in Las Vegas last week, the video business acknowledged DVD -- a format that some in the industry have had their reservations about -- as its most positive development. It doesn't take a convention to gauge the rise of the disc and its player, about 13 million of which could be in use by early next year. On the release horizon, hundreds of films wait to join the current DVD inventory of about 6,500 movie and music titles.</p>
        <p>In true more-is-more spirit, the biggest and the splashiest of them -- usually meaning the ones with the most special effects -- are so jammed with extra features that they threaten to spill right off the disc. DVD makers used to revel in all the room they had, but now they wonder how to get everything onto two-disc editions or the new ''18'' (for gigabytes) dual-layered, two-sided discs.</p>
        <p>Like the old laser discs, 18's will have to be flipped, something early DVD developers said should not happen. They also take longer to replicate, which can help delay special editions and in some cases force studios to issue one disc that is light on extras at the time the videocassette appears and another one later with all the features added. ''You have to be very careful consumers know another edition is coming along,'' said Jonathan Gaines of Acoustic Visions, a Los Angeles company that helps produce discs for the movie studios.</p>
        <p>One habitual space-grabber, as it was on laser disc, is ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day,'' the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle directed by James Cameron. Action-movie buffs always seem to be up for still more ''T2,'' as it's called by grateful distributors, and next month a DVD 18 edition from Artisan will carry three complete versions of the film: the one that ran in theaters, another with 15 minutes added and another with five minutes on top of that. All this before the added features, which number more than 40, from documentaries (three) to production stills.</p>
        <p>Just released by Fox, ''Independence Day'' fills the first of two discs (one-sided) with the original film and another version of it with nine minutes of material restored; a commentary by Roland Emmerich, the director, and Dean Devlin, the producer and co-writer; and another commentary from the effects supervisors. All the other extras, including a 33-minute ''featurette'' (DVD-ese for various pieces of film about the film), is left for the second disc.</p>
        <p>Not all DVD's come so fully packed, of course. For example, it is a relief to encounter ''The Woody Allen Collection,'' available this week from MGM. Eight Allen films -- ''Annie Hall,'' ''Bananas,'' ''Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but Were Afraid to Ask,'' ''Interiors,'' ''Love and Death,'' ''Manhattan,'' ''Sleeper'' and ''Stardust Memories'' -- are accompanied by just two extras each: a trailer for the film and an informative four-page circular inserted in the disc case.</p>
        <p>DVD's often are dependent on the director to provide extras, which some do by the trunkful. Mr. Allen is said to feel no such urge.</p>
