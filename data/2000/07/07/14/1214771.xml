        <p>As Gov. Christine Todd Whitman tried to quell criticism of her decision to  frisk a black man in Camden while riding with the New Jersey state police in 1996, the former head of the state police came forward today to chastise the governor.</p>
        <p>The former State Police superintendent, Carl A. Williams, called a news conference to make the politically volatile assertion that Mrs. Whitman had two of her top legal advisers by her side at the time of the search: Deborah T. Poritz, who was then attorney general, and Peter G. Verniero, who was Mrs. Whitman's chief of staff. Ms. Poritz is now the chief justice of New Jersey's Supreme Court and Mr. Verniero is a State Supreme Court justice.</p>

        <p>As Gov. Christine Todd Whitman tried to quell criticism of her decision to  frisk a black man in Camden while riding with the New Jersey state police in 1996, the former head of the state police came forward today to chastise the governor.</p>
        <p>The former State Police superintendent, Carl A. Williams, called a news conference to make the politically volatile assertion that Mrs. Whitman had two of her top legal advisers by her side at the time of the search: Deborah T. Poritz, who was then attorney general, and Peter G. Verniero, who was Mrs. Whitman's chief of staff. Ms. Poritz is now the chief justice of New Jersey's Supreme Court and Mr. Verniero is a State Supreme Court justice.</p>
        <p>But a spokesman for the Administrative Office of the Courts issued a statement today saying that neither was with the governor that night. And as she left an appearance today at Rutgers University,  Mrs. Whitman said that neither Mr.  Verniero nor Ms. Poritz had been with her during the search.</p>
        <p>The governor has come under heavy criticism from civil rights leaders and some Democrats since a photo that a trooper took of the frisking was made public last week by The Associated Press. The photo appears to show the governor smiling as she pats down a young black man, who the state police say was stopped for ''suspicious activity'' and then released.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Williams -- whom the governor forced to resign last year for making racially insensitive statements during a newspaper interview -- said he had opposed Mrs. Whitman's plan to ride along with troopers in Camden's violent streets because he feared for her safety. Mr. Williams said he spent the night at a command center a few blocks away from where the governor was traveling in a van and did not know about the governor's hands-on involvement in the frisk until several months ago, when he was told that it had been photographed.</p>
        <p>Many legal experts say the governor's actions may have been illegal because the man had already been frisked by troopers and was not found to be violating the law, so he should have been released without another search.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams would not venture an opinion on the legality of her actions, but he clearly savored the opportunity to criticize the racial sensitivity of the governor, whom he sued -- along with Mr. Verniero -- for his removal. Last week, a state judge threw out the main charges in Mr. Williams's lawsuit.</p>
        <p>''I think it was a very insensitive thing to do,'' Mr. Williams said of the frisking. ''I think an apology is in order -- definitely an apology to the New Jersey State Police for  putting them into this situation again. It looks like our problem.''</p>
        <p>The governor, who has been trying to put the issue behind her,  attended several ceremonies today, including a fund-raiser tonight with Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate.</p>
