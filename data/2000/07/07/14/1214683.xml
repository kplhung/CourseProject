        <p>WHEN people ask Michael Whitesel about his Aunt Emily at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance next month, he'll have all the answers. She has been part of his family for four generations.</p>
        <p>''Aunt Emily'' is a concours judge's term to describe huge, stately conveyances that are sensible rather than sexy. Mr. Whitesel's imposing aunt is a 1919 Cunningham limousine that his great-grandfather bought new in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>The Cunningham certainly was sensible, in an imposing way. The black-and-maroon giant is nearly 7 feet tall and 20 feet long. It has survived more than 100,000 miles on mountainous gravel roads in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
        <p>But it is especially noteworthy for having been in the same family for nearly 81 years.</p>
        <p>''That's what makes this car such an interesting story,'' said Glenn Mounger, co-chairman of the Pebble Beach concours, an annual event in California that is widely considered the most important collector-car show in the world. ''We get one-family cars presented from the 1950's and occasionally the 40's, but to get a car out of the teens from the same family is very rare.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mounger brought the car to the attention of the Pebble Beach selection committee, which invited Mr. Whitesel to this year's 50th-anniversary concours, set for Aug. 20.</p>
        <p>The opulent oceanfront Lodge at Pebble Beach is far removed from the Cunningham's rough-and-tumble domain in Wallace, Idaho, a mining town that was the backdrop for the film ''Dante's Peak.''</p>
        <p>When Model T Fords sold for $525, Mr. Whitesel's great-grandfather, Harry L. Day, paid cash for a car that cost 14 times as much: a Cunningham Model 64 limousine with a separate, covered driver's compartment. Mr. Whitesel still has the canceled check for $7,468.75, dated Jan. 26, 1920.</p>
        <p>Day could afford it. His family owned the Hercules and Tamarack silver mines, Idaho's biggest. From 1901 to 1925, the Hercules alone yielded dividends estimated at nearly $20 million and at one point produced 6 percent of the nation's lead.</p>
        <p>Day Mines reported wartime dividends of $2.9 million in 1916 and $3.6 million in 1917, and although they dipped to $500,000 at the war's end, the future must have seemed bright -- bright enough that when he decided to buy a new automobile, he chose one of the most handsome and expensive brands in America.</p>
        <p>Starting in 1907, Cunningham, of Rochester, assembled vehicles with Buffalo or Continental engines and then, in 1911, its own four-cylinder units. But the company vaulted into the luxury class with its V-8 of 1916, the same year it ceased making horse-drawn carriages. Initially rated at 45 horsepower, the 442-cubic-inch flathead engine (twice the displacement of Ford's famous V-8 of 1932) was tweaked by the late 1920's to produce 110 horsepower. Customers could choose two sizes of cars, with wheelbases of either 132 or, like Mr. Whitesel's car, 142 inches.</p>
        <p>In all, Cunningham made cars from 1907 to 1936 (though the last few years involved supplying custom bodies for Ford chassis). Production ran as high as 200 cars a year, and at least 38 are known to have survived.</p>
        <p>Cunningham did not bother with a dealer network. If you wanted a car, you ordered it from the factory. Harry Day, who had joined the exclusive Bohemian Club in San Francisco, ordered his through the company's agent in that city.</p>
        <p>Cunninghams changed little from year to year, which suited their conservative customers. And if the buyers were finicky, the company was more so, urging owners not to allow local garages to work on the cars. If necessary, the factory would send a mechanic by train to make repairs.</p>
        <p>When silver and lead prices plummeted with the Depression and mining was halted, the car's 1932 license plates were not renewed. The car was parked in a warehouse.</p>
        <p>Henry L. Day, Harry's son, took over Day Mines Inc., and capitalized on his analysis of the family empire, the subject of his thesis for a degree at Harvard. He consolidated the company holdings, buying less successful competitors, and by the end of World War II owned 719 mining claims.</p>
        <p>The Cunningham was forgotten until the early 1970's, when a local newspaper article led to a stream of interested buyers. Henry, by then 71 years old, decided to have the car restored. He contacted Bob Larrabee in Clarkston, Wash., and a lively correspondence followed. The work began in 1974 at Mr. Larrabee's shop rate of $9 an hour.</p>
        <p>Mr. Larrabee, 65, recently recalled the job. ''It had been sitting in a damp building since 1932,'' he said. ''Everything was rusted and gummed up. The wheels wouldn't turn; the motor wouldn't turn. The tires were flat and falling apart.''</p>
        <p>The project turned into a total ''frame off'' restoration. The shop replaced woodwork and completely rebuilt the engine, transmission and rear axle. The interior was usable after minor repairs were made.</p>
        <p>''There were no parts for Cunninghams,'' Mr. Larrabee said. ''Everything was a challenge. We recast door handles, machined everything ourselves.''</p>
        <p>His original estimate for the job was $5,300; Day's records show that the final figure was $20,027.69. But the men's relations remained cordial even as the bill soared, and Mr. Larrabee kept a detailed record book with photographs of each stage of the work. Day wrote to tell the restorer how proud he was of the finished product.</p>
        <p>''Henry approved everything,'' Mr. Larrabee recalled. ''He came down three or four times that year and sometimes brought relatives with him. When the car was completed he had me deliver it to Spokane, and I rode with him to Coeur d'Alene.''</p>
        <p>Shortly after the Cunningham was finished, Mr. Whitesel, who is Henry Day's grandson, fell in love with the huge old car -- proving the adage that a collectible car can be defined as something you rode in between the ages of 5 and 15.</p>
        <p>''I was 8 or 9 years old,'' said Mr. Whitesel, who is now 32 and lives here. ''I remember he took us all for rides. Then, in 1983, I rode with him in the Wallace centennial parade.''</p>
        <p>Henry Day died in 1985 and Mr. Whitesel's mother had the car appraised, planning to sell it. Its value was estimated at $40,000.</p>
        <p>''I was 17,'' Mr. Whitesel recalled. ''I begged her not to sell it. I said, 'I'll do anything!' Mom agreed that if I arranged insurance and storage, she wouldn't sell the car.</p>
        <p>''I kept it in a parking garage for a year, then in a museum in Coeur d'Alene, then in an airplane hangar, then two and a half years ago I shipped it to Portland.''</p>
        <p>He plans to keep the car and share it with the public when possible, at events like Pebble Beach. ''I'm not much of a knuckle-basher, but I have a fascination with it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And he still enjoys being a passenger. For his wedding, in April 1997, he hired a chauffeur. He and his bride left the church in the back of the maroon-and-black Cunningham.</p>
