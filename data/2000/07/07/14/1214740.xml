        <p>The top executive of Russia's national electric monopoly capitulated to shareholder opposition today and drastically altered a reorganization plan for the company.</p>
        <p>Under a new proposal by the executive, Anatoly B. Chubais, any reorganization of the utility, the Unified Energy System, will accommodate nearly all shareholder demands.</p>
        <p>This represented a major turnaround for Mr. Chubais, a former Russian first deputy prime minister and free-market economic reformer. He has been locked in conflict with the shareholders since April, when he first presented his plan to break up the aging power company.</p>
        <p>Investors, including some prominent foreign shareholders, fought the plan, saying it would destroy the value of their stock and lead to a fire sale of Unified Energy's assets. Some had pushed for a special shareholders meeting to oust Mr. Chubais.</p>
        <p>Once a close ally of foreign investors in Russia, Mr. Chubais has come under attack this year for the plan to revamp the Soviet-era electric company. A prime architect of Russia's program in the mid-90's to sell state assets -- which left a handful of people owning much of the country's wealth -- Mr. Chubais was appointed in 1998 to run the electric company by President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
        <p>Tonight, at a briefing, Mr. Chubais said his new proposal for the utility would merge regional power companies and national power stations into about 15 generating companies, instead of the 70 he proposed earlier.</p>
        <p>In addition, Unified Energy will wait two or three years before selling assets to give low tariffs a chance to rise and the government time to free up the highly regulated Russian energy market.</p>
        <p>Investors welcomed the announcement, but said they wanted to see concrete steps. ''It's a big change but there has been a serious breakdown in trust,'' said Mark Cooke, fund manager at Brunswick Capital Management, which has $350 million in this country. ''Fine words are one thing, but implementation is another.''</p>
        <p>Russia's power industry badly needs new investment. Equipment has been creaky and outdated. Regional power companies continue to use old generators, leaving more efficient generators at the national power stations idle or underused.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chubais has been under pressure from all sides. Last week, members of Parliament joined foreign investors in calling for a halt to his restructuring plans.</p>
        <p>Today, the Interfax news agency reported that Russia's Audit Chamber, the official auditor, said it had discovered a number of legal violations by Unified Energy beginning in 1992, and was investigating whether the company had the right to sell shares to foreigners.</p>
