        <p>This is a 30-second commercial released yesterday by the campaign of Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for United States Senate, called ''Know.'' With it, Mr. Lazio does what many politicians in New York have been waiting for Hillary Rodham Clinton to do: enlist the spouse for a television advertisements.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- A steady close-up of Patricia Lazio, Mr. Lazio's wife, with what appear to be roses in the background. As she finishes speaking she introduces herself, and her name flashes on the screen. The ad ends with an image of Mr. and Mrs. Lazio walking on the beach with their two children.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Mrs. Lazio: ''It's a shame, but Mrs. Clinton's campaign isn't telling it straight about Rick Lazio and health care. The fact is Rick Lazio has won awards for his work in Congress to help cancer patients. Rick voted for a patients' bill of rights,  and Rick just helped pass new legislation to help seniors afford their prescription drugs. Why do I care so much about health care? I'm a registered nurse. And how do I know so much about Rick Lazio? He's my husband.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio have been involved in a fairly selective reading of Mr. Lazio's record on health care legislation in recent weeks. Mrs. Clinton has attacked Mr. Lazio for voting against a bill that would have given patients the right to sue their health maintenance organizations. The bill Mrs. Lazio cites in her husband's defense was a Republican version of legislation regulating H.M.O.'s. Similarly, Mr. Lazio opposed a Democratic bill to subsidize prescription drug bills for the elderly, but supported a less generous Republican bill.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mrs. Lazio has been an almost constant presence at Mr. Lazio's side during these first six weeks of his campaign, so it was probably inevitable that she would show up in a commercial. She provides a soft edge to a sharp attack, and offers a solution to one of Mr. Lazio's political problems: how to attack a female opponent. In this case, it is an issue that Mrs. Clinton has seized on, and which promises to be central in the campaign ahead.</p>
