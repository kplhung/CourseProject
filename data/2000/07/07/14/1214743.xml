        <p>Mark Messier stood on the podium at Madison Square Garden yesterday morning during his reintroduction to New York and the Rangers, but he could not speak.</p>
        <p>The tears flowing down Messier's face spoke for him instead.</p>
        <p>''Once again, I've embarrassed myself in front of millions of people in America and Canada by crying,'' the always emotional Messier finally blurted out, along with an attempt at a laugh.</p>
        <p>There may be no crying in other sports. But there is obviously room for it in hockey, perhaps the toughest of them all. And yesterday, the tears shed by Messier were those of joy.</p>
        <p>The man with the shaven head, legendary stare and jutted jaw had just donned his red-white-and-blue No. 11 sweater, with the captain's ''C'' freshly stitched back on, for the first time in more than  three years. Not long before, Messier had signed a two-year contract for a base total of $11 million to guarantee his return.</p>
        <p>But there had to be tears of regret mixed in, too, for someone who really needed no introduction to even the most casual of New York sports fans. The Rangers have endured three seasons without a playoff berth since Messier parted ways with the Rangers on July 28, 1997. Three long years of what-could-have-beens played out to boos on Garden ice.</p>
        <p>At age 39 -- and after enduring three playoff-less seasons of his own in Vancouver -- Messier now returns to the same Broadway stage that he once owned like no other hockey player before or since.</p>
        <p>This time, it is for a long-anticipated second act. ''I'm not here to retire,'' Messier defiantly vowed, once all his emotions had been contained. ''I'm here to win, to play well, to do all the things I have done in the past.''</p>
        <p>Messier was brought back to New York for one purpose above all others.</p>
        <p>''In one conversation we had, Mark said to me he may not be able to carry a team to the Stanley Cup, but he can certainly lead,'' said Glen Sather, the Rangers' new president and general manager. ''And leading is what I'm looking for.''</p>
        <p>One of Messier's first acts as the Rangers' new captain yesterday was to issue another of his guarantees.</p>
        <p>''I guarantee we're going to make the playoffs,'' he said. ''We all know where this franchise should be, where it's been and where we're going to take it again.''</p>
        <p>Messier has made a career out of backing up his words. Game 6 of the 1994 Eastern Conference finals immediately comes to mind, when Messier not only promised a victory over the Devils but delivered it with a hat trick.</p>
        <p>Given how successful Messier's first act with the Rangers was, someone questioned yesterday the wisdom of his even attempting a second one.</p>
        <p>''There wasn't a successful stint in New York for 54 years before I got here,'' Messier shot back, referring to the Stanley Cup he helped the Rangers win in 1994. ''Nobody knows what tomorrow will bring. That's what we're here for.''</p>
        <p>One day earlier, Ron Low had been introduced as the Rangers' new coach. But this is clearly Messier's team. And town. Again.</p>
        <p>Dave Checketts, the Garden president, indicated that he first began to truly understand the significance Messier had in New York on the day Wayne Gretzky retired, in April 1999. Almost two years earlier, when Messier left for Vancouver, Checketts said something in an interview that stung Rangers fans to their core.</p>
        <p>''How long should we pay for that cup?'' Checketts said, words he now regrets.</p>
        <p>''I think we all make mistakes,'' Checketts said yesterday. ''But the past is the past and today is moving on. I've had very few moments in 10 years at the Garden as special as what we just experienced. I'm just glad he's back. It was probably a long time overdue.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers went so far as to import some genuine sod in a glass tank, along with a pair of shovels, so that Messier and Checketts could bury a hatchet, both literally and figuratively.</p>
        <p>''Mark Messier has become synonymous with New York like few other modern-day athletes with any city,'' Checketts said before the burying began. ''He has arguably meant more to the Rangers' sweater than anyone who has ever worn it.''</p>
        <p>It was obvious yesterday how much Messier still means to his only three teammates who remain from 1994. Brian Leetch, Mike Richter and Adam Graves were all in attendance. Leetch even made light of his passing back the captaincy to Messier.</p>
        <p>''I was concerned that Mark might become a problem in the locker room if we didn't make that move,'' joked Leetch, who seemed more at ease yesterday than during any of the last three years when he carried the weight of the ''C'' on his sweater.</p>
        <p>''This team is a veteran team,'' Leetch said, this time seriously. ''It makes perfect sense to have the best leader in sports lead that team. Mark's role almost in life is to help others become better.''</p>
        <p>No one knows that better than Sather, who signed both Messier and Gretzky to their first National Hockey League contracts in Edmonton. When asked if Messier had learned anything from Gretzky over the years, Sather's reply was pointed.</p>
        <p>''I think Gretz learned an awful lot from Mark,'' Sather said.</p>
        <p>Now, Sather and Checketts will be remembered for bringing Messier back to New York. ''When I started talking about the job, Mark was synonymous with it,'' Sather said.</p>
        <p>There are concerns that Messier is past his prime. He had 17 goals and 37 assists in 66 games last season and will be 41 when his contract is through. But Sather said he does not give much credence to age.</p>
        <p>''When Mark started playing in Edmonton, he was 18 years old and everybody said he was too young,'' Sather said. ''Now, I've had a lot of people tell me he's too old. How old was Gordie Howe when he retired? 52. Some people can do it. Some people can't. I've seen guys at 29 who were through.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers are gambling at least $11 million -- a $9 million signing bonus plus a $1 million annual salary and assorted incentives -- that Messier is not.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad these three years are over and that he's back,'' Leetch said.</p>
        <p>As for his exile, Messier said those days are in the past. ''It doesn't matter why things happened, they did happen,'' said Messier, with just the slightest hint of a glare. ''The important thing for me, Mr. Checketts and the Garden is that we're sitting here today trying to turn everything around.''</p>
        <p>This time, his eyes were dry.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>GLEN SATHER, the Rangers' president and general manager, indicated that the chances of signing CLAUDE LEMIEUX, the Devils' free agent, have dimmed.</p>
