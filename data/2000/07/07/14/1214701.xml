        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As you note in a July 11 editorial, the welfare-to-work transition was much more successful than expected as a result of a strong ''economy that cut the unemployment rate in about half.'' Corporations could no longer indulge their misconceived stereotypes and were forced to hire welfare recipients. But what of the dangers inherent in the Federal Reserve policy of eliminating tight labor markets?</p>
        <p>The policy has had a small but adverse effect on young and less educated workers. Further slowdowns in job growth will make it harder for many people to retain employment and for additional welfare recipients to find it. Isn't the ability to get these groups into the mainstream worth the risk of a bit more inflation -- or are the interests of bondholders paramount?</p>
        <p>ROBERT CHERRY  Brooklyn, July 11, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of economics at Brooklyn College, CUNY.</p>
