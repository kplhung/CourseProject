        <p>Bill Bradley emerged from months of political seclusion today to endorse Al Gore, his erstwhile primary foe, and to help the vice president appeal to independent voters here in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley, whose bitter primary battle with Mr. Gore ended without the former New Jersey senator's winning a single state, used the words of Vince Lombardi, the former coach of the Green Bay Packers, to say he would work for a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress. ''Winning is a team sport,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Today I want to make it clear that I endorse Al Gore for president of the United States,'' Mr. Bradley told a crowd at an old-fashioned amusement park on the shore of Lake Michigan. He cited the vice president's leadership and his understanding of technology, saying that that understanding would allow Mr. Gore to keep the nation steady in an era of rapid change.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore effusively praised Mr. Bradley for his ''high ideals,'' adding, ''There is no more passionate voice for justice and equality in all of America.''</p>
        <p>As the two Democrats were making up on the stage, Mr. Gore's campaign was engaged in the kind of political pounding of Gov. George W. Bush's policies that Mr. Gore had used so effectively against Mr. Bradley in the primaries.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign seized on news of a $750 million state budget shortfall in Texas as evidence that Mr. Bush's proposal for a $1.3 trillion tax cut for the United States over 10 years would derail the nation's roaring economy.</p>
        <p>''Governor Bush wants to do for America what he's done for Texas -- go to Washington and spend our surplus and then more for budget-busting tax cuts, and hope then that somehow it will all add up,'' Mr. Gore asserted. ''The last thing this country needs is an era of Bush economics that brings us back to deficits, high interest rates and high unemployment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush responded with a sharp attack on Mr. Gore, contending that the vice president did not understand the budget process in Texas and that his state's budget shortfall would be covered by surplus tax revenue. ''If Al Gore suggests a state with a surplus shouldn't cut taxes, then how can the American people count on Al Gore to cut taxes when our nation has a surplus?'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>But the main task of the day, at least for Mr. Gore, was to present Mr. Bradley as an ally and to win over the independent voters that the former senator appealed to in his own campaign.</p>
        <p>Today's appearance was the first time Mr. Bradley and Mr. Gore had met since debating in Los Angeles on March 1. Mr. Bradley, who last fall surprised the Gore campaign by gaining strong support in New Hampshire and other critical states, was ultimately trounced by Mr. Gore in every state in which they competed. Mr. Bradley dropped out of the race on March 9, retaining his handful of delegates and not issuing an explicit endorsement of Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>But the Gore campaign has had trouble attracting the kind of voters to whom Mr. Bradley appealed, particularly white men and independents. And as the mid-August Democratic convention approaches, officials said, the Gore camp has been ever more eager to knit up the raveled Bradley relationship and aggressively court the swing voters who are up for grabs in the Midwest battleground states.</p>
        <p>''I really appreciated Senator Bradley's support,'' Mr. Gore told supporters at the airport here after the event. ''This is one of the most important days in the election.''</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign chose this quaint set-piece of Americana as the site of the long-awaited reunion for its picturesqueness and the chance to reach out to swing voters.</p>
        <p>The crowd, which local police officials estimated at about 3,500, was bolstered by Gore supporters from organized labor, including the National Education Association and the International Association of Fire Fighters. They have been among the vice president's most ardent supporters, and their presence reflected the Gore campaign's concern, given the intensity that characterized their primary battle with Mr. Bradley, that the event could have gone awry.</p>
        <p>As it happened, the event appeared to go smoothly, even if there was little warmth between the candidates and their staffs. None of the Bradley aides is joining the Gore campaign, and the two candidates did not make themselves available to reporters for questioning after their speeches.</p>
        <p>Democratic officials said Mr. Bradley could not be available because he had to catch a plane tonight to Italy, but there also was some grumbling among Bradley backers that Mr. Gore had held the event in Wisconsin instead of a state like New Jersey or New York, where Mr. Bradley is better known and more popular.</p>
        <p>The two met privately at the airport here for 40 minutes, with no aides present, before they appeared together and clasped hands for the cameras. Gore aides said that Mr. Bradley would have a prime-time speaking slot on the second night of the four-day nominating convention and that they expect Mr. Bradley to campaign on behalf of Mr. Gore, but nothing has been scheduled.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr. Bradley alluded to the ''big'' issues he had raised in the primaries -- racial strife, poverty, globalization -- and said that, under Mr. Gore's leadership, ''We will come closer to solving the problems I mentioned earlier than under the leadership of Gov. George W. Bush -- and it's not even a close call.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley also said he was endorsing Mr. Gore because the vice president understood technology.</p>
        <p>''Vice President Gore has a deep understanding of those technological forces changing America,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''I know he will strive to keep America ahead of those forces so that they maximize our future for the greatest number of Americans.''</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Bradley was quite ready to step out today seemed arguable. Famously contemplative and reluctant to follow the traditional norms of politics, he acknowledged somewhat wistfully in his speech that his loss to Mr. Gore had been a deep disappointment, one that he was chalking up to experience.</p>
        <p>'' 'Experience' then is what you get when you don't get what you really wanted,'' Mr. Bradley said.</p>
        <p>A Bradley aide said that when friends ask Mr. Bradley how he is doing, he recalls the advice that Thomas Dewey, who lost the presidency to Harry S. Truman in 1948, is said to have given Richard M. Nixon after Mr. Nixon lost the 1960 presidential race. ''Bradley says, 'Dewey told Nixon, don't make any important decisions within six months of losing the presidency,' '' the aide said, adding, ''Bradley says he's in his fifth month.''</p>
        <p>In addition to their full-scale effort to present the Bradley endorsement in the best possible light, the Gore team went to great lengths today to focus reporters' attention on the Texas budget, delivering reams of documents and flying a policy aide from Washington and a state legislator from Texas to Green Bay to brief reporters on it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said that his own proposals for balancing the budget and paying down the debt would maintain the current economic boom. He added: ''Governor Bush has a different priority -- massive tax breaks for those who don't need them. Let's give Governor Bush credit -- he practices what he preaches, in that his top priority for Texas's budget surpluses was a big tax cut.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference in Pittsburgh, Mr. Bush responded to the criticism by saying that President Clinton was planning to sign a $15 billion supplemental appropriation for extra expenses in the current fiscal year.</p>
        <p>''That's why Vice President Al Gore has got no credibility on an issue like this,'' Mr. Bush said. ''On one hand he wants to launch an attack. On the other hand President Clinton is doing the same thing.''</p>
        <p>Asked later why Mr. Bush had made such a point of aggressively rebutting Mr. Gore, Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the governor, pointed to the man who lost so badly to Mr. Gore in the primaries. ''Bush is not Bradley,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''Bush will counterpunch.''</p>
        <p>In His Own Words</p>
        <p>BILL BRADLEY  Endorsing Vice President Al Gore yesterday in Green Bay, Wis.:</p>
        <p>''The Democratic Party is a place of many different voices but all with the same values. It's why we're Democrats. Democrats know that ultimately, government sometimes must do big things that individuals cannot do, the nonprofit sector doesn't have the resources to do and the private sector will not do. Helping people help themselves through government support is a healthy prescription for creating a stronger society.</p>
        <p>Throughout my campaign I talked about the enormous opportunity we had to do big things, again. An enormous opportunity made possible by the economic growth we've had for the last decade and by the Democratic leadership of Bill Clinton, Al Gore and the Democratic Congressional candidates who helped make it possible. . . .</p>
        <p>Our problems are well known. Forty-four million people without health coverage; 13 million children living in poverty; continued racial discord; a public education system that needs universal quality; working families still struggling against the forces of technological change, and globalization and a political process dangerously awash in money.</p>
        <p>At this time of unparalleled prosperity there is no excuse for not acting now.</p>
        <p>For 15 months I ran for president of the United States. I am honored and grateful to those people across America who supported me. I had a remarkable experience. Someone once told me that when one uses the term experience in this context, experience then is what you get when you don't get what you really wanted.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Democratic voters spoke and selected Vice President Gore as our party's nominee. I'm here in Green Bay today because I believe what Vince Lombardi once said is true: Winning is a team sport.</p>
        <p>Our party is strongest when we're unified, when we speak with one voice, when we work to guarantee a Democratic Congress and a Democratic president. I will work to accomplish both because I believe that Democrats have a better chance of guiding America to a brighter future than do Republicans, and it's not even close.</p>
        <p>And today, I want to make it clear that I endorse Al Gore for president of the United States.</p>
        <p>I believe that under his leadership we will come closer to solving the problems I mentioned earlier than under the leadership of George W. Bush, and it's not even close.''</p>
