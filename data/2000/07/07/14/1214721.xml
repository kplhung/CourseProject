        <p>Editorial scores Philadelphia police officers who punched, kicked and stomped on a man after he had already been shot five times; notes that since the man, Thomas Jones, who was allegedly resisting arrest, and several of the officers involved are black, there are fewer racial overtones in the case than in assault on Rodney King in Los Angeles</p>

        <p>The sickening sight of Philadelphia police officers caught on videotape punching, kicking and stomping on a man who had already been shot five times brings to mind the vicious beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers in 1991. Philadelphia's police commissioner, John Timoney, says such comparisons are unfair. There are clear differences in the two cases. But they both show officers out of control and using excessive force to settle a score with a suspect.</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia man, Thomas Jones, allegedly resisted arrest, fired on the police, stole a patrol car and led police on a chase before he was pulled out of the cruiser. The officers obviously were enraged by such resistance and by the shootout, which left one officer wounded in the hand. But that does not excuse the ferocious beating that took place after Mr. Jones was wounded, surrounded and lying on the ground. The tape showed a mob attack rather than an orderly arrest.</p>

        <p>The sickening sight of Philadelphia police officers caught on videotape punching, kicking and stomping on a man who had already been shot five times brings to mind the vicious beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers in 1991. Philadelphia's police commissioner, John Timoney, says such comparisons are unfair. There are clear differences in the two cases. But they both show officers out of control and using excessive force to settle a score with a suspect.</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia man, Thomas Jones, allegedly resisted arrest, fired on the police, stole a patrol car and led police on a chase before he was pulled out of the cruiser. The officers obviously were enraged by such resistance and by the shootout, which left one officer wounded in the hand. But that does not excuse the ferocious beating that took place after Mr. Jones was wounded, surrounded and lying on the ground. The tape showed a mob attack rather than an orderly arrest.</p>
        <p>Since several of the officers involved are black, as is Mr. Jones, there are fewer racial overtones in this case than in the assault on Rodney King, in which all four of the officers in the beating were white. That difference, however, offers no comfort to civil rights groups that have been working for years to end notorious patterns of abuse in the Philadelphia Police Department. There have been positive strides in police-community relations in recent years. But the fact that the officers showed no restraint suggests that the police culture has not changed enough in Philadelphia, which will soon play host to the Republican National Convention.</p>
        <p>Mayor John Street and Commissioner Timoney have said they will conduct vigorous investigations into the officers' actions. The Justice Department announced yesterday that it would begin a civil rights inquiry to determine whether excessive force had been used. The videotape records a scene that will be hard to justify.</p>
