        <p>Here's the defining problem with ''Nuremberg,'' TNT's ambitious, well-meaning two-part mini-series about the trial of Nazi war criminals: the ''best'' character in the movie is Hermann Goring.</p>
        <p>Through Brian Cox's complex performance, Goring (founder of the Gestapo, Hitler's No. 2) becomes his finest self. He is urbane, loyal and courageous -- and he gets the best lines.

        <p>Here's the defining problem with ''Nuremberg,'' TNT's ambitious, well-meaning two-part mini-series about the trial of Nazi war criminals: the ''best'' character in the movie is Hermann Goring.</p>
        <p>Through Brian Cox's complex performance, Goring (founder of the Gestapo, Hitler's No. 2) becomes his finest self. He is urbane, loyal and courageous -- and he gets the best lines. ''The victors will always be the judges, the vanquished always the accused,'' he says with world-weary knowingness.</p>
        <p>Unlike many of his fellow defendants, he refuses to cower or apologize to curry favor with his accusers. He even sounds reasonable as he explains German anti-Semitism to the Jewish therapist sent by the Allied lawyers to gather information. When his wife and young daughter are kept from visiting him in prison, it seems downright unfair.</p>
        <p>Certainly the filmmakers haven't whitewashed Nazi war crimes. Like the 1961 film, ''Judgment at Nuremberg,'' this docudrama turns testimony of deprivation and unimaginable cruelty into riveting courtroom drama and plays its emotional trump card with film from the Nazi camps. So while the production's Goring may seem like an engaging fellow, he was clearly a reigning spirit in an enterprise of unsurpassing evil.</p>
        <p>The humanizing of history -- especially in dealing with difficult subjects like, say, genocide -- is a tricky business, especially in the context of a television miniseries. The dialogue is crammed with explanations: ''Our task is to make sure this is not the trial of superior might but the trial of superior morality,'' says Robert Jackson (Alec Baldwin), the United States Supreme Court justice who was the chief prosecutor at Nuremberg.</p>
        <p>But even trials of superior morality can become tedious, so the filmmakers decided to spice the proceedings with Justice Jackson's budding extramarital romance with his assistant, Elsie Douglas (Jill Hennessy). Two questions compete for our attention during the first two-thirds of Part 1: Will the Nazis be given a fair trial? Will Elsie and Bob kiss?</p>
        <p>Mr. Baldwin, sober and appropriately more portly than sexy, delivers Jackson's lofty courtroom speeches with quiet dignity. There isn't much, however, that he can do to deflate the pompousness of his character's private musings. When Elsie admires his eloquence, he agrees with her: ''I've tried to capture a tone, a mood for the entire case, a melancholy grandeur if you will.''</p>
        <p>Poor Ms. Hennessy has the thankless task of casting moony glances at her boss-lover -- and the equally thankless task of elucidation through stating the obvious. When she and Justice Jackson -- she calls him Bob -- first confront the sad rubble of Nuremberg the city, she says, ''When my brother came here as a college student -- I still have a picture book he bought me -- it was nothing like this. This isn't even the same city. There were medieval bridges and gingerbread houses.''</p>
        <p>Bob explains further, like a tour guide, ''Nuremberg was also the spiritual center of the Third Reich.''</p>
        <p>The filmmakers have set themselves an enormous task, trying to sort out the moral and behavioral conundrums that gave rise to the Third Reich. They've assigned the job of illuminating the biggest questions -- of German compliance and the very nature of evil -- to Capt. Gustav Gilbert (Matt Craven), the American psychotherapist.</p>
        <p>Goring, amused to find out that his shrink is a Jew, says to him, ''This is a very interesting situation for both of us.'' The obedient Albert Speer (Herbert Knaup) explains to the doctor that Germans like to follow orders.</p>
        <p>Later, to Justice Jackson, Dr. Gilbert confides his conclusions. ''I think I've come close to defining it,'' he declares. ''Evil, I think, is the absence of empathy.'' Well, maybe, but aren't there many cold, unfeeling unempathic people who don't commit torture and murder on a massive scale?</p>
        <p>Through its educational division, Turner Broadcasting will distribute study guides to schools along with the film to help students ''analyze the trials from multiple perspectives, explore how history is interpreted in film and study themes of individual responsibility and the nature of evil.'' That sounds promising.</p>
        <p>But the film itself reminded me of the conclusions of the novelist and journalist Rebecca West, in her brilliant firsthand reports on the Nuremberg trials. ''We were going to hang 11 of these 18 men, and imprison the other 7 for 10, 15, 20 years or for life; but we had no idea why they had done what they did,'' she wrote (never mentioning their empathy, or lack thereof).</p>
        <p>She continued: ''We had learned what they did, beyond all doubt, and that is the great achievement of the Nuremberg trial. No literate person can now pretend that these men were anything but abscesses of cruelty. But we learned nothing about them that we did not know before, except that they were capable of heroism to which they had no moral right, and that there is nothing in the legend that a bully is always a coward.''</p>
