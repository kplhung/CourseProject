        <p>HIGH oil prices have set off a 70's revival among politicians. Senator Charles E. Schumer is calling for a national commission to avert a new energy crisis. Hillary Rodham Clinton wants to crack down on price-gouging oil companies; she and her opponent for the Senate, Rick A. Lazio, both advocate a heating oil reserve for the Northeast.</p>
        <p>To economists, these proposals are weirdly retrograde versions of policies that failed miserably in the 1970's. But politicians know that the policies have an enduring public appeal, especially here. The energy crisis was created by following economic principles that still rule New York City. It was a brief version of our perpetual housing crisis.</p>
        <p>Starting in 1971, President Nixon and Congress tried to protect energy consumers the way that New York politicians protect tenants. High prices were outlawed. The price controls on petroleum prevented refiners from passing along the rising cost of imported oil, with predictable results. They imported less oil.</p>
        <p>As supplies tightened, the major oil companies kept supplying their own brand-name service stations but reduced shipments to independent stations. The independent dealers howled, and politicians demanded investigations and more controls. The oil companies became everyone's favorite villain, the national equivalent of New York's landlords.</p>
        <p>Clearly only politicians could be trusted to provide energy. Congress established what Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton are now proposing for heating oil: a politically controlled reserve. In September 1973, Congress set aside 5 percent of gasoline supplies to be allocated by the governor of each state.</p>
        <p>The next month brought the Yom Kippur War, soaring oil prices and an oil embargo against America. The embargo need not have produced shortages: as long as the Arabs kept selling their oil to others, there was enough on the world market for America to buy indirectly. The oil just cost more.</p>
        <p>But the higher price further discouraged American importers unable to pass along the increase, so inventories kept shrinking. Then the gas line panic was set off by the very 5 percent reserve program enacted to prevent it, as the economist Peter Van Doren concluded in his book analyzing the energy crisis, ''Politics, Markets, and Congressional Policy Choices'' (University of Michigan Press, 1991).</p>
        <p>''Every gas station in America suddenly could count on only 95 percent of its monthly allotment,'' said Dr. Van Doren, the editor of Regulation, an economic journal published by the Cato Institute. ''Some would run low at the end of the month, and they never knew when or if the governor would release his 5 percent share. So they began informally rationing supplies by reducing their hours or saving gasoline for their best customers.''</p>
        <p>SOON drivers, who keep their tanks half full on average, were showing up daily to top their tanks, which led to more shortages, panic and lines around the block. Dr. Van Doren said that a similar chain reaction could take place this year if Congress disrupts the market by establishing a heating oil reserve.</p>
        <p>''Energy markets are volatile,'' Dr. Van Doren said. ''With heating oil inventories already down, if the government starts diverting oil into a reserve, the price will rise as dealers compete for what's left. The fear of price increases could lead more homeowners to fill up their tanks in August, which would stimulate still higher prices, which could lead to more newspaper stories, which could cause panic and set off a run on heating oil.''</p>
        <p>The shortages of the 1970's inspired predictions of $100-a-barrel-oil and grandly expensive programs to develop alternative sources of energy. But what ended the energy crisis was the deregulation of petroleum prices in the late 1970's and 1980's.</p>
        <p>Once the hated oil companies were allowed to set their own prices, they surprised their critics by providing so much cheap oil and natural gas that alternative sources of energy could not compete. There was no shortage even during another Middle East war in 1991. Prices have spiked at times, like this year, but the inflation-adjusted price of gasoline today is still a third lower than it was two decades ago.</p>
        <p>''I guess politicians have forgotten their lesson from the energy crisis,'' Dr. Van Doren said. ''It was the most massively messed up political intervention in any market that I'm aware of, except maybe for New York City's rent control program. It was such a mess that politicians stopped intervening for a while. But now they seem to be back, and I don't think consumers will be well served.''</p>
