        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* JEAN-SIMEON CHARDIN, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 3). This retrospective doesn't tell us much that wasn't already known about Chardin, but there's nothing wrong with being reminded occasionally of what great painting is. The art, by contrast with so much Rococo art, is about love, not sex. Quiet and deliberation were Chardin's essential ingredients, combined with a perfect mastery of abstract form. He was the best still-life painter ever because he made the most of the least, his work focusing on the same humble cups and pans in one painting after another, one decade after another. The result was a compilation of precise little observations that together make as true a record of the value of seeing as exists in the history of art. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).</p>

        <p>* JEAN-SIMEON CHARDIN, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 3). This retrospective doesn't tell us much that wasn't already known about Chardin, but there's nothing wrong with being reminded occasionally of what great painting is.

        <p>* WILLIAM MERRITT CHASE, ''Modern American Landscapes, 1886-1890,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Aug. 13). Chase (1849-1916) had a long, distinguished run as a painter, teacher and art politician. But this show zeroes in on the five-year period when, in a transitional phase between the brown, murky tones of his Munich training and his arrival at a lighter style based on French Impressionism, he painted genteel views of park landscapes in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Aside from their engaging scenic content, the 35 oils and pastels in the show are important because they are the first paintings in which an Impressionist style was used to depict American subjects. Recent examination corrected some errors about their locales. And new scholarly speculation on Chase's motives for painting them suggest that he wanted them to serve as examples of ''civilized urban landscapes'' that accorded with the European avant-garde model of modern life. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''MAKING CHOICES, 1920-1960,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Sept. 26). The main event at the Modern these days is the museum itself. This has been the case since last fall, when the project ''MOMA 2000'' began the first of what will be three successive top-to-bottom reinstallations of the permanent collection galleries. The affair has been billed as a test drive for the future, a chance for an institution to rethink the modern art tradition that it helped invent and to consider its own identity in what is often called a postmodern world. This second installment, which looks denser, weirder, messier and more truly modern (or maybe postmodern) than the first, is a big leap in the right direction. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>ALICE NEEL, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Sept. 17). The pleasures of this rewarding exhibition are dampened by the feeling that Neel's long, fruitful career could have sustained a larger effort, one that parses her evolution chapter and verse, on paper and canvas, instead of concentrating on the well-known portraits of her last 25 years. These portraits, which usually feature family members or denizens of the art world, are frequently great and always marvelously loquacious. Color, shape and brushwork, along with Neel's signature distortions of body and face, all have their say, and both the painterly process and the human psyche are repeatedly laid bare. Neel, never less than interesting and always striving, operated in the gap between the Stieglitz circle and the Abstract Expressionists with a fruitfulness matched only by Stuart Davis; like his late work, hers is an indelible part of the postwar period. It's time for a full-dress or, in Whitney terms, a two-floor treatment. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50, students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''MAXFIELD PARRISH, 1870-1966,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Aug. 6). A romantic fabulist who painted in a tight, finicky mode that left out no detail, Parrish (1870-1966) was a highly accomplished illustrator who could be considered the father of Norman Rockwell. As a more aspiring painter, he also pursued a never-never world of chaste but titillating young women and knightly men in pastoral landscapes that melded medieval towers with New England forests, Western gorges and the deep blue skies of fairy kingdoms. This show of more than 140 paintings, drawings, prints, illustrations and ephemera ranges from such well-known Parrish chestnuts as ''Daybreak'' (1922), depicting a young woman's ecstatic awakening to an erotically symbolic dawn, to his coy, cartoonish ''Old King Cole'' mural of 1894. Aside from its campy entertainment value, there is enough here -- particularly his graphic art and some fine landscapes -- to sustain the revival of interest in his work that began with the Pop Art era. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''SYNAPSIS SHUFFLE,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Oct. 8). Robert Rauschenberg's latest divertissement -- if one may use that word for such a dull performance -- is a group of 52 panels, the number alluding to a full deck of cards, each bearing a mix of photographic images taken by the artist and transferred to the panels' polylaminate surfaces. The images include objects, street scenes, people and natural phenomena, along with snippets from advertising, magazines and newspapers. Involved with the notion of audience participation in his art for many years, Mr. Rauschenberg invited 12 fellow celebrities to ''compose'' their own work, creating ''new'' ones by selecting from several of the panels and placing them in whatever juxtaposition came to mind. The celebrities, among them the television journalist Mike Wallace, the soprano Renee Fleming, the choreographer Merce Cunningham and the talent agent and art collector Michael Ovitz, obliged. But aside from the fact that it's a little hard to buy the premise that anyone can create a new work simply by pushing around the artist's components, they had cliche material to work with. Over the years Mr. Rauschenberg has been an enormous influence in the art world, making pioneering use of the transfer technique, among other contributions. But in the last decade and a half his use of these images has become platitudinous. The pretentiousness of ''Synapsis Shuffle,'' the celebrity-kissing self-promotion it has involved, and the wasteful allotment of nearly 6,000 square feet of gallery to it at the space-challenged Whitney are not cause for celebration (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''WITHOUT SANCTUARY: LYNCHING PHOTOGRAPHY IN AMERICA,'' New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through Aug. 13). This exhibition scrutinizes a painful chapter in American history with heart-rending clarity: small black-and-white photographs of lynchings that took place between 1880 and 1960: mostly in the South, nearly always with African-American victims. Even more disturbing than the sight of the limp, often tortured and mutilated bodies is the sight of the crowds of white people milling about, sometimes smiling into the camera as if they were at a church picnic or state fair. The extent to which the events were condoned or at least tolerated by society is indicated by accompanying material. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 students and seniors; free for children under 13 (Smith).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>''THE COLLECTOR AS PATRON IN THE 20TH CENTURY,'' Knoedler &amp; Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through July 31). This two-tiered exhibition honors American collectors present and past. Upstairs an exemplary selection from five private collections summarizes postwar American art. Downstairs a fascinating archival display of correspondence, photographs and color reproductions profiles 28 important American collections, tracing their impact on American museums and offering tantalizing glimpses of their dealings with Knoedler, the oldest art gallery in New York (Smith).</p>
        <p>''ULRIKE OTTINGER: TAIGA.'' Goethe Institute of New York, 1014 Fifth Avenue, near 82nd Street, (212) 439-8700 (through July 21). This small but moving exhibition of photographs by Ulrike Ottinger, a German underground filmmaker, writer and photographer, captures the disappearing world and nomadic life of the Shaman and Tuvan people of the Taiga region of Northern Mongolia (Smith).</p>
        <p>JOAQUIN TORRES-GARCIA, CDS, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555 (through July 29). This pioneering, peripatetic Uruguayan Modernist is represented in a modest exhibition of small works on paper and several easel-size oil paintings. The show includes early, brusquely painted city and harbor scenes but is devoted mainly to the artist's distinctive combination of grid-based abstraction and cosmic, pictographic symbolism (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>ROBERT ARNESON, ''Me, Myself and I,'' Franklin Parrasch Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360 (through July 21). One of the zaniest of gifted self-portrayers, the ceramist Robert Arneson (1930-1992) modeled his own head in a multiplicity of guises. A dozen versions appear in this first commercial gallery survey of Arneson likenesses. The concentration is on work done in the 1970's and 80's, from a very pink and benign Santa Claus to a scary, scowling mask in black and white that suggests a searcher scratching at his own dark soul. This show barely hints at the many personas Arneson conjured up, but it does give the sense of a maverick talent in total command of his medium who in his cartoony explorations hit not only on himself but also on everyman (Glueck).</p>
        <p>GASTON CHAISSAC, Jan Krugier, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-7288 (through July 25) The earliest works in this career survey of the self-taught Frenchman Chaissac (1910-63) are small pen-and-ink drawings from the late 1930's that have the strange, fantastical intimacy of real outsider art. Though buoyant and tightly composed, paintings from the 1950's and 60's -- puzzlelike conglomerations of boldly outlined shapes with cartoon faces added -- look more like the product of professional routine than unique inner vision (Johnson).</p>
        <p>DONALD SULTAN, Mary Ryan, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 397-0669 (through July 28). In this show of works on paper, Mr. Sultan continues to give rich painterly body to images of apples, eggs and flowers. The main attractions are a six-foot square woodcut of giant green apples overlaid by flat, black egg silhouettes and a dark brown, digitally generated silk-screen image of glowing smoke rings (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>''HERBERT BAYER: CENTENNIAL,'' Kent, 67 Prince Street, (212) 966-4500 (through July 21). This small survey celebrates the 100th anniversary of the birth of Bayer, first a student and then a director at the Bauhaus. (He died in 1985.) Bayer worked in many different styles and mediums, from straight photography to Surrealistic montage to cosmic abstract painting. Always wielding a neat, precise touch, he also did graphic and architectural design and advertising. His work is almost always interesting but tends to be more cleverly derivative than deeply original (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''FUNDAMENTAL OCCURRENCES,'' Malca, 580 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-8854 (through July 29). Seven abstract painters deal personally with the basics of surface, pattern and color. The show includes Robin Bruch's allover crystalline webs, Eve Sonneman's allover fields of little circles atop bigger circles, Glenn Goldberg's abstracted blossoms, Harold Porcher's colored stripe permutations, Chris Martin's big and small cosmic boxes on a huge blue canvas, Joe Fyfe's brushy tumbling boxes and Charles Cooper's subtle, gameboardlike watercolors (Johnson).</p>
        <p>RAOUL HAGUE, Lennon Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-0012 (through July 28). The five monumental sculptures here, each cut from a single piece of walnut, are like Abstract Expressionist paintings turned to living wood; they strongly imply human figures. Carving aggressively but in sympathy with the undulant form and serpentine grain of the log, Hague (1904-1993) created these powerful weddings of art and nature between 1969 and 1978. Here they ride on the wheeled dollies he favored for storage, giving the massive forms a curious lightness and mobility (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''INSIDE OUT: REALITY OR FICTION?,'' Sean Kelly, 43 Mercer Street, (212) 343-2405 (through July 21). This unusually satisfying, three-pronged approach to the photography of constructed realities includes James Casebere's gloomy pictures of strategically lighted architectural models; photographs of sets for television shows or commercials by Miriam Backstrom; and pictures of real library interiors by Candida Hofer that seem, in this context, strangely artificial (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CHRISTOPHER KENDI; ALEXANDROS GEORGIOU; ROLAND FLEXNER, Curt Marcus, 578 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 226-3200 (through July 21). In an amusing series of color photographs presented in cheerful, primary-colored frames, the young Mr. Kendi appears in everyday moments from his own life: shaving, putting on red socks, eating at McDonalds; he has a deadpan, Buster Keatonesque charm. In his photographs, Mr. Georgiou turns still lifes into landscapes by adding small cutout photographs of himself. Mr. Flexner offers fascinating, finely detailed, two-inch circles that result from the meeting of paper and inky soap bubbles (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MARK MANDERS, The Drawing Room, 40 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166 (through July 26). Judging by a mysterious miniature night scene with little cups, draped twine and dried blackened earth inside a vitrine (it calls to mind Giacometti's ''Palace at 4 A.M.''), this young Dutch artist is an interesting sculptor. But his scrawled, surrealistic drawings, all pertaining to an elaborate project called ''Self-Portrait as a Building,'' are too sketchy and elliptical to be as exciting for the viewer as they appear to be for their creator (Johnson)</p>
        <p>LOUIS MONZA, Luise Ross, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-2161 (through next Friday). The self-taught Monza, who was born in Italy in 1897 and died in California in 1984, was known for his bold and passionate social-protest paintings. Late in life, however, his art became otherworldly. His preoccupation with issues like environmental pollution and nuclear disaster persists, but in many of the small drawings from the 60's, 70's and 80's here, the serpentine line, radiant light and densely improvised, mythic imagery bespeak a rather psychedelic turn of mind (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>''BOUNDLESSLY VARIOUS AND EVERYTHING SIMULTANEOUSLY,'' Bose Pacia Modern, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 989-7074 (through July 20). In the 1980's the American artist Peter Nagy ran an ahead-of-the-curve gallery called Nature Morte in Manhattan. Three years ago he reopened it in New Delhi, where he lives, and this summer he has brought several of his artists -- Indian, American and European -- to New York in a visually buoyant, idea-rich group show. Jeffrey Schiff offers cosmic soap; Nicola Durvasala turns the Kama Sutra into a disembodied dream; Anita Dube explores connections between Tantra and de Sade; Vivan Sundaram brings 800 photographs of a Delhi flea market to the great and voracious bazaar known as the New York art world (Cotter).</p>
        <p>DEBORAH BUTTERFIELD, Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 691-6565 (through July 28). Ms. Butterfield continues to do what she does so well: making remarkably lifelike images of horses out of found scraps of wood. It is disappointing, however, to discover that the two life-size and four half-size sculptures in this show are actually craftily patinated bronzes cast from original wooden constructions. The bronze adds substance and material luxury but undoes the tension between raw material and animated illusion (Johnson).</p>
        <p>GUNTHER FORG, Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100) (through July 28) and Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, (212) 462-2668 (through today). Mr. Forg, an internationally known German, makes obliquely grandiose art in various mediums. At Christine Burgin blurry, nondescript photographs of aging modern buildings in the Czech city Zlijn meditate, one guesses, on the demise of Modernism's utopian ideals. At Lurhing Augustine, bloated, carelessly made generic abstract paintings might also comment, a la Peter Halley, on the passing of heroic modernism (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''GAME ON!,'' Sara Meltzer, 516 West 20th Street, (212) 727-9330 (through July 28). Fourteen artists have fun with sports in this smart and playful show. The two members of Type A wrestle on video; Sylvan Lionni's simulation of a Ping-Pong table and Michael Scott's baseball field on canvas both elegantly parody 1960's-style formalism; Jason Dodge offers a drop-dead sleek conflation of sports and commodity fetishism; and Christopher Chiappa presents a concrete crash helmet (Johnson)</p>
        <p>''INNUENDO,'' Dee/Glasoe, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 924-7545 (through July 22). True to its title, ''Innuendo,'' one of the better group shows of the moment, generates a compelling ambience of understated eroticism. Works by 13 artists include a massive Gothic Revival bed by Brian Tolle, a yearbook-style portrait of a winsomely vacant girl by John Currin; intertwined female legs in a snappy, Pop-style gouache by John Wesley; Dana Hoey's clever, photographic update of the Judgment of Paris; and a mesmerizing video by Shannon Kennedy (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ROBERTO JUAREZ: PAINTINGS, Robert Miller Gallery, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774 (through July). Gone are the lush blooms and biotica that used to flourish in Roberto Juarez's richly wrought paintings. His current works are New York-based abstractions that play on the garish mix of buildings in the new Times Square, along with elements from his recent paintings of Rome, now pared down to linear essences. True, the mosaics of loops, mazes, convoluted whorls and calligraphic writhings that characterize some paintings don't always make direct allusions. The biggest canvas, ''Times Square Tiles,'' suggests a huge, relaxed coil of beadwork, made up of tiny black and white modules. It evokes strands of genetic material swimming in a primal soup more than it does Times Square. The liquescent effect comes from the pale grounds of pink, green and other less distinguishable tonalities skillfully laid down by Mr. Juarez. These are strong paintings, a nice change of pace for this artist (Glueck).</p>
        <p>ANDREJ MONASTYRSKIJ; DONA NELSON; VARGAS-SUAREZ UNIVERSAL; TOM WOOD, Thomas Erben Gallery, 516 West 20th Street, (212) 645-8701 (through July 28). The main attraction in this interesting but completely disconnected group show is an environment with sound, a white rug, beanbag chairs and rich ballpoint-pen abstractions by Mr. Universal. Also, a crude interactive work by Mr. Monastyrskij, a Russian conceptualist, promises a surprise; Mr. Wood, an English photographer, shows subtle, social realist character studies; and Ms. Nelson presents two aggressively material yet rather decorous abstract paintings (Johnson)</p>
        <p>''A SELECTIVE SURVEY OF POLITICAL ART,'' John Weber, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 691-5711 (through July 22). Including works from the last four decades, this 16-artist show is more dryly academic than urgently political. The freshest work is an elaborate, precisely drawn conspiracy diagram by Mark Lombardi; the most sensuous is an embroidered world map by Alighiero E. Boetti. There are works from the early 80's by Jenny Holzer and Barbara Kruger and hand-lettered antiwar texts on postcards made in the 1960's by Ad Reinhardt (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''THE THRILL OF IT ALL,'' Ten in One, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 604-9660, (through July 29). Six young artists scheduled for solo shows next year are previewed in this appealing exhibition. Works include Pam Lins's foam cooler in a pile of fake snow; Walter Andersons's remarkable painted copies of art book photocopies; Carlos Mollura's inflated black Neo-Minimalist sculpture; Carol Jackson's Neo-Pop leatherwork; Stephanie Brooks's funny score-keeping LED sign (''sentiment 16; contempt 2''); and John Spear's wildly funky collage on an old blanket (Johnson).</p>
        <p>SIMON UNGERS, Henry Urbach Architecture, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-0974 (through July 21). An architect and artist of inventive and rigorous intelligence presents four models made of rusty, cold-rolled steel that combine powerful sculptural condensation, exacting miniaturistic delicacy and visionary architectural imagination. In these designs for a cathedral, a library, a museum and a theater, conceptions of intricate complexity are clothed in an austere, near-Minimal yet subtly complex vocabulary. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>''WEEGEE: DISTORTIONS,'' Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 23rd Street, (212) 243-0200 (through July 28). This fantastic show presents the little-seen, underappreciated late work of Arthur Fellig (1899-1968), or Weegee, whose gritty, implicitly Expressionistic camera work both invented and surpassed tabloid photojournalism in the 1930's and 40's. The early 50's found Weegee in Hollywood, inventing mostly in his darkroom and bringing the Expressionistic, often malicious edge of his art into the open. He subjected photographs, both old and new, to a range of abuses: melting negatives, doubling exposures and adding curved or variously textured glass to the enlarger. What he found was, in effect, a ready-made form of caricature. The victims of his distortions include movie starlets and politicians, artists and artworks, whose images are bent and twisted, multiplied and divided to optically amusing, psychologically penetrating and sometimes frightening effect. The images are historically polymorphous as well, belonging equally to the history of Surrealism, political caricature, animation and photo appropriation (Smith).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>JOHN AHEARN: ''SCULPTURE FROM EAST 100TH STREET, PART 2,'' Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, at 18th Street, (212) 367-7474 (through July 28). Mr. Ahearn's cast of plaster characters, impressions of his neighborhood friends taken from life, has changed slightly since his 1995 move from the South Bronx to the barrio of East 100th Street. Mostly wall sculptures in half-length or head-and-shoulder presentations, these painted likenesses range from whimsical self-portraits to frolicking teenagers at a New Year's Eve party. The revelers include ''Chris and Starr,'' a couple wearing New Year's Eve hats, linked by Chris's arm as he toots on a toy trumpet; ''KP,'' a boy and girl locked in a kiss, and ''Terrell With Top Pop,'' a well-fed boy who swigs from a soda bottle. Mr. Ahearn, who is very good at conveying in paint the subtle range of flesh tones, portrays himself twice: as a hand-wringing clown with red nose and turned-down mouth, and more introspectively with a pensive face turned toward the wall. New in this work are several unpainted plaster casts of many hands joined together, cast from subjects seated around a table. Suggesting the sculptural reliefs on medieval cathedrals, they add a spiritual dimension to this very human show (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''THE ART OF PUBLISHERS' BOOKBINDINGS: 1815-1915,'' Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212) 838-6690 (through July 29). This sumptuous display of more than 250 books offers a fascinating window onto the history of book production and cover design. Many volumes are more interesting for historical than aesthetic reasons, but the show is studded with visual gems, like a haunting gilded design centered on the image of scissors and a lock of hair by Aubrey Beardsley for Alexander Pope's ''Rape of the Lock'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>FELISA GRADOWCZYK, Clinica Aesthetica, 427 West 14th Street, (212) 243-5345 (through July 29). For Ms. Gradowczyk, a sculptor who lives in Argentina and also practices and teaches psychotherapy, wire-mesh screening -- rolled, knotted, spiraled and punctuated by nails or staples -- serves as a metaphor about the blockage of psychic energy. Her mostly coffee-table-scale works hover somewhere between Post-Minimalist abstraction and kitschy decoration (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>FREDERIC EDWIN CHURCH, ''In Search of the Promised Land,'' Berry-Hill, 11 East 70th Street, (212) 744-2300 (through tomorrow). This sumptuous exhibition of 50 works, the largest in New York in nearly 30 years, spans most of Church's long career, offering opportunities to contrast his innate early talent with its maturation, his reverence for the American landscape with his depiction of exotic sites, and his grand, sometimes grandiose finished statements with his small animated studies (Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''EDWARD HOPPER, PRINTMAKER,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Sunday). Before concentrating on paintings, Hopper (1882-1967) made prints from 1913 to 1923. In that decade he produced his first mature work, a wonderful body of etchings that brought realism, emotion and a strong sense of the medium's potential to a field that had become more decorative than challenging. Using many of the motifs he was to pursue in his later paintings -- nudes, loners, decrepit houses, night scenes, railroad trains -- Hopper took full advantage of the intense moodiness a black-and-white etching can convey. The pervasive theme of loneliness and isolation for which he was noted is very much present in this show. The nearly 50 works here are a fine introduction to Hopper's basic themes and give a splendid idea of what he accomplished in the demanding medium. Hours: Today through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50, students and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''TRANSPARENT ARCHITECTURE,'' Gale Gates, 37 Main Street, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 522-4596 (through tomorrow). Organized by Anne Ellegood, this show smartly kicks off the gallery's ''Emerging Curators Series'' with art that plays in interesting ways with images of architecture and surveillance. Interiors are shot surreptitiously through windows or filmed with hidden cameras. Exteriors are captured in aerial views. Residential secrets are made public through advertising. There are no safe houses here, and the cool, eerie sleekness of the largely photographic work suits the theme. The artists, including Merry Alpern, David Deutsch, Jonah Freeman, Ashley Hunt, George Kimmerling and Warren Neidich, make a strong team (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''WOMEN OF THE WORLD: A GLOBAL COLLECTION OF ART,'' White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, at Horatio Street, West Village, (212) 924-4212 (through tomorrow). The artist Claudia DeMonte organized this show of many small works around a single sweeping idea: asking one woman from every country in the world to contribute a single piece of art addressing ''the experience of being a woman.'' In the end not every country came through, but more than 170 works are on view. The results are uneven, but this a show is less about the strengths or weaknesses of its individual parts than about the embracing humanistic impulse that brought them together (Cotter).</p>
