        <p>Shot in mostly hand-held video and featuring a character whose mental balance is questionable, to say the least, ''Chuck and Buck'' might be described as a Dogma 95 version of ''Disney's 'The Kid.' '' The two films share some underlying themes -- the pain of growing up, the persistence of primal fears and desires into adulthood, the desperate human need for love -- but their methods of exploring them could hardly be more different.</p>
        <p>The difference, ultimately, is between easy sentiment and difficult emotion. Though ''Chuck and Buck,'' Miguel Arteta's new film, is frequently funny and always sincere, there is nothing cute or heartwarming about its view of childhood. It's an intimate, slightly creepy, often disturbing look at loneliness and need -- something, in other words, for the child in all of us.</p>

        <p>Shot in mostly hand-held video and featuring a character whose mental balance is questionable, to say the least, ''Chuck and Buck'' might be described as a Dogma 95 version of ''Disney's 'The Kid.' '' The two films share some underlying themes -- the pain of growing up, the persistence of primal fears and desires into adulthood, the desperate human need for love -- but their methods of exploring them could hardly be more different.</p>
        <p>The difference, ultimately, is between easy sentiment and difficult emotion. Though ''Chuck and Buck,'' Miguel Arteta's new film, is frequently funny and always sincere, there is nothing cute or heartwarming about its view of childhood. It's an intimate, slightly creepy, often disturbing look at loneliness and need -- something, in other words, for the child in all of us.</p>
        <p>Like Jon Turteltaub's sudsy ''Kid,'' ''Chuck and Buck,'' which opens today at the Angelika Film Center, tells the story of a confident, successful man confronted by an unwelcome visitor from his boyhood, a reminder of painful memories and lost innocence. The revenant encountered by Charlie Sitter (Chris Weitz) is not a time-traveling younger incarnation of himself, as in ''The Kid,'' but rather his boyhood friend Buck (Mike White), who has gotten stuck in time. Buck is functional enough to keep himself supplied with lollipops -- his main source of nutrition, it seems -- and clean clothes. He can even drive a car. But for the most part he dwells in the mental and emotional world of the 11-year-old he was when he and Charlie, whom he insists on calling Chuck, were inseparable buddies.</p>
        <p>The film begins with a slow pan across Buck's bedroom, a visual inventory of the board games, figurines, model airplanes and cars that furnish his life. In the background we hear his mother coughing herself to death. Charlie, summoned by a handwritten letter on juvenile stationery, goes to the funeral, and Buck, after making a fumbling sexual advance at his old friend, decides to follow him to Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>There he installs himself -- along with his toys, his lollipops and his vaporizer -- in a motel, which soon becomes the base of one of the strangest stalking enterprises ever recorded on film. When Charlie rebuffs Buck's incessant phone calls and unannounced visits, Buck decides to catch his pal's conscience with a play called ''Hank and Frank,'' an allegory of their fairy-tale friendship and its cruel termination.</p>
        <p>With his weak, wobbly chin, pale skin and paler eyelashes, Mr. White is an uncanny embodiment of arrested development. His character elicits both protectiveness and revulsion. The movie's female characters -- Chuck's fiancee, Carlyn (Beth Colt); his assistant, Jamila (Maya Rudolph); and a sympathetic theater manager (Lupe Ontiveros) -- respond to his guileless, scary innocence with confusion, alarm and enough maternal solicitude to keep him from unraveling entirely. The audience may find it hard to believe that Mr. White is acting, despite a record of grown-up achievements that include producing several television shows and writing the script for this movie.</p>
        <p>''Chuck and Buck'' as a whole exhibits the quiet sensitivity and quicksilver intelligence that infuse Mr. White's performance. Ms. Ontiveros is especially fine in a role that is in many ways the key to the film; she's a bedrock of sanity and good humor. In a brilliant stroke of casting, Mr. Weitz's brother Paul appears as Sam, a thuggish would-be actor who becomes Buck's unlikely surrogate for the lost Chuck.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arteta, whose first feature was the arresting and offbeat ''Star Maps,'' presents Buck's world with delicacy and tact, but he never flinches from the more discomfiting implications of the story. Buck's childlike longing for attention and acceptance expresses itself as sexual desire. He is desperate not only to recapture the intimacy he and Charlie knew as boys, but also to revive the sexual play that was part of their bond. How this longing is resolved is both shocking and, by the time it happens, entirely credible.</p>
        <p>''Chuck and Buck'' is a strange, intense and moving film about friendship and loss, an antidote to the current epidemic of lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore, magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to see this year.</p>
        <p>''Chuck and Buck'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual references and situations.</p>
