        <p>Disney's 'The Kid'  Bruce Willis, Spencer Breslin, Emily Mortimer, Lily Tomlin, Jean Smart  Directed by Jon Turteltaub  PG 101 minutes</p>
        <p>As an ''image consultant,'' Russ Duritz (Mr. Willis) makes a lot of money telling entrepreneurs to lose the beard if they want to make the front page of The Wall Street Journal. As a person, he prides himself on arrogant aloofness and is called a jerk four times a day. That bothers the chubby little boy (Spencer Breslin) who suddenly materializes inside Duritz's Hollywood compound.</p>
        <p>On first sight of him Russ orders the security turned up to electrocution level. Shortly afterward, however, he finds Kid, as Duritz dubs him, munching popcorn in front of his television set. After the consternation subsides, both make a discovery. Kid is really Russ Duritz when he was about to turn 8, and he is there to find out what has gone so wrong in Russ's life that he's about to turn 40 loveless, childless and (here's the crusher) dogless.</p>

        <p>Disney's 'The Kid'  Bruce Willis, Spencer Breslin, Emily Mortimer, Lily Tomlin, Jean Smart  Directed by Jon Turteltaub  PG 101 minutes</p>
        <p>As an ''image consultant,'' Russ Duritz (Mr. Willis) makes a lot of money telling entrepreneurs to lose the beard if they want to make the front page of The Wall Street Journal. As a person, he prides himself on arrogant aloofness and is called a jerk four times a day. That bothers the chubby little boy (Spencer Breslin) who suddenly materializes inside Duritz's Hollywood compound.</p>
        <p>On first sight of him Russ orders the security turned up to electrocution level. Shortly afterward, however, he finds Kid, as Duritz dubs him, munching popcorn in front of his television set. After the consternation subsides, both make a discovery. Kid is really Russ Duritz when he was about to turn 8, and he is there to find out what has gone so wrong in Russ's life that he's about to turn 40 loveless, childless and (here's the crusher) dogless.</p>
        <p>More or less the same question plagues Amy (Ms. Mortimer), Russ's attractive assistant. She and Kid make friends; in fact, Kid, realizing the opportunity his older self is wasting, actually proposes to Amy.</p>
        <p>But Russ goes on spurning everybody, especially Kid. In boyhood Rusty, as he was called, was a bit of a klutz, with social troubles in school and a father who relentlessly applied pressure. Regarding his childhood self as a loser, Russ doesn't want any part of the little boy in him now. ''Russ, we have to change,'' says Kid.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE None.  SEX None.  PROFANITY None.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?  AGES 3-8 Kid gets some pretty rough emotional treatment at times, and this could distress young children.  AGES 9 AND UP Mr. Willis has already had one spectacularly successful collaboration with a child character in ''The Sixth Sense.'' Here the boy's relation to the man is cuter and more manipulative, and the film, while exploring childhood stress and exhorting family values, lacks the same kind of intrigue.</p>
        <p>The Perfect Storm  George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane, Elizabeth Mastrantonio, William Fichtner, Karen Allen, Allen Payne, Bob Gunton, John C. Reilly  Directed by Wolfgang Petersen  PG-13 150 minutes</p>
        <p>''Could be a triple-header,'' says Linda Greenlaw (Ms. Mastrantonio) over the radio to the sword-boat skipper Billy Tyne (Mr. Clooney). With the swordfish scarce and scrawny on the Grand Banks, Billy has headed the 90-foot Andrea Gail east toward a dangerous but more fish-filled area called the Flemish Cap. Heading toward Billy are a combination of weather conditions ranked in the ''oh, my God'' category.</p>
        <p>First there is Hurricane Grace out in the Atlantic. Descending from Canada is a cold front, and off Nova Scotia another disturbance is waiting to merge with the other two. ''A disaster of epic proportions,'' says an excited weatherman, practically climbing into his computer monitor.</p>
        <p>Digital effects churn the seas into black cliffs. A huge container ship staggers in mountainous swells, spraying tons of cargo from its decks. A sailboat with three people aboard rolls completely over and rights itself, the crew sputtering and yelling mayday. A rescue helicopter falls into the maelstrom.</p>
        <p>On the Andrea Gail, still north of major trouble, the crewman Bobby Shatford (Mr. Wahlberg) is starting to get a bad feeling. A shark washes on deck and chomps his leg. A rogue wave nearly flips the boat. Fishermen are tossed overboard. When the ice compressor breaks, Billy swings around and heads back for Gloucester, their Massachusetts port.</p>
        <p>By then they are in the teeth of a 100-year storm. Billy turns again and tries to run before a following sea. But the ocean, whipped several ways at once, is back-watering, so to speak, and the waves are coming from everywhere. The Andrea Gail is seaworthy, but it can't go vertical.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE There are some nasty accidents, and everybody gets mugged by the ocean.  SEX Back in Gloucester, where the women wait, there are suggestive situations.  PROFANITY The talk is salty.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?  AGES 3-8 It gets scary on the water. Parents have been sighted fleeing theaters with very small children.  AGES 9-11 Put on the life vests, but most viewers should ride it out. The not exactly scintillating preliminaries setting up the story will claim more victims than the storm.  AGES 12 AND UP Beyond big waves this isn't a film with much appeal for teenagers.</p>
        <p>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle  Rene Russo, Jason Alexander, Robert De Niro, Randy Quaid, Janeane Garofalo, Piper Perabo and the voices of June Foray and Keith Scott  Directed by Des McAnuff  PG 88 minutes</p>
        <p>In 1964 Lyndon Johnson won in a walk and ''Rocky and Bullwinkle'' cartoons spread their goofy charm on the tube. Now, though, residual checks for the squirrel and the moose have shrunk to three and a half cents, and their hometown, Frostbite Falls, Minn., is a melting ruin. A trip to Washington seems to be in order -- for what neither of them is sure -- and off they go at about the same time their old cold war foes from Pottsylvania, Fearless Leader, Boris and Natasha, are springing themselves from cartoonland altogether.</p>
        <p>Having tricked a television executive (Ms. Garofalo), the three jump out of a television set and become human. Fearless Leader (Mr. De Niro with dueling scars and a greased-down skull-cap hairdo) plans to take over the United States by turning the populace into zombies with very bad television. (What else is new?)</p>
        <p>A cherubic F.B.I. agent, Karen Sympathy (Ms. Perabo), is sent to squelch the scheme. Hooked on ''Rocky and Bullwinkle'' reruns during her formative years, she enlists them for the struggle.</p>
        <p>Fearless Leader counters by assigning Boris (Mr. Alexander) and Natasha (Ms. Russo) to get rid of all opposition. After a cross-country chase they fetch up in New York, where a 6-foot-7-inch talking moose wouldn't get a glance anyway, let alone with the whole city zombified.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE The live-action figures try some cartoon-style mayhem, but to little lasting effect. For Rocky and Bullwinkle the problem is that as their old cartoon selves in a live-action world, they really do go splat falling from heights. Don't worry: they recover as ever.  SEX None.  PROFANITY A modicum.</p>
        <p>For Which Children  AGES 3-9 With cameo appearances by John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg and Jonathan Winters, the film seems as geared to baby boomers who doted on Rocky and Bullwinkle in the 60's as it is to current little ones. Still, there's nothing more cartoonish than an upright moose and a flying squirrel.  AGES 10 AND UP The film is neither here nor there for older children. Many of the live characters are too old and far removed, and much of the dialogue falls flat.</p>
