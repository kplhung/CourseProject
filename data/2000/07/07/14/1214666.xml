        <p>Whenever someone wears a collarless shirt in a movie, it's a signal that there's something otherworldly about him, part of the tradition that includes Bruce Lee, Steven Segal and Ben Kingsley in ''Gandhi.'' And such is the case with Steven Grslcz (Jude Law), the languid, parchment-pale vampire in ''The Wisdom of Crocodiles.'' It's the kind of picture in which the bloodsucker is so chic he probably uses the spelling ''vampyre.''</p>
        <p>As Steven takes to his victims, a decorative splatter of arterial blood hits the backlighted bedroom wall of his groovy bachelor pad. As he labels crystalline shards with the names of his female victims and scribbles ''despair'' and ''disappointment'' in notebooks, there's a glint of despair and disappointment in his mostly impassive eyes, an expression you will soon recognize on fellow audience members if you're in a theater showing ''Wisdom,'' which opens today at the Angelika Film Center.</p>

        <p>Whenever someone wears a collarless shirt in a movie, it's a signal that there's something otherworldly about him, part of the tradition that includes Bruce Lee, Steven Segal and Ben Kingsley in ''Gandhi.'' And such is the case with Steven Grslcz (Jude Law), the languid, parchment-pale vampire in ''The Wisdom of Crocodiles.'' It's the kind of picture in which the bloodsucker is so chic he probably uses the spelling ''vampyre.''</p>
        <p>As Steven takes to his victims, a decorative splatter of arterial blood hits the backlighted bedroom wall of his groovy bachelor pad. As he labels crystalline shards with the names of his female victims and scribbles ''despair'' and ''disappointment'' in notebooks, there's a glint of despair and disappointment in his mostly impassive eyes, an expression you will soon recognize on fellow audience members if you're in a theater showing ''Wisdom,'' which opens today at the Angelika Film Center.</p>
        <p>Steven is also the kind of vampire who may have spent too much time reading Anne Rice, since his life has the fruity morbidity associated with her vampire Lestat. He seeks victims who fall in love with him, so that he can drain the love from their bloodstreams. Otherwise he sucks down despair and disappointment, which are taking a physical toll on him: he is dying and needs to find pure love to stay alive.</p>
        <p>Much of Steven's dialogue sounds like the kind of florid pick-up lines better used on second-year literature students or the kind of lonely women seen only in movies. He comes up with insights like the three-brains theory, saying that everyone has three brains: human, mammalian and reptilian. Not only does this lofty locution confuse his victims, who were probably under the illusion that humans were mammals, but it also makes one wonder which brain was responsible for the script.</p>
        <p>Despite such lines, and ideas borrowed from Ms. Rice and David Cronenberg -- Steven's dissipation feels like an AIDS metaphor, as did Jeff Goldblum's state in Mr. Cronenberg's ''Fly'' -- ''Crocodile'' is too enervated to be garish. Even when a slow-witted gang whose leader looks like a teddy boy from one of the musical numbers in the 1985 film ''Absolute Beginners'' -- and is about as threatening -- shows up, the movie seems bloodless. Mr. Law doesn't disgrace himself here, though he doesn't have much to do, and the director, Po Chih Leong, is deft at creating atmosphere, but it's an atmosphere we've all seen before.</p>
        <p>Steven is being tracked by the dogged but kindly Inspector Healey (Timothy Spall, who gets to offer some feeling that is either human or mammalian, since he doesn't have to be cloaked in stylish dissolution). When Steven chats with Healey about the nature of evil, it's almost as if he is trying to pick up the detective, but the movie doesn't follow up on the pansexual vampire idea, since it has a prescribed number of marks to hit.</p>
        <p>And most of those marks are hit when Steven pursues Anne, played by Elina Lowensohn, who for the first time in her career has found someone paler than herself to play against (no small feat, since she has been in Hal Hartley movies and played a vampire herself in ''Nadia''). Anne is moody and thin-skinned, and her temperament, which suggests passion, brings dramatic tension to her scenes. It was a good idea to make her not easily won over, though sadly that's one of the few ideas ''Wisdom'' has.</p>
        <p>''The Wisdom of Crocodiles'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nudity, violence and bloodletting.</p>
