        <p>Opposition lawmakers have disclosed the names of about 3,300 wealthy debtors linked to questionable bank loans that became part of a huge government bailout.</p>
        <p>Deputies from the Party of the Democratic Revolution disclosed the names at a press conference, held late Wednesday. Computer hackers hired by the party cracked codes protecting the debtors' list on a compact disc.</p>
        <p>Calling the loans ''a great fraud against the nation,'' Pablo Gomez, head of the party's congressional delegation, assailed the government and the bail-out agency, saying they pursued ''a policy of absolute freedom for bankers.'' In the list of suspicious loans is an album of top-echelon magnates who were close to the government and fell into deep financial trouble after the currency crash of 1995. It includes a loan to a brother of Rogelio Montemayor Seguy, the current director of Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, the state-owned oil company, and another to a relative of a governing party senator.</p>
        <p>Also listed is a $5 million loan for a car race track belonging to Jorge Hank Rhon, the son of a veteran governing party politician.</p>
        <p>A $422,000 loan went directly to the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in the state of Jalisco. The party defaulted on the debt.</p>
        <p>The list was compiled by a Canadian auditor, Michael Mackey. The congress hired him in 1998 to make a thorough audit of the bank rescue. He drew up the list after sifting through tens of thousands of loans in the bail-out agency's portfolio.</p>
        <p>His list details loans totaling $7.8 billion that Mr. Mackey found to be seriously irregular, either because they did not meet bank credit standards or because they were made to people and companies with direct business ties to the lenders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mackey's list also includes loans to several prominent bankers who are known to be facing criminal prosecution for huge frauds.</p>
        <p>Legal action has begun in hundreds of cases from the Mackey list.</p>
        <p>The entire bank rescue so far has cost Mexican taxpayers $100 billion.  The government jumped in to shore up the financial system when it nearly collapsed in 1995, as interest rates skyrocketed and millions of Mexicans defaulted on their debts. Finance officials were obliged to act because all Mexican bank deposits at that time were fully government insured.</p>
        <p>The officials argued that they did what they had to do to avert catastrophe.</p>
        <p>Opposition lawmakers charge that that gave the banks the opportunity to fob off billions of dollars in illegal loans that are now being paid by the taxpayers. They say that the bailout agency should not have agreed to pay for those loans.</p>
        <p>The records of the bail-out agency are confidential, protected by bank secrecy laws, as was Mr. Mackey's auditing report. By agreement with the parties in congress, Mr. Mackey put the list of potentially illegal loans on one compact disc and provided separate secret codes to each of the main parties, so that they could see the list if they all agreed.</p>
        <p>President Ernesto Zedillo and his party, the PRI, refused to provide their code and blocked every opposition effort to release information on the suspect loans.</p>
        <p>The Party of the Democratic Revolution, or P.R.D., was alone in demanding disclosure until May. Then, in a flourish during a televised debate among presidential candidates, Vicente Fox trumped the P.R.D. by handing over an envelope that he said contained his party's secret codes to the disc. Mr. Fox, from the center-right National Action Party, or PAN won the July 2 vote.</p>
        <p>But it turned out that those codes were not the right ones. Fauzi Hamdan, a federal deputy who is the PAN's point man on the bail-out, admitted that he gave Mr. Fox mistaken codes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamdan has made it clear that he does not agree with the opposition releasing bail-out information in violation of their accord with Mr. Mackey. In the end he did turn over the PAN's codes, but the PRI did not offer its numbers.</p>
        <p>More than $200 million in loans went to three construction companies that grew into giants during the years when the Mexican government offered a steady flow of contracts.</p>
        <p>All three companies flirted with bankruptcy during the crisis. But the executives who head them, Juan Diego Gutierrez Cortina of GUTSA, David Penaloza of Grupo Tribasa and Jorge Ballesteros of Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, remain prominently wealthy.</p>
        <p>Jesus Maria Montemayor Seguy, the Pemex director's sibling, received a $190,669 loan which went into the bail-out. The loan to Ignacio Santos de Hoyo was for $6.6 million. Alberto Santos de Hoyo is the PRI senator from the state of Nuevo Leon.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the bail-out agency said that criminal or civil legal action has been brought in about 300 of the cases on the Mackey list.</p>
