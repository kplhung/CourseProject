        <p>DIAMOND-Irwin. On July 12, 2000. Beloved husband for 53 years of Pearl, devoted father of Dennis, Matthew and Cori, father-in-law to Elizabeth Geiger, Rae Kraus, Steve Baustin and the late Art DeFrancis. Patriarch and leader, he leaves behind an adoring family including best friend and brotherin-law Irving Ziffer, grandchildren, Sarah, Jacqueline, Liana, Gabriel, Alexander and David, Angelia, Debbie, Barry, Steven and Jason, great-grandchildren, Rachel, Nicole, Sydney and Jessica, nephews and nieces, Marshall, Emily, Jody, Debbie, Harold, Wendy, Adam, Sarah, Ben, Jon, Sophie and Lily Karp.
