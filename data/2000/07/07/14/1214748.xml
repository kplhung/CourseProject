        <p>Time Warner Trade Publishing yesterday acquired the right to publish a book by John F. Welch Jr., the widely admired chairman of the General Electric Company, for a record advance of $7.1 million, more than advances paid for books by Gen. Colin L. Powell or the pope.</p>
        <p>Publishers involved in the bidding war said the high level of interest in the book reflected the growing obsession with business and the stock market. Americans are working more hours and, in an overheated job market, seeking more rewarding work, said Carolyn Reidy, president of the trade division at Simon &amp; Schuster, one of the unsuccessful bidders. In the meantime, interest in saving for retirement has spread a new fascination with investing. The eye-popping sum also testified, they said, to a masterful sales job by Mr. Welch.</p>

        <p>Time Warner Trade Publishing yesterday acquired the right to publish a book by John F. Welch Jr., the widely admired chairman of the General Electric Company, for a record advance of $7.1 million, more than advances paid for books by Gen. Colin L. Powell or the pope.</p>
        <p>Publishers involved in the bidding war said the high level of interest in the book reflected the growing obsession with business and the stock market. Americans are working more hours and, in an overheated job market, seeking more rewarding work, said Carolyn Reidy, president of the trade division at Simon &amp; Schuster, one of the unsuccessful bidders. In the meantime, interest in saving for retirement has spread a new fascination with investing. The eye-popping sum also testified, they said, to a masterful sales job by Mr. Welch.</p>
        <p>''This is a book that many of us have wanted to publish for years -- a one-of-a- kind book by the kind of person who comes along once in a century,'' said Maureen Egen, president of Time Warner Trade Publishing, a unit of Time Warner Inc., who met with Mr. Welch and bought the book. ''He is an amazing teacher. Just in the time we spent with him we learned so much.''</p>
        <p>The news of the advance -- believed to be a record for a one-time work of nonfiction -- immediately drew skepticism from some people in the book business. An executive at the Tattered Cover, a bookstore in Denver, and other editors in New York said they had never heard of Mr. Welch. Others questioned the size of the advance.</p>
        <p>The contract includes only rights to sell the book in North America, leaving Mr. Welch and his agent the right to sell foreign rights and first-excerpt rights to others. Foreign rights are expected to be lucrative because Mr. Welch has a cult following among businessmen in some other countries, notably Japan.</p>
        <p>To pay off a $7.1 million advance on royalties would require sales in North America of about 1.6 million hardcover books. Only one or two titles a year sell more than one million copies. A recent best seller by William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, sold about half a million copies.</p>
        <p>Nor is this the first book to trade on Mr. Welch's reputation as a business savant. Half a dozen books have already tapped that market, including ''Jack Welch and the G.E. Way,'' (McGraw-Hill, 1998), and three other books written by Robert Slater with Mr. Welch's extensive cooperation. Their editor, Jeffrey Krames at the McGraw-Hill Companies, said books about Mr. Welch are among the company's top sellers, with a total of about half a million copies in print around the world.</p>
        <p>The long shelf of Welch books has even drawn an anti-Welch backlash -- ''At Any Cost: Jack Welch, General Electric, and the Pursuit of Profit'' by Thomas F. O'Boyle (Random House, 1998).</p>
        <p>But Mr. Welch wanted to leave posterity his own account of his business philosphy. He will retire next year, at age 65, he after a 20-year stint at the helm of General Electric. He lifted the company from a motley conglomerate with a market value of about $12 billion to one of the world's largest and most widely admired companies, with a market value of more than $500 billion. As Mr. Welch reminded prospective publishers in meetings last week, the company has delivered to shareholders an average annual return of more than 20 percent during his tenure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch has teamed up to write the book with John A. Byrne, a writer for Business Week magazine and the author of a critical book about another hard-charging executive, Al Dunlop. Mr. Byrne two years ago spent six months researching a profile of Mr. Welch for the magazine.</p>
        <p>To sell the project, Mr. Welch tapped Mark Reiter, 48, a literary agent with the predominantly sports marketing firm International Management Group. Mr. Reiter is not a big-name agent in the literary world, but his boss, Mark McCormack, International Management's founder, is a friend of Mr. Welch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reiter wasted no time in closing a deal, in part to keep the pressure on the bidders. He sent out a brief proposal for the book along with Mr. Byrne's profile of his subject shortly before the Fourth of July. Several publishers immediately called to try and make pre-emptive bids. ''I didn't even need to read the proposal to know I wanted to buy the book,'' said Stephen Rubin, president of the Broadway-Doubleday unit of the Bertelsmann Group.</p>
        <p>On July 5, Mr. Reiter called the publishers to set a $4 million minimum bid. Four publishers made the cut and each met for an hour last Friday with Mr. Welch, Mr. Reiter and Mr. Byrne at the G.E. executive's office in Rockefeller Center.</p>
        <p>First was Warner, followed by the News Corporation's HarperCollins, Bertelsmann's Doubleday and finally Simon &amp; Schuster, a unit of Viacom Inc. Mr. Welch's secretary concealed the appointment list so that none of the publishers knew the names of their rivals. Each sent teams of about half a dozen executives. Executives of Doubleday had prepared a complete book jacket and marketing plan to pitch to Mr. Welch.</p>
        <p>Sitting in his shirt sleeves at a conference table, Mr. Welch preferred discussing his ideas about management over marketing details, the publishers said. Executives  said Mr. Welch interrupted prepared presentations and caught them off guard by candidly challenging them to top the other publishers' ideas. He took out a notepad to draw diagrams illustrating such subjects as the challenges facing Internet companies.</p>
        <p>At the one point, the conversation turned to Lee Iacocca, the legendary chairman of Chrysler Motors whose autobiography sold 2.6 million copies in hardcover and 3.5 million in paperback in North America. Mr. Welch told them that he would consider a book like Mr. Iacocca's a failure, because it was about a personality rather than ideas. Mr. Welch said he preferred the 1964 book by Alfred P. Sloan, ''My Years With General Motors,'' which lives on as a business school perennial.</p>
        <p>Bidding started Monday morning in a flurry of phone calls to Mr. Reiter's office. It opened at $4.1 million and when it reached $6.5 million -- about the advances paid to Colin Powell and Pope John Paul II for worldwide rights -- Doubleday and Simon &amp; Schuster dropped out. At $7.1 million, Mr. Welch and Mr. Reiter halted bidding to evaluate the two finalists' marketing plans and become acquainted with their executives. Among other things, Warner executives discussed marketing opportunities from their company's pending merger with America Online.</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch's book is scheduled for publication next year, a tight deadline to roughly coincide with his retirement. He plans to give his share of the advance to educational charities. At a typical agent's commission of 15 percent, Mr. Reiter will net about $1 million. But that does not include the foreign rights.</p>
