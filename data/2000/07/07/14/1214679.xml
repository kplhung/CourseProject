        <p>A LOT has changed about the art world during the 20 years or so since Barbara Kruger came onto the scene with her photomontages, but a lot has not changed about her work. Depending on one's perspective, she has bravely stuck to her guns or she's become a one-note relic. Either way, her retrospective, which has landed at the Whitney from the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where it was even bigger and flashier, represents a career whose concerns were fixed, as were the arguments about it, by the early 80's.</p>
        <p>Let's put off those arguments for just a moment to delay what has become a familiar and fairly dreary debate over politics and art. You probably know Ms. Kruger's work, even if you don't recognize her name. Not many contemporary artists can say their art has reached masses of people outside the art circuit. Ms. Kruger can.</p>
        <p>Her message-bearing billboards, magazine covers, op-ed illustrations and window displays (there's one now at Saks on Fifth Avenue), along with her designs for T-shirts, coffee mugs, baseball caps and tote bags have made her art part of the visual culture at large. There have even been knockoffs. The recent pro-abortion rights advertising campaign in the New York City subways is one.</p>
        <p>It's hard to say whether Ms. Kruger's own messages about women, money and power have in the slightest way changed the minds of these anonymous masses whose minds she presumes need changing. But just the visual format of the work, the trademark red, white and black text-and-photograph montage, became, if nothing else, a brand product of the immediate past.</p>
        <p>She hit upon her style by the early 80's, borrowing heavily from Russian Constructivism, Hannah Hoch, John Heartfield and advertising. The style consists of red frames enclosing old black-and-white pictures culled from magazines, manuals and photographic annuals. The pictures are overlaid with words in bold italics. Ms. Kruger favors offbeat and opaque photographs, 40's and 50's vintage, often funny. Her texts are short, blunt and accusatory; they are sometimes cliches, egregiously sarcastic, inferentially linked to the photographs. Pronouns, liberally used, incline toward you, we and I.</p>
        <p>''When I hear the word culture I take out my checkbook,'' across a photograph of a ventriloquist's dummy, is a typical print from the mid-80's that you'll find in the Whitney show. As is usual with Ms. Kruger's work, the implications that money corrupts art and that rich collectors are dummies become a joke, which does not quite resolve the tricky problem that her art is a part of the commodity culture it ridicules. And not a cheap commodity, by the way. But that is another matter.</p>
        <p>Dense and noisy, the Whitney exhibition, including audio embellishments, has an intended carnival atmosphere without frivolity. Your reaction will necessarily depend on a blend of generational sympathy, political concord, aesthetic expectation and sense of humor. People tend to praise political art that confirms their own politics. But an art about control and button pushing demands that you give yourself over to it completely. If not -- well, then you are missing the point or don't get the joke or aren't trying hard enough or actually hate political art or hate women or hate yourself. ''Your comfort is my silence'' accompanies a picture of a man holding a finger over his lips. Notice once again Ms. Kruger's use of pronouns.</p>
        <p>She has packaged her messages variously, printing images on vinyl and on convex lenses called lenticulars. She has engraved them into metal plates. She has designed video installations and sculptures.</p>
        <p>The show starts with an adaptation of an installation she did for Mary Boone's gallery years ago: ''All violence is the illustration of a pathetic stereotype,'' printed big on a wall, flanked by screaming faces and sandwiched into a list of racial and ethnic epithets. In the room directly behind this installation is a sculpture, from a recent Boone show, of John and Robert Kennedy beaming, a peek-a-boo Marilyn Monroe on their shoulders. Another installation, of videos of scolding heads in a room with projected texts, pushes confrontation to an extreme -- you may judge it to be condescension rather than confrontation -- borrowing a tip or two from the work of Bruce Nauman, minus his essential black humor.</p>
        <p>Being a product of her generation, Ms. Kruger articulates its familiar obsessions and self-regard. She was born in Newark in 1945, and studied with Diane Arbus and Marvin Israel at the Parsons School of Design in the 60's, getting a background in photography and graphic design. A starter job at Mademoiselle magazine turned into a position as head designer. She quit full-time magazine work after a while and began to write poetry, dabbled in painting and made woven pieces of brightly patterned cloth laced with metallic yarn and sequins, one example of which was in the 1973 Whitney Biennial.</p>
        <p>Then in the mid-70's she switched gears, juxtaposing deadpan photographs with texts. She took her own pictures at first, of parts of the outside of nondescript stucco buildings. The photographs looked like the work of the Los Angeles artist Ed Ruscha, which Ms. Kruger says didn't occur to her. Accompanying her pictures were paragraphs she wrote about imaginary people, presumably in the buildings. Personal melodrama belied anonymous architecture. Distress beneath implacable surface became an essential ingredient in her artistic recipe.</p>
        <p>For ''Hospital'' (1978) the texts shrank to short phrases or words. She printed ''the manipulation of the object/the blaming of the victim/the accusation of hysteria/the making mute'' beside a photograph of tongue depressors, for example.</p>
        <p>It was then simply a matter of superimposing text onto image, which she did in a 1980 collage of a woman on a bed with a fashion magazine, the image stamped ''deluded.'' Ms. Kruger had gone full circle back to Mademoiselle, which prints words on its cover photograph every month, except, of course, that her messages were different.</p>
        <p>Borrowing pictures rather than photographing them made Ms. Kruger one of the appropriationists of the 80's. The issues they raised can seem trite now: how photographs create reality, how the media shape power and reinforce stereotypes. Feminist artists being particularly focused on stereotypes of women, Ms. Kruger was linked most closely with a group that included Louise Lawler, Sarah Charlesworth, Cindy Sherman, Silvia Kolbowski, Yvonne Rainer and Chantal Akerman.</p>
        <p>Does it need to be said again how victim credentials often came before aesthetic value? Or that choosing the art community as a context in which to denounce elitism always seemed strangely contradictory and unreflective? These things having been pointed out ad nauseam, we might say instead that Ms. Kruger was one of the 80's artists adapting Conceptualism via mass-media forms for political ends, thereby helping to broaden the purview of contemporary art, if not necessarily to change the world.</p>
        <p>The art world became more sex-balanced by the end of the 90's, which was certainly a contribution. The already shaky hierarchy involving fine art, photography, graphic design, film and video was further disturbed. This allowed the next generation of artists to move about more freely and un-self-consciously among different media.</p>
        <p>Which is where we are today.</p>
        <p>And where is Ms. Kruger? It's hard to get too worked up about her art any longer. An art that lives by the rules of advertising dies by the rules of advertising. Politicians and Madison Avenue executives know to accommodate the shifting mood. Strategies change so that the messages won't. Images now get old by the minute. Watch television: beer ads about beer ads' being manipulative try to manipulate a generation that takes for granted what artists in the 80's evidently found shocking about mass-media manipulation.</p>
        <p>As for what has happened inside art, young artists reacting against the previous political stridency now explore subtler, more aesthetically varied routes toward expressions of selfhood. Ms. Kruger, operating at the same pitch and in the same modes as before, occupies a curious place. She helped to pave the way for her own diminished currency.</p>
        <p>For a political artist, at least, this probably should be viewed as a kind of success.</p>
        <p>''Barbara Kruger'' remains at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through Oct. 22.</p>
