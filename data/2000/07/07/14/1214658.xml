        <p>Today is Bastille Day, and to celebrate the fall of the Bastille in Paris in 1789 and the start of the French Revolution, some of New York's French restaurants, including the 12 below, are offering special dishes or full menus for a symbolic price of $17.89. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)</p>
        <p>1. L'Absinthe  *  [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 794-4950</p>
        <p>227 East 67th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The etched glass, mirrors, polished brass and ancient clocks in this gorgeous restaurant give it the familiar warmth of a brasserie, and it serves some of the best old-fashioned food, like saucisson chaud, generous slices of poached sausage with potatoes and lentils. Desserts are always impeccable; there is not a crisper, more buttery or better warm apple tart in all New York. At dinner only, L'Absinthe is offering an entree special of braised trout stuffed with wild mushrooms on a bed of warm lentil salad with a spice reduction.</p>

        <p>2. Bistro le Steak</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 517-3800</p>
        <p>1309 Third Avenue, at 75th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Bistro le Steak hardly strikes a false note. It looks Parisian, the friendly staff conveys warmth and informality, and the food is both good and an excellent value. Yes, the specialty is steak, with five choices. The Parisian cut sirloin is firm and full of beefy flavor, served with a mountain of crisp, salty fries. The New York rib-eye is quite good, though not so flavorful as the sirloin. Filet mignon, offered plain and au poivre, is perfectly tender, though also not so beefy. Desserts are terrific, like the rich, dense chocolate cake with crushed macadamia nuts hidden in it and the exuberant lemon tart. Bistro le Steak's $17.89 special is a two-course dinner of an apple and goat cheese salad and roasted breast of duck.</p>
        <p>3. Capsouto Freres</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 966-4900</p>
        <p>451 Washington Street</p>
        <p>TriBeCa</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Capsouto Freres was a TriBeCa pioneer, moving into a fine old 1891 landmark building long before the area became chic. The dining room is a pleasant, airy space with brick walls, wood floors and beautiful light. Although the bistro fare is sometimes disappointing, the restaurant is popular. The Bastille Day entree specials include quenelles de brochet with lobster Sauternes sauce; and blanquette de veaux with rice pilaf.</p>
        <p>4. La Caravelle  ***  [Rating: 3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 586-4252</p>
        <p>33 West 55th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>La Caravelle is a French restaurant of the old school, one of the last places in New York that make you feel like dressing up. No restaurant in the city does a better job of guarding its traditions while honoring the present. For Bastille Day, the tables will be decorated with red, white and blue ribbons and American and French miniflags. Special entrees will be offered at the $17.89 price only at lunch, and they are ballotine de poularde Marat (stuffed boneless chicken) and boeuf a la mode de la rue de Valois (beef stew with vegetables). These dishes will also be available on the pretheater menu for $27.89.</p>
        <p>5. Destinee  **  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 888-1220</p>
        <p>134 East 61st Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Fancy French food, an intimate room and some moderate prices: no wonder this small restaurant has been such a hit. It is a quiet little corner of France, but not modern France. This is food so decorative that each plate makes you gasp. Destinee is offering a two-course lunch with a tomato confit tart appetizer and an entree of seared salmon steak served with asparagus.</p>
        <p>6. Les Halles  **  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 679-4111</p>
        <p>411 Park Avenue South, near 29th Street</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Taking its name from the legendary wholesale food market in Paris, Les Halles also functions as a meat market: it has butcher cases in the front and a room with the air of a real Parisian brasserie in the back, with wood molding, off-white walls, tulip sconces and tables draped in butcher paper. Les Halles is offering a special three-course menu celebrating both French and American independence, including dishes from both cultures. Appetizer choices are Vichyssoise and New England clam chowder. Entrees are roasted cod, either American style with corn pancakes and crayfish sauce, or French style in a seafood sauce with baby vegetables; and surf and turf, French style with chicken and crayfish or, for $10 more, American style with half a lobster and filet mignon. Desserts are cherry clafoutis and strawberry shortcake.</p>
        <p>7. Park Bistro  ***  [Rating: 3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 689-1360</p>
        <p>414 Park Avenue South, at 29th Street</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>A classic French bistro, from the decor (photos of Paris in the 1950's) to the menu (magret, onglet and so forth). It offers seductive Gallic fare, good wines at reasonable prices and a cozy setting. There is also a large selection of tea and several coffees. Park Bistro's $17.89 special (lunch and dinner) is chicken fricassee Provencal style with a glass of Cote de Brouilly.</p>
        <p>8. Payard Patisserie And Bistro  **  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 717-5252</p>
        <p>1032 Lexington Avenue, at 73rd Street</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Payard is a joint venture of Daniel Boulud and his former pastry chef at Restaurant Daniel, Francois Payard. The pedigree shows. The place has the turn-of-the-century airs of a grand cafe, all dark wood, banquettes and high ceilings. Wading in to join the chic, sleek people who fill the room feels very good. Even the air smells wonderful, part sugar, part perfume, part roasted meat. The menu offers straightforward bistro fare with no apologies: steak frites, beef tartare, and bouillabaisse. All this, of course, is just a prelude to dessert. Mr. Payard's desserts are the best of France: clear, true flavors, beautifully presented. Payard is offering an entree special of bouillabaisse with rouget, mussels, clams and squid, served at lunch only.</p>
        <p>9. Raoul's  *  [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 966-3518</p>
        <p>180 Prince Street, at Sullivan Street</p>
        <p>SoHo</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This perpetually trendy spot, with a genuine neighborhood feel and hospitable staff, offers pleasing bistro fare. Although the booths are cramped and the prices are high, there is almost always someone famous in the room. For Bastille Day, Raoul's, which is not open for lunch, is offering a dinner entree of rabbit in mustard sauce served with polenta.</p>
        <p>10. Rene Pujol  **  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 246-3023</p>
        <p>321 West 51st Street</p>
        <p>Clinton</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Walk in the door and you know instantly that you are in a restaurant run by pros. The classic French restaurant has been feeding the theater district for a very long time, and it's still going strong. Unlike its neighbors, which serve bistro food, Rene Pujol proudly turns out high-end French fare in a civilized atmosphere. The Bastille Day lunch menu with a choice of an entree and either an appetizer or a dessert. Appetizers include onion tartlet with fresh thyme and bacon bits; and warm goat cheese on potato with red beet vinaigrette, mesclun and pignolis. Entrees are grilled salmon in lemon butter sauce; roast breast of chicken with herbal crust and tomato compote; and sauteed calf's liver with a balsamic vinaigrette jus. Dessert selections are rice pudding with vanilla ice cream; coconut custard; and chocolate mousse.</p>
        <p>11. Sono  **  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 752-4411</p>
        <p>106 East 57th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>It's fusion overdrive at Tadashi Ono's French-Japanese hybrid, one of the most distinctive restaurants to open in 1999. The flavors are unusual, and the combinations arresting, but fundamentally Ono prizes simplicity and purity. Shrimp in the shell, stir-fried with yuzu zest and sweet-hot shishito pepper, for example, brings a fresh intensity to shrimp. Surprises abound, as in tuna sashimi with avocado and dijon mustard, or the shockingly flavorful wasabi sauce that goes with the duck. For Bastille Day, Sono will offer a special dish of sauteed red snapper with artichoke fricassee, available at lunch only.</p>
        <p>12. Tout Va Bien</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 974-9051</p>
        <p>311 West 51st Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This is a classic New York City bistro in the theater district that has been around for 50 years serving just what you would expect in a rustic atmosphere. The Bastille Day menu, which will be served all day, offers a choice of a green salad or a mixed vegetable soup. Entree selections are pepper steak; chicken breast piccata with mushroom sauce; and cold salmon with mayonnaise and vegetables. Desserts are chocolate mousse or creme brulee. Coffee and cognac are included.</p>
