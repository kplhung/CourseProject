        <p>The second-highest-ranking official in the Police Department said yesterday that he was retiring to take a job as the director of worldwide security for Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>Patrick E. Kelleher, 53, the first deputy commissioner, joined the force in 1969 and rose to head the Internal Affairs Bureau and serve as chief of detectives before taking his current post in 1997. Whoever replaces him will have to run the department if Commissioner Howard Safir takes time off to treat his prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>For the past three years, Mr. Kelleher has overseen the department's disciplinary system and administered its budget, management and personnel and has represented the agency in labor talks. In that capacity, all transfers, promotions and firings of officers, and many other decisions, came across his desk.</p>
        <p>Commissioner Safir refused to discuss who would succeed Mr. Kelleher. But several senior officials have said that the likely candidates are Charles V. Campisi, the chief of the Internal Affairs Bureau, Joseph P. Dunne, the chief of department and Martin B. O'Boyle, the chief of the Organized Crime Control Bureau.</p>
