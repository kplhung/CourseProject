        <p>A July 7 editorial criticizes me for proposing that high schools add a fifth year for struggling students.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A July 7 editorial criticizes me for proposing that high schools add a fifth year for struggling students. What I stressed, however, was not time but a different kind of program for potential dropouts, older students for whom the standards movement and ending social promotion came too late. Many lack basic skills, and most secondary teachers lack the specialized training to help them.</p>
        <p>Ways to address this have not been made available to secondary schools, so I solicited help from the adult literacy and military communities, which have this expertise. I also proposed immediately expanding promising programs to all at-risk youth.</p>
        <p>Your editorial argues that a fifth year could weaken standards. But not acting virtually guarantees a higher dropout rate, which always produces pressure to lower standards.</p>
        <p>SANDRA FELDMAN  President  American Federation of Teachers  Washington, July 10, 2000</p>
