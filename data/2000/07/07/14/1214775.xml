        <p>A federal court has lifted a three-month suspension of the so-called Megan's Law, freeing New Jersey to again issue warnings about paroled sex offenders to neighbors, schools and centers for women and children near parolees' homes.</p>
        <p>A three-judge panel of a federal appeals court in Philadelphia decided to end the ban on Wednesday while it reviewed the New Jersey public defender's challenge to the constitutionality of the law's notification rules.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit contends that the rules, enacted in March by the New Jersey attorney general, John J. Farmer, violate the right to privacy because they are too weak to prevent the addresses of parolees from being disclosed illegally. A different three-judge panel on the court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, imposed the notification ban on April 18, when the public defender's appeal was filed.</p>
        <p>The second panel lifted the ban without explanation after hearing oral arguments in the case. It has yet to issue a final decision.</p>
        <p>The dispute centers on two rules intended to prevent personal information about a parolee from reaching people not authorized by a judge to receive it.</p>
        <p>One provision gives a person who is legally entitled to the information the choice of signing a pledge not to share the information improperly. Those who sign the pledge expose themselves to court penalties for violating it, and they are told the exact home address of a parolee.</p>
        <p>Those who refuse to sign are given the street name and block of the parolee's home. Mr. Farmer has said the provision strikes a balance between public safety and a parolee's privacy, but the public defender's suit contends that it does little to protect a parolee's exact address.</p>
        <p>Another issue in dispute is the lack of a statewide system for penalizing unauthorized disclosures. Only 10 of the state's 21 counties have systems that enable a judge to issue contempt citations. A uniform system is being considered by the State Supreme Court, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Edward L. Barocas, a deputy assistant public defender who is arguing the case, said that his office and the attorney general's had approved the revisions. If the Supreme Court agrees with them and orders them to be carried out, the issue will be dropped from the challenge in federal court, Mr. Barocas said.</p>
