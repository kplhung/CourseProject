        <p>A tentative deal has been reached in the House of Representatives on a bitterly fought bill to ban most forms of gambling on the Internet, clearing the way for a floor vote as early as next week.</p>
        <p>The bill attempts to curb one of the fastest-growing activities on the Internet, wagering on casino-style games and sporting events. Industry analysts say there are more than 700 unregulated wagering sites on the Web, generating more than $1.2 billion annually in bets, with more sites appearing every day and the amount  wagered doubling yearly.</p>
        <p>The legislation has created a number of odd alliances and has fattened the bank accounts of some of the most powerful lobbying and law firms in Washington. Evangelical Christian groups have lined up with horse-track operators and liquor store owners to support the bill. Republican governors have joined with online sports bookies and operators of cyber casinos based in Antigua and Belize to try to kill it.</p>
        <p>The measure, strongly backed by major sports leagues and the Nevada gambling industry, is an attempt to halt the rapid growth of online betting on casino-style games and professional and college sports by anyone with access to a personal computer, modem and credit card. The big Nevada casinos have put their money and considerable lobbying clout behind the bill to try to crush a competitive threat to their billion-dollar desert palaces.</p>
        <p>The bill's sponsor, Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, engineered the compromise with fellow Republicans to move the bill, which had stalled in a fight over the treatment of horse racing and state lotteries. The measure, similar to one passed by the Senate late last year, is scheduled to be debated on the House floor next week. The bill's backers say the chance for passage in the House appeared good.</p>
        <p>Sue Schneider, chairman of Interactive Gaming Council, said that should the bill become law it would be virtually unenforceable because technology was moving so rapidly and operators of Internet betting sites were more resourceful than would-be cyber cops. The answer is not an ill-conceived ban, Ms. Schneider, said, but legalization and regulation, as in 50 other countries.</p>
        <p>Proponents of the bill disagree. The measure would require Internet service providers, like America Online, to block access to gambling sites. But service providers would not be liable for failure to do so.  Compliance would be monitored by the Justice Department and state attorneys general.</p>
        <p>Gambling industry analysts say law enforcement agencies do not have the resources to keep up with what is fast becoming the world's largest floating crap game.</p>
        <p>The bill is supported by horse-racing interests, who successfully lobbied for an exemption from the bill's prohibition on computerized gambling. It would allow them to continue to build nationwide closed-circuit betting networks to compensate for declining attendance at racetracks.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the bill are well financed and aggressively represented as well. The opposition is led by the Interactive Gaming Council, an association of dozens of online betting parlors whose business has grown from virtually nothing five years ago to more than $1.2 billion in 1999. (By comparison, sales at Amazon.com, one of the Internet's biggest retailers, were $1.6 billion in 1999.)</p>
        <p>The bill is opposed as well by many governors, who see the Internet as an ideal way to increase lottery ticket sales. They are supported by technology firms, which lobbied unsuccessfully for the bill to allow computerized in-home lottery sales. One such firm, eLottery Inc., spent more than $200,000 lobbying on the issue in the last six months of 1999 alone.</p>
        <p>Some conservative groups oppose the bill because of the horse-racing exemption; libertarians object to government regulation of what they consider a private vice.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has not taken a formal position on the legislation, although the Justice Department objects to the horse-racing exemption. Vice President Al Gore opposes the bill, citing the horse-racing exemption and what he considers the unwarranted federal intrusion on freedom of commerce on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has no position on the bill, an aide said, although many of his colleagues have opposed it not only because of diminished lottery sales but also because they say it is as an infringement of states' rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodlatte's bill closely tracks the Senate bill sponsored by Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona. Senator Kyl's bill was passed by the Senate last November on a voice vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodlatte said he was surprised by the ferocity of the opposition in the House. He has spent the last several months refereeing fights between convenience store owners and state lottery commissioners, between the National Thoroughbred Racing Association and the online casino operators, between the Family Research Council (which supports the bill) and the Traditional Values Coalition (which opposes it).</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodlatte struck his deal on the bill with Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana. In addition to the exemption to betting on horses, the bill also exempts betting on greyhounds and jai alai. The horse-racing exemption, the bill's backers said, will not expand computerized betting because some types of computer-linked parimutuel  betting are already legal under horse-racing and interstate gambling laws passed in 1961 and 1978.</p>
        <p>''This bill does not legitimize any unlawful activity or expand the scope of otherwise lawful activity,'' Mr. Goodlatte said. ''It simply bans a great many forms of gambling on the Internet: sports betting, more than 700 cyber casinos and the sale of lottery tickets in people's homes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodlatte listed the groups supporting his effort, among them the National Association of Attorneys General, the National Council of Churches, Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Football League, Major League Baseball and the National Association of Convenience Stores.</p>
        <p>The convenience store operators support the bill because lottery tickets draw people to their stores, though they produce little profit. In-home lottery sales would cut into convenience store business and make it vastly easier for minors to gamble, said Marc Katz, vice president for government relations at the National Association of Convenience Stores.</p>
        <p>The Interactive Gaming Council, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, represents cyber casinos and sports books that operate from computer servers in the Caribbean, Britain's Channel Islands, Gibraltar and Australia.</p>
        <p>I.G.C. is represented in Washington by the lobbying firms Janus Merritt Strategies and podesta.com, run by Anthony Podesta, brother of John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff. In 1999, the internet gambling group paid its lobbyists more than $20,000 a month.</p>
        <p>Daniel Nestel, a lobbyist for the N.C.A.A., said that Internet gambling, particularly on sports, is growing exponentially and warned that Congress had to act soon. The major Nevada casinos are watching their business migrate to the offshore betting sites and are preparing to jump into the Internet unless Congress cracks down.</p>
