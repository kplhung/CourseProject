        <p>After a short public hearing, the Township Council here passed an ordinance banning the use of hand-held cell phones while driving, making Marlboro the first municipality in New Jersey, and one of six in the nation, to do so.</p>
        <p>But the ordinance, which would allow the use of hands-free or speaker phones, is likely to face court challenges from the cellular industry and from drivers who are ticketed.</p>
        <p>The vote by the council, where the ordinance was introduced by a 4-to-1 vote on June 22, came two days after  a similar law in Hilltown, Pa., was struck down by a judge who ruled it was ''pre-empted'' by the state's careless driving regulations.</p>
        <p>Philip J. Berg, who represented a motorist in the case, appeared at the hearing to argue that such laws are ''intrusive.''</p>
        <p>But arguing for the bill in one of the more emotional moments was Ed Goff, a 57-year-old retired pharmaceutical supervisor whose nephew was killed in September 1998 in an accident involving a cell phone.</p>
        <p>''Even one life is too many to give up for everyone else's pleasure and convenience,'' Mr. Goff said.</p>
        <p>After a unanimous vote by four council members (a councilman who opposed the measure was absent), Councilman Barry Denkensohn, the sponsor of the measure, said, ''Citizens look to the government for leadership, especially in the area of health and safety. When something is dangerous, we expect laws to be passed for our protection.'' A report by two researchers at the University of Toronto that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1997 found that drivers using cell phones  were four times more likely to be involved in an accident than those who were not.</p>
        <p>Challenging a common argument that hands-free phones are safer, they also reported that it was the conversation, not just the use of the phone, that distracted drivers.</p>
        <p>About 85 million Americans use cell phones, according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, a Washington-based trade group, which opposes legislation to regulate cell phone use.</p>
        <p>Tom Wheeler, the association's president, said laws to discourage distracted drivers already exist.  ''When you're behind the wheel, your focus should be on driving, and everything else, whether it's eating a hamburger, tuning a radio or making a call, is secondary,'' Mr. Wheeler said in an interview today.</p>
        <p>Bills to ban cell phones while driving were introduced in the New Jersey Senate and Assembly last year but failed to get out of committee. New Jersey is among 33 states, including New York and Connecticut, that have considered cell phone bans but have not passed them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver. Thirteen countries have bans of some sort.</p>
        <p>The first municipal ordinance -- enacted in Brooklyn, Ohio in March 1999 -- is still being enforced, said Maryjo Banish, assistant clerk to the Brooklyn City Council, in a telephone conversation today.</p>
        <p>James Berzok, spokesman for the State Department of Transportation, said he understood that Marlboro planned to send the ordinance to his agency for review.</p>
        <p>The Marlboro ordinance, which carries a $250 fine, would exempt police officers and other emergency service officials who are performing  their duties, drivers calling the police in an emergency and drivers who are parked out of the flow of traffic.</p>
