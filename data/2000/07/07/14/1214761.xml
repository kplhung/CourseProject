        <p>Editorial says Bill Bradley's endorsement is greatly needed by Vice Pres Al Gore, whose campaign for president has been strangely lethargic since Bradley's departure from the race</p>

        <p>The formal endorsement of Vice President Al Gore by former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey yesterday was predictable, but Mr. Gore had reason to savor it. Although the vice president defeated Mr. Bradley in every state primary early this year, his campaign since then has been strangely lethargic. The polls show Mr. Gore with only 70 percent support among Democrats, while Gov. George W. Bush has 90 percent support among Republicans. Though Mr. Bradley did poorly in the primary season, he might give Mr. Gore a lift among young people and independents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley's endorsement also marks a shift toward the convention season and the vice-presidential selections. As political theater, his performance at a boisterous rally in Wisconsin was far different from the awkward endorsement of Mr. Bush in May by Senator John McCain, who jokingly compared the exercise to taking medicine. In both cases, how Mr. McCain and Mr. Bradley handle themselves for the rest of the year will be watched by party professionals as a sign of whether either will be able to pick up the pieces and run again if their nominees are defeated in November.</p>

        <p>The formal endorsement of Vice President Al Gore by former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey yesterday was predictable, but Mr. Gore had reason to savor it. Although the vice president defeated Mr. Bradley in every state primary early this year, his campaign since then has been strangely lethargic. The polls show Mr. Gore with only 70 percent support among Democrats, while Gov. George W. Bush has 90 percent support among Republicans. Though Mr. Bradley did poorly in the primary season, he might give Mr. Gore a lift among young people and independents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley's endorsement also marks a shift toward the convention season and the vice-presidential selections. As political theater, his performance at a boisterous rally in Wisconsin was far different from the awkward endorsement of Mr. Bush in May by Senator John McCain, who jokingly compared the exercise to taking medicine. In both cases, how Mr. McCain and Mr. Bradley handle themselves for the rest of the year will be watched by party professionals as a sign of whether either will be able to pick up the pieces and run again if their nominees are defeated in November.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign was quick to try to recycle the former New Jersey senator's earlier criticism of Mr. Gore, particularly the charges that Mr. Gore was not telling the truth about his record. But there is a long history of challengers having to eat their words at convention time with little ill effect. It was Mr. Bush's father, after all, who had to live down his description of Ronald Reagan's tax-cut plans as ''voodoo economics.'' Both Mr. Bradley and Senator  McCain have ruled themselves out for the vice-presidential nominations of their parties, and there does not seem to be a rush to make them change their minds.</p>
        <p>Only two weeks before the opening of the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, speculation is rampant over Mr. Bush's choices. The governor said yesterday he had a short list. The guessing has centered on three governors -- Frank Keating of Oklahoma, George Pataki of New York and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania -- as well as Elizabeth Dole and Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. Mr. Pataki and Mr. Ridge are pro-choice Catholics who might stir up an unwelcome furor among anti-abortion forces at the convention.</p>
        <p>On the Democratic side, Mr. Gore is said to be looking closely at Senators Evan Bayh of Indiana and Bob Graham of Florida, as well as Gov. James Hunt of North Carolina. But because of the vice president's weak standing among the Democratic faithful, he is said to be considering the House minority leader, Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri. Some party insiders say Mr. Gephardt, more than anyone else, would put Missouri in the Democratic column and expand Mr. Gore's support generally within the Democratic base, especially in the industrial Midwest. But such thinking also highlights one of Mr. Gore's problems. At this point, he should be thinking of strategies for reaching beyond Democrats to independents and Republicans and not have to worry about support among Democrats.</p>
        <p>This has been a slow season for the campaign. But it is worth remembering that the primary elections were a time of unusually intense public interest. Our guess is that the conventions will reawaken the public's appetite for a combative fall campaign.</p>
