        <p>The House of Representatives has set the stage for a reprise of last year's battle over the financing of international family planning, narrowly voting today to maintain restrictions on the ability of private organizations that receive federal money to use their own money to provide abortions overseas.</p>
        <p>By a vote of 221 to 206, the House defeated an amendment to a $13.3 billion foreign aid bill that would have removed the restrictions. The limitations had been attached to the foreign aid measure last year as part of a one-year compromise worked out by the White House and Congressional Republicans to end a stalemate over the federal budget.</p>
        <p>The foreign aid bill for the next fiscal year was approved today by the House on a vote of 239 to 185 after lawmakers added money for indebted nations and anti-AIDS programs to the package of economic, military development measures. The total was $1.8 billion less than President Clinton had requested, and the measure faces a possible presidential veto on that basis.</p>
        <p>With the failure of the family-planning amendment, which was co-sponsored by Representatives Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York, and James C. Greenwood, Republican of Pennsylvania, the spotlight returns to the White House. President Clinton's advisers have said they will recommend, as they did last year, that he veto the measure, in part because of the restrictions.</p>
        <p>Both sides say that, like last year, the issue will loom large in the budget negotiations. And both sides agree that the only question is whether President Clinton will hold firm on a veto or whether, as he did last year, he will allow the restrictions to become law.</p>
        <p>Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Manhattan Democrat who supports abortion rights, sighed when asked whether she was confident that Mr. Clinton would adhere to his veto pledge.</p>
        <p>In measured tones, she said: ''I know the president doesn't want his legacy to be that this administration turned its back on the young women of the world. I believe the president will stand firm.''</p>
        <p>The restrictions affect groups that provide abortions in foreign countries, or lobby foreign governments on the issue, even if they use their own money for these activities. Current law prohibits the federal government from directly financing abortions in foreign countries. The rules were first enacted by President Ronald Reagan in an executive order in 1984. One of Mr. Clinton's first acts as president was to issue his own order rescinding the restrictions.</p>
        <p>Last year, during the crush of negotiations about spending bills, the Clinton administration permitted the restrictions to become law for one year. In return, Congressional Republicans agreed to legislation that began paying down the United States' debt to the United Nations.</p>
        <p>The compromise permitted Mr. Clinton to waive the restrictions, which he did. But in doing so he automatically invoked a provision in the law that cut federal money to all international family planning organizations by $12 million. The compromise also required that no more than $15 million in federal money could go to international family planning groups or their overseas subcontractors that refuse to abide by the limitations.</p>
        <p>Should the legislation stand, President Clinton could again waive the restrictions, but a consequence would be further cuts in family planning financing.</p>
        <p>Anti-abortion campaigners in Congress are seeking to extend the limits for another year, arguing that a precedent has been set. They say the cuts in family planning money last year did not result in many family planning groups refusing to accept American money for their services.</p>
        <p>''I think our position is much stronger now because all of the scare tactics that were put forward were totally unfounded,'' said Representative Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who is a leading abortion  opponent in the House. Indeed, during today's debate, Representative Jim Ryun, Republican of Kansas, said the House should ''honor the spirit of the compromise.'' The Senate foreign aid bill does not contain similar restrictions, but lawmakers say the issue will be among the last resolved resolved before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.</p>
        <p>Administration officials have assured abortion-rights advocates that Mr. Clinton intends to stand firm on vetoing any legislation that contains restrictions on the activities of international family planning organizations. But some advocates recall the President's reversal last year.</p>
        <p>''I was in a meeting with the chief of staff last year where he said under no circumstances would the president cave on this,'' said one abortion-rights supporter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''A few days later he did.''</p>
        <p>But some abortion rights advocates predicted that the administration's resolve would be strengthened by a need to keep faith with a core constituency in an election year.</p>
        <p>''It being a presidential election year, the advocates will direct their attention to the vice president and tell him it's time to keep the president's knees straight on this,'' Mr. Greenwood said.</p>
