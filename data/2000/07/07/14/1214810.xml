        <p>Remaining remarkably true to the first principles of his art, the sculptor John Chamberlain, now 73 and having his 32nd New York gallery show, provides an active precedent for the street-savvy, wisecracking formalism favored by numerous younger artists these days. His work has often been characterized as a three-dimensional Abstract Expressionism, but abstracted Pop Art seems just as appropriate. His preferred material remains the fragments of discarded car bodies that he has used since the early 1960's, crushed and folded in upon themselves. These flamboyantly ''abstract'' works blur the distinctions between solid and void, found and formal, accident and plan.</p>
        <p>Over the last three decades Mr. Chamberlain has worked many variations on this basic equation, but he has always moved toward more aggressive manipulations of form and color, and away from crashed-car recognizability. He has, for example, been adding color to the found car parts since the late 1970's, dripping, spraying and patterning on top of existing hues to often wild effect and has also taken to cutting his car parts into long ribbons, which he leaves unfurled, crumples into undulating bands or rolls into dense rosettes.</p>

        <p>Remaining remarkably true to the first principles of his art, the sculptor John Chamberlain, now 73 and having his 32nd New York gallery show, provides an active precedent for the street-savvy, wisecracking formalism favored by numerous younger artists these days. His work has often been characterized as a three-dimensional Abstract Expressionism, but abstracted Pop Art seems just as appropriate. His preferred material remains the fragments of discarded car bodies that he has used since the early 1960's, crushed and folded in upon themselves. These flamboyantly ''abstract'' works blur the distinctions between solid and void, found and formal, accident and plan.</p>
        <p>Over the last three decades Mr. Chamberlain has worked many variations on this basic equation, but he has always moved toward more aggressive manipulations of form and color, and away from crashed-car recognizability. He has, for example, been adding color to the found car parts since the late 1970's, dripping, spraying and patterning on top of existing hues to often wild effect and has also taken to cutting his car parts into long ribbons, which he leaves unfurled, crumples into undulating bands or rolls into dense rosettes.</p>
        <p>Lately he has also started doing all the painting himself and, with a brush, applying thick layers and stripes of enamel to the bare, uncrumpled metal. The colors in his latest show, especially in three works from this year, are hot and juicy. The ribbons, arranged in dense, boxy compositions, suggest peelings or shavings of pure color, while unpainted surfaces are chromed and shiny. The resulting  sensuousness and weight is more new-car than old, a shift and variation that shows him once more doing the same thing, only differently, and very much at the top of his game.</p>
