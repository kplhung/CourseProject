        <p>Reflecting the continued tensions between Congress and the District of Columbia, House Republicans are angry about a proposed city ordinance requiring insurance companies to cover prescription contraceptives routinely and plan to try to overturn it.</p>
        <p>Influential Republicans and some Democrats in the House said today that the city government's failure to exempt religious organizations with doctrinal objections to providing contraceptive benefits to their workers threatened the good will that had been built up between the city and Congress.</p>
        <p>Angered by the lack of an exemption, or ''conscience clause,'' for church-based employers and by what he termed anti-Catholic comments of several council members, Representative Ernest Istook, an Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee that appropriates money for the District, has drafted legislation that would overturn the ordinance.</p>
        <p>''Not only did they not put in place a conscience clause, but there was a very ugly situation regarding comments from some people,'' Mr. Istook said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Istook and other Republicans singled out the comments of Jim Graham, one of two openly gay members of the city council who, during debate on the measure, angrily took issue with recent statements by Pope John Paul II that castigated homosexuals.</p>
        <p>In a message delivered last Sunday in Rome, the Pope said that the ''homosexual acts go against natural law'' and that it was an ''objectively disordered'' inclination. The pontiff did add that homosexuals should be treated with ''respect, compassion and sensitivity.''</p>
        <p>Church groups, including the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, had lobbied heavily for a broad exemption from the ordinance, asking that not only purely religious organizations be exempted but that institutions like Georgetown University, with a largely secular purpose, also be excluded.</p>
        <p>To date 13 states require insurance companies that pay for prescriptions to also pay for at least some prescription contraceptives. Of those states, nine exempt religious organizations from the requirement.</p>
        <p>''My problem is surrendering decisions on public health matters to the church,'' Mr. Graham said at a council meeting Monday night as he waved a newspaper clip containing the Pope's comment. ''I've spent years fighting church dogma.''</p>
        <p>The city council member went on to criticize the Catholic Church for its opposition to the distribution of condoms in the 1980's, an action he said helped foster the spread of AIDS.</p>
        <p>Later during the Monday meeting the council approved the measure. To become law it must be signed by Mayor Anthony A. Williams, who has not yet said how he will act on it.</p>
        <p>Catholic leaders, who said they were disappointed by Mr. Graham's comments, argued that they should receive a broad exemption from the ordinance because many functions that seem secular are central to what the church is about.</p>
        <p>''The church's mission is not merely to promote religious beliefs, but has always been involved in education, and health care and social services,'' said William E. Lori, the auxilary bishop of Washington. ''All of these are integral to our mission as a church. And the government shouldn't tell us which of our Catholic institutions can follow Catholic principles and which ones cannot.''</p>
        <p>Allies of Mr. Graham said he was not anti-Catholic but was expressing frustration over both the views expressed by the Pope and the lobbying efforts of local Catholic leaders to avoid being covered by the ordinance.</p>
        <p>''He had just read some very intolerant views from the Pope on gays, and then had the bishops come in and say, hey, cut us some slack on this law,'' said Brian Bond, president of the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, a group that helps openly homosexual candidates win public office.</p>
        <p>Some Congressional Democrats complained that the Republicans were making the municipal law an issue to regain the party's appeal to Catholics who might have been upset by the visit of Gov. George W. Bush to Bob Jones University, as well as the House leadership's initial objection to the appointment of the first Catholic to be chaplain of the House.</p>
        <p>As if to confirm those suspicions, Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, head of the National Republican Campaign Committee, noted in an interview how much he objected to the allegedly anti-Catholic comments made by Mr. Graham, who is a Democrat.</p>
        <p>''After all the anti-Catholic stuff the Democrats have been hurling at Republicans, for Jim Graham to get up and say what he did about the Pope was very unfortunate,'' Mr. Davis said.</p>
