        <p>The Tour de France has finished a daily stage atop the barren Mont Ventoux six times in its 97-year history and some of bicycle racing's strongest climbers have won there: Eddy Merckx, Raymond Poulidor and Charly Gaul, among them.

        <p>The Tour de France has finished a daily stage atop the barren Mont Ventoux six times in its 97-year history and some of bicycle racing's strongest climbers have won there: Eddy Merckx, Raymond Poulidor and Charly Gaul, among them. Today, Marco Pantani of Italy added his name to the short list.</p>
        <p>Pantani, who attacked a small group of climbers four times on the way up, won with a gracious assist from Lance Armstrong of the United States, who allowed the Italian to pass him at the finish line without a fight. With Armstrong setting the pace for the last 2 steep kilometers (1.24 miles), the pair opened a lead of nearly half a minute over a few chasers, including Jan Ullrich, the German who is second over all behind Armstrong.</p>
        <p>''I didn't need to attack,'' Armstrong, leader of the U.S. Postal Service team, said, speaking of his sudden acceleration with nearly 3 kilometers left in the 149-kilometer (92.6-mile) 12th stage. ''I took the opportunity because Ullrich was there and he's my top rival. It's not important to win the stage. It's more important to win in Paris.'' The three-week Tour ends in Paris July 23.</p>
        <p>Armstrong acknowledged that he had not contested Pantani's final surge: ''In the minds of many people, he's the greatest climber in the world. He deserved to win here.''</p>
        <p>Pantani acknowledged it too, calling the Texan exceptional. ''He's a great champion,'' said the Mercatone Uno rider, the winner of the 1998 Tour. Great champions, especially Miguel Indurain, who won five consecutive Tours last decade and who is an idol to Armstrong, have occasionally let a companion in a long attack win at the line while they consolidated their lead.</p>
        <p>With the second-place bonus of 12 seconds deducted from his overall time and the 29 seconds he finished ahead of Ullrich, who finished fourth today, Armstrong widened his lead to 4 minutes 55 seconds.</p>
        <p>Pantani and Armstrong were clocked in 4:15:11, a speed of 35 kilometers an hour (21.7 m.p.h.) into a mistral wind blowing over their shoulders from the front. The stage, which started in Carpentras in sunny and moderately warm weather, finished with the same sun but temperatures in the 40's Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>''The wind was the hardest part,'' Armstrong said. The world record for wind was set atop Mont Ventoux in February 1967, when gusts reached 320 k.p.h. (almost 200 m.p.h.). That was a south wind, not the mistral from the north. After a heavy blow Wednesday, a day off in the race, the mistral lost some of its steam today.</p>
        <p>For Pantani, the victory was his first in more than a year. After he failed a blood test that indicated the use of illegal drugs, he was expelled from the Giro d'Italia, the world's second-ranked race, in June 1999. He was then two days from the finish and on his way to easy victory.</p>
        <p>Humiliated and crushed psychologically, the Italian retired from racing until this spring. He competed for two days then in a minor race in Spain before withdrawing into solitude again. Late in May, he entered the Giro at the last moment and showed his rustiness despite a strong showing on just one of many mountain stages, where he formerly danced away from the pack.</p>
        <p>His lack of competition has been evident in the Tour, where he ranked 24th, more than 10 1/2 minutes behind Armstrong, at the start today. He now ranks 12th.</p>
        <p>Left behind early in the 21-kilometer (13-mile) ascension of the Ventoux, Pantani fought back. When he rejoined the leaders, he tried four times to bolt away from them. He was caught each time, but remained strong. When Armstrong made the decisive attack, only Pantani could stay with him.</p>
        <p>As they neared the top, passing the memorial to Tom Simpson, Armstrong was still doing all the work at the front, continually glancing over his shoulder to see if he had left his rival behind. He hadn't and didn't.</p>
        <p>As usual in a bicycle race on the Ventoux, honor was paid beforehand to Simpson, the Briton who was world road race champion in 1965 and the winner of many esteemed one-day classics in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>Simpson was just short of his 30th birthday in 1967 when he began the 13th stage of the Tour in blazing heat. Determined to win a race in which he had never finished higher than sixth, the rider had slid in the Alps to seventh place over all. The Briton attacked early on the Ventoux, fell back, struggled upward past the tree line, weaved across the road and then fell. He was clearly exhausted and workers for his team begged him to quit.</p>
        <p>''No, put me back on my bike,'' Simpson said. ''I must go on.''</p>
        <p>He rode 200 meters more and then collapsed. Taken by helicopter to a hospital in nearby Avignon, he was pronounced dead.</p>
