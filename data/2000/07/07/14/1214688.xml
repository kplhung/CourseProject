      <block class="full_text">
        <p>It feels like a dream.</p>
        <p>You alight on an island, not knowing what awaits you, not quite sure what you are supposed to do there.</p>
        <p>An overgrown concrete path pulls you past riotous sea roses to mysterious ruins, pillars reaching for the open sky like a small Temple of Luxor, only smothered in tangled trees.</p>
        <p>Or a freshly mown trail of sweet grass leads you up and over a wooded hill to a deserted beach strewn with mussel shells and driftwood and Dadaist detritus: a glove, another glove from a different pair, a shoe, a soda bottle, a fish skeleton the size of an oven mitt.</p>
        <p>Or you wander into an imposing granite fort, walls four feet thick, that is riddled with winding staircases that take you from the light into the dark, some leading up to old cannon emplacements and sea air, some leading to black dead ends.</p>
        <p>And here is the strangest part of all: you haven't even left Boston.</p>
        <p>You have simply left the overtrodden path of the Freedom Trail and the other usual sights for one of the city's oldest and newest attractions: the islands of Boston Harbor.</p>
        <p>The islands are so little known that most guidebooks barely mention them, and it never occurs to most Bostonians to visit them, unless they are sixth graders on a class trip to the historic fort on George's Island.</p>
        <p>But heroic, if still slightly confused, efforts are under way to transform the 30 islands, which became part of the national park system in 1996, into recreation spots the public will actually use, now that the harbor has changed from one of the country's dirtiest to one of its cleanest. There is talk of a ''poor man's Nantucket,'' and of plans to increase the annual flow of visitors to the islands to 500,000 from 100,000.</p>
        <p>And though much is still a work in progress, the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area already offers a fine weekend's worth of exploration, from the ruins on Bumpkin Island to the well-trafficked fort on George's, even to overnight camping on the well-mown sites of Grape Island.</p>
        <p>The rate of the progress can be a bit frustrating: there have been some loud complaints in Boston in recent days that more islands have not been opened for public viewing of the Tall Ships, which paraded in on Tuesday and are to leave by next Friday. And descriptions of which islands are open and what programs they offer, as printed in brochures and posted on the islands' Web site, www.bostonislands.com, need careful checking by telephone before serious planning begins.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, who knows? Perhaps the islands, which range in size from less than an acre to more than 250, will be overrun with visitors when the park finally gets its act together. And considering the complex partnerships that run the islands, with players ranging from the city to the state to the federal government to environmentalists to island advocates, it is rather amazing that anything has been done at all.</p>
        <p>Here, then, is an up-to-the-minute description of two ways to do the islands as they are. The tame way: take the ferry to George's Island and go by water taxi to the others. The wilder way: kayak to Grape Island, where you can camp overnight and explore the surrounding waters.</p>
        <p>An Easy Ferry Ride</p>
        <p>The tame way does not seem quite so tame if you are 7 years old, like Nathan Robinson, whose parents kindly volunteered him as a child trip-tester, or 5, like his sister, Nellie. As the ferry that leaves Long Wharf in downtown Boston every hour on the hour steamed out into the harbor, Nathan wore a smile as broad as the horizon. ''I can't believe I'm really going to an island!'' he exclaimed as his elders hummed the theme to ''Gilligan's Island.''</p>
        <p>The bellies of planes zooming in to land at Logan Airport, just across the harbor, seemed to loom just a few feet above the ferry. We passed the hotels and the exhibition center of the Seaport District and, a few minutes later, the twin mounds of Spectacle Island, a former giant dump that has been capped with dirt from Boston's Big Dig highway project and landscaped into a park. It is not yet open to the public, to the chagrin of boaters who would like to watch the Tall Ships from there.</p>
        <p>In 45 minutes, we had arrived at George's Island, a 28-acre chunk of land that holds Fort Warren, a 19th-century bastion built around a great pentagonal swath of lawn and offering sweeping harbor views from its ramparts. Its house-size powder magazine is empty now, a dark hall of echoes, but on the ramparts, there are still the remains of the emplacements that once held guns so big that they had a range of eight miles. The fort never saw actual battle, but during the Civil War it was used as a prison for Confederate soldiers and was long seen as pivotal in the sea defense of Boston.</p>
        <p>These days it is a place for picnics and baseball and knit-browed contemplation of the quirky course of history. For an hour or so, we wandered up and down the staircases, looked out from a viewing tower over nearby islands and the elongated stretch of skyscrapers that is the Boston cityscape and poked our heads into thick-walled rooms with nothing in them.</p>
        <p>Then Nathan and Nellie decided it was time to head for the snack bar, which, late on a weekend afternoon, had nothing to offer but cornbread and candy bars. When going to any of the islands, visitors are well advised to bring their own food and particularly their own drinks: most of the islands lack water.</p>
        <p>Theoretically, there are supposed to be water taxis -- free shuttle boats -- from George's Island to five others. In fact, in late June, the park was offering shuttles to only two, Grape and Bumpkin. Since those islands were on our schedule for the wilder harbor trip, we contented ourselves with cornbread and a crowded ride back to Long Wharf, where the charge for parking two cars -- $24 each in the garage at the wharf -- far outdid the price of the ferry tickets, $8 round-trip for adults and $6 for children.</p>
        <p>Asked to rate the trip from 1 to 10, Nathan and Nellie gave it a solid 8; both said the best thing about it was the ferry ride.</p>
        <p>A Hard but Happy Way</p>
        <p>On the wilder tour of the harbor, it was the ride, too, that was the most fun. But because it was a water road less traveled by, its logistics were more complex.</p>
        <p>Stephen Lines, my dauntless photographer friend, and I decided to camp on Grape Island -- not because that was the island we really wanted to camp on, but because, whatever the brochures might have said about the availability of camping on three harbor islands, this was the only one actually open for camping in June. (Less law-abiding folks just forgo the required permits and camp on various islands.)</p>
        <p>Asked what the problem was with the other islands, park officials plunged into tales of pier damage and political complexity. Whatever. There were no reservations left for campsites on Grape Island, but we were told that people often failed to show up, and, in fact, when we decided to risk it anyway, we found about half of the dozen or so campsites empty.</p>
        <p>Grape Island can be reached by ferry, but oh-h-h, no, that would be much too easy, so we decided to kayak there, a small jump of a paddle out of the town of Hingham, southeast of Boston. Eastern Mountain Sports in Hingham, just a mile or so from the ferry terminal, rents kayaks by the hour, day or weekend.</p>
        <p>After a pleasant stroll into World's End, a peaceful, marshy peninsula that is officially part of the national park, we drove to the gigantic parking lot for the commuter ferries that link Hingham to Boston and found a good ramp into the water for our boats next to the South Shore Lobster building. From there, as night was falling, it was less than a mile's paddle in protected, though heavily trafficked, waters to Grape. For some reason, although Eastern Mountain Sports rents boats, paddles and life preservers, it refused to rent us spray skirts, so the ride was wet. I improvised by covering my knees with my jacket.</p>
        <p>The truth is, if you came upon the 50 acres of Grape Island in some suburb, you would be underwhelmed. It would seem like just a small stretch of charming, hilly farmland. But because it is surrounded by water, its bayberry smells are all the sweeter, its hills afford the most astonishing of views, and the small grape arbor that stands near the ferry dock seems to be welcoming visitors into a world with a touch of magic -- one that feels very ''away.''</p>
        <p>An entry in the guest book hanging at the arbor read, ''Hidden treasure so near the city.''</p>
        <p>The outhouse near the campsites was locked, but the sites themselves were grassy and private, each with a picnic table and enough woods around them to make the lack of an outhouse not too big a problem. Note: mosquitoes can apparently take the ferry free.</p>
        <p>The next day, the 10 a.m. ferry disgorged just three people: a couple with lawn chairs and a man who must have been a birder because he kept standing around, sharp-eyed.</p>
        <p>On a Path to Surprises</p>
        <p>After wandering the beach a bit, we set out for Bumpkin Island. (Well, all right, I thought it was Peddock's Island, but that's what comes of having no sense of direction and consulting a harbor map that says right on it that it should not be used for navigational purposes.) It was a bit of a rough paddle, in wind and waves, which made the shores of Bumpkin look all the more inviting.</p>
        <p>Bumpkin Island has a fancy-looking pier, but the park managers had said it was not open yet, and there was no one else on the island but a motorboating family. From the pier, a concrete path lined by salt-spray rose bushes (who, you wonder, lugged all that concrete here?) leads off around the island and up to the ruins of a children's hospital that burned down in 1945, its roofless pillars now swamped in a jungle of trees. It seems a pity to tell you that, though; so much of the fun comes from following a path without knowing where it leads. So I've purposely left out another interesting ruin that you will come upon if you ever take that Bumpkin Island path.</p>
        <p>Like the other islands, Bumpkin offers a strong sense of history -- physical reminders that though it seems like nowhere now, it used to be a much busier place that seemed closer to the city. Many of the islands were popular spots from Indian days and well into the Colonial era. On Bumpkin, there is the hospital ruin; Gallop's Island used to have a resort and an immigration station. Spectacle Island used to have houses of ill repute and a horse-rendering factory. Lovell's has the remains of a fort used during the Spanish-American war, and Peddock's has the remains of a fort, too.</p>
        <p>Where History Shines</p>
        <p>These summer days, the islands offer a plethora of programs as well, from guided walks to narrated boat rides, with plenty of chances to practice the Bostonian habit of learning history until it is coming out of your ears.</p>
        <p>But the historic spot of all historic spots in the harbor is Little Brewster Island, site of Boston Light, billed as the oldest continuously staffed lighthouse in the country. No regular ferries go to Little Brewster, but there are weekend tours leaving from Fan Pier and Friday tours from the John F. Kennedy Library in the Dorchester section of Boston.</p>
        <p>It was only a little jaunt, this trip of maybe five nautical miles from Hingham to Grape Island to Bumpkin and back to Hingham, but the wonder of it was that it did feel like a full-fledged outdoor adventure, one undertaken without ever leaving metropolitan Boston. No other major city, island boosters here say, has such an array of islands so very close to its shores. It is, to steal their phrase, a veritable urban archipelago.</p>
        <p>But an urban archipelago without batter-dipped shellfish. Leaving Hingham, we stopped at the Hingham Lobster Pound, where the paper buckets of fried clams served as happy reminders that there will always be certain inimitable advantages to life on the mainland.</p>
        <p>Doing the Tour</p>
        <p>The Boston harbor islands are 215 miles northeast of New York City. Here are some attractions as well as travel information.</p>
