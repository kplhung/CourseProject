        <p>MANHATTAN: GIULIANI AIDE RESIGNS  Richard T. Roberts, a top New York City housing official and one of a few high-ranking African-Americans in the Giuliani administration, announced yesterday that he was resigning to take a job at Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment firm. Mr. Roberts served three years as commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which helps finance and develop low- and moderate-cost housing in New York City. The department's budget has declined significantly during the Giuliani administration. But the mayor said yesterday that during Mr. Roberts' tenure, more than 40,000 housing units were built or renovated with private and public funds.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: QUARTER DESIGN CHOSEN  The Statue of Liberty edged out the Battle of Saratoga as the design for New York's commemorative quarter, Gov. George Pataki announced yesterday. The new quarter will feature the statue and the words ''Gateway to Freedom'' against an outline of New York State. All 50 states are getting a special quarter as part of a decadelong program to mark each state's entrance into the union.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: DEAD WOMAN FOUND  The body of an unidentified woman who had been stabbed was found early yesterday in a recycling plant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The police said they did not think her killing was linked to the deaths of six other women, all of whom they believe may have been killed by the same person. Workers at the plant at 130 Varick Street near the Manhattan Bridge found the body just before 8 a.m. as they were sorting through recyclable materials. Detectives said the woman's wounds were not similar to those in the earlier cases.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: STATEWIDE SCHOOL STANDARDS  A new plan to rank New York State's public schools will eventually require 90 percent of a school's students to meet state standards, education officials announced yesterday. Under the plan, adopted in May, every school in the state will be publicly graded based on scores on the new statewide tests. Schools will fall into one of three categories: meeting standards, below standards and farthest from standards. State education officials said the long-term goal was for 90 percent of each elementary and middle school's students to reach at least Level 3 on standardized tests in mathematics and English. (Tests are scored from Level 1 to Level 4, the highest.)</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: CORRECTIONS UNION BACKS BUSH  The Correction Officers' Benevolent Association of New York has become one of the first unions to endorse Gov. George W. Bush's run for the presidency. Norman Seabrook, president of the 11,000-member union that represents workers at New York City jails, said the union's board voted this week to support the presumptive Republican candidate ''because he is a Republican that has shown his willingness to sit down with anyone and talk about the issues that concern the nation.''

        <p>MANHATTAN: SENTENCE REDUCTION URGED  The lawyer for Justin A. Volpe, the former police officer sentenced to 30 years in prison for brutalizing a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, with a broomstick, argued yesterday that the sentence was too harsh. The lawyer, Alan J. Chaset, argued at a hearing in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that Judge Eugene H. Nickerson should have imposed a lighter sentence by taking into account Mr. Volpe's eventual confession to violating Mr. Louima's civil rights. The lawyer is seeking to have Mr. Volpe's sentence cut in half.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: DISABLED MAN SUES POLICE  A 23-year-old man with a prosthetic right leg filed a state civil rights petition yesterday, seeking to force the Police Department to allow him to take its pre-admissions agility test. The man, Brian O'Sullivan, says he is a skier, jogger, weightlifter and swimmer and therefore capable of working in uniform. He says he is also a brother, son and grandson of police officers. His lawyer, Brian O'Dwyer, said his client ''just wants to be given the same opportunity as anybody else.''</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: TAVERN OWNER PLEADS  The owner of the Minetta Tavern, a former speakeasy in Greenwich Village that was once popular with many Beat Generation writers, pleaded guilty yesterday to conspiring to smuggle the illegal drug Ecstasy into the country. Joseph Colgan, 33, admitted in Federal District Court in Brooklyn to the drug conspiracy, which the government claims resulted in the illegal importation of more than 80,000 Ecstasy tablets from the Netherlands over five months last year.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: NEW TRASH RULES URGED  Accusing Connecticut's trash collectors of engaging in ''suspect practices'' for years, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal called for the state to begin regulating the hauling agency. The announcement Wednesday came after more than a thousand tons of trash was illegally dumped by Sanitary Services, a hauling company, in Manchester last month. Mr. Blumenthal's proposal, which he plans to bring to the Legislature, would require trash haulers to undergo extensive background checks before obtaining a license and to obtain insurance to cover environmental damage.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>NEWARK: POLICE SHOOTING  Federal prosecutors said yesterday that there was insufficient evidence to file civil rights charges against four police officers who fired 25 shots into the car of a black man last year after a chase on Interstate 80 in Morris County. The man, Stanton Lamont Crew, 31, died. Yesterday's conclusion by the Justice Department and the United States attorney's office here followed a Morris County grand jury's refusal to indict the officers in December. Official accounts of the June 2, 1999, incident said Mr. Crew had endangered the officers when he tried to drive away even after his car was surrounded by state and local police cruisers.</p>
