        <p>''It's the Rage,'' which opens today at Cinema Village, begins with gunshots as a suburban homeowner (Jeff Daniels) accidentally shoots an intruder who turns out to be the business partner he has suspected of cuckolding him. From this promising film noir beginning, James D.

        <p>Each of the nine characters whose fates entwine in the manner of a limping homage to Robert Altman is the victim or the perpetrator of an act of gun violence, or sometimes both. ''It's the Rage,'' based on a play by Keith Reddin, who also wrote the screenplay, purports to be a darkly comic look at our national obsession with firearms, a satire of their seductive power and an expose of the harm they do. But it's more like a ham-fisted high-concept public service announcement, directed with stagy deliberateness and written with tin-eared vernacular speechiness. Guns are bad, kids, and if you can stay awake, you'll understand why.</p>

        <p>''It's the Rage,'' which opens today at Cinema Village, begins with gunshots as a suburban homeowner (Jeff Daniels) accidentally shoots an intruder who turns out to be the business partner he has suspected of cuckolding him. From this promising film noir beginning, James D. Stern's debut feature quickly -- or rather, slowly, since the pacing is that of a long, talky evening of repertory theater -- becomes an excruciatingly literal-minded, floridly literary application of Chekhov's dictum that a gun on the mantelpiece in the first act of a play must be fired by the end.</p>
        <p>Each of the nine characters whose fates entwine in the manner of a limping homage to Robert Altman is the victim or the perpetrator of an act of gun violence, or sometimes both. ''It's the Rage,'' based on a play by Keith Reddin, who also wrote the screenplay, purports to be a darkly comic look at our national obsession with firearms, a satire of their seductive power and an expose of the harm they do. But it's more like a ham-fisted high-concept public service announcement, directed with stagy deliberateness and written with tin-eared vernacular speechiness. Guns are bad, kids, and if you can stay awake, you'll understand why.</p>
        <p>No doubt the high-mindedness of the project attracted its impressive cast, one of the densest concentrations of Oscar winners and nominees ever assembled for a noble bad movie. Some fare better than others. Joan Allen as a repressed housewife who flees her husband's murderous jealousy is, as ever, the picture of understated, suffering poise.</p>
        <p>But Gary Sinise, as the reclusive computer genius with whom she takes refuge, is all shtick in Coke-bottle glasses and ratty nerd clothes.  Anna Paquin as some kind of bleached-blond hip-hop shoplifter is outdone in her pointless emoting only by Giovanni Ribisi as her hopped-up hoodlum brother, who dresses in vintage Sid Vicious fashions and looks, at one point, as if he might gnaw through the chassis of a Lincoln Town Car just to vent his rage.</p>
        <p>The television actors do a bit better: David Schwimmer (Ross from ''Friends'') and Andre Braugher (Pembleton from ''Homicide'') shake loose their NBC personas in their portrayal of a gay couple riven by jealousy and undone by the inevitable and implausible outbreak of gunfire that pulls the movie to its conclusion. ''It's the Rage'' does offer the dubious pleasure of watching superb actors read terrible lines with evident conviction and impersonate characters untethered to any known human reality. This wouldn't be fatal if the film didn't festoon its literary posturing and its contrived ''Columbo''-style narrative with the trappings of political relevance. At the end, a Cheryl Wheeler song announces that ''if it were up to me, I'd take away the guns.'' A fine sentiment, but one that comes almost two hours too late.</p>
        <p>''It's the Rage'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and violence.</p>
