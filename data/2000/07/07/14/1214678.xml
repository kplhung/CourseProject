        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>GLIMMERGLASS OPERA. This summer is the 25th anniversary of the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., and the weekend offers one of the world's most popular operas, Puccini's ''Boheme,'' directed by James Robinson and conducted by Stewart Robertson, and a rarity, John Philip Sousa's operetta ''The Glass Blowers'' (later called ''The American Maid''). This would appear to be the first performance of the complete Sousa work since its 1913 premiere. A new edition based on original sources has been prepared by Jerrold Fisher and William Martin. And running throughout the frothy score is, not surprisingly, a rousing march tune that keeps turning up in different guises. Christopher Alden is the director and John DeMain, making his Glimmerglass debut, will conduct. ''La Boheme'': tomorrow at 8 p.m. ''The Glass Blowers'': Sunday at 2 p.m. Glimmerglass Opera, Alice Busch Theater, on Route 80, eight miles north of Cooperstown, N.Y. Tickets: $22 to $90; discounts of 10 percent for students and the elderly, and 50 percent for those under 18.  Information and tickets: (607) 547-2255. (Anthony Tommasini).</p>

        <p>''SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR.'' The Opera Festival of New Jersey's production of Hugo Weisgall's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author'' should help this important 1956 opera gain the honored place in the repertory it deserves. Like the play by Pirandello on which it is based, this haunting work shatters the boundaries between illusion and reality. Despite a few miscalculations, the Opera Festival's starkly realistic production is quite effective. The musical performance, conducted by Barbara Day Turner, already admirable, should only grow stronger. Standouts in the cast include Michaela Gurevich, Robert Orth and the ageless Rosalind Elias. This weekend the Opera Festival also presents Bizet's ''Carmen,'' starring Suzanna Guzman, and Verdi's ''Falstaff,'' with Mark Delavan in the title role. McCarter Theater, 91 University Place, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J. ''Carmen,'' tonight at 8; ''Falstaff,'' tomorrow at 8 p.m.; ''Six Characters in Search of an Author,'' Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $24 to $82. Tickets, information and directions: (609) 258-2787 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''WRITING TO VERMEER.'' Louis Andriessen's beautiful score and Peter Greenaway's extravagant staging do their separate takes on the small, quiet art of a great Dutch painter. The libretto, in English, is in the form of letters from his household to the absent artist. There is a parade of vivid visual effects accompanied by great amounts of water and other liquids. The end is a downpour. The opera itself is interesting, though the spirit of Vermeer himself is pretty much left to drown. But then there is Mr. Andriessen's deft and lyrical music. Reinbert de Leeuw conducts. Lincoln Center Festival, the New York State Theater, tonight and tomorrow night at 8, (212) 875-5928. Tickets: $20 to $85. (Bernard Holland).</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>ASTON MAGNA. The early-music scene in the Northeast has long shifted between New York and Boston, and what better middle ground is there in the summer than the Berkshire Hills? (Just ask the Boston Symphony Orchestra and New York listeners, who meet annually at Tanglewood.) This weekend the Aston Magna festival offers a program of Schubert on period instruments, featuring the ''Trout'' Quintet. Daniel Stepner, a violinist and the artistic director, is joined by John Gibbons, pianist; David Miller, violist; Loretta O'Sullivan, cellist, and Anne Trout (yes, so the announcement says), double bassist. Tomorrow night at 6, St. James Church, off Main Street, Great Barrington, Mass., (413) 528-3595. Tickets: $20 at the door; $18.50 in advance; $16 for students and the elderly. The program is also to be presented tonight at 8 at Bard College, Route 9G, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (914) 758-7425. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and the elderly (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. Winter or summer, there are few better places in the city to hear chamber music than this barge floating on the East River, with its live, intimate acoustics and its spectacular view of Lower Manhattan. Good weather will only enhance the experience, and the performances are often as fine as the setting. Here are contrasting programs, coordinated by Carmit Zori, a violinist. Tonight and tomorrow, Ms. Zori is to be joined by Stephanie Brown, a pianist, and Sally Pendlebury, a cellist, in works by Haydn, Schubert and Brahms. On Sunday, Ms. Zori will be joined by Robert Wolinsky, a harpsichordist; Douglas Boyd, an oboist; and others in a program of Bach (J. S., mostly, with a sonata by C. P. E.). Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, and Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $27; $25 for the elderly; $15 for students (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>CARAMOOR FESTIVAL. The site of the Caramoor Festival, a 110-acre estate with lush grounds and gardens in Katonah, N.Y., is as much a draw as its varied concert offerings. Picnicking on the lawns before concerts is a Caramoor tradition. The dynamic new-music ensemble ''Eighth Blackbird'' presents a concert of works by Kenneth Eberhard, Arturo Salinas, Donald Martino, George Crumb and Carlos Sanchez-Gutierrez tonight. Tomorrow Donald Runnicles will conduct the Orchestra of St. Luke's in Stravinsky's ''Dumbarton Oaks'' Concerto, the Schumann Piano Concerto (with Helene Grimaud as soloist) and Beethoven's ''Eroica'' Symphony. On Sunday Ms. Grimaud joins the Shanghai Quartet, the Bachmann-Klibonoff-Fridman Trio and other artists for a Brahms and Schumann chamber music program. Eighth Blackbird: tonight at 8, the Spanish Courtyard. Tickets: $25. Orchestra of St. Luke's: tomorrow at 8:30, the Venetian Theater. Tickets: $15 to $55. Schumann-Brahms Chamber Music Concert: Sunday at 4 p.m., the Venetian Theater. Tickets: $25 and $35. Caramoor Festival, Katonah, N.Y. Tickets and directions: (914) 232-5035 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>ELECTRONIC EVOLUTION. Lincoln Center Festival 2000 is offering a fascinating five-part series of concerts to explore the whole range of electronic music, from the early days in the 1940's, when what were then thought to be sophisticated tape recorders produced electronically altered montages of real sounds (musical instruments, voices, noises of all kinds) to the present, when computer technology seems limitless in its possibilities. Of course, before we know it, current technology may seem as dated as those boxy 1940's tape recorders. But however sophisticated the technology, it's the music that has come from these techniques that matters, and the third and fourth concerts in the series offer lots of it. A program tonight, ''Masterpieces of 20th-Century Multi-Channel Tape Music,'' produced by the Columbia University Music Center, offers works by Varese, Stockhausen, Xenakis and others. Tomorrow night, a program at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, intriguingly called ''The Turntable as an Ensemble Instrument,'' offers works by Cage and premieres by Raz Mesinai and the X-ecutioners. The doors open for tonight's program at 7, so that people may wander through interactive displays of electronic music sources.  ''Masterpieces of 20th-Century Multi-Channel Tape Music,'' tonight at 9, Low Library Rotunda, Columbia University; doors open at 7 p.m. for interactive displays. Tickets: $15. ''The Turntable as an Ensemble Instrument,'' tomorrow at 9 p.m., New York Society for Ethical Culture, 64th Street and Central Park West. Tickets: $20. Information and charging tickets: (212) 721-6500 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>INTERNATIONAL KEYBOARD INSTITUTE AND FESTIVAL. The pianist Jerome Rose took a chance when he became the founder and director of the International Keyboard Institute and Festival, a two-week examination of the art of the piano, with concerts, master classes, panels and lectures, sponsored by the Mannes College of Music. But the institute was a considerable success and is being repeated this summer, running through July 31. Highlights this weekend include recitals by the pianist Jeffrey Siegel tomorrow night and Mykola Suk on Sunday night; a lecture by the musicologist and Liszt scholar Alan Walker tomorrow afternoon called ''The Liszt Legacy''; and two talks by  Harold C. Schonberg, former chief music critic of The New York Times. Tonight at 8, Mr. Schonberg's topic is ''How They Played: 19th-Century Pianists''; on Sunday at 3:30 p.m. his talk will be ''How a Critic Works: 50 Years With The New York Times.'' There are also master classes and other concerts throughout the weekend. Recital by Jeffrey Siegel, tomorrow at 8 p.m. Recital by Mykola Suk, Sunday at 8 p.m. Harold C. Schonberg lectures: tonight at 8 and Sunday at 3:30 p.m. Alan Walker lecture: tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. Mannes College of Music, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan. Concerts are $15; lectures and master classes, $10; there is also a $25 pass good for an entire day's events. Information: (212) 580-0210, Extension 336 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>MAVERICK CONCERTS. This enterprising chamber music series, now in its 85th season, offers concerts in an open-sided barn, where the sounds of nature and the music of man interact freely. Tomorrow the acclaimed new-music ensemble Eighth Blackbird offers an evening of works by George Crumb, Donald Martino and others. On Sunday the American String Quartet concentrates on works by Mozart: the two string quintets (with Setsuko Nagata as second violist), and the Adagio and Fugue in C minor. The quartet also offers transcriptions of preludes and fugues from Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier.'' Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., Maverick Concerts, Maverick Road, one mile from the junction of Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., just outside Woodstock, (914) 679-8217. Tickets: $15; $5 for students (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. Can't wait for Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival to get your summer fix? The orchestra's Amadeus Festival should tide you over. This week, the orchestra's music director, Zdenek Macal, conducts Mozart's ''Kleine Nachtmusik'' and Symphony No. 14, and the concertos for two and three pianos, with Misha and Cipa Dichter and Peggy DeArmond-Rogers as soloists. Tonight at 8, Princeton University, Richardson Auditorium, Princeton, N.J.; tomorrow night at 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, One Center Street, Newark, (800) 255-3476. Tickets: $15 to $40 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>NORFOLK CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL. The Yale Summer School of Music retreats north to this lovely spot, and the public reaps much of the benefit at concerts in the quaint Music Shed. Tonight the Tokyo String Quartet, joined at various times by the pianist Claude Frank, the flutist Carol Wincenc and the clarinetist Charles Neidich, offers works by Haydn, Mozart and Ezra Laderman. Tomorrow, for the festival's Viennese Night, the Tokyo performs works by Mozart (the Adagio and Fugue in C minor and, with Mr. Frank, the G minor Piano Quartet) and Schubert (the ''Quartettsatz'' and the ''Rosamunde'' Quartet). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, Routes 44 and 272, Norfolk, Conn., (860) 542-3000. Tickets: $12 to $36; $5 for ages 18 to 25; free to those under 18 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>RUTGERS SUMMERFEST. Typically, this wide-ranging festival veers from one musical style or genre to another: in this case, string quartet to symphony. Tonight the Miami String Quartet plays works by Mozart, Schubert and Ginastera. Tomorrow Richard Auldon Clark conducts the Rutgers Festival Orchestra in a varied program: Delius's ''On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring''; Lalo's Cello Concerto, with Allison Eldredge as soloist; and Brahms's Fourth Symphony. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Nicholas Music Center at Douglass College, off Route 18, New Brunswick, N.J., (732) 932-7511. Tickets: $20 (Oestreich).</p>

        <p>''DANCE AT THE WHITE BARN THEATER.'' Lucille Lortel, whose theater projects included the White Barn Theater, seemed to know everybody in the arts. She also had a well-developed appreciation for dance, which she began to present in 1949, with performances by Katherine Dunham's company. ''Dance at the White Barn Theater,'' an exhibition of archival photographs, costumes and memorabilia chosen by Lynn Garafola, the curator of the show, spans a wide range of dance styles and personalities. Carmen de Lavallade and Geoffrey Holder, who were married on the theater lawn in the 1950's, are represented, along with choreographers and dancers including Mary Anthony, Valerie Bettis, Helen Gallagher, Donna McKechnie, Donald Saddler, Lee Theodore's American Dance Machine and the New York Negro Ballet.

        <p>NEW YORK CITY BALLET. The New York City Ballet will present the new and the old in programming that ranges from George Balanchine's enjoyably cornball ''Western Symphony'' (tomorrow afternoon) to Peter Martins's knotty new ''Harmonielehre,'' set to music by John Adams and part of a gala (tomorrow night) that will also include Twyla Tharp's new ''Beethoven Seventh'' and Jerome Robbins's bright and breezy ''West Side Story Suite.''
