      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Rare  435 West 14th Street  Chelsea  Through July 29</p>
        <p>This noisy, invigorating exhibition is supposed to be about things to come, but it does not really make much sense as a theme show. All the artists share a mordant sense of humor and most have neo-Pop tendencies, but only two are specifically concerned with the future. In her futuristic, MTV-like video, the Korean performance artist Ium runs around abandoned loft spaces in a sexy Barbarella-style outfit, her skin painted silver. Low tech and more original is a funny, handmade flow chart by Beth Campbell in which she maps out ''My Potential Future Based on Present Circumstances.'' Possibilities include ''We forget to pay our bills'' or ''Peter starts to fill space with mysterious locked boxes.''</p>
        <p>The other video makers deal with mass-media conventions. In a music video presented on a grid of big monitors, Guy Richards Smit and his band perform anti-sentimental pop songs like ''I Will Leave You First.'' Candice Breitz's video installation offers a dryly academic deconstruction of the movie ''Grease.''</p>

        <p>Three sculptors head in different directions. In Tony Matelli's bizarre, hyper-real tableau, anxious prehistoric ape men try to reattach their lost tails. Ryan McGinness assembles hundreds of little plastic soldiers on a six-foot-square panel, all for the sake of the punning title ''Saving Ryan's Privates.'' And Michael Phelan presents a Pop-Minimalist stack of empty acquarium tanks. The lone painter, Katharine Finneran, makes kitschy pictures of sickly looking but sexy models menaced by seagulls or a giant fly.</p>
        <p>Besides rebellious youth, it is hard to see what all this work has in common. Maybe the gallery should run a contest to name that theme.</p>
