        <p>In what President Clinton described today as a ''historic step in normalization, reconciliation and healing,'' the United States and Vietnam signed a lengthy trade agreement that, if put into effect fully, would transform America's onetime enemy from a quasi-socialist redoubt into Asia's newest capitalist recruit.</p>
        <p>The 150-page accord covers bank branches, customs fees, publication of laws and regulations, and tariffs on onions, garlic, potatoes and cheese among many other goods, services and investment protections -- a prescription for economic overhaul that substantially curtails the power of Vietnam's Communist Party over its economy.</p>
        <p>Vietnam, with its small, troubled and highly protected economy, risks much more than the United States. But the agreement requires the United States to reduce its tariffs on Vietnamese imports substantially, a concession that has often proved a tough sell in Congress. It is unlikely that Congress will vote on the measure during Mr. Clinton's term, however.</p>
        <p>The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and Vietnam's trade minister, Vu Khoan, signed the agreement this afternoon. At a Rose Garden ceremony shortly after the signing, Mr. Clinton, flanked by several Vietnam war veterans who now serve in Congress, hailed the trade deal as a vital step in resuming full ties. Mr. Clinton normalized diplomatic relations in 1995.</p>
        <p>''From the bitter past, we plant the seeds of a better future,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''This agreement is one more reminder that former adversaries can come together to find common ground.''</p>
        <p>Washington and Hanoi have been trying to seal their first postwar trade accord for nearly five years, about as much time as it took them to sign the Paris Peace Agreement of 1973, which led to the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam. Hanoi balked at American demands several times and walked away from a completed agreement last year, Clinton administration officials said.</p>
        <p>But Vietnamese officials became far more flexible in June, just after the House voted to grant China, Vietnam's neighbor, rival and fellow Communist reformer, coveted trading rights in the American market.</p>
        <p>Clinton administration officials said that China's pending admission to the World Trade Organization and signs that Vietnam's economy had stagnated convinced Vietnamese leaders that the time had come to inject some capitalist energy into the economy akin to the initial wave of reforms that began in 1986.</p>
        <p>''It was a confluence of factors, and China was clearly an important one,'' Ms. Barshefsky said today. ''This will deepen and accelerate economic reforms, strengthen the rule of law, and help Vietnam integrate itself into the world economy.''</p>
        <p>The agreement shows that Vietnam insisted on a comfortable grace period to allow its companies to adjust to foreign competition. Though American retailers can enter the market there for the first time, they will be limited to a single retail store indefinitely. Vietnam would allow American financial companies to issue credit cards, but only eight years after the agreement takes effect.</p>
        <p>In businesses that might affect Vietnam's ability to exercise political control, including phone and Internet services, foreign companies will have to wait at least three years before they can begin to enter joint-venture agreements with local partners, and then they will be allowed to take only minority equity stakes.</p>
        <p>The changes Vietnam has agreed to undertake are similar to those China pledged to make, but the pace is often slower. There are a few exceptions: Vietnam has agreed to allow foreign banks to take deposits and make loans in local currency, the dong, relatively quickly.</p>
        <p>Carlyle A. Thayer, an expert on Vietnam at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu, said top leaders clearly decided to mimic Chinese-style market-openings, gambling that they can maintain party control just as their northern counterparts have. But he said the agreement takes away much of the flexibility the leaders have to dictate the scope and the speed of change.</p>
        <p>''If they drag their feet this time, they are going to be facing legal guerrilla warfare,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The agreement will not take effect at all unless Congress approves the measure and awards Vietnam so-called normal trade relations, subject to annual review. Though Clinton administration officials predicted that Congress would embrace the idea of normalizing economic ties, labor unions quickly disagreed.</p>
        <p>Unions have long demanded that developing countries accept international labor standards as part of market-opening trade agreements. This accord, like others negotiated by the Clinton administration, does not contain language to that effect.</p>
        <p>''I am very disappointed that they did not even attempt to address worker rights,'' said Thea Lee, a top official at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''This is just another agreement that encourages American companies to move their jobs overseas.''</p>
