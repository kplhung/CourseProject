        <p>The General Electric Company, benefiting from a robust economy and its aggressive push into selling products online, said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings rose 20 percent, beating analysts' estimates.</p>
        <p>For the quarter ended June 30, net income rose to $3.38 billion, or 34 cents a share. That compares with $2.82 billion, or 28 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier when adjusted for a 3-for-1 stock split in April. Revenue surged 20 percent, to $32.9 billion from $27.4 billion.</p>
        <p>Analysts had expected the company to earn 33 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.</p>
        <p>''A strong quarter is business as usual for G.E., but this quarter was even better than normal,'' said Charles L. Hill, director of research at First Call.</p>
        <p>Investors seemed unimpressed as shares of G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., fell $1, to $52.50. Analysts, in contrast, were practically adulatory.</p>
        <p>''Most industrial companies are experiencing no more than 5 percent organic growth, so G.E.'s results are just phenomenal,'' said Jeffrey Sprague, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst with Prudential Securities, added: ''You'd need a jeweler's glass to find a problem here.''</p>
        <p>The numbers did little to help handicap the race to succeed John F. Welch Jr., the G.E. chairman, who will retire next year. Analysts expect the heir to be one of three executives: Robert L. Nardelli, head of GE Power Systems; Jeffrey R. Immelt, head of GE Medical Systems; or W. James McNerney Jr., head of GE Aircraft Engines.</p>
        <p>''Succession wouldn't swing on one quarter anyway, but all of the contenders had good results,'' said Russell A. Leavitt, an analyst at Banc of America Securities.</p>
        <p>GE Power Systems had a particularly robust quarter, with sales up 60 percent. All makers of turbines had growth spurts as utilities continued their buying spree, but analysts say that G.E. grabbed share away from competitors like ABB and Siemens.</p>
        <p>GE Medical nearly doubled its sales of X-ray machines, while sales of CAT scanners and ultrasound machines were up more than 35 percent. Thanks to robust sales of high-margin services, GE Aircraft Engines saw its profit rise 20 percent on a revenue increase of just 4 percent.</p>
        <p>Even without new reality or game shows, G.E.'s television network, NBC, held onto a high share of viewers 18 to 49 -- the ones advertisers pay most to reach.</p>
        <p>Earnings at GE Capital, meanwhile, were up 17 percent on a revenue rise of 23 percent. Analysts expect those earnings to rise even higher as GE Capital continues to de-emphasize businesses like the leasing of rail cars in favor of those featuring financial services.</p>
        <p>''They're all over the Internet, capturing customers for services rather than for leases of depreciable assets,'' Mr. Heymann said.</p>
        <p>G.E., never short of cash, will soon have even more. On Tuesday, UBS said it would buy PaineWebber for $12.4 billion. G.E. owns part of PaineWebber and should reap $1.4 billion from the deal. Gary Sheffer, a G.E. spokesman, said G.E. was not consulted on the merger and had not yet made plans for the money.</p>
        <p>Buying back stock is one option. G.E., in fact, bought back $523 million in stock during the quarter.</p>
        <p>But not all analysts like that idea. ''Theirs isn't a cheap stock,'' said Mr. Nelson of ING Barings. ''They should invest in Internet companies whose stories they believe.''</p>
