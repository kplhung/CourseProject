        <p>The author of ''Lolita,'' ''Pale Fire,'' ''Pnin'' and ''Speak, Memory,'' Vladimir Nabokov is considered one of the greatest novelists of the 20th century. What is less well known is that he was also a lepidopterist who named dozens of new species and subspecies of butterflies. One of these, the Karner blue, is a resident of New York State and a federally endangered species.</p>
        <p>While Nabokov was writing in the 1940's, he also studied the anatomy of butterflies at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard. Among the butterflies he examined were some old specimens collected in the 19th century from Karner, N.Y., a bygone village in an area known as the Albany Pine Bush. Although he identified the Karner blue as a distinct subspecies in 1943 and named it Lycaeides melissa samuelis, it wasn't until the late spring of 1950 that Nabokov -- whose prose abounds in butterfly imagery -- took up his net and went looking for Karner blues in the wild. Before leaving he wrote to a friend, the literary critic Edmund Wilson, that he planned to drive to ''a place called Karner, where in some pine barrens, on lupines, a little blue butterfly I have described and named ought to be out.''</p>
        <p>On June 2, 1950, while driving from Boston to Ithaca, he visited the Pine Bush for the first time. Fifty years later -- to the day -- we followed in his footsteps.</p>
        <p>When Nabokov visited the Pine Bush in 1950, he didn't have much trouble finding Karner blues. The day after his visit, he wrote Wilson again saying that he had driven ''to a certain place between Albany and Schenectady where, on a pine-scrub waste, near absolutely marvelous patches of lupines in bloom, I took a few specimens of my samuelis.'' At that time, his samuelis was the most abundant insect in the Pine Bush. A single swipe of the butterfly net was said to have been enough to capture a dozen. These days Karner blues are so scarce that netting one is a federal offense for which one can be fined up to $25,000.</p>
        <p>A Shrinking Home</p>
        <p>Since Nabokov first identified the Karner blue as a unique creature, the butterfly's Pine Bush habitat has been reduced to one-tenth its original size. In 1975, when the Karner blue became the first insect on the New York State endangered-species list, it also became the poster bug for the Pine Bush. Advocacy groups fought development with protests and legal maneuvers, and as a result, more than 2,500 acres of the Pine Bush have been turned into a preserve.</p>
        <p>Yet the Karner blue itself has not fared well. Since the 1970's, the estimate of the butterfly's local population has plummeted to less than 5,000 from 50,000. Biologists say not enough pristine habitat is left for the Karner blues to thrive. Across the butterfly's entire range, a thin geographic band that originally stretched from Minnesota to Massachusetts, Karner blue numbers are down 99 percent, which led to its being placed on the United States endangered-species list in 1992.</p>
        <p>To help track down some of these rare beings, we enlisted Don Rittner, a longtime advocate for the Karner blue and the founder of the Pine Bush Historic Preservation Project, which was organized in 1972 to protect the region's flora and fauna. When we made our rendezvous with Mr. Rittner -- in a diner parking lot off Route 155, just 15 minutes from downtown Albany -- he was wearing a straw hat to protect against the strong sun, and he seemed highly optimistic about our chances of seeing Karner blues. ''Let's go look for the insect that stopped millions of dollars of development,'' he said cheerfully.</p>
        <p>We drove for just five minutes down Route 155 before Mr. Rittner pulled his Subaru Outback off the highway and into an inconspicuous dirt turnout -- not the first place you would think to look for an endangered species. From the road, the home of the Karner blue doesn't look like much. The words stunted and scraggly come to mind. But Mr. Rittner begged to differ. ''I fell in love with this place the first time I saw it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A Different World</p>
        <p>Following Mr. Rittner down a narrow trail, we entered the world of the Pine Bush. Instead of dirt beneath our feet there was sand, and struggling to grow up from this barren substratum was the Pine Bush's version of a forest. Miniature scrub oaks grew no higher than eight feet. Pitch pines with blackened trunks sprouted long needles that looked like cactus spines.</p>
        <p>Sand slipped beneath our feet as we scanned the landscape for hints of fluttering blue. As Mr. Rittner led us up a steep grade, he explained that all this sand was deposited at the end of the Ice Age. During a subsequent Sahara-like dry spell about 9,000 years ago, the sand was blown around and shaped by the wind, meaning that the long, low hill we were climbing was a dune.</p>
        <p>From the top we could still hear the cars on the highway. But we were surrounded by a panoramic view of Pine Bush as far as we could see. And from there it was easier to appreciate this weird ecosystem's subtle charm -- varying shades of green layered upon green over waving dunes.</p>
        <p>''We're in the most pristine part of the Pine Bush, and we're still standing in the city of Albany,'' Mr. Rittner said. ''I don't know any other city in the country that has its original wilderness still in its borders.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the Pine Bush is a biological island surrounded by urban sprawl. Once covering 40 square miles between Albany and Schenectady, it has been steadily built over as these cities have spread out. ''The Pine Bush is like butter to developers,'' Mr. Rittner said. ''It's so easy to build on. They just come in and push the sand around.'' And despite being the home of 300 vertebrate species, 1,500 plants and thousands of invertebrates, the Pine Bush is not an obviously lovable habitat. According to Mr. Rittner, it's been called every name in the book: bleak, blasted, desolate and a wasteland.</p>
        <p>It's also hot as Hades.</p>
        <p>As we continued our search for blue butterflies, there was little shade, and we began to overheat. Sahara-like still seemed an apt description. Mr. Rittner told us he once stuck a thermometer in the sand in midsummer. It registered 140 degrees.</p>
        <p>Butterflies apparently like the heat, though. From the moment we left the highway and entered the Pine Bush, we were besieged with them: American coppers, tiger swallowtails, spring azures, monarchs and skippers. Even before Nabokov named the Karner blue, entomologists were flitting around the Pine Bush with butterfly nets and collecting jars. So many species were discovered in the 19th century near the vanished village of Karner that scientists nicknamed the area Butterfly Station. ''There are 70 species of butterflies out here, which is more than in all of Great Britain,'' Mr. Rittner said.</p>
        <p>Remaining Hopeful</p>
        <p>But no Karner blues. ''This is really not too good,'' said our butterfly guide after half an hour of canvassing the sweltering bush.</p>
        <p>We remained hopeful, because we had carefully planned our butterfly safari. Each year, Karner blues emerge from their chrysalides and take to the air during two short ''flights'' (roughly May 20 to June 10 and July 15 to Aug. 5). Many a naturalist has missed them because of poor planning. Nabokov, however, had visited during the height of the first flight, and we were following his lead.</p>
        <p>The missing ingredient in our search through the Pine Bush was lupine, the lavender wildflower around which the entire life cycle of the Karner blue revolves. Karner blue butterflies will lay their eggs only on lupine stalks, and their caterpillars eat only lupine leaves.</p>
        <p>Fifty years ago, when Nabokov first saw the Pine Bush, it was blanketed in lupine. Periodic wildfires set by lightning cleared away tall vegetation, making way for lupine plants, which require direct sunlight. Since then, a combination of development and fire suppression squeezed out this flower. ''No fire, no lupine, no Karner blue,'' Mr. Rittner said. ''It's that simple.''</p>
        <p>We were about to give up and were almost back to where we started when we found a small patch of lupine behind a parking lot along the highway. About 200 flowers, lavender spikes, created a small blue sea.</p>
        <p>We scanned this oasis, looking for signs of life. Then, right next to the asphalt, we saw a speck, a bluish blur zigzagging above the flowers. ''Yes!'' Mr. Rittner shouted. ''It's a K.B.!'' He then addressed the butterfly directly. ''I see you,'' he said. ''We have some visitors.''</p>
        <p>To his delight, the K.B. was not shy at all. In fact, it flew over, alighted on a spike of lupine at our feet and obligingly opened its wings for inspection. ''Now, it's posing,'' said Mr. Rittner. ''I have so many photographs of this very shot.''</p>
        <p>We bent down for a better look. The butterfly's wingspan was only about an inch. The wings were slate blue and distinctly framed by a border of white. Tiny orange dots decorated the edge of its lower wings. ''Those dots mean she's a female,'' Mr. Rittner said. She flitted over to a neighboring flower and began walking down its stalk, now and then adjusting her wings for balance.</p>
        <p>She inspected other flowers and teetered down two more stalks. Then, at the base of one plant, she began curling her body into a U. ''I think she's trying to lay an egg,'' Mr. Rittner said excitedly. He crouched all the way down to lupine level to get a close-up view. When the K.B. fluttered off, there was a tiny white spot, smaller than a poppy seed, where she had been. ''Look at that!'' he said. ''I've been coming here for 30 years, and I've never seen that before. In fact, I don't think anyone's ever seen that.''</p>
        <p>Nabokov's little samuelis had laid an egg.</p>
        <p>Nabokov's 'Little Paradise'</p>
        <p>When Nabokov wrote his 1957 novel ''Pnin,'' he couldn't resist working in a detailed description of the butterfly he had named. Here's what he wrote: ''A score of small butterflies, all of one kind, were settled on a damp patch of sand, their wings erect and closed, showing their pale undersides with dark dots and tiny orange-rimmed peacock spots along the hindwing margins; one of Pnin's shed rubbers disturbed some of them and, revealing the celestial hue of their upper surface, they fluttered around like blue snowflakes before settling again.''</p>
        <p>After witnessing the egg laying, we crossed the highway to another section of the Pine Bush, this one not as pristine but overgrown with invasive shade trees. As we walked along the sandy paths, Mr. Rittner told us that in the 1970's he and his friends had written Nabokov a letter, hoping to get his support for preserving the Pine Bush from development. Although Nabokov did not join the fight to save the butterfly, he wrote back  that he remembered the Pine Bush as a ''sandy and flowery little paradise.''</p>
        <p>Oddly, Nabokov's original ambition in life was not to write great literature but to make a scientific contribution and discover new species. In his autobiography, ''Speak, Memory,'' Nabokov devotes an entire chapter to his passion for butterflies, and he writes, ''In Jackson Hole and in the Grand Canyon, on the mountain slopes above Telluride, Colo., and on a celebrated pine barren near Albany, N.Y., dwell and will dwell in generations more numerous than editions, the butterflies I have described as new.''</p>
        <p>He couldn't have known that the Karner blue would soon be flirting with extinction. Although we searched for several hours longer, we found only four more K.B.'s, suggesting that, in the end, Nabokov's words might be more enduring than his butterfly.</p>
        <p>Butterfly Search</p>
        <p>Here is information on searching for the Karner blue butterfly, which was identified as a separate subspecies by Vladimir Nabokov and was named by him.</p>
        <p>Nature Walk</p>
        <p>IN ALBANY: The Albany Pine Bush Preserve Commission will lead a Karner Blue Butterfly Walk tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the start of a three-week period when it may be visible. The meeting place is on the western edge of Albany on the east side of Route 155 (just north of the New York State Thruway and about a quarter mile south of Old State Road) at the Karner blue butterfly sign, which is next to the State Employees Federal Credit Union. Wear comfortable walking shoes and light clothing. Bring water, a hat, sun block and tick repellent. No butterfly nets please. Information: (518) 785-1800.</p>
