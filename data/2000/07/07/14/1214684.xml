        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>''AIDA'' (Tony winner for best musical actress, score, scenery and lighting). Pretty much everything that's right about this Disney cartoon pretending to be a Broadway musical can be summed up in two words: Heather Headley. Playing a Nubian princess in captivity, the Tony-winning Ms. Headley has fire, self-possession and an uncompromising sense of purpose. That is more than can be said for anyone or anything around her. ''Aida,'' directed by Robert Falls with songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, seems stranded in its own candy-colored limbo, thrashing between childish silliness and civic preachiness, between campy spoof and tragic tear-jerker, between two and three dimensions. Although it is the first Disney production for Broadway not to be inspired by an animated film, it nonetheless appears to be waiting for the greater destiny of translation into a cartoon. With Adam Pascal (of ''Rent'') as the hieroglyph-stiff love interest and Sherie Rene Scott, making like a refugee from ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' as Aida's rival. The set designer Bob Crowley provided the Las Vegas arcade that is passing for ancient Egypt (2:30). Palace, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4747. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $85 (Ben Brantley).</p>

Pretty much everything that's right about this Disney cartoon pretending to be a Broadway musical can be summed up in two words: Heather Headley. Playing a Nubian princess in captivity, the Tony-winning Ms. Headley has fire, self-possession and an uncompromising sense of purpose. That is more than can be said for anyone or anything around her.

Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $85 (Ben Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT'' (Tony winner for best musical, choreography and featured actor and actress). The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly unrelated vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer leading performances from Deborah Yates and the Tony winners Boyd Gaines and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical, it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as a Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form (2:00). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''COPENHAGEN'' (Tony winner for best play, director and featured actress). Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be such electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (the Tony-winning Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $65; $25 student rush at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''DIRTY BLONDE.'' Stand up, boys, and take your hats off. Mae West is back on Broadway in this compact Rolls-Royce of a vehicle written by and starring Claudia Shear. Eight decades after a play with the forthright title ''Sex'' landed her in jail, West is proving that she still has the power to shock and delight. She has also, not incidentally, provided the inspiration for what is hands down the best new American play of the season. This tale of an icon and two of her idolizers (played by Ms. Shear and Kevin Chamberlin) is no evening of mere impersonation; it's not ''Mae West Tonight!'' What Ms. Shear and her director, James Lapine, have shaped is a multilayered study of the nature of stardom. Bob Stillman rounds out the protean three-member ensemble. ''Dirty Blonde'' presents one of the canniest portraits on record of that floating dialogue between celebrities and fans that remains so much a part of American culture (1:45). Helen Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6262. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $65 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''KISS ME, KATE.'' (Tony winner for best musical revival, director of a musical, musical actor, costumes and orchestration). A mouthwatering revival, with ham as the plat du jour, of Cole Porter's sybarite's delight of a musical about battling egos in show business. As presented by a preening cast led by the wonderful Marin Mazzie and the Tony-winning Brian Stokes Mitchell, who wear a spotlight as if it were a dressing gown and vice versa, this ''Kate'' proves that ham can indeed make a banquet if the spices are zesty enough. Avoiding the attitudes that are anathema to lively revivals of vintage musicals -- reverence and condescension -- the director Michael Blakemore and the choreographer Kathleen Marshall have shaped a show that is broad, brazen and finally irresistible. The production, which doesn't seem to have a thought in its giddy head beyond entertaining us as much as it's entertaining itself, feels like one long ear-to-ear grin. The top-drawer Porter score has been beautifully orchestrated by Don Sebesky and is appetizingly sung by an ensemble that features a sharp-edged ingenue named Amy Spanger (2:20). Beck, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $29 to $84 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''THE MUSIC MAN.'' A show that makes you feel ridiculously happy one instant and seriously sleepy the next. The director and choreographer Susan Stroman, who created the inspired dance-musical ''Contact,'' isn't as confident in her take on Meredith Willson's jubilant story of a traveling con man who brings rhythm to the stolid town of River City, Iowa. Her transforming imagination stops when the music stops. The production has two perfectly agreeable stars in Craig Bierko, in the title role, and Rebecca Luker, as the frosty librarian who learns to melt. But you get the impression that most of the people onstage are just pretending to live in a land of corn-fed propriety and corny jokes, marking time until a production number comes along to let them show their stuff. When the show is singing or, especially, dancing, it seems to have winged feet; when it's just talking or clowning around, those feet are flat (2:50). Neil Simon, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE REAL THING'' (Tony winner for best play revival, actor and actress). This immensely appealing revival of the Tom Stoppard play, from the Donmar Warehouse in London, is a rare thing even in what has been an exceptionally strong season for straight plays: an elegant comedy of infidelity filled with the sort of comebacks that people only wish they were capable of themselves. True, Mr. Stoppard's anatomy of a cerebral (and anachronistically romantic) playwright, played with all-conquering charm by the Tony-winning Stephen Dillane, is also always subverting itself, pointing out how some things, love among them, defy glib articulation. But, ah, how articulately it manages to say so. If its structural game-playing seems a tad too clever this time around, few comedies have managed to have it so successfully both ways. David Leveaux is the highly accomplished director. The delectable Jennifer Ehle, a Tony winner and a standout in an exceptionally polished cast, plays the self-possessed object of Mr. Dillane's affections (2:15). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $70; $15 student rush (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>+ ''THE COUNTESS.'' John Ruskin does not have a happy marriage. ''I don't like the way you look, sound or move,'' he tells his wife, Effie, in Gregory Murphy's serious but wonderfully witty period drama, directed by Ludovica Villar-Hauser. Ruskin (James Riordan), the 19th-century art critic and essayist, invites a friend to join the couple on their Scottish holiday. The guest, the painter John Everett Millais (Jy Murphy), likes Effie (Jennifer Woodward) a lot. But then, his and Ruskin's beliefs about women are very different. ''All bachelors marry goddesses,'' Ruskin observes, ''but husbands live only with women.'' Millais says, ''To idealize is to destroy, smother.'' Things get ugly -- in a civilized way (2:20). The Lambs, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $40 and $55 (Anita Gates).</p>
        <p>''THE CRUMPLE ZONE.'' This new play by Buddy Thomas is uneven, but it has a lot going for it: a nicely structured plot about a gay household with a love triangle coming to crisis at Christmastime, sequences of physical comedy that are antic without being overblown into slapstick, and an effective set that evokes a pleasantly chintzy apartment on Staten Island. Most of all, though, it has a bristling, funny performance by Mario Cantone, who plays the squeaky wheel, a clamorously lonely man on the outside of the triangle looking in. Mr. Cantone is known for his high-pitched stand-up comedy work, and he knows how to take over a room. In this case the room is a tiny apartment, but he works it as a diva would. He is the kind of actor who seems most in control when he's in a tizzy, with a voice that easily and naturally runs up to shrill. But this is not a shrill performance. Even in high dudgeon there's no tension in Mr. Cantone's face or his body language, no sense of Method acting when he's working up to a fever pitch, just the wicked glee of a man who loves to seize the spotlight. The magnitude of his neurotic charisma in such a small space gives his character the hilariously keening pathos that makes the play work (2:00). Rattlestick, 224 Waverly Place, near West 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 206-1515. Mondays, and Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $35 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>* ''FULLY COMMITTED.'' Dining out at the top of the food chain is apparently not about evolved cooking. It's about plain old bribes, threats, tantrums, ego humiliation and outright sadism. If it weren't so sad, it would be funny. Well, it is very funny, actually, at least as it plays out in this mocking dismantlement of megalomaniacal chefs, coked-up maitres d'hotel, food-averse V.I.P.'s and customers with explosive bowels. Becky Mode's one-person play, with the actor Mark Setlock portraying a harried reservations taker at a four-star restaurant where everyone and his grandmother wants to eat, does as much to shake the foundations of the temples of haute cuisine as a squadron of flies in the vichyssoise. Rarely has a playwright pegged so entertainingly the insecurity at the heart of Manhattanites' sense of entitlement (1:30). Cherry Lane, 38 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 6 and 9 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Marks).</p>
        <p>*+ ''JITNEY.'' ''Don't put your business in the street,'' advises a character in this splendidly acted production of August Wilson's early comic drama about a gypsy-cab company in Pittsburgh. As if that were remotely possible in the Hill District, the setting of Mr. Wilson's cycle of plays about the black American experience in the 20th century and a place where private business is always on parade: real life is always the best show in town. ''Jitney,'' which has been extensively revised since its first production in 1982, could be described as just a lot of men sitting around talking. But the talk has such varied range and musicality and it is rendered with such stylish detail that a complete urban symphony emerges. There are whiffs of standard-issue melodrama. But under Marion McClinton's sensitive direction, every performer shines as a soloist and as a member of the chorus. It's the finest ensemble work of the season (2:35). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3. Tickets: $51; $21 student rush (Brantley).</p>
        <p>+ ''THE LARAMIE PROJECT.'' An enormously good-willed, very earnest and often moving work of theatrical journalism. Overseen by the director and writer Moises Kaufman, the inspired talent behind ''Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' this more self-conscious production examines the impact of the brutal killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay university student, on the town of Laramie, Wyo. Eight actors play 60 characters based on interviews conducted by Mr. Kaufman and his ensemble in Laramie in the wake of the crime. The young, clean-scrubbed cast is more effective in creating a general climate of feeling than in summoning authentic portraits of individuals, yet there's no denying the work's emotional pull. The overall effect is not unlike one of the candlelight vigils described here, a stately procession through which swims a stirring medley of emotions: anger, sorrow, bewilderment and, most poignantly, a defiant glimmer of hope (2:35). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Mondays, Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''NEIL SIMON'S 'HOTEL SUITE' '' An omnibus show, a repackaging of elements from Mr. Simon's previous ''Suite'' plays, with some rewriting by the playwright. It consists of four hotel room episodes, two visits each to different marriages, each pair a showcase of a separate aspect of the playwright's comic predilections. The first and third reveal Mr. Simon in bittersweet mode; they focus on an English couple, she an accomplished but insecure actress, he an urbane antiques dealer who also happens to be bisexual with a bias toward men. The second and fourth episodes show Mr. Simon's slapstick side as the marriage of a Jewish couple from Philadelphia is tested by familial rites of passage. It is well performed, but with Mr. Simon's retrograde battle-of-the-sexes humor in full evidence, the show couldn't be less hip. Still, that's not an entirely terrible distinction; you watch with a kind of campy amazement at the jelled-in-amber social attitudes, the punch-line jokiness of the dialogue and the well-worn clowning. Besides, the nostalgia of it all may well be the point (2:20). Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays, 2:30 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Weber).</p>
        <p>* ''PROOF'' An exhilarating and assured new play by David Auburn that turns the esoteric world of higher mathematics literally into a back-porch drama, as accessible and compelling as a detective story. A mystery about the authorship of a particularly important proof, it is also about twin enigmas: genius and love. Without any baffling erudition the play presents mathematicians as both blessed and bedeviled by the gift for abstraction that ties them achingly to one another and separates them, also achingly, from concrete-minded folks like you and me. Perhaps most satisfying of all, it does so without a moment of meanness. As directed by Daniel Sullivan with the pace of a psychological thriller, and performed by an exemplary cast, most notably Mary-Louise Parker, the play reaches into the most competitive and difficult intellectual terrain and finds -- guess what? -- good people (2:00). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Weber).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* ''THE BUBBLY BLACK GIRL SHEDS HER CHAMELEON SKIN.'' Hard-sell effervescence abounds in this charming, self-aware memoir of a musical by Kristen Childs. All that sparkle and fizz has a sting for the work's title character, an aspiring dancer who grows up black with white dreams in sunny, middle-class Los Angeles. Viveca (played with savvy double-edged radiance by LaChanze) treats life as an open audition. She's delightful, she's delicious, she's disgusting as the show ingeniously turns professional perkiness, the lifeblood of the American musical, into a funny, poignant comment on ethnic self-denial. Directed by Wilfredo Medina, ''Bubbly'' deliberately and bravely trafficks in cliches and cultural stereotypes. In so doing, it reminds us of how children accept and measure themselves by such stereotypes, in ways that both comfort and confine. ''Bubbly'' is about exchanging those feelings for fear and freedom; in other words, it's about growing up (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. Through Sunday. Performances today at 8 p.m.; tomorrow and Sunday at 3 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''THE WINTER'S TALE.'' Brian Kulick's production for the Joseph Papp Public Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival is hugely satisfying. In a company that seems extraordinarily suited to Shakespeare and well prepared, Keith David as Leontes and Aunjanue Ellis as Hermione make a stunningly beautiful royal couple. Making full use of the Delacorte's expansive, sky-roofed stage, Mr. Kulick has created an exquisite stage picture of emotion cracking through the scars of time. It's a play that bespeaks gratitude for humanity's foibles and grace, and at the end of this production, walking out into a lovely summer night, you may well hear your heart beating (3:10). Delacorte, Central Park, (212) 539-8655. Through Sunday. Tonight through Sunday night at 8. Free (Weber).</p>
        <p>Long-Running: Broadway</p>
        <p>Here are summaries of reviews by Ben Brantley and Peter Marks:</p>
        <p>* ''CHICAGO.'' This hit remains far and away the best musical for grown-ups on Broadway (2:30). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. p.m. Tickets: $37.50 to $85; $20 rush tickets at the box office.</p>
        <p>+ ''MISS SAIGON.'' Age has both mellowed and invigorated this show. The staging is as sure and crisp as ever; for all the jokes about the musical's helicopter, the second-act evacuation scene that deploys it remains a stunner (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $80; $20 rush at box office.</p>
