        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* ARLING AND CAMERON, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. The disc jockeys, producers and remixers Gerry Arling and Richard Cameron sift the last few decades of pop for campy pleasures and lively rhythms -- 1970's funk, giddy Japanese pop, sputtering breakbeats, French crooning -- and they mix them into tracks that can induce dancing or giggles. They are touring with live musicians on flute and guitar, and a video show. Tonight at 9, with Thunderball and DJ Otefsu opening; admission is $12 (Jon Pareles).</p>

        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* ARLING AND CAMERON, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. The disc jockeys, producers and remixers Gerry Arling and Richard Cameron sift the last few decades of pop for campy pleasures and lively rhythms -- 1970's funk, giddy Japanese pop, sputtering breakbeats, French crooning -- and they mix them into tracks that can induce dancing or giggles. They are touring with live musicians on flute and guitar, and a video show. Tonight at 9, with Thunderball and DJ Otefsu opening; admission is $12 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>B-52'S, GO GOS, PSYCHEDELIC FURS, PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 117, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-0400. Nostalgia for the 80's is in full effect on this triple bill, which could be called Monsters of New Wave. All great in their prime, all worthy of a good living now that their hair styles and arty sensibilities aren't exactly in fashion, these bands will surely still deliver fun and many sweeping gestures in concert. The B-52's made camp postmodern, the Go Gos pioneered grrrl power, and the Psychedelic Furs did that brooding English thing better than any of their peers. (Take that, Robert Smith of the Cure!) Pull out your fuschia clothes and do the Rock Lobster. Sunday at 7 p.m.; tickets are $20 to $45 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>DAVID BERKMAN, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. A smart, fluid pianist whose second record, ''Communication Theory'' (Palmetto), has just been released, Mr. Berkman is part of the true New York mainstream jazz underground: a serious musician who takes the stage only with others of high caliber. His band this weekend includes the saxophonists Steve Wilson and Sam Newsome, the bassist Ugonna Okegwo and the drummer Gerald Cleaver. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $15 (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* MARY J. BLIGE, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Few love fests in pop are as overwhelming as a concert by the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul. Running through her hefty catalog of hits, Ms. Blige belts, moans and testifies about love lost or worth losing, and her soul sisters in the audience moan and belt right back. Sometimes Ms. Blige even celebrates the joy of love and the fun of sex, and then the house really comes down. Tonight at 8; tickets are $35 to $65 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* CHOCOLATE GENIUS, BAMcafe, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4139. Marc Anthony Thompson, or Chocolate Genius, writes desolate, unsparing songs about goodbyes, from doomed romances to senile parents. He has a husky voice and a superb band that can put a subtle jazz swing into his twilight ballads; in a way, he's the East Coast's answer to Mark Eitzel. Tonight at 9; no cover, $10 minimum (Pareles).</p>
        <p>CONFLUENCE PROJECT 2.0, the Anchorage, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Cadman Plaza West and Front Street, Brooklyn, (212) 206-6674, extension 251. Under the rubric ''21st-century soul,'' disc jockeys and live musicians will explore the interface of gospel spirituality, funk and electronics. The lineup includes the disc jockey Joe Claussel, Gregory Ionman Tate's group Burnt Sugar, Imani Azuri and Jaymz Nylon. Tomorrow at 10 p.m.; admission is $12 in advance, $15 at the door (Pareles).</p>
        <p>RICHARD DAVIES, Brownies, 169 Avenue A, between 10th and 11th Streets, East Village, (212) 420-8392. The Australian-born Richard Davies, who now lives in the woods in upstate New York, is like a pop-smart version of a character from ''The Wind in the Willows'': whimsical, in touch with nature and surprisingly wise. Tonight he is joined by Simon Joyner of Omaha, another quietly distinctive singer and songwriter. The bands Lofty Pillars and the Court and Spark are also on the bill. Tomorrow at 10:30 p.m.; admission is $8 (Powers).</p>
        <p>DESI BREAKBEAT CULTURE, the Anchorage, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Cadman Plaza West and Front Street, Brooklyn, (212) 206-6674, extension 251. Modern Indian popular music has been anything but insular, and lately its disc jockeys and producers have been concocting hybrids of electronic dance beats with vocal lines and drumming from India and Pakistan. This concert features a live set from the team of Badmarsh (disc jockey and programmer) and Shri (tabla, flute, other instruments); electronic hybrids with the sitarist Neel Murgai; and disc jockeys from New York's long-running Mutiny parties: DJ Siraiki, DJ Navdeep and DJ Rekha, who will have a live drummer playing the dhol (hand drum). Tonight at 10; admission is $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* JOAO DONATO TRIO, DORI CAYMMI QUINTET, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. Mr. Donato is one of the great bossa nova composers of the late 50's generation, and probably the one most influenced by American jazz; his performances these days are nostalgic and sometimes anarchically funny. Dori Caymmi, son of the great Bahian composer Dorival Caymmi, is a great composer in his own right; he wrote the piquant arrangements for the debut albums of Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, and he also worked with Sarah Vaughan in the 80's. Neither of them comes to New York with any regularity, so for fans of jazz and old Brazilian pop this is an important gig. Sets are today through Sunday at 9 and 11:30 p.m.; $35 cover charge and $5 minimum at tables; $20 cover and one-drink minimum at the bar (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* DAVE DOUGLAS'S WITNESS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Mr. Douglas, one of the best jazz trumpeters of his generation and a composer of fearsome organizational capabilities, convened this band to play music he wrote out of anger at arms manufacturers supplying weapons in the Yugoslav war. The new band was supposed to play the JVC Jazz Festival last month, but the concert was canceled; it's a typically Douglaslike, this-and-that, not-quite-jazz nonet, with violin, cello, electronics, saxophone, vibraphone, tuba and a rhythm section. Sets are tonight at 8 and 10 ; admission is $15 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* DIAMANDA GALAS, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8770. Hey, kids, do you think Eminem is scary? Then you don't know about Diamanda Galas, the true matriarch of popular music's sinister caverns, the woman with the bloodcurdling four-octave voice and the courage to use it to expose society's darkest secrets. In this program, Ms. Galas surveys her repertory, which means you may get to hear her amazing versions of Willie Dixon's ''Insane Asylum'' and Johnny Cash's ''25 Minutes to Go'' alongside her own stirring compositions. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; admission is $30 (Powers).</p>
        <p>LEVON HELM, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42d Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. The Band's brilliantly terse drummer, and the voice of ''The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,'' emerges with his current group. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; admission is $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>THE HIGH AND MIGHTY, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Trying to save hip-hop from its gangsta cliches, groups like High and Mighty and their associates -- including, on this bill, Smut Peddler and Mad Skillz -- go back to the boasting of old-school hip-hop. They combine the required jaunty belligerence with humor, bawdiness and disc-jockey tomfoolery. Tonight at 8; admission is $22 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>KOTTONMOUTH KINGS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Rap plus rock equals boys behaving badly and bragging about it. Kottonmouth Kings are down a few evolutionary rungs from the likes of the Beastie Boys and Rage Against the Machine, and they make Limp Bizkit sound funky. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., with Corporate Avenger, Zebrahead and Pimpadelic opening; tickets are $12.50 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* LUNA, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Embracing the legacy of two-guitar bands from the Velvet Underground to Television, Luna applies the dynamics of strum, drone and build to Dean Wareham's tales of longing and decadence. When he sings about high-tone parties, aimless road trips and creeping paranoia, the songs start out cool, but the writhing, swelling guitars reveal the obsessions within them. Tonight and tomorrow night at 10, with White Hassle opening; admission is $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>DEL McCOURY BAND, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, at Mercer Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. Fans of the eternally (and deservedly) hyped alternative-country star Steve Earle discovered the Del McCoury Band when the hefty singer and songwriter recorded a great album, ''The Mountain,'' with the group last year. But bluegrass aficionados have known about this family dynasty for years. It doesn't get more high lonesome than the sound of Mr. McCoury and his boys spinning tales of ghosts living and dead. Tonight at 7:30 and 10:30; tickets are $20 (Powers)</p>
        <p>RHETT MILLER, MARTHA WAINWRIGHT, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Fans of alternative country have been waiting for a new album from Old 97's, the band fronted by the wiry Mr. Miller, and the word is that they'll soon be satisfied. In the meantime, hear the singer, who rocks hard with his band and  grows sad and philosophical in a solo set. Sharing the stage is the wonderful Martha Wainwright, whose inventiveness just doesn't stop as she feels her way toward glorious maturity. Tomorrow at 9:30 p.m.; tickets are $15 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* JANE MONHEIT, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Ms. Monheit, a young singer who came in second at the Thelonious Monk vocals competition two years ago (in a memorable comeback, the late Teri Thornton was the winner) recently struck a record deal and is going about setting up a proper career. She has the goods, or at least one form of them. She's rhythmic, but not a showboater, and she has great control over her instrument; her sense of reserve has a knowing, pop-music edge to it, as should be the case with a jazz singer under 30. She is playing with a group that includes the saxophonist and flutist Frank Wess, the pianist Bruce Barth, the bassist Jay Leonhart and the drummer Grady Tate. Sets through Sunday are at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m. (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* JASON MORAN TRIO, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. A lot of jazz pianists might as well be wearing T-shirts bearing one name, that of their chosen hero; in an art of subtle tradition-passing, that's just the norm. So it's wild to hear Jason Moran's career develop and progressively know less and less about where, exactly, he's coming from. Here's a player whose vision encompasses the impressionist school of French composers, Duke Ellington, Bjork and music from ''The Godfather.'' All this is combined on his second CD, ''Facing Left'' (Blue Note), Mr. Moran's new trio record; this gig (and the new album) also features easily one of the best rhythm sections of the day, the bass-and-drum team of Tarus Mateen and Nasheet Waits. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a $25 cover for the two early shows, $18 cover for the midnight show; Sunday night sets at 7 and 9, with a $18 cover; there also is a $10 minimum for all shows (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>THE MUFFINS, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. The good side of 1970's progressive rock was its willingness to embrace dissonant harmonies, odd meters and other musicianly notions that could sidestep rock conventions; the bad side was a tendency toward bombast, to which the Muffins never succumbed. The group's tunes stayed lighthearted and whimsical, never flaunting the technique they required. This reunion concert is to be the Muffins' first New York show in 20 years. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 tomorrow (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* NACAO ZUMBI, FUNK 'N' LATA, Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 72d Street, (212) 360-2777. Chico Science was one of the great hopes of Brazilian music in the 1990's. With ''Pernambuco under my feet and my mind in the infinity,'' he put the city of Recife into the forefront of Brazilian rock. He and his group, Nacao Zumbi, came up with mangue beat, named after the mangrove plants that turn muddy swamps into fertile ecosystems. It combined muscular traditional maracatu drumming with hard-rock guitars, funk backbeats, singing and rapping. Chico Science died in an auto accident in 1997, but mangue beat has continued; Nacao Zumbi will play a tribute to him, with Fred 04 from the group Mundo Livre, who wrote a mangue manifesto with Chico Science, and with Brazil-loving New York guests including Arto Lindsay, D.J. Soulslinger, D.J. Spooky and T.C. Izlam. Then the music moves to Rio de Janeiro with Funk 'n' Lata, a 20-man percussion group. Tomorrow at 3 p.m., following a disc jockey set by D.J. Da Lua at 1:30; admission is free. Phillip Galinsky will lecture on the origins of mangue beat at noon at the Arsenal, 850 Fifth Avenue, at 64th Street; admission is free, but reservations, required, are available by calling (212) 360-2777 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>LES NUBIANS, AMADOU ET MARIAM, FREDERIC GALLIANO, Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 72d Street, (212) 360-2777. The French tried but failed to smooth out African music completely. Les Nubians, two sisters from Cameroon, harmonize in cosmopolitan rhythm-and-blues that Erykah Badu fans would appreciate; they move among smooth soul crooning a la Sade, rapping in French, and hints of both American funk and Cameroonian traditions. Amadou et Mariam, a duo who met in a school for the blind in Mali, build their pop from more traditional materials; their songs start out sweetly and spiral upward with increasing passion. Frederic Galliano started out as a disc jockey; he now leads a group with musicians from Guinea and Senegal. Sunday at 3 p.m., with a Moroccan-tinged disc-jockey set by U-Cef at 1:30; admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>PASTILLA, LOS SKARNALES, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Band Shell, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 855-7882, extension 45. Mexican and Mexican-American rockers have been borrowing and scrambling music from the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean, creating an alternative rock en espanol. This double bill features Pastilla, a Los Angeles band devoted to pop-rock and anthems, and Los Skarnales, from Houston, whose starting point is the exuberant bounce of ska. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.; admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Queens of the Stone Age reunites most of the members of Kyuss, a band that draw on Cream's elasticity, the crunch of Black Sabbath's unison riffing, the speed of punk and a streak of desert mysticism from their home in Palm Springs, Calif. After one album of steadfast hard rock, the group has added some variations on its new one, ''R'' (Interscope), which leaps from punk to psychedelia without losing the traction of its guitar riffs. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; admission is $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>JOHN SCOFIELD, ANTIBALAS, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Band Shell, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 855-7882, extension 45. John Scofield, a guitarist who played in Miles Davis's later bands, straddles funk and jazz. Antibalas brings Fela Kuti's Afro-Beat to New York. Tonight at 7:30; admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>''THE TURNTABLE AS ENSEMBLE INSTRUMENT,'' New York Society for Ethical Culture Auditorium, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5928. No hip-hop or current rock fan will be surprised that the turntable can be played within a group. But this concert musters four quartets in music derived from both 20th-century classical music and hip-hop. The art-world turntable experimenter Christian Marclay and three hip-hop turntablists will perform John Cage's ''Imaginary Landscapes No. 5''; another four disc jockeys will perform the world premiere of Raz Mesinai's ''String Quartet for Four Turntables,'' manipulating recordings of violins, viola and cello. The Kolabz, a group of hip-hop turntablists, will perform their version of Rossini's ''William Tell'' Overture; next is the spectacular four-way scratching and beat-juggling of the X-ecutioners, the turntable virtuosos who have been eliciting new sounds from needles, vinyl and mixers since 1989. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; tickets are $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>UP IN SMOKE TOUR WITH DR. DRE, SNOOP DOGG, ICE CUBE, EMINEM AND WARREN G, Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford,  N.J., (201) 935-3900. You have to call it the tour of the summer, even if you're totally bored with the ups and downs of its hottest act, the troubled trickster Eminem. A fancy stage set with plenty of special effects make Up in Smoke a classic rock 'n' roll event, and the slamming hip-hop beats of its stars make it totally 21st century. Interested in what the kids like? This is it. Tomorrow at 7 p.m.; tickets are $45 and $55 (Powers).</p>
        <p>WARPED TOUR, Randalls Island, (212) 830-7715. Impact is everything at the annual Warped Tour, which declares that punk-rock purism is irrelevant. It has been replaced by a genre-spanning appreciation for any music that makes a mighty crunch. The 31-band lineup still includes plenty of punk in both pop and hardcore varieties (Green Day, NOFX, MxPx, Suicide Machines, Anti-Flag), along with rap-rock (Papa Roach), hip-hop (Jurassic 5, Dilated Peoples), ska and reggae (Long Beach Dub All-Stars, Mighty Mighty Bosstones), even Celtic rock (Flogging Molly). If there's not enough action in the mosh pit, fans can watch skateboarding, bicycle and motorcycle stunts, as well as a human cannonball. Tomorrow at noon; tickets are $27.75 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>ERNIE WATTS QUARTET, Iridium, 48 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. A longtime saxophonist with Charlie Haden's Quartet West, Mr. Watts is a virtuosic player; he has a light and durable tone, racing through the tricky harmonies of bebop with calligraphic perfection. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 8:45 and 10:45; cover charge is $20, with a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* ''WHAT IS LATIN MUSIC?'' Midsummer Night Swing, Fountain Plaza, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5766). On Saturday, an afternoon and evening program tries to answer the question first with a panel discussion -- with Eddie Palmieri and the Caribbean-culture experts Al Angeloro, Max Salazar and Robert Farris Thompson -- from 12:30 to 2 p.m. At 3:30, the inquiry moves to the dance floor, with salsa dance lessons; the salsa group Grupo Imagen comes on at 4 and the Tex-Mex group Aztex at 5:35. At 7:10, there is traditionalist merengue by Francisco Ulloa, from the Dominican Republic, one of the world's fastest, wildest accordion soloists. Playing tunes that barely pause for breath, he takes off from the traditional fast arpeggios into breakneck solos that loop and stutter all over the galloping beat. At there is Cuban music by Maraca, who was the flutist in Irakere, Havana's Latin-jazz powerhouse. His own group plays brassy dance music -- mambo, son, cha-cha-cha -- featuring flute solos that skitter and sprint. Poncho Sanchez, from California, concludes the event with funk-tinged salsa at 9:55. The panel discussion is free; admission to the dance floor is $11 (Pareles).</p>
