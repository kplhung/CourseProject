        <p>The usual stillness of summer on the Seton Hall University campus here was broken over the weekend by news that a popular economics professor, his wife and their two children had been killed on Friday in a helicopter crash in Hawaii.</p>
        <p>John Jordan, 55, of Shrewsbury, a professor at the university's Stillman School of Business, and his family were killed while vacationing on the island of Maui. The pilot and two other passengers of the sightseeing helicopter also died.</p>
        <p>''Many days we have wonderful things happening here, but like any family we have highs and lows,'' said Prof. Karen E. Boroff, the acting dean of the business school. ''So we take time to grieve.''</p>
        <p>The deaths are the fourth sorrowful incident at the university this year. On Jan. 19, three students were killed and dozens injured in a dormitory fire that led to revelations of dozens of fire code violations. In March, a small fire in a campus laundry room injured nine students and workers. And in May, a 23-year-old student died two days after being abducted from a street near the campus and shot in the head by a former boyfriend.</p>
        <p>The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the helicopter crash, which occurred around 1 p.m. in a mountainous region near the northwest coast of Maui.</p>
        <p>Because of poor weather, fading light and steep terrain, rescuers were not able to reach the crash site until 7 a.m. Saturday, when members of the Maui Police and Fire Departments used ropes to descend to the scene, the police said.</p>
        <p>The crash victims, in addition to Professor Jordan's wife, Jan Herscovitz, a psychiatrist in Monmouth County, and their children, Maxwell, 16, and Lindsey, 15, were the pilot, Lawrence J. Kirsch of Kihei, Hawaii, and two passengers whose identities have not been release pending positive identification, the police said.</p>
        <p>Today, the Seton Hall campus was typically quiet for July, except for members of the Class of 2004, who were already present for orientation. Some of them would have been students in the two freshman microeconomics classes that Professor Jordan, known as an enthusiastic teacher and natural mentor, was scheduled to have this fall, along with a graduate course in microeconomics and finance.</p>
        <p>Professor Jordan earned a doctorate in economics from the State University of New York at Albany, and arrived at Seton Hall in 1977 as an associate. He was granted tenure in 1983, and a professorship in 1989.</p>
        <p>But his enthusiasm was not confined to economics. Friends and colleagues described him today as an adventurous traveler who took advantage of his academic schedule to take his family on prolonged, often educational journeys. He was an avid wind surfer and basketball fan, and when he traveled to Australia on sabbatical in 1992, a friend said, he had someone videotape all the home games of his beloved Seton Hall basketball team.</p>
        <p>Kristin Kucsma, a former student of Professor Jordan's who is now an adjunct professor at Seton Hall, said  he was ''dedicated beyond belief'' to his students and his family. She described Ms. Herscovitz as ''a very down-to-earth person and always very welcoming.''</p>
        <p>The president of Seton Hall, Msgr. Robert Sheehan, said, ''This is a huge loss for our community.''</p>
        <p>The helicopter in which the family was flying was registered to Blue Hawaiian Company, which also does business under the name D.B.A. Helicopter Services, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Blue Hawaiian would not comment.</p>
        <p>The pilot was involved in a midair collision in Healy, Alaska, on Aug. 4, 1996, according to the F.A.A. In that accident, for which Mr. Kirsch was grounded for 45 days, the rotor blade of his helicopter swiped the landing gear of a Cessna he had failed to see because of what he said was sun glare, according to F.A.A. records.</p>
