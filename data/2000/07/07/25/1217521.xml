        <p>Camera Bravura  The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater will present ''Double Exposure'' a new work by Judith Jamison, the company's artistic director, with a score by Robert Ruggeri, at 8 tonight at the New York State Theater. Dancers in the piece hold video cameras that capture images on two 15-foot onstage screens. The troupe, appearing through Sunday as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000, will alternate two programs. The first, including the Jamison work, Ronald K. Brown's ''Grace'' and Ailey's ''Revelations,'' will also be seen on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday at 3. The second, with four  Ailey works, will be given tomorrow and Thursday nights and Saturday at 2. Information: (212) 875-5928.</p>
        <p>Alfresco, al Philly  Philadanco: The Philadelphia Dance Company is traveling north to present the premiere of ''Unspoken'' at a free outdoor performance at 7 tonight at Rockefeller Park in Battery Park City. The dance, which explores the theme of passion, is choreographed by Milton Myers to music by John Adams. The program, part of the Hudson River Festival, also includes George Faison's ''Suite Otis,'' a tribute to Otis Redding set to songs like ''Just One More Day''and ''Satisfaction.''</p>
        <p>Enter the Benefactors  The Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation are showing their support for the nation's nonprofit theaters with an initial investment of $18 million. That money represents the first two years of a five-year commitment to support the theaters, train future leaders and expand audiences. The first recipients include three New York companies, the New York Theater Workshop, Playwrights Horizons and Repertorio Espanol, plus the American Conservatory Theater, San Francisco; the Long Wharf Theater, New Haven; the McCarter Theater Company, Princeton, N.J.; the Shakespeare Theater, Washington; the Trinity Repertory Theater, Providence; and the Sundance Institute in Utah.</p>
        <p>Amadeus '00  Vladimir Feltsman will be the soloist as the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra concludes its Amadeus Festival 2000 with a program that includes Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 24 in C minor. The orchestra's music director, Zdenek Macal, will conduct on Thursday night at 7:30 and Saturday night at 8 at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark and on Friday night at 8 at Richardson Auditorium in Princeton. The Newark concerts will be preceded by games of Mozart Jeopardy. Information: (800) 255-3476.</p>
