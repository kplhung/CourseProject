        <p>Alastair Campbell, the press spokesman for Tony Blair, holds a job that has traditionally been cloaked in anonymity, but the onetime ''source close to the prime minister'' has now gone high personal profile. He is the subject of a book, the focus of probing newspaper articles and broadcast pieces and the star of a BBC documentary that has just aired.</p>
        <p>As the voice of the most information-management-minded British leader in history, Mr. Campbell has become a closely observed public figure and is credited with such influence that he is commonly portrayed in the press as the second most important official in the government.  He is the first spokesman to sit in on cabinet meetings, and no one in the Blair administration spends more time with the prime minister on a daily basis. His partner and the mother of his two children, Fiona Millar, is the personal aide to Mr. Blair's wife, Cherie.</p>
        <p>So dependent on his favor are the reporters who regularly cover 10 Downing Street that one of them, George Jones, political correspondent of Mr. Blair's Conservative tormentor, The Daily Telegraph, this month wrote a personal essay of complaint headlined ''Alastair Campbell stops me from doing my job.''</p>
        <p>A specialist in labels and sound bites, Mr. Campbell likes to call himself ''his master's voice,'' but to the growing number of government critics, he is a master ''spin doctor.'' The distinction is a crucial one now since Mr. Blair's popularity is falling, and much of the decline is being ascribed to the manipulation and massaging of news to give it a twist favorable to the government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Campbell has always advocated keeping the message simple and succinct and repeating it with numbing frequency to make sure it lodges with the public. Mr. Blair used the strategy effectively in constantly tagging the scandal-ridden previous Conservative government with the word ''sleaze,'' but his opponents have turned the tactic on Mr. Blair and Mr. Campbell with equal success, and the word that has become their mantra is ''spin.''</p>
        <p>''Real people in pubs and on buses really do believe that spin is a dastardly business and that its practice is New Labor's downfall,'' said Sion Simon, associate editor of The Spectator. ''I find it bizarre that the nation should be gripped by a common hatred and fear of spin doctors when hardly anybody has ever met one, nobody really knows what they do and the reality of what they do is actually so mundane. But such is the power of the press.''</p>
        <p>The press is enjoying exercising that power now after three frustrating years of trying to break free of the grip of Mr. Campbell, 43, who uses his athletic six-foot presence and a brash and intimidating manner to cow reporters and their editors. He is a former political writer for The Mirror who once did a much-commented-upon turn as an author of soft-porn fables for a magazine under the nom de plume Riviera Gigolo.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Campbell's first steps on taking office was to cull the senior civil servant information officers in government departments and install political appointees in key spots. The number of these ''special advisers'' has doubled to 79 since Labor took power, and the cost of the unit devoted to policy promotion and swift rebuttal has risen tenfold.</p>
        <p>Employment rules were recast to free him from strict civil service neutrality, and his resultant salary, $150,000, brings weekly protests from Conservatives on the floor of the House of Commons.</p>
        <p>The language of apology or admission of error does not figure in Mr. Campbell's vocabulary, and his habit of responding to lapses and criticism by going on the attack long protected the government from being harmed by bad publicity. But now that same practice has earned the government a reputation for smugness and insensitivity to public opinion at a time when the number of blunders has been increasing. It has put his relations with the press on a war footing.</p>
        <p>''We had -- and I particularly had -- got myself into a situation where combat was the only language that was being spoken, which is not necessarily terribly sensible either way,'' Mr. Campbell told Michael Cockerell, the filmmaker who made the BBC documentary shown this month.</p>
        <p>''I'm out to get the government's voice heard properly as it is,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''I'm out to make sure the public understand the reality of this government and this P.M. That's what I'm out to get, and the political press often -- not always but often -- are the barrier to that.''</p>
        <p>The British press is highly aggressive and competitive, with 13 national dailies selling a startling 14 million copies. Front pages are unblushingly partisan, and proportionality can get lost in the headline emphasis on ''clashes'' and ''storms'' and ''rows,'' which are always ''bitter'' ones.</p>
        <p>The conduct that has drawn the most scornful comments about 10 Downing Street in recent months is the tendency of people in the government to say damning things about their internal rivals. These dismissive comments get widespread circulation because of the willingness of the press to report them promptly and hide the accuser's identity with vague sourcing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Campbell argues that the press is obsessed by trivia, spats and personalities, that it treats politics as soap opera and neglects what the government is really doing. ''He believes that he is more spinned against than spinning,'' said Mr. Cockerell.</p>
        <p>Michael Prescott of The Sunday Times protested that view in the film. ''We're not spin doctors; we are professional decoders,'' he said.  ''Politicians speak a strange language, and it's for us to decode it.  That leads to clashes with Campbell.''</p>
        <p>Asked on camera whether he thought his spokesman was doing a good job, Mr. Blair said, ''I like to think I have hired the best in the business.'' But apparently recognizing the level of mutual abuse that has arisen, he said he had decided to relieve Mr. Campbell of the daily briefing chore so he could devote his time to behind-the-scenes preparation of the government's message.</p>
        <p>Much as the journalists have complained about him, though, they did not welcome word that they would cease having their combative encounters with him every day.</p>
        <p>''If Alastair is not there with that kind of access that he has that reflects the prime minister's instincts and personality as well as the policy lines,'' said Robin Oakley, the BBC's chief political correspondent, ''then we simply don't believe we're getting the voice of Downing Street.''</p>
