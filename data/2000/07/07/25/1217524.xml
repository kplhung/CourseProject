        <p>Peter Lieberson's big Piano Concerto was the piece that put him in the front rank of American composers when it was given its first performance, 17 years ago, by Peter Serkin with the Boston Symphony under Seiji Ozawa. Everyone must have felt the challenge to go for the gold again, but also the danger, of producing a second work that would not measure up to the first. That might explain the delay before the successor's arrival, and the difference it represents.</p>
        <p>''Red Garuda,'' the new piece, was introduced in Boston last October and played again at Tanglewood today by Mr. Serkin, Mr. Ozawa and the orchestra. It is decidedly not a concerto but rather a symphonic poem with a prominent piano part -- something along the lines of Stravinsky's ''Petrouchka,'' which comes to mind partly because Stravinsky is so strongly recalled at the start of the piece.</p>

        <p>Peter Lieberson's big Piano Concerto was the piece that put him in the front rank of American composers when it was given its first performance, 17 years ago, by Peter Serkin with the Boston Symphony under Seiji Ozawa. Everyone must have felt the challenge to go for the gold again, but also the danger, of producing a second work that would not measure up to the first. That might explain the delay before the successor's arrival, and the difference it represents.</p>
        <p>''Red Garuda,'' the new piece, was introduced in Boston last October and played again at Tanglewood today by Mr. Serkin, Mr. Ozawa and the orchestra. It is decidedly not a concerto but rather a symphonic poem with a prominent piano part -- something along the lines of Stravinsky's ''Petrouchka,'' which comes to mind partly because Stravinsky is so strongly recalled at the start of the piece.</p>
        <p>The particular reference here, though, is to ''The Firebird,'' and aptly, for ''Red Garuda'' is also music for a magical bird. The garuda features in Hindu and other mythologies: ''enormous, reddish-orange with wings of celestial metal,'' as Mr. Lieberson describes it in his program notes. He imagined himself carried on the back of such a bird, over volcanic fire, an enormous lake and a mountain range. ''I could hear the flapping of the giant bird's wings and its eerie caws.''</p>
        <p>All this is in the music. The heavy regular rhythm of the beating wings keeps reappearing from different instruments or groups -- a horn, the strings, the solo piano -- and the percussion often add chinks and tinkles suggestive of movement in the feathers made of unearthly copper. After an introductory section, one hears the fire, quite light and delicate in its energy, the calm water (a slow procession of chords) and the mountain winds.</p>
        <p>Future performances will show whether the piece is perhaps too illustrative: too much of a picture book and not enough of a story. It is, for sure, beautifully scored, not least when flashy passages spill out at once from the piano and the percussion or the high woodwinds. It speaks of excitement -- perhaps of the composer's excitement in returning to the scene of his early triumph and in finding a new sense of direction. It sounds as if it will, like the Piano Concerto, be the start of something.</p>
        <p>It offered many opportunities to Mr. Serkin for dazzle and attack, if few for anything more substantial or extended, except in one cadenzalike passage. Mr. Lieberson has left himself room for a real second piano concerto.</p>
