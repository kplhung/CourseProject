        <p>Editorial praises Lance Armstrong, US postal worker who won prestigious Tour de France cycling competition, and Tiger Woods for victory in British Open golf tournament at St Andrews, Scotland (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>There are few obvious analogies between endurance cycling and professional golf. Tour de France cycling, for all its strategic interest, is consummately a physical sport, while professional golf is consummately a strategic sport, though its young players are growing physically stronger and stronger. Perhaps the greatest similarity between Lance Armstrong, who won his second consecutive Tour de France on Sunday, and Tiger Woods, who won the British Open at St. Andrews, Scotland, on the same day, is their ability to demoralize the competition, to leave everyone else playing for second place.</p>
        <p>But to each man his own victory. Like his win last year, Armstrong's triumph in this year's Tour de France is made more significant by the fact that he is a cancer survivor. It attests not only to his own remarkable talents but also to a personal courage that he shares with other cancer survivors. As for Woods, his win at St. Andrews -- following his victories in the U.S. Open, the P.G.A. Championship and the Masters -- amounts to a kind of canonization. By the time he sank his final putt on Sunday evening, the Old Course at St. Andrews was knee-deep in hyperbole, all of it true.</p>

        <p>There are few obvious analogies between endurance cycling and professional golf.

        <p>But to each man his own victory. Like his win last year, Armstrong's triumph in this year's Tour de France is made more significant by the fact that he is a cancer survivor. It attests not only to his own remarkable talents but also to a personal courage that he shares with other cancer survivors.

        <p>When David Duval, playing with Woods on the final round, found himself in a deep bunker on the 17th hole, he faced the nearly impossible task of trying to fly his ball out of the sand and over a six-foot wall a foot away. It took him four shots to get out, and it felt to many viewers, and perhaps many players, as though that wall were somehow Tiger Woods, a resolute, uncanny obstacle in the path of every professional golfer. Duval's struggle, which was heart-rending in itself, gave us an opportunity to witness, yet again, the dignity with which Woods carries himself. As Woods and Duval left the 18th green, bareheaded, Woods rested his right hand on Duval's right shoulder. There was not much he could say, but the gesture meant everything.</p>
