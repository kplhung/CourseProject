        <p>As a news conference was breaking up on Sunday, somebody asked Steve Phillips for his name. ''Babe Ruth,'' said Phillips, the Mets general manager, who can be excused if he is incredulous at his anonymity these days. Phillips has delivered briefing after briefing on his team's plans approaching the July 31 nonwaiver trading deadline, and he has given one theme consistently: something big could happen.</p>
        <p>Phillips said that again on Sunday after announcing that one significant move, the acquisition of Cincinnati Reds shortstop Barry Larkin, had been vetoed by Larkin. ''We've got some big deals we're still talking about,'' Phillips said.</p>
        <p>The Mets were willing to trade the Class AA phenom Alex Escobar plus two good pitching prospects, Eric Cammack and Jason Saenz, for Larkin. That would have been a steep price for a player the Mets only wanted for two months, and it indicates how much Phillips wants to do a deal.</p>
        <p>''He's their biggest chip, there's no doubt about that,'' one baseball official said of Escobar. ''It seems that's a chip they're willing to play.''</p>
        <p>But while the Reds were willing to accept only prospects, other teams may not. For the Mets, the problem with pursuing another big-name player is that injuries to four position players have changed what the Mets have to deal. They mainly used major leaguers to acquire five veterans last July, but that will not be the case now. ''Because of our depth being challenged by injuries,'' Phillips said, ''it's more likely a trade will be prospects.''</p>
        <p>Two players who could be traded include the Philadelphia Phillies right-hander Curt Schilling (who would waive his no-trade clause to come to the Mets but would probably want a contract extension) and Cleveland Indians outfielder Manny Ramirez. But considering what those players' teams want, the Mets seem destined to fall short in a bidding war. The Phillies would want major league-caliber players; they traded starter Andy Ashby to Atlanta for pitcher Bruce Chen and would demand much more for Schilling, their signature player. While Escobar would interest the Phillies, they would need pitching back, and the Class AAA right-hander Grant Roberts is probably the best pitcher the Mets could offer.</p>
        <p>The injured shortstop Rey Ordonez's three-year, $16 million contract beyond this season would be an issue for any team, even one that needs a shortstop, like the Phillies. The Mets want to trade Ordonez to the Baltimore Orioles, but they want to re-sign their shortstop, Mike Bordick, even if they trade him. Bordick appears to be the only available shortstop the Mets value more than their own Melvin Mora.</p>
        <p>A trade for Ramirez seems highly unlikely. The slugger has told the Indians he wants to test the free-agent market this winter, but Cleveland is only three games out of the wild-card race and would have to drop out of contention to deal him.</p>
        <p>The Indians have not listened to any offers on Ramirez and are inclined to wait as long as possible before considering trading him, said Mark Shapiro, the Indians' assistant general manager. If they do shop Ramirez, it is doubtful the Mets could meet their price.</p>
        <p>''It's very, very remote that we would trade him,'' Shapiro said.</p>
        <p>One left-handed hitting outfielder, Al Martin, might be available from the Padres, who are building for the future and want to give playing time to the prospect Mike Darr. The Mets considered Martin last winter but may be concerned about his $5 million salary for next year.</p>
        <p>The most obvious way the Mets could improve is with starting pitching, because of the impact a starter can have on a playoff series or a pennant race. Phillips acquired Kenny Rogers from Oakland last year, and several other starters were traded near the deadline. But lately, the only starter to move besides Ashby has been Denny Neagle, from the Reds to the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''It's different because it's not as much of a starting pitcher's market as it was, or could have been, last year,'' Phillips said. ''But I think there will be some interesting players available because it's going to be such an interesting free-agent market this year.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' rotation has performed well; Bobby J. Jones, the fifth starter, has a 3.25 earned run average over his last seven starts, Rick Reed threw a gem in Atlanta over the weekend, Glendon Rusch has been solid and there are no questions about Mike Hampton or Al Leiter. The pitcher Phillips seeks must be better than what the Mets have, and Schilling may be the only one who qualifies.</p>
        <p>Acquiring a relief pitcher, Phillips said, ''is more likely unless there's a bigger pitcher that becomes available, or you can get somebody to make someone available.''</p>
        <p>The Mets have been scouting the Texas Rangers, who may deal closer John Wetteland if they are unable to sign him to a long-term deal and could also trade the struggling middle reliever Tim Crabtree. But if the Mets trade for an established closer, Phillips stressed, Armando Benitez will not lose his job.</p>
        <p>''I'm not looking to bring someone in to replace our closer,'' Phillips said.</p>
        <p>By this time last year, the Mets had acquired Rogers. They waited until the July 31 deadline to trade for Shawon Dunston, Darryl Hamilton, Chuck McElroy and Billy Taylor. The Mets' inaction looks worse compared to the Yankees' trades for Glenallen Hill, David Justice and Neagle, but Phillips said he will not make moves in reaction to other teams' moves.</p>
        <p>''They've made some moves that we wouldn't have made in the way that they did,'' he said Sunday night. ''It was just right for them. Just like last year when we added our guys at the deadline, they didn't feel the need to react accordingly.</p>
        <p>''There's eight days left before the trading deadline. We're still early in the season, really.''</p>
