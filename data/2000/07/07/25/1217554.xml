        <p>The plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging New York State's system of allocating money to school districts has asked a state judge to order a thorough reassessment of how much it costs to provide a sound basic education to all of the state's public school students.</p>
        <p>The Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the plaintiff in a trial that has lasted seven months so far, said yesterday in its final written arguments that the state's system for allocating education money had put New York City at so large a disadvantage that only an overhaul of the budgetary process could correct the situation.</p>
        <p>New York City, which has 38 percent of the state's students, receives 35.5 percent of the state's education aid, according to the campaign, a coalition of advocacy groups. Because of the demographic makeup of New York City's pupil population, the group said, using the state aid formulas has meant that, on average, minority-group students get less financial support than other students.</p>
        <p>The state, in turn, said in its final written arguments that no such overhaul was needed, citing its finding that even the city's most disadvantaged students fared no worse on standardized tests than similar students in urban and rural districts across the state. Citing mismanagement, corruption and administrative waste, the state also said the city misspent hundreds of millions of dollars of aid each year.</p>
        <p>The statements were submitted yesterday afternoon in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. They were a prelude to Thursday's closing arguments before Justice Leland DeGrasse. A decision is expected this fall.</p>
        <p>Adopting the plaintiff's proposed remedy would be likely to increase substantially the amount of money to those urban and rural districts with large numbers of minority-group children or students likely to fail or drop out. The change could increase state education totals by $3 billion above the present $13 billion, some experts believe.</p>
        <p>Michael A. Rebell, executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, said yesterday that the group's argument, which relies in part on the results of 19 successful lawsuits challenging the education aid programs of other states, gave the judge a guide to follow in ordering a study of how much it costs to educate New York State's schoolchildren.</p>
        <p>''We're not just looking for amounts of money in the abstract,'' Mr. Rebell said. ''We want a fair study that focuses on the costs of education essentials and a way of delivering those services.''</p>
        <p>The plaintiff, represented free by the New York law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, also asked the judge to make sure that the state provided enough money to allow New York City schools to meet a state law requiring that students be tested for vision and hearing problems. New York City schools are now exempt from that requirement.</p>
        <p>The plaintiff's proposal calls for ''an effective accountability system'' to make sure money is used wisely.</p>
        <p>The Campaign for Fiscal Equity also asked the judge to expand a higher court's definition of a ''sound basic education.''</p>
        <p>In a 1995 decision that allowed the current case to proceed to trial, the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, said a sound basic education ''should consist of the basic literacy, calculating, and verbal skills necessary to enable children to eventually function productively as civic participants capable of voting and serving on a jury.''</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs said that definition should be expanded to include the skills needed to ''sustain competitive employment.''</p>
        <p>The change would mean state aid levels would have to keep evolving, incorporating the cost of teaching students to use new technologies.</p>
        <p>In its argument, the state, represented by the office of Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer and the Atlanta law firm Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan, said the educational opportunities available in New York City schools ''substantially exceed constitutional minimums.''</p>
        <p>''Certainly, the New York City school system has the necessary monetary resources to make available to every student the opportunity for at least a minimally adequate or basic education,'' the state said.</p>
        <p>In addition, the state argued that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that the city's schools fell short of preparing students for the job market or that such deficiencies could be traced to the state's aid decisions.</p>
        <p>The state also maintained that the city failed to spend carefully what it received, noting that the Board of Education spent more than the national average and more than almost all the largest school districts in the state. It spent more on teacher training, learning materials and specialized equipment than most other school districts around the country, the state said.</p>
        <p>If the Board of Education needs additional support, the state concluded, it should come from local sources, not from the taxpayers in other parts of the state.</p>
        <p>The weight of the filings, if not the weight of the evidence, falls heavily in favor of the plaintiff. Its so-called brief, containing its proposed findings of fact and remedy, extended to 1,125 pages, with 4,914 footnotes. The state's final argument, by comparison, was a brief in every sense of the word, coming in at a mere 162 pages.</p>
