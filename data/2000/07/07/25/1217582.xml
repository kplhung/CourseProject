        <p>The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, is known back home for his love of military history.</p>
        <p>As chief of staff of the Israeli army, he dazzled -- and disarmed --  parliamentary committees with his knowledge of warriors from Alexander to Napoleon.</p>
        <p>So with cabin fever intensifying at Camp David, Mr. Barak -- who was reported in the Israeli press to be in a gloomy mood and confined to reading in his own suite -- decided to take a break. He requested a trip on Sunday to the Civil War battlefield at Gettysburg.</p>
        <p>In doing so, Mr. Barak was repeating a somber excursion arranged by President Carter at his Camp David summit meeting for the Israeli leader, Menachim Begin, and the Egyptian president, Anwar el-Sadat. Mr. Carter wrote later in his memoirs that as the mediator between two tough adversaries, he wanted to demonstrate the high cost of war.</p>
        <p>And what better place to do it than the site of one of the deadliest battles in American history, where 51,000 men were killed or wounded. To drive home the point that peace is preferable to war, Mr. Carter led the two men to the spot known as High Water Mark on Cemetery Ridge and personally explained what happened.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak ended up at the same spot. He was accompanied by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. They traveled in a motorcade around the battlefield, alighting at only two places: Round Top and High Water Mark.</p>
        <p>There Mr. Barak learned the story of how Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett's Confederate troops were shredded by the Union forces under the command of Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade.</p>
        <p>General Pickett led a final assault  -- known as Pickett's charge -- on the Union lines. About 13,000 soldiers set off down Cemetery Ridge and into a meadow with Pickett's units in the middle. About 350 of his men reached the focal point of the attack -- the High Water Mark -- before being engulfed on three sides by Union forces.</p>
        <p>There were no reports of Mr. Barak's impressions of the military strategy -- just a photograph of Mr. Barak examining a cannon.</p>
        <p>Yasir Arafat opted for a more sedate outing. He has been the guest of Dr. Albright on several occasions at her smart Georgetown home this year, and on Saturday, Dr. Albright invited Mr. Arafat to her farm near Leesburg, Va. Recently, Dr. Albright said that being hostess to Mr. Arafat, who for so many years was a pariah in Washington, was one of the things she least imagined doing as secretary of state.</p>
        <p>But she enjoyed entertaining him at lunch during his Washington visits and he liked to ''chill out'' in the informality of her home, she said. In Virginia, the visit was really informal. Dr. Albright and Mr. Arafat took a strenuous walk through the long grass of her fields.</p>
        <p>A photograph showed Dr. Albright in casual white pants and T-shirt and a blue baseball cap striding alongside the former guerrilla leader dressed in his fatigues, trailed by a posse of Palestinian bodyguards.</p>
        <p>Talking, After Midnight</p>
        <p>The descriptions of the atmosphere at Camp David by the president's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, have been so clinical that they almost defy belief. There has been little hint in his accounts of temper, frustration or stubbornness. Mr. Lockhart seems fairly precise in describing the president's stamina, however. Mr. Clinton has gone to bed at 5 a.m. on each of the last few days he has been at Camp David, sleeping for three or four hours.</p>
        <p>Uri Savir, an Israeli legislator who negotiated with the Palestinians in secret over 1,100 days at the landmark Oslo talks, said he was not surprised by the horrible hours. He describes peace talks as a process of ''attrition.''</p>
        <p>''You work around the clock,'' he said. ''Generally there is a combination of creativity and brinkmanship.''</p>
        <p>Successful negotiators, Mr. Savir said, possess a combination of passion and patience. And as the mediator-in-chief, Mr. Clinton had the right psychological touch: the compassion to understand the different personalities of Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian likes to extend deadlines as far as possible; the Israeli favors putting proposals on the table and cutting a deal. So, it is not surprising that so far, the two adversaries have not met face to face very much at Camp David, although they did sit on either side of Mr. Clinton last night at dinner -- with Chelsea on the other side of Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>But the members of the three negotiating teams have seen each other, day in and day out. The Americans, the Palestinians and the Israelis have all known each other from painstaking negotiating since the Oslo accords of 1993.</p>
        <p>So when Mr. Clinton announced last Wednesday night that the peace talks were over, emotions took over. With motorcades in position ready to drive down the mountain from Camp David, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators began hugging and kissing each other.</p>
        <p>A Drivetime Deadline</p>
        <p>The most frequent question now: when will the talks end? They have gone far longer than most expectations. The Republican Convention begins next Monday. Could Mr. Clinton let the summit meeting cut into George W. Bush's crowning? Mr. Lockhart said today that Mr. Bush had been gracious, saying that partisan politics should not interfere with the work toward peace. But it was highly unlikely, Mr. Lockhart suggested, that it would be useful to string out the talks for another week. A rumor swept the elementary school that has served as the press headquarters this afternoon that Mr. Clinton was looking for a Wednesday wrap.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart had another date in mind. ''There is an informal deadline,'' he deadpanned. ''All parties want to be available to watch Kathie Lee Gifford's last show on Friday.''</p>
        <p>It turns out that the talk show host is not a favorite pop culture icon for Mr. Lockhart's staff. After nearly two dozen briefings, with little to say on the most serious of matters, the boss was having a little fun.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 26, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, a Reporter's Notebook article yesterday about the Camp David negotiations misstated the name of the Gettysburg battle site visited by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel. The site, where Pickett's charge began, is Seminary Ridge, not Cemetery Ridge.</p>
        <p>The article also misspelled the given name of the earlier Israeli Prime Minister who visited Gettysburg. He was Menachem Begin, not Menachim.</p>
