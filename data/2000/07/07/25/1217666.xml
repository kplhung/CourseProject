        <p>After Sunday's 2-1 loss in San Jose, Costa Rica, left them in last place in the four-team group, the Americans find themselves in a precarious position only two games into qualifying matches for the 2002 World Cup.</p>
        <p>Now it is virtually imperative for the Americans to win their three home matches -- against Barbados, Guatemala and Costa Rica. Two of the four teams will advance to a six-team regional final. Three nations from that group will advance to the finals in Japan and South Korea.</p>

        <p>After Sunday's 2-1 loss in San Jose, Costa Rica, left them in last place in the four-team group, the Americans find themselves in a precarious position only two games into qualifying matches for the 2002 World Cup.</p>
        <p>Now it is virtually imperative for the Americans to win their three home matches -- against Barbados, Guatemala and Costa Rica. Two of the four teams will advance to a six-team regional final. Three nations from that group will advance to the finals in Japan and South Korea.</p>
        <p>Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, El Salvador and Honduras appear to be the likely qualifiers for the next round from the other two groups. But it is early.</p>
        <p>METROSTARS</p>
        <p>The MetroStars are a confident bunch these days.</p>
        <p>''I think we'll go all the way in the M.L.S. Cup and the U.S. Cup,'' Mark Chung said. ''We have the team to do both. We can win everything that's out there.''</p>
        <p>The MetroStars (13-7-2) will go into Saturday's All-Star Game break in Columbus, Ohio, with a club-record five consecutive league victories, the most victories (13) and tied with Kansas City for most points (41) in the 12-team league.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars, who do not return to league action until next week against D.C. United, will play the Tampa Bay Mutiny tonight in a U.S. Cup quarterfinal game at Mitchel Athletic Complex in Uniondale, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Tab Ramos and Clint Mathis, who were with the national team in Costa Rica but did not play, are expected to start.</p>
        <p>Octavio Zambrano, the first MetroStars coach to lead the East All-Star squad, named Mike Petke and Daniel Hernandez as reserves.</p>
        <p>Lothar Matthaus is expected to report to the MetroStars tomorrow to have his back examined.</p>
        <p>WORLD CUP QUALIFYING</p>
        <p>Brazil is another team that has yet to find its form in World Cup qualifying. The four-time world champions were shocked by Paraguay last week and will play host to Argentina tomorrow. It will be the first time that the two South American rivals have met in a World Cup qualifier.</p>
        <p>Brazil is fifth in the 10-nation group vying for four berths in the finals. Argentina has won all five of its games and appears certain of advancing.</p>
        <p>Today's qualifying games include Colombia at Ecuador, which has never qualified for the finals, Chile at Venezuela, and Peru at Uruguay. Paraguay will play at Bolivia on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Peru has lost its last three games and travels to Montevideo with the third-string goalkeeper, Leoa Butron, after injuries to Oscar Ibanez and the banishment of Juan Flores for disciplinary reasons.</p>
        <p>ITALY</p>
        <p>Inter Milan announced yesterday that Ronaldo would not be joining the Brazilian club Flamengo on loan. Ronaldo, who is recovering from a knee injury, said last week that a move to Flamengo would be the best way for him to regain his fitness.</p>
        <p>He had surgery this past April for a ruptured knee ligament sustained during the Italian Cup final against Lazio. He is not expected to be fit again until February.</p>
        <p>SPAIN</p>
        <p>Luis Figo became the world's most expensive player yesterday. Real Madrid paid $56.1 million to Barcelona to buy out Figo's contract. The deal appears to have been sealed during the Real Madrid election campaign when Figo's agent, Jose Veiga, signed a contract with the successful candidate Florentino Perez.</p>
        <p>At Barcelona, Joan Gaspart, the club's vice president for the past 22 years, was elected president yesterday. Gaspart, 55, a director of a hotel chain, takes over for Josep Lluis Nunez.</p>

        <p>EUROPEAN UNDER-18</p>
        <p>Three weeks after France won the European championship, the nation's under-18 team yesterday won the fourth junior title for a French team since 1983. The substitute Herve Bugnet's goal in the 80th minute lifted France to a 1-0 victory over Ukraine in the under-18 European championship in Nuremberg, Germany. (AP)</p>
        <p>FIFA</p>
        <p>The FIFA member who said he was threatened before the vote for the 2006 World Cup has been replaced on the executive committee of soccer's ruling body.</p>
        <p>Sahu Khan of Fiji will succeed Charles Dempsey of New Zealand as the Oceania representative. The decision came after a weekend vote in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Dempsey abstained during the final ballot on July 6 when Germany beat South Africa by one vote to hold the 2006 World Cup.</p>
        <p>He decided to quit his FIFA and Oceania jobs after meeting with Oceania executives on his return to Auckland. (AP)</p>
