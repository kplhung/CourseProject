        <p>A Texas inmate whose rape conviction attracted national attention in 1998 after the state's highest criminal court  disregarded DNA evidence and refused to grant him a new trial is now receiving a recommendation that he be pardoned.</p>
        <p>The case of the man, Roy Criner, who was sentenced to 99 years in prison in 1990 for the rape of a 16-year-old hitchhiker, could land on the desk of Gov. George W. Bush as soon as next week. New DNA tests completed this month persuaded officials in Montgomery County, including the district attorney, the sheriff and the presiding judge, to join Mr. Criner's lawyer in asking that the inmate be freed.</p>
        <p>''I'm assuming that Mr. Criner at some point will be pardoned,'' said Michael A. McDougal, the district attorney in Montgomery County, about 20 miles north of Houston. A court hearing will be held on Friday to formally approve the application for pardon.</p>
        <p>Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, said state law required that Mr. Criner's application be approved by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles before the governor could grant a pardon. But since 1997, the parole board has weighed new DNA evidence favorably in recommending pardons for three other inmates convicted of rape or sexual assault. And in all three cases, the latest of which was in May, Mr. Bush has approved the pardons.</p>
        <p>''The governor will make a decision very quickly once he gets a recommendation from the board,'' Ms. Edwards said of the Criner case.</p>
        <p>For critics of the criminal justice system in Texas, the Criner case has long stood out. The case involved the  1986 rape and murder of Deanna Ogg, a high school student who was found bludgeoned and stabbed to death. Mr. Criner, then 33, was charged with capital murder and rape based on statements he made to three acquaintances that appeared to implicate him in the case. The murder charge was dropped for lack of evidence, but Mr. Criner was convicted of aggravated rape, even though no physical evidence tied him to the scene.</p>
        <p>In 1997, a DNA test determined that semen found inside the victim's body did not belong to Mr. Criner. His lawyer, Michael B. Charlton, sought a new trial, and the presiding state district judge, Michael Mayes, agreed.</p>
        <p>But on appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed Judge Mayes's ruling and denied the new trial. Writing for the majority, Judge Sharon Keller concluded that the DNA evidence did not cast enough doubt on his conviction to merit a new trial. She reasoned, for example, that the victim might have had sex with another person ''at a time relatively near her death.''</p>
        <p>Judge Keller, who is now running for presiding judge of the court, also wrote that Mr. Criner may have used a condom, or failed to ejaculate, as an explanation of the absence of his semen. She said the statements made by Mr. Criner outweighed the DNA evidence. Judge Keller could not be reached for comment today.</p>
        <p>Barry Scheck, co-director of The Innocence Project at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York, called the decision ''stunning and outrageous.''</p>
        <p>''It was Kafkaesque reasoning,'' he said, ''and a troubling exercise in mental gymnastics to avoid accepting the truth.''</p>
        <p>The case quickly attracted media attention. The Houston Press, a weekly newspaper, cast doubt on the credibility of the accounts of three people to whom Mr. Criner had made statements. In January, the PBS program ''Frontline'' featured the Criner case on a segment called ''The Case for Innocence.''</p>
        <p>The new DNA testing, completed this month, involved a cigarette butt collected from the crime scene. Tests at an independent laboratory in California, and later at the Texas Department of Public Safety, determined that the DNA of two people could be found on the cigarette, that of Ms. Ogg and of the same person whose semen was found in her body.</p>
        <p>In the view of Mr. McDougal, the district attorney who had opposed a new trial in 1998, this new evidence changed everything. ''It puts the semen donor and the victim at the scene together,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scheck's group, which specializes in using DNA testing to examine questionable convictions, financed the second round of tests because Mr. Criner could not afford the cost. Mr. Charlton, the defense lawyer, said the potential release of his client was encouraging, but he remained adamant that Mr. Criner should have gotten a new trial after the initial DNA testing in 1998.</p>
        <p>''I'm really glad that he's going to be out in my lifetime,'' Mr. Charlton said. ''I thought we'd litigate this case for years, and now it's not going to happen.''</p>
