        <p>The Earth wobbles because the atmosphere and oceans are pushing it around.</p>
        <p>Writing in the Aug. 1 issue of Geophysical Research Letters, Dr. Richard S. Gross, a geophysicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, reports that a mysterious motion known as the ''Chandler wobble'' is caused by changing air pressure at the Earth's surface and changing water pressure at the ocean bottoms.</p>
        <p>As first observed in 1891 by Seth Carlo Chandler Jr., an insurance actuary turned astronomer, the Earth's axis sways back and forth about 20 feet every 14 months. The Chandler is one of several wobbles in the Earth's rotation.</p>
        <p>''It's a famous problem in Earth rotation studies,'' Dr. Gross said. ''It's just taken so long to fully understand it.''</p>
        <p>At the simplest level, the dynamics of the Chandler wobble are easy to understand. ''If you're not a good Frisbee thrower, it'll be wobbly as it flies,'' said Dr. Clark Wilson, a professor of geophysics at the University of Texas at Austin. ''That's the Chandler wobble of the Frisbee.''</p>
        <p>Because Earth is not a perfect sphere -- squashed in slightly at the poles and squished outward at the Equator -- it wobbles like the Frisbee. A Swiss mathematician, Leonhard Euler, first predicted the wobble in 1765, but there has been a lingering mystery.</p>
        <p>Scientists later realized the sloshing motion of the Earth's molten interior ought to quickly damp out the wobble, within 70 years, according to recent calculations.</p>
        <p>But the wobbling continues. That means some force must be banging on the Earth, continually re-energizing the wobble.</p>
        <p>One candidate: changes in the pressure of air and water pushing on the Earth. ''That pushing down on the ocean floor is not symmetrical,'' Dr. Gross said. Imagine children pushing from all directions on a large beach ball. If some pushed harder and some less, the ball would tend to tilt. Because Earth is spinning, the tilt turns into a wobble.</p>
        <p>A 1998 paper in the journal Nature by Dr. Rui Ponte, a senior staff scientist at Atmospheric and Environmental Research in Cambridge, Mass., found that the ocean and atmosphere pressure changes were the primary causes of several of the Earth's wobbles.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gross refined the earlier analysis to focus specifically on the Chandler wobble. Using the latest computer models of the atmosphere and ocean, he calculated that two-thirds of the Chandler wobble was caused by changes in ocean-bottom water pressure and the remaining one-third by changes in atmospheric pressure. The results of the computer models matched the observed wobble between 1985 and 1996.</p>
        <p>''I think it's certainly a plausible explanation,'' said Dr. John M. Wahr, a professor of physics at the University of Colorado. ''My own feeling is that is what's probably doing it.''</p>
        <p>Keeping track of the wobbles is more than an intellectual curiosity.</p>
        <p>''It turns out one of the biggest sources of uncertainty in navigating interplanetary spacecraft is not knowing how the Earth's rotation changes,'' Dr. Gross said.</p>
        <p>Just as it is difficult to point a telescope while standing on a rocking boat, NASA must account for the wobble when pointing radio antennas on Earth at spacecraft hundreds of millions of miles away.</p>
        <p>Isolating the wobble's driving force will also allow for more precise measurements of the period, and that will give geologists a better idea of how viscous Earth's interior is. ''The period of the motion tells you about the interior structure of the Earth,'' Dr. Wahr said.</p>
        <p>Even as geologists have now nailed down the Chandler wobble, there are still other mysteries of the Earth's spin. Besides the wobbles, the rotation axis has moved about 30 feet since 1900, probably because the Earth is still rebounding from the crushing force of the glaciers that covered much of the Northern Hemisphere during the last ice age.</p>
