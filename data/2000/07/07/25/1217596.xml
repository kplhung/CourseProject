They poured larvacide into hundreds of drains, imported a particular fish that eats mosquito larvae and tested chicken flocks periodically for the virus.

        <p>For the last few months the virus has been circling New York City, as dead birds and mosquitoes infected with the organism have been found, first in nearby counties, then in outlying boroughs and now in the city's center. Health officials, concerned about seven deaths last year and more than 50 confirmed cases of the disease, constructed an elaborate war plan over the winter to fight any recurrence this year. They poured larvacide into hundreds of drains, imported a particular fish that eats mosquito larvae and tested chicken flocks periodically for the virus. Officials also placed mosquito traps at 70 sites around the city to monitor the summer's crop of insects and advised residents to get rid of standing water, where mosquitoes breed.</p>
        <p>Spraying was to be the final line of defense, with city officials promising to use less-toxic compounds than the malathion spray employed last year. Environmentalists are opposed to the use of this heaviest of anti-mosquito artillery before one human has contracted the disease this summer. It is an understandable concern, given their fear that the very groups most endangered by the virus -- the young, the elderly and those with immune deficiencies -- could react badly to insecticides. But by spraying on the ground instead of aerially and by making public announcements of the spraying schedules, such problems should be diminished.</p>
        <p>The mayor recently noted that ''human life is more important than birds, fish and insects.'' While he is correct, health officials would do better to stick to a bacterial larvacide in the wetland area that will not do as much damage to wildlife as pesticides. Any spraying of insecticides near the wetlands should also be done with surgical precision. With the help of environmental groups over the winter, the city has managed so far to balance health concerns with longer-term environmental ones. It is a balance that is worth preserving.</p>
