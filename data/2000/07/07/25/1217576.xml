        <p>While the Senate holds back from voting on normal trade with China because of hesitation about Chinese nuclear help to Pakistan, the senators should take another look at something else in the trade debate: the questionable argument that modern technology will force China to liberalize its political system.</p>

        <p>While the Senate holds back from voting on normal trade with China because of hesitation about Chinese nuclear help to Pakistan, the senators should take another look at something else in the trade debate: the questionable argument that modern technology will force China to liberalize its political system.</p>
        <p>As the Chinese expand trade with the West and make greater use of computers and the Internet, the thinking goes, an unstoppable current of ideas will spur political reform. ''When over 100 million people in China can get on the Net,'' President Clinton has argued, ''it will be impossible to maintain a closed political and economic society.'' But will it?</p>
        <p>The Chinese government will never squelch all dissident voices on the Web, but because Internet communication relies on each person or computer having a unique, traceable address, the authorities can find ways to locate users and punish activities they don't like. There is an active debate in the United States, where political freedom is sacrosanct and individuals are guaranteed due process of law, about the clash between citizens' civil liberties and corporations' innovations for protecting security or profits. Imagine the implications in an authoritarian state.</p>
        <p>China is already monitoring what goes out over the Internet and identifying where messages come from. Ask Huang Qi, if you can: authorities have detained him since June 3 for operating a Web site about human-rights abuses. Or ask Lin Hai, who served prison time for sending some 30,000 Chinese e-mail addresses to a dissident information service.</p>
        <p>Even those who only read dissident sites, rather than contributing to them, cannot be sure of safety. Surfing the Internet appears untraceable on the surface, but users unwittingly leave behind detailed footprints, as evidenced by privacy concerns among Internet users in this country. Chinese computer experts have plenty of tools and techniques at their disposal to follow these footprints.</p>
        <p>Then there is blocking and filtering technology. A user can't get a single bit of digital information from the Internet without connecting his computer to it, and services that provide the connections can interpose equipment or software that blocks certain types of traffic or keeps users from reaching certain Web sites.</p>
        <p>The Chinese government has already blocked disagreeable Western sites like The Washington Post and Amnesty International, but the censors have had difficulty identifying offending sites fast enough to block them all. It could solve that problem by adopting a strategy used by a number of American-based systems, like America Online's AOL@School service: Block access to any Internet services not on a pre-approved list.</p>
        <p>Business trends within China could also end up limiting the Internet's power there as a liberalizing force. Analysts of the industry think many Chinese will eventually connect to the Internet not with personal computers, as Americans typically do, but through devices like set-top boxes and mobile phones, which have cumbersome keyboards. Chinese going online this way could shop or get government messages, but might find it difficult to send e-mail or post opinions to a Web bulletin board.</p>
        <p>As Western companies work to protect copyrights and enhance the security of information they collect, new techniques for control of Internet communication are being developed every day. Even if American companies do not sell their innovations to China directly, the Chinese will be able to develop them on their own or buy them from other nations. The Internet won't be free in China until other influences force the country to lift its most insidious trade barrier: the ban on ideas that threaten Communist Party rule.</p>
