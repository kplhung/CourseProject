        <p>St. John's accepted a bid yesterday to play football in the Division I-AA Northeast Conference, clearing the way for the school to offer scholarships in that sport for the first time.</p>
        <p>St. John's began football as a club sport in 1972 under Coach Bob Ricca, went to Division III in 1979 and then moved to Division I-AA in 1993. St. John's played last year as a nonscholarship independent after five years in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference.</p>

        <p>St. John's accepted a bid yesterday to play football in the Division I-AA Northeast Conference, clearing the way for the school to offer scholarships in that sport for the first time.</p>
        <p>St. John's began football as a club sport in 1972 under Coach Bob Ricca, went to Division III in 1979 and then moved to Division I-AA in 1993. St. John's played last year as a nonscholarship independent after five years in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference.</p>
        <p>The Northeast Conference voted last October to allow its members to give a limited amount of need-based aid to football players. Schools can offer up to 10 partial or full scholarships a year depending on financial hardship, and up to 30 players can be on scholarship in the program.</p>
        <p>''It's certainly going to have an impact,'' said Ricca, the only football coach St. John's has ever had. ''How much, we don't know.''</p>
        <p>St. John's signed a one-year commitment to the N.E.C. and begins conference play Sept. 9 against St. Francis (Pa.). The Red Storm has the option to sign for three more years by Dec. 1. The other conference members are the four-time defending champion Robert Morris, Wagner, Monmouth, Central Connecticut, Sacred Heart, Albany and Stony Brook.</p>
        <p>Last season, the Red Storm posted a 7-4 record, leading Division I-AA in scoring defense by allowing just 12.9 points a game. Ricca said that while he doubted the team would now dominate defensively the way it had as an independent, he and the players were elated to be competing for a conference championship.</p>
        <p>Ricca, who has a 141-85-1 record, said he was not using all 10 scholarships this season, and that none were a full package, which would include $15,000 tuition. Ricca said he planned to use seven or eight scholarships a year. ''This will enable us to draw some of the best young talent in the country,'' Rocca said.</p>
        <p>However, St. John's is not aspiring to be a full-scholarship Division I-AA program like Hofstra.</p>
        <p>''We're at where we're at,'' said Ed Manetta Jr., the athletic director. ''We're happy playing at this level. This is good competition.''</p>
