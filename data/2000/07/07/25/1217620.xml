        <p>LIKE Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, Mo., David Cone from Kansas City, Mo., sold his soul to the Devil. There is simply no other explanation.</p>
        <p>The suspicion arose initially last season and has heightened with each of Cone's starts this season.</p>
        <p>Not that anyone thought anything of it at the time, but Cone himself provided the critical clue in the aftermath of the perfect game he pitched a year ago against Montreal.</p>
        <p>Referring to a 1996 performance in which he pitched seven hitless innings but was not allowed to remain in the game, he said: ''I've wondered if I'd ever get a chance again. Going into the latter innings today, that was running through my mind, about how many times I've been close and how this might be the last chance I get.''</p>
        <p>And so sometime in the seventh or the eighth, maybe even the ninth inning of the game against Montreal, when Cone could taste not just his no-hitter but his chance at perfection, he did it. He made the pact, and he has been paying for it ever since.</p>
        <p>In 31 starts since his perfect game, Cone has won 3 times while losing 14. The Yankees have staggered to an 11-20 record in his post-perfection starts. This is no way to gain another chance to win another World Series.</p>
        <p>That is, unless George Steinbrenner made a similar pact a few years ago but with different terms over a much longer period. In coveting the perfect game, Cone was looking only at the moment. Had he to do it over again, he undoubtedly would give more consideration to the future.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner, on the other hand, doesn't think in small steps. Don't settle for one World Series championship when four championships are better. Don't settle for one All-Star when three All-Stars are available. Don't settle for success for yourself when you can guarantee failure for someone who's getting too close for comfort.</p>
        <p>Is anyone so naive to think it was just a coincidence that Ken Griffey Jr. and Barry Larkin both declined to be traded to the Mets? It's possible that Larkin would have been amenable to the idea, but after Juan Gonzalez said no to the Yankees and they wouldn't pay the ransom the Chicago Cubs wanted for Sammy Sosa, no way was Steinbrenner's satanic playmate going to allow the word ''yes'' to pass Larkin's lips.</p>
        <p>As for the messy Sosa business, notice that Ed Lynch is no longer the Cubs' general manager and that Andy MacPhail, the club president and chief executive officer, has had to regress in his career and play general manager. Think maybe a fuming George called ole Beelzebub and said, ''And one more thing. . . .?''</p>
        <p>John Olerud has gone to Seattle, Rey Ordonez is out for the season, Robin Ventura is on the disabled list and having a poor season to boot -- no more ''best infield in baseball'' for the Mets. Roger Clemens hits Mike Piazza in the head, says he didn't mean to. Maybe he didn't. Maybe the hand of Steinbrenner-induced fate guided the ball.</p>
        <p>The Yankees trade for David Justice, Denny Neagle and Glenallen Hill. They don't refuse to come to New York. The Braves trade for Andy Ashby. He happily moves to Atlanta, the Mets' personal hell.</p>
        <p>Every other contender wants to shore up its corps of starting pitchers. The Braves and the Yankees already have the best rotations in their respective leagues, but they secure the best starters available. As soon as they join their new teams, Ashby and Neagle each win two games. One of Ashby's victories, a 1-0 decision, comes against the Mets in a game that has a two-game swing in the standing. No surprise there, bub.</p>
        <p>The Mets, meanwhile, struggle to bolster their chances of reaching the playoffs. Mike Bordick to play shortstop and steady the infield? Manny Ramirez to play the outfield and drive in a ton of runs? Curt Schilling or Mike Mussina to solidify the starting rotation?</p>
        <p>Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, shouldn't be surprised if just as he is about to complete one of those deals, his telephone goes dead and the other team turns elsewhere. Baseball is a game of inches and timing. This is Steinbrenner time, even if it might be the end-of-Cone time.</p>
        <p>When Clemens was on the disabled list last month, Steinbrenner supposedly told Clemens what he needed to do to start winning. Steinbrenner has refused to say what he said, but Clemens has won his first five starts since leaving the disabled list, the first time he has won five straight starts in a season and a half with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner obviously put the fear of the Devil in him.</p>
