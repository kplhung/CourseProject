        <p>Representative Robert D. Franks today attacked his Democratic rival for the United States Senate, Jon S. Corzine, for advocating costly government programs that he said would ''bankrupt the country,'' in an early sign that Mr. Corzine's expansive agenda would be a dominant issue in the fall campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, a Republican, asserted that Mr. Corzine's proposals for health care, education, preschool and long-term care for the elderly would cost more than $750 billion a year, wiping out the federal budget surplus and requiring an average tax increase of nearly $5,000 per taxpayer.</p>

        <p>Representative Robert D. Franks today attacked his Democratic rival for the United States Senate, Jon S. Corzine, for advocating costly government programs that he said would ''bankrupt the country,'' in an early sign that Mr. Corzine's expansive agenda would be a dominant issue in the fall campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, a Republican, asserted that Mr. Corzine's proposals for health care, education, preschool and long-term care for the elderly would cost more than $750 billion a year, wiping out the federal budget surplus and requiring an average tax increase of nearly $5,000 per taxpayer.</p>
        <p>Calling his opponent's ideas ''reckless and dangerous,'' Mr. Franks depicted Mr. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, as cynically thinking he could fool voters by promising them the moon.</p>
        <p>''Obviously my opponent hopes that the seductive appeal of free-this and free-that will induce voters to move their fingers to the lever bearing Jon Corzine's name,'' Mr. Franks said. ''What's sad is that he proposes massive spending increases to address two legitimate, crucial issues of our time -- improving education and improving health care -- but he does it by dangling in front of voters campaign promises without ever explaining how they would be paid for.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, a member of the House Budget Committee, cast himself as a truth teller lifting the veil off Mr. Corzine's ''soft and fuzzy'' television advertisements to expose the Democrat's programs as unworkable. And he once again challenged Mr. Corzine to defend them by debating him. ''He can hide behind his commercials, but he can't hide from them,'' Mr. Franks said.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Franks, who labored in the obscurity of a four-way Republican primary while the Democratic contest dominated the spotlight, today's news conference was a forceful attempt to capture the attention of the New Jersey news media, which in recent weeks have become fixated on next year's Democratic race for governor.</p>
        <p>The so-called free media will be crucial for Mr. Franks, who ran a relatively low-budget primary campaign and is likely to be outspent several times over by Mr. Corzine. The Republican's first major fund-raiser, a dinner honoring Senator John McCain in Woodbridge on Thursday, is expected to raise $500,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks even made a personal appeal today for more coverage of his campaign. ''When I'm home in New Jersey campaigning, I hope some of you will choose to be with me every day,'' he told reporters at the State House news conference. Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, appeared alongside Mr. Franks and chided reporters for paying too little attention to the costs of Mr. Corzine's platform.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Franks directed his complaints mainly at Mr. Corzine, in his first broad attack on his opponent since the primary. And, at times, he lumped him together with the Democrat running for the Senate from New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>''Something is different about this year's election,'' he said. ''What we're seeing, both in New York and New Jersey, are two celebrity Senate candidates running campaigns that are based on 30-second television commercials.</p>
        <p>''Their goal, it seems, is to limit to the greatest extent possible the ability of the press or the public to learn how these candidates think or how their programs would work,'' he added. ''It's as if they're hoping not to disturb a docile public who might be inclined to accept the arguments in the TV spots, and skip the analysis.''</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Franks referred to Mrs. Clinton's failed effort at health care reform, arguing that Mr. Corzine was merely reviving the same plan at a cost of $100 billion a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks used a class-warfare approach to criticize Mr. Corzine, a multimillionaire, for favoring free college tuition for any high school graduate with a B average.</p>
        <p>''Let me get this straight,'' Mr. Franks said. ''Last year more than 110,000 Americans filed tax returns with income in excess of $1 million. Mr. Corzine apparently believes it's appropriate to ask working families who are struggling to make ends meet to pay higher taxes in order to send Steve Forbes's kids to college.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks promised that he would issue his own detailed set of proposals on health care, education and other issues in the coming weeks. His analysis of the Corzine platform, meanwhile, was somewhat misleading.</p>
        <p>To buttress his claim that Mr. Corzine's long-term care program would cost $550 billion, for example, he quoted from Mr. Corzine's Web site, which says that as many as 11 million Americans would need such care at an average yearly cost of $50,000.</p>
        <p>Tom Shea, a spokesman for the Corzine campaign, said Mr. Franks had misquoted the Web site. ''Jon was talking about the magnitude of the problem, not the magnitude of his proposal,'' Mr. Shea said. He added that the only specific proposal Mr. Corzine has made is for a $3,000 tax credit for long-term care patients or their relatives -- which experts say would cost roughly $10 billion.</p>
        <p>''What Congressman Franks has done is manufactured some numbers about what Jon's proposals would cost, without talking about what his would cost,'' said Mr. Shea. ''The voters of New Jersey have a very clear choice here about what their priorities are. We can spend the surplus on an irresponsible tax cut and risk Social Security and Medicare, or we can invest in our future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks acknowledged that his numbers might be off, but suggested it was up to Mr. Corzine to defend his own program. ''Perhaps we ought to have a debate about the cost of Jon Corzine's long-term care proposal,'' he said.</p>
