      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In an interview with a senior Justice Department prosecutor in April, President Clinton denied any recollection of a pledge for a $1 million campaign donation by the Indonesian businessman James T. Riady and denied asking Mr. Riady to help financially the former Justice Department official Webster L. Hubbell.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's comments were contained in a 155-page transcript of his April 21 interview with Robert J. Conrad Jr., the department's chief political-finance prosecutor. The transcript was released tonight by White House lawyers.</p>
        <p>This is the first time that Mr. Clinton's testimony on a wide array of campaign finance issues has been made public. The release came at a time when it was likely to be overshadowed by the impending news of Gov. George W. Bush's vice-presidential selection, but a White House spokesman denied any connection.  The spokesman, Jake Siewert, said the White House was concerned that the transcript would be released by Republicans on the House Government Reform Committee. The Republicans received it, under subpoena, earlier today.</p>
        <p>Nearly half of the interview involved questions about the president's lengthy relationship with Mr. Riady, a generous political patron of the president who, the prosecutor suggested, had bragged to Indonesian government ministers that his family enjoyed a ''direct pipeline to the Oval Office.''</p>
        <p>The prosecutor's line of questioning about the Riadys and Mr. Hubbell is noteworthy because Mr. Riady has been under pressure in recent weeks to accept a plea agreement from the department's campaign finance task force. Mr. Conrad has actively investigated Mr. Riady's activities in connection with campaign contributions made by him and employees of the Lippo Group, the $12 billion Riady family conglomerate, to the president's campaign in 1992, as well as his dealings with Mr. Hubbell.</p>
        <p>A Hong Kong company controlled by Mr. Riady paid Mr. Hubbell $100,000 on June 27, 1994, after Mr. Hubbell resigned from the Justice Department and faced a criminal inquiry over law-firm billings. Just four days earlier, on June 23, Mr. Riady met with the president at the White House after meeting that morning with Mr. Hubbell.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said he could not recall discussing Mr. Hubbell's need for paid work with Mr. Riady.</p>
        <p>''At this time, there was a lot of kind of, you know, a lot of people who knew Webb were expressing some sympathy for him,'' the president said. ''And, you know, if James Riady said to me, I'm going to try to help him, he could have said that, I wouldn't have -- and I mean, it wouldn't surprise me if he did, but I do not remember him saying that to me. And, you know, he might have deliberately avoided saying anything to me thinking it wouldn't be appropriate to do.''</p>
        <p>Later in the interview, Mr. Clinton again denied talking to anybody about Mr. Hubbell's financial distress. ''I want you to understand two things,'' he said. ''No. 1, I believe the people that helped Webb Hubbell did it because, like me, they believed he was innocent. No. 2, I believe Webb Hubbell was persistently persecuted by the independent counsel because he would not lie about me or Hillary.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton was also asked about a limousine ride he took in August 1992 with Mr. Riady in California. John Huang, a former Democratic fund-raiser who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations last year, told federal investigators that Mr. Riady promised to give $1 million and that ''President Clinton's reaction was one of surprise.''</p>
        <p>But the president told Mr. Conrad in the interview that he did not recall the ride or the offer. ''I don't have a specific recollection of what the conversation was, or this fact of the car ride,'' Mr. Clinton testified. He added that he recalled seeing Mr. Riady ''sometime in '92 after I became the nominee,'' and that Mr. Riady had offered to help his campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riady and Lippo gave more than $1 million to the Democrats in 1992, and that money is the subject of the current criminal investigation of Mr. Riady.</p>
        <p>The president was pressed again about whether he could specifically recall Mr. Riady's $1 million pledge, but he said he could not recall it.</p>
        <p>''If he said a million, I'm surprised I don't remember it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Besides questions about Mr. Riady, the president was confronted with a wide array of other campaign finance issues, from his relationship to Mr. Huang and Charlie Trie to his ''livid'' reaction after he discovered the Democratic Party had accepted millions of dollars in contributions from foreign citizens and foreign corporations in 1996.</p>
        <p>''All I can tell you is that I was livid about it, because, No. 1, it was, it was embarrassing,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''Number---- and I thought it was wrong not to vet these things. I thought that it was, it put all of us in a very bad position.''</p>
        <p>The interview was the third since 1997 that the president has given to Justice Department prosecutors investigating campaign finance issues. The transcripts of the earlier two interviews were not subpoenaed by Congressional investigators.</p>
        <p>Mr. Siewert, the White House spokesman, said there was nothing in the transcript to cause the president worry. ''We're not going to give people on the Hill the satisfaction of making an issue out of a nonissue into an issue,'' Mr. Siewert said. ''There is no issue here.''</p>
        <p>A day after the interview, which occurred at the White House,a White House official said the president was not a target of the criminal inquiry and that he had cooperated fully with investigators.</p>
        <p>At several points in the interview, Mr. Clinton portrays himself as a victim who has been hounded for years about questions of overzealous Democratic fund-raising. The tone of the president's answers, which veered between genial and terse and in which he often failed to recollect fund-raising details, differed significantly from the caustic confrontation between Vice President Al Gore and Mr. Conrad, which occurred on April 18 at the vice-presidential mansion.</p>
        <p>A few of the president's answers to Mr. Conrad's questions were reminiscent of the tortured wordplay he used with investigators from the office of former independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr during the Lewinsky investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad also questioned President Clinton about his dealings with other figures at the center of the 1996 campaign fund-raising investigation, including Johnny Chung, Pauline Kanchanalak and David Chang, all of whom have been charged with violations of federal campaign finance laws. The president was asked about letters and gifts he received from these individuals and their foreign business associates and whether Mr. Clinton knew they were raising money illegally from foreign nationals.</p>
        <p>The president staunchly denied any knowledge of illegal fund-raising by these Asian-American fund-raisers for the Democratic Party. ''You've got to understand,'' Mr. Clinton told Mr. Conrad, ''I know this may look incredibly naive, but I had a lot of things going on. I believed that all these people knew what the law was.'' The president added, ''I was aghast when I found out about it.''</p>
        <p>He did say he thought Mr. Chung was ''kind of hustling,'' and worried about having photographs taken with Mr. Chung's business associates. But the president said he was ''not worried about them being illegal givers or something.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad asked Mr. Clinton about whether his policies and visits to foreign countries were influenced by fund-raisers. The president said they had not been.</p>
        <p>The president was extensively questioned about White House coffees he held for Democratic supporters. Like Mr. Gore, who was also questioned at length about the coffees by Mr. Conrad, the president denied that the events were fund-raisers or that there was a price to attend them. The president defended the White House coffees, telling Mr. Conrad that he regretted ''that they got a bad rap in the end because I enjoyed them and found them helpful.''</p>
        <p>While denying that there was any stated price to attend the coffees, he said, ''obviously, we weren't naive. You know, I wanted these people to help us. I wanted them to give us money. But, to the best of my knowledge, nobody was given a price tag to come to coffee at the White House.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton was also asked whether Mr. Gore was truthful when he testified that the coffee's were the President's idea. ''I wouldn't disagree with that,'' the President told Mr. Conrad. He said he could not recollect how many coffees the Vice President attended.</p>
