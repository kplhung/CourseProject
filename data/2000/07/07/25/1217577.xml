        <p>We are in what's advertised as the season of snorkeling, roller coaster riding and cross-country hikes. But with jobs and workplaces getting more intense by the day, an old truth about vacations may be truer than ever: They're about rest. Whether it's at the beach, in the mountains or in the Tuscan hills, sleeping in can be better than venturing out.</p>
        <p>Most people may be sheepish about admitting this, but not my family. We are serious sleepers, and proud of it. We even compare notes. My my sister, my three brothers and I are scattered now, but when we talk long-distance, before discussing our kids' grades, our spouses' foibles or our parents' knee replacements, I always ask: ''Have you had any great sleep lately?'' When the answer is yes, I fluff the sofa pillows, take off my shoes, stretch out and demand details. Where? When? How?</p>

        <p>We are in what's advertised as the season of snorkeling, roller coaster riding and cross-country hikes.

Whether it's at the beach, in the mountains or in the Tuscan hills, sleeping in can be better than venturing out.</p>
        <p>Most people may be sheepish about admitting this, but not my family. We are serious sleepers, and proud of it. We even compare notes. My my sister, my three brothers and I are scattered now, but when we talk long-distance, before discussing our kids' grades, our spouses' foibles or our parents' knee replacements, I always ask: ''Have you had any great sleep lately?'' When the answer is yes, I fluff the sofa pillows, take off my shoes, stretch out and demand details. Where? When? How?</p>
        <p>An acquaintance once bragged to me about landing a temporary job at a sleep research clinic, where he got paid to sleep. I was not impressed. No one in my family would consider sleeping while attached to electrodes and monitors. Even if it meant napping away the working hours as well as the ones in between, this wouldn't be quality sleep. Duration alone won't do.</p>
        <p>But, then, quality alone won't do, either. A blissful childhood memory of mine is of summer nights sleeping in the open air with my siblings, on the big second-floor balcony of our family's cabin in the Uinta Mountains of Utah.</p>
        <p>Don't imagine us curled up in smelly old sleeping bags; we had discovered that beneath piles of quilts on our old four-poster beds at the cabin lay mattresses, circa 1940, that could be folded over and easily, gleefully, carried out to the balcony, where there was plenty of room to spread them out. On those chilly, pitch-dark nights, we'd drift off in our cushiony beds, lulled by the soothing noise of a nearby rocky river. It was the highest-quality sleep. But it never lasted long enough. We grumpily ran for cover as the sun came up.</p>
        <p>The true vacation challenge isn't rock climbing or tennis games. It's finding the ideal combination of unstructured and uninterrupted time for sleep and a quiet, airy and light-controlled setting.</p>
        <p>My siblings and I had both quality and duration when we left our mattresses on our beds, which were in our mountain cabin's sleeping loft.  For the adult vacationer, looking for the perfect spot to book a good rest demands asking questions about not only pine-scented air and distance from noisy roads, but nonintrusive  housekeeping services and gap-free Venetian blinds.</p>
        <p>The ideal way to wake up, of course, is the way we always did in the Rockies: to the aroma of fresh-brewing coffee and sizzling bacon. And not a minute before, let's say, noon.</p>
