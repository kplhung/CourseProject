        <p>Insurance regulators in Florida have placed a subsidiary of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York under special supervision and given the subsidiary until tomorrow to come up with a plan to cover a $4.8 million shortfall in its reserves.</p>
        <p>As a result, HIP officials said they had stepped up negotiations to seek a cash infusion from another health company that might want to form a joint venture with the subsidiary, HIP Health Plan of Florida.</p>
        <p>The Florida company has drained tens of millions of dollars from HIP's New York operation, which is also in serious financial trouble. The latest crisis has developed because regulators in New York will no longer allow HIP to send money to Florida to subsidize the losses, and HIP officials said yesterday that they had underestimated how much they would have to pay on medical claims there.</p>
        <p>The regulatory action in Florida adds to the mounting pressure on HIP, a nonprofit health maintenance organization set up to insure New York City employees and the poor. Both the Insurance Department and the attorney general's office in New York State are investigating HIP's finances, and they are looking particularly at whether it has wasted money on executive perquisites and consulting contracts for board members.</p>
        <p>HIP officials said that they agreed last Wednesday to allow the Florida Department of Insurance to place the subsidiary under administrative supervision. The department has stationed auditors at HIP's offices in Hollywood, Fla., and no expenditures of more than $10,000 can be made without their approval.</p>
        <p>David Abernethy, HIP's executive director in Florida, said he had been cutting expenses and seeking an outside investor. He declined to identify the company with which HIP is negotiating a possible joint venture, but said that if the negotiations fell through, HIP could try to sell the Florida operation.</p>
        <p>HIP expanded to Florida in the late 1980's, buying a small health maintenance organization mainly to serve New York workers who had retired there. But during the last decade, HIP's chief executive, Anthony L. Watson, has expanded the operation to compete with larger commercial health insurers for more customers.</p>
        <p>All told, the move to Florida has cost HIP about $80 million. As competition increased, the losses multiplied.</p>
        <p>HIP officials said recently that last year they had sent $18 million -- all raised from premiums paid by New Yorkers -- to cover losses in Florida, where the subsidiary has roughly 220,000 members. But Mr. Abernethy said yesterday that a recent unexpected surge in claims for treatment that took place during the last year had pushed that loss to $26 million.</p>
        <p>Paying the claims used up much of the Florida reserves, regulators said, leaving a cushion of $1.5 million,  $4.8 million less than what is required. Mr. Abernethy said the Florida unit was paying all of its bills and was not in danger of collapsing. He said it had dismissed several executives and negotiated premium increases with some large customers to improve its finances in 2001. He added that the subsidiary had hoped to get by until then.</p>
        <p>But HIP has also been criticized by some for instances of extravagant spending in Florida as well as in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watson recently acknowledged that the Florida unit had leased a Jaguar and a $7,000-a-month apartment for his use on monthly visits there. It had also rented expensive sky boxes at sports stadiums, entertaining board members and corporate customers in one such box at the Super Bowl in Miami last year. HIP canceled the leases on the Jaguar and the apartment last year, and officials said they have been trying to get out of the leases on the sky boxes.</p>
