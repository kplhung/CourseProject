        <p>John Danforth noted last Friday that his inquiry into the 1993 Waco disaster had been limited to ''whether government agents had engaged in bad acts, not whether they exercised bad judgment.''</p>

The report by Mr. Danforth, the special counsel, cleared Attorney General Janet Reno of any wrongdoing in the federal raid on the compound near Waco, Tex., occupied by a sect called the Branch Davidians.

        <p>John Danforth noted last Friday that his inquiry into the 1993 Waco disaster had been limited to ''whether government agents had engaged in bad acts, not whether they exercised bad judgment.''</p>
        <p>This is an important distinction. The report by Mr. Danforth, the special counsel, cleared Attorney General Janet Reno of any wrongdoing in the federal raid on the compound near Waco, Tex., occupied by a sect called the Branch Davidians. After a 51-day standoff, tanks driven by F.B.I. agents pumped tear gas into the compound, after which a fire broke out, claiming about 80 lives.</p>
        <p>The report found that the agents had not shot at the cult members or started the fire, as many critics of the government's behavior have long asserted. At the same time, however, the report did not address the question whether Ms. Reno had been right to order the assault, which we continue to believe was a reckless move.</p>
        <p>Mr. Danforth rebuked the government on other grounds, mainly its failure to tell the truth about the use of incendiary tear gas canisters. Indeed, it was the disclosure that F.B.I. agents, despite repeated denials and without telling Ms. Reno, had fired such devices that prompted the investigation. According to Mr. Danforth the canisters were launched hours before the fire, landed harmlessly 75 feet from the Branch Davidians' living quarters and did not cause the fire. Nevertheless Mr. Danforth, who described his investgation as ''95 percent complete,'' said the remaining work would focus on why Congress was never told about the canisters, a failure that ''undermined public confidence in government.''</p>
        <p>On the whole, Ms. Reno and the country have reason to be reassured by the report, which seems to put to rest what Mr. Danforth called ''the dark questions'' -- whether the government had conspired to wipe out the Branch Davidians and whether it later engaged in a cover-up. Mr. Danforth's team of 56 lawyers and investigators answered no on both counts, placing responsibility for the fire and for the deaths of the cult members squarely on David Koresh, the sect's leader.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the tragedy need not have happened at all. The one thing the F.B.I agents always had on their side was time. Ms. Reno went along with the F.B.I.'s assault proposals partly on grounds, never substantiated, that children were being sexually abused inside the compound. The agents should have been ordered to starve the cult out and hold the tanks and tear gas. Mr. Koresh might still have orchestrated the same suicidal endgame, but the country would have been spared years of doubts about the wisdom and integrity of its government.</p>
