        <p>Al Groh understands what Bob Sutton is undertaking these days. Both left the college ranks to coach in the National Football League under the man they had replaced.</p>
        <p>Sutton is the Jets' new linebackers coach. Groh, the former linebackers coach, is now running the entire team.</p>
        <p>And both men also know what it is to start over after having enjoyed being a head coach -- and having lost the job.</p>
        <p>Bob Sutton? Isn't he the fellow who spent the last 19 seasons at West Point, the last nine as head coach? And didn't he win an award for coach of the year in 1996?</p>
        <p>Yes, but Sutton, who lost his job at West Point last winter, has a somewhat smaller role now as he tries, at age 49, to coach in the N.F.L. No longer are there teenage Cadets in awe of his authority.</p>
        <p>Instead, he is directing the Jets' linebackers, whom Groh used to chat up as the best players on the team. They include Mo Lewis and Bryan Cox, both of whom have made the Pro Bowl and speak their mind. There is the dogged Marvin Jones, the clever Roman Phifer, the versatile James Farrior and the touted rookie pass-rusher, John Abraham.</p>
        <p>''I think Bob's come in and made the change from being a head coach,'' Lewis said today. ''Now it's more of a teaching job when you have to coach a unit. It kind of surprised me the way he's acted. Sometimes you get coaches feeling their way through. But he's very knowledgeable.''</p>
        <p>That said, there is this: Just how will Groh keep his distance and let Sutton coach? After all, these players developed into a strong unit under Groh.</p>
        <p>''Al has to step back, and he's doing it, so Bob can establish his own identity,'' Lewis said.</p>
        <p>Groh, who joined the Giants' staff in 1989, said: ''I can relate to Bob coming into the league. When I first came in to coach the Giants' linebackers, I had been a head coach at Wake Forest. The Giants were a team where the previous coach was still there.''</p>
        <p>That was Bill Belichick, who became the defensive coordinator.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to get Bob to take the linebackers a step beyond,'' Groh said. ''I tell him what the team hasn't had for a couple of years was a good linebacker coach.''</p>
        <p>Despite the self-deprecating humor, Groh appreciates the quality of the linebackers unit and that the players have known him as their coach.</p>
        <p>''I try to stay away and let him coach,'' Groh said. ''These are players I sat in meetings with for three years. It's not a good idea if they say, 'O.K., we can go to Al.' ''</p>
        <p>Groh believes the linebackers are an even better group this season compared with last season, when Jones was coming back from an injury, Phifer was in his first year after a long career with the St. Louis Rams and Abraham was at the University of South Carolina.</p>
        <p>Sutton, though, does not seem the sort to be intimidated by the situation. He has run big programs -- only Red Blaik amassed more victories at Army -- and he had a stint at Michigan under Bo Schembechler.</p>
        <p>''The thing that impressed me here the most is the knowledge level of the linebackers,'' Sutton said. ''They not only understand what the defense is about, but also how the offense is trying to stress them.''</p>
        <p>With the Jets' opening preseason game against the New Orleans Saints at Giants Stadium on Saturday less than a week away, Sutton has seen his family only once since the beginning of camp.</p>
        <p>When Sutton lost his job at West Point, he moved his family to adjacent Highland Falls, N.Y. The question was whether his family would stay there or move with him to another job?</p>
        <p>''I didn't know I was going to do this,'' he said. ''For nine years I was a head coach. You never think about the day you're not.''</p>
        <p>At West Point, he lived with his wife, Debbie, and daughter, Sarah, who is in high school. A son, Andrew, attends the University of Michigan.</p>
        <p>After talking to former college coaches who had joined the N.F.L. ranks late in their careers, Sutton decided to take the Jets job.</p>
        <p>''The idea intrigued me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he and his family also decided they would stay put for now.</p>
        <p>''My daughter told me, 'I always pictured memories of my senior year in high school.' ''</p>
        <p>So while Sutton stays on Long Island, his wife and daughter are in a house overlooking the Hudson. His daughter is going into her senior year at Highland Falls High.</p>
        <p>''I saw them over the weekend for the first time since camp began,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When the Jets' scrimmage ended Saturday, Sutton went upstate but returned Sunday. His next chance to visit will be Aug. 8. The Jets and the Giants are scrimmaging at West Point.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The agent for CARL PICKENS described the Jets as being in the second tier of teams expressing interest in the talented receiver. But HADLEY ENGELHARD's statement contradicts that of the Jets' football operations chief, BILL PARCELLS, who said Friday that the Jets were no longer pursuing Pickens. Parcells, however, also previously downgraded reports that KEYSHAWN JOHNSON was on the trading block. . . . AL GROH was not impressed with Monday's workout. He thought Sunday's day off -- the first break of camp -- had broken the mood of work, work, work. . . . SIUPELI MALAMALA, a former offensive lineman, said he is now a vice president of Authentigraph, which authenticates signatures of sports figures on bats, balls, photographs and uniforms.</p>
        <p>PRO FOOTBALL  Correction:  August 3, 2000, Thursday  A brief report on the Public Lives page on July 25 about an appearance by Billy Joel at a master class at Southampton High School on Long Island misspelled the given name of a pianist who played songs by Mr. Joel. The pianist is Hyung-Ki Joo, not Hyuang-Ki.</p>
