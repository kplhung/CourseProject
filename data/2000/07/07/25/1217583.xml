        <p>The drugmakers Merck &amp; Company and Pfizer Inc. posted strong gains in second-quarter earnings yesterday, and shares of Merck rose more than 9 percent.</p>
        <p>Net income at Merck increased 16 percent, to $1.72 billion, or 73 cents a share, compared with $1.48 billion, or 61 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 18 percent, to $9.5 billion from $8 billion.</p>
        <p>Analysts had expected the company to earn 69 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.</p>
        <p>Pfizer, which overtook Merck in size this year after merging with Warner-Lambert, said profit from operations rose 21 percent, to $1.44 billion, or 23 cents a share, compared with $1.19 billion, or 19 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 14 percent to $7 billion from $6.5 billion.</p>
        <p>Those results were in line with Wall Street estimates.</p>
        <p>With special items, including costs from Pfizer's merger with Warner-Lambert, which was completed in June, and costs associated with two drugs, Rezulin and Trovan, which have either been taken off the market or had sales restricted because of safety problems, net income was $1.15 billion, or 18 cents a share, compared with $1.16 billion, or 18 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.</p>
        <p>At Merck, executives attributed much of the growth to five drugs: Vioxx, Zocor, Cozaar, Fosamax and Singulair.</p>
        <p>Vioxx, a pain reliever, has been gaining on a competing drug, Celebrex, which is sold by Pfizer and Pharmacia, another drug company, in a marketing partnership. Sales of Merck's top-selling drug, Zocor, a cholesterol-lowering drug, rose 20 percent.</p>
        <p>The news cheered drug stock analysts, who have been concerned about the patents soon to expire on several of Merck's major drugs. The company also said its profit for the 2000 fiscal year could exceed Wall Street estimates. Investors were pleased, lifting shares of Merck $5.875, to $69.625.</p>
        <p>Pfizer officials said that sales of Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering drug, were up 40 percent in the second quarter. Analysts say that Lipitor is on its way to becoming the top-selling drug in the world. Pfizer began its hostile takeover of Warner-Lambert last year largely to gain the rights to Lipitor.</p>
        <p>Sales of Viagra, Pfizer's heavily marketed drug for impotence, were flat in the second quarter. Sales of Zithromax, a top-selling antibiotic, fell, which Pfizer executives attributed to a shorter flu season.</p>
        <p>Before Pfizer announced its results, its shares closed at $47.5625, up $1.6875.</p>
