        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article on prevention of eating disorders (July 18) demonstrates the need to challenge programs that purport to deal with the issue.</p>
        <p>The Scouts on the museum tour in Baltimore are described as ''embarrassed sixth-grade girls'' with good reason. Is this a new type of brainwashing?</p>
        <p>The psychologists leading their tour obviously have their own agendas, and when the girls fail to respond, tell them that one of the most wonderful things a woman's body can do for her is ''Having babies and feeding the babies.''</p>
        <p>Does an 11-year-old need to be propagandized in this way? Less polite girls might have responded, Yuck! Their interests in sports, books, boys, hair, camping, music, and whatever else grabs their attention seem more realistic to their age than a perception of themselves as future baby producers.</p>
        <p>Do we need more teenage mothers? Eating disorders, including overeating and obesity, are recognized problems. But muddled messages, even by the most well-intentioned adults, are also dangerous.</p>
