        <p>Nearly 700 firefighters struggled today to get in front of a blaze that had burned some  22,000 acres of brush in the Mesa Verde National Park and was closing in on the park's famous ancient Indian cliff dwellings.</p>
        <p>Fierce winds had already pushed the fire to within four miles of the 1,000-year-old cliff homes. And Justin Dombrowski, information officer with the Rocky Mountain Incident Command Team, which is overseeing the operation, said, ''Even if the flames don't touch the sites, there is concern for damage from the scorching heat of the fire,'' and from erosion now that there are thousands of burned acres lacking the brush to soak up any subsequent rain.</p>
        <p>The fire at the 52,000-acre park, in far southwestern Colorado, was touched off by lightning last Thursday. All visitors to the park, some 700 people, were evacuated that day, along with a number of park employees. But about 50 remaining employees and their families did not leave until early today, after the blaze had already jumped the access road, which fire crews felt was now safe to use again.</p>
        <p>The fire tripled in size on Sunday, when a huge plume of smoke could be seen for miles around and ash rained down on surrounding towns. By today it was nine miles long.</p>
        <p>The blaze has moved generally to the west, in the direction of the cliff dwellings. But the wind has been so fickle, and the fire so dangerous, that the crews have had a hard time getting in front of the flames to try to halt them.</p>
        <p>''The concern is that it's a very explosive fire, and it's at the point where they can't do much in front,'' Mr. Dombrowski said.</p>
        <p>''The fire is so intense,'' he added, ''that it generates its own weather, creates its own wind.''</p>
        <p>Typically, a fire burns hottest in the afternoon. But, in one measure of the unpredictability of this one, it exploded early Sunday morning, before doing so again on Sunday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Adding to the hardship confronting the crews is that temperatures at the park have been in the high 80's or even the 90's of late, and there is no rain in the forecast.</p>
        <p>After a fire approached the Indian dwellings in 1996, park workers removed overgrown brush in their path. Mr. Dombrowski said the hope now was that this preventive measure would slow the current fire and allow it to be contained.</p>
        <p>The fire is also burning on nearby private ranch and farm land and on the Ute Mountain Ute Reservation, south of the park. But it does not appear to be close to any of the reservation's people or structures, Mr. Dombrowski said.</p>
        <p>Park archaeologists learned after the 1996 fire that there had been some advantages to it: previously unknown archaeology sites were uncovered when the pinyon and juniper bushes were burned away.</p>
        <p>But at those sites ''they aren't discovering anything to the extent'' of the cliff dwellings, Mr. Dombrowski said.</p>
