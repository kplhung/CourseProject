        <p>Two weeks ago today, at 10:20 a.m., the Northridge earthquake struck again.</p>
        <p>But instead of Northridge, a suburb north of Los Angeles, the epicenter this time was a house 140 miles to the south, in a laboratory at the University of California at San Diego.</p>
        <p>Dozens of temblors have struck this house since January, all inflicted by an earthquake simulator as part of research to understand how earthquakes shake wood-frame houses, which account for more than 90 percent of Southern California homes.</p>
        <p>Because most wood-frame buildings are just one or two stories high and because wood can bend without breaking, the conventional engineering wisdom has been that wood buildings survive earthquakes better than other types of construction.</p>
        <p>''There hasn't been a lot of attention to wood structures,'' said Dr. John Hall, a professor of civil engineering at the California Institute of Technology and manager of the house-shaking project.</p>
        <p>The wood-frame construction of a typical California house is simple: a skeleton of two-by-four studs with a plywood shell, an outer skin of stucco and an inner skin of drywall. But the dynamics of a wood-frame house in an earthquake are not.</p>
        <p>''These are complicated beasts, a lot more than you would think,'' Dr. Hall said. ''Wood is a kind of messy construction to deal with. You have all these components interacting.''</p>
        <p>The 1994 Northridge earthquake inflicted considerable damage to wood-frame buildings and showed that the conventional wisdom required some updating.</p>
        <p>While most wood-frame buildings survived without significant damage, the earthquake, with a magnitude of 6.7, was centered in a residential area and caused about $10 billion of damage to homes.</p>
        <p>''Northridge was really the first time that showed the vulnerability of wood frame,'' said Dr. Andre Filiatrault, a professor of structural engineering at San Diego and the project's principal investigator.</p>
        <p>For the last six months, a consortium of universities has been building, shaking and rebuilding a house atop a hydraulic ''shake table'' that simulates earthquake movements.</p>
        <p>In the July 11 test, the shake table faithfully reproduced 20 seconds of ground movements recorded during the Northridge earthquake 10 miles from the epicenter.</p>
        <p>Inside the fully furnished two-story, 600-square-foot test house, appliances toppled and shelves that had not been anchored to the floor or a wall fell. The structure, built in accordance with the latest construction codes, came through with just a few small cracks.</p>
        <p>One of the lessons learned appears to be the power of stucco. Like most houses in Southern California, the test house's exterior wall is a layer of stucco mounted onto a wire mesh attached outside the plywood sheathing. Stucco is stiff, adding strength, but brittle. Before the test, most of the engineers expected the shaking to break the stucco apart.</p>
        <p>In an earlier test, without the stucco and drywall interior walls, the top of the house swayed back and forth five inches relative to the bottom. In the latest test, the top swayed only one inch.</p>
        <p>''Those materials have the potential of providing a lot of earthquake resistance,'' Dr. Hall said. ''The building was quite a bit stronger than when we previously tested it.''</p>
        <p>The revised 1997 building code downgraded stucco's effectiveness rating in resisting the shaking of an earthquake because in the Northridge quake, the outer stucco layer literally peeled off many homes, perhaps because of poor construction.</p>
        <p>There was ''a lot of evidence'' in the real quake that it didn't do well and that more testing needed to be done, said Nicolino Delli Quadri, assistant chief of the engineering bureau in the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety.</p>
        <p>The simple box shape of the test house may have also made it more durable.</p>
        <p>The tests, financed with $5 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will shape guidelines to help insurance companies determine when, for example, a crack in the stucco is cosmetic and when it signals structural damage.</p>
        <p>Patching stucco costs a few hundred dollars; replacing it costs tens of thousands. ''The insurance agencies in California are very interested in this second question of what extent repairs are necessary to repair structures to their original condition,'' Dr. Hall said.</p>
