        <p>A federal judge has rejected the Giuliani administration's efforts to move ahead with its sweeping welfare-to-work project, ruling that the city cannot turn any more of its welfare centers into job centers, which discourage the poor from seeking public assistance.</p>
        <p>In the ruling, made public yesterday, the judge found no reliable evidence that the city had stopped illegally denying emergency food stamps, Medicaid and cash aid to eligible applicants -- like pregnant women with young children and disabled, homeless adults -- and refused to lift the temporary ban he imposed last year on the conversion of welfare offices.</p>

        <p>A federal judge has rejected the Giuliani administration's efforts to move ahead with its sweeping welfare-to-work project, ruling that the city cannot turn any more of its welfare centers into job centers, which discourage the poor from seeking public assistance.</p>
        <p>In the ruling, made public yesterday, the judge found no reliable evidence that the city had stopped illegally denying emergency food stamps, Medicaid and cash aid to eligible applicants -- like pregnant women with young children and disabled, homeless adults -- and refused to lift the temporary ban he imposed last year on the conversion of welfare offices.</p>
        <p>The judge, William H. Pauley III of Federal District Court in Lower Manhattan, ruled that the audits the city gave the court to show improvement in its practices were ''hastily conceived'' and ''fundamentally flawed'' and that ''the deck was stacked in favor of job centers.''</p>
        <p>The judge said he rejected the city's argument ''that errors and deficiencies at job centers were isolated problems.''</p>
        <p>''On the contrary, the evidence pointed to systemwide failures resulting from H.R.A.'s hurried conversions,'' he added, referring to the Human Resources Administration. The court, he said, ''declines the city's invitation to take a leap of faith'' that its plan of correction is now working.</p>
        <p>In a victory for the lawyers for the poor who brought the case, Reynolds v. Giuliani, the judge granted class-action status to the plaintiffs. That allows them to sue the city and the state for violations of their civil rights under federal law on behalf of all poor New Yorkers who have sought aid at job centers or may in the future.</p>
        <p>The city had taken the unusual step of hiring a top Washington law firm, Covington &amp; Burling, to help lawyers for the city present its case that it should be allowed to turn 12 remaining welfare centers into job centers like the 16 converted since the program began in April 1998.</p>
        <p>The city has made job centers the heart of an effort to discourage people from seeking cash assistance, as allowed under the federal welfare overhaul of 1996. Job centers require that applicants look for work or prepare for jobs and pass rigorous eligibility tests before their applications are accepted.</p>
        <p>But in his decision last year, the judge found that in the process the city was routinely delaying or denying applications for food stamps and Medicaid in violation of federal law, and denying cash aid to many who were eligible under state law. At welfare offices, all applications for benefits are processed with fewer hurdles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani belittled the judge's new ruling against the conversions, calling it ''irrational'' and ''rambling.'' He maintained that it would have little or no effect, because the job centers operating now have already worked.</p>
        <p>''The city has been transformed,'' he said during a news conference at the Seaport Job Center, pointing to a chart that showed welfare caseloads had shrunk to 572,872 as of June from 1,160,593 in March 1995.</p>
        <p>''This job center is part of that transformation,'' he said. ''Now, when you come in here and you want welfare, the first thing we try to do is try to find you a job, because we really care about you, we really love you and we really understand the human personality a lot better than the people who brought us dependency.''</p>
        <p>But more than two years after the  welfare commissioner, Jason Turner, began the ambitious welfare overhaul, the judge's detailed and highly critical assessment of the Human Resources Administration's auditing methods renews questions about the city's welfare statistics.</p>
        <p>''If the city's claiming success, I don't know what data they're relying upon,'' Hwan Hui Helen Lee, a Legal Aid Society lawyer, said yesterday. ''The decision shows the city is not really taking a serious look at who is being denied the opportunity to file an application for these benefits.</p>
        <p>''These are hungry people who are coming to job centers as a last resort, as a safety net, because they have not been able to take advantage of this economic revival that's happening in New York City.''</p>
        <p>One problem cited by Judge Pauley was that a city computer system  automatically purged the record of welfare applications withdrawn the same day they were filed, and wiped out any evidence of multiple applications made by people who had been wrongly rejected the first time.</p>
        <p>Judge Pauley also cited affidavits filed by the plaintiffs' lawyers, who interviewed applicants at job centers in October, November and December and outlined probable violations in 61 out of 225 cases.</p>
        <p>Those cases included a 24-year-old woman in her ninth month of pregnancy who was told she was ineligible for food stamps because she was not a citizen, and a 17-year-old woman who had no milk or pampers for her 10-month-old baby and was turned away after waiting all day to apply for emergency aid because ''the worker told her she was in the wrong center for her zip code.''</p>
        <p>According to federal regulations, both women should have received assistance. Instead, the women withdrew their applications.</p>
        <p>Experts for the plaintiffs said such cases were unlikely to show up in the city's sample of 1,893 cases, drawn from about 168,000 public assistance applications filed last year, because the sample excluded all but a dozen cases that had been withdrawn.</p>
        <p>One method the city now uses to monitor welfare workers is sending ''spot-checkers'' who pose as poor people and ask for an application form. But the judge said the program's effectiveness had been tempered by ''the failure of spot-checkers to adequately vary the scenario they present,'' suggesting that workers learn to recognize the testers. Also, he said, since checkers do not turn in those forms, the city never finds out whether such applications would have been accepted.</p>
        <p>The city said the job centers were performing better than traditional welfare centers, and had improved their practices.</p>
        <p>But the judge ruled that because of the array of problems in the audit, ''it is difficult to trust any of the extrapolations made by the city defendants comparing the performance of job and income support centers, or assessing the performance of job centers over time.''</p>
        <p>''It is safe to conclude only that the centers' true performance figures are probably much different than those presented by the city,'' he said.</p>
