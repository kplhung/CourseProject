        <p>Much of the music world heads for the hills of New England during the summer, and so, in a Bach year, does Bach.</p>
        <p>Actually, he is a regular visitor, in concerts of the New England Bach Festival at Marlboro, Vt., among others. But the activity has stepped up markedly this year, the 250th anniversary of the composer's death, with events like the ''Bach 2K'' concerts this weekend at the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival.</p>
        <p>The first concert here, on Friday, offered the ''Brandenburg'' Concertos, with some performers (the Tokyo String Quartet) more surprising in this repertory than others (like the harpsichordist Kenneth Cooper). But alas, that enticing prospect conflicted with a Marlboro concert offering cantatas, as the Saturday concert here also did.</p>
        <p>The New England Bach Festival, in its 32nd year, was founded by Blanche Moyse, herself a venerable institution: a founder of the Marlboro Festival 50 years ago and a longtime Bach adept. On Friday she conducted the Blanche Moyse Chorale and the festival orchestra in three cantatas at the Persons Auditorium of Marlboro College.</p>
        <p>Or rather, she conducted when needed. In small-scale movements, involving a singer and continuo with, perhaps, an obbligato player, she sat and beamed on the performance.</p>
        <p>Yet as frail as she looked, there was no lack of vitality in the performances. Indeed, in the delightful duet ''Nun verschwinden alle Plagen'' (''Now all torments vanish'') from Cantata No. 32, ''Liebster Jesu, Mein Verlangen'' (''Dearest Jesus, My Desire''), her quick clip nearly outstripped the abilities of her talented fiddlers.</p>
        <p>The rich mix of cantatas ranged from the unfamiliar No. 60, ''O Ewigkeit, Du Donnerwort'' (''Eternity, Thou Thunderous Word''), with its inventive use of duets, to the famous No. 147, ''Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben'' (''Heart and Lips and Deed and Conduct''), with the ''Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring'' chorale descending twice. (Bach knew a good thing when he found it.) In addition, Steven Paul Spears, a tenor, sang the ''Benedictus'' from Bach's Mass in B minor, a bonus enhanced by the flute playing of Paula Robison.</p>
        <p>Hyunah Yu, a soprano, was the most impressive of the vocal soloists, with clear, secure tone. Randall Scarlata, a fine baritone, lacked the bass notes occasionally needed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moyse's chorus, 22 strong, achieved what good intentions could. The basic sonority is that of so many amateur groups: fuzzy and unfocused, with little core or bite.</p>
        <p>The Norfolk concert on Saturday avoided any such problem by having the four vocal soloists sing the choruses. There being only two choral movements, opening and closing Cantata No. 8, ''Liebster Gott, Wenn Werd Ich Sterben'' (''Dearest God, When Will I Die?''), this practice may well have been merely an economy of chamber scale.</p>
        <p>But it also carries the cachet of advanced musicological thinking; Joshua Rifkin and others maintain that Bach probably had only one voice per part in most of his own choral performances. In any case, it worked well enough here: remarkably so in view of the weakness of individual voices (including a veritable caricature of a countertenor), as revealed in solo numbers.</p>
        <p>By far the finest vocalist was Richard Lalli, a baritone, who also contributed the solo Cantata No. 82, ''Ich Habe Genug'' (''I Have Enough''). His approach seemed a bit dry and reserved at times in this warmest of outpourings, and the addition of ornaments in the repeat of the central aria ruffled the inherent serenity of this lullaby, but Mr. Lalli won the listener over in the end, rejoicing with Bach and the text at the prospect of death.</p>
        <p>The Norfolk concerts were dedicated to the memory of Ronald Roseman, an oboist and Bach specialist who worked at the festival for more than a quarter of a century before his death in February. Mr. Roseman took a hand in programming this death-haunted concert, Joan Panetti, the festival's director, said from the stage.</p>
        <p>Among other things, he quickly proposed ''Ich Habe Genug,'' as well he might have, with its prominent oboe solos in the first and last movements. As it was, Randall Wolfgang played them ably, and Jennifer Grim was a deft, smooth flute soloist in ''Liebster Gott.''</p>
        <p>The extras here were highly variable. David Connell, an organist, and a brass quintet offered three chorales to start, all well and good.</p>
        <p>Less to the point, the guitar virtuoso Eliot Fisk opened the second half with a lute prelude and his arrangement of the Chaconne from Bach's D minor Violin Partita. If the steady tread and the cumulative magnificence of that great movement can be achieved on the guitar, they were not apparent here.</p>
        <p>Another brass quintet, partly different (and sorely undercut by trombone playing woefully out of tune), performed a movement from ''The Art of Fugue'' and another chorale. And the sour notes extended to Ms. Panetti's introduction, with recourse to the hoary myths of these as last works and of dictation by the composer from his deathbed.</p>
        <p>Surely, the Bach year should be an occasion to dispel myths once and for all and set the record straight. Happily, a tool is readily at hand: Christoph Wolff's magisterial new biography, ''Johann Sebastian Bach: The Learned Musician.''</p>
