        <p>Craig O. McCaw has named Greg Clarke, left, a 42-year-old telecommunications and Internet services executive from Britain, to be chief executive of ICO-Teledesic Global Ltd., the holding company Mr. McCaw created recently to control his satellite ventures. Mr. Clarke was until recently chief executive of Cable and Wireless Communications, a subsidiary of Cable and Wireless P.L.C. In his new post, he will oversee putting together and marketing a venture that is years away from offering its first satellite-based phone and data services. ICO-Teledesic recently announced investments that will finance its development until the middle of next year, but still needs to raise billions of dollars more before it can launch the satellites needed to begin service.</p>
