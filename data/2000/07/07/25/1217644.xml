        <p>They may not patrol the outfield like Bernie Williams, or strike out batters, like Mariano Rivera. But the ticket agents at Yankee Stadium have some raw power of their own: their kiosks are often the first stop for fans who want to see their World Series winners in action.</p>
        <p>And as the Yankees have prospered in recent years as the dominant team in baseball, so have some of the ticket agents, according to prosecutors, who say agents capitalized on the huge demand for tickets to divert some to scalpers in return for bribes.</p>
        <p>As a result, at the most popular games -- including opening day and Old-Timers' Day -- the agents at the kiosks told fans that the games were sold out. But while many fans went home disappointed, others were able to buy tickets at four times the regular price from scalpers who hustled fans nearby.</p>
        <p>Because of the scheme, the ticket agents went home richer, Manhattan and state prosecutors said yesterday, one driving a BMW, another sinking money into a Hamptons beach house, even though they earned only about $30,000 a year in their jobs.  Prosecutors were unable to provide an estimate of the total amount of money involved.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors allege that seven ticket agents employed by the Yankees, and one who worked for the Mets, were involved in the scheme, in which they diverted blocks of tickets to scalpers.</p>
        <p>In some cases, $35 playoff tickets were scalped for $140, while $150 World Series tickets were scalped for $1,000, according to investigators, who said they posed as brokers and bought the tickets from agents involved in the scheme.</p>
        <p>''It's exactly the unholy, illegal alliance between box-office workers and unlicensed brokers which conspires to shut out the real fans from being able to get a ticket to a playoff game,'' Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, whose office worked with the Manhattan district attorney on the investigation, said in announcing the indictments at a news conference in Manhattan yesterday.  ''It doesn't matter how long fans wait on line or how many times they call. Thanks to bribery at the box office, the tickets are gone even before they go on sale.''</p>
        <p>Sixteen people have been indicted in the scheme, including eight unlicensed brokers and their associates. All were arrested in recent days, and 10 were picked up at Yankee Stadium on Sunday before and during the game, investigators said. Among the ticket agents arrested were the president and a senior officer of the ticket agents' union. There is no evidence that the union itself was involved in the scheme, investigators said.</p>
        <p>Those indicted were charged with commercial bribery, grand larceny and falsifying business records, and they all pleaded not guilty at their arraignments in Manhattan Criminal Court, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>Yankees and Mets officials, who said the teams were cooperating with the investigation, referred questions to Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' chief operating officer, Lonn Trost, said the team would overhaul its system of ticket sales.  ''We will be working internally, with professionals and with Ticketmaster, to make sure that fans are adequately protected,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Through the loosely organized scalping ring, which prosecutors say operated for at least five years, ticket agents sold thousands of tickets to unlicensed brokers in blocks under false group names.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors allege that Stephen Mootoo, 41, an unlicensed broker whom they identified as the ringleader, bribed one Yankees ticket agent to sell him blocks of season and partial-season tickets, which then guaranteed him a large number of tickets to scalp at the most popular games, including those against rivals like the Boston Red Sox and the Mets. His lawyer did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mootoo, of Manhattan, bought $300,000 in tickets, charging them to the credit cards of his girlfriend and others, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>In one case, a ticket agent sold 300 season tickets under the name of Linden's Cookies Inc., a company in Congers, N.Y., that bought no tickets and employs only 30 people. ''We could bring all of our families and we wouldn't need that many,'' said John Kramer, the company's sales manager.</p>
        <p>Three of the unlicensed brokers, known by the group involved in the scheme as the ''Three Amigos,'' worked out a deal with ticket agents that allowed them to return any tickets they could not scalp. As a result, tickets for games that were supposedly sold out ''magically'' appeared, said one person who was briefed by investigators.</p>
        <p>When asked yesterday about the difference between a reputable ticket broker and an unlicensed one, Daniel Castleman, chief of investigations for the Manhattan district attorney's office, said, ''Most reputable brokers work out of their office and not their station wagon.''</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said the investigation began a year ago after complaints from a fan, who before a game bought a ticket from a scalper who was selling them near one of the kiosks at Yankee Stadium. After the game, the fan went to a window to buy tickets for future games, and found that the ticket agent behind the window, James Hirsch, was the same man who had sold him a ticket just hours earlier, investigators said.</p>
        <p>The fan testified before a grand jury and made the jurors ''so angry'' about the scalping, said the person who was briefed by investigators.</p>
        <p>Bail for Mr. Hirsch, who was among those charged, was set at $25,000, prosecutors said. His lawyer could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors characterized the ticket agents as young and brazen, in some cases calling brokers to offer their services in diverting tickets for a price. They said some pulled in tens of thousands of dollars in profits through the scheme.</p>
        <p>Michael Handwerker, a lawyer representing one of the ticket agents, called the allegations ''overblown.''</p>
        <p>Why did Mr. Morgenthau handle a case involving Yankee Stadium, which is in the Bronx? He said yesterday that home plate at the stadium fell within his jurisdiction, because it is less than 500 yards from the water mark that divides the Bronx from Manhattan.</p>
