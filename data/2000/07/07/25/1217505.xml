        <p>Recently, an article in a newspaper stated that ''at least 60 million people visit Internet health sites each year.'' This is not entirely accurate. I visit Internet health sites 60 million times each year.</p>
        <p>Until the development of the Internet, I kept my unhealthy interest in check by limiting my medical library to a few essential texts. That's the same principle that keeps me from bringing a deluxe Whitman's sampler box into my house: I would eat it all in one sitting. But now, it is as if my computer were spewing mocha cremes at me.</p>

        <p>Recently, an article in a newspaper stated that ''at least 60 million people visit Internet health sites each year.'' This is not entirely accurate. I visit Internet health sites 60 million times each year.</p>
        <p>Until the development of the Internet, I kept my unhealthy interest in check by limiting my medical library to a few essential texts. That's the same principle that keeps me from bringing a deluxe Whitman's sampler box into my house: I would eat it all in one sitting. But now, it is as if my computer were spewing mocha cremes at me.</p>
        <p>On the Internet, the Wonderful World of Diseases -- a real Web site, found at www.diseaseworld.com -- is available 24 hours a day. With a few clicks, I arrived at my own escalating diagnoses for a hoarse voice, starting with seasonal allergies and moving quickly to hypothyroidism and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The more I read, it seems, the sicker I can get.</p>
        <p>Using Hegelian dialectics: thesis, antithesis, I-feel-sick, I decided to see if the Web could help me understand my case of Internet invalidism. So I typed ''hypochondria'' into a search engine and immediately found the Whiteley Index, a test for hypochondria. Here are some questions from the index and my answers.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you think there is something seriously wrong with your body?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, especially when I shop for bathing suits.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you worry about your health more than most people?</p>
        <p>A. Naturally; most people don't worry about my health at all.</p>
        <p>Q. If you feel ill and someone tells you that you are looking better, do you become annoyed?</p>
        <p>A. I wouldn't, but no one ever has.</p>
        <p>Q. If a disease is brought to your attention (through the radio, TV, newspapers or someone you know), do you worry about getting it yourself?</p>
        <p>A. I believe that a disease being brought to my attention is a sign that I already suffer from it.</p>
        <p>According to the index, I am not a hypochondriac, which raises the even more alarming possibility that I really am sick. For further treatment, I began surfing health sites and came up with this possible diagnosis: Internet addiction disorder. I could get online counseling to help cure it. But this seemed a little like getting advice on anger management from Bobby Knight.</p>
        <p>In fairness, the Internet has only exacerbated my problem, it did not create it. For that, I blame my childhood. Google and Excite might call themselves search engines, but they could never command enough gigabytes to match the knowledge of things that could go wrong that my beloved grandmother amassed in her 90 years. If you are raised hearing that the germs on everything you touch are ''going right to your brain,'' aren't you entitled to spend wads of time perusing brainnet.org?</p>
        <p>As with any malady, hypochondriacs supposedly find comfort knowing about celebrities who suffer from the same condition. At least all of the hypochondria Web sites I found had lists of famous people who were convinced that they were sick, including Proust, Poe, Tolstoy, Kafka and Darwin. Notice that all of these supposed hypochondriacs are dead. This brings to mind the chilling story of Moliere, which I also discovered on the Web. He was an actor as well as a playwright, and after writing the hypochondriac's manifesto, ''The Imaginary Invalid,'' he starred in the title role. It was a short run, however, because Moliere died the night of the fourth performance.</p>
        <p>It has been consoling to find out that many of my friends, instead of improving their well-being by, say, taking a walk, are sitting around looking up their ailments. One, who seems remarkably healthy (possibly because he treats his home as a Biosafety Level 4 containment site), does not search for symptoms; he looks up causes. He is a slave to the Environmental Protection Agency's Web site (www.epa.gov). He uses it to keep track of the chemical contaminates that, he is sure, are killing him. Another friend said that she stopped looking up her medical problems after she kept discovering that she was either pregnant, menopausal or had ovarian cancer. Instead, she has switched to hypochondria-by-proxy, spending hours on the Internet diagnosing deadly diseases of other people.</p>
        <p>E-mail messages have also made it possible to be a passive recipient of freshly minted medical discoveries. For example, I read that antiperspirants cause breast cancer by blocking the lymph nodes. Of course, I stopped using antiperspirant. After a few days, I came to believe that this information was being spread by the dry cleaners of America.</p>
        <p>Not knowing what to do, I asked a breast surgeon about it. She said that several patients had raised this issue, but that she could find nothing in the literature to support the thesis, and anyway, it did not make scientific sense. But what does she know? She is just a doctor, which means she is too busy to spend her entire day looking up medical information on the Web.</p>
