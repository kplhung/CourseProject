        <p>Bettina DeCaumette wanted the old red jukebox out of the bar, rejecting it in the process of ending one business and starting another. So her bartender and partner grabbed the box from the dusty corner where it had blared out tunes like Bing Crosby's ''Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral'' for at least three decades, gave it a shove, rolling it into a small pantry in the back.</p>
        <p>''When you're the hostess, you don't make your guests create the ambience,'' Mrs. DeCaumette said, putting on, instead, a CD called ''Chicago Blues.''</p>
        <p>Ten months after Tropical Storm Floyd flooded her out, Mrs. DeCaumette is back in business. But she is not operating her Palmyra Tea Room and Art Gallery, the eclectic restaurant and gathering place she ran in nearby Bound Brook for five years, until Floyd filled it with eight feet of water on Sept. 16.</p>
        <p>Because she has yet to find a suitable location to reopen the Palmyra in Bound Brook, about 35 miles southwest of Midtown Manhattan, she has become part owner of the Dunellen Hotel. The hotel is a careworn 14-room Victorian building on Washington Street here, just a few miles east of her old business.</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, Mrs. DeCaumette took over the restaurant and the Rathskeller bar in the hotel's basement, a neighborhood fixture since the mid-1930's.</p>
        <p>While the Dunellen is not the Palmyra, Mrs. DeCaumette is grateful to be back in business after months of indecision and financial worries.</p>
        <p>''I feel very fortunate because lots of people dream of owning their own place and never have the opportunity,'' she said recently as she presided over her small staff and a sparse lunchtime crowd in the bar. ''I believe it's better to go out and do something, anything, rather than do nothing.''</p>
        <p>Floyd caused more than $1 billion in damage in New Jersey and brought normal life to an abrupt standstill for those who lost homes and businesses. In Bound Brook, on the banks of the Raritan River, which spilled over during the storm, hundreds of small-business owners like Mrs. DeCaumette had to struggle to resume their livelihoods.</p>
        <p>A drive through the town shows that most businesses are up and running, but many storefronts are still empty or boarded up. And those who lived through the flood say the effects linger in ways that sometimes cannot be seen or measured. The town, for example, has been divided by a redevelopment plan. Hundreds of angry residents have filled borough council meetings to express their fears that the plan will require their homes to be condemned to make way for new construction.</p>
        <p>Town officials, residents and business owners who suffered losses have spent months lobbying the state and the federal governments for financial assistance, which has come slowly. Last month, Congress appropriated $30 million in emergency public works and economic development money to rebuild stricken New Jersey downtowns.</p>
        <p>This is in addition to money the state provided for grants to help individual business owners. Patricia Clark, the policy director for Somerset County, said her county received $5.7 million of that money, much of which is going to Bound Brook's business owners. So far, her office has taken grant applications from 287 businesses, and 257, including Mrs. DeCaumette's, have received them, she said. Mrs. DeCaumette was given $11,150 to get back on her feet, and  she may qualify for $2,800 more, Ms. Clark said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. DeCaumette was turned down for a $100,000 loan from the United States Small Business Administration. Even with her business closed and no cash coming in for the last few months, she still had to pay about $1,000 a month to creditors, including banks and vendors.</p>
        <p>She and her husband, Patrick, and daughter, Celia, survived financially by relying on savings and keeping their living expenses down. Mr. DeCaumette, who had helped with the Palmyra before September, took a job with the Bound Brook office of the Salvation Army, which is still helping flood victims to resettle.</p>
        <p>Mrs. DeCaumette said the family had gone through its modest savings and had since stopped eating out and traveling, as well as putting off almost all clothing purchases.</p>
        <p>The family has also been helped by friends and family. Mrs. DeCaumette's mother, Aud Frislid, who ran an antiques store two doors down from the Palmyra that was also shut by the flood, helps by taking care of Celia. During the last 10 months, she  also housed several of the Palmyra's employees, like Jim Brannon, who is now a bartender at the Rathskeller and part owner.</p>
        <p>Still, the flood put a strain on them all. Mrs. DeCaumette spent many sleepless nights worrying about how to restart her business and what would happen to her employees. She said she grappled with depression as she wondered how her family would survive financially. ''The emotional toll has been very high,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''It's all stressful right now, but we're starting a new business, so it's normal,'' she added. ''We just have to prioritize more carefully.''</p>
        <p>For a few months, she argued and fought with her old landlord, Phil Neri, who also owned the space Mrs. Frislid was leasing for the antiques business.</p>
        <p>In the end, mother and daughter decided to part company with Mr. Neri over disputes about the rent and repairs to the waterlogged storefront space.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Auslid, who lives in a Victorian house around the corner from the old tea room space on Hamilton Street, wants to restart her antiques business in her garage.</p>
        <p>As for the Palmyra, Mrs. DeCaumette said she still dreamed of reopening it, but had been distracted from her search for a new site by her involvement with the Dunellen.</p>
        <p>Mrs. DeCaumette owns 20 percent of the hotel and 80 percent of the restaurant and bar operation. Mr. Brannon, the bartender, will own 10 percent of the restaurant business. The hotel's majority owner is Evan Carzis, the DeCaumettes' landlord in another Bound Brook business, a spice and tea shop called the Woad and Madder. That shop, which was five months old when the floods came, has not reopened either. Mrs. DeCaumette is seeking the right time to resurrect the tea room.</p>
        <p>''We've done as much as we could with Palmyra,'' she said. ''Now we need to wait a little bit. We're watching the situation in Bound Brook very closely. Palmyra is still very much alive in our hearts.''</p>
        <p>To Mrs. Decaumette, the Palmyra was more than a business, and when it closed, she lost more than a way to making a living.</p>
        <p>She started the Palmyra as a small operation that grew to be a popular meeting place that was part salon, part art gallery and part performance space. It also had a bookstore and a restaurant that offered a Middle Eastern menu. Mrs. DeCaumette worked as the chef in the Palmyra's early days, and until the fall was still sometimes the hostess, depending on whether anyone in her staff of 15 was absent. She was there almost every day, arriving about 11 a.m. and not going home until 2 or 3 a.m., after closing and preparing for the next day.</p>
        <p>So in Dunellen, she's trying to revive an atmosphere as well as a business.</p>
        <p>Many of her old staff members are returning. In addition to Mr. Brannon, there is Margo Frak, 16, who had been a waiter at the Palmyra for only a few months before it was flooded. Ms. Frak, a high school student, walked into the Palmyra once with her art teachers and saw the antique furniture and the artworks on the walls. ''I said, 'This is cool,' '' Ms. Frak recalled. '' 'How can I get a job here?' '' Four weeks later, she was hired. Then came the flood.</p>
        <p>Another of Mrs. DeCaumette's waiters has been working as a reservations assistant at the Ryland Inn in nearby Whitewater, a business owned by friends, but she coming to work at the Dunellen next month. Mrs. DeCaumette's head chef, Kirsten Hansson, had been working at Trader Joe's, a specialty market, but this month began working at the Rathskeller.</p>
        <p>The Dunellen Hotel is strikingly different from the Palmyra. It had been run for 52 years by the same owner, Lawrence Kerwin, whose father owned it before him.</p>
        <p>The Rathskeller, with its dark stone walls and red checkerboard linoleum floors, had been something of a neighborhood bar for years, and Mr. Kerwin served light fare in addition to his chicken pot pie and carrot cake.</p>
        <p>It had a variety of loyal customers, from people who would plant themselves at the bar most of the afternoon to an after-church crowd on Sundays.</p>
        <p>Mrs. DeCaumette will give it something of her own twist, with new music and a menu that will continue to provide the usual bar fare, with gradual additions like a smoked trout salad and onion soup. But mostly, she wants it to remain a neighborhood gathering place.</p>
        <p>She marvels at finding herself running a bar in the basement of a rundown hotel built in 1869 in a little town called Dunellen.</p>
        <p>''I never in a million years thought this is where I was going to be a year after the flood,'' she said. ''That, on a daily basis, is hard to adjust to.''</p>
        <p>Still, she's finding out that while adversity can turn a life upside down, plenty of things that were issues before the flood remain issues after it.</p>
        <p>So when she was not working, she had time to think about her overstressed life and long hours, and she resolved to strike a better balance between work and family.</p>
        <p>''We're working hard for me to set boundaries for the well-being of my family, and my sanity too,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But, while she plans to take at least one day off in her new job, she has so far found herself working almost as many hours as she did at the Palmyra.</p>
        <p>Still, she strives for balance and keeps in mind the strange twists that life can bring.</p>
        <p>''You just have to be more accepting of the things you can't control and to really be open about where life takes you no matter how goal oriented you are,'' she said. ''You can't determine where you're going to be in five years or even six months. That's the big lesson.''</p>
        <p>After the Flood</p>
        <p>This is the last in a series of articles examining the rebuilding efforts by the owners of the Palmyra Tea Room and Art Gallery, who were among thousands of residents and business people in Bound Brook, N.J., whose lives were disrupted by Tropical Storm Floyd.</p>
