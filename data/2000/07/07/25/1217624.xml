        <p>Richard B. Cheney's personal cardiologist said last night that the man Gov. George W. Bush has apparently chosen to be his running mate was in good health and had no symptoms of heart disease.</p>
        <p>But in an interview, the physician, Dr. Jonathan Reiner of Washington, took issue with part of a statement released yesterday by a cardiac surgeon in Houston and friend of the Bush family.</p>
        <p>In the statement, the Houston surgeon, Dr. Denton A. Cooley, said, ''In a recent checkup by Dr. Reiner, he declared that Mr. Cheney is in good health with normal cardiac function.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Reiner said that Dr. Cooley had called ''about a week ago'' to discuss Mr. Cheney's medical history. Mr. Cheney has had three heart attacks but none since he underwent a quadruple coronary bypass operation in 1988. In the conversation, Dr. Reiner said he told Dr. Cooley that ''Mr. Cheney is in good health, leads a vigorous professional and recreational life.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Reiner said he ''did not characterize him as having normal cardiac function.''</p>
        <p>Heart attacks destroy muscle cells that cannot be replaced. The amount of heart function lost after an attack, or series of attacks, depends, in part, on how much heart muscle has been destroyed.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cooley said, ''I conveyed to Governor Bush that in my opinion Mr. Cheney's health problems in the past should not interfere with a strenuous political campaign.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Reiner said last night that Mr. Cheney could withstand a strenuous campaign, but he declined to provide details about Mr. Cheney's medical condition until he received permission. He said he expected such permission would be forthcoming if Mr. Bush named Mr. Cheney as his running mate.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cooley said he agreed to review Mr. Cheney's heart records after a call from former President George Bush ''and presumed approval of Gov. George W. Bush.'' Dr. Cooley did not say whether Mr. Cheney had given his permission.</p>
        <p>He did not say who authorized him to make statements about Dr. Reiner's recent examination and other aspects of Mr. Cheney's medical records.</p>
