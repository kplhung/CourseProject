        <p>Boris A. Berezovsky, the top Russian executive and onetime insider, who has denounced a Kremlin crackdown on rich businessmen, received a measure of vindication today when international auditors exonerated one of his companies in a long-running investigation into embezzlement and money laundering.</p>
        <p>But authorities here intend to press ahead with the investigation anyway, one of several that reflect an intensified scrutiny under President Vladimir V. Putin of the wealthy oligarchs that control much of the business in post-Soviet Russia.</p>
        <p>The case, which has been pursued by officials in Switzerland as well as Russia, centers on whether companies including the Swiss-based Forus Services embezzled at least $200 million from the Russian airline Aeroflot. Forus, a company Mr. Berezovsky helped found, hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to examine its transactions with Aeroflot.</p>
        <p>The auditor said today that it had found no evidence of an illegal funneling of funds to the Swiss company.</p>
        <p>A friend of former President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Berezovsky wielded tremendous influence in the Kremlin and boasted that he controlled decisions at high levels. But since Mr. Putin succeeded Mr. Yeltsin at the turn of the year, Mr. Berezovsky has been pushed out of decision making.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Berezovsky resigned from Parliament, forfeiting the immunity from prosecution the post provided. The step was interpreted as a final break with the new Russian leadership.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has brought some of the country's richest men under scrutiny, part of his campaign promise to loosen the grip of big business on government policy. He is scheduled to meet with a group of top Russian businessmen on Friday. Mr. Berezovsky is not on the list of those invited, according to the Interfax news agency.</p>
        <p>A special investigator, Nikolai Volkov, will travel to Switzerland on Wednesday to obtain documents on the case from Swiss authorities, Reuters reported. Last year, Swiss prosecutors raided the offices and froze bank accounts of Forus and another company linked to Mr. Berezovsky, Andava S.A., which have provided Aeroflot with cash management, loans and other financial services.</p>
        <p>Today, the Swiss high court rejected a request by Mr. Berezovsky's lawyers to unfreeze the companies' bank accounts, Reuters said.</p>
        <p>The Russian prosecutor's office has been investigating the case for more than a year. A criminal case against Mr. Berezovsky was opened under former Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, who sought to reduce his influence in government. The case was later closed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berezovsky has vast business holdings, though their size remains sketchy. Companies he controls own stakes in the Russian television channel ORT. He is also linked to the Sibneft oil company and owns a car dealership, Logovaz.</p>
