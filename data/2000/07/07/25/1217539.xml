        <p>A recent ruling by the World Trade Organization that upholds France's ban on Canadian asbestos imports has caught the attention of environmentalists and labor rights advocates, who say it indicates the global trade group may be growing more sensitive to their concerns.</p>
        <p>The ruling, which affirmed the validity of a French law prohibiting imports of hazardous materials, is also another blow to the global asbestos industry. Other W.T.O. members might now use the ruling as a precedent to justify similar bans.</p>
        <p>Asbestos, a fibrous mineral, was once widely used as insulation in buildings, but demand for it has shrunk drastically the last few decades because of scientific studies that show it causes cancer and other diseases.</p>
        <p>Severe restrictions on the use of asbestos have been in effect for years in the United States, where billions of dollars in health-related claims by workers exposed to asbestos have long clogged the court system. The European Union, following France's lead, is soon expected to outlaw asbestos.</p>
        <p>The ruling by a three-person W.T.O. dispute panel is the first time the Geneva-based trade group has upheld a member nation's trade restriction to protect human health.  ''It's about time that they supported common sense, not narrow-minded, short-term corporate interests,'' said Remi Parmentier, a spokesman for Greenpeace, the environmental activist organization. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions has also welcomed the W.T.O. asbestos ruling as a victory for worker safety.</p>
        <p>Both groups, which are prominent critics of the W.T.O., share concerns with a broad alliance of activists who disrupted the W.T.O.'s meeting last December in Seattle with demonstrations accusing the trade group of favoring business interests over the environment and workers' rights.</p>
        <p>The asbestos ruling is preliminary and still officially confidential, but word of its contents leaked out in June. The final ruling is expected next month or in September, after both sides submit their comments.</p>
        <p>W.T.O. officials have declined to comment on the asbestos ruling because it is not final. The Canadian and French missions to the W.T.O. have also declined to comment. But no interim ruling has ever been reversed in the trade group's five-year history, and it is expected to be confirmed.</p>
        <p>The asbestos case was filed two years ago by Canada on behalf of its mining and export industry against France, which had banned asbestos and asbestos products as hazardous to humans two years earlier. Canada has long been a leading exporter of  asbestos, most of it mined in Quebec.</p>
        <p>Canada had sent nearly 30,000 metric tons of asbestos yearly to France before the 1996 ban, said Denis Hamel, a spokesman for the Asbestos Institute, a Montreal-based trade group.</p>
        <p>In arguments at the W.T.O., the Canadians said newer, safer forms of asbestos did not release fibers into the air as older products did. They argued that France could have adopted controls less restrictive than a ban.</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether the W.T.O. ruling will lead to restrictions on asbestos by other member nations. Some of the initial approval of the ruling by W.T.O. critics has also tempered a bit.</p>
        <p>Lucien Royer, health and safety officer for the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, said the asbestos ruling provided little guidance to how the W.T.O. might rule in similar cases where the safety of an export is challenged because the trade group's dispute-resolution process is not public information.</p>
        <p>''How the panels select and incorporate information in these rulings is very, very murky,'' Mr. Royer said.</p>
        <p>Others said the ruling might actually be more confusing than helpful in resolving other trade disputes over health and environmental concerns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parmentier said it was ''too early to say whether this ruling will affect other cases or the E.U.'s precautionary principle.'' He was referring to the European Union's effort to establish a principle to justify bans on imports considered harmful to the environment or public health.</p>
        <p>The test of that principle has been at the center of the continuing trans-Atlantic trade fight over hormones in American beef.</p>
        <p>The trade organization has ruled that the beef is safe and the union's  ban is illegal. But the union says that its scientific studies establish that the beef represented enough danger to human health to warrant not complying with the organization's ruling.</p>
