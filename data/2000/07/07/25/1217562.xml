        <p>LET the bidding begin for the last freestanding properties on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>In the wake of the UBS agreement this month to buy the PaineWebber Group for $12 billion, executives of the few remaining independent financial services firms are worrying about being left alone at the dance. Yesterday, shares of the Bear Stearns Companies leaped 7.7 percent, to their highest level in almost two years, on an analyst's report that the firm might be for sale.</p>
        <p>Bear Stearns officials have not publicly announced an interest in selling the firm, and the analyst's report, which was published yesterday, said no deal appeared to be imminent. Neither James Cayne, the firm's chief executive, nor the author of the report, Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, responded to phone messages.</p>
        <p>Still, some traders and investors bought shares on the hope that the management of Bear Stearns would be willing to listen to offers. The firm's shares rose $3.6875, to $50, on the New York Stock Exchange. More than three million shares changed hands, about five times normal daily volume.</p>
        <p>''We think that it's a very cheap stock apart from whether there's a deal or not,'' said Larry Sondike, a portfolio manager with the Mutual Series funds in Short Hills, N.J. ''We think we're getting the possibility of consolidation for free.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sondike would not say whether the Mutual Series funds, formerly run by the activist investor Michael Price, had put any pressure on Bear Stearns management to improve returns on the firm's lagging stock. ''I trust that Bear Stearns management and board will do what's right for all Bear Stearns shareholders,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the report that set the fire under shares of Bear Stearns yesterday, Mr. Moszkowski broached the subject of a buyout, saying that Mr. Cayne seemed more receptive than ever to the idea. But he added that Mr. Cayne had thrown out a minimum purchase price of four times the firm's book value, the value of its assets minus liabilities.</p>
        <p>That amounts to about $120 a share, or about $19 billion, for a firm whose stock had not traded above $50 in almost two years. UBS snapped up PaineWebber for 3.5 times book value, and some boutique investment banks have sold for steeper prices.</p>
        <p>But some analysts said they doubted that Bear Stearns would command a premium like those even from a foreign bank seeking an instant presence on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>''When you're on the outside looking in and want to gain an investment-banking footprint, it gets you into the game but you're still a notch below'' the biggest investment banks like the Goldman Sachs Group, said Dean Eberling, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. ''Four times book is unrealistic.''</p>
        <p>Through the wave of mergers and buyouts that has swept the securities industry over the last several years, Bear Stearns has been viewed as an iconoclastic holdout. A midsize investment bank, it makes a lot of money in some businesses that other Wall Street firms shun. Most notable among them is the clearing, or processing, of trades for other, usually smaller, brokerage firms and hedge funds.</p>
        <p>Clearing is perennially profitable for Bear Stearns, which has one of the biggest clearing operations, but it has taken on more risk in recent years as regulators have sought to hold firms like Bear Stearns responsible for the actions of the small brokerage firms that make up their clearing clientele. Processing trades is also much less alluring than the high-fee investment banking practices of underwriting stocks of new companies and advising corporations on mergers and acquisitions.</p>
        <p>According to the report, Mr. Cayne ''believes strongly that the firm's biggest problem is its image.'' It alluded to the firm's role as clearing broker for A. R. Baron, a defunct brokerage firm that prosecutors charged with bilking investors, and a recent court order that the firm pay $111 million to a former customer.</p>
        <p>After that judgment reduced Bear Stearns's second-quarter earnings by $96 million, Mr. Eberling lowered his rating on the firm's stock from ''buy'' to ''market outperform.'' Mr. Eberling said he was troubled by the firm's plan to spend heavily to build its investment banking operation in Europe, years after its biggest Wall Street competitors had headed east.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moszkowski, in contrast, rates Bear Stearns a ''buy'' and says he expects its price to rise to $60 within a year.</p>
        <p>''It's worth far, far more than $50 a share,'' said Mr. Sondike, who manages the Mutual Shares fund and co-manages the Mutual Beacon fund. Together those funds own about four million shares, or about 1 percent of the firm.</p>
        <p>''Bear tends to really not get any respect,'' Mr. Sondike said. ''People erroneously tend to think it's a trading shop taking a lot of risk. These are smart, risk-averse, profit-seeking people.''</p>
        <p>He said he was also attracted by the high level of inside ownership of the firm. Mr. Cayne, he noted, owns about four million shares. Yesterday, the value of those shares rose nearly $15 million.</p>
