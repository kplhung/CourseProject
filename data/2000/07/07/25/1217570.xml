        <p>As much as anything in Deutsche Telekom's $50.7 billion offer for VoiceStream Wireless, the German concern is betting on John W. Stanton's legacy of building a wireless company with national reach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stanton, VoiceStream's chairman, is a former protege of Craig O.McCaw, the creator of the first nationwide cellular network, and his effort to transform VoiceStream from a relatively small, money-losing company into a national player will be a key factor in Deutsche Telekom's effort to expand in the United States as new wireless technologies come into play.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stanton's success in attracting a bid for his company that is nearly five times what AT&amp;T paid for McCaw Cellular Communications in 1994 has largely been based on going against the grain of wireless strategies championed by corporate giants like AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>By almost any measure, VoiceStream's short history is indicative of the window of opportunity in the wireless industry for executives who know how to leverage a company's strengths. In VoiceStream's case, its strengths had to do with a prescient bet made by Mr. Stanton on the importance of having enough space to grow.</p>
        <p>''About 30,000 people in the U.S. each day are getting a cell phone,'' said Mark Lowenstein, head of the wireless practice at the Yankee Group, a telecommunications research and consulting firm. ''Stanton's being rewarded for his opportunistic efforts to put the right pieces into place before this type of growth began to occur.''</p>
        <p>VoiceStream was cobbled together from a varied network of properties that, in a way, resembles a vast jigsaw puzzle. The formation was similar to McCaw Cellular's in the late 1980's and early 1990's, when Mr. Stanton was the company's chief operating officer and vice chairman. Only in VoiceStream's case, the growth was more mercurial.</p>
        <p>Until May of last year, the company did not even exist. That was when Mr. Stanton spun off digital properties he had begun acquiring since 1995 from Western Wireless, his other company, into VoiceStream. Mr. Stanton had formed Western Wireless in 1994 in Bellevue, Wash., his home city, by merging two other companies, Pacific Northwest Cellular and General Cellular.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stanton then embarked on an acquisition spree, buying the OmniPoint Corporation of Bethesda, Md., for $2 billion, and Aerial Communications of Chicago, for $3 billion. After a few months, VoiceStream nearly had the national reach to compete with companies like Verizon Wireless, the largest wireless carrier in the United States, and AT&amp;T Wireless.</p>
        <p>Although VoiceStream is only the nation's eighth-largest wireless carrier, with about 2.4 million subscribers, it has licenses to potentially provide service to about 70 percent of the population. Some of this reach came through its two takeovers last year, but a substantial part was generated by Mr. Stanton's acquisition of licenses since 1995.</p>
        <p>''He had the foresight to bid in auctions other people ignored,'' said Tom Alberg, a former executive at McCaw who worked with Mr. Stanton and now heads the Madrona Investment Group in Seattle. ''He excelled at all the details involved in planning strategy.''</p>
        <p>So it was no surprise when Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the world's largest telephone company, sought out VoiceStream with the intent of acquiring a minority stake. The Japanese company would have joined Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. of Hong Kong and Sonera of Finland as minority partners in VoiceStream.</p>
        <p>But it was Deutsche Telekom, second in size only to Nippon among the world's telephone companies, that succeeded in courting VoiceStream, despite the fact that it has yet to post a profit. VoiceStream lost $203 million in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Part of the allure of the company is its choice of technology. Unlike most other United States wireless carriers, which use standards like T.D.M.A., or Time Division Multiple Access, and C.D.M.A., or Code Division Multiple Access, VoiceStream operates under a standard called G.S.M., or Global System for Mobile communications.</p>
        <p>G.S.M. is the predominant standard in Europe, where wireless services provided by companies like Deutsche Telekom are more widespread than they are in this country. So, although G.S.M. operates on a different frequency in the United States, Deutsche Telekom will have an easier time integrating the company with its network in other countries.</p>
        <p>While the ability to provide subscribers with the opportunity to ''roam,'' or travel from one region or continent to another with the same cell phone, is undoubtedly important for the companies, their future clearly lies with next-generation wireless services.</p>
        <p>As the wireless Internet becomes more common, companies are scrambling to provide services beyond the bland applications now available, like receiving a stock quote or a short text message. Over the next year or two, faster, more visual applications are expected to come to the market.</p>
        <p>Companies like VoiceStream need additional spectrum that provide them with the bandwidth needed for such applications. Part of the deal with Deutsche Telekom would provide it with $5 billion to bid in coming spectrum auctions to be held by the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
        <p>VoiceStream still has gaps in its network in places like California and the Southeast, so resources from the Deutsche Telekom deal could also allow it to buy other companies with operations in those areas. Powertel Inc., which is based in West Point, Ga., has been mentioned as one takeover target.</p>
        <p>''We're looking at the jigsaw puzzle now on a broader basis,'' Mr. Stanton, who would head Deutsche Telekom's mobile operations in the United States, said in a telephone interview. ''I think the goal now is to be global and wireless.''</p>
