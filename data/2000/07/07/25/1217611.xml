        <p>Thanks to Tiger Woods, a ticket to the 2000 P.G.A. Championship will be one of golf's hottest items.</p>
        <p>Before Woods started making history, this year's P.G.A. Championship was in danger of being overshadowed by the other three majors. The Masters is the Masters. And both the United States Open and the British Open were held at two of golf's most fabled locations -- Pebble Beach, Calif., and St. Andrews, Scotland.</p>
        <p>But what happens at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Ky., from Aug. 17 to Aug. 20 will hold the attention of anyone interested in sports. After dominant victories at both the United States Open and the British Open, Woods can join Ben Hogan as the only other player to win three consecutive modern majors with a victory at Valhalla.</p>
        <p>You don't have to be a golf genius to like Woods's chances at Valhalla. He has won the last two major championships by a total of 23 strokes. Instead of watching the final round of both events to see if Woods would win, many people watched just to see how much he would win by.</p>
        <p>''He's thrown all these old myths out the window, that you can't physically train for golf, that you can't be strong or you are going to lose your touch,'' said Nick Faldo, a three-time British Open champion, who finished tied for 41st behind Woods, who won Sunday by eight strokes over Ernie Els and Thomas Bjorn. ''Through the 90's and through science, you can train for golf. The knowledge that I have after 25 years, you'd love to be starting again. If you are going to go out and beat Tiger, you have to be out there doing as much, if not more.''</p>
        <p>But Woods is special not only for his athleticism and work habits. He has a passion for his profession. He loves golf. He loves to practice. He loves to play tournaments. And he loves to win. After his triumph Sunday, someone asked Woods if he might grow tired of winning. Woods had to smile.</p>
        <p>''Uh-uh,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What great athlete gets tired of winning? They may grow tired of training, traveling, forcing their body to do things as they grow older. But who gets tired of winning?</p>
        <p>That's the problem facing Woods's competition. He is only 24 years old, and he is not going away any time soon. He will not grow bored with golf to pursue other interests, because golf is his main interest. And he is playing a sport that will allow him to perform at the highest level into his 40's, particularly considering how well he takes care of himself. Woods has won three of the last four majors, and 13 of his last 23 starts on the PGA Tour. If he wins the P.G.A. Championship, imagine the anticipation that will lead into next year's Masters, when he would be shooting for his fourth consecutive major.</p>
        <p>Woods's victory overshadowed another great champion, Karrie Webb, who won the United States Women's Open on Sunday, proving she is still the best player in women's golf. Webb has won three of the last four women's majors, and in Annika Sorenstam and Juli Inkster, Webb has two formidable rivals who will keep her from resting on her laurels.</p>
        <p>Woods, however, has no real rival, yet it does not seem to deter his drive. Those who fear that Woods's domination will be bad for golf should think again. The Boston Celtics won 11 championships in 13 years when Bill Russell played, and the National Basketball Association kept going strong. The Yankees have had several dominant runs during different decades, and they still call baseball the national pastime.</p>
        <p>Woods is great for golf, not only because he is attracting new fans, but because he is not distracted by the money or the fame. When Woods comes to a tournament, he comes to win. Playing an individual sport gives him the freedom to set his own schedule, to take time off when he needs it and to arrive at every tournament feeling as if he can perform his best.</p>
        <p>Asked what achievement had most surprised him since turning professional, Woods cited his consistency. He has only missed one cut in four years, or two cuts if you insist on counting the weather-delayed 1998 Pebble Beach tournament, when he elected not to return for the final round in August, six months after the tournament began.</p>
        <p>Other players realize that right now, Woods rules. Remember when the Detroit Pistons had the Jordan Rules, a series of defensive schemes designed to contain Michael Jordan? There are no Woods rules in golf. People have talked about Tiger-proofing courses, but the harder you make a golf course for Woods, the harder it is for everyone else. And by retooling his swing over the past several years, Woods now has the control to succeed on tight courses, the power to succeed on long courses, the short game to recover from bad shots.</p>
        <p>''What really stinks is that you can't control him,'' Paul Azinger said. ''In every other sport, you can control your opponent. Except this sport. You can only focus on your own game.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, Woods plans to remain focused. He is scheduled to play in the Buick Open in Michigan two weeks from now, followed by the P.G.A. Championship the next week.</p>
        <p>Until then, Woods can savor another milestone. And at age 24, his best may be yet to come.</p>
