      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>For the past two weeks, the Mannes College of Music has been presenting its second annual International Keyboard Institute and Festival, a series of lectures, master classes and concerts, directed by the pianist Jerome Rose. The final performance in the festival was a recital on Saturday evening by Anton Kuerti, a pianist who in recent seasons has been heard in New York mostly in chamber music and in an annual New Year's Eve marathon in which he plays all five Beethoven concertos with the Jupiter Symphony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuerti's passion is early Romantic music, and he has both the technique and the musicianship to make this familiar terrain sound fresh. He opened his program with Beethoven's Sonata No. 13 in E flat (Op. 27, No. 1), and took the suggestion in the work's subtitle -- Sonata Quasi una Fantasia -- at its word. It is a suggestion that forces a pianist to play an odd double game of adhering to the unambiguous demands of the composer's score while also giving the impression that the work is being imagined on the spot.</p>

        <p>For the past two weeks, the Mannes College of Music has been presenting its second annual International Keyboard Institute and Festival, a series of lectures, master classes and concerts, directed by the pianist Jerome Rose. The final performance in the festival was a recital on Saturday evening by Anton Kuerti, a pianist who in recent seasons has been heard in New York mostly in chamber music and in an annual New Year's Eve marathon in which he plays all five Beethoven concertos with the Jupiter Symphony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuerti's passion is early Romantic music, and he has both the technique and the musicianship to make this familiar terrain sound fresh. He opened his program with Beethoven's Sonata No. 13 in E flat (Op. 27, No. 1), and took the suggestion in the work's subtitle -- Sonata Quasi una Fantasia -- at its word. It is a suggestion that forces a pianist to play an odd double game of adhering to the unambiguous demands of the composer's score while also giving the impression that the work is being imagined on the spot.</p>
        <p>It is, in effect, an acting job, and Mr. Kuerti undertook it gracefully and without overstatement. His tempos in the opening Andante were casual enough to give the impression of a chord sequence being explored gingerly, and as this slow introduction gave way to the more forceful Allegro and the alternately lively and ruminative sections that follow, Mr. Kuerti expanded his palette. All told, he made the most of the work's inherent contrasts, giving equal weight to both brusque, full-bodied staccato chords and sweetly singing passages.</p>
        <p>The Beethoven shared the first half of the program with five of Schumann's ''Novelettes'' (Nos. 1, 2, 4, 7 and 8 from Op. 21). In these Mr. Kuerti's playing had a harder, more aggressive edge. There was much to admire in the speed and clarity with which he cut his way through the thickets of Schumann's writing. Still, there is something unfulfilling about pianists' tendency these days to play Schumann in a way that magnifies his fevered anxieties. Without question, those qualities drive much of his music. But there is poetry in it as well, and it is too often sacrificed for the sake of probing Schumann's psychological profile. Mr. Kuerti did not ignore the poetry entirely, but it was a decidedly subsidiary concern.</p>
        <p>After the intermission Mr. Kuerti played Schubert's Sonata in A (D. 959). The first movement was on the haphazard side, possibly because Mr. Kuerti was distracted by music from practice rooms near the Mannes auditorium. Once the offending students were asked to practice elsewhere, Mr. Kuerti settled into a reading that had an appealing warmth and playfulness.</p>
