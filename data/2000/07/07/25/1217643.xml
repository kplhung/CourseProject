        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In my psychiatric practice antidepressants have on occasion utterly transformed people's lives for the better; sometimes they have enabled people to more productively engage in psychotherapy. Yet, in my view they do pose risks, one of the most serious of which was neglected in the July 18 article. Antidepressants are often dispensed along with an ideology that can cast real-life struggles as ''a disease state.'' The biological reductionism that this reflects will certainly end up a sorry historical curiosity, but in the meantime some doctors are diverting people to a primrose path that leads away from facing existential issues that will unavoidably again come knocking at the door.</p>
