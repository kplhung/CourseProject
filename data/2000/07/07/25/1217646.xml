        <p>The T-shirt stretched over Glenallen Hill's muscular torso tightly, like a coat of paint, when he ambled into the Yankees' clubhouse this afternoon at the end of a workout, a wide weight belt wrapped around his waist.</p>
        <p>He is their designated hit man now, a specialist acquired to fill a very specific role: haunt left-handed pitchers. Hill is defensively challenged, he runs the way a man should run at age 35 and he provides little versatility. But the Yankees figure he can effectively accomplish his one task, and tonight, when he saw his first pitch as a Yankee since being acquired from the Chicago Cubs last week, Hill slammed a home run -- against a left-handed pitcher.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' Roger Clemens threw erratically over six innings, walking five, but was good enough to win his fifth consecutive decision, 4-3, against the Baltimore Orioles. The Yankees are 52-42, 10 games over .500 for the first time since May 19.</p>
        <p>The trade deadline is a week away, and most of the Yankees' shopping -- often left to the last minute -- is finished. They got the slugger they wanted in David Justice and a front-line pitcher in Denny Neagle. Jose Vizcaino gives them protection against the possibility that second baseman Chuck Knoblauch's throwing jitters will resurface. They seek a left fielder, and have talked extensively with the Montreal Expos about a deal for Rondell White, and more recently with the Orioles about B. J. Surhoff.</p>
        <p>And they have Hill to harass left-handed pitchers. From 1995 to 1999, Hill batted .320 against lefties, with 29 homers in 509 at-bats, while hitting .266 against right-handed pitchers. He will not get many chances against lefties, because there are few left-handers. The Yankees have played 94 games, and lefties have started just 25 of them.</p>
        <p>Hill got a rare opportunity tonight. The left-hander John Parrish made his major league debut for the Orioles and Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, used Hill as his designated hitter, batting cleanup, between Bernie Williams and Justice.</p>
        <p>Parrish, 22, appeared to surprise the Yankees in the first inning, which is not unusual. They were seeing the youngster for the first time, and besides a few words jotted in their scouting report, they really had no insight into how he pitched. Knoblauch watched a Parrish fastball whiz past him for a third strike to open the game, and Derek Jeter and Williams swung over curveballs. Parrish had struck out three All-Stars in his first inning in the big leagues and he jogged off the mound to cheers, the memory of a lifetime.</p>
        <p>But Parrish knew nothing about Hill, about how he mashes fastballs in the inner half of the strike zone, and it was Hill who added a dose of reality to Parrish's experience. Parrish tried firing a fastball with his first pitch of the second, armpit high. Hill redirected it, on a line, the sound of contact making clear to everyone that he had just slugged a homer, and he swaggered around the bases. ''It takes the edge off, when you do something to help the team,'' Hill said afterward.</p>
        <p>Torre said: ''He definitely has that ability. He's a threat.''</p>
        <p>That homer tied the score at 1-1, and when Hill laced a hard grounder past third baseman Ivanon Coffie in the next inning -- an error on Coffie -- Jeter scored and the Yankees led, 4-2.</p>
        <p>But Clemens threw 25 pitches in the first inning, 25 in the second, and continued to labor, allowing a run in the third inning and walking Baltimore's first two batters in the fourth inning before pitching out of trouble. The thought occurred to Torre that this was a game in which Clemens was able to draw on his recent success. If he had not put together the string of victories, if he had felt badly about himself and his stuff, then this was the type of night when he might have collapsed.</p>
        <p>Clemens pressed on into the sixth. He walked Will Clark -- whom he had nailed with a high fastball in the upper back in the second inning -- before Charles Johnson blooped a single. First and second and nobody out. Clemens stood behind the mound and drew a deep breath.</p>
        <p>Harold Baines popped to short center, before Clemens struck out Coffie. But Clemens's left quadriceps began to tighten, cramps beginning to overcome him. He walked Brady Anderson, filling the bases, then motioned catcher Jorge Posada to the mound, essentially to kill time. When Torre jogged to the mound with the trainer Steve Donohue, Clemens asked Torre to stay, to buy more time to rest.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't coming out of the game right there,'' Clemens said.</p>
        <p>Not with the bases loaded and two outs and the lead on the line. Clemens attacked the next hitter, Mike Bordick, with splitters, one splitter after another, until Bordick swung and missed and struck out. Clemens walked off the mound, pumping a fist.</p>
        <p>''He earned this one tonight,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>The game had not been over five minutes when Hill strolled out of the Yankees' clubhouse, headed for the weight room again.</p>
