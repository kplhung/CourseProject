        <p>You could scour the earth from Beaver Cleaver's hometown to this northern burg of 15,000, a pinprick on the vast shores of Europe's largest lake, and be hard put to find a more typical-looking housewife than Lena.</p>
        <p>Lena has two adorable little towheaded boys. She wears a loose cotton housewife's dress, properly mid-calf. She has an innocent young mother's face set in long honey-colored tresses and framed with an almost prim pair of glasses.</p>
        <p>Were it not for the still in her kitchen, you might not be surprised if Lena had the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.</p>
        <p>But to be perfectly frank about it, she is not even a good housekeeper. Lena is a bootlegger. She makes, bottles and sells illegal booze.</p>
        <p>When you sell up to 400 half-liter bottles of hooch every month, you do not have much time to keep house, not that anyone would want to visit. The living room is so redolent of eau de hooch that you could almost get tipsy just sitting there, provided you didn't choke first.</p>
        <p>But the aroma would never be mistaken for cologne. It could well be mistaken for the bag of kitchen scraps you forgot to dispose of before leaving on a two-week vacation.</p>
        <p>''It's a very simple recipe: sugar, yeast, water,'' Lena said as she chatted in her spectacularly cluttered living room, in a clapboard apartment house on what might be called Pitkyaranta's bad side. ''People come and make orders for weddings, birthday parties, funerals -- we had a lot of orders for the New Year's celebration. People know what I sell, and they know it's strong.''</p>
        <p>Such people do not seem to include the militia, which is supposed to arrest her, fine her and confiscate her still should they stumble across her enterprise. ''We know the stoolies who inform the police, and we just tell them 'No, we don't sell it,' '' Lena explained, as if that answered all questions.</p>
        <p>Though she told her story on condition that her last name not be used, this reporter nevertheless managed to find Lena by getting into a car, asking the driver where he could buy some hooch, and sitting back contentedly as he was driven there.</p>
        <p>Russians don't call it hooch, of course. They call it samogon, a piece of slang that literally translates as ''run by myself,'' which is just how the business is run.</p>
        <p>They make a lot of samogon in Pitkyaranta. In fact, a lot is made nearby. Lena's girlfriend, who lives upstairs, is a competitor. Across the courtyard, a maze of footpaths tramped through unmown weeds, another family sells bootleg vodka from another clapboard house.</p>
        <p>Why is a good question, seeing as Russia has no shortage of legal alcohol. Bootlegging is a risky business, and bad samogon has been known to kill people -- thousands, in fact.</p>
        <p>One reason may be that flouting the samogon law is an entrenched habit. Stephen White, a University of Glasgow scholar and author of the sad and fascinating book ''Russia Goes Dry'' (Cambridge University Press, 1996), suggests that the samogon craft gained in the mid-1980's,  during Mikhail S. Gorbachev's furious anti-alcohol campaign.</p>
        <p>Soviet authorities closed thousands of liquor stores and razed distilleries, breweries and vineyards, leaving truly dedicated drinkers scrambling for alternatives.</p>
        <p>People drank cologne and even brake fluid in search of refreshment. Air force pilots took to drinking the exceptionally pure alcohol used as a de-icer in MIG-25 jets, Mr. White noted, a practice so popular that the MIG-25 acquired the nickname ''the flying restaurant.''</p>
        <p>Some covered up their tippling by replacing the de-icer alcohol with water. This worked until their jets iced up in flight.</p>
        <p>Samogon, however, became the overwhelming choice of drink. Members of the Soviet militia made great shows of wrecking stills and hauling away bootleggers. But it eventually became clear that wiping out samogon would mean locking up much of the nation, including party officials and members of the All-Union Voluntary Society for the Struggle for Sobriety, the government's anti-booze organ.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the industrial-size packages of yeast Lena regularly buys contain instructions for making samogon, under the discreet heading ''A recipe for Russia's traditional national beverage.''</p>
        <p>Just before Communism collapsed in 1991, distilling samogon for home use became legal, and production skyrocketed again. That selling it was still illegal made little difference: by 1994, one in every six drinks downed in Russia was samogon.</p>
        <p>Add to that the fact that the Soviet Union's demise has left millions jobless and frantic for money, and it is not hard to see why bootlegging still thrives.</p>
        <p>Pitkyaranta, about 75 miles east of Finland on the glacial Lake Ladoga, was hit by Russia's economic woes. Until the local paper mill began cranking up to meet a growing export market a year ago, many were desperate. Lena's family was among them.</p>
        <p>''We moved here in '95 to this barracks of a house,'' she said. ''My husband worked on the railroad. We had our second kid, and in a year, the railroad shop shut down without any warning -- not even severance pay -- and my husband lost his job.</p>
        <p>''Here I was with two kids, 1 and 4, and no income. My husband found a job at the paper mill, but the pay was very bad. So I tried the shuttle trade -- go to Moscow; buy some goods; come back here and sell them. But then came the '98 crash, and I lost everything. We didn't have food -- just a pot of fried potatoes. My oldest son would say, 'Mama, is that for me?' and I'd have to tell him, 'No; it's for the whole family.' ''</p>
        <p>''And so I came to this business.''</p>
        <p>Lena's inspiration was across the courtyard, where bootleggers were buying pure alcohol, diluting it with water and selling it as vodka for 80 cents a bottle. ''But it was weak stuff, only 30 proof, and the quality was bad,'' she said. ''Sometimes they'd add sleeping pills, so it would knock you out quicker.''</p>
        <p>She figured she could do better. So she bought a small still -- a pot, roughly wastebasket-sized, with a curlicued pipe sprouting from the top -- and began making real samogon. Today an ordinary bottle sells for 80 cents, a bottle spiced up with a skin-peeling combination of herbs and orange peel, among other things, costs 90 cents.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important to her clientele, Lena's samogon is considerably stronger than the watered-down vodka across the way. She tested a batch for a visitor, using a thermometer-like device that floats at varying levels determined by the amount of alcohol, and announced proudly, ''Forty-six proof.''</p>
        <p>Word soon spread, and now Lena has a supplier of clear glass bottles and six distributors who take most of the orders in exchange for a small cut.</p>
        <p>In a good month, she takes in $325 or so. An average month's gross is closer to $225 -- a handsome income in a small Russian town, compared with her husband's $100.</p>
        <p>''I may take in 6,000 rubles,'' she says. ''A nurse makes 425.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the cost of raw materials must be deducted from that. Lena usually buys yeast and sugar with a wink and a nod from a grocer who can use the business himself.</p>
        <p>It takes more than six and a half pounds of sugar and three ounces of yeast to make a quart of samogon. The water, fortunately, is free, though Lena must pump it from a well a few hundred yards away. Her house has no running water.</p>
        <p>It does not take Julia Child to make samogon. Mostly, it takes patience. The stew of sugar and yeast, called braga, must sit and ferment for at least a week, changing from stomach-churning brown to crystal clarity, before it is ready for distilling.</p>
        <p>The still itself must be heated, to turn the braga to steam, and then cooled so that distilled samogon condenses and drips into a container.</p>
        <p>Lena takes a certain pride in her work, though she confesses that she does not particularly like it. She says she is assiduous about keeping the mixture clean, though one look at her kitchen would cast that into serious doubt.</p>
        <p>She says she will sell no samogon before its time. ''I don't want to poison anyone,'' she said. ''If we drink, we drink our own homemade stuff,'' Lena said.</p>
        <p>''But thank God,'' she added, ''we don't drink much.''</p>
