        <p>The dearth of office space in Manhattan sparked a cutthroat game of musical chairs earlier this month among some of the city's top corporations that stretched from Fifth Avenue to Times Square and will cost both the winners and the losers millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>When the music ended, it was clear that Arthur Andersen, the giant accounting company, would be bounced out of 14 floors at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, between 54th and 55th Streets, when its lease expired. With nowhere else to go, the company has been forced to begin negotiations with Boston Properties about taking an expensive 400,000 square feet in the developer's long-proposed 48-story Times Square Tower, on the south side of 42nd Street, between Seventh Avenue and Broadway.</p>
        <p>''Andersen was outraged,'' said one real estate executive who had been working with the accounting concern. ''They'd been a tenant for years. But the investment bankers probably gave the landlord the rent they wanted without quibbling.''</p>
        <p>Sanford C. Bernstein Inc., the money manager for wealthy clients that is displacing Arthur Andersen, won the game. But it will have to wait four years until Andersen moves out. In the meantime, Donald J. Trump, Bernstein's current landlord at the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue, wants to raise the rent from from $39 a square foot to $175 a square foot, or more than $27 million a year, when the company's lease expires in 15 months.</p>
        <p>The costly nature of the game, which also involved Alliance Capital and the Rockefeller Group Development Corporation, is only the latest illustration of an overheated real estate market, in which large blocks of prime office space have all but disappeared from the city's skyscrapers as vacancy rates have dropped to all-time lows: 2.4 percent in Midtown and 2.2 percent downtown, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
        <p>''It's really crazy out there,'' said Jonathan L. Mechanic, a real estate partner at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson. ''You need to be decisive in this market. If you're not, the space won't be there.''</p>
        <p>Only a few years ago, one of four floors sat vacant in Lower Manhattan, and Midtown was doing only slightly better. With a resurgent economy and little new construction, companies have gobbled up much of what is available. The average rent for first-class office space in Midtown has jumped to $52.42 a square foot and as much as $100 a square foot in the most desirable buildings.</p>
        <p>The competition for space has grown fierce. Earlier this year, iVillage Inc. thought it had a lease for 100,000 square feet at 1440 Broadway, near 40th Street. But at the last possible moment, Conde Nast jumped in, snatching the space away from the dot-com.</p>
        <p>Arthur Andersen's troubles began about three months ago, when the accounting company began debating whether to stay in what is known as the Alliance Capital Building, the 50-story tower on the Avenue of the Americas, or move to a new location. The Fisher real estate family, which owns the tower, asked the company to decide by June 15. Later, Andersen asked for an extension until June 30.</p>
        <p>But on June 20, Alliance Capital Management, an asset management company, announced that it was buying Sanford C. Bernstein for $3.5 billion. Bernstein had been negotiating a move to the old McGraw-Hill Building, a 54-story tower at 1251 Avenue of the Americas, between 49th and 50th Streets, which the Rockefeller Group owns. But Alliance Capital insisted that Sanford Bernstein move into its building and opened talks with the Fishers about taking over the Arthur Andersen space, executives on both sides of the talks said.</p>
        <p>''They were an eyelash away from finalizing the deal,'' said one executive at the Rockefeller Group. ''Then the Alliance merger came up.''</p>
        <p>The Fishers quickly negotiated the terms of a deal with Alliance Capital just in case Arthur Andersen decided to move out. ''June 30 came and went without a peep from Andersen,'' said one executive who works with the Fishers. ''We were shocked that anyone in this market would let a major block of space slip away.''</p>
        <p>But one person working with Arthur Andersen said the company felt spurned by its longtime landlord, who ''never even called'' before signing a deal with Alliance Capital.</p>
        <p>That forced Arthur Andersen to look at a costly alternative proposed by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the co-chairman of Boston Properties, who has long sought a tenant for the proposed Times Square Tower. Mr. Zuckerman, who is also the co-publisher of The Daily News, is building a tower for Ernst &amp; Young, another accounting concern, across the street at the southwest corner of 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue. Most real estate executives did not expect Mr. Zuckerman to find a tenant for the project, which sits over the subway and has relatively small floors. Andersen changed all that.</p>
        <p>Today, officials from Sanford Bernstein will meet with Mr. Trump to talk about extending their lease at the G.M. Building until Arthur Andersen moves out. ''We consider Sanford Bernstein a wonderful tenant,'' Mr. Trump said yesterday, ''but we'd get more rent if they left.''</p>
        <p>But Alliance Capital may not be willing to pay the price. ''I'm dubious about paying $175 a square foot,'' said Dave H. Williams, the chairman of Alliance Capital. ''We'll move to curbside if that's the choice.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 26, 2000, Wednesday  An article on Tuesday about a major accounting firm that lost its lease for prime Manhattan office space misspelled the firm's name in some copies. It is Arthur Andersen, not Anderson.</p>
