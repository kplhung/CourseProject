        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''More Extensive Test Needed for Colon Cancer, Studies Say'' (news article, July 20) points out that a colonoscopy, which Medicare and most insurers don't cover unless a patient is at high risk, can be costly. However, most people are unaware that if, at age 50, they have a colonoscopy and are given a clean bill of health, another colonoscopy is not needed for 5 to 10 years.</p>
        <p>Until insurers recognize that it is more cost effective to prevent colo rectal cancer, rather than to treat the disease, it is important to encourage not only colonoscopy but also all colorectal screening tests. Any screening is better than no screening at all.</p>
