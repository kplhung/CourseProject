        <p>New study finds people infected with Chlamydia pneumomiae bacterium seem four and a half times more likely to suffer first ischemic stroke than uninfected people; finds those with signs of recent infection are most at risk, but that people infected in past several years are also at higher risk (S)</p>

        <p>People infected with the bacterium, Chlamydia pneumomiae, appear four and a half times as likely to suffer a first is chemic stroke than uninfected people. The findings are reported in the July issue of the journal Stroke. Dr. Mitchell S. V. Elkind of Columbia University based the findings on a study of 89 stroke patients.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that people with signs of recent infection were the most at risk but that people who had been infected in the past several years were also at higher risk.</p>
        <p>The bacteria are not those that cause the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia, but instead affect the respiratory tract. Almost everyone is infected at one point or another. Researchers believe the bacteria may cause an inflammation that leads to stroke and heart attacks.</p>
