        <p>The Kmart Corporation, which named a new chief executive on June 1, is expected to announce bad news today.</p>
        <p>The retailer is expected to say that it is closing about 70 of its 2,400 stores, that it will lower second-quarter earnings expectations and that it will be taking a large write-off on inventories. According to Shawn Kahle, a company spokeswoman, ''Kmart can confirm that it will make an announcement relevant to the productivity of our stores, our inventory and our expectations for the quarter.''</p>
        <p>A Salomon Smith Barney report released yesterday predicted that Kmart earnings would decline 27.5 percent in part because of ''weak sales in softlines'' and a high level of markdowns on merchandise.</p>
        <p>''We would not be surprised to see an announcement of a disappointing second quarter,'' said Richard L. Church, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>In addition, it is not unusual for a company to use the occasion of a new chief executive as an opportunity to deliver bad news. The street had expected that Charles C. Conaway, 39, who succeeded Floyd Hall as chairman and chief executive of Kmart, might make such a move.</p>
        <p>The next question is whether store closings and inventory reductions will be enough to improve Kmart's bedraggled stock. Shares of Kmart fell 37.5 cents, to $7.0625, yesterday. The stock is down from a high of $10 in March and $16 a year ago.</p>
        <p>''If these announcements happen to be correct,'' said Kurt Barnard, the editor of Barnard Retail Trend Report, ''they would prove that Conaway is off to an excellent start. It shows a new breeze blowing through Kmart.''</p>
