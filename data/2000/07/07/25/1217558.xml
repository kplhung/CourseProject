        <p>Lance Armstrong celebrated his second successive Tour de France victory in ways expected -- a glass or two of Champagne, a party with hundreds of his closest friends and sponsors; and in ways unexpected -- with nine other cancer survivors, he signed the Paris Charter Against Cancer, an information service.</p>
        <p>The big question today is how long this annual celebration will continue.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to stop a lot earlier than people expect,'' the leader of the U.S. Postal Service team said even before he wrapped up his latest success. ''I don't want to stretch out my career. When it's time to stop, I'll know it, the people around me will know it, and I'll just go and quit.''</p>
        <p>Although the 28-year-old Armstrong has many peak years left in principle, he sounds dubious about trying to match the record of five Tour victories held by Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain, the dominant riders of the 1960's, 70's, 80's and 90's.</p>
        <p>For that matter, Greg LeMond, with three Tour victories, still outranks him among Americans. ''That's a great accomplishment,'' Armstrong said of LeMond's record, adding that it was no motivation to him to try to match him.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if I have the desire to try to win five because I now have a wonderful family that ultimately I want to spend a lot more time with,'' Armstrong said during the Tour.</p>
        <p>''It would be crazy for me to think I can win five in a row because there are many talented people in the sport. So that would mean that if I were to win five, I would have to do a total of seven or something like that. You can't win every year -- you have accidents or somebody comes along that's better than you.</p>
        <p>''If I have the motivation for all of those years, then I'll try to do it. The way I ride, the way I train and race, is based all on motivation and love of the sport. If I love the sport and love what I do for five more years, then I'll try. But I can't guarantee it. When you put so much into it, pack so much into it, I don't think it's good for longevity.''</p>
        <p>Longevity is a major concern in his recovery from cancer and his campaign, as head of a foundation, to increase awareness of the disease.</p>
        <p>''It's still my main objective,'' he said. ''I need to prove not only that I came back one time but that I'm surviving the illness for another year, for another five years, for however many years I can survive -- that's the issue I like to push forward.</p>
        <p>''Every year that I come back to the Tour de France is another year that I survived this illness.''</p>
        <p>He added that not finishing first would not discourage him. ''If I don't win next year, I think I'll still come back and try again the following year. That won't drive me from the sport.''</p>
        <p>Despite his domination, Armstrong still has room to grow stronger, said Chris Carmichael, his trainer for the last 10 years and a former rider himself.</p>
        <p>''He's about 2 percent stronger this year over last year, based on tests before the Tour,'' Carmichael said, ''but 2 percent is enormous.''</p>
        <p>Carmichael thought the Texan was 10 percent stronger now than before his testicular cancer was diagnosed in 1996. ''That doesn't sound very much, but it's an awful lot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Carmichael also tried to explain his protege's power in the mountains the last two years. Before then, Armstrong was not regarded as a leading climber.</p>
        <p>''They're all subtle things,'' he said. ''Now they look glaringly different, but they're really not. His pedal speed and things like that -- that's work that's been taking a long time to get to the point where he is now.''</p>
        <p>In the Alps and Pyrenees during the last two Tours, the Texan has been using a smaller gear and more pedal strokes a minute to push it than he did before. ''Most of it is between 85 to 90 revolutions per minute when he's climbing,'' Carmichael said, ''which is about 10 r.p.m. more than is traditional, what he used to do.''</p>
        <p>Armstrong, who said today that he would enter both the time trial and the road race at the Olympics in Sydney, Australia, in September, also credits his increased time spent training on the hills near his home in Nice and improved eating habits to bring his weight down to 73 kilograms (161 pounds) from 82 in 1996.</p>
        <p>''There are lots of tricks to losing weight,'' he said, including his occasional habit of weighing his portions down to the gram before they are cooked.</p>
        <p>So, after his autobiography was published this spring, will his next effort be ''The Lance Armstrong Diet Book''?</p>
        <p>''I don't think so,'' he said, laughing.</p>
