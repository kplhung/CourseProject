        <p>The number of adults under the supervision of federal, state and local correctional authorities rose nearly 3 percent last year to a record, the Department of Justice said.</p>
        <p>The Bureau of Justice Statistics said the number rose to 6,288,600, from 6,124,200 in 1998. The number, about 3 percent of all adults in the United States, includes those in jails and prisons and on probation and parole. Of that overall figure, more than four million were probation and parole cases.</p>
        <p>Alan Beck, the chief of correction statistics for the Justice Department, said the rate of growth for prison populations had slowed in the late 1990's. The percentage of the adult population under correctional supervision has tripled since 1980, he said. States have built more prisons, sentencing standards have toughened and more people are receiving community supervision.</p>
        <p>During the decade, there was roughly an annual 4 percent rise in the population under correctional supervision, more than 40 percent from 1990 to 1999. There were almost two  million more people under correctional supervision in 1999 than in 1990.</p>
        <p>Probation cases rose about 100,000, reflecting an increase in drug arrests, Mr. Beck said, but also -- in what may be a reversal of a long trend -- a decline in the number of drug offenders sent to prison.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beck said that probation cases had surged, even as violent crime had dropped, in part because more convictions for certain offenses, including drug possession, simple assault, drunk driving, fraud and embezzlement, had drawn probation instead of jail or prison time.</p>
        <p>Twenty-four percent of those on probation last year were convicted on drug offenses and 17 percent for drunken driving, the data indicated.</p>
        <p>California and Texas recorded the most adults on probation and parole, almost a quarter of the total. States with the largest percentage of adults on probation and parole were Georgia (5.8 percent) and Idaho (4.2 percent).</p>
        <p>Women represented 22 percent of all probation cases in 1999, up from 18 percent in 1990, and 12 percent of all parole cases, up from 8 percent.</p>
        <p>Sixty-three percent of the adults on probation last year were white, a decline from 68 percent in 1990. About 35 percent of adults on probation last year were black, compared with 31 percent in 1990.</p>
        <p>Parole cases, by race and sex, remained much the same from 1990 to 1999. White adults' percentage of those on parole cases rose to 55 percent, from 52 percent. The percentage of parolees who are black adults dropped to 44 percent, from 47 percent.</p>
