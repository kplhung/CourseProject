        <p>As Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush prepare to frame their messages at the national conventions, most Americans say they already perceive pronounced differences on how they would handle health care, taxes, the environment and the selection of Supreme Court justices, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll showed.</p>
        <p>For all the focus on how the candidates are dashing toward the center politically and in some cases sounding alike, more than 7 out of 10 Americans said there were genuine differences between them. More than half of the public thinks those contrasts are more about issues than about personal qualities.</p>
        <p>For instance, 58 percent of Americans said that if Mr. Gore was elected president, he would make health care more affordable for everyone; 36 percent said that of Mr. Bush. Forty-four percent said Mr. Bush would be more likely to reduce taxes; 25 percent said that of Mr. Gore. Seventy percent said Mr. Gore would be likely to make real progress in protecting the environment; 44 percent said that of Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The biggest split came over abortion. Sixty-two percent said Mr. Gore would probably pick Supreme Court justices who would vote to keep abortion legal; 43 percent said Mr. Bush would be unlikely to do so.</p>
        <p>While impressions of the candidates seemed to be taking shape, voters indicated that they were far from having made up their minds. Several signs, in fact, pointed to a competitive contest. About a third said they could switch their votes before Election Day. And significant portions of each candidate's supporters said they had reservations with their current favorite.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush continued to lead Mr. Gore among all registered voters, but his advantage was within the poll's margin of sampling error. In a two-person race, registered voters said they would back Mr. Bush over Mr. Gore by 46 percent to 40 percent. In a four-way race, with Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee, and Patrick J. Buchanan, the expected Reform Party nominee, Mr. Bush would draw 44 percent; Mr. Gore, 38 percent; Mr. Nader, 5 percent; and Mr. Buchanan, 3 percent.</p>
        <p>The nationwide telephone poll was taken Thursday through Sunday with 953 adults, including 743 registered voters. The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The margin of sampling error among registered voters is plus or minus four percentage points for each candidate.</p>
        <p>''The jury is still out with this campaign,'' Samuel Hathaway, 36, a poll respondent from Vancouver, Wash., said in a follow-up interview. Mr. Hathaway said he planned to vote for Mr. Gore but added that could change his mind.</p>
        <p>''I just want to hear more from the campaign itself,'' he said. ''Right now I usually vote Democratic. Al Gore has been around for eight years as vice president so I'm sure he knows how to do the job. But I also like the Reform Party, and I want to hear them out as well.''</p>
        <p>A poll respondent who backed Mr. Bush, Kay Wimberly, 47, also said her leanings are by no means irreversible.</p>
        <p>''The primary reason I might change my mind is because it's so early on in the campaign,'' said Ms. Wimberly, a graphic designer from La Crosse, Wis. ''A lot of things can come to the surface between now and then. The candidates will make their positions more well known as the election draws nearer. Education is an important issue to me and to the future of this country. I'm not entirely sold on Bush's position because I feel some of his claims are somewhat vague.''</p>
        <p>In another finding that carried significant implications in the battle for control of Congress as well as the presidential campaign, the poll found that the Republican Party had recovered from the negative image it had after the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.</p>
        <p>Yet a heartening sign for Mr. Gore as the candidates compete for independent and moderate voters is that the public's impression of Mr. Bush's ideology, while once equally divided between moderate and conservative, is increasingly conservative.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the perception of Mr. Gore is that he is becoming more moderate and less liberal.</p>
        <p>A majority of Americans, 54 percent, now hold a favorable opinion of the Republican Party. During the impeachment proceedings last year, only 33 percent held a positive view of the party. Democrats had hoped to use the Republicans' handling of impeachment as a campaign issue.</p>
        <p>The survey also underscored that critiques the Republicans and Democrats have made about their opponents may not be convincing.</p>
        <p>Efforts by Republicans to link Mr. Gore to the scandals of the Clinton administration do not seem to have worked. A plurality of voters said the November election was not about Mr. Clinton. And majorities gave Mr. Gore high marks for personal integrity and character -- something they never did for Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>The argument of many Democrats that Mr. Bush lacked sufficient command of issues did not seem to be working either. Despite Mr. Gore's eight years of involvement in policy at the White House, that has not convinced voters that he is any more prepared for the presidency.</p>
        <p>Sixty-six percent said Mr. Bush has strong qualities of leadership; 55 percent said that of Mr. Gore. More people think Mr. Gore understands the complicated problems a president has to deal with, but the difference was not especially significant. Eighty-four percent said Mr. Gore understands those problems; 73 percent said that about Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>And while even Mr. Bush has acknowledged that ''my foreign affairs experience is Mexico,'' voters said they have as much confidence in him as they do in Mr. Gore's ability to deal wisely with an international crisis. For both candidates, voters were roughly split in whether they were confident or uneasy about how they would handle foreign crises.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Bush's strengths is that people still see him as eminently likable, while one of Mr. Gore's best assets is that he is seen generally as being on the right side of issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush drew high marks for straight talk, leadership and trustworthiness, while Mr. Gore was viewed as caring more about the needs and problems of voters.</p>
        <p>In some areas, the differences were largely of degree. For instance, both men were seen by a majority of voters as pandering -- saying what they think voters want to hear. But Mr. Gore was viewed that way by a larger majority. Mr. Bush continued to be seen favorably by a majority of voters who have formed an opinion of him. Mr. Gore was seen equally favorably and unfavorably, but that was a small improvement from the primary season.</p>
        <p>While the Times/CBS Poll showed no appreciable tightening of the race, other national polls have shown that Mr. Gore has made some progress in reducing Mr. Bush's advantage. For example, the most recent Gallup Poll measured 48 percent for Mr. Bush and 46 percent for Mr. Gore. Earlier in July, the margin was 9 percentage points.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's supporters said they were marginally more certain about sticking with the vice president than Mr. Bush's backers were. But 4 in 10 of each candidate's supporters said they had reservations about their candidate. One bright spot for Mr. Gore was that he has made inroads in the Northeast since May, when the last Times/CBS poll was taken.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore cannot seem to shake a perception that he is the inevitable loser. Only 29 percent of the voters polled said they expected him to win, compared with 49 percent who said Mr. Bush would win.</p>
        <p>For all the differences between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore, the one issue on which the public sees them both as responsible is on the economy. Roughly three-quarters of Americans think either Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush would likely make sure that the country's economy remained hearty.</p>
        <p>The public continued to put health care, Social Security and Medicare at the top of the list of problems they wanted the next president and Congress to work on. Those issues are all viewed as Democratic strong points.</p>
        <p>But taxes, an issue Mr. Bush has championed for months, is beginning to make its way onto the public's list of most pressing concerns.</p>
        <p>While the survey found that the Republican Party had rebounded, Democrats also were held in high esteem, with 56 of those polled registering a favorable view of that party.</p>
        <p>More people said they would vote for the Democratic candidate for the House in their district than said they would vote for the Republican. But the spread -- 41 percent to 37 percent -- was well within the margin of error. And national polls cannot predict an election in an individual district. But they can provide some insight into the general trend.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Party continued to hold the advantage on many issues that voters said they were concerned about, including Social Security, making the tax system fair, improving education, providing affordable health care, protecting the environment and caring about the average person. The Republican strengths, according to those polled, are keeping the military potent and preserving family values.</p>
        <p>The two political parties that have not fared well are the Reform Party and Green Party. Both are seen negatively by most people. While poll respondents said they had a pretty good sense now of the parties and the candidates, several acknowledged that their views might change.</p>
        <p>Duane Taff, 33, a radio station music director in Grand Rapids, Mich., said he was leaning toward Mr. Gore. ''If there is an issue between now and November that I feel passionate about, I might go the other way,'' Mr. Taff said. ''Two months ago, an issue like that would have been gas prices, but that's starting to stabilize. Something like that might come up a week before the election. And if one of the candidates makes an effort, and I like his idea on it, I could easily go either way.''</p>
        <p>How the Poll Was Conducted</p>
        <p>The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Thursday through Sunday with 953 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 743 said they were registered to vote.</p>
        <p>The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.</p>
        <p>Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.</p>
        <p>The results have been weighted to account for household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.</p>
        <p>In theory, in 19 out of 20 cases, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.</p>
        <p>For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. For registered voters, for example, it is plus or minus four percentage points.</p>
        <p>In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of questions, for instance, may lead to somewhat different results.</p>
