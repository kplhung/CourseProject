        <p>Meeting Up With an Alter Ego</p>
        <p>It took 10 years, but TAMMY FAYE BAKKER MESSNER -- the former wife of JIM BAKKER, the television evangelist who was caught up in financial and sexual scandals in the 1980's -- finally met BERNADETTE PETERS. Couch potatoes will recall that Ms. Peters played Ms. Messner and KEVIN SPACEY played Mr. Bakker in the 1990 made-for-television movie ''Fall From Grace.''</p>
        <p>''I'm always afraid to meet famous people because you're afraid you're going to be disappointed,'' Ms. Messner said. ''I have met some famous people that I really loved until I met them.''</p>
        <p>Really. Who?</p>
        <p>''No, no, no, I won't tell you.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Peters was not a disappointment. ''She's just like I thought she would be, but sweeter,'' Ms. Messner said after a performance of ''Annie Get Your Gun'' and a backstage introduction the other night. ''I thought she did such a wonderful portrayal of me. I know she did her homework.</p>
        <p>''The man who portrayed Jim did a lousy job. He did not have Jim down at all. Jim is not one to yell and scream and get all emotional. He's quiet and pensive. I felt like he did not study Jim.''</p>
        <p>A Songwriter's Cheat Sheet</p>
        <p>BILLY JOEL kept a songbook in front of him during a master class at Southampton High School on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''I've written, like, 200 songs, and you start to forget some lyrics,'' he said. The songbook, he said, was ''kind of like Linus's blanket,'' there for security.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to read the lyrics,'' he said. ''They are just going to be near me.''</p>
        <p>Then he brought out HYUANG-KI JOO, who played some of Mr. Joel's new classical compositions. ''He's very helpful to me,'' Mr. Joel said. ''Sometimes I'll write something and he'll go, 'You can't do that, that's Chopin.' I'll say, 'I'm writing Chopin?' ''</p>
        <p>Not when Mr. Joo hears a different composer. ''I'm working on something recently and he says, 'You can't do that, that's Ravel,' '' Mr. Joel said. ''And I say, 'Now I'm writing Ravel. I'm really getting good.' ''</p>
        <p>It turns out that the piano man has a favorite piano at home. ''The piano I like to play is the Model B, the seven-foot Steinway, which is a really good piano for consistency,'' Mr. Joel told CHEVY CHASE. ''The other piano is a nine-footer, a concert grand. It's black and it's got keys.''</p>
        <p>Royal Ogling</p>
        <p>PRINCE ALBERT of Monaco tossed the first ball on Saturday to open the season at the Bridgehampton Polo Club. But it wasn't the horses thundering down the field that the 42-year-old bachelor was focusing on.</p>
        <p>''I just met KATE CAPSHAW,'' he said. ''I enjoy meeting stars no matter what their field. I'm not blase by any means.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Capshaw, wearing a white tank top, sky blue slacks and a rumpled sun hat, was chatting a few feet away with STAR JONES of the ABC-TV daytime talk show ''The View.''</p>
        <p>''Oooohhh, he's so charming,'' Ms. Capshaw said of the prince. ''I have a great deal of respect for positions that have titles. They are a blessing but they are also hard work.''</p>
        <p>But back to the prince: Ms. Capshaw is married, Your Highness.</p>
        <p>''I met Miss U.S.A. also,'' he said. ''Very nice. I'm meeting a lot of attractive women.''</p>
        <p>JOY BEHAR, one of Ms. Jones's colleagues on ''The View''; the actress DREA DE MATTEO of ''The Sopranos''; and the singer and songwriter DENISE RICH were also in Prince Albert's tent, and there were 1,200 more guests in an adjacent tent, including the designer BETSEY JOHNSON and the actor LUKE PERRY.</p>
        <p>''The Hamptons are great,'' Prince Albert said, comparing it with his kingdom. ''It's kind of a different environment in terms of terrain, but you meet some of the same people.''</p>
