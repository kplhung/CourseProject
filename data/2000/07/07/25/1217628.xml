        <p>Just as suddenly as he erupted in fury at an umpire, Carl Everett yesterday surprisingly dropped his appeal of a 10-game suspension and a $5,000 fine for his actions toward the umpire. Everett, the center fielder for the Boston Red Sox, began his suspension last night with the game against Minnesota and will be eligible to return against Kansas City on Aug. 4.</p>
        <p>Union and management lawyers had been talking about Aug. 4 as the date for a hearing on Everett's appeal.</p>
        <p>He indicated he did not want to prolong the matter, but he has been bothered by a sore right hand, which he apparently injured when he punched a bat rack after he was ejected from a game with the Mets on July 15.</p>
        <p>Frank Robinson, baseball's vice president for on-field operations, announced the suspension and fine last Thursday. He penalized Everett for ''excessive arguing, using foul language and making contact with an umpire on two occasions'' during the game with the Mets.</p>
        <p>With Everett at bat, the home-plate umpire, Ron Kulpa, advised him that he was standing too close to the plate. The rule book stipulates that six inches separate the plate from the batter's box. Kulpa even drew a line with his foot indicating the end of the box, and Everett exploded.</p>
        <p>After Kulpa ejected him, Everett bumped the umpire with his body, then flung his batting helmet to the ground and bumped him again, this time with his face. The second contact sent Kulpa staggering.</p>
        <p>Everett is hitting .316 and leads the Red Sox with 75 runs batted in and 26 home runs, and the Red Sox will be at an offensive disadvantage without him. He will miss three games at home against the Twins, four games in Oakland and three games in Seattle.</p>
        <p>Seattle leads the American League West with the second-best won-loss record in the league, and Oakland is the leader for the wild-card spot in the playoffs. The Red Sox entered last night a game behind the Athletics in the wild-card race and a game behind the Yankees in the A.L. East.</p>
        <p>According to a person with knowledge of Robinson's deliberations on the Everett penalty, he had considered making the suspension longer, perhaps 12 games. But lawyers urged him to keep it at 10, feeling that that length would be less susceptible to an arbitrator's reduction.</p>
