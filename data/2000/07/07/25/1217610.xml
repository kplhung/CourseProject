        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>BUCHANAN IS CHALLENGED ON BALLOTS  John Hagelin said yesterday that Patrick J. Buchanan, his rival for the Reform Party's presidential nomination, should be disqualified from running because he appeared to have committed ''massive election fraud'' in seeking voter support. Mr. Hagelin said his rival's campaign ignored party rules in acquiring primary ballots for non-party members. The list of names that Mr. Buchanan came up with was far too large, he said -- 262,314 Republicans in 10 states. Mr. Hagelin said he came up with 9,169 names for those states. Party rules permit candidates to request ballots for supporters but require that nonparty members initiate the requests. Mr. Hagelin accused Mr. Buchanan of stretching that provision. Mr. Buchanan's campaign countered that it had worked with the party's nominating committee to ensure compliance with the rules.</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>SURVEYS OFFER MIXED RESULTS  Gov. George W. Bush continues to lead Vice President Al Gore in a pair of new Research 2000 presidential preference polls from Washington State and Idaho and in an Opinion Dynamics poll from Ohio. But Mr. Gore remains ahead in a new Research 2000 poll from California. In Washington, the new poll, covering 605 voters between July 7 and 10 with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, gives Mr. Bush 43 percent to 39 percent for Mr. Gore, with Ralph Nader at 7 percent and Patrick J. Buchanan at 2 percent. The Idaho poll, of 601 voters from July 5 to 8 with a margin of sampling error of four percentage points, has Mr. Bush still ahead of Mr. Gore 57 percent to 21 percent, with Mr. Buchanan at 4 percent and Mr. Nader at 2 percent. In the Ohio poll, covering 501 registered voters on July 19 and 20 with a margin of sampling error of four percentage points, Mr. Bush leads Mr. Gore 43 percent to 34 percent, with Mr. Nader at 6 percent and Mr. Buchanan at 5 percent. The poll in California surveyed 827 voters from July 17 to 19, with a margin of sampling error of 3.5 percent, and has Mr. Gore ahead of Mr. Bush 44 percent to 37 percent; Mr. Nader draws 8 percent and Mr. Buchanan 2 percent.</p>

        <p>SUPPORT FOR GUN CONTROL  Handgun Control Inc., a nonprofit group that advocates gun control, released a poll yesterday showing that voters strongly favor toughening the nation's gun laws and would be more likely to vote for candidates who support such laws. The poll, conducted by Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, found that roughly 6 of 10 voters strongly favor licensing handgun owners, selling guns with safety locks and requiring buyers at gun shows to undergo background checks.</p>
