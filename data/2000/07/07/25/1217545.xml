        <p>R. Patrick Thompson, the president of the New York Mercantile Exchange since 1989, died Wednesday in Bethesda, Md. He was 51 and lived in New Rochelle, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The cause was a heart attack, the exchange reported.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson spent 20 years at the exchange as a trader or executive. He became president in 1989 after serving as a vice president, senior vice president and general counsel.</p>
        <p>During his tenure as president, the exchange firmed its position as a world leader in energy futures and options trading. It took over the Commodity Exchange, a New York-based metals futures market, and started electronic after-hours trading at a new headquarters in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson was born in Washington and graduated from St. Joseph's College in Philadelphia in 1971 and from the Catholic University law school in 1975. Before he became a trader on the Mercantile Exchange floor he worked for the enforcement division of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a supervisory lawyer in New York and as a trial lawyer in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson is survived by his wife, Debra; a son, David, of Hoboken, N.J.; three daughters, Aimie Zinzi and Sarah, both of suburban Baltimore, and Jacqueline, of New Rochelle; his mother, Mary, and a brother, Michael, both of Bethesda.</p>
