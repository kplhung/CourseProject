        <p>Following are excerpts from an interview President Clinton gave to Justice Department investigators in a campaign finance inquiry in April. The president was asked about conversations with an Indonesian businessman and campaign contributor, James T. Riady, who gave $100,000 to a close friend of Mr. Clinton, Webster L. Hubbell.</p>
        <p>Q.: Do you recall the car ride that you had with Mr. Riady on Aug. 14 of 1992?</p>
        <p>A.: Not specifically. I do remember though that I saw him sometime in 1992 and that he wanted to help. But I don't remember anything about the car ride. . . .</p>
        <p>Q.: Whether it's in the car ride or sometime else in '92, do you have a specific recollection about James Riady pledging $1 million to your campaign?</p>
        <p>A.: I don't. I don't. And I don't know whether he ever gave that much money. My recollection is I hadn't seen him in a while. We had a nice little reunion, and he said he was going to help us. I don't remember what the specific dollar was.</p>
        <p>Q.: As candidate Clinton in August of 1992, an offer of $1 million would have been something that was of some interest to you ----</p>
        <p>A.: Yeah, if he said that, I'm surprised I don't remember it. I mean, but I, I ----. You asked me what I remember. I can't remember any specific thing. I know that I saw him sometime in '92 after I became the nominee, and I know he said he was going to help us. If he said he was going to give us $1 million, which he might have done, I just don't remember it.</p>
        <p>Sometimes people give that much money. I know in an election or two ago that one of the Republicans got that much money from one source. So, it happens from time to time and it's not unlawful. But I, I just don't remember.</p>
        <p>Q.: Mr. James Riady is someone whom you have described up until this point as being not necessarily significant in any of your prior campaigns. So, that same person offering you, pledging to you to raise $1 million might have been startling to you in August of 1992.</p>
        <p>A.: Well, I ----. Yeah, it would. That's why I'm surprised, if he said a million, I'm surprised I don't remember it. But all I can tell you is what I remember. But it wouldn't have surprised me that they could have given that much money. I knew they had that kind of, that, you know, they were wealthy. I knew they had big business interests in America and, of course, you know under the Campaign Finance Law an American subsidiary, people associated with that foreign operation, or a citizen of another country that has legal immigrant status here can contribute. So, he would certainly have the capacity to do it. That wouldn't surprise me. But I ----. If he did say it, it surprises me that I don't remember because it's the sort of thing you'd remember.</p>
        <p>Q.: Mr. Riady has described that limousine ride to another person and narrates that, in fact, he made that pledge to you and that you were taken aback.</p>
        <p>A.: I certainly wouldn't dispute his memory of it. All I can tell you is that I don't remember it. But I know that he wanted to help the campaign and that he wanted to be generous and he ----. And like I said, any amount of money he wanted to give, I wouldn't ---- his capacity to give it wouldn't surprise me. And I know he did give us quite a bit of money. . . .</p>
        <p>Q.: On June 27, a Riady-controlled entity paid Webster Hubbell $100,000. The previous weekend, June 23, WAVE records reflect that Mr. Riady met with you in the White House. Do you have any recollection of a conversation with Mr. Riady concerning Webster Hubbell in the days before a Riady-controlled entity paid him $100,000?</p>
        <p>A.: No, sir, I don't. You know, let me just say this. It's possible that he could have said to me, ''I'm going to help Webb Hubbell, you know, I know Webb Hubbell and I want to try to help him, because everybody knew that I knew him well, that he had been here working.''</p>
        <p>And so if, in fact, I did meet with him then, if that, in fact, did happen, and if ----. But I don't remember it, but might have met with him.</p>
        <p>If, in fact, I met with him it wouldn't surprise me if he'd said that, something like that in passing. But I do not remember him doing that. . . .</p>
        <p>Q.: Do you have any memory of a conversation with Mr. Riady about paying Mr. Hubbell because of concerns that Mr. Hubbell might end up being a witness against you in some fashion?</p>
        <p>A.: Absolutely not. I never talked to anybody about that.</p>
        <p>I want you to understand two things. No. 1, I believe the people that helped Webb Hubbell did it because, like me, they believed he was innocent.</p>
        <p>No. 2, I believe Webb Hubbell was persistently persecuted by the independent counsel because he would not lie about me or Hillary. He did not know anything to testify against me or Hillary because, as the R.T.C. report made clear, we did not do anything wrong. And everybody with any oversight or awareness of the facts of Whitewater has known that for years. This is a ----. There is nothing to this. I never worried about what Webb Hubbell would say. If he wanted to say something bad about me, he'd have to make it up.</p>
        <p>Q.: So, you didn't have a conversation ----.</p>
        <p>A.: Now, that would have made Mr. Starr happy. But he did not know anything. The man has been punished more than he otherwise would have because he would not lie, not because I had any role in getting him any business contract.</p>
        <p>Q.: So, you didn't have the conversation?</p>
        <p>A.: No. I never ----. It never even occurred to me. It never occurred to me that he would be asked to be a witness. He didn't know anything. There was nothing to Whitewater. He didn't know anything to testify against me for. It never happened.</p>
