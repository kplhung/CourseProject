        <p>In the seven years since he took over, Louis V. Gerstner Jr. has led a striking revival in the fortunes of I.B.M., the world's largest computer company. Yet Mr. Gerstner, the chairman and chief executive, has decided that what the company most needs now is a good shake-up -- to accelerate its growth and achieve its goal of being the leading supplier of technology and services for the Internet economy.</p>
        <p>So the International Business Machines Corporation announced a sweeping management overhaul today that includes the elevating of Samuel J. Palmisano, a senior vice president, to become president and chief operating officer.</p>
        <p>The move clearly seems to make Mr. Palmisano, 48, the heir apparent to Mr. Gerstner, who is 58. Mr. Gerstner, who joined I.B.M. in 1993, when the company was reeling, has an employment contract that calls for him to remain in charge ''at least until he turns 60 years of age,'' or until March 2002.</p>
        <p>In a lengthy interview at the company's Westchester County headquarters here, Mr. Gerstner acknowledged that the announcement was certain to focus attention on the question of succession at I.B.M. But he noted that the elevation of Mr. Palmisano was one of several promotions of younger executives as part of the reorganization.</p>
        <p>''A new generation of leaders is starting to emerge at I.B.M.,'' Mr. Gerstner said. ''And certainly Sam is part of that, but so are a lot of other people here.''</p>
        <p>Besides, Mr. Gerstner noted, he has no intention of stepping down anytime soon. ''I'm still here,'' he said. ''I'm not going anywhere, and my job hasn't changed. And the board has not chosen my successor as C.E.O.''</p>
        <p>''There's not a lot you should read into this about me leaving,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Also today, I.B.M. named John M. Thompson, another senior vice president, to become vice chairman. Under the new setup, Mr. Thompson will guide the company's efforts in such promising new areas of growth as wireless communication, network storage systems, life sciences and Internet software.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Thompson is 57 and, given the I.B.M. tradition of having senior executives retire around 60, he seems to be a less likely successor to Mr. Gerstner than Mr. Palmisano. Mr. Gerstner praised Mr. Thompson as ''a rare talent,'' and gifted manager of technical workers.</p>
        <p>The company also promoted five other executives, all in their 40's.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Thompson focuses on the future, Mr. Palmisano will be in charge of daily operations in all the company's product and service businesses. In an e-mail memo to I.B.M.'s senior management team today, Mr. Gerstner wrote of Mr. Palmisano, ''Sam has consistently demonstrated the aptitude perhaps most critical to leadership success: He sets tough targets and then meets them.''</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Gerstner said that the reorganization had less to do with executive succession than with retooling the company's management structure to execute its Internet strategy more effectively.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the lingering question about the transformation at I.B.M. under Mr. Gerstner's leadership is whether, despite all the progress to date, the company is moving into that future quickly enough to offset the decline in some of its traditional businesses, like mainframe computers.</p>
        <p>In its second-quarter financial results, reported last week, I.B.M. surpassed the earnings estimates of Wall Street analysts, but its revenue declined.</p>
        <p>For the I.B.M. success story to be complete, it must deliver growing sales. The key to I.B.M.'s future as an investment, said Steven Milunovich, a Merrill Lynch analyst, writing in a bulletin to the firm's clients last week, is ''figuring out if I.B.M. is a new-technology or an old-technology stock,'' and adding, ''It's some of both now.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Gerstner's view, the table is set for growth at I.B.M., based on its strategy of being a leading supplier to companies trying to make the transition to e-commerce.</p>
        <p>In the second quarter, Mr. Gerstner noted that revenue for its e-business consulting grew 78 percent, that its specialized microchips for cellular phones and other wireless communications are sold out, and that it is straining to keep up with demand for the big hub computers, called servers, that shuttle data from and to Web sites.</p>
        <p>The company's e-business strategy, set in place over the last few years, is working as planned, Mr. Gerstner said. ''The business is exploding underneath us,'' he said. ''And we need to have a very, very focused execution capability within the company.''</p>
        <p>He called today's announcement the ''third turn of the wheel'' in terms of corporate strategy since he took over in 1993. The first stage he characterized as survival, and the second involved putting the e-business strategy in place. The third, he said, is the execution stage. Mr. Gerstner, once a partner at the consultant McKinsey &amp; Company, said that one of the most important lessons he learned there was the crucial ''linkage between structure and strategy, and that you really don't implement an effective strategy without a structure that reinforces and complements that strategy.''</p>
        <p>Yet the shake-up, Mr. Gerstner says, was also influenced in part by an instinctive belief of his about corporate management.</p>
        <p>''I am a big believer in forcing change on large institutions just for the sake of forcing change,'' he said. ''The longer an organization stays intact, the less successful it is.</p>
        <p>''I've been absolutely convinced that you've got to blow things up and start over again every few years, and that puts a whole new face on people's jobs. It gets people focused externally rather than internally.''</p>
        <p>The management organization, he said, is intended to ''sharply delineate'' the two major tasks facing I.B.M.: ''the execution of today's e-business strategy, which will be led by Sam Palmisano, and that development -- the rapid development -- of the new e-business world that John Thompson will lead.''</p>
        <p>Shortly after he joined I.B.M., Mr. Gerstner said that the company, given its dire straits, did not need a grand technology vision for its future -- a comment that brought criticism and ridicule from industry analysts. He said he had been widely misquoted, and what he had tried to emphasize then was that I.B.M. most needed to right itself before gazing toward the horizon.</p>
        <p>But there seemed to be plenty of talk about vision at the top today. Mr. Gerstner spoke of Mr. Thompson's job as helping to guide I.B.M.'s ''billions upon billions of dollars'' of investment in next-generation ''intelligent infrastructure'' for the Internet -- when vast numbers of devices, including cellular phones and Palm-like hand-held computers, would be connected to the Internet</p>
        <p>''Today's networked world is primitive compared to what it's going to look like in three to five years,'' he said.</p>
