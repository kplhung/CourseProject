        <p>TRAUBE-Mildred. Died on July 21, 2000 at age 90 at her home in NYC. Wife of the late Shepard Traube. Mother of Victoria Traube and Elizabeth Traube. Contributions may be made to the SSDC Foundation for the Mildred and Shepard Traube Fellowship, 1501 Broadway, NY, NY 10036. Services Wednesday, July 26, 4 PM, at ''The Riverside,'' 76 Street and Amsterdam Avenue.</p>
        <p>TRAUBE-Mildred. Everyone at the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization mourns the passing of Mildred Traube. Those of us who got to know Mildred will miss her straightforward opinions and clear-eyed wisdom, the result of a long and extraordinary life. Her daughter Vicky is one of our stalwart cohorts and we will be ever grateful to Mildred and Shepard for having brought Vicky into the world-and for having taken her to so much theater that she is practically a walking encyclopedia. Our condolences to Vicky and to Betsy.</p>
