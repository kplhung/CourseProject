        <p>Correction of July 13 Making Books column and July 14 Business Day article about $7.1 million book advance reportedly being paid to John F Welch Jr, chairman of General Electric Company</p>
      </abstract>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Making Books column on July 13 and an article in Business Day on July 14 about the $7.1 million book advance reportedly being paid to John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of the General Electric Company, referred to the precedents incompletely. (Similar references appeared in an Op-Ed page column on July 16, in the Media Talk column of Business Day on July 17 and in an editorial on July 20.) While the advance is apparently a single-book record for North American nonfiction rights, higher amounts have been paid for worldwide English rights. Pope John Paul II reportedly received an $8.5 million advance in 1994 for his book about Roman Catholicism in the modern era. The sale of Mr. Welch's worldwide English rights is expected to add millions to his North American advance.</p>
