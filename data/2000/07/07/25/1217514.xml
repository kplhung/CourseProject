        <p>You know this movie is in trouble when you find yourself rooting for the killer cockroaches. The humans in this insufficient melodrama warrant neither sympathy nor interest.</p>
        <p>''They Nest,'' which USA is allowing to escape tonight, does have the germ of an idea and a few scenes of squirm-inducing tension that may remind you of those dependable 1950's horror cheapos. But just because someone can remember a few scraps of an old formula, that doesn't make him a chemical engineer. Or a successful storyteller.</p>

        <p>You know this movie is in trouble when you find yourself rooting for the killer cockroaches. The humans in this insufficient melodrama warrant neither sympathy nor interest.</p>
        <p>''They Nest,'' which USA is allowing to escape tonight, does have the germ of an idea and a few scenes of squirm-inducing tension that may remind you of those dependable 1950's horror cheapos. But just because someone can remember a few scraps of an old formula, that doesn't make him a chemical engineer. Or a successful storyteller.</p>
        <p>The movie begins on a dark and stormy night out on the Atlantic, where a poor seaman is thrown overboard by his shipmates. It then moves to a Boston hospital, where Ben Cahill (Thomas Calabro), a surgeon who has some ill-defined competency issues, is dispatched on a forced leave. Ben retreats to the creepy house he recently bought on a creepy island in Maine.</p>
        <p>He probably should have made other travel plans. See, the body of that unfortunate sailor has washed up on that very same island, containing a colony of hardy African bugs. Where they nest is in the guts of people, who then vomit larvae and die. This is graphically depicted, over and over.</p>
        <p>Ben, who is rather smug for a surgeon with ill-defined competency issues, gets off on the wrong foot with several of the islanders, especially Jack Wald (John Savage). He's the drunken dolt who operates the island's electrical system and harbors a gnawing grudge against Ben because that creepy house was his family homestead before the bank foreclosed and sold it. There are lots of other dolts on the island and a few O.K. people, principally the levelheaded Sheriff Hobbs (Dean Stockwell) and the pretty, witty storekeeper, Nell (Kristen Dalton). These two actors deserve better vehicles. But then, so do the roaches.</p>
        <p>The bugs start multiplying like there's no tomorrow, turning unfortunate island dwellers into roach motels. Jack is one of the first victims. But when Ben hits Jack's body on the road on another dark and stormy night, some locals don't believe that Jack was already dead.</p>
        <p>You can gauge the level of the film's wit from what the sheriff tells Ben: ''The good news is you weren't drinkin'. The bad news is the entire town thinks you killed Jack on purpose. Either way, you're in a heap o' trouble, son.'' By the time everybody becomes aware of the bugs' appetite, the island is in an Everest o' trouble. The film hurtles quickly to a conclusion that makes even less sense than the beginning. Ellory Elkayem directed from a script by John Clafin and Daniel Zelman.</p>
        <p>If you are, unaccountably, still watching when this film does end, tip your hat to the screensful of special-effects people (and one insect wrangler). They, at least, seem to have met their challenge.</p>
        <p>THEY NEST</p>
