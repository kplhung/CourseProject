        <p>Saying that the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee appeared to be dragging his feet, Democrats urged him today to take action on his own proposal to establish prescription drug benefits under Medicare.</p>
        <p>In a letter to the chairman, Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, Democrats on the committee prodded him to convene the panel ''as early as possible, perhaps before the August recess,'' to vote on legislation adding drug benefits to Medicare.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth unveiled his proposal on July 10. Democrats said they liked many of its features, including benefits that would be uniform throughout the country, fully integrated into the Medicare program and administered by the government, not by private insurers.</p>
        <p>Republican senators, including Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant majority leader, gave Mr. Roth's proposal a cool reception, saying they feared that the costs could explode after a few years.</p>
        <p>Senator Roth is in a tight race for re-election against Gov. Thomas R. Carper, a Democrat.</p>
        <p>Democrats said Mr. Roth had reaped favorable publicity with his proposal two weeks ago. But now, they said, they see no evidence that he will try to push it through the Senate or even his own committee.</p>
        <p>''Senator Roth is starting to retreat or perhaps even run away from his commitment'' to move the legislation through the Finance Committee this month, said a Senate Democrat who had earlier praised Mr. Roth's effort.</p>
        <p>Ginny Flynn, a spokeswoman for Mr. Roth, said the senator was revising his proposal and would describe the changes on Thursday at a meeting of the committee behind closed doors. But, Ms. Flynn said, the committee will not formally take up the legislation or vote on it before the recess, which begins at the end of this week.</p>
        <p>Public opinion polls show that drug prices and the need for prescription drug coverage are major concerns of many voters.</p>
        <p>James M. Jordan, political director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which coordinates efforts to elect Democrats to the Senate, said Mr. Roth's proposal was ''a cynical political move'' that had little chance of success in the Senate, which Republicans control.  ''Mr. Roth's bill has never had any chance of real progress in the Senate,'' Mr. Jordan said, ''and he's done little if anything to ensure progress for the legislation.''</p>
        <p>But several Democrats on the Finance Committee commended Mr. Roth's effort, which would provide $40 billion over five years for drug benefits. The Democrats said more money was both needed and available, now that the Congressional Budget Office had increased its estimate of federal budget surpluses over the next decade.</p>
        <p>Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, said: ''Senator Roth deserved the kind of commendation he received for his original proposal. It took considerable political courage for him to break from the mantra that this had to be done through private health insurance.''</p>
        <p>A bill passed last month by the House would give subsidies to insurance companies to entice them into providing drug benefits to people on Medicare -- an approach opposed by President Clinton and by most Democrats in Congress, who say it is unlikely to work.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Roth's proposal, beneficiaries could stay in the original Medicare program or enroll in a high-option plan, which would provide drug benefits but would also charge more for services like home health care and skilled nursing care.</p>
