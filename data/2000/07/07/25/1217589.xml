        <p>NEW YORKERS have been organizing against a new store, which is not in itself an unusual social activity. Protesting new stores is the local equivalent of a barn-raising. But this crusade offered a rare glimpse into the native psyche.</p>
        <p>The new store, a CVS pharmacy planned for Broadway and 102nd Street, has none of the usual attributes that inspire protests. It would not be be a megastore that might look out of place or attract mobs. It would be the same size as the supermarket it replaces, attracting the same local customers, even selling some of the same products.</p>
        <p>It would be much like the other chain drugstores already on Broadway. And that is the problem, at least according to the 300 people who gathered in a basement on West 100th Street last week. Although they didn't resent CVS any more than the others, they considered it one drugstore too many. They preferred a supermarket, and collected more than $800 to organize a boycott.</p>
        <p>They might be right about the surfeit of drugstores, but why spend money and time on a political battle? If there aren't enough customers, CVS or one of its competitors will go out of business, opening up space for a grocery store or anything else.</p>
        <p>Why bother boycotting a store you're convinced is doomed? The answer could help us get to the roots of our retail phobia, but it probably won't be pretty. Some possible diagnoses:</p>
        <p>Too much free time. The protesters at last week's meeting spoke in horror of the extra two blocks they now had to walk to another supermarket, but it was hard to believe the extra two minutes (four minutes for the round trip) could make that much difference to them. These were the same people spending two hours at a meeting so they could sign up to do picket duty for an hour every week.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers like to think of themselves as impossibly harried, but they actually have more spare time than suburbanites. Free from having to take care of houses and lawns, often without children, they can concentrate on larger social questions. At Wednesday's meeting, they and the politicians present were already citing the need for a new law to prevent catastrophes like new drugstores.</p>
        <p>Alas, they didn't get into specifics. A new local Pharmacy-Free Zoning District? A Drugstore Control Board to determine the proper citywide drugstore-to-supermarket ratio? Working out the details will take time, but the people at the meeting seemed to have an ample supply.</p>
        <p>Closet conservatism. The CVS drugstore may be provoking the same irrational fear that greeted book superstores here: an innate aversion to anything new. If you doubt this trait, try a thought experiment. Suppose Barnes &amp; Noble suddenly closed its stores and left New Yorkers to the mercy of small shops with limited selection, no discounts, shorter hours and no amenities like easy chairs and coffee bars.</p>
        <p>JOURNALISTS would promptly report on bereft bibliophiles unable to afford new books or find them anywhere late at night. Nostalgists would recall lazy afternoons in the good old superstore and recall love affairs that began in the self-help section. Everyone would denounce corporate greed for destroying a New York institution.</p>
        <p>Extortion. Shaking down merchants is traditional among some New York politicians and activists who demand contributions to ''the community.'' Some politicians at Wednesday's meeting might have had money on their minds; say, a future campaign contribution from a drugstore chain anxious to avoid unpleasant legislation. But most of the protesters seemed less motivated by money than by . . .</p>
        <p>Power. John Davenport, a leader of the boycott, denounced the ''boardroom Napoleons'' at CVS for warring on ''the neighborhood,'' which he defined as ''ordinary hard-working men and women whose lives have been adversely affected by these corporate power plays.''</p>
        <p>But these alleged Napoleons did not have the power to force anyone to shop anywhere. They had to await the decision of  ''the neighborhood,'' if by neighborhood you mean the tens of thousands of people who walk along Broadway. Every day they would vote by spending money in whatever store appealed to them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davenport and his fellow protesters, though, had no patience for such a tedious democratic process. They already knew the outcome. Maybe in their hearts they really believed that 300 people with two hours to spend at an antidrugstore meeting constituted a representative sample of ''the neighborhood.'' Or maybe they were the ones with the secret little Napoleon complex.</p>
