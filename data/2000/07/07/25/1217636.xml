        <p>Amid the overheated words and overheated hamstrings at the Olympic track and field trials, Marion Jones showed cool restraint in the way she spoke and the way she ran. She did not blow up on the track or at any of her competitors. Instead, she assuredly dominated the sprints, won the long jump and emerged clearer than ever as the focus of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Not since Carl Lewis in 1984 had any American won three events at the Olympic trials. Because Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene both cramped in the 200-meter final, eliminating themselves from Olympic eligibility in the event, Jones became the only American who will try to win multiple gold medals in individual events in Sydney. Regina Jacobs won the women's 1,500 and 5,000 at the trials, but said she intended to run only the metric mile.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad it's all over,'' Jones said Sunday after winning the women's 200 in 21.94 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year and an indication that she is in form to try to become the first female track and field athlete to win five golds in one Olympics. ''Now I can go home and relax.'' In addition to the 100, 200 and the long jump, Jones will run on two relay teams.</p>
        <p>There are still some things to learn, and the trials provided valuable experience. Jones admitted to putting so much emotion into the 200 semifinals -- when her main competitor, the world champion Inger Miller, was in an adjacent lane -- that by the final, she felt drained. ''I feel pooped,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She asked Johnson why the sprinters were being forced to run the semis and the final in less than two hours, and he replied: ''Get used to it. That's how it will be in Sydney.''</p>
        <p>Smartly, she stayed off her feet between rounds and drank fluids to keep her legs from seizing up.</p>
        <p>''This was really difficult,'' Jones said. ''I've always said it's not going to be easy in Sydney. I'd be the first to tell you it's going to be quite difficult. But the fact that I can come here and get through all three of these is motivating for me.''</p>
        <p>Unlike Johnson and Greene, she refused to be drawn into any verbal jousting with her opponents. She said nothing more controversial than that her husband, the world champion shot-putter C. J. Hunter, always says that he will take out the garbage but inevitably leaves it to her.</p>
        <p>''You never hear me say a bad word about anybody,'' Jones said after the 200 preliminaries. ''What I want to do is run fast. I'm tired of all this talking. If you're going to talk, put up. Come to the track and be ready to run. That's all I ask.''</p>
        <p>As it turned out, neither Johnson nor Greene was ready to run. Their cramping episodes pointed out the peculiar state of track and field in which many of the top stars seldom compete against each other. Instead of building rivalries, they seem to avoid them. Johnson and Greene had raced only twice previously. When a matchup does occur, the event becomes magnified so greatly that the result is often one of disappointment or unfulfillment.</p>
        <p>Also, the cramping raises the question of whether the use of nutritional supplements like creatine, which is perfectly legal but which can cause dehydration, helped cause the stunning, grimacing withdrawals.</p>
        <p>''I don't have a list of what supplements he has been taking,'' said Greene's agent, Emanuel Hudson. Brad Hunt, Johnson's agent, could not be reached for comment. Greene is expected to see a doctor on Tuesday, Hudson said, adding that Greene feels he can return to competition in two to three weeks. But Greene's coach, John Smith, feels he may be sidelined until a meet in Berlin on Sept 1.</p>
        <p>Johnson has now pulled up lame in two visible races -- the 200 at the Olympic trials and a 1997 match race against Donovan Bailey of Canada, the reigning Olympic champion at 100 meters. Curiously, both times Johnson seemed to grow distracted by the trash-talking beforehand and injured himself, as if pressing with his legs to validate what he had promised with his words. He is normally taciturn, assured without being boastful or critical, and both times he has drifted out of character he has met painful frustration.</p>
        <p>Johnson seemed certain that his injury was nothing more than a cramp and that he would begin running again soon. He will not be able to repeat as Olympic champion at 200 meters, but he will defend his title at 400 meters, where he is so dominant that he has lost only three times in his last 78 races.</p>
        <p>Perhaps only Tommie Smith has ever possessed the kind of speed and endurance in the long sprints that Johnson does, and no one but Johnson has won the 200 and 400 at the same Olympics. While some will question his brittleness in important races, he does hold world records in the 200 (19.32 seconds) and the 400 (43.18 seconds); his place in sprinting history is assured. The world record in the 200 may be the greatest achievement in track and field besides the startling long jump of 29 feet 2 1/2 inches by Bob Beamon at the 1968 Games in Mexico City.</p>
        <p>''Carl Lewis, having nine gold medals, is someone to be respected above all,'' said Ato Boldon of Trinidad, who won bronze medals at 100 and 200 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and who has frequently raced against Johnson. ''But I know enough about what Michael has done and what he has overcome in his career. He's taken on all comers and done very well. I place him a very close second behind Carl.''</p>
        <p>Jones, too, will be compared with Lewis, who won four gold medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The difference is that Lewis was an assured long jumper. He won four gold medals in the event, and while Jones finally breached 23 feet this season at the trials, her form is awkward and her jumping is erratic. She nearly failed to qualify for the last three jumps in the final. Mike Powell, who finally broke Beamon's record in 1991, said he had again offered to help Jones refine her technique before Sydney.</p>
        <p>''Right now it's a crapshoot with Marion,'' said Powell, who has watched her jump since high school. ''Carl did not have to worry about the long jump. With Marion, it's, 'Am I going to qualify for the final or win the gold medal?' ''</p>
