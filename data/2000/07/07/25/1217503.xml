        <p>Urging older people to have stress tests before they begin exercise programs, a common medical practice, is not only unfounded but may even discourage people from getting the physical activity they need, a new study reports.</p>
        <p>The vast majority of older people do not need the test, in which heart function is measured as a patient uses a treadmill, the researchers wrote in a recent issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association. Instead, they said, the patients should simply have complete physical examinations.</p>
        <p>The lead author of the study, Dr. Thomas M. Gill, a professor of internal medicine and geriatrics at Yale, noted that only about a third of elderly people are considered physically active.</p>
        <p>''That's discouraging to us,'' he said, ''because in the past, there has been a wealth of new evidence demonstrating the benefits of physical activity and exercise.''</p>
        <p>The study said a review of the evidence suggested that the risk of heart attack related to exercise might be overstated, and the researchers suggested that the overall benefits of exercise outweighed any risk.</p>
        <p>In a 79-year-old woman, vigorous exercise like slow jogging, speed-walking or tennis appeared to raise the annual risk of a heart attack to 1.6 percent from 1.3 percent. In a 90-year-old man, the risk rose to 4.8 percent, from 3.9 percent. Less stressful forms of exercise carry even less risk, the study said.</p>
        <p>Under the guidelines of the American Heart Association and the American College of Sports Medicine, doctors are advised to conduct stress tests routinely among older people who want to start exercising. The goal is to detect asymptomatic heart blockages. But often, Dr. Gill said, older people cannot complete the treadmill test satisfactorily, and so require more elaborate tests to determine if there is a blockage.</p>
        <p>Still, he said, older people who have not been active should begin slowly, with activities like walking and balance exercises.</p>
