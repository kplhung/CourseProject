        <p>I witnessed a wild debate in Jordan the other day.</p>
        <p>It went like this: A Syrian recently tried to hijack a Jordanian jetliner flying to Damascus. A security guard shot the hijacker, who almost set off a grenade. The public was outraged at the security lapse, and none other than Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein, the brother and security chief of King Abdullah, was called on the carpet by Jordanians who wanted to know how this lapse could have happened, with some even calling the king's brother by his first name, Ali.</p>

        <p>I witnessed a wild debate in Jordan the other day.</p>
        <p>It went like this: A Syrian recently tried to hijack a Jordanian jetliner flying to Damascus. A security guard shot the hijacker, who almost set off a grenade. The public was outraged at the security lapse, and none other than Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein, the brother and security chief of King Abdullah, was called on the carpet by Jordanians who wanted to know how this lapse could have happened, with some even calling the king's brother by his first name, Ali.</p>
        <p>Where was this debate? It wasn't in the Jordanian Parliament or media. It all happened online on Jordan's biggest Internet portal, Nets.com.jo, where Jordanians, using their real names, raked Prince Ali over the coals over the Web, and Ali came online to personally defend ''against all those who trash our Armed Forces and Security Services.''</p>
        <p>Message: While all eyes are on the Arab-Israeli peace process, there is a whole other process -- democratization -- percolating in the Arab world, in which the Internet and globalization are acting like nutcrackers to open societies and empower Arab democrats with new tools. But don't kid yourself, anti-democratic countertrends are also flourishing, and there's no telling who will prevail.</p>
        <p>But at least now there's a lively battle. Check out the Web site of The Cairo Times, a feisty new English-language Egyptian paper published out of Cyprus. The Egyptian government censors The Cairo Times when it comes into Egypt. And what do the editors of The Cairo Times do? They now print in bright red letters on their Web site (cairotimes.com) everything the government takes out, in a section entitled: ''The Forbidden File -- See what the censor has cut from our print edition. . . . These articles were chopped apart. . . .'' You can then call up the original of, say, ''A Sweetheart Economy? Just How Bad Is Corruption in Egypt?'' and see just what the censor didn't like.</p>
        <p>Jordan's new young King Abdullah, who understands globalization better than any Arab leader today, recently decided to privatize the Jordanian press because he felt his kingdom could never modernize without newspapers with real news. While Arab Internet sites are still confined to the elites, in most Arab countries today 70 percent of the populations are under age 30, and they are getting wired remarkably fast.</p>
        <p>But Arab democrats have their work cut out for them. In a shameful move three weeks ago, Egypt arrested an American University of Cairo democratization specialist, Saad Eddin Ibrahim, on some nonsensical charges. Even worse, several Jordanian commentators wrote editorials supporting Mr. Ibrahim's arrest -- because he was funded by the European Union in his election monitoring and because he had supported normalization with Israel. Some Arab pundits still hate Israel and the West more than they love democracy.</p>
        <p>But the good news was that Rami Khouri, a courageous Jordanian columnist and democrat, wrote that for Egypt's regime -- which lives off U.S. aid -- to be arresting an Egyptian intellectual for receiving foreign funding for election monitoring was the height of hypocrisy. Mr. Khouri denounced the ''Arab states' moral drift, self-serving judicial thuggery and political heavy-handedness'' and denounced his colleagues who supported the Ibrahim arrest as ''confused and insecure.''</p>
        <p>In the West Bank, Palestinian democrats are now resisting Yasir Arafat. Palestinian journalists have started a Web site, Amin.org, to publish all the articles censored by local editors or Arafat goons. As the Palestinian intellectual Khalil Shikaki put it: With Yasir Arafat ''we have a one-man ruler, who won't share power or recognize civil society. [His attitude is] 'I will give you a state and you run it as you like. When I die, take my thumb and sign whatever you want, but until then let me get a state.' So we need a state to end the legacy of the P.L.O. -- its legacy is authoritarianism, secrecy, security courts and lack of accountability.''</p>
        <p>In the 20th century, the Arab states thrived by developing oil. In the 21st century they will thrive only if they develop their people, and the only way to do that is by democratizing. The battle is on, and thanks to the Internet and globalization the Arab democrats finally have some artillery.</p>
