        <p>A Superior Court judge here agreed to a request today from three former Trumbull High School wrestlers to avoid a trial on charges arising out of a violent hazing incident on Feb. 1.</p>
        <p>After granting the application for accelerated rehabilitation, Judge Gerard Esposito told the three, Daniel Scinto and Jeremy Dommu, both 18, and Christopher Ricci, 16, ''I don't know what was going through your heads, but you have two years to earn yourselves dismissal.''</p>
        <p>The three were all wrestling team members at the high school in Trumbull, a suburb north of Bridgeport. They were among those accused of hogtieing a 15-year-old sophomore, hurling him against a wall and holding him down while teammates forced a plastic knife into his rectum.</p>
        <p>Eight of the team's 15 members were charged in the attacks, but Mr. Scinto, Mr. Dommu and Mr. Ricci were the only ones charged as adults. Seven of the eight were expelled from the school earlier this year.</p>
        <p>While insisting that the attacks went well beyond what he would term ''hazing,'' Ralph Iassogna, the Trumbull schools superintendent, said today that the school had instituted assembly and training programs for coaches and students.</p>
        <p>The judge said the victim's decision not to oppose the application for leniency helped him in coming to a decision. The victim's lawyer, Howard Klebanoff, said after the hearing: ''The family feels they'd rather seek redress in the civil courts. They are not seeking vengeance.''</p>
        <p>The defendants' lawyers sought to impress the court that the incident was an aberration in lives otherwise filled with academic and athletic promise and volunteer activities.</p>
        <p>Margaret Kelly, an assistant state's attorney, asked the judge to deny accelerated rehabilitation, saying, ''The offense is just too serious.''</p>
        <p>Judge Esposito imposed the maximum term of probation -- two years -- and ordered psychological evaluation and treatment if indicated. He also ordered them to reimburse the victim's family for $7,000 in medical expenses within six months.</p>
