        <p>When Dhani Jones, the Giants' sixth-round draft pick, agreed to a contract two weeks ago, Giants executives were stunned when Jones refused to sign the deal in the team's offices.</p>
        <p>Jones, a linebacker from the University of Michigan, said he had no problem with the terms of the pact.</p>
        <p>''He just said he wasn't signing it,'' Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi said later, describing the scene. ''I said, 'Why won't you sign it?' He was very polite but he said it again -- that he didn't want to.''</p>
        <p>And then Jones, who had gone to Giants Stadium to work out anyway, went downstairs to the team's exercise room and began a session on the treadmill.</p>
        <p>The next morning, Accorsi looked up from his desk and saw Jones in a finely tailored blue suit with a red silk tie and a camera in his hands. Now, Jones informed Accorsi, he was ready to sign his contract. And he wanted help taking the pictures he planned to send home to his parents in Maryland.</p>
        <p>''I had been in jeans and a T-shirt -- leisure wear -- the day before and that didn't seem right,'' Jones said today at Giants training camp, recounting the scene. ''Signing a contract like that is an important first step. You wear a uniform for a football game, and there's a uniform for conducting business. I really believe in that.</p>
        <p>''My parents taught me well, and I wanted to send them those pictures to show I had listened to some of what they said.''</p>
        <p>Accorsi said: ''In my 30 years of doing this, it's one of the most classy things I've ever seen.''</p>
        <p>Jones is a rookie who will most likely make this year's team as a special-teams player and occasional substitute as a nickel linebacker, a valuable role once filled by Scott Galyon, who left the Giants to sign as a free agent in Miami. Along the way, Giants fans will most likely get to know Jones for things beyond football.</p>
        <p>He would probably like that.</p>
        <p>Jones, for example, is an artist who created his own major at Michigan, which he called self-representation. His artwork, often multilayered, is a byproduct of mixed media -- photography, painting, poetry -- and any number of other tools and techniques he adapts to a project.</p>
        <p>Jones, who earned a fine arts degree, takes his work, which is football, and his art, seriously. After being drafted by the Giants in April -- and long before he had drawn any salary from the team -- he moved to New Jersey, the first of the rookies to begin working out regularly at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>But when Jones looked for a nearby apartment, he chose one with an old garage, which he quickly converted to a studio.</p>
        <p>Jones's father is a retired Navy commander, and his mother is an anesthesiologist. Jones, who said his first name means ''thinking man'' in Hawaiian, said his family was encouraged to engage in philosophical debates.</p>
        <p>''We'd be up at 2 or 3 in the morning and just want to get in an argument,'' Jones said, smiling. ''They always wanted me to use my mind. I was told that if you're smarter, that's always a good thing.''</p>
        <p>Jones traveled as his father's job changed, living in Japan and the Philippines. Back in Maryland as a teenager, he excelled at football, wrestling and track, then went on to play four years at Michigan. He was moved around to various linebacker spots, which probably hurt him when he was being evaluated by National Football League scouts. It is called being lost in the shuffle, even if you make eight solo tackles in your final college game at the Orange Bowl, with two of those tackles being behind-the-line stops of the all-American running back Shaun Alexander.</p>
        <p>At 6 feet 1 inch and 240 pounds, with 4.6-second speed in the 40-yard dash and quick reflexes, Jones has the physical talent to fill several roles for the Giants, who could use the defensive help. What Jones, 22, needs is the experience and time to learn the nuances of his position.</p>
        <p>''I'm studying as hard as I can, trying to listen to everything the veterans say,'' Jones said. ''I still get mad at myself when I don't do things the right way, though. I say to myself: 'It's the only thing you do, for something like five hours a day for five months. Why can't you do it the best?' ''</p>
        <p>The Giants coaching staff likes what it has seen in Jones so far.</p>
        <p>''Dhani has a great motor,'' said the defensive coordinator John Fox, using the established football term for a player with an unbridled passion for the game. ''And there's an athleticism there that you can't coach.''</p>
        <p>There is also a respect for the chance he has been given.</p>
        <p>''Before I came to the Giants, my father asked me if I really wanted to play football,'' Jones said, ''because I had succeeded in the classroom and I could have done other things. And I explained that I wanted to maximize an athletic potential and I wanted to reach people around me to understand how blessed we all are to be around the sport.</p>
        <p>''It might be my duty to challenge the stereotype that football players aren't thinkers or aren't cultured. And to bring others along to challenge it, too. As a pro football player, they give you the opportunity. Only you, the player, can take it away.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Running back SEAN BENNETT will sit out practice for the rest of this week and miss Saturday's intrasquad scrimmage because of a disk problem in his back. Coach JIM FASSEL said Bennett's injury was not serious. Bennett said he injured his back last week. . . . Tackle LOMAS BROWN left practice Monday afternoon because he was dehydrated. . . . Center DUSTY ZEIGLER, who was poked in the eye Saturday, has not returned to practice. . . . The Giants had their first camp scuffle, with MICHAEL STRAHAN ripping the helmet off the rookie tackle CHRIS ZIEMANN. . . . The New England Patriots, citing a spate of injuries, canceled Thursday's scheduled joint practice with the Giants.</p>
