        <p>The Mystics said they had nothing to prove tonight. They had beaten the Liberty in their two previous meetings this season, which, their All-Star guard Nikki McCray said, meant ''we already have the tie breaker against New York.''</p>
        <p>But this is a new-look Liberty team, and it has been proving a lot for weeks. It arrived at the MCI Center in the thick of the Eastern Conference race, having won seven of its last eight games, a team on an emotional high after defeating the Houston Comets, the Women's National Basketball Association's three-time defending champions.</p>

        <p>The Mystics said they had nothing to prove tonight. They had beaten the Liberty in their two previous meetings this season, which, their All-Star guard Nikki McCray said, meant ''we already have the tie breaker against New York.''</p>
        <p>But this is a new-look Liberty team, and it has been proving a lot for weeks. It arrived at the MCI Center in the thick of the Eastern Conference race, having won seven of its last eight games, a team on an emotional high after defeating the Houston Comets, the Women's National Basketball Association's three-time defending champions.</p>
        <p>The momentum continued tonight as the Liberty outplayed and outlasted the Mystics, winning by 78-64 to raise its season record to 15-10.</p>
        <p>Vickie Johnson led the Liberty with 22 points and kept Chamique Holdsclaw of the Mystics (15 points) in check. Murriel Page paced the Mystics with 18 points and a game-high 11 rebounds.</p>
        <p>The Mystics (11-13), struggling to keep their hold on the fourth playoff spot with eight games remaining, had reason to feel pretty good about themselves, too, going into the game. They earned a nail-biting victory Saturday over the Orlando Miracle, another of the top teams in the East.</p>
        <p>''We've proven that we can beat New York, when we played them here and then beat them in the Garden,'' McCray said before tonight's game. ''But New York is playing well, probably as good as they've played all year long, and that's a challenge for us.</p>
        <p>''For us to beat the best team so far in the East, Orlando, was a confidence builder for us, and for New York to beat Houston, they're feeling pretty good and we're feeling pretty good. So right now it's a battle of the feeling-pretty-goods.''</p>
        <p>Both teams looked good from the start.</p>
        <p>The Liberty won the tip-off and scored on an easy layup by Tamika Whitmore 40 seconds into the game. The Mystics responded with a four-foot running jump shot by McCray. For much of the half, both teams played virtually textbook basketball. The Liberty shot 57.1 percent from the field, the Mystics 55.6 percent.</p>
        <p>The Liberty held a 40-37 halftime lead behind 12 points from Whitmore and two 3-pointers by Becky Hammon. McCray led the Mystics with 12 points; she finished with 17.</p>
        <p>In the second half, every time the Liberty appeared ready to distance itself from the Mystics, Washington nipped at its heels. A 47-47 tie was broken when McCray scored on baseline drive to the basket.</p>
        <p>The Liberty scrambled back on a quick layup by Tari Phillips with 12 minutes 10 seconds to go.</p>
        <p>Then Johnson took a pass from Teresa Weatherspoon and sprinted downcourt for what appeared to be an easy layup, only to be caught from behind by McCray, who swatted the ball out of bounds. Johnson complained. So did her teammate Sue Wicks, who received a technical foul. The 17,988 fans roared their approval, and the Mystics seized the moment to build a 54-51 lead.</p>
        <p>And still the Liberty wouldn't go away. This wasn't the same team that suffered a humiliating defeat by Washington a month ago on a desperation shot by Holdsclaw, or the team that on its first visit here appeared dazed and confused by its own unfamiliar faces.</p>
        <p>Tonight, the Liberty players executed when they had to. With three minutes to play, they built 64-59 lead on a three-foot jumper by Phillips. She fouled out with 2:28 to play, with 14 points and 9 rebounds, but by then the Liberty held a 66-59 advantage.</p>
        <p>''Our defense was very very good,'' Coach Richie Adubato said. ''I only played seven players because we had to stay big, and I was worried they would run out of gas. But we didn't wear down. We kept pressing. We had to reach back and did. They played with tremendous spirit and enthusiasm.''</p>
