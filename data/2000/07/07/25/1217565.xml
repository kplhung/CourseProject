      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on rumored selection of Richard B Cheney as Gov George W Bush's Vice Presidential running mate holds Cheney would bring foreign policy and national security experience to Republican Presidential ticket but would allow Democrats to argue that selection proves that Bush is inexperienced in key areas and is still dependent on former President George Bush's name and advisers</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Fate and the Bush family -- or maybe it is fate in the form of the Bush family -- seem to have a way of intervening in the life of Richard B. Cheney. In 1989 he was serving as minority whip in the House of Representatives when President George Bush made him secretary of defense after the Senate rejected the nomination of Senator John Tower of Texas. This year Mr. Cheney was out of government and five years into a career as a Texas oil executive when Gov. George W. Bush of Texas made him director of his vice-presidential search committee. It now appears that Mr. Cheney has found himself. Therein hangs a splendid opportunity for political divination.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's most obvious asset as a running mate is that he could provide an instant gravitas injection for a ticket headed by Governor Bush. Given Mr. Cheney's role in running the gulf war, his presence would shore up Mr. Bush in his weakest areas, foreign policy and national security. The downside is that a Cheney selection would allow Democrats to argue that the lightly experienced Mr. Bush is still dependent on both his father's name and his key advisers. The counterspin from the Bush campaign would be that the candidate is secure enough to surround himself with weighty figures.</p>

        <p>Fate and the Bush family -- or maybe it is fate in the form of the Bush family -- seem to have a way of intervening in the life of Richard B. Cheney. In 1989 he was serving as minority whip in the House of Representatives when President George Bush made him secretary of defense after the Senate rejected the nomination of Senator John Tower of Texas. This year Mr. Cheney was out of government and five years into a career as a Texas oil executive when Gov. George W. Bush of Texas made him director of his vice-presidential search committee. It now appears that Mr. Cheney has found himself. Therein hangs a splendid opportunity for political divination.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's most obvious asset as a running mate is that he could provide an instant gravitas injection for a ticket headed by Governor Bush. Given Mr. Cheney's role in running the gulf war, his presence would shore up Mr. Bush in his weakest areas, foreign policy and national security. The downside is that a Cheney selection would allow Democrats to argue that the lightly experienced Mr. Bush is still dependent on both his father's name and his key advisers. The counterspin from the Bush campaign would be that the candidate is secure enough to surround himself with weighty figures.</p>
        <p>But whatever they say about Mr. Cheney, the Democrats would be relieved to see his name on the ticket rather than that of Gen. Colin Powell. For months, supporters of Vice President Al Gore have spoken of Bush-Powell as a nightmare ticket that would put the election out of reach before it begins. Campaigns, of course, rarely play out in predictable ways, but there is no doubt that Mr. Powell could change the dynamic in a way that no one else could.</p>
        <p>Instead of excitement, Mr. Cheney offers solidity, unity and, based on his record at defense, toughness. His House record is conservative enough for the Republican right. At 59, he does not represent as big a threat to younger Republicans looking to run for president in four or eight years. Then there is the loyalty issue. Mr. Bush would never have to worry about Dick Cheney's next quote, not the case if he picked a prickly free spirit like Senator John McCain.</p>
        <p>This record would provide plenty of targets for Mr. Gore, who might also be relieved that Mr. Cheney, a Wyoming native, would not have an obvious impact on the electoral vote.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush does select Mr. Cheney, though, that choice might in some way be connected to Mr. Gore's own service as vice president. President Clinton and Mr. Gore got the public fully accustomed to seeing the vice president cast and marketed as a senior adviser rather than a space holder. If he chooses Mr. Cheney, Mr. Bush will be giving that model a place of even greater prominence.</p>
