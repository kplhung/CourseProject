        <p>More than 900,000 elderly and disabled people will soon be dropped by health maintenance organizations pulling out of the Medicare program, the Clinton administration said today.</p>
        <p>The number, which is substantially greater than estimates last month by the H.M.O. industry, underlines the turbulence and instability of the market in which Medicare beneficiaries seek private health insurance.</p>
        <p>After a preliminary survey last month, the American Association of Health Plans, the chief lobby for the industry, predicted that health plans would cancel insurance coverage for 711,000 Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>The administration's count, 933,687, is almost a third greater; it represents nearly one-sixth of the 6.2 million Medicare recipients in H.M.O.'s. Altogether, 39 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare.</p>
        <p>Medicare beneficiaries dropped by H.M.O.'s have until Jan. 1 to make new arrangements for their health insurance. They can enroll in other managed care plans, if any are available in their area, or return to Medicare's original fee-for-service program.</p>
        <p>Most H.M.O.'s offer prescription drug benefits and other services not provided in the fee-for-service program.</p>
        <p>The number of people affected by the new withdrawals far exceeds the number in either of the last two years. In those years, H.M.O.'s pulled out of more than 400 counties in at least 33 states, directly affecting 734,000 Medicare beneficiaries -- 407,000 in 1999 and 327,000 this year. The turmoil has touched or will touch 27 percent of all beneficiaries enrolled in managed care.</p>
        <p>Reasons for the pullouts are a subject of heated debate. While the administration says current payment rates are adequate or more than adequate, it also says Congress needs to approve President Clinton's proposal to pay H.M.O.'s for providing prescription drug benefits. Under current law, health plans do not receive an explicit payment for drug benefits, though many offer such coverage, sometimes for an additional premium.</p>
        <p>In announcing the new figures, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said, ''The volatility of the Medicare managed care market underscores the need for Congress to enact the president's legislative proposal to modernize and strengthen Medicare.''</p>
        <p>But Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, said H.M.O.'s were pulling out of Medicare because they were ''overregulated and underpaid'' by the federal government.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ignagni said the administration had underestimated the problem for two years, but now ''shows a growing recognition of its urgency.'' She said Congress should increase direct payments to H.M.O.'s by $15 billion over the next five years, an increase of 5.5 percent. That sum does not include the billions of dollars that H.M.O.'s would receive for providing drug benefits under Mr. Clinton's plan and most Congressional proposals.</p>
        <p>The number of people being dropped by H.M.O.'s varies greatly by state because companies typically do business in some states but not others, and they may withdraw from selected counties or states. In Texas, for example, almost three times as many Medicare recipients will be dropped as in New York State.</p>
        <p>The government figures show that the withdrawals will, for example, affect 24,327 people in Arizona, 52,464 in California, 51,185 in Connecticut, 87,727 in Florida, 18,144 in Illinois, 53,038 in Maryland, 21,781 in Massachusetts, 12,411 in New Jersey, 64,329 in New York, 65,617 in Ohio, 89,641 in Pennsylvania, 32,177 in Washington  and 180,749 in Texas.</p>
        <p>The Health Care Financing Administration said that 65 H.M.O.'s chose not to renew their Medicare contracts next year, while 53 health plans decided to withdraw from selected counties.</p>
        <p>About 775,000 of the affected beneficiaries, or 83 percent, live in areas served by other H.M.O.'s and could enroll in them if those health plans are accepting more Medicare patients. About 159,000 beneficiaries, or 17 percent of those being dropped by managed care plans next year, will be left without any H.M.O. options.</p>
        <p>The government said it expected to pay H.M.O.'s an average of $573 a month, or $6,876 a year, for each Medicare beneficiary they serve next year. Payments are somewhat lower in counties from which H.M.O.'s are pulling out. In those counties, Medicare will pay an average of $541 a month, or $6,492 a year, 94 percent of the national average.</p>
        <p>Medicare payments to H.M.O.'s vary by county, reflecting differences in the cost of care provided by doctors and hospitals in the fee-for-service program. The administration said people in high-paid urban areas as well as low-paid rural areas would be affected by the H.M.O. withdrawals.</p>
