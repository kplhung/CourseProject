        <p>Pricing the Priceless</p>
        <p>Some things in life are priceless, as that ubiquitous television commercial for a credit card company says. Take rain forests, for example. Their environmental and ecological value to the world would seem to be beyond measure.</p>
        <p>But what about the value of the rain forests to the people who live in them? While some researchers have tried to estimate what the forest is worth, a study led by an anthropologist at Brandeis University has tried a more direct approach.</p>
        <p>The results, reported in Nature, indicate that the value to local people is low, helping to explain why they might chop the forests down to use the land for other things.</p>
        <p>In the study, the researchers visited two villages in eastern Honduras on 140 randomly chosen days in 1995 and 1996. They identified, weighed and put a value on all the forest goods entering households, including fish and game, wild plants and firewood. They also recorded any sales of goods within the village or to outsiders.</p>
        <p>The researchers arrived at a range in annual value of about $18 to $24 per hectare (a hectare is about 2 1/2 acres). This is lower than even the low end of previous estimates, which ranged from about $49 to $1,089.</p>
        <p>It is also far lower than the rain forest's global worth (which, while seemingly priceless, does have some estimates attached to it, in the range of $1,700 per hectare per year). ''Unless rural people are paid for the nonlocal values of rain forests,'' the researchers wrote, ''they may be easily persuaded to deforest.''</p>
        <p>E. Coli's Sickly Embrace</p>
        <p>Not all strains of E. coli bacteria cause sickness, but those that do can get a strong grip on a person, particularly the young and elderly, killing through dehydration or kidney failure. And it is literally a strong grip: the bacteria function by attaching themselves to cells on the intestinal walls.</p>
        <p>Now, using X-ray crystallography, researchers from the University of British Columbia have shown what happens at a molecular level when the bacteria bind to intestinal cells.</p>
        <p>E. coli's outer membrane contains a protein, called intimin, that serves as the glue. But first, the bacterium must insert a different protein, called a receptor, into the intestinal cell. The two proteins then bind.</p>
        <p>The protein-receptor complex was difficult to analyze whole, so the researchers broke it down into functional crystal fragments, which were then analyzed through crystallography (in which the pattern of X-ray diffraction through a crystal is analyzed to determine structure). Their work was reported in Nature.</p>
        <p>Knowing how two proteins bind in this way is a step toward designing a drug that will inhibit the binding.</p>
        <p>The researchers suggested that their work might eventually help in the development of a vaccine against E. coli infection.</p>
        <p>Boon for Astronomers</p>
        <p>Astronomers face constant battles against light and radio frequency pollution, so delegates to the World Radiocommunication Conference in Istanbul this spring provided some welcome news. The conference, which allocates parts of the radio spectrum for various uses, approved measures to protect a significant swath of high frequencies, above about 70 gigahertz, for astronomy.</p>
        <p>Radio astronomers are increasingly using this part of the radio spectrum, known as the millimeter wave region, to detect the spectral lines of molecules in space.</p>
        <p>But commercial satellite projects under development also plan to use frequencies in the same range. The new measures make sure that future satellite transmitters operating in the range stay away from those frequencies that are useful to astronomers. Without such protection, the faint signals from space would be easily overwhelmed.</p>
