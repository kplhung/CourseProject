        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''In Iran, More Women Leaving Nest for University'' (news article, July 22) exemplifies what is happening with remarkable speed all over the world. The extent of coeducation is, perhaps more than any other, a measure of the emergence of women with full rights.</p>
        <p>No other extension of women's rights establishes as clearly as does coeducation that women are fully the intellectual, social and economic equals of men. Coeducation implies acceptance of women at a level of equality very rarely achieved in history before our own time.</p>
        <p>It is useful to recall that it was only in 1833 that Oberlin College became the first fully coeducational institution of higher education in America, and that many leading American universities became coeducational only in the last 30 years.</p>
