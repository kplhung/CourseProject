        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: NEW LAWS AID MILOSEVIC  Yugoslavia's federal Parliament approved new election laws that provide President Slobodan Milosevic with the legal framework to stay in power. The laws define new election procedures under which a president is elected by a majority in a popular vote, regardless of turnout, in a country where the opposition may boycott the polls. They also allow the president a second four-year term. Mr. Milosevic, who was elected in 1997 after serving two terms as president of Serbia, is widely expected to run.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: REBEL ASSAULT  Chechen rebels mounted an unusual daytime attack, underlining their growing boldess by ambushing a Russian military convoy in the secessionist republic's capital, Grozny, killing 3 Russians and wounding 17, officials said. The rebels set off a mine under one of the trucks in a Russian convoy, then opened fire on the soldiers with automatic weapons and grenade launchers.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: IMMIGRANT DEATHS  The police discovered the bodies of a man and a woman in waters off Spain's southern Mediterranean coast and the victims were believed to have drowned in a new surge of clandestine immigration from North Africa. At least three dozen illegal aliens were picked up yesterday, the day after authorities apprehended 311 people, mostly Moroccans and sub-Saharan Africans, crossing the Strait of Gibraltar in a record one-day total.</p>

        <p>SWITZERLAND: RUSSIAN WINS DAMAGES  A Geneva court awarded a Russian businessman $530,000 in compensation for two years he spent in prison before being acquitted of money-laundering charges. Sergei Mikhailov, 41, had been accused by the Swiss court of being a top figure in a Russian criminal organization. But in 1998 he was released after 778 days in custody, when a Geneva correctional court dismissed the charges for lack of evidence.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>LEBANON: U.N. TROOPS TO DEPLOY  United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan told the Security Council that Israel has ended all violations of its border with Lebanon and that peacekeepers would be deployed southward on Wednesday, followed by Lebanese troops. Israel declared the end of its 22-year-occupation of southern Lebanon in May, but U.N. and Lebanese forces would not move in till border issues were resolved.</p>

        <p>VENEZUELA: CUBAN'S ARREST ORDERED  President Hugo Chavez has ordered the arrest of a man who says he is one of 1,500 Cuban intelligence agents sent by Fidel Castro to promote communism in Venezuela but now wants to defect. The detention order came in the heat of the campaign for the July 30 presidential election in which the friendship of Mr. Chavez, a left-leaning populist, with Mr. Castro has been criticized by opposition forces.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: LEFTIST OVERTURE  The leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, which had kept president-elect Vicente Fox at arms-length since the July 2 election, said it will seek a dialogue with Mr. Fox about major national issues. Mr. Fox needs an alliance with the left or with the defeated governing party if he is to pass congressional initiatives. It remained unclear whether leaders of the leftist party would agree to Mr. Fox's invitation to help him form his cabinet.</p>

        <p>KASHMIR: MILITANTS ANNOUNCE CEASE-FIRE  Four months after India said it was ready to talk to Kashmiri rebels if they abandoned violence, the Hizbul Mujahedeen unilaterally declared a three-month cease-fire and expressed willingness to negotiate with the Indian government. Hizbul Mujahedeen is the second militant group to declare a cease-fire. The Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front did so in 1994. About 30,000 people have died in the insurgency against Indian rule since 1990.</p>

        <p>MYANMAR: CLASSES RESUME  The military government allowed the full resumption of higher education, more than three years after closing down colleges and universities to stop anti-government demonstrations, in December 1996. Nearly 60,000 first-, second- and and third-year students in the arts and sciences began classes, following 20,000 fourth-year students who resumed courses June 27. Medical and engineering classes were reopened in stages starting in January 1999.</p>

        <p>INDIA: POLICE ON STRIKE  About 18,000 junior police officers in the eastern state of Bihar began a weeklong strike, demanding compensation for the families of officers killed in the line of duty since 1995, an end to political interference in the running of the police force and the renovation of police buildings. The state government has declared the strike illegal and suspended more than 150 officers.</p>

        <p>IVORY COAST: CONSTITUTION APPROVAL EXPECTED  Ivoirians continued to vote on a draft constitution that would determine the rules of coming elections a day after the military government extended voting to a second day because of widespread problems and delays. Early results indicated that the constitution, which all major parties endorsed, would be approved.</p>

        <p>MOZAMBIQUE: WAGE PROTEST  The country's largest trade federation threatened to hold a three-day strike this week if the government refuses to increase the minimum wage. The government offered to increase the minimum wage by 16 percent, to $34 a month. The federation, the Mozambican Workers' Organization, says that is inadequate and is demanding an increase of 30 percent.</p>
