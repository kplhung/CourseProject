        <p>There was something about Joey Pillot that made a federal prosecutor wonder whether he was telling the whole truth about his violent past, and the prosecutor told him so. Joey seemed uncomfortable, as if he was hiding something. There would be no deal, the prosecutor warned, if Joey did not come clean.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pillot, a member of a drug-and-extortion gang, sighed, then spilled out a startling story: Two innocent men were in prison for a murder that he had committed. Later, he conceded that his best friend, James Rodriguez, known as Spanky, had also been involved.</p>
        <p>That was six years ago. The men convicted of the crime, David Lemus and Olmado Hidalgo, are still in prison, serving sentences of 25 years to life for the murder of a bouncer at a Manhattan nightclub, the murder Mr. Pillot says he and his friend committed.</p>
        <p>It is a case that has frustrated lawyers for Mr. Lemus and Mr. Hidalgo, who said they had been certain their clients would be released, or at least granted a new trial. They acknowledge that some of the evidence points to their clients, but say that now there is much more evidence that Mr. Pillot and Mr. Rodriguez were the real killers.</p>
        <p>For Steven M. Cohen, the former assistant United States attorney who extracted the confession from Mr. Pillot, the intervening years have been troubling. Now in private practice, he wonders whether he did enough. ''This is the only case I left behind that keeps me up at night, that plays on my conscience,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''There are real questions about whether the right guys are in jail.''</p>
        <p>It is difficult to overturn a conviction in New York, even in the face of powerful new evidence. Trial judges and state appeals courts have always been reluctant to reverse a jury's verdict, and in 1996, Congress sharply limited the rights of defendants to take their appeals to federal court.</p>
        <p>In this case, a state judge in Manhattan refused to allow a new trial, saying he found Mr. Pillot's confession unbelievable, and state appeals courts refused to intervene. Lawyers filed an appeal in federal court two years ago, but they are not optimistic about its prospects.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Lemus, now 32, and Mr. Hidalgo, now 34, pace the yard at Green Haven Correctional Facility in Stormville, N.Y., seemingly as baffled as their lawyers. They guard against false hope now. Mr. Lemus, the only son of a single mother from the Bronx, is still able to summon tears if he is questioned closely about the course of his life. Mr. Hidalgo, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, where his wife and two children remain, has the lifeless eyes of one who long ago detached himself from the world.</p>
        <p>It is not lost on them that there is a wave of interest in death penalty cases. They can see it on the television set mounted in the prison yard; even the smallest irregularities are debated. But their case, with sentences just a notch less harsh, generates little interest, for all its contradictions and unanswered questions.</p>
        <p>Why, for instance, did the police think that two men who apparently did not know each other, who came from different worlds and spoke different languages -- Mr. Lemus only English and Mr. Hidalgo only Spanish -- would commit a murder together? And why, if he was innocent, did Mr. Lemus tell a girlfriend that he had committed the crime?</p>
        <p>Death at a Nightclub  Tips to Police Point In Two Directions</p>
        <p>It was Latin night at the Palladium on Thanksgiving in 1990, and more than 1,000 people showed up to drink and dance at the nightclub on East 14th Street. By 1 a.m., only a few bouncers remained outside. That is when the trouble started. A man left the club and argued with a bouncer, who punched him in the face.</p>
        <p>The man and his friends left, and at least two of them retrieved guns from their cars and returned. One fired a semiautomatic pistol, but it jammed. The other fired a revolver, hitting Jeffrey Craig, the security supervisor, in the leg. Another bullet ripped through the chest of Marcus Peterson, 23, a bouncer and an aspiring bodybuilder. He died, but Mr. Craig survived.</p>
        <p>The shooting was widely reported, and within hours, the police got their first tip. An anonymous caller to their Crime Stoppers line said that Spanky and Joey, from 550 East  139th Street in the Bronx, had done it. That was the address of the C &amp; C gang, a group of violent extortionists. The police briefly looked into Mr. Rodriguez, a C &amp; C member, and one of the bouncers identified him from a photograph as one of the gunmen.</p>
        <p>But a few days later, another tip sent the police in a different direction. A woman who had been picked up on prostitution charges told the police that her friend knew who had committed the Palladium shooting. So the police interviewed the friend, Delores Spencer, a married mother of three. The man she was having an affair with, she said, had told her that he had done it. That man was David Lemus.</p>
        <p>So the police compiled a photo array and showed it to four of the bouncers. Two picked out Mr. Lemus. About two months after the shooting, he was picked up and put in a lineup. Three bouncers, including Mr. Craig, the survivor, identified him; three others said they could not. Mr. Lemus was charged with murder.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the police showed four bouncers a set of photographs that included Mr. Hidalgo. Neither the detectives nor prosecutors have ever explained why they thought he was involved. Three bouncers picked out Mr. Hidalgo, but a fourth picked out another man.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lemus and Mr. Hidalgo said they rejected plea bargains for shorter prison terms. They told their lawyers that they had never even seen each other until they were brought to court. And each said he had not been at the Palladium on the night of the murder -- and had alibi witnesses to prove it.</p>
        <p>Two years after the shooting, their trial began, but the defense cases quickly fell apart.</p>
        <p>Mr. Craig testified that he was now certain that Mr. Hidalgo was one of the gunmen. He said he had no doubt that Mr. Lemus was the other. Two years earlier, Mr. Craig had said only that Mr. Lemus could have been one of the gunmen.</p>
        <p>Three other bouncers identified the defendants, but their accounts differed in some key details, like who was wearing what. And one reversed the roles that each had supposedly played. Several said that both gunmen had slight Spanish accents. Mr. Lemus speaks like a native New Yorker. And three bouncers said they believed there had been a third gunman, although they disagreed about whether he had fired his gun.</p>
        <p>But all the bouncers agreed on what had led up to the shooting. A man who had come with a group of friends left the club, and asked for permission to go to his car and then re-enter. The bouncer refused, the man shoved him, and the bouncer punched him. The man's friends came outside, the whole party left, and at least two men returned with guns.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spencer's testimony was devastating. She said that Mr. Lemus had left a message on her answering machine after the shooting, saying, ''Call me, I'm in trouble.'' She did not, however, save the tape. When she called him, he said he had shot a bouncer at the Palladium, she testified. But the account he gave her was quite different from that of the bouncers: He had been at the club with another woman, and the trouble started inside the club when someone pinched her buttocks. He got into a fight and was thrown out.</p>
        <p>Then the prosecution produced a knockout punch. After Mr. Lemus was charged with murder, he kept calling Ms. Spencer, unaware that she had spoken to the police. She was frightened, she said, because he kept demanding that she come to his house alone. So she arranged with investigators to tape his calls secretly. The hour or so of recordings contained no such demands, just banter and flirtation, except for an exchange in which she said, ''Why should I be afraid of you?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lemus answered, ''Because you know that I know that you know,'' and made three popping sounds. She said it was a reference to the shooting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lemus's lawyer, Eric M. Sears, asked that he be allowed to play another portion of Ms. Spencer's tape, in which Mr. Lemus said that he stood to win a large legal settlement because he had been jailed for a crime he did not commit. The judge refused.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lemus's alibi defense fell through, Mr. Sears said, because the girlfriend who he said was at home with him on Thanksgiving night had given contradictory accounts to the police and would not have made a convincing witness. Several of Mr. Lemus's friends had stopped by that night, Mr. Sears added, but their testimony would have forced him to put the girlfriend on the witness stand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hidalgo was in equally bad shape. Just before closing arguments were to begin, his lawyer, Andres Aranda, said he had two alibi witnesses, explaining that he had been unable to locate them earlier. But Justice Jay Gold of State Supreme Court in Manhattan said it was too late.</p>
        <p>The jury deliberated for a day before convicting both men of second-degree murder.</p>
        <p>Behind Bars  Talking a Thug Life And Paying the Price</p>
        <p>It is no mystery to David Lemus why a jury convicted him. He had contributed a good share of the evidence. But, in his view, it is a great injustice that he is still in prison. He is guilty, he says, only of being an immature jerk and a braggart.</p>
        <p>He was 22 when he boasted to Delores Spencer that he had been involved in the Palladium shooting. She was eight years older, and ''liked the gangster type and thugs,'' he said, ''and I portrayed myself as one.'' In reality, he said, he had seen a report about the shooting on television.</p>
        <p>He has been in prison for nearly seven years now, and no one visits or writes anymore, except for his mother, Nilsa Huertas. Perhaps not surprisingly, she says he was a good son, except for the time when he was 16 and was caught driving a stolen car. Ms. Huertas's right wrist bears the scars of a suicide attempt shortly after he was convicted of the murder; she says she is better now.</p>
        <p>Last year, she was allowed to visit her son for a weekend. They shared a trailer with a little kitchen, took long walks on the prison grounds and watched movies on a VCR. He made the mistake, he said, of showing her ''The Shawshank Redemption,'' in which an innocent man is imprisoned for life. She cried for 12 hours.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hidalgo seems to have found a way to cope with the long, empty days. He rarely hears from anyone, and no one visits. Relatives in New York send money to his family in the Dominican Republic now; he used to send them about $300 a month. He, too, was not a saint, having been arrested twice for illegal possession of a gun.</p>
        <p>They are good friends now, Mr. Hidalgo having assumed the role of elder brother, helping Mr. Lemus to keep the good news and the bad in perspective.</p>
        <p>Surprise Admission  A Gang Member Lies To Protect a Friend</p>
        <p>The C &amp; C Gang controlled every aspect of life around Brook Avenue and 139th Street in the Bronx in the early 1990's, enforcing its rules with murders and kidnappings.</p>
        <p>When a state and federal task force began rounding up C &amp; C members, it fell to Mr. Cohen, the federal prosecutor, and Robert Addolorato, a veteran New York City police detective, to interview Joey Pillot. They were trying to decide whether to offer him a plea bargain in exchange for his testimony against other gang members. Over several days in 1994, Mr. Pillot admitted to two murders and an assortment of other gang-related crimes.</p>
        <p>''I remember saying to him,'' Mr. Cohen recalled, '' 'Whatever it is that you think we will never find out, you had better tell us now, because if you don't, and we find out, I promise you that you will spend the rest of your life in prison.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pillot replied, ''You mean the Palladium murder,'' Mr. Cohen recalled.</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' Mr. Cohen said, ''tell me about that.'' He had never heard of the Palladium murder.</p>
        <p>At first Mr. Pillot said he had done it alone, but later conceded that his best friend, Spanky Rodriguez, had been the gunman. His own gun had jammed, Mr. Pillot said. He had lied, he said, to protect Spanky.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen said he and Detective Addolorato became convinced that Mr. Pillot was telling the truth. He knew details, like the jamming of the  gun and its caliber, that only a participant would be likely to know. And he had implicated his closest friend.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Mr. Cohen contacted Stephen Saracco, the assistant district attorney who had prosecuted Mr. Lemus and Mr. Hidalgo, and Mr. Saracco told the defense lawyers, who were granted a new hearing before Justice Gold in 1996.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pillot testified that he and some friends had gone to the Palladium on Thanksgiving in 1990, and that Spanky had had too much to drink. Spanky left the club, and a bouncer would not let him re-enter. The bouncer finally punched Spanky.</p>
        <p>The group, four men and four women, went to their cars, Mr. Pillot said, and he and Spanky returned with their guns. Mr. Pillot said his misfired, but Spanky's did not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pillot's wife, Millie, testified that she had been there, too, and the judge peppered her with questions about the bands that had performed and the songs they had sung. She said she did not remember. And two C &amp; C members testified that Mr. Pillot had admitted his involvement shortly after the shooting.</p>
        <p>The judge asked both sides to submit briefs. Mr. Sears pointed out the call to the Crime Stoppers line six years earlier that had named Joey and Spanky. And he argued that there was ''absolutely no motive'' for Mr. Pillot to confess to a crime that he did not commit, or to implicate his best friend on behalf of two men he said he had never met.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saracco, the prosecutor, argued that Mr. Pillot had made up the whole story, and had gotten many details wrong. Mr. Pillot said, for instance, that he and Spanky ran from the scene after the shooting, while witnesses said the gunmen had walked away. Mr. Pillot's story, Mr. Saracco wrote, could have been concocted from reports relayed to him by a gang member who had met Mr. Lemus in prison. And Mr. Pillot, Mr. Saracco argued, believed he had a deal with Mr. Cohen and would not be prosecuted, and therefore had nothing to lose. (Mr. Pillot, in fact, never got an immunity deal from federal prosecutors.)</p>
        <p>Justice Gold agreed. He called the testimony of Mr. Pillot and his wife ''entirely unworthy of belief.'' Mr. Pillot, the judge wrote, had confessed to placate Mr. Cohen. Justice Gold would neither set the defendants free nor order a new trial.</p>
        <p>Not much has happened in the case over the last four years, except that prosecutors changed their argument about Mr. Pillot's testimony, and seem to give it some credence. In a brief filed in federal court last year, they said there was ''no dispute'' that Mr. Rodriguez -- who was picked out of a photo lineup in 1990 but never charged -- was involved in the shooting. Mr. Pillot, they said, could have learned the details of the shooting from his friend.</p>
        <p>Nancy E. Little, a Legal Aid Society lawyer who is handling the appeal, said prosecutors were scrambling to make the new evidence fit. ''They came up with a new theory to plug up one gap, but in doing so they opened up all these other gaps,'' she said. One of the biggest is the lack of explanation for how Mr. Rodriguez knew either Mr. Lemus or Mr. Hidalgo, or how Mr. Lemus and Mr. Hidalgo knew each other, she said.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Sears met with Mr. Saracco to discuss an immunity offer for Mr. Rodriguez. His testimony could reopen the case. Mr. Rodriguez's lawyer, Richard Verchick, said his client would testify in return for a promise that he would not be prosecuted, but no such offer has been made.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez, who was convicted of extortion in 1996 for his role in the C &amp; C gang, is to be released from federal prison in Fort Dix, N.J., on Nov. 3. Mr. Pillot, who pleaded guilty to a gang-related murder in 1996, is serving a sentence of 15 years to life at the Shawangunk Correctional Facility in Wallkill, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan district attorney's office is willing to review any new evidence in the case, said James M. Kindler, the chief assistant district attorney. He would not comment on discussions regarding Mr. Rodriguez.</p>
        <p>There is little the defendants and their lawyers can do but wait.</p>
        <p>Correction:  January 25, 2006, Wednesday  An article on Oct. 20 about the reversal of David Lemus's conviction in the 1990 killing of a bouncer at the Palladium nightclub in Manhattan misspelled the given name of his co-defendant, who had also been cleared. (The error, which is in the indictment, also appeared in more than a dozen articles on the case from 2000 to 2005.) He is Olmedo Hidalgo, not Olmado. An article on Aug. 20 about the dismissal of charges against Mr. Hidalgo misstated the timing of a judge's reversal of his conviction. That took place on July 29, not on Aug. 19. These errors were discovered last week during research for an article on later developments.</p>
