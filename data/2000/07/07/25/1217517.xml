        <p>In a city that takes theater very seriously, Kama Ginkas was arguably the most successful director of the season that just ended. He certainly was the busiest.</p>
        <p>Five of his plays were staged through the year, each one in its own way a hit. His ''Pushkin.Duel.Death'' was considered the best original work to come out of last year's nationwide Pushkin extravaganza. This spring he picked up a Golden Mask prize for ''A Room of Laughter,'' a popular one-act play that he directed for Oleg Tabakov's studio. And the premiere last fall of ''The Black Monk,'' a striking dramatization of Chekhov's mystical short story,  dazzled even Moscow's jaded critics.</p>
        <p>''My opinion is that Ginkas has hit his peak,'' said John Freedman, an American scholar and critic of the Russian theater. ''He is racing to keep up with his abilities.''</p>
        <p>By early summer Mr. Ginkas, 59, was rehearsing another play, based on Oscar Wilde's ''Happy Prince.'' Watching Mr. Ginkas in rehearsal is like watching his actors perform: the process begins and ends with an intensity that radiates both heat and clarity. No detail, no object, no movement is too small to escape his attention; every prop, every gesture, takes on meaning.</p>
        <p>''Your fingers!'' he shouted during one rehearsal, pointing accusingly to an actress's right hand. ''Your fingers are moving. That makes it a mise en scene, a fact. It could mean many things. It could mean you are bored.''</p>
        <p>Boredom is not something Mr. Ginkas usually worries about. His plays are not the kind that let the audience off the hook. For one thing, audience and actors are typically packed into small spaces. In ''the Black Monk,'' the stage is put on the theater's upper balcony, with the audience wrapped around three sides. Two of his other plays are staged in a rehearsal room, with the audience acting as a prop. ''A Room of Laughter'' takes place on the main stage, but in a box.</p>
        <p>But mostly it is a very human drama that keeps the audience's attention riveted as Mr. Ginkas works his way in and around the emotionally dense landscape of his characters, some of them drawn from masterpieces of Russian literature and moments of Russian history.</p>
        <p>''My plays arouse catharsis, shock, even hysteria, but there are viewers who would rather not be touched,'' he said. ''I can't say that I am speaking to the whole of humanity, or even all of Russia, or Moscow, but I am speaking to the audience of those people for whom these things are interesting.'' Whether it is the tortured tragedy of the Dostoyevskian character of Katerina Ivanovna in ''K. I. From Crime'' or the complex mesh of grand and petty motives that drove Russia's greatest poet to his death in ''Pushkin.Duel.Death,'' his plays ensnare the spectator the way a spider's web catches a fly. In ''The Black Monk'' the audience is left poised on the edge of a balcony, gazing into the blackness of a theater that becomes the haunt of a mysterious creature who is either a source of genius, of madness or both.</p>
        <p>''For Ginkas, indifference is a catastrophe,'' says Anatoly Smelyansky, a scholar of the Russian theater, who is head of the Moscow Arts Theater school studio. ''He has been playing this game for many years. It is always a bit of a game: some naturalism, some aspect of real life, and characters that he stretches to their limit. For all of this love of theatrics, jokes and games, he has a taste for reality, for the raw stuff of life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ginkas's characters are intense but they are also nuanced, which he says is one of the legacies he inherited from his first teacher, the great Leningrad director Georgi Tovstonogov. ''He found humor in tragic moments,'' Mr. Ginkas said. ''There was realism, but the eccentricities were all inside.''</p>
        <p>Born Jewish in Lithuania on the eve of the Nazi occupation, Mr. Ginkas was one of a handful of children who were saved from being shipped off to Auschwitz. He is also a cultural survivor, one of the few members of a generation of Soviet theater directors who came of age just as the Khruschchev-era ''thaw'' was coming to an end, and who managed to stick it out.</p>
        <p>''My generation started work at the end of the 1960's, at the end of the thaw,'' he said. ''We were not shot; we were not sent into exile, but we were battered by shrapnel. Many simply left the profession and did something else. Many were so strongly poisoned that they never worked to their potential. Those before us managed to accomplish something during the 'thaw,' before getting hit on the head. We were like idiots. We rushed right out, stuck our necks out, and wham -- we got hit before we even had a chance to do anything.''</p>
        <p>As a child Mr. Ginkas survived because his parents managed to hide him in a Roman Catholic convent. As an individualist in the Brezhnev era, he also lay low, ducking the radar of Soviet cultural orthodoxy. For a time he was a director of a state theater in Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, but even there his free spirit was more than the authorities could tolerate. He returned to Leningrad, where he staged shows in private apartments and built a reputation as a theatrical dissident.</p>
        <p>At the first glimmering of cultural liberalization in the early 1980's, he was lured to Moscow, where he was invited to the Moscow Art Theater and Mossoviet, before settling at the Young Spectators Theater where his wife, Genrietta Yanovskaya, was made artistic director.</p>
        <p>As a student of Mr. Tovstonogov, Mr. Ginkas is firmly fixed in the great Russian tradition of psychological theater, which began with Konstantin Stanislavsky and Vsevolod Meyerhold. Their photographs -- together with portraits of Joseph Brodsky and Andrei Sakharov -- adorn the office at the Young Spectators Theater that he shares with his wife.</p>
        <p>''Stanislavsky, Meyerhold, Vakhtangov, they were the titans,'' he said. ''Then there were the gods: Tovstonogov, Yuri Lyubimov'' (director of the Taganka Theater). ''The task of the gods was different. The titans had to create the foundations, to create heaven and earth from the cosmos. Our generation is the heroes: our job is to conserve and refine, make it more usable, combine the uncombinable.''</p>
        <p>After spending several years abroad, mostly in Helsinki, Mr. Ginkas returned to Moscow in 1994 with a production of ''K. I. From Crime,''  a disturbing and moving play about a character in ''Crime and Punishment''; in 1997 it won a prize at France's theater festival in Avignon.</p>
        <p>''We are watching what happens to a person,'' Mr. Ginkas explained. ''It is not clear whether she is insane or if the actress is provoking the audience. There are circuslike movements, but she is no clown. There is an element of the game, but it is nuanced and paradoxical.''</p>
        <p>Having survived its long bout with Socialist Realism, Russian theater is now emerging -- battered but not defeated -- from its first decade of laissez-faire capitalism.</p>
        <p>With more than 100 theaters in Moscow alone -- and another 400 in the rest of the country -- Russian theater has survived, in large part because Russians refuse to let it die. ''There were several times when Russian theater should have fallen flat on its face, but it has survived every crisis with flying colors,'' said Mr. Freedman, who is the theater critic for the English-language Moscow Times. ''Russians cannot imagine themselves without theater.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ginkas describes theater as one of Russia's few ''brand-name'' products. ''Theater is one of the few things we can still export,'' he said. ''Russian theater is like Sony. It is still the real thing.''</p>
