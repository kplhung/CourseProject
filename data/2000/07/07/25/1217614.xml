        <p>Pete Mickeal was embarrassed, disturbed and worried. Fifty-five players had been selected in the National Basketball Association draft and he was not one of them.</p>
        <p>Everyone, from family members to his agent to potential future employers, had told him he would be picked somewhere between the late first round and the middle of the second round. And here he was about to go undrafted.</p>
        <p>Exasperated, Mickeal could not take it anymore. He ran out of the room where he had been watching the draft on television and stewed.</p>
        <p>''Going through that was probably the worst experience I ever went through,'' said Mickeal, who was chosen by the Dallas Mavericks as the 58th and final pick of the draft. ''Just sitting there, watching TV, knowing your name's going to be called, but not knowing where. Then they got down to 50 and I was like, 'Dang, is my name going to get called at all?'</p>
        <p>''I left the room after the 55th pick and came back just before the 58th. I was looking at the screen, just mad. I'm mad at the screen now. I ain't mad at nobody but the TV screen. I'm staring the TV screen down hard, man. And when they said my name, it was anger.</p>
        <p>''I was just ready to come do this. That's all it meant was that I got to start all over again and prove myself again like I always have.''</p>
        <p>Only 45 minutes after the draft, Mickeal was traded to the Knicks, along with Erick Strickland, for John Wallace and Donnell Harvey. Three weeks later, at Shaw's Pro Summer League in Boston last week, the 6-foot-5-inch Mickeal, a forward from the University of Cincinnati, began to prove himself to the Knicks.</p>
        <p>Against the Nets on Friday night, Mickeal had one of his best games of the tournament. He scored 13 points in 24 minutes on 5-of-6 shooting and added three assists, two rebounds and one steal.</p>
        <p>In the six games Mickeal played last week, he averaged 11 points (54.6 percent shooting), 3.8 rebounds and 23.7 minutes. But statistics do not fully define Mickeal's game. His athleticism, tenacity and defense have impressed the Knicks' coaches.</p>
        <p>''Pete played terrific,'' Tom Thibodeau, a Knicks assistant who is serving as the head coach of the summer league team, said after the Knicks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 67-57, last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''He played good sound defense, helped us execute and facilitated the offense. He's an intangible guy. He can hit some spot-up shots, get some garbage points around the basket, run the floor. He's not going to take bad shots. He's going to do things that he can and he's not going to get you beat. He's not a mistake player.''</p>
        <p>Thibodeau linked Mickeal, who had 6 points, 4 rebounds and a steal in 19 minutes Wednesday, with the 39th player the Knicks drafted: Lavor Postell, the former St. John's standout.</p>
        <p>While Mickeal impressed quietly last week, doing the little things like diving for loose balls and grabbing a few key rebounds, Postell piled up the points. After posting 20 points in the tournament opener against the Milwaukee Bucks on July 17, he ended up averaging 15.8 points (42.4 percentage) and 3.2 rebounds in 27.7 minutes a game.</p>
        <p>Postell and Mickeal appear to be the only players on last week's roster with a chance to play for the Knicks during the regular season. If the Knicks re-sign the power forward Kurt Thomas and do not make a trade, they will have 10 roster spots filled. That will leave at least two slots open.</p>
        <p>Postell, a 6-6 shooting guard with quickness, toughness and a decent outside shot, has a solid chance of sticking. It will be tougher for Mickeal because he is an undersized small forward, and the Knicks, assuming they remain as they are and keep Postell, have six players under 6-7.</p>
        <p>But the Knicks' coaches believe Postell and Mickeal will enliven their practices and make the team's star swingmen, Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston, better by playing aggressively against them.</p>
        <p>''The one thing that I do know is that he and Lavor can bring something to practice,'' Thibodeau said. ''They have a good intensity about them. They're smart. They pick up things quickly, and when you have guys like that, it adds to your practice. And they're both fierce competitors. I think that could help Allan and Latrell, having two young guys that really get after them every day.''</p>
        <p>Mickeal, with the ability to penetrate nicely and the lack of a great outside shooting touch, sometimes resembles a poor man's Sprewell. Mickeal is a big fan of the Knicks' star and, whether he is simply making a smart public relations move or telling the truth, he said he has been a Knicks fan since his days as a youngster in Rock Island, Ill.</p>
        <p>After working his way through Indian Hills Community College in Iowa, where he was named national junior college player of the year in 1998, and playing strongly for two years at Cincinnati, he said it would be a dream realized to make the Knicks' squad.</p>
        <p>''I like the Knicks because the Garden is just a historical place, and just getting an opportunity to play alongside Sprewell,'' Mickeal said. ''I love to play with his type of energy.''</p>
        <p>If Mickeal is lucky, he will get an opportunity to try to match Sprewell's energy during the Knicks' practices at SUNY-Purchase.</p>
