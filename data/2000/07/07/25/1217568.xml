        <p>Since 1988 the two government agencies that track airline delays have underestimated the amount of time lost by passengers by a total of 247 years, according to a study scheduled to be released today.</p>
        <p>The report by the Department of Transportation's inspector general found that the major airlines increased their scheduled flight times on hundreds of routes over the last decade in order to improve their on-time statistics. As a result, 130 million minutes of extra travel time was tacked on to airline schedules between 1988 and 1999, the study found, even before counting delays, which have soared over the corresponding period.</p>
        <p>The report was requested last summer by Senator Richard C. Shelby, a Republican from Alabama who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, after the country experienced the worst airline delays in history. This summer has turned out to be even worse.</p>
        <p>The report is sure to fuel the growing debate about an air system that many say is approaching gridlock.</p>
        <p>Senator Shelby asked the inspector general to examine what causes flight delays and cancellations, a question often asked by tens of thousands of frustrated travelers. But the report, which is scheduled to be released at a hearing of his subcommittee today, concluded that the government does not collect enough information about the causes of delays to answer the question.</p>
        <p>It also found that the conflicting ways that the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation define delays has made it impossible for the government and the airlines to agree on what causes them.</p>
        <p>The airlines blame the F.A.A. and weather for most delays, while the F.A.A. cites weather and the high number of flights as the main culprits.</p>
        <p>''It shouldn't be a surprise that they are having a hard time coming up with what the solutions are when they can't figure out what the causes are,'' Mr. Shelby said in an interview.</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. has acknowledged the problem and is in the process of coming up with a new method to more accurately measure delays and their causes. In addition, the latest Congressional appropriation bill ordered the Transportation Department to compel the airlines to disclose more accurate information about why planes are late and why flights are canceled.</p>
        <p>Currently, the F.A.A. says a plane is delayed if it takes off 15 minutes or more after the pilot radios a request to the tower to taxi out to the runway. If the plane sits at the gate for an hour before asking for clearance to taxi, it is not considered late.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the Transportation Department counts a plane as delayed if it leaves or arrives at the gate within 15 minutes of its scheduled departure and arrival time. If the plane sits on the tarmac for an hour but arrives at its scheduled time, it is not considered late.</p>
        <p>Airlines say that they have stretched their schedules to account for the inefficiency of the country's aging air traffic control system and to make their schedules more predictable for passengers. And they do not hide the practice. United Airlines, the UAL unit that has been plagued by delays, recently announced that it was adding an average of four minutes to each of its 2,400 daily flights.</p>
        <p>Yet the report found that airline delays last year would have been 25 percent higher, as calculated by the Transportation Department, if the airlines had kept the scheduled flight times they used in 1988.</p>
        <p>And despite the airlines' efforts to make planes appear on time, delays grew 11 percent between 1995 and 1999, according to the F.A.A. About 83 percent of those delays were on the ground, the report found, up from 60 percent in 1996. Ground delays of an hour or more have also become more frequent, increasing 130 percent in the last five years, the report found.</p>
        <p>Cancellations have also soared over the period, growing 68 percent. Certain routes -- like those between Newark and Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and Washington and Boston -- had cancellation rates that were more than five times the national average of 2.8 percent last year.</p>
        <p>''Without good causal data,'' the report concluded, ''it is unlikely that the current debate within the aviation community will end, nor the increasing number of flight delays and cancellations.''</p>
