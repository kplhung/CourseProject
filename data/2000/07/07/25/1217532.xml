        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Tobacco's New Best Friend,'' by Jacob Sullum (Op-Ed, July 20):</p>
        <p>I agree with Mr. Sullum when he asserts that government is an ally of the tobacco industry, but this has long been true. Although the tobacco industry appeared to fight the congressionally mandated warning labels that began appearing on cigarette packs in 1965, the industry was well aware that these labels would shield them from liability for their deceptive marketing practices, and that they would have no beneficial effect on public health.</p>
        <p>The Department of Agriculture has long been an avid promoter of tobacco exports to the developing world. Although Mr. Sullum doesn't specify what it is that the tobacco companies give ''in return'' to their devoted customers, let me make it clear: it is premature disease and death.</p>
