        <p>Is the perfect golf swing, that elusive marriage of grace and strength that separates the duffer from the pro, about to yield its secrets to science?</p>
        <p>Unlikely, but researchers at the University of Chicago, using brain-imaging equipment, are studying how professional golfers prepare to swing, in the hope that it will help in physical rehabilitation.</p>
        <p>Last weekend, volunteers from the L.P.G.A. Tour, in Chicago for a tournament, agreed to let doctors examine them with M.R.I.'s while the players visualized their swing. The machines track small movements of blood in the brain, and researchers say they hope the study will allow them to understanding the nature of rapid body movement.</p>
        <p>The test requires the subjects to remain still. ''We have to study an aspect of movement, without the person moving,'' said Dr. John G. Milton, a neurology professor at the university.</p>
        <p>The researchers hit on the idea of using golfers because the best ones are known to fully visualize their swing before they hit the ball. Indeed, said Dr. Milton, who has played golf for six years, the swing is so fast that golfers have no time to reposition themselves once it has begun.</p>
        <p>''That meant to me that everything has to be preprogrammed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Researchers plan to examine three groups of women: the pro golfers, competent amateur ones and those who have never hit a golf ball, Dr. Milton said.</p>
        <p>Members of the third group will then be given golf lessons for 16 weeks and re-examined, to see if there are any change in their brain patterns.</p>
