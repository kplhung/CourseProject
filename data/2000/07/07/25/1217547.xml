        <p>The two blond women with the tousled Frederic Fekkai haircuts were looking at snapshots over customized Cobbs (hold the ham, hold the cucumber, hold the avocado) at Millie's Place, the salads chased by iced tea, two Equals apiece.</p>
        <p>''Does she look good or does she look good?'' asked the first woman, a  48-year-old grandmother, who asked to remain nameless.</p>
        <p>''Adorable,'' said her 50-year-old, anonymity-seeking friend. ''So, how was Aspen?''</p>
        <p>''Aspen was January. We're just back from Napa. So, are you loving this picture?''</p>
        <p>''Beautiful. And what is she wearing?''</p>
        <p>''Dior.''</p>
        <p>''How old is she now?''</p>
        <p>''Six months.''</p>
        <p>This exchange took place at the Americana shopping center in Manhasset, N.Y., on Long Island's North Shore. Please don't say mall, though. The Americana at Manhasset is to ''mall'' as upper Madison Avenue is to Market Street in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Comparisons don't obtain.</p>
        <p>For starters, there are few places in America where a handsome middle-aged woman dressed for a morning of tennis followed by light lunch and some shopping would not appear conspicuous wearing a crocodile Hermes belt ($1,495) over Ralph Lauren microfiber shorts ($95), a Jil Sander T-shirt ($300), a cotton sweater from Lacoste ($155), tan crocodile driving shoes from Tod's ($1,500) and carrying a beige alligator Kelly bag ($7,000). Even the woman's gold Rolex Oyster Perpetual Datejust ($15,900) was worn with the insouciance most folks might associate with a Timex.</p>
        <p>But the Americana is not a most-folks destination. It is, as its developer, Frank Castagna, said, the ''premiere shopping destination on Long Island.'' With its limestone facade, designed by the society architect Peter Marino; its swathes of meadow flowers and grasses, arranged by the modish landscape architects Oehme, van Sweden &amp; Associates; its 225,000 square feet of retail space devoted almost exclusively to luxury brands; the Americana has become an alternate Madison Avenue, a mini Rodeo Drive, the parking lot where America's economic steamroller gets its ticket stamped.</p>
        <p>''We're an off-the-radar oasis,'' said Deirdre Major, a spokeswoman for the Castagna Realty Company, although the Americana hasn't quite slipped the attention of Prada, Escada, Burberry, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and Max Mara, which all maintain stores there, or of Louis Vuitton, whose Americana outpost averages annual sales ''in the millions of dollars,'' a spokesman said.</p>
        <p>The Americana's tenants include not merely such traditional carriage trade retailers as Tiffany &amp; Company and Christofle, but also the members of the luxury pack currently dominating fashion retailing in the United States. Giorgio Armani opened a new franchise there just three weeks ago. Fendi and Hermes are both planning new boutiques for the fall. Hirshleifer's, the venerable retailer specializing in high-end apparel from Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel, is undergoing renovation to triple its selling space. And the accessories designer Kate Spade is also in the process of opening a stand-alone shop. It probably says something about a bull market that her location was formerly occupied by a bank.</p>
        <p>The Americana, said John Slavinsky, a senior vice president for Vuitton, ''is absolutely the best place to have a freestanding store on Long Island, bar none.'' It doesn't require a business degree from Wharton to understand the rationale for this, when even babies are wearing Dior.</p>
        <p>''It's crazy,'' said Christina Makowsky, the owner of a Northern Boulevard boutique, Georgina, that is what you might call Americana-adjacent. ''You can't believe the money people are throwing around these days. It's liquid millions. Even if you're rich, you're poor.''</p>
        <p>Of the 250 richest American towns recently cited by Worth magazine, 12 in the top 50 are a short drive from the Americana. The average household income of an Americana customer hovers around $125,000, Ms. Major said. But surely, as one shop owner remarked, that is too modest: ''Maybe it's the salary for the maid.''</p>
        <p>Even as Nassau County wrangles with the state for a financial bailout, the Americana delivers Prada platform shoes and Gucci lug soles and Vuitton pastel logo bags to what Kiki Nolan, the manager for Thomas Pink at the Americana, called, ''the richest people on Long Island,'' the ones that ''you see at all the charity parties, the grand parties, the famous rich families of Long Island.'' Plenty of the Americana's customers seem to bypass fame, however, and head straight to rich.</p>
        <p>''Communities have changed,'' said Steven B. Greenberg, of the Greenberg Group, retail consultants  whose clients include Gucci. ''Long Island's old guard has sold many of those old homes. The land has been subdivided. Instead of one $10 million home, you have a lot of $3 million homes owned by people in their 30's and 40's.''</p>
        <p>These people don't want to venture to Manhattan, he went on. ''They want to buy luxury, but in a convenient setting.'' Consequently, rents approach $200 a square foot, a price  unsurpassed in any suburban setting in America, Mr. Greenberg said. ''That's right up there with the top shopping streets in America, but the volumes warrant it,'' he said. Retailers can realize a return of $1,000 a square foot, he added, although industry journals peg the figure closer to $850. Still, that is triple the average return at a mainstream mall.</p>
        <p>It wasn't always so lucrative. ''We had a disjointed center,'' said Mr. Castagna, whose family construction firm also built the Nassau Coliseum and the cell blocks at Rikers Island. When Mr. Castagna bought the land that would become the Americana from the developer William Levitt in 1956, he optimistically incorporated the new center as the Fifth Avenue of Long Island. As it turned out, he was off by an avenue and several decades. Among the early tenants were a Magic Pan and Baker's Shoes.</p>
        <p>''At a certain point,'' he added, ''we did a study and discovered that the land was more valuable with no buildings on it. We started a major move then to go in this direction.'' The direction was luxury. As it happens, the economy was headed that way, too.</p>
        <p>And now, ''the silent cash register is always ringing, silently,'' said a former buyer for Federated Department Stores, which in 1996 opened a $100 million specialty wing of its Bloomingdale's satellite at the Roosevelt Field mall to compete with Americana's luxury brands. ''You walk into some of the stores,'' the buyer added, ''and they're empty. But they've already done $50,000 that morning, selling sweaters to women who get bored at home and say, 'Let's order some stuff up.' ''</p>
        <p>The typical Americana consumer, added Lori Hirshleifer Sills, scion of a retailing business begun at the turn of the century in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, ''is very high end. She's a 16 year old who comes to us for Gucci belts and accessories, and she's a woman in her 70's who's buying Chanel.'' She is a woman, said Josh Patner, a co-designer for Tuleh, a label that will soon have its own miniboutique in Hirshleifer's, ''with a gorgeous car, a gorgeous home, who loves to look like a woman, and who is married to a man who loves women to look like women.'' There is one Hirshleifer's customer, Mr. Patner said, who owns ''sapphires that match her Rolls.'' What retailer, he added, could ask for more?</p>
