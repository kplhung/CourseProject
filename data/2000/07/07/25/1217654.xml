        <p>For the first time since the onset of the Asian financial crisis in late 1997, major South Korean banks had their credit ratings raised to investment grade, making it easier and less expensive for the banks to raise fresh capital overseas and improve their financial condition. Moody's Investors Service raised the credit ratings of Kookmin, H&amp;CB and Shinhan banks to investment grade, improving their long-term senior debt and deposit ratings to Baa3 from Ba1. Although the credit ratings of Hanvit, Korea Exchange, Cho Hung, KorAm and Korea First banks were also raised, they are still short of investment grade.</p>
