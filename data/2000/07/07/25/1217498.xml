        <p>Alzheimer's disease, which robs people of their most basic neurological functions, may give subtle clues to its approach years before clear symptoms emerge.</p>
        <p>A recent study in The Archives of Neurology suggests that cognitive tests may allow doctors to know if a patient is developing the disease. While there is no treatment for Alzheimer's now, the technique could be useful as drugs become available.</p>
        <p>The author of the report, Dr. Merrill F. Elias of the University of Maine, drew on data compiled in the Framingham Heart Study, the 52-year health assessment of residents of Framingham, Mass.</p>
        <p>From 1975 to 1979, as part of the study, psychologists gave a number of tests meant to gauge the participants' brain functions.</p>
        <p>The study participants were tested for learning and immediate recall, visual reproduction from memory and abstract reasoning.</p>
        <p>At the time, all appeared free of Alzheimer's disease. But those who developed the disease later, researchers found, were more likely to have had lower test results in the cognitive studies. Less retention of verbal material and lower abstract reasoning were the strongest predictors, the report said.</p>
        <p>The journal noted, however, that the lower scores did not necessarily mean a person would develop Alzheimer's.</p>
