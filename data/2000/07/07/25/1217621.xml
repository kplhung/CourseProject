        <p>Two independent Los Angeles agencies that are coincidentally in the same office building -- Asher &amp; Partners and Italia/Gal Advertising -- are merging to form Asher/Gal &amp; Partners. Terms of the stock deal are not being disclosed.</p>
        <p>The merger comes after Asher resigned one large account, the antismoking campaign for the Tobacco Control Section of the California Department of Health Services, and lost another, Suzuki automobiles, to the Colby Effler &amp; Partners unit of Dentsu in Santa Monica, Calif. Asher had about 80 employees and Italia/ Gal, 40; the merged shop will have about 100.</p>

        <p>Two independent Los Angeles agencies that are coincidentally in the same office building -- Asher &amp; Partners and Italia/Gal Advertising -- are merging to form Asher/Gal &amp; Partners. Terms of the stock deal are not being disclosed.</p>
        <p>The merger comes after Asher resigned one large account, the antismoking campaign for the Tobacco Control Section of the California Department of Health Services, and lost another, Suzuki automobiles, to the Colby Effler &amp; Partners unit of Dentsu in Santa Monica, Calif. Asher had about 80 employees and Italia/ Gal, 40; the merged shop will have about 100.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Gal, 43, chairman and chief executive at Italia/Gal, is president and chief executive at Asher/ Gal. Hal Asher, 60, chairman and chief executive at Asher, is chairman at Asher/Gal. Joel Hochberg, 60, president and chief operating officer at Asher, is leaving to open his own consulting company, AdHoch Consulting, with Asher/Gal as a client. Other Asher/Gal partners include these partners at Asher: Darryl Asher; Leah Mitchell, media services; and Barry Schoenfeld, business development.</p>
        <p>Combined billings at Asher/Gal were estimated at more than $100 million by Mr. Gal and Bruce Dundore, 44, the partner and creative director at Asher who will hold those posts at Asher/Gal. Advertising Age estimated 1999 billings at Asher at $127.9 million and at Italia/Gal at $65 million. All clients of both agencies will be handled by Italia/Gal, Mr. Gal and Mr. Dundore said; they include, from Asher, the Enterprise Rent a Car Western division and PayMyBills.com and, from Italia/ Gal, Shakey's Pizza and Whole Foods Markets.</p>
        <p>One decision still to be made, Mr. Gal and Mr. Dundore said, is which floors of the building the merged agency will occupy.</p>
