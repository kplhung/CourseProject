        <p>MANHATTAN: CENTRAL PARK INDICTMENTS  A grand jury has indicted 15 men on charges of rioting in Central Park on June 11 after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, the district attorney's office announced yesterday. All but two of the men were also charged with sexually abusing women. The police have used videotapes of the attacks to find suspects, and prosecutors said that 27 people had been charged so far, with grand jury action pending in another 10 cases. Two other men have been charged with misdemeanors.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: RAT COMPLAINTS  Tenants from the city's public housing projects complained yesterday of a growing population of aggressive rats. ''Now they run after you,''  Monique Torres, a tenant, told the City Council at a  public hearing. ''They don't run away from you.'' Ms. Torres, who lives in the Baruch Houses on the Lower East Side, said she was attacked by a rat on June 29. Robert Podmore, an official with the New York City Housing Authority, said the city would try to reduce the trash that attracts rats by installing 74 more trash containers in 35 of the city's 44 housing projects over the next three years.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: MURDER CHARGES IN SMUGGLING  Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged two men yesterday with racketeering and murder in connection with three killings in 1994. The men, Lin Long Qun and Dong Qi Ming, were part of a group whose crimes also included the kidnapping of Chinese illegal aliens soon after their arrival in the United States, prosecutors said. The immigrants were abducted at Kennedy and Newark International Airports and held for ransom in apartments in New Jersey and Brooklyn, prosecutors said. The two men were also charged with murdering three men in a basement apartment in Jersey City on Aug. 19, 1994, as a way to raise their standing in the gang.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: MURDER TRIAL NEARS END  The defense completed closing arguments yesterday in the case of Edmund Ko, on trial in Manhattan Criminal Court for the murder of his former girlfriend in 1998. In the crowded courtroom, Jack Litman, Mr. Ko's lawyer, repeated themes from the trial: the lack of forensic evidence linking Mr. Ko to the crime and the possibility that others, including another former girlfriend, may have had a motive to kill Hyeseung Lynda Hong. Prosecutors are expected to complete closing arguments today.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: GIRL FINDS GUN AT SCHOOL  A 12-year-old girl recovered a loaded gun from the courtyard of a school yesterday, the police said. She told the police that she was outside Public School 309 on Monroe Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant about 4:30 p.m. when she saw two boys playing with the gun, a .38-caliber Ruger revolver, said Detective Edward Reuss, a police spokesman. The boys left the gun, with five rounds in it, on the ground, and the girl picked it up and took it to the 81st Precinct station house, Detective Reuss said. The girl will probably receive a commendation from the precinct's commanding officer, the police said. Andy Newman (NYT)</p>
        <p>GARDEN CITY: COLLEGE BUDGET CUT  Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County executive, has cut a proposed budget for Nassau Community College by $3.9 million, or nearly 3 percent. The proposed budget, submitted in June, totaled $135.7 million, which included increases in property taxes of about 12 percent and tuition by $50 per student. Late Friday, Mr. Gulotta approved a $131.8 million budget that raised tuition by $95 and removed the tax increase. The Legislature can make more changes, but under state law must adopt a budget by Aug. 31.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: HOME CARE SURVEY  Nearly one million New Yorkers provide unpaid care for an average of 20 hours a week to seriously ill parents, relatives or friends, a survey said. Fifty-eight percent reported administering prescription drugs, changing bandages or operating medical equipment, but had received no training from doctors or other professionals, according to the study, a joint project of the United Hospital Fund, the Visiting Nurse Services of New York and the Harvard School of Public Health.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: TRAFFIC PLEA BARGAINS  A court ruling that effectively eliminated plea bargains in municipal traffic cases, raising the prospect of a logjam in courts, was made moot yesterday by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. She signed into law a bill creating a category of offense called ''unsafe driving,'' a lesser charge than ''reckless and careless driving.'' The Administrative Office of the Courts had banned a type of plea bargaining in April that used a law that did not apply to most traffic offenses.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: TORRICELLI ENDORSEMENTS  Senator Robert G. Torricelli's bid for governor in 2001 received support yesterday, when he won the endorsement of the Democratic Party chairman in Morris County. He also won the endorsement of the party in Bergen, his home county. James E. McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge, had been considered the party's consensus candidate until Mr. Torricelli began expressing interest in the office this month, and the two are now battling for endorsements across the state.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: REACTOR CASE RULINGS  Environmental advocates contending that the Millstone Nuclear Power Generating Station in Waterford pollutes Long Island Sound were dealt a setback by the Connecticut Supreme Court yesterday. In two cases, the court ruled that the advocacy group Fish Unlimited and others had no legal standing to sue and had not exhausted the administrative complaint process before resorting to litigation. The two cases are appeals of lower court rulings in favor of Northeast Utilities Service, the plant operator. A third appeal is pending.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: EX-OFFICER SENTENCED  A federal judge sentenced a former Hartford police officer to four months' confinement for helping conceal the sexual assault of prostitutes by officers. Judge Peter Dorsey of Federal District Court suggested to federal prison authorities that the former officer, Michael Basile, serve his sentence in a Hartford halfway house. Under a plea bargain, prosecutors agreed to drop charges that the former officer had deprived women of their civil rights by forcing them to engage in sex acts under threat of arrest.</p>
