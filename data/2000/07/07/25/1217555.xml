        <p>Sometime after the first high ranches were built a few dozen miles east of Manhattan, and sometime before Hal Hartley turned his movie camera to the shiftless and aerosoled souls who lived inside them, Long Island underwent alterations in the popular imagination.

        <p>Sometime after the first high ranches were built a few dozen miles east of Manhattan, and sometime before Hal Hartley turned his movie camera to the shiftless and aerosoled souls who lived inside them, Long Island underwent alterations in the popular imagination. It was no longer the swell Givenchy-dressed party of Billy Wilder's ''Sabrina.'' It had become something else; it was New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The Americana, the soignee Manhasset shopping precinct, exists as a rebuke to those who see Long Island as a wasteland of teenage girls who cavort with married auto mechanics. Two small shops not far from it not only prove that a taste for the certifiably rarefied is flourishing, but also that a wish to shop in a manner that might almost be described as quaint is thriving.</p>
        <p>If the Americana is suburbia's Madison Avenue, Georgina, just west of the mall, and Janet Brown, a few miles away in Port Washington, form a sort of metaphoric Park Avenue. We are speaking here of the Park Avenue of Martha, the legendary shop where the locals came for their Pauline Trigere dresses and saleswomen always knew just what and where their clients would be  drinking when those dresses left the shop.</p>
        <p>When a woman buys something at Georgina -- a pair of Chloe pants,  maybe, or a Jean Paul Gaultier gown or a Narciso Rodriguez cocktail dress -- Christina Makowsky, the store's owner, will ask her to fill out a customer profile card. The card asks  which charities she supports and which country clubs she belongs to.</p>
        <p>Ms. Makowsky, a native of Lido Beach on Long Island and a perfectly manicured mother of five, owns three Georginas. She opened her first in Hewlett, on Long Island's South Shore, 20 years ago, after graduating from the Fashion Institute of Technology. Seven years ago she opened the Manhasset branch and this year another in East Hampton. The Manhasset shop, with its baroque gilded mirrors, chandeliers, moire dressing-room curtains and embroidered pillows that say things like ''Behind every successful woman is herself,'' is the highest grossing of the three, Ms. Makowsky said, with devoted clients spending $30,000 for a fall wardrobe.</p>
        <p>''I always try to insist that each of my clients buy at least one gown per season,'' Ms. Makowsky said. ''Stress is poor planning.'' Ms. Makowsky goes on buying trips to Europe three times a year and will often shop there specifically for a client's big occasion. She said a customer would never come in and see the dress Erica Gordon bought for her son's bar mitzvah ''because it'll never come on the floor.''</p>
        <p>The short drive to Janet Brown is an aesthetic leap to a place devoid of rock crystal and Randolph Dukes. For many years, Ms. Brown has devoted two-thirds of her shop, which resembles a beach-side fish shack, to Jil Sander. She is continuing to stock the clothes even though her friend Ms. Sander no longer designs them, but she has recently added clothes with a like-minded sensibility -- those from the former Prada designer Neil Barrett and the avant-garde Belgian designer Veronique Branquinho.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown, though, shares a sales philosophy with her Manhasset rival, Ms. Makowsky. ''Basically I'm buying for 300 customers,'' Ms. Brown said. ''I know if they need clothes for St. Bart's or the south of France.''</p>
        <p>One sunny afternoon last week, a young-looking Great Neck mother of three and regular at Ms. Brown's shop stopped in to do some fall shopping, having in fact returned from the south of France the day before. She had frosty blond hair and a figure that suggested she had not missed an exercise trend from step aerobics to Pilates.</p>
        <p>She asked her saleswoman, Randi Newman, whether she already had a pair of Jil Sander pants similar to the ones she was trying on. ''The ones you bought last year are straighter,'' Ms. Newman assured her.</p>
        <p>''It's easier to shop here than at Bergdorf's,'' said the woman, who asked not to named, saying her friends might tease her.</p>
        <p>''I don't shop, I buy,'' she said, explaining her inclination to shop not recreationally but with the intent to purchase. She tried on many things, including a monastic-looking Branquinho dress that she eventually rejected. ''I have to show off my body,'' she said.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Newman was through, the woman had purchased a Jil Sander coat, jacket and sweater, two pairs of Incotex pants, a pair of Prada shoes and the ultimate in hushed status symbols: a $695 Dianora Salviati scarf.</p>
        <p>The bill was $6,295, plus sales tax.</p>
