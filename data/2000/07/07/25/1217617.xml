        <p>In the main lobby of the George Bush Presidential Library, about 90 miles east of here, Richard B. Cheney has a prominent place in an enormous oil painting that is the first and pretty much only thing to catch a visitor's eye.</p>
        <p>It is a portrait of former President Bush in the Oval Office during perhaps the most critical juncture of his presidency, the Persian Gulf war, and Mr. Cheney, his defense secretary, is in a huddle of advisers helping to guide Mr. Bush through those geopolitical straits.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Cheney is back in the picture, back in the center of another Bush's political career and poised once again to provide his loyal assistance at a pivotal time. A senior Republican official said today that Gov. George W. Bush, the soon-to-be-crowned Republican presidential nominee, had chosen Mr. Cheney as his running mate and would probably announce his choice on Tuesday. [Page A21.]</p>
        <p>That development, prophesied for several days, showed that Mr. Cheney had become as important to the son as he was to the father. And to some degree, it undoubtedly reflected the high regard in which former President Bush had long held Mr. Cheney, a level of respect that was almost bound to be inherited by the Texas governor.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush has told reporters that he spoke repeatedly with his father as he pondered his choice of a running mate, and there were other hints that the former president maintained a watchful eye over the process, and maybe put a finger or two in it as well. On Friday, for example, President Bush called a cardiac surgeon in Houston who is a family friend to enlist his help in determining whether Mr. Cheney, who had suffered mild heart attacks more than a decade ago, was up to the rigors of a presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>And today, Chase Untermeyer, the director of presidential personnel during the Bush administration, recalled a conversation that occurred about a month ago in Kennebunkport, Me., between the former president and Brent Scowcroft, who served as his national security adviser.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Untermeyer, Mr. Scowcroft told Mr. Bush that he had talked to Mr. Cheney in the previous two weeks and that Mr. Cheney had decided he was interested in the vice presidency.</p>
        <p>''I remember President Bush making a powerful mental note of that,'' Mr. Untermeyer said in a telephone interview today. ''He expressed great interest and surprise.''</p>
        <p>Friends of the former president and advisers to the Bush campaign said they did not know if President Bush and Mr. Cheney had spoken directly over the past few weeks, and the precise nature and extent of the former president's involvement in his son's selection process is unclear.</p>
        <p>But President Bush apparently knew more than even some of the Texas governor's advisers did. A close friend of the Bush family said that for several days now, President Bush could not resist making friends and associates aware that he possessed the inside scoop on who his son's running mate would be.</p>
        <p>''He's been teasing us unmercifully,'' the friend said.</p>
        <p>But whatever President Bush's involvement, it was also clear that his son forged his own bond with Mr. Cheney long before the last few months, when Mr. Cheney supervised a vice-presidential selection process for the Texas governor that ended, oddly enough, with Mr. Cheney as the choice.</p>
        <p>Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz recalled an evening in early 1999 when he and Mr. Cheney, a chief executive with Halliburton, an energy company based in Dallas, were invited to the Texas governor's mansion here for dinner and an overnight stay. The governor was then pondering a presidential candidacy, and he wanted their advice.</p>
        <p>''We sat around for two to three hours in the evening, just talking about everything under the sun from foreign policy to domestic politics,'' Mr. Shultz said in a telephone interview today. ''Governor Bush was forever turning to Cheney, asking him what he thought.''</p>
        <p>''The governor likes him,'' Mr. Shultz said. ''He has his confidence and respect.''</p>
        <p>In choosing Mr. Cheney, Mr. Bush turned to someone whose history with the Bush family is a long, rich and active one. And that history, several people who know the governor said, gave the Texas governor the kind of comfort in Mr. Cheney that he almost insists on having in his closest political associates.</p>
        <p>But with Mr. Cheney's selection, Mr. Bush also summoned the shadow of his father, and was sure to rekindle debates in the coming days over just how firmly his political fortunes were tied to his patrimony. Additionally, Mr. Bush, who has used his status as a governor to style himself as a candidate who would bring an outsider's perspective to Washington, ultimately cast his lot with the ultimate insider, someone who spent more years inside the Beltway than perhaps anyone else on Mr. Bush's list of vice-presidential prospects.</p>
        <p>Nearly a quarter century ago, Mr. Cheney served as chief of staff for President Gerald R. Ford, and that was when he caught the eye of Mr. Bush's father, who was the director of Central Intelligence, according to the former president's friends. Mr. Cheney, who was in only his mid-30's then, was obviously a rising Republican star. Mr. Bush took ample note of that.</p>
        <p>''President Bush noticed that Cheney was a keeper,'' said one close friend. ''President Bush collects people. Smart people do that. Smart people collect people.''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Cheney was elected to Congress from Wyoming in 1978, he quickly became one of the leading Republican voices in the House, something Mr. Bush would surely have noticed. As vice president from 1981 to 1989, Mr. Bush played a role as President Ronald Reagan's liaison to Republicans in Congress.</p>
        <p>But it was not until Mr. Bush was elected president and picked Mr. Cheney to be his defense secretary that the two men truly became friends.</p>
        <p>''He wasn't really close to the dad until after the 1988 election, when he joined the Cabinet,'' said one of Mr. Cheney's associates. The associate said that Mr. Cheney, who always sat in the seat just to the left of Mr. Bush during Cabinet meetings, proved his loyalty and discretion, two qualities prized in the Bush family as much as any other.</p>
        <p>''When it came to who Bush senior could rely on for total discretion, there was Brent Scowcroft and Dick Cheney,'' the associate said.</p>
        <p>What finally sealed their bond, friends and associates said, was the Persian Gulf war. Mr. Bush's friends and associates said that he considered the challenge of managing that conflict to be a defining moment not just in his political career but in his life. The former president, in his recently published book of letters and diary entries, wrote about the solace he derived from Mr. Cheney.</p>
        <p>''The pressure is constant,'' Mr. Bush wrote in a diary entry on Feb. 20, 1991. But he added that ''oddly enough,'' with Cheney, among others, at his side, ''I still feel content.''</p>
        <p>Rich Bond, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who knows Mr. Bush well, said, ''They all went through the soul-searing experience of a war, and they got even closer.''</p>
        <p>Friends of the former president said that there were parameters to the relationship, given that Mr. Cheney was Mr. Bush's subordinate and so much younger. When the former president, now 76, held a 75th birthday party for his wife, Barbara, in Kennebunkport last month, Mr. Cheney, 59, was not among the nearly 200 people who were invited.</p>
        <p>But Jean Becker, the president's current chief of staff, nonetheless described them as ''close friends.'' She noted that in the winter, when Mr. Bush lives in Houston, he occasionally goes hunting with Mr. Cheney, who lives in Dallas. They took a hunting trip together this year, Ms. Becker said.</p>
        <p>Several prominent Republicans in Washington said that it would be easy to make too much of the relationship between Mr. Cheney and President Bush as a factor in the Texas governor's decision. They noted that because President Bush had such a long, varied and prominent political career, many of his son's prospective vice-presidential selections had ties to him.</p>
        <p>Former Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, for example, vigorously defended President Bush's nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. And Elizabeth Dole was President Bush's secretary of labor.</p>
        <p>Additionally, advisers to the Texas governor said that the younger Bush's path crossed with Mr. Cheney even after the end of the Bush administration in early 1993. The fact that Mr. Cheney had become a prominent businessman in Texas by the time Mr. Bush was elected governor in 1994 guaranteed that they would run into each other, these advisers said, and the two men did, in ways that apparently left an impression on Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''Bush talked about him over the years,'' one adviser said. ''He'd say, 'Cheney said this. Cheney said that.' It was clear they talked to each other.''</p>
        <p>And during the early stages of Mr. Bush's candidacy last year, the adviser said, Mr. Bush sometimes alluded to the fact that Mr. Cheney himself had considered running for president in 1996. ''He would say, 'This is how Cheney approached the issue in 1995,' '' the adviser recalled.</p>
        <p>Several advisers said that the emphatic lack of interest that Mr. Cheney initially stated about the No. 2 job, a resistance that apparently began to soften more quickly than was previously believed, probably only heightened the governor's interest in him as a running mate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush takes pride in what he sees as the charming, persuasive effect he can have on people who spend enough time around him, and Mr. Cheney may be proof of his prowess.</p>
