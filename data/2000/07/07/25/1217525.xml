        <p>Along the one-lane roads of America, you can sometimes spot a depository of the imagination. Giant insects sculptured from scrap metal, apocalyptic visions painted on fence slats, a flower bed in the shape of a heart: these things become folk art when documented, but in their own backyards they're magically animate.  This home-birthed art has its equivalents in rock, including a recent style influenced by Pavement, the band out of Stockton, Calif. Literary and homespun, dilapidated and grand, it allows outsider auteurs to present epics on a foundation of bent guitar chords. Grandaddy, Home and Bright Eyes, leading lights of this backyard school, played on Friday night at the Bowery Ballroom.</p>
        <p>Grandaddy blithely acknowledged its debt with a Pavement cover halfway through its set, but this band, from Modesto, Calif., benefited equally from other preoccupations. Jason Lytle, Grandaddy's mastermind, stood behind a bank of seemingly broken-down vintage keyboards with a guitar decorated with taped-on foliage around his neck. He looked like a mad scientist of the forest, making music in a dusky space where the organic meets the digital.</p>

        <p>Along the one-lane roads of America, you can sometimes spot a depository of the imagination. Giant insects sculptured from scrap metal, apocalyptic visions painted on fence slats, a flower bed in the shape of a heart: these things become folk art when documented, but in their own backyards they're magically animate.  This home-birthed art has its equivalents in rock, including a recent style influenced by Pavement, the band out of Stockton, Calif. Literary and homespun, dilapidated and grand, it allows outsider auteurs to present epics on a foundation of bent guitar chords. Grandaddy, Home and Bright Eyes, leading lights of this backyard school, played on Friday night at the Bowery Ballroom.</p>
        <p>Grandaddy blithely acknowledged its debt with a Pavement cover halfway through its set, but this band, from Modesto, Calif., benefited equally from other preoccupations. Jason Lytle, Grandaddy's mastermind, stood behind a bank of seemingly broken-down vintage keyboards with a guitar decorated with taped-on foliage around his neck. He looked like a mad scientist of the forest, making music in a dusky space where the organic meets the digital.</p>
        <p>Grandaddy's songs captured an android's dreams, the loneliness of a crashed astronaut and the regrets of a wanderer who has abandond his crystal lake for the city. Mr. Lytle's melancholy futurism and Grandaddy's watery guitar-and-synth sound invoke Radiohead, an English band that is becoming as influential as Pavement.</p>
        <p>But Grandaddy has a folksy, relaxed, American core. A lot goes on in the middle of its sound, in the unassuming interplay of Jim Fairchild's guitar and Aaron Burtch's drums. And there's subtle American humor too, reflected in the band's other cover version, ''You Are My Sunshine.''</p>
        <p>The laughs were easier to track in a set by Home, which formed in Tampa, Fla., in the early 1990's but now resides in New York. Despite its underground thrift store style, Home shares many attributes with today's more hippie-ish jam bands, including a wacky comic edge and a proficiency in roots rock. Andrew Deutsch's singing had the country sweetness of Gram Parsons and the band's style-hopping recalled the Grateful Dead. Doing the jam bands one better, though, Home avoided tedious solos in favor of well-focused interplay.</p>
        <p>Home is a self-described collective, an exception in a scene dominated by singer-songwriters experimenting with rock's noise. Conor Oberst, a 20-year-old Omaha native, is a Mozart in this world, a prolific recording artist since age 14. His group, Bright Eyes, has a shifting lineup, now including a flutist, another keyboardist and a drummer. Playing guitar and synthesizer, Mr. Oberst commanded all the attention on Friday; he has youthful intensity to spare. His songs, raw and graceful, captured the sound of something beautiful falling apart. Complex and immediate, they showed how much even the youngest artists can find in their own backyards.</p>
