        <p>Michael Stone, a Protestant guerrilla who killed three mourners in a Belfast cemetery during an Irish Republican Army funeral in 1988, left prison today, the first of 88 jailed fighters who will be freed this week in the last wave of early releases mandated by the Northern Ireland peace accord.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stone's one-man gun and grenade attack during the burial service of three I.R.A. members who had been shot dead by British soldiers in Gibraltar was captured on television and is one of the enduring images of the sectarian violence that has cost more than 3,600 lives in the last three decades.</p>
        <p>He served 12 years of six life sentences he had received for the three murders and three others that he was convicted of in 1989.</p>
        <p>The early releases of more than 400 men are meant to bring guerrillas who fought for and against British rule in line with the 1998 peace settlement that has created a power-sharing government in Belfast.</p>
        <p>The provision applies only to fighters from groups that have maintained cease-fires in recent years and whose crimes were committed before the signing of the pact. The releases can be revoked for any new criminal involvement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stone, 45, passed through a turnstile exit at the Maze prison near Lisburn in County Antrim this morning and was greeted by 50 cheering supporters carrying the gold and black flag of his Protestant paramilitary group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters.</p>
        <p>He looked grim and said nothing outside the jail, but later at a news conference at a Protestant prisoner rehabilitation center, he expressed his commitment to the peace accord that had brought him his freedom. He added, ''My war is over.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he was sorry for his activities, he said: ''I was a volunteer with the Ulster Defense Association involved in a 30-year war, and it was not of my doing. They were military operations. I was a volunteer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stone's release today touched a raw nerve with one victim's family.</p>
        <p>''I feel very bitter, because I think people look at him as a hero, and to me he's a devil,'' said Sally McErlean, whose son Thomas was one of three Catholics killed at the Milltown Cemetery.</p>
        <p>Among other prisoners being freed this week are Sean Kelly, an I.R.A. bomber responsible for the attack on a fish store on the Shankill Road, the main street of the Protestant part of Belfast, in October 1993 that killed nine civilians; James McArdle, who has served two years of a 25-year sentence for the bombing of London's financial center at Canary Wharf in February 1996 that killed two and wounded 40 others; and Michael Caraher, an I.R.A. sniper implicated in the 1998 killing of Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick, the last British soldier to die in the conflict, which is commonly called the troubles.</p>
        <p>The Maze prison held some 800 paramilitary fighters during the 1980's, but by next week only 16 will remain. By year's end, officials hope to close down the building, a collection of H blocks that were segregated by religion and often commandeered by the prisoners themselves.</p>
        <p>The dispute in Northern Ireland is a territorial and tribal one rather than a purely religious one, but those people who want to see Ulster united with Ireland, called republicans and nationalists, are largely Catholic, while those who want to keep the province British, called loyalists and unionists, are almost all Protestant.</p>
        <p>Northern Ireland was in the grip of systematic violence in 1988, and the cemetery attack led to two more deaths days later when a pair of British soldiers drove into the funeral cortege of Mr. Stone's victims and were dragged from their car, beaten and taken to a waste dump, where they were shot dead as they pleaded for their lives.</p>
        <p>In a chilling reference to changing times in Ulster, Mr. Stone, a father of nine, noted that Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein, the political party representing the I.R.A., was now the Education Minister in the new Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
        <p>''He is in charge of my grandchildren, which is ironic,'' Mr. Stone said. ''I tried to assassinate him as he took his own daughter to primary school, but I didn't, because his daughter was holding his hand.''</p>
