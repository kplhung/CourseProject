        <p>In his 1965 book, ''The Great Comic Book Heroes,'' which features the best essay ever written on the subject, the cartoonist Jules Feiffer described comics as ''movies on paper.'' Both art forms exploit action and express character through movement. These peculiarly American forms of juvenilia have probably forever changed the fantasy lives of children, giving them the superpowers to defeat the monsters in their dreams.</p>
        <p>In the preface to ''Justice League of America,'' a collection of comic-book stories, Salman Rushdie reflects on how inspirational he finds the adventures of these heroes. The touchingly faithful movie adaptation of ''The X-Men,'' which leapt to a $54 million gross on its opening weekend, proves that there's an appetite and an audience for comic-hero movies. And its $23 million second weekend ensured that more are to come; in the film business, nothing succeeds like excess. The problem is that moviemakers take comics too seriously, or not seriously enough.</p>
        <p>The pleasures that comics and movies provide are so similar that it's criminal that so few films have managed to find the right balance in adapting comic book superheroes to the big screen.</p>
        <p>Though many movies have been inspired by comics in subtle ways, some of the best action movies haven't been based on comics. ''The Matrix,'' of course, is the finest example. It ingeniously steals from so many sources -- Homer and the Bible, to name just two -- that one couldn't find a docket big enough if charges were preferred.</p>
        <p>The film's writers and directors, the brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski, used the pictorial vitality of comic books as the movie's foundation. The action is orgiastic, as it often is in comics, an energy that can't be contained. (The comic-book artist Geof Darrow worked on ''Matrix'' 's'' visual scheme, and the Wachowskis themselves have written comics.)</p>
        <p>Kevin Smith has unabashedly  shown his love for comics in his films; he even made the Marvel Comics mainstay Stan Lee the onscreen voice of wisdom in ''Mallrats,'' a reason to forgive the movie. Smith's ''Dogma,'' which ponders the vagaries of faith within a ragtag group at various stages of belief, is a tribute to Matt Wagner's comic ''Mage,'' which touches on the same issues but with comic-book dynamism.</p>
        <p>''Mage'' is the Arthurian legend updated, in which Excalibur is a baseball bat in contemporary Philadelphia. It is such a well-told story that it is a natural for the movies, one that avoids the dicey problem of costumes because none of the ''Mage'' characters suit up for action in tights. Probably the reason ''Mage'' remains unsullied by movie-industry hands is that Wagner isn't stupid; he's seen the crummy treatment that film adaptations of comics have received and has elected to save himself the humiliation.</p>
        <p>Moviemakers look down on comics, fixating on their traditional appeal to children instead of on the way the medium has matured in the last 30 years. This sophistication has largely come from Marvel Comics (birthplace of ''The X-Men'') and its creative powerhouses, Mr. Lee and the artist-writer Jack Kirby. In the 1960's, they came up with a black superhero -- the Black Panther, who was an African prince and a totemic representation of his mythical country -- years before Hollywood took its black audience seriously.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee, who received the writing credits for most of the Marvel superhero titles (the extent of his authorship has since been called into question) got the connection between movies and comic books years ago. During the 60's, he cunningly dropped the names of the directors Alain Resnais and Federico Fellini into Stan Lee's Soapbox, his pop-pop-pop self-promoting column that appeared in the back of every Marvel comic. Mr. Lee wrote that these film artists made a point of visiting Marvel's offices when they were in New York to express their affection for what Marvel -- and Mr. Lee -- were doing for the medium.</p>
        <p>The directors became as familiar to readers of ''The Uncanny X-Men'' or ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' or ''The Incredible Hulk'' or any of the other adjective-ridden Marvel superheroes as Marcello Mastroianni was to Fellini aficionados.</p>
        <p>In responding to the often vapid print adventures of his competitors,  Mr. Lee was incredibly canny in the way he shaped comic-book heroes and subverted the idiom. In the days when most comic-book heroes had a sidekick or ward to function as a reader surrogate -- apparently, adoption agencies in the Gotham City area were quite lenient about allowing wealthy playboy bachelors to adopt little boys -- Mr. Lee recognized that young readers didn't want to stand next to the superheroes. They wanted to be the superheroes.</p>
        <p>By exploiting this wish, Mr. Lee forged a strong rapport with his readers; imagine that the teenage protagonists in John Hughes movies had superpowers.</p>
        <p>None of the Marvel heroes could catch a break, and the grandiosity of their pain had a peppery bite. You can see why Fellini would go for these stories, with their blend of fairy-tale derring-do and proscenium-arch soap opera. Resnais, with his silvered formality, got a kick out of the volatility of the art: battles royal that sprawled all over the page and captured readers with their surreal sensationalism.</p>
        <p>Because of Mr. Lee, loyal Marvel fans like me, kids for the most part, were exposed to film directors who accomplished, in their way, what Marvel had managed for comics: they changed the parameters of what was often considered a throwaway medium.</p>
        <p>In the years since Fellini and Resnais reached out to Lee to express their admiration, movie adaptations of comic book heroes have practiced  a reverse alchemy. The evidence is that dusty aisle in your local Blockbuster, with forgotten videos like ''Swamp Thing,'' ''Spawn'' and ''Captain America.''</p>
        <p>For every ''Blade,'' which was very smart about the parts of the comic book worth preserving and the ones that needed to be thrown out, or ''Men in Black,'' which took a little-known comic book as a point of departure, there was a ''Spawn,'' which was overblown and inert. Or a ''Batman Forever'' and a ''Batman and Robin,'' which seemed determined to return Batman to the triviality to which the campy 60's television series had consigned him.</p>
        <p>You can work comics fans into a sweat on the coldest day of the year by bringing up that incarnation of Batman. It's the series in which Adam West slipped into a pair of tights that did nothing for his figure, used that stop-and-start cadence that was often the province of 60's television stars (did he and William Shatner take the same correspondence course?) and engaged in playground versions of fistfights with actors who were as out of shape as he was. Cesar Romero, as the Joker, had so much contempt for his character that he didn't even bother to shave his upper lip. With all that white makeup covering his mustache, he looked like the inventor of the''Got Milk?'' advertising campaign.</p>
        <p>But the Dark Knight was an object of ridicule long before that 60's series, with its Pop Art ''Pow!'' and ''Biff!'' In ''The Great Comic Book Heroes,'' Feiffer dismissed him by noting, ''Batman had to take off his rich idler's street clothes, put on his Batshirt, his Batshorts, his Battights, his Batboots; buckle on his Batbelt full of secret potions and chemical explosives; tie on his Batcape; slip on his Batmask; climb into his Batmobile and go fight the Joker who in one punch (defensively described by the author as maniacal), would knock him silly.''</p>
        <p>It took the 1989 ''Batman'' movie by the director Tim Burton to wash the bad taste out of the mouths of fans and prove that anyone with an understanding of comics and film could get a comics movie right.</p>
        <p>Michael Keaton, whose casting sent fans scurrying to write letters of disapproval (they seemed incapable of grasping the concept of acting range) gave an intense, subtle performance of the type rarely seen in big-budget action spectaculars. His Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, was almost swallowed whole by anguish. Burton's gift for art direction  -- his animation background gave him the visual instincts of a comic-book artist -- soothed the pain for comics cognoscenti and gave Batman entry into the mainstream.</p>
        <p>Although ''Batman'' was still deeply flawed -- its longueurs may show too much of a Resnais influence -- it got all the surface details right; Batman's devices seemed to have come from an Eastern European Sony store. Mr. Keaton's heat gave the film's midnight-blue coldness a volcanic center, and the movie's box-office assault sent producers into comics stores looking for more champions of Truth, Justice and the American Way.</p>
        <p>If Batman could be salvaged in the movies, as Superman was years before, then anything was possible.</p>
        <p>What makes comic-book superheroes ideal material for commercial movies may be the unbridled optimism of most of the classic characters. The sunny disposition of Superman and Christopher Reeves's adroit comedic performance in the movies epitomize why comic books and movies are often called particularly American. When they work, they belong together.</p>
        <p>The troubled lives of comic-book characters that Mr. Lee opened up drifted into nihilism, which is now an intrinsic part of comics. That grimness is best depicted by British writers, and a couple of their dank British characters -- Judge Dredd and Tank Girl -- surfaced in motion-picture adaptations and sank quickly. They were crushed by the films' obviousness: the producers thought that audiences would understand the movies only if the characters were oversimplified. That's the problem in  making a movie about characters who aren't as well-known as Superman or Batman. It's thought that the characters have to be explained, instead of just letting them define themselves through their actions.</p>
        <p>Alan Moore, who is the most dazzlingly gifted writer in this subculture, created the comics title ''The Watchmen,'' an apocalyptic turn on superheroes that attracted directors like Terry Gilliam. Budget considerations brought the project down; apparently it would have cost almost as much to end the world on a movie set as it would in real life. Another Moore concept that would have been much cheaper to realize on screen, and is far more interesting, is ''Miracleman.'' Essentially, it is Superman as a horror story. And Moore even had the good sense to ridicule the Miracleman's flamboyant costume.</p>
        <p>The ''X-Men'' comics, too, eventually veered toward gloom -- and this aspect is the least interesting one of the ''X-Men'' movie -- though most of the heartstring plucking was closer to ''Days of Our Lives'' than ''Triumph of the Will.'' Still, the ''X-Men'' movie works harder than any other comics-hero film to lay out the filigree that comics fans love. There has never been as much material lifted straight from the comics and put in a picture as in that movie, and fans are delirious because of it.</p>
        <p>The success of ''X-Men'' in movie theaters will pave the way for another wave of superhero films. Other Marvel characters, whose cheeks are tear-stained beneath their masks, will soon make their way into theaters. A second ''Blade,'' to be directed by Guillermo del Toro (''Kronos'') is being readied by the writer David Goyer, who also wrote the script for the first movie. And, finally, after years of flirtation with filmmakers like James Cameron and a rights-ownership battle  straight out of ''The Producers'' --  hundreds of people seemed to own 50 percent of the property -- ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' is not far from production.</p>
        <p>Spidey was Marvel's most popular character before the X-Men eclipsed him, and still defines the medium for most readers. There's even talk of defibrillating the moribund Batman franchise for the movies, with Darren Aronofsky (''pi'' and the forthcoming ''Requiem for a Dream'') behind the camera.</p>
        <p>In the Spider-Man comics, when the hero approaches a crisis point -- which is more often than the A train does -- he has to remind himself that with great power comes great responsibility. These might be watchwords for the film industry with an eye on comics as well, minding the slippery slope between inspiration and slavish devotion.</p>
