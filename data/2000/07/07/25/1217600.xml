        <p>The telecommunications equipment giant Nortel Networks is discussing a complex transaction to sell its fiber optics components business to Corning Inc., the leading supplier of glass fiber, according to people close to the negotiations. But some analysts and industry executives say the plan is so cumbersome, and expensive, that the deal may never get past the talking stage.</p>
        <p>Under the terms being discussed, Corning would acquire Nortel Networks' fiber optics unit through a ''reverse merger'' that could effectively make Nortel Networks the parent of Corning. The deal would value the Nortel fiber optic unit, which is expected to have revenue of $2.5 billion, at more than $100 billion. That is more than Corning's total stock market value and would make Nortel Networks a majority shareholder of Corning.</p>
        <p>Neither company would comment. But executives close to the talks said that both companies were seeking a corporate governance structure that would allow Corning to operate independently of Nortel. In fact, according to the executives, the deal would be contingent on that assurance.</p>
        <p>Each company is trying in its own way to respond to the consolidation in the fiber optics components field. JDS Uniphase has emerged as the leader in that field through acquisitions that include a deal two weeks ago to acquire SDL for $41 billion.</p>
        <p>In a further sign that the Corning talks may be only tentative, Nortel announced yesterday that it planned to invest $1.9 billion to more than double its fiber optics components manufacturing capacity in Australia, Britain, Canada and the United States</p>
        <p>If it did complete a deal with Corning, Nortel would be trying to capitalize on the increasing value of fiber optics components, while enabling itself to concentrate on designing and building networks using its own multimillion-dollar switching equipment. Corning would be trying to expand its fiber components line to remain competitive with JDS Uniphase.</p>
        <p>But the risk to Corning and to Nortel, which competes head to head with the larger Lucent Technologies, would be for the rest of the industry to perceive the two companies as so closely in league that their rivals might be reluctant to do business with either.</p>
        <p>''At that point, customers might be loath to buy from a company owned by the major competitor,'' warned Lawrence M. Harris, an analyst who follows Corning for Josephthal &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Corning's shares which had nearly doubled in the last year, tumbled on news of the talks with Nortel, first reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. The stock fell 12 percent, closing at $250, down $33.25 a share.</p>
        <p>Nortel's stock barely budged, closing up 75 cents, to end at $82 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>While it remains unclear whether the two companies can reach a deal, and the people close to the negotiations stressed that the talks could be abandoned at any point, the discussions underscore the increasing pressure on manufacturers of fiber optic products to consolidate as the components end of the business becomes increasingly one of largely undifferentiated commodities -- although these commodities are in high demand as the world's hunger for high-speed communications networks seems insatiable.</p>
        <p>Even if the talks with Nortel fall through, Corning is unlikely to give up its dream of becoming an end-to-end optical components supplier.</p>
        <p>Indeed, speculation has been rife on Wall Street that Corning might be seeking a deal with Lucent, or with one of two European companies, Perelli and Alcatel. All three have operations that could help fill out Corning's product portfolio. But few analysts expect Lucent to sell its components business and Perelli has already sold a 10 percent stake to Cisco Systems, a data network equipment company that increasingly competes with Lucent and Nortel. Alcatel, meanwhile, has been talking about spinning off its fiber optics business as a tracking stock.</p>
        <p>Currently, capacity is so constrained throughout the optical network industry that customers are forced to buy amplifiers and lasers and other components wherever they can find them. But most producers are ramping up capacity, to the point where many analysts assume that, three or so years down the road, supply may exceed demand. At that point, the components makers in a position to survive would be those with a full of line of wares they can produce and sell in large volumes.</p>
        <p>Corning, once known primarily for housewares, bailed out of that business entirely three years ago, to focus on high-technology businesses like photonics -- the lasers, amplifiers and filters that blast signals down the fiber optic pipelines of modern telecommunications.</p>
        <p>Its entree may have been glass fibers, but Corning has been on a buying spree, spending more than $6 billion on acquisitions in the last year, as the company has become the leading supplier of optical amplifiers, cables and fibers. It recently announced a joint venture with Samsung, called Samsung Corning Microptics, that will work on automating the manufacture of so-called dense wavelength division multiplexing devices, which split signals into different wavelengths, or colors, of light and thus enable fibers to carry far more data. And earlier this year it bought out Siemens's 50 percent stake in Siecor, Corning's longtime joint-venture fiber cable company, and acquired the rest of the Siemens fiber operations.</p>
        <p>A year ago, Corning had 17,000 employees. Today, it has 33,000. Most came with the acquisitions, but Corning has been on a hiring spree as well, bringing in as many new research scientists as it can find. Analysts said that Corning has doubled its research and development budget over the last five years. This year Corning expects to hit $7 billion in revenues, with 70 percent coming from communications products. But most of its products are so-called passive products, items that manipulate and route the signal after it has been generated. What the Nortel deal would provide is entree into the active part of the process -- the lasers, receivers and modulators used to actually generate the laser signals.</p>
        <p>''Those three items are the big hole keeping Corning from having an end-to-end product portfolio, and there's no small independent player that Corning could buy that would provide them with all three,'' said Hasan Imam, who follows Corning for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.</p>
        <p>In some ways Nortel and Corning are already joined at the hip. Nortel is Corning's largest buyer of optical amplifiers, the devices that keep signals strong as they travel long distances. And it is Corning's largest independent supplier of pump lasers -- a main component of the amplifiers it sells back to Nortel.</p>
        <p>After Nortel, Corning's main outside supplier for pump lasers is SDL. In fact, Corning tried to buy that company, but was trumped when JDS Uniphase, Corning's main competitor, made its $41 billion offer.</p>
        <p>THE MARKETS  Correction:  July 27, 2000, Thursday  An article in Business Day on Tuesday about talks on the potential sale of Nortel Networks' fiber optics components business to Corning misspelled the name of a European company that Wall Street has speculated might make a deal with Corning. It is Pirelli, not Perelli.</p>
