        <p>Leery of trading their best prospect to get Rondell White from the Montreal Expos, the Yankees are negotiating to make a deal for B. J. Surhoff, Baltimore's veteran left fielder.</p>

        <p>Leery of trading their best prospect to get Rondell White from the Montreal Expos, the Yankees are negotiating to make a deal for B. J. Surhoff, Baltimore's veteran left fielder.</p>
        <p>Executives from the teams exchanged a handful of possible trade combinations this afternoon. The Yankees offered David Walling, a Class AA right-hander who was their first-round draft pick last year, as well as a second prospect, to be picked from a list of three: the Class AA shortstop Erick Almonte, the Class AAA pitcher Ryan Bradley and the Class AA pitcher Brian Rogers.</p>
        <p>Surhoff, 35, is batting .291 for the Orioles, with 12 homers and 56 runs batted in. He is considered by scouts to be a solid if unspectacular outfielder, not blessed with extraordinary range or throwing ability but sure-handed and usually in the right place at the right time.</p>
        <p>He is widely respected for his intensity; his on-field demeanor is similar to that of Paul O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder. Surhoff is essentially a contact hitter, with 44 strikeouts in 388 at-bats, with 29 walks.</p>
        <p>Surhoff is making $3 million this year and will make $3.5 million next year. He has a vesting option for the 2002 season for $4.5 million that he should easily qualify for, meaning that if the Yankees make a deal for him, they know he may be with them for another two years. Surhoff's contract contains a limited no-trade clause, but the Yankees are not among the teams Surhoff can block. The Mets are among those teams, perhaps the result of a frustrating end to negotiations between Surhoff and the Mets after the 1998 season, when the Mets were negotiating with Surhoff and Robin Ventura at the same time and signed Ventura.</p>
        <p>The Orioles have been trying to trade Surhoff for months, but their preference has been to keep him close to his Maryland home, where one of his children is enrolled in a special-needs program.</p>
        <p>The Orioles have been trying to trade Surhoff for months, but their preference has been to keep him close to his Maryland home, where one of his children is enrolled in a special-needs program.</p>
        <p>The addition of Surhoff would give the Yankees four left-handed hitters and two switch-hitters from positions No. 3 to No. 8 in the lineup, a situation other teams would try to exploit. But few contenders actually have quality left-handers: Boston has reliever Rheal Cormier, Seattle has Jamie Moyer and John Halama, the Chicago White Sox field Jim Parque and Mike Sirotka, the Toronto Blue Jays have David Wells. The majority of pitchers the Yankees will face are right-handed.</p>
        <p>When the Chicago Cubs were asking for several prospects for Sammy Sosa last month while the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, pushed for a big trade, club executives desperately searched for a less expensive alternative that nonetheless could have some impact on the team. They found David Justice, swapping three young players instead of the five for Sosa.</p>
        <p>Yankees executives seem to be working in a similar circumstance now. The Expos are ready to deal White, who has repeatedly been on the disabled list, and have asked the Yankees for Alfonso Soriano, the most developed prospect in the organization. The Red Sox are believed to be involved, as well, perhaps offering third baseman Wilton Veras and another prospect.</p>
        <p>Again, Steinbrenner is pushing for action, wanting to address the left-field vacancy that was created when Shane Spencer blew out his knee July 9.</p>
        <p>If the Yankees can complete the negotiations for Surhoff -- and the chances of that have improved because the Orioles appear to have backed off their longstanding demand for Soriano -- then Surhoff, like Justice, would represent a less-expensive compromise.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have other options for left field, such as trading for Philadelphia's Ron Gant, Pittsburgh's Wil Cordero and John Vander Wal, or making a deal for Texas' David Segui. But those are all imperfect fits, because they are all poor defensive outfielders; trading for Cordero, for instance, would require Justice to play left field more than the Yankees want, with Cordero serving as designated hitter.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Yankees' contract talks for DENNY NEAGLE have begun, according to the pitcher, and he indicated that the framework of the deal has essentially been settled: a four-year contract, with some sort of vesting option for a fifth year. Speaking of what his salary might be, Neagle mentioned two other recently completed contracts, those of Cleveland's CHUCK FINLEY and Minnesota's BRAD RADKE -- who are both getting $9 million a season. Neagle, who can file for free agency after this season, said he was hopeful a deal would be completed, but then the Yankees would never have traded for him if they believed Neagle was heading elsewhere for the 2001 season. . . . The Cleveland Indians will announce on Tuesday that they are taking JAKE WESTBROOK and ZACH DAY, minor league pitchers in the Yankee system, to complete the trade for DAVID JUSTICE.</p>
