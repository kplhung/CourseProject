        <p>Late Saturday night a D.J.'s sharp beats crackled upward into the sepulchral corners of the Anchorage, the performance space within the Brooklyn Bridge. They summoned forth the ghosts of graffiti artists who had tagged countless walls like  these, beautifying urban decay with marks that some people call pollution.</p>
        <p>This space, the kind so tempting to outlaw calligraphists, was a serendipitous location for the summer celebration of hip-hop organized by the public arts organization Creative Times. The music is at a historical crux, rendered official in new histories and a major museum exhibition (coming to Brooklyn in September) yet still condemned by cultural monitors for its content.</p>

        <p>Late Saturday night a D.J.'s sharp beats crackled upward into the sepulchral corners of the Anchorage, the performance space within the Brooklyn Bridge. They summoned forth the ghosts of graffiti artists who had tagged countless walls like  these, beautifying urban decay with marks that some people call pollution.</p>
        <p>This space, the kind so tempting to outlaw calligraphists, was a serendipitous location for the summer celebration of hip-hop organized by the public arts organization Creative Times. The music is at a historical crux, rendered official in new histories and a major museum exhibition (coming to Brooklyn in September) yet still condemned by cultural monitors for its content.</p>
        <p>The Anchorage, a fugitive's hideaway turned into a cultural institution, represented this paradoxical position. The space wasn't quite as appropriate on a literal level. Many Anchorage programs feature instrumental or electronic music, which expands to fill the echoing chambers. Lyricist Lounge, the M.C.crew that helped organize the night, focuses on language. Saturday's crowd squeezed near the stage to hear rappers' words as they got lost in the atmosphere. The program's ambience was better grasped than rhyming highlights.</p>
        <p>The first three hours progressed, in part, in accordance with a notebook that the hosts passed among rappers. Each took the stage briefly to demonstrate his best flow. Interspersed between these cameos were sets by Lyricist Lounge favorites. Jet Black Express featured a promising female M.C. Master Fuol got laughs with his frenetic style. Brainiac Dum Dums overflowed the stage with members and offered a pleasantly hard sound.</p>
        <p>A few unnamed rappers caused a commotion. One aspirant was paired in a battle with an audience member who easily bested him, but he refused to stop and had to be pulled from the stage. Other passing M.C.'s showed grit and tunefulness. All were backed by Swiss Chris and Band, a hip-hop chamber group led by a jumpy drummer.</p>
        <p>The night did have official stars: the duo Dead Prez. This team of radical activists turned rhymers is bringing hip-hop's radical edge forward by mixing its revolutionary messages with a post-Public Enemy sound that hints at gangsta rap and dance hall. Stic Man and M-3 did not shy away from messages of violent revolt (especially against the police) but laced their Black Pantherisms with spirited chants and positive messages about health and education.</p>
        <p>The moody polemics of Dead Prez would have made a fine end to the night, but, befitting hip-hop, it ended more like a house party. The latecomers Rock and Ruck of the Brooklyn crew Heltah Skeltah bounded onstage and led some silly, robust choruses. The rappers and their compadres jumped around, words flying toward the ceiling, politics and art subsumed within the old school good-time mood.</p>
