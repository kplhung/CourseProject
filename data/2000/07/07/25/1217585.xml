        <p>The ABC Sports broadcast of the British Open provided ample evidence that it devotedly followed the hitherto secret ''Official Network Guide to Covering Golf When Tiger Woods Leads the Tournament.''</p>
        <p>RULE 1 -- Don't worry about fairness. Being unfair means showing him as frequently as possible, and that's why we're in this business, isn't it?

        <p>The ABC Sports broadcast of the British Open provided ample evidence that it devotedly followed the hitherto secret ''Official Network Guide to Covering Golf When Tiger Woods Leads the Tournament.''</p>
        <p>RULE 1 -- Don't worry about fairness. Being unfair means showing him as frequently as possible, and that's why we're in this business, isn't it? During his final round on Sunday, ABC cut to Woods 247 times, totaling 69 minutes 19 seconds of Tiger face time. It would have been more, but ABC wasted time enduring the four shots David Duval needed to depart a pot bunker at No. 17.</p>
        <p>RULE 2 -- It is not impolite to talk about the strategy for another golfer while the camera stays on Tiger. On the 10th hole, while ABC's Judy Rankin and Steve Melnyk analyzed the coming second shot for Duval, the camera remained on Woods for 43 seconds as he sipped water and walked. Perfect execution.</p>
        <p>RULE 3 -- You can dump any golfer, no matter what he's doing, to go to Tiger. Thomas Bjorn was just starting his backswing -- in an attempt to blast out of a pot bunker -- when ABC cut to Woods marking his ball on the fourth green. Woods then talked to his caddie, ambled about and watched Duval walk. We never learned what became of Bjorn.</p>
        <p>RULE 4 -- If Tiger's partner is putting -- or clipping his fingernails -- include Tiger in the shot. Four times, BBC cameras used by ABC zoomed out to keep Tiger in the frame with Duval even though Tiger was walking away and it was Duval's turn to putt.</p>
        <p>RULE 5 -- Avoid showing any other golfer walking. Oh, Duval occasionally slinked into the shot if it was wide enough. But invariably, ABC closed in on Tiger as he walked heroically from green to tee and tee to fairway. When Tiger birdied No. 10 to extend his lead to four strokes, ABC followed Woods solo for 25 seconds.</p>
        <p>ABC/BBC brilliantly followed this rule on the 18th, when a nearly crazed mob almost overran the fairway, interrupting Woods's march to the green. It was a dangerous scene. But for a stretch of 1:53, ABC showed Tiger patiently making his way. For one brief moment, Duval appeared in the corner of the screen. After that, he could have been buried up to his goatee in a pot bunker. Duval was next seen, thankfully healthy, from a high shot taken from the Mir space station.</p>
        <p>RULE 6 -- Anything Tiger does is of paramount importance. On the 13th, Duval was lining up his putt. For 19 seconds, ABC believed his protracted analysis of the green was of secondary importance to Woods's reading his yardage chart. Excellent.</p>
        <p>RULE 7 -- Cut to other golfers, risk your job. A heretic brazenly felt that a birdie attempt by Ernie Els on the 10th hole superseded the importance of a a short Tiger putt on No. 7.</p>
        <p>RULE 8 -- Do not pre-empt Tiger shots for updates. Don't worry that Duval's tee shot on the 13th (into a bunker) was shown on tape when ABC reported on Lance Armstrong's victory in the Tour de France. Be fortunate that a Tiger shot was not sacrificed to an update.</p>
        <p>ABC's dedication to the Tiger rules contributed to Sunday's 7.5 overnight Nielsen rating, up 32 percent from last year's final round. When the national rating is calculated, the British Open this year will rank as the highest rated since 1972 and will most likely have been seen by more households than have ever watched.</p>
        <p>When Woods won the United States Open last month, the final round rated an 8.8, owing in part to the late afternoon broadcast. The British Open on Sunday started at 9:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>Of course, NBC showed 93 minutes of Tiger face time over a similar four-hour time period, which could have tipped the balance.</p>
        <p>Summerall Not Really Retiring</p>
        <p>Contrary to reports and a news release by Fox Sports, Pat Summerall is not retiring from Fox's National Football League broadcast booth in two seasons. Yesterday, Summerall and Fox said he has signed a one-year extension through the 2001 season, which will let him call the 2002 Super Bowl in his 50th year in pro football.</p>
        <p>''This doesn't mean it's a retirement,'' said David Hill, chairman of the Fox Sports Television Group, rebutting a Fox news release that had said Summerall's ''remarkable and legendary N.F.L. broadcasting career'' would end in 2002.</p>
        <p>So what is it? It will be up to Summerall to stay in the booth with John Madden past 2002, take another job at Fox or retire. By conference call Summerall said: ''More than anything, 50 years meant a lot to me. If I don't have any health problems and I feel as good as I feel now and I'm as enthusiastic as I am now, I may continue.''</p>
        <p>In March, Summerall had his left knee replaced, ending years of pain. ''It didn't affect my thinking, but things weren't getting better, they were getting worse,'' he said. ''That's a distraction.''</p>
        <p>Hype Equals Ratings</p>
        <p>Sunday's much-anticipated 200-meter showdown between Maurice Greene and Michael Johnson at the United States Olympic track and field trials fizzled when both runners pulled hamstrings. But the hype yielded a strong 7.8 rating from 8:30 to 9 p.m., its final half-hour, up from a 6.4 for the previous half-hour.</p>
