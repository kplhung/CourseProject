        <p>A driver for a company involved in a strike by the Teamsters for the last nine months has come forward to say that officials of the company,  Overnite Transportation, paid him $10,000 to damage property and falsely accuse Teamster supporters of wrongdoing so they would be fired.</p>
        <p>In the course of the strike, the company has repeatedly accused union members of shooting at company trucks and smashing truck windows and has said it is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a week on security.</p>

        <p>A driver for a company involved in a strike by the Teamsters for the last nine months has come forward to say that officials of the company,  Overnite Transportation, paid him $10,000 to damage property and falsely accuse Teamster supporters of wrongdoing so they would be fired.</p>
        <p>In the course of the strike, the company has repeatedly accused union members of shooting at company trucks and smashing truck windows and has said it is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a week on security.</p>
        <p>Anthony Holly, a driver based in Tennessee who has worked for Overnite for three and a half years, said in an affidavit presented to federal officials that the company's managers, upon hearing of his financial problems, wired $10,000 to his bank account in return for his agreeing to certain misdeeds.</p>
        <p>The company denies Mr. Holly's accusations.</p>
        <p>''They wanted me to break windows; they wanted me to do other things,'' Mr. Holly said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holly insisted that he did not break windows although he said he gave company officials the impression that he had. Mr. Holly said he had lied to company officials and the National Labor Relations Board about the actions of two outspoken Teamster supporters, saying they threatened him with violence for crossing the picket line. Overnite fired those two drivers, Kyle Brooks and Paul Holder.</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Holly said he regretted having falsely accused the two men of threatening him.</p>
        <p>''I'm ashamed for doing what I've done,'' he said. ''Overnite had me brainwashed. I thought the Teamsters were crooked Mafia and gangsters. As I got to know them, I saw it's not true.''</p>
        <p>Ira Rosenfeld, an Overnite spokesman, denied that the company, based in Richmond, Va., paid any workers to commit violence or perjury.</p>
        <p>''Overnite has never given anybody any money to destroy company property,'' Mr. Rosenfeld said. ''We have never asked one of our employees to damage Overnite's property. It is a lie if anybody says anything different.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenfeld acknowledged that the company wired Mr. Holly $10,000, but he said that was a loan, not a gift. In his affidavit, Mr. Holly said the money was a payment, not a loan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenfeld said the company occasionally lent money to its workers, explaining that Mr. Holly received a loan because he was in a financial bind.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holly said he agreed to lie and engage in violence because he was worried he might be fired if he refused. He said he also feared that his father, who had worked for Overnite for 25 years, might lose his pension.</p>
        <p>In his affidavit, Mr. Holly indicated that there were other favored Overnite workers, considered company men, who received payments to damage trucks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenfeld said Mr. Holly should not be believed, noting that he admitted lying previously to the National Labor Relations Board. Mr. Rosenfeld also noted that the Teamsters were paying Mr. Holly's legal bills and had found him a new job and given him child support payments.</p>
        <p>Teamster officials said union members voluntarily collected $1,200 to help with the child support.</p>
        <p>The Teamsters and Overnite, one of the nation's largest nonunion trucking companies, have been locked in one of the nation's bitterest labor battles. As one of his chief goals, James P. Hoffa, the union's president, has vowed to unionize Overnite 8,200's drivers and dockworkers.</p>
        <p>In the public relations war between union and company, the Teamsters have sought to show that the company was responsible for much of the violence that the union is accused of. Teamster officials made available to The New York Times a copy of Mr. Holly's affidavit and a copy of bank records showing a $10,000 deposit into his account on Oct. 28, four days after the strike started.</p>
        <p>The Teamsters have given the labor relations board information about Overnite's payments to Mr. Holly as well as other evidence the union says demonstrates that Overnite had antiunion workers engage in violence to embarrass the union. The board has forwarded that information to the United States attorney in Memphis, union officials said.</p>
        <p>Deborah Sykes, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney in Memphis, said her office would not comment on Mr. Holly's accusations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenfeld said that since the strike began on Oct. 24, 54 Overnite trucks had been shot at, with one driver seriously injured.</p>
        <p>''There never were any shootings at an Overnite truck or an employee prior to Oct. 24,'' he said.</p>
        <p>David Cameron, a union spokesman, pointed to the company's accusations that one truck was hit by 38 bullets in a single incident while another was hit by 20 bullets. ''That points to a phony shooting up his own truck,'' Mr. Cameron said.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Holly's affidavit, he said that one terminal manager in Jackson, Tenn., ''asked me to break windows of Overnite trucks that were parked,'' while a terminal manager in Memphis said a day or two later, ''I would like you to cut lines and tires of unoccupied vehicles that are not rolling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holly said, ''I agreed to do it by saying no problem.''</p>
        <p>At several Overnite terminals the drivers and dockworkers voted to unionize more than five years ago, but they still do not have a contract. The union says it represents 3,600 workers at 37 terminals, but the company says that because of legal challenges the union represents only 1,800 at 22 of its 166 terminals. The company asserts that only 585 workers are on strike, while the union puts the number at 1,500.</p>
