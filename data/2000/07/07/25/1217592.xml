        <p>After complaining for years about the smell, pollution and truck traffic from garbage transfer stations, organizations and politicians in three Brooklyn neighborhoods filed a federal civil rights complaint yesterday against New York City and the state.</p>
        <p>''This area bears the brunt of waste transfer stations in New York City,'' said Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, a Democrat whose district includes the three neighborhoods, Red Hook, Greenpoint and Williamsburg. She noted that asthma rates are five times the national average. ''Teachers are complaining that children are not in class,'' she said. ''And the smell.''</p>

        <p>After complaining for years about the smell, pollution and truck traffic from garbage transfer stations, organizations and politicians in three Brooklyn neighborhoods filed a federal civil rights complaint yesterday against New York City and the state.</p>
        <p>''This area bears the brunt of waste transfer stations in New York City,'' said Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, a Democrat whose district includes the three neighborhoods, Red Hook, Greenpoint and Williamsburg. She noted that asthma rates are five times the national average. ''Teachers are complaining that children are not in class,'' she said. ''And the smell.''</p>
        <p>At least half the city's residential garbage is carried to waste transfer stations in and around these neighborhoods, according to the complaint filed yesterday with the civil rights division of the Environmental Protection Agency. The neighborhoods, where the income levels range from very poor to below average, are being forced to put up with a disproportionately high number of garbage sites, the complaint contends.</p>
        <p>The complaint, which is not a lawsuit but could be a precursor to one, asks the City Department of Sanitation to distribute garbage transfer sites more fairly and to oversee them more rigorously. There are about 75 waste transfer sites in the city: 24 are in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, and 6 are in the much smaller and much poorer Red Hook.</p>
        <p>''This is just not fair,'' Ms. Velazquez said. ''These are disenfranchised areas, so the city is dumping on them. Everyone in New York City should share the burden.''</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for the city and state said they had not yet seen the complaint and could not comment. The complaint maintains that the city is violating the federal Civil Rights Act by forcing a low-income population with a high percentage of blacks and Hispanics to endure the smell and pollution created by the transporting and dumping of garbage.</p>
        <p>Nearly all the 11,000 residents of Red Hook are black or Hispanic, and half have incomes below the poverty level, according to the 1990 census. The Greenpoint-Williamsburg area, with 138,000 residents, is about half Hispanic, with incomes that are below the city average.</p>
        <p>For community residents, this is an old grievance that has been worsening each year. While there have been some waste transfer sites on the Brooklyn waterfront for decades, the number increased sharply during the late 1980's, when commercial garbage companies responded to an increase in municipal fees by opening private sites in the Bronx and Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''Fifteen years ago,'' said Annette LaMotto of Greenpoint, ''it was so quiet and peaceful on weekends and at night. Then over the years, the trucks kept increasing. The noise kept increasing. The roads got so crowded. Now it's like hell.''</p>
        <p>Ms. LaMotto said that she and other members of a local organization had determined that as many as 10,000 truck trips were made daily around the neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>If the E.P.A. finds the complaint justified, it will work with the city to correct the problems. At best, the complaint could cause the city, state and federal governments to come up with ways to reduce the waste stream and to redistribute the burden of garbage disposal more fairly, said John McGetrick of Red Hook.</p>
        <p>''We should rebuild Brooklyn's waterfront communities to be something other than dumps,'' he said.</p>
