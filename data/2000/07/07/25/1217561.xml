        <p>For Philip Morris, the imminent political conventions are not so much about nominating presidential candidates and building party loyalty as they are about, well, macaroni. Macaroni in the shape of donkeys. Macaroni in the shape of elephants. Macaroni the company plans to hand out to delegates.</p>
        <p>This is macaroni with a purpose: to tell the assembled opinion makers and power brokers that Philip Morris is not just a tobacco company and hasn't been for some time, that it also sells other products -- Kraft macaroni among them.</p>
        <p>For many, conventions have little to do with politics and a lot to do with business -- polishing civic and corporate images, exploiting marketing opportunities, courting influence and turning what has long been an exercise in democracy into a huge corporate festival. The dazzling corporate sideshows put this year's gatherings -- next Monday through Aug. 3 for the Republicans in Philadelphia; Aug. 14-17 for the Democrats in Los Angeles -- in a class with the Olympics and the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>It is not just major corporations like Philip Morris, which has bigger plans for the Republican gathering but is not ignoring the Democratic one. Cities, too, see a chance to bask in the spotlight. Armed with studies putting the economic benefits of playing host to a political convention at $100 million or more, over a dozen cities -- including New York, Indianapolis and San Antonio -- lined up to be picked, offering millions of dollars in local support. This largess comes on top of the $13 million the federal government gives each party to hold its four-day convention. Yet in this headlong marketing rush, many are concerned. Some contend that the economic benefits are vastly overblown, while the risk to a city's image is underrated. Others call the conventions orgies of cash, providing yet another route for corporations to buy political access. Still others say that as conventions have increasingly lost their political role of nominating candidates and rallying the party faithful, corporations have stepped in to fill the vacuum.</p>
        <p>''The conventions have become Super Bowls of the influence of money on politics,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington nonprofit group. ''These are gala events where the most garish examples of excess appear.''</p>
        <p>The cities selected mounted all-out attacks to land the events along with promises of raising $35 million to $50 million in local funds for support services, mainly transportation, decorations and civic improvements. Tax-deductible contributions come to each city's host committee as cash or goods -- pagers from Motorola, software from Microsoft, discount tickets from US Airways and UAL's United Airlines.</p>
        <p>Local governments kick in cash as well. Los Angeles donated $4 million to close a last-minute gap for the Democratic convention. Philadelphia's effort is supported with $17 million from the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania and the city government, along with a $20 million letter of credit.</p>
        <p>To critics of campaign financing like Mr. Lewis, host committees have become a gray zone -- a way for parties to benefit from millions of unregulated dollars, raised with minimal disclosure and given out of civic pride as well as a desire to help one candidate. Even so, some cities, like Los Angeles, have struggled to raise enough money.</p>
        <p>Critics may rage, but cities that have landed conventions -- both now and in the past -- are thrilled. Even also-ran cities like Indianapolis say they benefited. And corporations on both coasts, local suppliers to national brands, are bubbling with enthusiasm about their plans for the conventions.</p>
        <p>''This is a fabulous opportunity,'' said Patrick McGranaghan, the vice president for marketing at Dale Carnegie Training and Associates, which is training thousands of corporate volunteers for Philadelphia. ''We are putting Dale Carnegie in front of every major corporation in the Delaware Valley and showing them what we do. It gives them a taste of Dale Carnegie training, and we hope they will come back and ask for more.''</p>
        <p>Jeremy's MicroBatch Ice Cream, a three-year-old Philadelphia company that recently produced the first beer-flavored ice cream, plans to donate $10,000 worth of its product to the media center, where 15,000 reporters will work.</p>
        <p>''We hope it gets hotter than blazes, so people will want something cool and refreshing,'' said Michelle Peranteau, a spokeswoman. ''There will be hundreds of thousands of people descending on our city. That's hundreds of thousands we could turn into MicroBatch lovers.''</p>
        <p>On a bigger scale, companies like Philip Morris, Motorola, McDonald's and Microsoft have donated money or products, or both. ''We welcome the opportunity to showcase our technology,'' said Norm Sandler, head of government relations for Motorola, which has supplied conventions since 1952 and will play host at a party to honor the House speaker,  Dennis J. Hastert, the Illinois Republican.</p>
        <p>Philip Morris gave $250,000 to the Philadelphia host committee, but the Los Angeles committee does not accept tobacco contributions. In Philadelphia, where the company will ''sponsor'' a downtown street to be temporarily renamed for the company, it will join other corporations in giving parties for politicians and delegates and it is giving away lots of food-related products. Besides the animal-shaped macaroni, it plans to stock hospitality suites and delegate ''goody bags'' with Altoids mints, Toblerone chocolates, Maxwell House coffee, Miller Beer and Philadelphia cream cheese.</p>
        <p>''When you are in a business that has some controversial aspects,'' said Peggy Roberts, the company's director of communications, ''it is important to our shareholders and employees that we try and build relationships in venues that are important to us.''</p>
        <p>In fact, when civic fund-raisers approach corporations, the pitch is often more about business than politics. After all, if a company wants political access, some say, it would be better off giving directly to the parties. ''We try to sell it as a marketing experience and not as a political contribution,'' said Eli Broad, chief executive of SunAmerica and co-chairman of the L.A. 2000 Host Committee. Mr. Broad gave $1 million to the effort, along with $1 million from SunAmerica's parent company, AIG.</p>
        <p>Each city has its own reason for seeking the spotlight. For Philadelphia, it is an opportunity to show off a spiffed-up downtown and a new convention center and to promote itself as a place to visit, do business and live. Los Angeles hopes the convention will erase memories of earthquakes, urban rioting and the O. J. Simpson trial and show the world that the city actually does have a downtown.</p>
        <p>''We've had fires, rains and floods, everything but locusts,'' said Noelia Rodriguez, chief executive of the host committee. ''Now we've turned the city around, and we believe it's our moment to shine.''</p>
        <p>Karen Buchholz, president of Philadelphia 2000, added, ''Getting this convention is like a seal of approval for Philadelphia.''</p>
        <p>But for the cities, it is more than civic pride, there is real money to be had.. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago estimated in a study there would be a direct financial benefit to Chicago of $132 million from the 1996 Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>''The hardest thing is to get people to come to your city in the first place,'' said Geoffry J. D. Hewings, a University of Illinois professor and the study's author. ''Hopefully, they will be attracted to it and will come back. And there is a lot of ego associated with these conventions. Lots of people enjoy the nonfinancial benefits of being close to power.''</p>
        <p>Others say the benefits are overrated and the risks underplayed. Many cities already have a thriving hotel business in August that must be subtracted from any convention revenue. Besides, it is hard to imagine cities like Philadelphia or Los Angeles needing to raise millions to market themselves. And a backlash is possible if baton-wielding police crack down on unruly demonstrators. Cities can have their images tarnished, as Seattle found after the disorder at the World Trade Organization meeting in December.</p>
        <p>''Does the convention make people say, 'Gee, I didn't know Los Angeles was there, maybe I'll go visit?' '' said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College. ''If you have a lame convention and fairly soporific candidates, it seems unlikely you would say, 'Boy, let's go see where Al Gore got nominated.' ''</p>
        <p>Roger Noll, an economics professor at Stanford University, added, ''It seems crazy for anyone to claim that the image of New York or San Francisco or Chicago hinges on getting any of these kinds of events.''</p>
        <p>Cities that have been convention hosts, or have come close to landing one, disagree. ''The event was fabulous for the city,'' said Susan Golding, mayor of San Diego, which was host to the 1996 Republican convention. ''It brings a great deal of public attention and a general feeling that if you can handle a national political convention, well, you can handle just about anything.''</p>
        <p>Fred Sainz, former Republican convention planner and now head of the San Diego convention center, said cities craved the visibility more than the dollars.</p>
        <p>''When reporters get bored with the conventions, as they do, they will write stories about the city,'' he said. ''Larry King going live with the bay and the skyline and sitting there in a short-sleeved shirt in cool August breezes -- that does a lot.''</p>
        <p>Indianapolis was a finalist for the 2000 Republican convention, and Michael McDaniel, chairman of the state Republican party, said the city had benefited anyway. ''We've had bookings in Indianapolis for events just as a result of being a finalist,'' he said. ''They thought they should check us out for conventions. There is no way to put a price tag on that ripple effect.''</p>
        <p>Still, for all the perceived benefits, raising money is not easy. In the days before the 1996 San Diego convention, the city was about $5 million short, causing a worried Dole campaign to tap its donor list. In Philadelphia, while the host committee boasts of raising more than $40 million, only about $10 million of that is cash from corporations.</p>
        <p>And fund-raising problems in Los Angeles have been the stuff of local headlines. Only two months before the convention was to begin, the host committee was still around $11 million short. The city contributed $4 million, and President Clinton came to Los Angeles to raise money, as well as lending his top fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe, to twist arms. As of early this month, the city was still $4 million short.</p>
        <p>As a result, when Ms. Rodriguez, head of the host committee, was interviewed earlier this month, she said Mayor Richard Riordan was in her office. What was he doing there? He was on the phone, she said, asking donors for money.</p>
