        <p>Deutsche Telekom's bid to enter the United States begins a political battle over tricky regulatory questions and fundamental trade policy issues. The company formally announced its intention to buy VoiceStream for $50.7 billion today.</p>
        <p>But opposition to the deal began to ferment in Washington during the highly publicized negotiations with VoiceStream. Deutsche Telekom has responded by retaining Lloyd Cutler, the former White House counsel to Presidents Clinton and Carter. Mr. Cutler's law firm, Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering, is engaged in a three-pronged attack on behalf of its new client. It must persuade Congress not to intervene, the White House to approve the deal and the Federal Communications Commission to approve the transfer of wireless telephone licenses.</p>
        <p>People involved in the deal and the legislative and regulatory fight said Mr. Cutler had turned to his golden Rolodex, urging lawmakers and other officials not to stand in the way.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom and VoiceStream have also hired more than half a dozen  lobbying and law firms with former White House officials and Congressional aides. They include Pat Griffin, the former top White House lobbyist in the Clinton administration, and Dan Tate Jr. of Cassidy &amp; Associates, a former White House official and aide to Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana.</p>
        <p>The lobbying has begun to pay off. The White House announced its opposition today to two pieces of legislation, drafted by Senator Ernest F. Hollings and supported by many top lawmakers, that could derail the acquisition. And the Communications Workers of America, a significant lobbying force in its own right, recently sent a letter to Congress supporting the deal.</p>
        <p>The deal's fate, though, will probably not be in the hands of President Clinton or William E. Kennard, the F.C.C. chairman, who today again promised he would scrutinize the acquisition closely. Since reviews by the F.C.C. and a host of other government agencies almost certainly cannot be completed before 2001, it will be up to the next president and the next chief of the F.C.C.</p>
        <p>The primary issue is the ownership of Deutsche Telekom. More than half of its stock is controlled by the German government, and even after the deal is completed, the government's stake will be 45 percent, far more than the 25 percent limit generally permitted by federal communications law.</p>
        <p>But the company and some lawyers say the law also contains an important exception for deals deemed to be in the public interest -- a test, they say, that is satisfied because the German government is a member of the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom plans to convey a message that at a time of rapid consolidation, the deal brings a new player to the table, increasing competition by lowering prices and encouraging innovation in the wireless telephone market.</p>
        <p>Top executives at the two companies said today in a telephone interview that they would come to Washington this week to convey that theme to the Federal Communications Commission and to other officials who have expressed skepticism about the deal.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the rhetoric about the transaction in Washington is merely an attempt by our large competitors to keep us from having access to resources to become competitive,'' said John Stanton, the chief executive of VoiceStream. ''This is pro-consumer and pro-competitive. It will create another large national competitor in the United States.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Deutsche Telekom's plan to pump $5 billion in new investments into VoiceStream, even before the deal is completed, to participate in a coming auction over spectrum licenses is widely hailed as good news at the F.C.C., which has been trying to stimulate as much interest, and as many large bids, as possible.</p>
        <p>The regulatory battle pits a pre-World War II federal communications law aimed at discouraging foreign investment in the United States against a 1997 World Trade Organization agreement on telecommunications services that was meant to do the opposite.</p>
        <p>Most experts agree that the F.C.C. appears to have the authority to approve the deal, even though the law is murky. But Congress is flirting with changing the law and eliminating any ambiguities.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, renewed his criticism of the deal and vowed to press forward with legislation supported by a number of Congressional leaders, including the majority and minority leaders, that would block the deal. Mr. Hollings has sponsored two measures that would block the deal.</p>
        <p>One is a rider to an appropriations bill that would prevent the F.C.C. from approving the deal for a year. A second bill would permanently block the deal as long as the German government owned more than 25 percent of Deutsche Telekom.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hollings's legislation suffered a setback when the White House announced that it could not support the legislation.</p>
        <p>''We believe that these various regulatory and antitrust reviews can address the senator's concern and new legislation is not necessary,'' said Jake Seiwert, a White House spokesman.</p>
        <p>Some of Deutsche Telekom's potential rivals in the United States have urged lawmakers to step in, maintaining that it would be unfair to permit entry in the United States of a foreign company that enjoys the backing of a foreign government. The competitors themselves have laid low, Congressional aides say, in part because they have interests in possibly expanding abroad and in part because they want to leave the door open to foreign investments in their companies.</p>
