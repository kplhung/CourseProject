        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>When I read that a proposed tax cut for married couples will cost a projected $292 billion over 10 years (news article, July 21), I wonder: When did we as a nation start making spending and tax decisions framed by their supposed effect over 10 years?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>When I read that a proposed tax cut for married couples will cost a projected $292 billion over 10 years (news article, July 21), I wonder: When did we as a nation start making spending and tax decisions framed by their supposed effect over 10 years?</p>
        <p>The effect of this is to make cuts seem bigger, spending more generous and political promises easier to fudge. I think we would be better served by knowing what a program or cut is going to cost next year compared with this year, not some mythical amount that a Congress three administrations from now will overturn anyway with its own 10-year plan.</p>
