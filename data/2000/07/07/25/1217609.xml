        <p>Reinventing or in some cases abandoning the rituals of party gatherings past, the Republican National Convention that begins on Monday will more than ever amount to a lavish multimedia spectacle that pushes controversy to the sidelines in favor of an unabashed celebration of the goals and vision of the party standard-bearer, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>Those expecting angry debate on issues like abortion, gun control and school prayer will be sorely disappointed. In its place, the convention will beam ''compassion videos'' onto three high-tech screens hanging over the stage in the First Union Center here. They will document the healing power of social programs in places like Cleveland and El Paso that were developed with little or no government support.</p>

        <p>Reinventing or in some cases abandoning the rituals of party gatherings past, the Republican National Convention that begins on Monday will more than ever amount to a lavish multimedia spectacle that pushes controversy to the sidelines in favor of an unabashed celebration of the goals and vision of the party standard-bearer, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>Those expecting angry debate on issues like abortion, gun control and school prayer will be sorely disappointed. In its place, the convention will beam ''compassion videos'' onto three high-tech screens hanging over the stage in the First Union Center here. They will document the healing power of social programs in places like Cleveland and El Paso that were developed with little or no government support.</p>
        <p>Missing, too, from the rostrum will be the usual parade of elected officials introducing other elected officials for the kinds of lengthy speeches that act as television-audience repellent.</p>
        <p>A few politicians will still have oratorical roles, and it still will be the remarks by Republican stars like former Gen. Colin L. Powell and Senator John McCain of Arizona that are likely to dominate the window of network news coverage that on most nights will open at about 10 p.m.</p>
        <p>But most other speeches will be five minutes or less and mere embroidery for each evening's elaborate ''story line'' modeled on Mr. Bush's proposals for education, defense and Social Security and featuring ordinary Americans talking about their lives.</p>
        <p>Officials even say the Republican whipping boy, President Clinton, may rarely be invoked. ''This convention really is about George Bush,'' said Andy Card, general co-chairman and chief conceptualizer of the $63 million event. ''Other conventions were more about the party and less about the candidate. This on every single night is about Governor Bush. It's about what he stands for. It's about people who symbolize what he stands for.''</p>
        <p>If political conventions long ago stopped picking nominees and started selling them, the Republicans are intent this summer on refining the tone of the sales pitch and imposing an unparalleled degree of message discipline on the proceedings. They are able to try this thanks to an extraordinary level of solidarity this year. The Republican base is so firmly in Mr. Bush's corner, organizers say, that they have fewer worries than the Democrats about reassuring party regulars.</p>
        <p>That has freed them to tailor their appeal during the four-day convention more directly to Democrats and independents. Though Mr. Card says that some speakers will pointedly contrast Republican and Democratic policies, the accent will remain on the positive. Indeed, even the convention's slightly abstract theme -- ''Renewing America's Purpose. Together'' -- has the ring of gentle, communal house cleaning.</p>
        <p>''I think there was a sense that one thing was to make this not about the party, but about the issues the party stands for,'' said Russell Schriefer, a Bush media consultant who produced the videos. ''To make it broader, and more inclusive.''</p>
        <p>The unanswered question in this serving up of politics on a satin pillow is whether anyone besides the delegates, the news media and Mr. Bush's extended family will pay much attention. Lacking any ''story line'' with inherent conflict, the Republican proceedings are in danger of being dismissed as irrelevant by much of the public. In a recent poll by Harvard's Vanishing Voter project, 43 percent of respondents said they would not tune in to the political extravaganza here, while 38 percent said they would not watch the one staged by Democrats in Los Angeles next month.</p>
        <p>In unorthodox ways, the organizers, aware of the public's waning enthusiasm, are trying to turn the convention into better television. It is a strategy that Mr. Card, an ebullient Massachusetts Republican who served as transportation secretary under Mr. Bush's father, himself calls ''high risk.'' How else to describe the discussions by Republican convention planners over whether to ask such unlikely participants as the rock groups Smash Mouth and Goo Goo Dolls to perform during the four-day event?</p>
        <p>''One of the great challenges,'' Mr. Card said, ''is to get people to pay attention to the convention who were turned off by past ones.''</p>
        <p>The language of television seeps into almost every conversation about what will transpire in the First Union Center, where workers are affixing the stars-and-stripes motif to the stage and finishing the installation of 330 speakers, 650 lights and 6,600 miles of fiber-optic cable.</p>
        <p>''I view this as a mini-series that has to be told over four nights,'' Mr. Card said, referring to the themes that will roll out in nightly installments, like ''Strength and Security with a Purpose,'' on the second night, which also happens to coincide with the 10th anniversary of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the impetus for Operation Desert Storm.</p>
        <p>Thus the evening will include a remote transmission from the deck of the U.S.S. New Jersey, anchored on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River, where former Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf will talk by satellite to the conventioneers. The episode has an added potential advantage of reminding voters of the high-water mark of the senior Mr. Bush's term in the White House. The second night will also play off the notion of America's strength in other areas, like trade policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Card said the nightly themes were enlargements of signature issues for Mr. Bush, as derived from his stump speeches. Monday's theme is ''Opportunity with a Purpose: Leave No Child Behind''; Wednesday's will be ''Prosperity with a Purpose'' and Thursday, when he delivers his acceptance speech, the theme will be ''President with a Purpose.''</p>
        <p>''Instead of doing 'bio' just on one night, we're doing 'bio' throughout,'' is how Mr. Schriefer put it.</p>
        <p>The very look of the convention hall itself, a four-year-old sports arena, will give the proceedings more of a variety show feel. The old-fashioned dais has been banished, replaced by a wide stage with a podium that retracts into the floor. More speakers will be announced by an offstage voice, and musical interludes will occur more frequently. ''We're trying to be a little bit more entertaining, a little faster-moving,'' said David J. Nash, the convention's executive producer and once the producer of Radio City Music Hall's Easter and Christmas productions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush will be the program's roving eminence, broadcast into the hall each night by satellite from somewhere on the campaign trail. His speech -- alone now on Thursday night, the vice-presidential nominee's having been moved this year to Wednesday night -- will be the de facto keynote address, as Mr. Card and the other organizers opted not to designate one. So far, Mr. McCain is the only one of Mr. Bush's opponents from the primaries who has been invited to give a prominent address.</p>
        <p>To a minority of viewers, who watch the proceedings unfiltered on, say, C-Span, which is supplying the pool coverage, or on one of the cable networks that will often be concentrating on the stage, the gist of the Republican story might be apparent. Everyone else may have a hard time following the script, and those in charge of creating it say the problem is unavoidable. In fact, the odd reality of the conventions is that the harder the parties work to woo network coverage, the less the old-line networks are apt to put them on the air.</p>
        <p>This quirk is what the organizers say has compelled them to become even wilier about the electronic tricks of television, the satellite feeds, the narratives on video, in selling their story. ''It's like the Academy Awards,'' Mr. Schriefer said. ''You go to the clips.''</p>
