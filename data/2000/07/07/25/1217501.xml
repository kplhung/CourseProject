        <p>Most people who are allergic to pollen presumably make it a point to avoid blooming fields of ragweed or goldenrod.</p>
        <p>But most people allergic to fish probably figure that to avoid an unpleasant reaction, they need only avoid eating anything that contains fish.</p>
        <p>Think again.</p>
        <p>Researchers have found that for people allergic to fish, it is enough just to inhale some of the allergens wafting off the skin to have a reaction. And that, the study says, means that the piscatorial equivalent of the field in bloom is the fish market.</p>
        <p>The report, published earlier this year in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, was prepared by researchers from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester and researchers from a hospital in Madrid. Mayo researchers released details of the study this month.</p>
        <p>The study was conducted at an open-air fish market in Madrid, where allergy patients have reported reactions. Hypersensitivity to fish is a significant problem in several European countries, the study said.</p>
        <p>On 41 different days, researchers took air samples in the market, and they consistently found fish allergens.</p>
