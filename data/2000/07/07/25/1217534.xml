        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Unbiased Accounting'' (editorial, July 18): As you acknowledge, there is no evidence that non-audit work by accounting firms has led to any impropriety.</p>
        <p>Indeed, a recent report by the Panel on Audit Effectiveness, formed at the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission, concluded that ''both the profession and the quality of audits are fundamentally sound.'' The panel said it could find no evidence that providing non-audit services had hurt audit quality, and in approximately 25 percent of the cases it actually improved audit quality.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C.'s proposal to restrict the services offered by accounting firms represents a fundamental restructuring of a profession that has, for the last century, given investors the reliable, independent data they need. A decision to tell some businesses what services they may offer and other businesses from whom they can buy services is an extraordinary economic intervention.</p>
