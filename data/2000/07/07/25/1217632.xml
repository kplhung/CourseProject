        <p>Priceline.com reported a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss of a penny a share as its sales more than tripled. Investors were not impressed, however, as the Norwalk, Conn.-based company's shares plunged 22 percent. For the quarter ending in June, the company reported that excluding several one-time items, it lost $1.6 million, or 1 cent a diluted share, compared with a loss of $13.9 million, or 10 cents a diluted share, in the second quarter of 1999. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted a loss of 3 cents a share. Revenue was $352.1 million, 216 percent greater than year-earlier revenue of $111.6 million. Priceline.com's shares fell $8.9375, to $31.125.</p>
