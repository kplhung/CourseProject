        <p>After years of settling for a spot far to the rear, Lou Cizek of Teaneck, N.J., thought he had found gold yesterday, arriving at the Great Lawn in Central Park early enough to stake out a patch of green close to the stage where the New York Philharmonic would perform.</p>
        <p>At 2:30 p.m., he had begun to unpack blankets, bottles of Zinfandel, roast beef sandwiches and Monterey Jack cheese. The plan, Mr. Cizek  said, was to hold the choice spot until 12 of his friends joined him after work for the 8 p.m. concert. The evening, he imagined, would be full of laughs, drinks and a lovely performance of Copland's ''Rodeo,'' all under the stars on a comfortable summer night.</p>

        <p>After years of settling for a spot far to the rear, Lou Cizek of Teaneck, N.J., thought he had found gold yesterday, arriving at the Great Lawn in Central Park early enough to stake out a patch of green close to the stage where the New York Philharmonic would perform.</p>
        <p>At 2:30 p.m., he had begun to unpack blankets, bottles of Zinfandel, roast beef sandwiches and Monterey Jack cheese. The plan, Mr. Cizek  said, was to hold the choice spot until 12 of his friends joined him after work for the 8 p.m. concert. The evening, he imagined, would be full of laughs, drinks and a lovely performance of Copland's ''Rodeo,'' all under the stars on a comfortable summer night.</p>
        <p>Then, reality struck.</p>
        <p>After it was confirmed yesterday that mosquitoes from Central Park were carrying the West Nile virus, the city canceled the concert, and the park was ordered closed by 9:30, but people continued to enter. Spraying began at 10 p.m.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cizek acknowledged the need for caution, but asked why it had to happen last night, of all nights.</p>
        <p>''After 15 years, I finally came out here and got a good spot, and now they cancel this thing,'' said Mr. Cizek, 39, a ski instructor. But a smile snuck through his look of dejection as he packed his food and took apart the flimsy flagpole he had planned to erect so his friends would be able to find him. ''I have 12 friends who were coming out here, all the way from New Jersey. I was going to impress them with the best seats ever.''</p>
        <p>The concert was rescheduled for tonight, but the forecast for rain left few optimistic that it would go on.</p>
        <p>Still, many people who were riding their bikes, jogging, tossing a Frisbee or strolling through the 843-acre park yesterday said they understood the need to close the park and spray. Even those who had worked for weeks to put on yesterday's concert, an event that attracts tens of thousands for a night of music, said they could not in good conscience argue with the mayor's decision.</p>
        <p>''The health and safety of the people come before the concert,'' said Bill Thomas, acting executive director of the philharmonic, noting that he received the bad news in a phone call from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at 2:50 p.m.  ''Of course, we're disappointed, but that's what the mayor gets the big bucks for -- to make the tough decisions.''</p>
        <p>The mayor's decision did rankle more than a few people using the park.</p>
        <p>At Heckscher Fields southeast of 65th Street, Joe Comizio showed up early with a bag of bats and awaited his teammates for their 5:30 p.m.  softball game. Instead, he said, the Parks Department had canceled all play. So instead of handling drives at his shortstop position, Mr. Comizio stood around and called his friends on his cell phone, making sure they knew there would be no game.</p>
        <p>''We're towards the end of the season and everyone is vying for a playoff position,'' Mr. Comizio said. ''Now these games have to be made up. Makeup games have to be played on either Randalls Island or Ward Island, and that's a hassle for everyone to get to.''</p>
        <p>A longtime fan who likes to watch the corporate boys play ball, a 74-year-old man who gave his name as Murphy said the cancellation did not sit well with him, either. ''I don't use profanity; let's just say I'm highly perturbed,'' said Murphy, who said he had been playing ball or watching games there since he was a boy.</p>
        <p>Others weren't so sure what to think about the mayor's decision.</p>
        <p>Andree Brown, who came to the park to hit line drives to her son, James Fitzgerald, on a diamond at the Great Lawn, said at first that she thought it was smart to be cautious, cancel the concert and order spraying. But then she  thought of the pesticides covering the park she loved.</p>
        <p>''I think that's awful,'' she said. ''Think of all the things we breathe in the city. And now this. I don't like the spraying from the sky.''</p>
        <p>Others simply lamented an early end to what they had hoped would be a special night.</p>
        <p>David Markert, 25, an Internet consultant, and his fiancee, Lesley O'Malley, had planned a romantic evening. Because he was not working yesterday, Mr. Market headed to the park early, two folding chairs under his arm. Then, just as he was prepared to unwind on the field, a police officer came his way with the bad news.</p>
        <p>''We were going to bring some salad and some sandwiches and wine, and relax,'' said Mr. Markert, as he strolled from the Great Lawn back to the Upper East Side. ''We don't go to the philharmonic much, so this was a great chance to enjoy it.''</p>
        <p>Bobbi Anderson, who heard the news from another disappointed concertgoer just as she arrived at the Great Lawn, was beside herself. ''I had worked so hard to make a nice picnic,'' she said. ''Lots of cookies.''</p>
        <p>Instead, only moments after strolling up, Ms. Anderson, her daughter, Randi Anderson, and her grand-nephew, Justin Howard, 18, of Los Angeles, had turned back. They missed the concert, she said, but at least they still had their food.</p>
        <p>''Now, we're going to her apartment,'' Ms. Anderson said, speaking of her daughter's home on East 74th Street. ''We'll have our picnic on her terrace.''</p>
