        <p>New York State has expanded a program that provides tax credits and other incentives for companies to invest in economically troubled areas, adding zones in which the incentives will be offered.</p>
        <p>As a result of legislation authorizing the six new districts, which Gov. George E. Pataki recently signed into law, the state will soon send forms to all its municipalities and counties so that those that want such economic development zones may apply to have areas in their jurisdictions chosen.</p>
        <p>Even as they report that the state's overall economy is on the upswing, state officials say they expect many applications because not every community has shared in the good times. When Mr. Pataki approved the legislation, he said the expansion ''means we can do even more to ensure that every community across New York participates in the state's growing economy.''</p>
        <p>The measure will increase to 58 the number of zones under the program, which began in 1987 to help communities with high unemployment and poverty. The program was later expanded to aid areas hurt by the closing of military bases and other defense cutbacks.</p>
        <p>Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, which administers the program, said the latest addition of zones was part of an effort to ''encourage even more opportunities for job creation'' across the state.</p>
        <p>Areas that already have such zones include East New York in Brooklyn, South Jamaica in Queens, Port Morris in the Bronx, East Harlem and cities like Buffalo, Albany, Rochester and Plattsburgh. Because of the criteria for the six new zones, three of them are likely to be in rural areas, state officials say.</p>
        <p>Under the program, a company receives a basic tax credit of 25 percent of the amount of its investment for locating or expanding a business in a zone, or for investing in building a community facility, like a day care center, in a zone.</p>
        <p>The new state budget added millions of dollars in tax credits to the program, the governor's office said, and at least 125,000 people have been employed at more than 2,600 businesses aided by the program. The program's name was recently changed from the Economic Development Zones Program to the Empire Zones Program.</p>
