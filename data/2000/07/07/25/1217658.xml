        <p>Robert H. Giles, a longtime newspaper editor and publisher, will be the next curator of Harvard University's Nieman Foundation for professional journalists.</p>
        <p>Friends of Mr. Giles confirmed yesterday that Harvard's president, Neil L. Rudenstine, had told Mr. Giles last week of the appointment to head the 62-year-old Nieman program, which brings 24 United States and foreign journalists to the university for a year's study. The appointment was first reported yesterday by Editor &amp; Publisher magazine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giles declined to comment, and the university said it would make an announcement on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Unions had challenged the candidacy of Mr. Giles, who earned the enmity of strikers when he was editor of The Detroit News.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giles will replace Bill Kovach, who has been curator for the last decade. He is the second journalist named this summer to a highly visible academic post. In June, James R. Bettinger, a former city editor at The San Jose Mercury-News, was named director of Stanford University's Knight Fellowship Program.</p>
