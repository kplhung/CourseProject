        <p>It's easy to take pot shots at sport utility vehicles as boorish vehicles driven by boorish people (letters, July 20). But the S.U.V. was Detroit's natural response to the demands of suburban families with several children.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It's easy to take pot shots at sport utility vehicles as boorish vehicles driven by boorish people (letters, July 20). But the S.U.V. was Detroit's natural response to the demands of suburban families with several children.</p>
        <p>If you ever tried to put two modern baby seats in the back seat of a compact sedan, you will remember thinking that what would be really nice would be a slightly larger vehicle with room for a stroller or two. When the children become teenagers, fitting two of your own plus a friend each is an impossibility unless you drive either one large car or two smaller cars.</p>
        <p>Some of what has been said about S.U.V.'s is against the car, and against suburban sprawl. So let's solve the S.U.V. problem by continuing to enhance their design.</p>
