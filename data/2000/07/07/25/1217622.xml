        <p>BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, said yesterday that it had resigned the account of Netpliance after only five months, citing a significant cutback in ad spending. Netpliance sells the I-Opener, an Internet appliance offering e-mail without a computer.</p>
        <p>''Regretfully, dollars available to support Netpliance's marketing efforts turned out to be significantly less than half of what was anticipated,'' said Jeff Mordos, chief operating officer at BBDO New York. When Netpliance changed agencies in February, billings were estimated at more than $15 million.</p>
