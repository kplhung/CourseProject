        <p>BP AMOCO introduced a new model of gas station yesterday, and the least important item for sale is the gas.</p>
        <p>The prototype of what will be a nationwide line of new stations, called BP Connect, was outfitted with solar panels, and spiffed up with the new green, yellow and white BP sunburst-shaped symbol.

        <p>BP AMOCO introduced a new model of gas station yesterday, and the least important item for sale is the gas.</p>
        <p>The prototype of what will be a nationwide line of new stations, called BP Connect, was outfitted with solar panels, and spiffed up with the new green, yellow and white BP sunburst-shaped symbol. Customers will be able to check the forecast for an impending thunderstorm on a small screen at the pump, buy a bottle of wine and some fresh-baked croissants at a neon-free supermarket inside, or log in to the latest news at an e-commerce kiosk.</p>
        <p>The decidedly upscale new digs are a launching pad for the company's new $7 million rebranding campaign that aims to reposition BP Amoco, an old-economy gas station giant, into a progressive, environmentally friendly retailer that goes, in the company's own words, ''beyond petroleum.''</p>
        <p>The decision to introduce a new brand image and spruce up its service stations comes at a time when, as gas prices increase, competition for customer loyalty is especially fierce. Not only must BP Amoco deal with the consumers' growing sentiment of hostility toward gas companies, it also has to figure out how to best use its four major brands: BP, Amoco, Arco, and Castrol.</p>
        <p>The rebranding campaign was seen by brand analysts as a way of increasing operating margins.</p>
        <p>''The retail petroleum business is a dull, boring and uninteresting business in which the drivers of preference are location and price, and brands have not played a very significant role in gas stations,'' said John K. Grace, executive director of Interbrand Corporation, a brand consulting company. ''Because branding has been weak, consumers have a difficult time differentiating among top quality players. These petroleum manufacturers are missing the boat in terms of what role brand can play.''</p>
        <p>While the price at the pump may be on the minds of most drivers this summer, there is a ''growing and large percentage of people who don't go to gas stations for gas,'' said Peter Dixon, senior partner at Lippincott &amp; Margulies, a corporate identity consulting company owned by Marsh &amp; McLennan.</p>
        <p>Indeed, BP Amoco is looking to pull drivers into the stations' stores, where they can buy items that are more profitable to sell than gasoline. While filling their tanks, customers can order a cafe latte that will be waiting for them once they've finished pumping their gas. If they really want to rush, BP is working on wireless technology that will enable them to send in their payments ahead of time.</p>
        <p>The goal is to have half of the stations' revenue coming from gas sales and the other half coming from the convenience store, Doug Ford, BP Amoco's chief executive for refining and marketing, told reporters yesterday at a Georgia test site for the new station. Currently, 80 percent of revenue comes from gasoline sales and the rest from retail sales.</p>
        <p>''To me this is a real estate business,'' Mr. Ford said. ''We're managing a particular site.''</p>
        <p>BP Amoco, which analysts say has always been particularly sensitive to brand identity, began discussing branding as soon as its $48.2 billion acquisition of Amoco was complete in January 1999. Both brands needed a face lift: Amoco's stations had kept the same design for the last 20 years and BP for the last 12. The company hired Landor &amp; Associates, a division of Young &amp; Rubicam, to research consumer attitudes toward the stations. Landor found that customers liked Amoco products but thought the red, white and blue stations were too dark. At the same time, they found the green and yellow BP colors appealing.</p>
        <p>Sir John Browne, BP Amoco's chief executive, decided that if BP Amoco was going to be recognized as a global brand, it needed to have one strong identity, a company official said.</p>
        <p>The advertising to promote the new brand image was created by Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group, which was named by BP Amoco as its global agency in November. The ads, which focus on BP's role as a green company, will start running in print and on television today. One commercial asks: ''Is it possible to drive a car and still have a clean environment? Can business go further and be a force for good?'' BP says it plans to spend $25 million a fiscal quarter on its branding campaign.</p>
        <p>The first BP Connect stations will open in Indianapolis, Cleveland, and London this year. The second round of station openings will include Chicago, Atlanta, and Sydney, Australia. The prototype was tested in an old warehouse outside of Atlanta because of its proximity to the suppliers in charge of making the new pump with its LCD screen.</p>
        <p>The largest BP Connect sites will be 4,200 square feet. They are airy and open: none of the center-aisle shelves are much taller than waist level.</p>
        <p>The stores are divided into five sections: a food service section, a beverage section, an impulse-buying section with snacks, a convenience-store section and an Internet section. The lighting changes with each section. The food service section has a warm, golden glow while the milk-and-eggs portion of the convenience section has a flourescent tinge.</p>
        <p>Inside the store, the offerings are localized: customers using the Paris station, for example, will be able to find foie gras.</p>
        <p>''It sounds to me like what BP has done is that they woke up one morning and said you know something, we're not in the gasoline business, we're in the retail business,'' said Clive Chajet of Chajet Consultancy, a brand consulting firm. ''BP has recognized that their product is a commodity and they are incapable on the product level to differentiate their brand from competitors.' ''</p>
        <p>But some critics, like Charles T. Maxwell, senior petroleum analyst at Weeden &amp; Company, are not convinced that customers will benefit from some of the extra add-ons. ''Maybe this is one stop shopping but I always like to go to a grocery store to buy my groceries,'' Mr. Maxwell said. ''The grease and parts and shout and clatter and spilled gasoline don't go in my mind with matters of food.''</p>
