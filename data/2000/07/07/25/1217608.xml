        <p>Kenneth A. Gibson, who as Newark's mayor for 16 years was the first black person elected to lead a major Northeastern city, was indicted today on federal fraud, bribery and conspiracy charges in connection with his consulting firm's management of a $50 million school construction project in Irvington.</p>
        <p>Announcing the 18-count indictment of the former mayor and two associates in his Gibson Associates engineering firm, Robert J. Cleary, the United States attorney for New Jersey, said Mr. Gibson had ''ripped off'' the Irvington Board of Education by overbilling it for some work done and falsely billing it for work that was never done.</p>
        <p>He also said that Mr. Gibson, 68, had bribed two board members and used his Newark firm, which he has run since leaving office in 1986, as a ''personal, tax-free piggy bank'' to funnel the money into personal investments and expenses. In the end, Mr. Cleary said, it was the children of Irvington who suffered, as the project managed by Mr. Gibson's firm ran out of money in 1995 before it was completed.</p>
        <p>''In our view, there is a public trust even given his current role, in which he has a fiduciary responsibility to provide honest services,'' Mr. Cleary said at a news conference here.</p>
        <p>When he was elected mayor in 1970, Mr. Gibson became a national spokesman for the plight of older cities, and in 1982 he almost won the Democratic nomination for governor. But after four terms in City Hall, he was defeated in 1986 by the current mayor and a former ally, Sharpe James.</p>
        <p>Twelve years later, Mr. Gibson attempted a comeback, but narrowly lost in his bid to unseat James W. Treffinger, a Republican, as Essex County executive, despite a Democratic edge in voter registrations.</p>
        <p>Still, his name recognition, the contacts he made while in office and the political history his tenure evokes have aided Mr. Gibson, who is trained as a civil engineer, in winning consulting contracts with public agencies like the Essex County Improvement Authority and the Passaic Valley Sewer Authority, as well as a number of local governments in the state and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Indicted with Mr. Gibson today were Camille Savoca, 53, of Newark, the vice president and co-owner of the firm, and Mr. Gibson's companion, and William Bernowich, 53, of Washingtonville, N.Y., who was project manager on the Irvington job. The three co-defendants were not arrested; they will be arraigned at a date yet to be scheduled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bernowich would not comment on the charges. Mr. Gibson and Ms. Savoca issued a statement through their lawyer, Cathy Fleming, calling the indictment ''unfortunate and unwarranted,'' but one they were aware might be coming as a result of a four-year investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
        <p>Privately, associates of Mr. Gibson described him as unsurprised and seemingly unperturbed by the charges, in part because of the many investigations he has survived.</p>
        <p>In an interview when he was mayor, Mr. Gibson, asked about investigations his administration faced on matters from its hiring practices to its purchasing and housing programs, observed, ''In my 13 years in office, there has never been a month when we're not being investigated.''</p>
        <p>In 1980, the Essex County prosecutor, George L. Schneider, charged him with giving out a no-show job. Mr. Gibson was acquitted after a six-week trial.</p>
        <p>Investigations into Newark's political leadership have continued in the last decade, leading to the convictions of nine sanitation officials in the Gibson administration, two members of the City Council and the top aide to Mayor James.</p>
        <p>Two former members of the Irvington Board of Education are mentioned in today's indictment as unindicted co-conspirators, said Ralph J. Marra Jr., an assistant United States attorney. The indictment charges that in 1992, Mr. Gibson met with the two board members and proposed to pay them each $3,000 to $4,000 to show his appreciation for receiving the construction contract, and that he later paid at least one. Mr. Marra would not name the members or say whether they were cooperating with the prosecution.</p>
        <p>The contract was to pay Mr. Gibson's firm between $4 million and $5 million to be the construction manager for the building of the Thurgood Marshall Elementary School and the renovation of two other schools, according to the indictment.</p>
        <p>From 1991 to 1995, the Irvington project was the Gibson firm's primary source of income, and the indictment charges that money raised from overbilling, double billing and false billing was funneled to three real estate investment firms in which Mr. Gibson had substantial financial interests.</p>
        <p>News of the federal investigation first leaked out in 1998 when F.B.I. investigators served a search warrant on Mr. Gibson, just three months before he was defeated for Essex County executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibson has said that when the project ran out of money in 1995 and contractors walked off the job, he kept his employees working at his own expense to maintain security at the buildings being renovated.</p>
        <p>When the school board refused to pay $1 million in costs that he said he had incurred, Mr. Gibson threatened to sue, and in 1998 the school board approved a settlement giving him $450,000. State investigators also subsequently faulted Irvington officials for improperly transferring nearly $4 million of the school construction money into the city's budget and said that that move was responsible in part for the halting of the project.</p>
