        <p>Five months after pleading guilty to one count of corruption, William L.

        <p>Five months after pleading guilty to one count of corruption, William L. Paroli Sr., the former chairman of the Dutchess County Republican Party, was sentenced today by a federal judge to 21 months in prison, capping a sometimes bizarre scandal that heralded the end of a powerful city political machine.</p>
        <p>The sentence marked the most notable victory yet for federal prosecutors in their three-year investigation into a web of corruption in Mr. Paroli's hometown, Poughkeepsie, the heart of a county best known as a pastoral retreat. But more than anything, the scandal captured the public's imagination by offering tales of strongman politics, videotaped sex, homicide and a suspicious suicide.</p>
        <p>As if to prolong the drama, Mr. Paroli's lawyers and federal prosecutors delayed his sentencing hearing several times because of  wrangling among lawyers and scheduling conflicts with Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr., who recently presided over another case involving a high-profile Republican: the tax-fraud trial of Albert J. Pirro Jr., the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney.</p>
        <p>Today, though, Mr. Paroli's hearing in Federal District Court here ventured into the realm of pathos when his lawyer, Andrew Rubin, noted that Mr. Paroli, 72, was suffering from prostate cancer and hearing loss, had been treated for depression for most of his adult life, and had even suffered a serious shoulder injury recently after he ''fell off a piece of machinery.''</p>
        <p>Despite those pleas, though, Judge Parker sentenced Mr. Paroli to the maximum that he could have received under the plea agreement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Paroli, who was also assessed penalties totaling $24,300, is scheduled to begin his sentence on Aug. 21.</p>
        <p>Mr. Paroli showed no visible reaction to the sentence; nor did his family, who sat quietly and tensely in the gallery.</p>
        <p>But in brief remarks to Judge Parker before the sentencing, Mr. Paroli, his voice cracking, mumbled, ''I apologize to my family for the embarrassment I caused them.''</p>
        <p>And on that humble note, Mr. Paroli's legal woes and, in all likelihood, political career, ground to an inglorious conclusion. Once regarded as a pivotal and intimidating force in the cozy one-party world of Dutchess politics, Mr. Paroli admitted in his plea deal that he had conspired with other officials to extort money from companies doing business in Poughkeepsie.</p>
        <p>Mr. Paroli also acknowledged that he had misused his political power to enrich himself, other officials and the local Republican Party by tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Paroli, a retired police detective, became active in politics in the mid-1970's, eventually becoming the chairman of the county party while also working as the county's Republican elections commissioner.</p>
        <p>But in May 1999, he was arrested on charges that he had forced businessmen to pay the Poughkeepsie and Dutchess Republican parties in exchange for permits and tax breaks.</p>
        <p>In all, Mr. Paroli was charged with 19 counts of corruption counts. And at first, Mr. Paroli blamed two former town officials who were also indicted by federal authorities: Basil Raucci, the town's former tax assessor, and Fred Andros, the former water superintendent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raucci was found drowned in 1997 in the Hudson River in a death that has raised suspicions among residents. Mr. Andros was sentenced two weeks ago to 33 months in prison on one conspiracy count, after reaching a plea agreement and telling federal authorities that he had delivered cash bribes to Mr. Paroli at his county office.</p>
        <p>What complicated matters, though, was Mr. Andros's own personal scandal. In December 1999, Mr. Andros shot himself in the head, apparently in a suicide attempt, just before the police were going to charge him in connection with the October 1999 killing of Susan Fassett, Poughkeepsie's former personnel director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andros was later charged with murder in connection with the killing of Ms. Fassett, and the police also arrested Dawn Silvernail, a Greene County resident, and charged her with similar counts.</p>
        <p>Ms. Silvernail, in turn, blamed Mr. Andros, saying that he had told her he was worried that Ms. Fassett would ruin his plea agreement in the corruption case.</p>
        <p>In addition, Ms. Silvernail said that Mr. Andros had paid her to have sex with Ms. Fassett inside a town water-pumping station, and that Mr. Andros videotaped the trysts before joining in.</p>
        <p>The murder charges are still pending against Ms. Silvernail and Mr. Andros. But Mr. Andros was supposed to be the government's star witness against Mr. Paroli, and the charges against him in a murder case undermined his credibility, forcing prosecutors to make a plea deal with Mr. Paroli.</p>
        <p>Only Mr. Paroli's family and close friends attended today's hearing, a far cry from the crowds of party faithful who used to pay homage to Mr. Paroli at political events.</p>
        <p>And in his plea for leniency, Mr. Rubin, Mr. Paroli's lawyer, noted that Mr. Paroli's financial situation was rickety, and that his wife suffered from arthritis, depression and other ailments.</p>
        <p>As a result, Judge Parker postponed the payment of the $24,300 in fines until after Mr. Paroli's release from prison.</p>
        <p>Still, Judge Parker was stern in meting out the punishment. ''The lesson in this matter is,'' he said, ''you sold out the citizens of Poughkeepsie you were obligated to serve.''</p>
