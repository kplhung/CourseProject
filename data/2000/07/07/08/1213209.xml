        <p>Kuwait is further along the road toward social liberalism than most of its Persian Gulf neighbors, with a woman at the helm of Kuwait University, a female ambassador and women outnumbering men in public schools. But if Kuwaitis are to achieve any semblance of the country's constitutional guarantee of ''equal rights'' for men and women, full political rights must be granted to women. That would serve as an example for other gulf nations that have yet to give women the right to vote.</p>
        <p>Kuwaiti feminists recently suffered a setback when the constitutional court dismissed cases petitioning for women's voting rights. Activists and government officials who favor the change have to push harder on an issue that the nation's Islamist majority views as a threat to traditional values.</p>

        <p>Kuwait is further along the road toward social liberalism than most of its Persian Gulf neighbors, with a woman at the helm of Kuwait University, a female ambassador and women outnumbering men in public schools. But if Kuwaitis are to achieve any semblance of the country's constitutional guarantee of ''equal rights'' for men and women, full political rights must be granted to women. That would serve as an example for other gulf nations that have yet to give women the right to vote.</p>
        <p>Kuwaiti feminists recently suffered a setback when the constitutional court dismissed cases petitioning for women's voting rights. Activists and government officials who favor the change have to push harder on an issue that the nation's Islamist majority views as a threat to traditional values.</p>
        <p>Kuwait's highest court rejected the cases on procedural grounds. The plaintiffs had challenged the constitutionality of a law that grants the vote only to certain men. The law contradicts the Constitution's guarantee of equal rights for men and women.</p>
        <p>Since the court is unwilling to act, lobbying pressure must be applied to Parliament. Conservative tribal and Islamist legislators worked together last year to overturn a decree by the emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, that would have given women the right to vote and stand for public office. This coalition also narrowly defeated a suffrage bill, 32 to 30. The thin margin can be reversed with energetic campaigning.</p>
        <p>The cause warrants renewed support from the Council of Ministers, the prime minister and the emir. The emir and his cabinet must secure the lead on this issue and take swift steps toward drafting women's rights measures and mobilizing parliamentary acceptance of them. Kuwaiti women deserve the support of their government in their struggle to gain a voice in their nation's politics.</p>
