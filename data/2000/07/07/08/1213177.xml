        <p>Re ''Hubris, but No History,'' by David Hackett Fischer (Op-Ed, July 1):</p>
        <p>The issues of realism and historical accuracy in the new Mel Gibson movie, ''The Patriot,'' are personal ones for me. Two years ago, I completed a script based on the Revolutionary War experiences of Maj. John Andre, the British officer who was hanged for his role in the Benedict Arnold affair. I sent a ''query letter'' to 20 different agents in an effort to sell my idea. I didn't receive a single reply.</p>

        <p>My fear is that with the mixed reviews of ''The Patriot,'' Hollywood will again bury the subject of America's War of Independence for another 20 years. Pity. Not only are there real stories to be told, but one does not need to invent -- they are there for the taking.</p>
