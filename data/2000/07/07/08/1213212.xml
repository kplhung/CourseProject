        <p>Southeast Asia's economies are growing again. Its stock markets are getting smaller.</p>
        <p>If that contrast sounds odd, it is. Last December, economists and analysts predicted that 2000 would be a boom year for Asian stocks and currencies. They said foreign investors, enriched with gains in high-technology stocks, would snap up Indonesian rupiah, Thai baht and Philippine pesos to buy stocks and bet on the region's continued recovery from the financial crisis that began in mid-1997.</p>
        <p>Those forecasts have gone astray. Foreign investors have sold Southeast Asian stocks and currencies for much of the year, helping make several of the region's markets among the worst performing in the world.</p>
        <p>Analysts and fund managers attribute the sell-off to a perception that Southeast Asia, despite an economic rebound, remains a dangerous place to invest because of political instability, corruption and a lack of technological sophistication.</p>
        <p>''No one's looking at fundamentals these days,'' said Rebecca H. Patterson, a currency strategist at J. P. Morgan in Singapore.</p>
        <p>Just how much investment funds from the United States, Europe and Japan have sold is difficult to determine. Securities exchanges in some countries, notably Singapore, do not release figures on foreign trading.</p>
        <p>Lipper Analytical Services in New York says that so for this year at least $230 million had been pulled out of United States funds that make investments in Asian markets other than Japan's. But that figure would tend to understate the situation, because it includes funds investing in popular markets like South Korea, Taiwan, China and Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>Figures from individual exchanges indicate where withdrawals and investment losses are worst. The Philippine Stock Exchange reports that foreigners have sold roughly $172 million more than they have bought so far this year. In Thailand, foreigners have sold nearly $700 million more in Thai stocks than they have bought. In Indonesia, foreigners had a $20 million net withdrawal in the first five months of the year.</p>
        <p>Some of the benchmark stock indexes in the region have dropped 25 percent or more, making the 7.5 percent year-to-date decline of the Dow industrial average look modest. The exchange values of most Southeast Asian currencies have also fallen sharply.</p>
        <p>Indonesia's benchmark stock index is down 25 percent. Combined with a 31 percent currency-rate decline, Indonesian stocks have lost nearly 56 percent of their value in dollar terms this year.</p>
        <p>''We are concerned that this may balloon into another crisis,'' said Steven Lim, who manages $500 million in investments in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia for Daiwa International, the Japanese investment bank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lim cites the problems of an Indonesian fishing company, Daya Guna Samudera, to indicate how the investment statistics apply in real terms.</p>
        <p>Daya Guna has exclusive licenses to catch and export fish and shrimp from Indonesia's teeming eastern seas. With its costs in Indonesian rupiah and its revenue in dollars, investing in Daya Guna seemed like an obvious opportunity last year.</p>
        <p>But in December, the company informed investors that its catch had fallen 15 percent from the previous year. A third of its crew members, it said, had deserted to escape Muslim-Christian clashes in the eastern islands, leaving many new fishing vessels idle and the company in difficulty with creditors.</p>
        <p>Seen more broadly, missing fishermen are the least of problems Indonesia is having with foreign investors now. Muslim rebels in the West, secessionists in the east and sectarian clashes on the islands in between have crippled confidence. Skirmishing between President Abdurrahman Wahid, his central bank chief and his cabinet have left the economy rudderless.</p>
        <p>Somewhat similar troubles are souring investor sentiment elsewhere in the region. In the Philippines, insurgents in two separate Muslim rebellions have brought bombings to the capital and have kept 20 scuba divers hostage on a jungle island for nearly two months -- situations that do little to entice foreign capital. Nor has an insider-trading scandal involving a friend of President Joseph Estrada helped.</p>
        <p>By comparison, Thailand is tamer. But a two-year court battle between the founder of a local plastics maker and its bankers has underlined the troubles still faced by Thai banks as they try to recover the 40 percent of their loans that borrowers cannot or will not repay. Banks make up roughly a quarter of the benchmark stock index, leading Peggy Creveling, who heads Salomon Smith Barney's research in Thailand, to ask, ''how can the market go up?''</p>
        <p>Malaysian stocks, which had been rising this year in anticipation of their inclusion again in global market indexes, have lately succumbed to the exodus of foreign capital.</p>
        <p>And Singapore, famously stable and in the midst of an economic liberalization campaign, is suffering the effects of living in a tough neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''I don't get it,'' said Chia Yeng Boo, 53, a Singaporean investor, as he watched local stock prices dwindle on a television screen. ''The economy keeps getting better, but the stocks keep going down.''</p>
        <p>Local investors expecting a flood of foreign funds this year helped fuel a powerful rally late in 1999, particularly in electronics and telecommunications stocks. Their logic: when Nasdaq's bulls came to bank on a Southeast Asian recovery, they would look for anything remotely related to the Internet.</p>
        <p>But smaller markets in the region lacked sufficient Internet appeal for foreign investors. There were just not enough high-end exports, dot-com stock offerings or flashy Internet market statistics, analysts say, to match markets in Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei and Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq rout in technology shares in April made things even worse. Investors, rather than seizing an opportunity to jump into fundamental economic stories like Southeast Asia's, simply lost their appetite for any risk.</p>
