        <p>Msgr. Charles E. Diviney, a former vicar-general of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, died June 28 at a retirement home in Queens Village. He was 93.</p>
        <p>He was the second oldest priest in the diocese, which he had served since his ordination in 1931. He also reviewed books for The Tablet, the diocesan weekly.</p>
        <p>Monsignor Diviney was vicar-general of the diocese, which includes Queens, from 1965 to 1978. He administered the diocese for two months in 1968, from July, when Archbishop Bryan J. McEntegart retired, until September, when Bishop Francis J. Mugavero was consecrated.</p>
        <p>The monsignor was born in Long Island City, Queens. He attended Fordham University and studied for the priesthood at St. John's Seminary in Brooklyn. He taught at St. Joseph's College in Brooklyn from 1934 to 1959. Then he was the parish priest of St. Charles Borromeo Church in Brooklyn until 1978 and was vicar-general for much of that time.</p>
