        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Sharon White Taylor calls for the ''cell phone police'' to enforce simple courtesy (Op-Ed, July 5), but she misses a more practical solution. If people decide to treat the entire world as their phone booth, it is only appropriate that they realize that other people are in it, too. And if they choose to forgo their privacy, it is only sensible for me to assume they have decided to include me in their conversation.</p>
        <p>So I have no qualms about taking them up on the offer and adding helpful comments. If it's clear there's a boyfriend problem, or a lawyer problem, well, I've had boyfriend problems and lawyer problems.</p>

        <p>I've found that a word or two of advice interjected in a voice loud enough so that the person on the other end can benefit, while not often taken kindly, at least helps solve any problem the three of us are having at the moment.</p>
