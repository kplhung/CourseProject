        <p>He has taken a licking from a cow focused on his khakis and a licking from the press focused on a fund-raising letter attacking his opponent. In one day he was told by a beer-clutching middle-aged man to ''kill'' his opponent and by an elderly woman that his position generally favoring abortion rights amounts to murder. He has heard people greet him as Rick while others stood back, asking who he was.</p>
        <p>If Representative Rick A. Lazio's 1,200-mile tour across the state this past week seemed up and down, it apparently never fazed him. Standing in a blue open-collar shirt with khakis still pocked from his encounter with a calf on a farm outside Buffalo, Mr. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, was naturally upbeat yesterday as his tour ended.</p>
        <p>''I got a chance to talk about some of the issues I've been working on in Washington,'' Mr. Lazio said before heading on to a factory outside Rochester and his final stop at a Bronx hospital.</p>
        <p>At a later briefing, he turned unusually introspective as he spoke of responding to issues of the day. He said the experience had reconfirmed his goal ''to not let myself get too defensive when somebody is saying something that bothers me, to try and take a deep breath and answer questions.''</p>
        <p>Later, while traveling on a plane from Rochester to New York City, he revealed some things he has missed because of the campaign, such as a Bible study group he attends with a group of fellow congressmen. He struggled to name the last movie he had seen, relying on his wife, Patricia, to remind him it was ''Pokemon,'' and said he had not read a book in months. The last one was ''Tuesdays With Morrie.''</p>
        <p>Tomorrow's TV Spots</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio spoke on a variety of topics in his five-day tour -- child care, housing for the elderly, support for farmers, the desire to lower taxes, all things that he said he supported through legislation in the House. But as on his first bus tour after winning the nomination on May 30, pictures counted, too, particularly as a camera crew shot material over three days for future commercials.</p>
        <p>That may explain the rocketing streamers fired off at two stops, at rallies of fewer than 75 people in otherwise deserted parks. Or the large American flag that dwarfed Mr. Lazio at a Schenectady rally. Or why Michael Murphy, his chief strategist, sat on the bumper of a red pickup truck in the town of Argyle's Independence Day parade, directing Mr. Lazio, marching right behind.</p>
        <p>On a dairy farm in Burke, a few miles from Canada, Mr. Lazio changed from a dress shirt to a blue-and-white checkered shirt before sitting among bales of hay. With the camera on, he showed concern as farmers talked about hard times. Later, his aides asked reporters to step out of sight while the Lazios and their two young daughters walked off into a gloriously green field with cows, for more filming.</p>
        <p>No word yet on when the commercials will be broadcast.</p>
        <p>A Family Business</p>
        <p>In Saratoga Springs, they brandished American flags from a small window on the bus Mr. Lazio used for his swing across the state. In Yonkers, they hurled hats and T-shirts at eager supporters. And as he marched in an Independence Day parade in Lake Placid, they got on the microphone in the bus and called out, ''Vote for my dad, he's great!''</p>
        <p>A little over a week after Chelsea Clinton coyly signaled she would be around a little more, now that her mother, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is running for Senate, here come Molly and Kelsey Lazio.</p>
        <p>Molly, 8, and Kelsey, 6, have not attracted the attention given to Ms. Clinton, who was surrounded by reporters at a recent City Hall news conference. But at least on this trip, they have been front and center much of the time, even called to the podium by Mr. Lazio at some events.</p>
        <p>They have traveled with their father before but stayed largely in the background or out of sight. This time they scampered about, amusing onlookers with their antics, such as showing off operating room garb while Dad toured Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center yesterday.</p>
        <p>Having the family around -- Mrs. Lazio is frequently by his side at campaign events -- helps bolster the mainstream, family-man image Mr. Lazio is striving to project. Mr. Lazio says the family also helps relieve the stress of campaigning.</p>
        <p>But after summer vacation is over, he does not expect to bring the girls on the campaign trail too often.  ''We have to make sure they do their homework,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Getting the Name Out</p>
        <p>As much as it had to do with talking over issues, Mr. Lazio's tour was about getting his name and face out more -- particularly important for a relatively unknown Long Island congressman in a contest with the first lady of the United States. And on this, his score was mixed.</p>
        <p>He said he sensed more people recognized him -- even during the few times he greeted people outside of Republican strongholds or staged rallies, and even if their opinion had not jelled. But often as he passed, people asked one another who he was.</p>
        <p>In a Yonkers diner early in the trip, a waitress dutifully served him  and his family. When she was asked her opinion of the congressman, she replied, ''What's his name again?''</p>
