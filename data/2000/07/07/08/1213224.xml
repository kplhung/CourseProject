        <p>After a disastrous drop in jobs in May, American companies added modestly to their payrolls in June, creating 206,000 new jobs, the Labor Department reported yesterday, reinforcing the impression that the economy is slowing.</p>
        <p>Job creation in the private sector has now fallen from an average of 244,000 a month in the first quarter to only 110,000 a month from April through June. But if companies are reluctant to hire, they are still hiring in sufficient numbers to keep the unemployment rate at only 4 percent last month, down from 4.1 percent in May -- the lowest levels since the late 1960's.</p>
        <p>''Economic growth is slowing, but gently, so far,'' said James Glassman, a senior economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>
        <p>The coming and going of thousands of census takers skewed the overall job numbers in both May and June. The total number of jobs created in June -- covering government employees as well as the private sector -- was only 11,000. That was mainly because 190,000 census takers, having finished their work, left the Census Bureau's payroll.</p>
        <p>In May, the hiring of 356,000 census takers swelled the total job count to 171,000. Without them, private-sector employment fell by 165,000, the largest drop in eight years and the first of any size since the economy began to soar in the mid-1990's. The May loss had been estimated as 116,000 but was revised yesterday to 165,000.</p>
        <p>''You still have about 428,000 temporary census takers out there, and they will come off the payroll, probably in July and August,'' said Thomas Nardone, chief of the division that prepares the employment data at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration acknowledged that the new job report added to the evidence that the economy is slowing. ''We do see signs of moderation,'' Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said, ''but the economy is still steady and stable and strong.''</p>
        <p>Stock prices soared yesterday in response to the new evidence of slowing, the expectation being that the Federal Reserve will be less likely to raise interest rates at its next policy meeting, on Aug. 22. Rising rates encourage investors to switch their money out of stocks and into interest-bearing investments.</p>
        <p>''Another weak month would kill an August rate hike,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics, advised his clients yesterday, referring to the June job report.</p>
        <p>But some Wall Street economists argue that although job creation may be slowing, inflation remains an issue, even in a weakening economy, and the Fed will have to deal with it. Labor shortages and competition for workers, this argument goes, must eventually force up wages and then prices, although that has not happened yet to a significant degree.</p>
        <p>''The market is discounting any further Fed rate increases, which I think is a mistake,'' said Peter Hooper, chief domestic economist of Deutsche Bank North America. Mortgage rates and other consumer rates, he argued, are not yet high enough to dampen demand sufficiently to discourage price increases.</p>
        <p>Others pointed to wages. Average hourly earnings for production workers, representing about 75 percent of the 131.6 million people in the work force, rose by 5 cents in June, to $13.71, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday. The increase in May was only 2 cents.</p>
        <p>When viewed over 12 months, the rate of increase is a mild 3.6 percent. But since January the average hourly pay for production workers turns out to have risen at an accelerated 4 percent annual rate.</p>
        <p>''The hourly wage increase was not comforting at all,'' said Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. But the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, saw the glass as half full. It noted that recent improvements in productivity had more than paid for the hourly wage increase. The productivity growth rate measures an average worker's output during each hour on the job. The higher the output, the more revenue the worker brings in for his employer to pay for wage increases without raising prices.</p>
        <p>''The wage path implies an underlying rate of inflation of only about 1 percent a year,'' Jerry Jasinowski, president of the manufacturers' group, said in a statement. The manufacturers have been arguing against any further rate increases by the Fed, insisting that more will slow the economy too much.</p>
        <p>The Fed has raised rates six times since June 1999, for a total of 1.75 percentage points, and the effect on demand helps to explain why the economy has begun to slow down, economists say. Another reason cited is gasoline price increases, which divert family income from other spending. Still another is heavy buying of homes, cars, appliances, furniture -- to the point that demand is sated.</p>
        <p>The stock market wealth effect no longer has its old kick, others argue. With stock prices going sideways in recent months, or falling in the high-technology sector, consumers no longer feel as confident about their wealth and limit their spending. And a strong dollar is restricting exports, particularly manufactured exports.</p>
        <p>Most job growth in June was in the service sector, particularly business services, which added 54,000 jobs, and in retailing, which added 49,000 jobs, mostly at restaurants. Consultants led the growth in business services, with healthy increases also in temporary help, health services, engineering and hotels.</p>
        <p>Employment in the financial sector seemed to show the effects of the slowing economy and higher rates. Jobs in this sector fell by 6,000 last month and 20,000 so far this year, with cutbacks in commercial and mortgage banking, insurance and real estate.</p>
        <p>Construction employment, which has fluctuated sharply with the weather, grew by 3,000 jobs in June, raising the average monthly gain to 20,000 this year, down from 25,000 a month for 1999.</p>
        <p>Still, the June figures gave evidence of the tight labor market. The unemployment rate for women who support families fell in June, as it did for teenagers and people with a high school education or less. The number of people holding part-time jobs because they could not get full-time work also fell.</p>
        <p>Among blacks and Hispanic people, however, the unemployment rate, which jumped in May, did not fall back in June. And the percentage of people who quit a job confident that they can get another in a strong economy fell by 1.1 points in June, to 12.1 percent, its lowest level in months.</p>
