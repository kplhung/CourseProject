        <p>On the street here these days you hear French, Swedish, Russian, Japanese and at least half a dozen other foreign tongues. It is not tourists who give the city this cosmopolitan air, but business executives slinging around expressions like informationsteknologi (Swedish for information technology) and keizai kaihatsu (Japanese for economic development).</p>
        <p>Not too bad for a city that 80 years ago, under the alias Zenith, was branded as hopelessly small-minded and provincial by Sinclair Lewis in his novel ''Babbitt.''</p>
        <p>Duluth is still no New York or Los Angeles, of course. Or even a place like Rochester, Minn., home of the Mayo Clinic. But it has focused more on the wider world not just because of its shipping trade through the Great Lakes but also because of its sister-city program -- the nonprofit city-to-city network inspired by President Dwight D. Eisenhower's suggestion in 1956 that citizen diplomacy might reduce the chance of future world conflict.</p>
        <p>The program, which really took off around the country in the 1970's and 80's, began largely with international cultural exchanges, and support for health and education. Now, the emphasis is changing to a more bottom-line approach.</p>
        <p>''There is a new interest in business and economic development,'' said Lewis F. Harwood, a spokesman for Sister Cities International, the United States service association based in Washington that administers the program.</p>
        <p>''You could see it last April at an international conference in Merida, Mexico, where representatives from about 20 American cities came looking for international business links and trade opportunities with other municipalities throughout the Americas,'' Mr. Harwood said. ''We think they were quite successful at making these connections.''</p>
        <p>Economic development has long been pursued at the national level by the Commerce Department, Mr. Harwood acknowledged. And states and large municipalities, which can afford offices of economic development and send trade missions around the world, have long been doing business internationally. Now, however, more and more cities are reaching out internationally through city-to-city relationships. ''It's definitely a trend,'' Mr. Harwood said.</p>
        <p>To be sure, some people think the program is a waste of time and money. In the early 1990's, for example, an editorial writer in Duluth wondered aloud what the city's mayor was doing in Japan on what he called a sister city ''junket'' when he ought to be at home in Minnesota minding the store. But despite such sniping, this city and many others are hoping to use the program more actively to pursue development projects in a globalizing economy.</p>
        <p>And in the case of Duluth that switch in emphasis to international business seems to have been, at least in part, a recognition of problems in the local economy. Between 1980 and 1990, for example, the Duluth-Superior, Wis., region lost more than 26,000 people, adding to the incentive of local officials to take advantage of every program they could.</p>
        <p>By the end of 1999, about 1,280 American cities were engaged in the sister city program, some more widely than others. Seattle, for example, has 20 sister cities around the world, from Christchurch, New Zealand, to Haiphong, Vietnam. New York City has six, including Madrid and Cairo.</p>
        <p>Duluth now has four: Thunder Bay, Ontario; Ohara, Japan; Petrozavodsk, Russia; and Vaxjo, Sweden. These partnerships have generated more than $10 million in direct revenue for the city over the last few years, according to Duluth's mayor, Gary L. Doty.</p>
        <p>More important, programs that  started out as cultural ties have become in many cases profit-centered enterprises. The Duluth-Vaxjo link, for example, resulted in an ambitious project that its investors, who anted up $24 million, hope will make Duluth a major port city for information technology as it has long been for timber, grain and iron ore.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Mayor Doty led a delegation to Vaxjo seeking to expand cultural exchanges based on the Swedish heritage of a large segment of the city's population. But it was something they stumbled on in the nearby town of Ronneby that provided the big inspiration. For a decade, the city of Ronneby had been host to a technology campus that brought together under one roof about 100 high-technology businesses, branches of academic institutions, professors working as research and development consultants, and students taking classes and serving internships. Such interactions at the campus, Soft Center Ronneby, provide, among other things, a sorely needed supply of well-trained information-technology workers.</p>
        <p>''This is what we should be doing,'' Mayor Doty exclaimed.</p>
        <p>Michael J. McNamara, who had joined the delegation as a representative of the Duluth Chamber of Commerce, got the message, too. ''It's a school-to-work model for the information-technology industry,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In short order, a four-story technology campus rose in downtown Duluth, financed by city, state and private money. It is one of a growing number of such centers throughout the world based on the Ronneby model.</p>
        <p>Christened Soft Center Duluth, the enterprise held an open house for prospective tenants last month. Visitors came from England, Scotland, France, Norway, West Africa, South Africa, Canada and many parts of the United States. The building is now 30 percent occupied, by tenants including academic institutions, high-technology concerns and a big-name investment bank.</p>
        <p>''The center is attracting the kind of tenants they want at a somewhat slower rate than anticipated,'' said Kjell Knudsen, dean of the School of Business and Economics at the University of Minnesota-Duluth, who once served as an unpaid board member of the Soft Center. ''But the prospect is that it will succeed.''</p>
        <p>Among those working at the video terminals in the new building recently was Joe Allert, 19, a sophomore majoring in business at the Soft Center branch of the University of Minnesota-Duluth.</p>
        <p>''I came here because I like the idea of having educational institutions in the same building as employers and even Salomon Smith Barney and other business,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Not all of Duluth's sister-city partnerships are focused on hard-headed business projects. The relationship with Petrozavodsk is, thus far, purely philanthropic, recently involving an effort to raise funds for clothing and supplies for children in orphanages. And the link with Thunder Bay, only a few hours away by car, is largely cultural. But another tie that may result in a business deal is Duluth's relationship with Ohara, which set the stage for all four of Duluth's sister-city partnerships. This tie began during the United States occupation of Japan.</p>
        <p>One night, a gang of sailors from the heavy cruiser Duluth returned from shore leave with a 750-pound, medieval temple gong in tow. The bronze gong, covered with ancient inscriptions and fanciful dragons, is recognized in Japan as a national treasure.</p>
        <p>The captain considered the gong a legitimate war trophy and arranged to have it delivered to the ship's namesake: the city of Duluth. For the next decade, the gong was on display first in City Hall and then in Duluth's Enger Park.</p>
        <p>In 1951, a visiting Japanese college professor happened to see the gong. He explained to Duluth's mayor how important it was to Japan, and asked to have it returned.</p>
        <p>A lengthy correspondence followed, and eventually the gong was sent back to Ohara -- a fishing village 90 miles southeast of Tokyo from which it had been taken. In gratitude, the Japanese delivered a full-scale replica of the gong for display in Enger Park.</p>
        <p>In 1990, Duluth and Ohara became sister cities. And last month, a group of 15 visiting Japanese dignitaries and several dozen Duluthians held a ceremony in Enger Park to rededicate the replica as a symbol of peace and mutual understanding.</p>
        <p>A soprano sang the Japanese national anthem and then the American. Next, Mayor Doty and Soichiro Oya, a petroleum entrepreneur who led the Japanese sister-city delegation, jointly clanged the gong with a huge striker in the name of everlasting peace.</p>
        <p>After the ceremony, the conversation turned to golf.</p>
        <p>While golf is an expensive sport in Japan, where the links are crowded and reservations hard to come by, Duluth, by contrast, is a golfer's paradise, ranked by Golf Digest as the best of America's 309 small cities for access to good, affordable links.</p>
        <p>So why not market golfing vacations in Duluth for Japanese tourists? Carl Seehus, Duluth's director of parks and recreation and a former director of the city's sister-city program, was talking up the idea. And Mr. Oya, an avid golfer, agreed.</p>
        <p>''The last decade was for cultural exchanges,'' Mr. Oya added. ''The next decade will be for business.''</p>
