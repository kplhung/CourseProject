        <p>An average player who sits behind a champion, hoping to learn something, has no idea of the subtleties that the expert considers. He or she would do better to sit in front of a computer and study ''Play Bridge With Larry Cohen, Day 2.'' More information is at 800-713-9935.</p>
        <p>This CD-ROM costs $33.95, including shipping and handling. Cohen, a world-class player who will represent the United States in the world championships in the Netherlands in August, takes his readers, step by step, through the 52 deals of the 1999 Life Master Pairs semifinal. He asks questions, provides a chance to answer and explains his reasoning.</p>
        <p>Many would think that the diagramed deal is of no interest, but in a matchpoint event there are always things to think about. South's overcall of one spade is normal, and the author explains why both a cautious pass and an eccentric Michaels Cue Bid of two diamonds to show the major suits should be rejected.</p>
        <p>After a diamond lead, South is in  danger of losing two tricks in each minor suit and one in each major, for down one. But in that case, three clubs will make for the opponents.</p>
        <p>On the first trick, the obvious play of a low diamond from dummy is not the best. The diamond jack from dummy is better, for if it loses to the ace, as it does, East may be tempted to return the suit in the belief that his partner has the queen-ten.</p>
        <p>But East shifts to clubs, and after three rounds of the suit, South ruffs.  Declarer now reviews what he knows. West has produced six points in clubs and must have the diamond queen. Therefore he cannot have four or more hearts, for he would have made a negative double.</p>
        <p>This suggests that the spades are splitting normally, so South cashes the ace and king. It is now a virtual certainty that the heart king is with East, who opened the bidding. South takes the doomed finesse, and when it loses, claims his contract, conceding a trick to the spade ten.</p>
        <p>South is happy. Cohen's postmortem deals with the defenders. Should they have done better in the auction?</p>
        <p>When the two-spade bid was passed around to him, West should have used the Law of Total Tricks. West could assume his opponents had at least an eight-card fit. East surely had at most two spades and at most four hearts, so he had at least seven cards in the minor suits.</p>
        <p>A two-no-trump bid by West would be unusual, asking East to pick a minor. East has the minimum number of diamonds, given that he has bid the suit. He tries three clubs, locating a 3-5 fit, which is one down for a loss of 100 unless North-South gamble wildly with a penalty double.</p>
        <p>Two spades was 67 percent of the match points. Gaining 100 for beating three clubs one trick would have been 37 percent. Little things mean a lot in match point games.</p>
