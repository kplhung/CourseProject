        <p>Really? Not like any of the schools across the country where children have been killed in the last few years?</p>
        <p>If there is one thing we should have learned from the Littleton tragedy, it is that violence is not the exclusive property of places like Harlem. It can strike peaceful white suburbs as well. Isn't now the time for solutions, not stereotypes?</p>
