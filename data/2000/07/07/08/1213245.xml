        <p>Sheriff Don Eslinger of Seminole County said today that the 19-year-old son of the basketball legend Julius Erving, Cory Erving, whose body was found in his submerged car on Thursday, did not commit suicide.</p>
        <p>There were no obvious signs of trauma on the body, Sheriff Eslinger said, but he declined to dismiss the possibility of foul play.</p>
        <p>''The cause and manner of death have not been determined, pending further tests,'' the sheriff said.</p>
        <p>An autopsy had ruled out suicide, he said, but a toxicology report was not ready. Cory Erving had a history of drug problems and had completed five rehabilitation programs.</p>
        <p>Seminole County investigators found Mr. Erving's car in a pond about a half-mile from his family's residence in the affluent Alaqua Lakes neighborhood. They had dragged 36 bodies of water in three counties before finding the car, a 1999 Volkswagen Passat, about 20 yards from shore.</p>
        <p>The windows were up, and the air bags had not been deployed. Mr. Erving was not wearing a seat belt.</p>
        <p>''We have an obligation to provide information to the family and find some resolution,'' Sheriff Eslinger said. ''We don't want to speculate or draw false conclusions.''</p>
        <p>The Sheriff's Department plans to enlist help from the Florida Highway Patrol in reconstructing the scene and mechanically inspecting of the car, a department spokesman, Steve Olson, said.</p>
        <p>The sheriff said Mr. Erving was in the same clothing he was wearing on May 28, when he left home to go to a nearby bakery to pick up bread for a party. He had called his father to say he would be home in 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>That was the last communication his family had with him.</p>
        <p>Pat Williams, the president of the Orlando Magic basketball team who was instrumental in hiring Julius Erving to work for the team three years ago, talked to the older Mr. Erving today and characterized him as coping with the reality of losing a son.</p>
        <p>''He has some closure,'' Mr. Williams said. ''He used that word to me several times. I think the unknown was what was so hard for them.''</p>
        <p>Julius Erving, who achieved his basketball fame with the Philadelphia 76ers, issued a statement that said, in part, ''We have learned a lot from this tragedy and we will be a stronger family as a result. The Erving family will go forward from here. We have no other choice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams said he envisioned the father becoming a spokesman for the campaign against drugs.</p>
        <p>''I've known Julius for a long time,'' said Mr. Williams, who was a 76ers executive when Mr. Erving played there. ''He didn't tell me this, but I just believe he will not want his son's life to have ended in vain. I see him using what happened in a positive way. I see him speaking out against drugs.''</p>
        <p>Cory Erving had been missing for 16 days when his family made his disappearance public. His father at first offered a $25,000 reward for information about his whereabouts. Three days later he raised the reward to $50,000. That produced hundreds of phone calls to a special number, but no significant leads.</p>
        <p>Cory Erving began using drugs at age 14, his father said, after bad grades eliminated his chance of being a schoolboy athlete. He operated between two worlds, immersing himself in drug culture on Orlando's streets but returning to a million-dollar home.</p>
        <p>His father noted that in recent years Mr. Erving seemed to become more determined to straighten out his life. Embarrassed early in his school years by a learning disability, he eventually received his high school equivalency diploma at Seminole Community College.</p>
