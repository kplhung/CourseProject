        <p>Missile Defense Test Fails  In a major setback for the Clinton Administration's plan to build a  missile shield to protect American soil from enemy attack, a missile fired from the Marshall Islands in the Pacific failed to hit a mock warhead launched 4,300 miles away in California.</p>

        <p>Criticism of Rwanda Inaction  The United States and other nations and institutions that failed to prevent or stop the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 should pay a ''significant level of reparations,'' an independent panel said. The panel also faulted France and Belgium, as well as the United Nations and the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches.</p>

        <p>World Bank Plan Blocked  The World Bank's board, under heavy pressure from the United States, overruled the bank leadership and denied financing for a sensitive Chinese antipoverty proposal that set off a North-South struggle over aid. The $160 million plan divided leading borrowers from rich nations, including the United States.</p>

        <p>Bosnia Rejects U.S. Report  The Bosnian government bridled at a report to the United States Congress that said crime and corruption were blocking the success of the Dayton peace accord. Bosnian officials insisted that the government itself was pursuing investigations of local government corruption and tackling smuggling.</p>

        <p>Swiss Find Israeli Guilty  Switzerland's top court found an Israeli spy guilty of espionage and gave him a one-year suspended sentence for his part in a botched 1998 wiretap effort. The court also barred him from Switzerland for five years. The sentence means that he will not serve any time in jail and can return to Israel, an outcome welcomed in a statement issued by Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office in Jerusalem.</p>

        <p>Senior Bush Predicts History Will Favor His Son  Former President George Bush, in a rare face-to-face interview about his son's presidential campaign, said Gov. George W. Bush would emerge victorious in November largely because American voters periodically craved change, and because President Clinton's conduct in office had sharpened that appetite.</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore, a longtime supporter of capital punishment, said that he backed the Clinton administration's decision to postpone the first federal execution in nearly 40 years but that he did not support a nationwide death-penalty moratorium.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>The Democrats released a draft of their party platform that strongly articulates the centrist ''new Democratic'' views of Vice President Gore, but also offers concessions to liberals on several major issues, including trade, the death penalty and gay rights.</p>

        <p>Accused General to Retire  The two-star general accused of sexually harassing the Army's highest-ranking woman has requested early retirement after military investigators endorsed the charges against him, officials said. The accused officer, Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith, has denied any wrongdoing.</p>

        <p>Churches Closer to Alliance  The Episcopal Church and the nation's largest Lutheran denomination, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, moved closer to creating a formal alliance in which they would recognize each other's traditions and share resources.</p>

        <p>Ominous Start for Drug Plan  Nevada has adopted a prescription drug program for the elderly very similar to one approved last month by the United States House of Representatives, but it is off to a rocky start. Insurers have spurned Nevada's invitation to provide coverage, saying the risks and the costs are too high and the subsidies offered by the state are too low.</p>

        <p>Man Fatally Shot by Officers  Two off-duty police officers fatally shot a man who began punching them after a traffic altercation on the Grand Central Parkway in Queens, the police said. Although police officials did not explicitly defend the shooting, they suggested that it was justified, saying that the man relentlessly punched the officers and grabbed at one of their guns.</p>

        <p>Emissions Gains, at a Cost  New Jersey officials say that when the state's automobile inspection system completes its switch to a tougher emissions test on Aug. 1, they will have achieved a smoothly operating program that results in cleaner air. But the company that runs the system says that more inspection lanes will be needed, at a cost of millions of dollars.</p>

        <p>Ballplayer's Grandson Charged  The grandson of Gil Hodges, the first baseman for the postwar Brooklyn Dodgers, was charged with manslaughter after he accidentally killed the brother of a man believed to be a member of the Lucchese crime family, the police said. The grandson is also named Gil Hodges.</p>

        <p>China Sides With Linux  The Chinese government, concerned that the country is growing overly dependent on Microsoft's Windows operating system, is taking its case against Microsoft to the marketplace. The government is backing the Linux operating system, which was created by a Finnish university student in 1991 and is distributed free to anyone.</p>

        <p>Modest Growth in New Jobs  American companies added modestly to their payrolls in June, creating 206,000 new jobs, the Labor Department reported, reinforcing the impression that the economy is slowing. The unemployment rate was 4 percent in June, down from 4.1 percent in May.</p>
        <p>C1</p>
        <p>Both stocks and bonds rallied after the June employment report brought investors the news of slower growth and the hope that the Federal Reserve might now refrain from another increase in interest rates next month.</p>
