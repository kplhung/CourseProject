        <p>HEJDUK-John. In deep sorrow, we join Gloria and the Hejduk family in mourning the loss of John, one of the most esteemed graduates of Cooper Union. A giant of a man in many respects, he was a noted architect of the world, a dedicated educator, artist, visionary, writer and poet, bringing glory to his alma mater. John was the recipient of the college's Presidential Citation, the Augustus Saint Gaudens Award for his professional achievement and the first awardee of the Artists of the City medal. He touched the lives of many alumni as our mentor, teacher and dear friend. Marilyn Hoffner President The Cooper Union Alumni Association</p>
