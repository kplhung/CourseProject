        <p>A longstanding paternity suit against Albert J. Pirro Jr., the husband of the Westchester County district attorney, was settled on Thursday in Indiana, two weeks after Mr. Pirro's conviction for tax fraud.</p>
        <p>The paternity suit, filed by the mother of a teenage girl, figured during Mr. Pirro's tax-fraud trial: prosecutors said that he claimed money spent in fighting the suit as a business expense on his tax returns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pirro, a prominent Republican businessman who is married to District Attorney Jeanine F. Pirro, was convicted by a federal jury of improperly deducting $1.2 million in personal expenses as business write-offs.</p>
        <p>Last June, DNA testing indicated that Mr. Pirro, 52, was the father of a teenage girl whose mother, Jessica Marciano of Indiana, sued him for child support.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Mr. Pirro in Indiana did not return a phone message left yesterday. Mr. Pirro's spokeswoman, Colleen Roche, confirmed that a settlement had been reached, but said the court ruling kept her from commenting or providing details.</p>
        <p>During the tax-fraud trial, several private investigators testified that Mr. Pirro had hired them to help him fight the suit and had paid them from one or more companies he owned.</p>
        <p>A lawyer and Pirro family friend who once employed Ms. Marciano also testified that Mr. Pirro had paid him to find hospital and divorce records on her.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said that these fees were included in Mr. Pirro's tax deductions, which also included expenses for sports cars, cruise tickets and furniture for the Pirros' home in Harrison, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marciano, who has married and now goes by the name Lynne Lichtefeld, did not attend the tax-fraud trial, which ended on June 22. She had been arrested on May 30 at Newark International Airport on a warrant for violation of probation in Florida related to a 1992 grand-theft conviction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pirro was convicted along with his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro, on tax charges in United States District Court in Westchester. Mr. Pirro is appealing the conviction.</p>
