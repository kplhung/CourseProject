        <p>Anthony Lewis Op-Ed column urges Ralph Nader not to run for president as Green Party candidate, rejecting his claim that the two major parties are indistinguishable and assailing the major issue he appears to be running on: trade protectionism (M)</p>

        <p>Nader for president! You say you are serious this time, running as the candidate of the Green Party, and you deride those who say you should get out of Al Gore's way. Fair enough. Third parties are an honorable, if frustrating, American tradition.</p>
        <p>What is puzzling to some of your old admirers is what you stand for. You say the two major parties are practically Tweedledum and Tweedledee -- there are ''few major differences'' between them. Sure, they are both awash in campaign money that keeps them close to business. But no major differences? Are you serious?</p>

        <p>Nader for president! You say you are serious this time, running as the candidate of the Green Party, and you deride those who say you should get out of Al Gore's way. Fair enough. Third parties are an honorable, if frustrating, American tradition.</p>
        <p>What is puzzling to some of your old admirers is what you stand for. You say the two major parties are practically Tweedledum and Tweedledee -- there are ''few major differences'' between them. Sure, they are both awash in campaign money that keeps them close to business. But no major differences? Are you serious?</p>
        <p>Take one of your concerns, the environment. When Newt Gingrich &amp; Co. took control of the House, Republicans tried to gut the country's environmental protection laws. They were stopped by President Clinton's skillful use of the veto and veto threats. A Republican from Texas, where environmental regulation is in the hands of the polluters, is not likely to be that kind of president.</p>
        <p>Or take law. You and I first met in law school. You have used the legal process well, and I believe you must still have a deep concern for law and the courts.</p>
        <p>The prospective Republican candidate has spoken admiringly of the judicial record of Justice Clarence Thomas. The Democrat would almost certainly make appointments to the Supreme Court on the model of President Clinton's moderate-liberal choices, Justices Ruth Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. No major difference?</p>
        <p>It is surprising that you pay little or no attention to one area where there is in fact little difference between President Clinton and the Republican Congress -- and the records of both are abysmal. That is civil liberties.</p>
        <p>Federal habeas corpus, a fundamental safeguard of freedom, was ravaged by legislation signed without objection by President Clinton. The Republican Congress cut off funds for a handful of resource centers that provided lawyers for prisoners on death row, many of whom had been represented by incompetent counsel.</p>
        <p>The Counter-Terrorism Act, drafted by the Clinton administration, imported into our law the loathsome practice of trials on secret evidence. The Immigration Act of 1996 compelled the deportation of people who had committed trivial crimes years before the act was passed.</p>
        <p>By attacking those affronts to due process and American decency, a third-party candidate could have a real impact. He could shake the major parties' indifference and touch the country's conscience. Don't you care?</p>
        <p>What you mainly seem to care about these days is free trade. You are against it -- or say you want it with so many ifs and buts that it amounts to the same thing. You and your organization, Public Citizen, led the way to the Seattle protests against the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>You talk about the importance of seeing that other countries have laws like ours to protect fair labor standards, the consumer, pure food and the environment. Those are fine ideals. But the effect of insisting that other countries meet our standards before we trade with them would be, as you must know, devastating.</p>
        <p>What South Africans need is jobs; about a third of them are unemployed. The same is true in most of the developing world. Yes, we should worry about underpaid child workers in Asia producing goods for the American market. But efforts that focus attention on such cruelties have been quite effective. To use, instead, the blunderbuss of stopping or handicapping trade would make life harsher for all.</p>
        <p>Free trade benefits Americans enormously, too. Your great early achievement was to bring General Motors to heel. But what really forced reform on G.M., and gave us all better cars, was competition from Japanese and other imports.</p>
        <p>Your protectionist stance has put you in bed with some of the most reactionary forces in this country. You are a twin of Pat Buchanan on the issue. The New Republic reported that Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch got money from Roger Milliken, the far-right South Carolina textile magnate who has bankrolled the conservative cause from Barry Goldwater on.</p>
        <p>Protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the world's poor even more miserable. It is a strange platform for the Ralph Nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected.</p>
