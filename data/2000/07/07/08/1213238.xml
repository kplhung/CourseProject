        <p>With the course there for the taking, Brian Henninger took full advantage.</p>
        <p>Both Henninger and Stephen Ames tied the course record today at Cog Hill Golf and Country Club, shooting nine-under-par 63's that continued a two-day birdie barrage at the Western Open.</p>
        <p>Usually, this is one of the more challenging stops on the PGA Tour, but with lower rough and soft greens this year, players are salivating as they reach the first tee.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Nick Price shot 63 to take the first-round lead. Today, it was Henninger's turn. He shot 33 on the front nine and followed it with an eye-opening 30 that propelled him to the top of the leader board. Ames also shot his 63 in the morning, moving him into second place, and setting up an interesting weekend, with Tiger Woods lurking six strokes off the lead.</p>
        <p>Aiming for his third career tour victory, Henninger was at 11-under par at 133 over all, a stroke ahead of Franklin Langham and two strokes ahead of five players who were tied at nine-under par -- Ames, Price, Fred Couples, Stuart Appleby and Steve Flesch. Woods was in the mix at five-under par after shooting a 69 today.</p>
        <p>It will be a challenge for Henninger, a 37-year-old tour veteran, to hold off proven winners like Couples, Price, Woods and Appleby. But Henninger is not seeking to end a long drought. He won last year's Southern Farm Bureau Classic.</p>
        <p>While acknowledging that the weekend would be a test, he also said he was looking forward to it.</p>
        <p>''If I continue to hit it good, I'm going to have a great tournament,'' said Henninger, who is 121st on this year's money list. ''It's tough, because you've got some world-class players up there -- Nick, Tiger, Fred. Everybody has the talent to win out here, but it's usually somebody that has experience.</p>
        <p>''I consider myself a world-class golfer, but they're the elite. But this feels good. This feels great. I've been out here long enough. I know I can play with them.''</p>
        <p>Henninger could play with anyone today. After making four birdies and a bogey on the front nine, he found a zone on the back with consecutive birdies on Nos. 11, 12 and 13, followed by an eagle at the par-5, 519-yard 15th.</p>
        <p>The eagle was set up by an impressive second shot, a 3-iron from 211 yards that landed 6 feet from the pin. Call that adrenaline.</p>
        <p>''I can not usually hit a 3-iron that far, but I jacked this one up big time,'' he said. ''It just exploded off the club.''</p>
        <p>Henninger followed that by making a 10-foot birdie putt at No. 16, and he could have set the course record if he had not missed an 8-foot birdie attempt at No. 17.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Henninger will start the day holding the lead, while Woods will play catch-up. Today's round was similar to Thursday's opening round for Woods. He hit the ball well, but he missed putts. Few people were counting out the world's No. 1 player.</p>
        <p>''If I'm making my normal amount of putts, I'm right there next to the lead,'' Woods said before heading to the putting green to practice before dark. ''If I can get a few putts to go down early, hopefully I can ride the momentum.''</p>
        <p>Price, who started the day with a three-stroke lead, could manage only a 72 today.</p>
        <p>The wind was not much of a factor, but Ames teed off in the morning, when conditions were nearly perfect for scoring. It was a lot different than the conditions Ames faced early in his career, when he played on the European Tour.</p>
        <p>''When you play in Europe, you're playing adverse weather conditions,'' said Ames, a 36-year-old native of Trinidad &amp; Tobago who lives in Canada. ''I think you have to be mentally tough to play in those kind of conditions, week in and week out. Here, this is paradise. Every shot I hit today came off the way I pictured  it.''</p>
        <p>The stage was set for a hotly contested weekend on a course where low scores can be had. Henninger has the lead. To keep it, he will have to remain aggressive.</p>
        <p>''The tour's getting so strong, you have to force yourself to continue,'' he said. ''You can't slow down out there.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Those who missed the one-under-par cut included PHIL MICKELSON (even par) and VIJAY SINGH (one-over par).</p>
