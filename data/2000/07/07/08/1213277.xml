      <abstract>
        <p>New York Yankees pitcher David Cone is hopeful that he will be used in relief of pitcher Dwight Gooden in game one of doubleheader against New York Mets (S)</p>

        <p>It was not until late Thursday that David Cone began to recover from the shock of being bumped out of the Yankees' rotation for the weekend, but after speaking with his father, he thought of a dream scenario: after Dwight Gooden pitches deep into this afternoon's game, in his first start at Shea Stadium since leaving the Mets in 1994, Cone could then relieve him, working out of the bullpen.</p>
        <p>''It would be nice to follow up Doc,'' Cone said. ''I'm still hopeful there will be a silver lining here somewhere this weekend. Maybe I can get a save; I haven't been able to get any wins.''</p>

        <p>It was not until late Thursday that David Cone began to recover from the shock of being bumped out of the Yankees' rotation for the weekend, but after speaking with his father, he thought of a dream scenario: after Dwight Gooden pitches deep into this afternoon's game, in his first start at Shea Stadium since leaving the Mets in 1994, Cone could then relieve him, working out of the bullpen.</p>
        <p>''It would be nice to follow up Doc,'' Cone said. ''I'm still hopeful there will be a silver lining here somewhere this weekend. Maybe I can get a save; I haven't been able to get any wins.''</p>
        <p>Gooden arrived in the city yesterday, but he will not officially join the team until today.</p>
        <p>Nelson Frets a Bit</p>
        <p>Jeff Nelson, a Yankee reliever, was upset with Joe Torre, the manager of the Yankees and this year's American League All-Star team, for not picking him. But Nelson said that issue is not a big deal to him, and that Torre ''is the best manager I've ever had.''</p>
        <p>What Nelson frets about more is how long Torre will remain as the Yankees' manager, and how it may influence his decisions in the off-season, when he is eligible for free agency.</p>
        <p>''He's been my manager for five years,'' Nelson said. ''How much longer do I want to continue here if he's not going to be here? He makes playing in New York easy. If I'm going to play for a different manager, I might as well go somewhere else.''</p>
        <p>Torre is under contract through the 2001 season.</p>
        <p>Nelson said yesterday that in light of the fact he will be a free agent, he will protect himself and be more careful about telling coaches when he has some soreness in his arm and making himself unavailable to pitch.</p>
        <p>His published comments to that effect yesterday ''disappointed'' General Manager Brian Cashman, who spoke at length with Nelson before last night's game.</p>
        <p>Posada Appeals Ban</p>
        <p>Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher, was suspended one game and fined $500 for his fight with Tampa Bay's Bobby Smith last Saturday.</p>
        <p>Posada appealed his penalty and may get a hearing after the All-Star Game break, but it stands to reason that the next time Chris Turner is used as the catcher and Posada is scheduled to have a day off, he could drop the appeal and serve his suspension.</p>
        <p>The Yankees feared that Posada would get a more substantial penalty, considering that many of baseball's altercations this year have resulted in relatively severe bans.</p>
        <p>The Yankees promoted pitcher Darrell Einertson from Class AAA Columbus before last night's game, and sent Ed Yarnall, who started Thursday and lasted less than two innings, back to Columbus.</p>
