        <p>In first-century Rome, where historians knew a glorious war when they saw one, Lucius Annaeus Seneca raised a troubling question: On the battlefield, do whole nations go mad and lose their humanity? ''We check manslaughter and isolated murders,'' he wrote in his Epistles, ''but what of war and the much-vaunted crimes of slaughtering whole peoples?''</p>
        <p>Almost since the first rock was thrown in anger, international legal experts say, people have tried to rein in the excesses of conflict and make them punishable. Benjamin Ferencz, a legal scholar who was a young prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials for Nazi war crimes after World War II, goes back to Ecclesiastes for an early Biblical guide to good behavior. ''You weren't supposed to kill your enemy and his suffering babes,'' he said. ''You take them as slaves. That was a big advance forward for the time.''</p>
        <p>In the 19th century, Abraham Lincoln commissioned the first modern war crimes code, which was duly written by Francis Lieber, the president's chief counsel during the Civil War. Next came the 1949 Geneva conventions, which codified rules for the humane treatment of civilians and combatants, including prisoners of war.</p>
        <p>Now another historic step has been taken. A week ago, legal delegations from more than 100 nations gathered at the United Nations and agreed to an exhaustive catalog of acts that will constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide for the world's first permanent International Criminal Court, now in the final stages of creation. The definitions of crimes cover dozens of pages in an effort to list unambiguously the most terrible things that people do to each other in the course of conflict.</p>
        <p>But from the grisly amputations of the hands of innocents in Sierra Leone to the systematic rapes of women in Bosnia and Rwanda -- or, some would say, to the bombing of Kosovo refugees by NATO warplanes -- modern conflicts raise new and complex issues. There still is not total agreement on universally accepted moral codes.</p>
        <p>It was easier at Nuremberg, and at the Tokyo trials for Japanese war criminals. The war crimes were more or less traditionally defined, and the victorious Allies were in charge. Today, most experts say, crimes are less easy to define, violations less easy to agree on. More actors are on the stage as well: human rights groups and other nongovernmental organizations are now instrumental in collecting information and lobbying for trials.</p>
        <p>''What we've seen in modern wars, especially many internal conflicts, is that war crimes and crimes against humanity are layered upon each other,'' said Michael P. Scharf, the director of the Center for International Law and Policy at the New England Law School in Boston, who is studying the changing face of atrocity. ''It's not just the military. You get neighbor fighting neighbor.'' Civilian culpability in what were once thought of as military crimes is a concept being thrashed out in tribunals for the Balkans and Rwanda, Mr. Scharf said. Along the way, he added, ''a whole new jurisprudence is emerging.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Scharf has been asking questions about how important trials are to peace and reconciliation. ''There is a conventional wisdom that if you could have a credible, neutral trial for war criminals, that would create a historical record that everybody could agree on and that would withstand the forces of revisionism,'' he said. ''This theory really emerges from the Nuremberg precedent.'' Mr. Scharf decided to test it in the Balkans.</p>
        <p>''In many towns in Bosnia where there was the worst ethnic cleansing,'' he said, ''the Muslims and Serbs, victims and perpetrators, have moved back into their old houses and are living once again as neighbors.'' They know about the war crimes trials at The Hague, because the George Soros Foundation is having them broadcast into Bosnia  with the idea that if people ''actually saw the testimony of the victims and the perpetrators, they couldn't deny it.''</p>
        <p>What Mr. Scharf found instead  was that both local people and outsiders who spoke with them could come away with very different interpretations of what the trials proved or did not prove. Mr. Scharf matched some of these reactions with his own research on what he calls ''the myth of Nuremberg'' -- that is, that all you have to do is establish an international tribunal, create an historical record ''and that's that.'' He said that polls taken in Germany only 10 years after the Nuremberg trials, by which time many Nazi sentences had been commuted, showed that ''90 percent of the people thought that these were show trials, political trials.'' It took another generation or two to change that perception, he said.</p>
        <p>It does not help when governments introduce their own national interests into the discussion. Mr. Ferencz, who at 80 still writes on war crimes and has been active in debates surrounding the International Criminal Court, says that during the cold war neither side wanted itself or its friends or clients held up to scrutiny. And Mr. Scharf notes that groups defined as ''political'' are not protected against genocide because the writers of the genocide convention of 1949 wanted Stalin's Russia on board, and Stalin had annihilated entire political and social groups. ''Your very definition of genocide has been corrupted from the very beginning by the necessity of cold war politics,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The cold war is over, but the story continues. Take Saddam Hussein's poison gas attacks on his troublesome Kurdish minority in 1988, and the world's response. ''Rather than simply going after rebel fighters,'' said Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights watch, Mr. Hussein ''would drop chemical weapons on Kurdish villages, killing some people and driving others out, and then rounding up those who were fleeing and bringing them to a series of concentration camps..'' But this crime, Mr. Roth said, ''was inconvenient for the international community to address.''</p>
        <p>The United States was supporting Iraq in a war against Iran at the time. ''The U.S. became interested in the crime only after the gulf war,'' Mr. Roth said. ''At this stage, the U.S. does support a tribunal, but there is no chance of getting it past Russia, China and France on the Security Council.''</p>
        <p>All three have, to one degree or another, backed Iraq in its standoff with the United Nations and the United States. The Security Council set up tribunals for the Balkans and Rwanda but not for Mr. Hussein or, for that matter, for Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader responsible for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians. ''The Security Council can't be trusted to bring criminals to trial,'' Mr. Roth said.</p>
        <p>More recently, many have turned their attention to the United States-led bombing in 1999 of Serbian targets in Yugoslavia to stop Serbian atrocities in Kosovo. Some groups, like Amnesty International, say they have found evidence of war crimes. Human Rights Watch, while not accusing NATO of war crimes, has been concerned about the use of cluster bombs near populated areas, attacks on civilian targets like factories or a major power plant, the bombing of a bridge near a busy market during daylight hours and air strikes against mobile targets (among them a column of refugees) from 15,000 feet without solid assurances that the targets were military. Mr. Roth said that advanced technologies required new ways of looking at the conduct of war.</p>
        <p>Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the Balkans war crimes tribunal, decided against an investigation of NATO's conduct of the war, but even the idea that she would explore such a move raised tempers in the Pentagon. This only contributed to the United States military's determination never to have anything to do with the International Criminal Court, fearing it would single out Americans for political or ideological reasons.</p>
        <p>Ruth Wedgwood, an expert on international law at the Yale Law School, sees some justification in those fears. She said that it was sometimes harder to make judgments on military behavior than one might think just by looking at the results of any given action.</p>
        <p>''It's one thing to say that NATO should rethink some of its war plans and find ways to fight better,'' Ms. Wedgwood said, ''and it's another thing to instantly criminalize them. There seems to be a rush to the most extreme category.'' The issue is complicated, she added, by the absence of military expertise on criminal tribunals.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wedgwood said that attempts to include sanctions -- the Clinton Administration's weapon of choice after precision bombing -- in the loosely defined area of war crimes opened another range of issues. Opponents of the sanctions imposed on Iraqin 1990 after the invasion of Kuwait and still in place say that they are killing thousands of Iraqis. ''People have seriously argued,'' Ms. Wedgwood said, ''that just as in the law of war, you can't target civilians for their own sake, by that same logic, sanctions that try to press civilians to overthrow their leaders should also be forbidden.''</p>
        <p>She went on: ''Some people will argue that enemy morale as such has always been and must be a military objective. Other people say that leads you down the path where you would actually seek to terrorize civilians.''</p>
        <p>No one says that bringing clarity or universality to an understanding of war crimes will be easy. ''It's all imperfect,'' said Mr. Ferencz, who has watched the world grapple with elusive war criminals for half a century. ''But I see progress. We are crawling toward civilization.''</p>
