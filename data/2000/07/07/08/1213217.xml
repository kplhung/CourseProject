        <p>The World Bank said this week that an eight-month investigation found no evidence to support allegations that a former Russian representative at the World Bank passed confidential information to a Russian commercial bank in 1993.</p>
        <p>The bank did conclude that the representative, Leonid Grigoriev, had established a business relationship with Inkombank, which is now defunct, and that he received $13,000 for expenses from the bank in 1993.

        <p>The World Bank said this week that an eight-month investigation found no evidence to support allegations that a former Russian representative at the World Bank passed confidential information to a Russian commercial bank in 1993.</p>
        <p>The bank did conclude that the representative, Leonid Grigoriev, had established a business relationship with Inkombank, which is now defunct, and that he received $13,000 for expenses from the bank in 1993. A bank official said that while that relationship did not specifically violate bank rules, it was outside what the bank considers acceptable activity for one of its executive directors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grigoriev's actions were the subject of articles in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and other publications in the fall of 1999. Some of the articles, which examined an investigation into how suspect Russian money flowed through the Bank of New York, raised questions about Inkombank's operations.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 22, 1999, The Wall Street Journal reported that the World Bank was investigating Mr. Grigoriev's ties to Inkombank. The newspaper cited a memo purportedly written by Mr. Grigoriev to Inkombank officials that discussed ways for the bank to profit from the Russian bond market. It reported that the memo was labeled ''strictly confidential'' and that it contained sensitive debt-market investment advice.</p>
        <p>Lending to Russia by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, its sister agency, was considered crucial to the health of the local bond market at the time.</p>
        <p>World Bank officials said that they began investigating Mr. Grigoriev only after The Journal provided them with a copy of the memo.</p>
        <p>The Times reported last January that the memo might have been a fake provided to The Journal by Emanuel E. Zeltser, an emigre Russian lawyer who became a source of information about Russian money laundering. The Times report examined Mr. Zeltser's role in spreading allegations about matters that were tangential to the money laundering investigation.</p>
        <p>Merrell Tuck, a World Bank spokeswoman, said today that bank officials and an outside law firm hired to lead the bank's investigation were ''unable to authenticate'' the memo. Therefore it found no evidence that Mr. Grigoriev gave sensitive information to Inkombank while working at the World Bank, she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grigoriev left the World Bank in 1997. When the World Bank began an investigation into his conduct last fall, he was put on leave from his job as director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a Moscow-based research institute that receives World Bank funds.</p>
        <p>The bank said in a statement this week that the payments Mr. Grigoriev received from Inkombank would ''prejudice against'' any employment he might seek at the bank itself for the next three years.</p>
        <p>But it said it now has no objections to Mr. Grigoriev's resuming his post at the research institute.</p>
