        <p>Vice President Al Gore said today that he backed the Clinton administration's decision to postpone the first federal execution in nearly four decades but did not support a nationwide death-penalty moratorium.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, a longtime supporter of capital punishment, spoke one day after administration officials indicated that the federal execution, of Juan Raul Garza, convicted of three drug-related murders, would be delayed beyond its scheduled date of Aug. 5 so that the Justice Department could first issue regulations for federal death-row inmates to follow in seeking clemency from the president.</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore said today that he backed the Clinton administration's decision to postpone the first federal execution in nearly four decades but did not support a nationwide death-penalty moratorium.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, a longtime supporter of capital punishment, spoke one day after administration officials indicated that the federal execution, of Juan Raul Garza, convicted of three drug-related murders, would be delayed beyond its scheduled date of Aug. 5 so that the Justice Department could first issue regulations for federal death-row inmates to follow in seeking clemency from the president.</p>
        <p>''I do support the decision to put these clemency procedures in place,  and pending that to hold off on this particular case,'' Mr. Gore said at a  news conference while campaigning in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>But he drew a line, at least for now, between the reprieve in this one federal case and any broader halt to executions.</p>
        <p>''I have not yet seen evidence that to me would justify a nationwide moratorium,'' Mr. Gore said. ''If such evidence emerges, I would not hesitate to support that step. But I have not seen it yet.''</p>
        <p>While the Justice Department is now completing a report on the issue of any racial and geographical disparities in federal capital cases, Mr. Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, said later today that what the vice president had been referring to was any evidence of systemic prosecutorial flaws suggesting large numbers of wrongful convictions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore today also continued an  assault on pharmaceutical companies and accused his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush, of being the industry's candidate.</p>
        <p>''I will lead the fight for you and not for the powerful,'' he told a group of the elderly in the nearby town of Bridgeville, just outside Pittsburgh. ''The H.M.O.'s and insurance companies are supporting my opponent. I am fighting for you.''</p>
        <p>A half-hour later, at the news conference, he declined to criticize his own chief media adviser, Carter Eskew, who, The Washington Post disclosed today, tried last year to obtain the pharmaceutical industry's lucrative public relations contract to help fight legislation like Mr. Gore's own proposal for a Medicare prescription drug benefit.</p>
        <p>The newspaper's article dealt with a memorandum to the industry from Mr. Eskew and BSMG Worldwide, his public relations firm at the time,  that said prescription drugs could become a central issue of the presidential campaign and proposed a public relations drive to ''chill support'' for legislative efforts concerning them.</p>
        <p>Asked how he countenanced such a proposal by Mr. Eskew, Mr. Gore said: ''You'll have to ask him that. What he did before he worked for me is something you'll have to ask him.'' The vice president called the efforts by Mr. Eskew and his former firm a ''completely separate matter'' from the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides said they did not contest that the memo was genuine. Mr. Eskew did not return a call to his office.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, Mr. Gore accused Citizens for Better Medicare, a group created by the drug industry, of running a media campaign that was ''polluting the airwaves.'' Democrats then tied the group to the Bush campaign by noting that the firm of Alex Castellanos, the media consultant working on the ads, had done work placing television commercials for the Bush organization.</p>
