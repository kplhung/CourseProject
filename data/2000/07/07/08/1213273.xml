        <p>In a rare face-to-face interview about his son's presidential campaign, former President George Bush said today that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas would emerge victorious in November largely because American voters periodically craved change, and because President Clinton's conduct in office had sharpened that appetite.</p>
        <p>President Bush, 76, who sat with his wife, Barbara, 75, for a nearly hourlong interview at the family compound here, said that Vice President Al Gore's ties to Mr. Clinton would not allow him to present himself credibly as a fresh start, and that his son's ability to do so would prove decisive.</p>
        <p>He also cited that same cyclical impulse in the electorate as the reason he was defeated in 1992, after one term in office, by Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''I think I was the victim of people wanting change,'' said Mr. Bush, who served as vice president under President Ronald Reagan for two terms before moving into the White House. He described voters' sentiments in 1992 as ''eight years of Reagan, four years of Bush, we want a change.''</p>
        <p>''And I think the same thing is true now,'' he said. ''I think people kind of like change, like the idea of change from time to time. I think that works for George's benefit.''</p>
        <p>He and Mrs. Bush also said that they thought the notion of ''Clinton fatigue'' was real, and that their son's frequent pledge to ''restore honor and integrity'' to the Oval Office was one that would resonate with voters who felt that those virtues had been compromised by Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''It isn't even debatable, in my view,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>Aides said that today's joint interview was one of only three or four that the Bushes had done in the last year, and their comments were striking for several reasons, chief among them the way in which Mr. Bush interpreted both his and his son's presidential fortunes in terms of historic forces outside their control.</p>
        <p>In assessing his son's prospects, Mr. Bush dwelled longer on the country's itch for something different than on the Texas governor's record and positions on issues, though he did offer hearty praise for both.</p>
        <p>And in chalking up his own defeat in 1992 to that same itch, he implicitly rejected the prevailing view that he lost because he failed to articulate coherently a domestic agenda or to run as spirited a campaign as Mr. Clinton did.</p>
        <p>The former president and the former first lady also spoke more harshly of Mr. Clinton's behavior in office than they had in the past.</p>
        <p>And while they and the Texas governor have dismissed suggestions that his candidacy was an act of redemption and revenge, his parents' words and demeanor -- especially his mother's -- suggested that they had not left 1992 completely behind them.</p>
        <p>At the very least, the Bushes exhibited a sensitivity to President Bush's legacy. Mrs. Bush, almost as an aside, murmured that the strong economy the country was enjoying  was really her husband's doing, and Mr. Bush mentioned that he was bothered by President Clinton's assertions that Mr. Gore was perhaps the best vice president ever.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to argue that on my own behalf,'' Mr. Bush said, referring to his own years as vice president. ''We had the, you know, drug interdiction program. We had the deregulation task force. I headed up the antiterrorist task force. I took the case for American missiles to Germany, the Pershings. I mean, there was a lot of substance there.''</p>
        <p>He said the Monica Lewinsky affair and Mr. Clinton's impeachment had hurt the country in real, meaningful ways.</p>
        <p>''There's been a diminution of respect for the office of the presidency, and it's not just here, it's abroad,'' he said, adding that voters' concern about that ''is going to manifest itself on Election Day.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Clinton's name had initially come up, Mrs. Bush signaled that she and her husband would take a pass on the topic, in accordance with a long-held vow not to speak ill of Mr. Bush's successor.</p>
        <p>But minutes later, Mrs. Bush was discussing Americans' lowered expectations for public officials, and when her husband said she could not blame that entirely on Mr. Clinton, she responded, ''Oh, I can.''</p>
        <p>The Bushes also addressed the persistent questions about whether their son had enough knowledge of foreign affairs to lead the nation. Mr. Bush, a former U.N. ambassador and an envoy to China who campaigned for the White House on his foreign policy expertise, acknowledged that his son did not know as much as he did when he became president.</p>
        <p>But, he added, ''He knows every bit as much about it as Bill Clinton did.''</p>
        <p>Did his son know as much as Mr. Gore?</p>
        <p>''Gore's had eight years of experience there,'' the former president acknowledged. ''But the way I should be judged on whether I knew foreign policy is by the kind of people I had around me. Because I didn't know all this stuff.''</p>
        <p>''You get good people,'' he added, echoing his son's frequent refrain that a president principally assembles a team, delegates responsibilities and makes final decisions based upon good advice. ''George knows enough to do that and enough about the world to have good judgment on his own at this point,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>Later, unprompted, he returned to the question of his son's preparedness.</p>
        <p>''I'm just going back in my mind,'' he said. ''You had Reagan, Carter, Clinton. What was their foreign affairs experience? They got elected president.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bush then chimed in with a reference to Mr. Gore's awkward toast, during a visit to China in 1997, with Prime Minister Li Peng, who had ordered the violent crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we ought to think of Al Gore in China at the time that he was caught with the Champagne glasses,'' she said. ''I'm not going to think about that.''</p>
        <p>''What are you doing?'' Mr. Bush said, acting displeased with her acidic interruptions but never really seeming so. ''You're not going to be in this interview if you're going to start talking like that. George will call and he'll be furious.''</p>
        <p>The Bushes have kept a fairly low public profile throughout their son's presidential campaign, taking care not to overshadow him, not to invite criticism that he was simply riding on his family's name, or to make accidental statements that could become controversial.</p>
        <p>But with the Republican convention just weeks away, they have decided to grant a few interviews. They are clearly eager to make the case for his candidacy. They clearly realize that the nostalgia that many Americans now feel for them can work to their son's advantage. (''Time heals a lot of wounds,'' the former president said.)</p>
        <p>And they clearly have a hard time containing their pride in what could be a historic circumstance. If the Texas governor is elected president, it will be only the second time in American history that the son of a president ascended to the same post.</p>
        <p>''It's mind-boggling for me,'' Mr. Bush said during the interview, which began in the living room of the main house, continued over a lunch of lobster salad on a rear terrace overlooking the Atlantic, and ended when he had to rush off with his son Jeb, the Florida governor, for a 12:30 p.m. tee time at a nearby golf course.</p>
        <p>Jeb Bush, who joined his parents for lunch, said that his brother, George, was benefiting from a Republican yearning to take back the White House -- a desire so strong that the party was managing to paper over internal divisions that had fractured it in the past.</p>
        <p>''Eight years in the wilderness brings a higher tolerance for diversity,'' Jeb Bush said, adding that 12 years in the wilderness had made the Democratic Party rally in a similar way around Mr. Clinton in 1992.</p>
        <p>''If you looked at Bill Clinton's record as governor of Arkansas, he was given a huge break by groups that were anxious to have a Democrat in the White House,'' Jeb Bush said.</p>
        <p>Although he did not make any sort of similar appraisal of his brother's record, he later added, ''Well, I think the same thing applies this year and benefits George, rather than Gore.''</p>
        <p>President and Mrs. Bush acknowledged that in 1992 or 1993 or even the beginning of 1994, they never expected a day like this to come. Mr. Bush left Washington as something of a pariah in the Republican Party, a man who had acquiesced to a tax increase and lost the White House.</p>
        <p>''They didn't want to have anything to do with me,'' he acknowledged.</p>
        <p>And George W. Bush had never really demonstrated the sort of political ambition that his brother Jeb had. When he told his mother that he planned to run against the incumbent Texas governor, Ann Richards, in 1994, she told him he would lose. His mother was wrong.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on the difference between then and now, his father said, ''I'm amazed -- still amazed -- at the way he's done.''</p>
        <p>His parents said that they never doubted that he had the talent and temperament for politics and governing, and they praised his performance as governor, saying that he had set priorities, stuck to them and delivered on his promises.</p>
        <p>But when asked about the reason for his short trajectory from new governor in January 1995 to presidential hopeful as early as 1998, his father again cited an external reality.</p>
        <p>''What happened was that he was elected governor of the second biggest state in the nation, and then he was re-elected with 70 percent of the vote, and anybody who's governor of a big state probably thinks, 'Hey, I could be president,' '' the former president said. ''And somewhere in there, I don't know where it was, George made up his mind. He didn't come ask us, incidentally.''</p>
        <p>''If George weren't running for president,'' his father added, ''whoever was the nominee of the Republican Party would surely be looking at him, among others, to be vice president. It's a six-inch putt, because of the importance of the electoral votes and the state.''</p>
        <p>He said that he was not getting involved in his son's search for a vice president, and he denied rumors that he might act as an intermediary to convince Gen. Colin L. Powell, a close friend, to reconsider his reluctance to take the job. He said that General Powell was unequivocally unwilling. In any case, the former president said, he reserved the right simply to be an extraordinarily proud father, generous with emotional support but not with advice on strategies or issues.</p>
        <p>''If you asked me, life or death, 'You've got to tell me how big the tax cut is that George is proposing,' I couldn't tell you,'' he said. ''I don't give a damn.''</p>
        <p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Bush had generally kind words for Mr. Gore, saying that when they were in the White House and he was a senator, they had met and liked him. When asked if Mr. Gore had gone overboard, during the impeachment proceedings, by calling Mr. Clinton one of the greatest American presidents, Mr. Bush expressed sympathy for the political bind in which Mr. Gore found himself.</p>
        <p>''Once you accept the vice presidency, then you've got to be a loyal vice president,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''But when the whole nation is embarrassed by something,'' he added, ''that loyalty can hurt you in terms of your own credibility. And if you waffle on it, that hurts you. It's a Catch-22.''</p>
        <p>''Greatest president, though?'' Mrs. Bush asked, referring to Mr. Gore's remark. ''In history?''</p>
        <p>''You're saying too much,'' Mr. Bush told her.</p>
