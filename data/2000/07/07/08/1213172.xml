      <abstract>
        <p>David R Dow letter, commenting on July 3 editorial, says the execution of innocent people is symptom of the broader problem that indigent capital defendants are too often represented by incompetent lawyers or by lawyers with inadequate resources</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You are correct when you say Gov. George Ryan of Illinois has single-handedly started a new national debate over the death penalty (editorial, July 3). Unfortunately, that debate is misguided because it is focused almost entirely on the question of how many innocent people are on death row.</p>
        <p>Innocent inmates are a symptom of a much broader problem -- a problem that the current national debate does not address. That problem is that indigent capital defendants are too often represented by incompetent lawyers or by lawyers with inadequate resources.</p>

        <p>The narrow focus on innocence contributes to the insidious notion that violations of constitutional rights are tolerable when the defendant is guilty.</p>
