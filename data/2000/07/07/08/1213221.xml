        <p>The court, the Swiss Federal Tribunal, also barred the man, known only by an alias, Isaac Bental, from Switzerland for five years.

        <p>Switzerland's top court today found an Israeli spy guilty of espionage and gave him a one-year suspended sentence for his part in a botched 1998 wiretap attempt.</p>
        <p>The court, the Swiss Federal Tribunal, also barred the man, known only by an alias, Isaac Bental, from Switzerland for five years. The sentence means that he will not serve any time in jail and can return to Israel, an outcome welcomed in a statement issued by Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>The wiretapping mission occurred in February 1998, as Swiss officials were in negotiations with American Jewish groups over bank accounts of Holocaust victims that had been languishing in Swiss banks for 50 years.</p>
        <p>The discovery of the agent trying to install electronic eavesdropping equipment in the apartment of a Lebanese-born car dealer suspected by the Mossad, the Israeli spy agency, of having links to the anti-Israel Hezbollah movement in Lebanon was an embarrassment for Israel and the agency.</p>
        <p>Four other people were apprehended with him but were released, the police said, because there was no evidence that they were engaged in illegal activity.</p>
        <p>Israel had to pay nearly $2 million in bail to guarantee that the agent would return for trial. In an unheard-of concession, Swiss justice officials allowed him to use an assumed name for trial on grounds that disclosing his real one would endanger his life. The agent, a short man with closely cropped hair, sat undisguised in open court during the four-day trial.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said the agent was spying, conducting illegal activity on behalf of a foreign country and using forged identity papers -- charges the agent admitted were true.</p>
        <p>His Swiss lawyers, who also did not know his true identity, urged acquittal because, they said, he was carrying out his assigned duty of preventing terrorist attacks against Israel.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors urged a 15-month prison sentence, arguing that there had been no immediate danger to Israel because investigators had found nothing to link the car dealer, Abdallah el-Zein, with militant actions of Hezbollah. Mr. Zein, who runs a center supporting Shiite Muslim beliefs, testified that he had not taken part in any extremist activity against Israel.</p>
        <p>The five-judge tribunal convicted the agent on all three charges, with the chief judge calling his actions an intolerable violation of Switzerland's sovereignty. The judge said the punishment was commensurate with that given in other spy cases.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, there was speculation that the Swiss and Israeli authorities had cut a deal for a light sentence to avoid further diplomatic strains. Israeli radio reported that Mossad agents were angry that one from their ranks had to submit to trial in a foreign country.</p>
