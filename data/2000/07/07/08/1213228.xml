        <p>Both stocks and bonds rallied yesterday after the June employment report brought investors news of slower growth and the hope that the Federal Reserve might now refrain from another increase in interest rates next month.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index jumped over the 4,000 mark for the first time since April, and cut its loss for the year to a little more than 1 percent. The Standard &amp;</p>
        <p>Poor's 500-stock index popped back into the plus column for the year, while the Dow Jones industrial average narrowed its decline. In the bond market, interest rates slipped.</p>
        <p>But both stocks and bonds are still locked in their recent trading ranges, and are likely to remain there until it is clear that the Federal Reserve has finished raising its short-term interest rate target to slow the blistering pace of economic growth and dampen inflationary pressures.</p>
        <p>While private-sector jobs continued to increase, the June data showed that the pace of growth was slowing. At the same time, income growth -- as measured by average hourly earnings -- remained moderate. And the increase in aggregate hours worked slowed some, signaling that worker productivity is still strong.</p>
        <p>Investors seemed to conclude that the pace of growth might be decelerating enough to keep Fed policy makers from raising interest rates when they meet again on Aug. 22. Inflationary pressures, as measured by wages and productivity, are also not too threatening.</p>
        <p>At the same time, economic growth is still robust enough to keep the corporate earnings outlook positive. The reporting season for second-quarter earnings gets into full swing next week and forecasters are still expecting a robust quarter, with growth of about 19 percent over the second quarter of 1999.</p>
        <p>''People have become less certain that the Fed will tighten at the August meeting, while that was the forecast after the June meeting,'' said Joseph Liro, chief economist at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.</p>
        <p>That sentiment was reflected in the slight decline yesterday in the yield on federal funds futures for August, to 6.53 percent from 6.545 percent. The federal funds rate, which is the interest charged on overnight loans between banks, is the Federal Reserve's target for short-term interest rates. It is now at 6.5 percent after an increase of half of a percentage point in May. Policy makers left the rate unchanged in June but warned that it might be raised again if the economy did not slow more.</p>
        <p>And, Mr. Liro added, investors can be ''confident that there will be enough aggregate demand out there to keep the economy growing.''</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index jumped 62.63 points, or 1.6 percent, to 4,023.20 yesterday, while the S.&amp; P. 500 climbed 22.23 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,478.90. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 154.51 points,  or 1.5 percent, to 10,635.98. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was moderate, with 931.8 million shares changing hands. The daily average for the year is 1.02 billion shares a day.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's rally turned the week into a nice positive. The Nasdaq rose 1.4 percent for the week and the technology-heavy index is now down just 1.1 percent for the year. But it is still 20.3 percent below its high for the year, set in March. The S.&amp; P. was up 1.7 percent for the week and is now up 0.7 percent for the year. But it is still 3.2 percent below its high set in March. The Dow finished the week 1.8 percent higher. It is still the worst performer of the three indexes, down 7.5 percent for the year and is 9.3 percent from its record high in January.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liro noted that while investors seemed to worry about the impact of the monthly jobs data on the stock market, the data has usually been a help to the stock market on the day it is released. He said that on 15 of the 18 Fridays on which the employment report has been issued since January 1999, the S.&amp; P. index has rallied. And in 12 of those rallies, the S.&amp; P. has risen 1 percent or more.</p>
        <p>There are several reasons for this sunny response, he said. One is that investors who are worried about the Fed's raising interest rates are calmed by signs that the economy is slowing a bit. The underlying growth, meanwhile, is a natural balm to the market. And often, just getting the news out of the way, even if it is negative, is a relief to many investors.</p>
        <p>Stocks were led higher yesterday by Hewlett-Packard, Wal-Mart Stores, Home Depot, I.B.M., Citigroup, Intel and Dell Computer. The stocks that fell included Qualcomm, BroadVision, Yahoo, Pfizer, Merck, Alcoa and General Motors.</p>
        <p>In the bond market, prices were higher as yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 6.00 percent from 6.04 percent on Thursday, while the price rose 8/32, to 103 19/32. The yield on the 10-year note has been fighting to get back below 6 percent for the last four weeks. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.87 percent from 5.90 percent Thursday.</p>
        <p>After one day of trading a cent below $30 a barrel, the price of crude oil rose yesterday. Oil for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was up 29 cents, or 1 percent, to $30.28. It is still unclear how much the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will actually increase its crude oil production. Saudi Arabia said Monday that it would raise its production by 500,000 barrels a day -- less than 2 percent of OPEC production -- if the price did not decline soon. But other OPEC members are still discussing how much of an increase they will accept.</p>
