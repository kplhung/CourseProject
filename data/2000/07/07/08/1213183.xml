        <p>Pilobolus Dance Theater once again offered a program of choreographic conjuring tricks on Wednesday night at the Joyce Theater. Some pieces of theatrical magic were more effective than others. As always, each production was created by a choreographer or a core group of choreographers who worked in collaboration with either the dancers performing it or the dancers who appeared in its premiere.</p>
        <p>All the offerings were clever, but some might have had emotional substance as well as visual appeal.</p>
        <p>A lack of depth was especially noticeable in ''Tantra Aranea,'' for which Robby Barnett and Jonathan Wolken were the principal choreographers. Set to recorded Iranian music, this duet began with Josie Coyoc holding a dignified pose while Matt Kent rolled across the stage like a tumbling tumbleweed. He soon calmed down and touched Ms. Coyoc in wonder. Then they huddled together, slithered about and entwined in what was obviously an erotic encounter, during which Ms. Coyoc gradually shed bits of her costume, designed by Angelina Avallone. Pilobolus bases much of its technique on acrobatics. This was sexy acrobatics.</p>
        <p>The action was also very obviously contrived. Eventually one became more aware of gymnastics than sex. The constantly shifting positions did not always convey a sense of increasing passion.</p>
        <p>The work with the greatest impact as a spectacle was ''Debut C,'' a punningly titled dance to Debussy for which Moses Pendleton was the principal choreographer. Neil Peter Jampolis's lighting and slide projections by Mr. Pendleton created an illusion of a landscape in which everything was in a state of perpetual metamorphosis. Much of the time, dancers held slender and easily bendable poles that quivered tremulously and were manipulated to resemble hoops and wings. And when a tape recording of an excerpt from ''La Mer'' gave way to ''L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune,'' dancers assumed poses inspired by Greek vase paintings reminiscent of those that Vaslav Nijinsky incorporated into his celebrated ballet to this score.</p>
        <p>''Debut C'' was notable for its sense of atmosphere. Two works with specifically dramatic implications were less effective.</p>
        <p>''Uno, Dos, Tray,'' for which Alison Chase was the principal choreographer, is one of many dances about sailors on shore leave that have been created over the years. The most famous example is Jerome Robbins's ballet ''Fancy Free.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Chase showed two sailors (played by Otis Cook and Gaspard Louis) flirting with a waitress (Rebecca Anderson). Unfortunately, at least at this performance, the antics, to music by Paul Sullivan, looked obvious, and the sailors seemed somewhat loutish.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan's score for ''Apoplexy'' was filled with explosive noises, and the choreography, supervised by Michael Tracy, Mr. Barnett and Mr. Wolken, required the dancers to collapse to these repeated bangs. Sometimes they toppled in a grotesquely comic manner like human bowling balls. At other times they appeared to be victims of gunfire. But one was always more conscious of the ingenuity of their actions than of any significance the events were intended to have.</p>
