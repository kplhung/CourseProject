        <p>The grandson of Gil Hodges, the first baseman for the postwar Brooklyn Dodgers, was charged with manslaughter yesterday after he accidentally killed the brother of a man believed to be a member of the Lucchese crime family, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hodges's grandson, also named Gil Hodges, is accused of killing Lance Marino, the brother of Craig Marino, who was described by investigators as a member of the Lucchese family.</p>
        <p>The police said Mr. Hodges, 26, and Mr. Marino, 27, both Brooklyn residents, spent Thursday night drinking at the Northside Cafe at North Seventh Street and Kent Avenue in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Toward the end of the evening, Mr. Marino fell asleep on the hood of Mr. Hodges's Range Rover, which was parked outside the bar. Mr. Hodges drove off with his friend still atop the car, the police said, and after about a mile, Mr. Marino fell off the car, striking his head on construction debris. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn district attorney's office charged Mr. Hodges with vehicular manslaughter, reckless endangerment, driving while intoxicated and reckless driving. His lawyer, Vincent Romano, said Mr. Hodges was ''in shock'' because he and Mr. Marino had been best friends.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romano, who said he had also represented Mr. Marino before his death, said Mr. Marino did not have any ties to organized crime. He said Mr. Marino was developing a recording label.</p>
        <p>''If you looked at him, he had blue hair -- something typical you'd find in the Village,'' Mr. Romano said.</p>
        <p>Craig Marino, 30, Mr. Marino's brother, is believed to be a member of the Lucchese crime family, said Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office.</p>
        <p>The elder Gil Hodges played for the Dodgers during the 1940's and 50's. He was a right-handed hitter with power and a solid glove at first base. He managed the New York Mets, leading them to victory in the 1969 World Series. He died in 1972.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hodges remained in custody last night.</p>
