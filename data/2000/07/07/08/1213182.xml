        <p>When Diana Ross and ''the former ladies of the Supremes'' revived the Supremes' hits on Thursday night at Madison Square Garden, it was a tribute to three musicians who weren't onstage: Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Edward Holland Jr.</p>
        <p>They were the ones behind the Supremes' string of indelible hits from 1963 to 1967. The H-D-H team wrote and produced lovelorn pop songs with a gospel kick: ''Where Did Our Love Go,'' ''I Hear a Symphony,'' ''Love Is Like an Itching in My Heart,'' ''My World Is Empty Without You,'' ''Come See About Me.'' Under their direction, Miss Ross pined repeatedly for a distant lover, confessing to lonely, sleepless nights that would turn to joy if he'd only come back. For many baby boomers, her girlish, melting croon became the voice of young love.</p>

        <p>When Diana Ross and ''the former ladies of the Supremes'' revived the Supremes' hits on Thursday night at Madison Square Garden, it was a tribute to three musicians who weren't onstage: Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Edward Holland Jr.</p>
        <p>They were the ones behind the Supremes' string of indelible hits from 1963 to 1967. The H-D-H team wrote and produced lovelorn pop songs with a gospel kick: ''Where Did Our Love Go,'' ''I Hear a Symphony,'' ''Love Is Like an Itching in My Heart,'' ''My World Is Empty Without You,'' ''Come See About Me.'' Under their direction, Miss Ross pined repeatedly for a distant lover, confessing to lonely, sleepless nights that would turn to joy if he'd only come back. For many baby boomers, her girlish, melting croon became the voice of young love.</p>
        <p>The set included the major H-D-H songs and a few lesser-known ones, like the Supremes' first hit, ''When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes,'' from 1963. The concert's staging made mild efforts to rekindle thoughts of the 1960's by showing photographs from civil rights marches during ''Reflections'' and hinting that ''Back in My Arms Again'' could refer to soldiers returning from Vietnam. But in an audience that had baby-boomer couples alongside diva devotees and an occasional drag queen, the overwhelming nostalgia was not sociopolitical but musical.</p>
        <p>To hear the old songs again, the sold-out audience forgave Miss Ross for touring with two latter-day Supremes, Lynda Laurence and Scherrie Payne, who joined the group after Miss Ross started her solo career in 1970, instead of the surviving 1960's Supremes, Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong.</p>
        <p>Each of the newer Supremes had a solo spot, with Ms. Payne showing off a multi-octave range in ''Stoned Love.'' But it was Miss Ross's show, of course. While the women had matching outfits -- sequined and feathered dresses, along with some ill-advised form-fitting suits -- the two 1970's Supremes generally kept a respectful distance from Miss Ross, smiling as if their jobs depended on it and curling their arms in more or less synchronized versions of the Supremes' old choreography. When the three women stood together for ''Stop! in the Name of Love,'' there were some near collisions.</p>
        <p>Rather than recreate the lean rhythm-and-blues arrangements of the great 1960's Motown studio bands, the concert deployed a large orchestra with strings, horns and backup singers, as well as 10 dancers doing a Gap ad version of 1960's go-go routines. In another modern touch, a teleprompter above the sound booth displayed the lyrics.</p>
        <p>But the audience wasn't worried about anachronisms, or about the shrill edge that came and went in Ms. Ross's voice. The people in the floor seats were on their feet, dancing and singing along, throughout the nearly two-hour set. They cheered each memorable H-D-H hook: the jabbing guitar that opens ''You Keep Me Hangin' On,'' the ''oohs'' that lead into ''Baby Love.'' During ''You Can't Hurry Love,'' Miss Ross walked down into the audience, accepting hugs and kisses from fans and giving them her microphone to sing a few lines; it was like Oprah Winfrey working a karaoke bar.</p>
        <p>Miss Ross's fans would have been disappointed if she hadn't included some of her post-Supremes hits, and she advanced as far as the disco era to sing ''Ain't No Mountain High Enough,'' ''I'm Coming Out'' and ''Upside Down,'' as well as Gloria Gaynor's diva staple, ''I Will Survive.'' She also summoned Luther Vandross up from the audience to sing with her in ''The Best Years of My Life.'' He didn't know the song, but by echoing Miss Ross with rich, curvaceous phrases, he brought down the house.</p>
        <p>Amid the bustle of the production, there were flashes of the vulnerability that made the Supremes speak so intimately to millions of listeners. It appeared in ''Love Child,'' as Miss Ross blurted, ''Take a look at me!'' and in a tender, slowed-down solo version of ''Reach Out I'll Be There.'' Most of the time, the neo-Supremes glittered and belted, and the songs did the rest.</p>
