        <p>Doug Messier, the father and agent of Mark Messier, indicated that while other teams had expressed interest in signing him, the Messiers were talking only to the Rangers.</p>
        <p>And, Doug Messier said, the deal to bring Messier, a 39-year-old free-agent center, back to the Rangers after his departure in 1997 could be done as soon as Monday.</p>
        <p>''We've had considerable interest, but we haven't responded,'' Doug Messier told The Canadian Press, a news agency, about other teams seeking to sign his son. ''Mark is basically looking at seeing what we can work out with the Rangers. We're just having conversations and exchanging some ways that might make it possible to work.''</p>
        <p>The two sides are believed to be close to a two-year, $11 million deal. But because Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager, is at the wedding of one of his sons in Banff, Alberta, this weekend, Doug Messier said, ''We'll have nothing until Monday.''</p>
        <p>According to several National Hockey League officials, Sather is also close to signing the free-agent defenseman Vladimir Malakhov.</p>
        <p>But the Messier deal would be the Rangers' signature signing because their former captain led the club to the Stanley Cup in 1994.</p>
