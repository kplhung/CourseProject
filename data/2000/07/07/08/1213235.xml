        <p>For months, Patrick Rafter rode out the mood swings that turned his good-natured personality inside out. The same Aussie who had always been ready with a good joke, a toast and a smile -- the profile of the perfect best man at a wedding -- had his spirits rustled when forced to confront his tennis mortality.</p>
        <p>Last October Rafter underwent shoulder surgery, and the No. 1 ranking he worked so hard to obtain last July evaporated. But against a backdrop of rehabilitation setbacks that left him pondering retirement at times, the 27-year-old Rafter looked at peace today. He realizes there are only so many serves left in his right rotator cuff, but he did not seem the least bit concerned with the dynamics of supply and demand on Center Court.</p>
        <p>To handcuff Andre Agassi's Houdini-like return game, Rafter needed a big serve with the high kick of a Rockette. And he needed as many as possible. As a gray afternoon extended into a crisp and clear evening, as the first set of this hypnotic semifinal morphed into the fifth, Rafter ignored the shrinking life span of his serve. Unfurling his body freely, he pounded a high percentage of first serves to undermine Agassi's strength on his way to a 7-5, 4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 victory that put him in Sunday's Wimbledon final against Pete Sampras.</p>
        <p>''Today was a match that I couldn't have played any better under the circumstances, on a big court against one of the best players ever,'' Rafter said. ''I think it was probably very satisfying to have actually done it on these grounds.''</p>
        <p>As a beaming Rafter lifted his arms in victory and spotted his brothers sitting in the friends box, Steffi Graf was hustling out of the stadium, not to return. Agassi's run was over, and the American dream final had vanished. Only one half of it was alive after the qualifier Vladimir Voltchkov allowed one pivotal shot to undo his upset chance against Sampras and lost, 7-6 (4), 6-2, 6-4.</p>
        <p>With a huffing Sampras scrambling to chase down a deep, sliced backhand, Voltchkov botched the easy backhand volley that would have evened the first-set tie breaker at 5-5. Voltchkov dropped his racket and hung his head. The little known 22-year-old from Belarus could not believe the mistake.</p>
        <p>''You hit a hundred out of a hundred of those in practice,'' said Voltchkov, who came to Wimbledon too cash-strapped to eat out and left with $193,000 in prize money. ''You miss one here. I guess it's the nerves.''</p>
        <p>He went on to lose the tie breaker and never posed a threat to Sampras again. The only problem Sampras had was with his sore lower left shin. At the end of the second set, he asked a trainer for assistance. Scurrying around with only a slight limp, Sampras played on. After easing through the tournament without having to face a seeded player, the top-seeded Sampras was in the final.</p>
        <p>''I'm not looking at Sunday as pressure,'' said Sampras, 28, who can break Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam victories by beating Rafter. ''I'm looking at it as an opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Sampras will go up against a player who has had his moments against him. They have not always been pleasant encounters, either. As a part of an odd tennis turf war when Sampras and Rafter both were in their early days on the tour, they exchanged a few heated words.</p>
        <p>''We get along fine,'' Sampras said. ''We'll just go out there and do the best we can and then shake hands. But everything is fine.''</p>
        <p>Today Rafter was not focused on old grudges. He was fixated on his recovery. Even as Agassi exited the grounds of the All England Club, he seemed genuinely pleased for Rafter. One year ago, Rafter, beginning to feel the first unsettling pains in his shoulder, was crestfallen after his semifinal loss to Agassi at Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>''Pat's gone through a tough stage here with his injury,'' Agassi said. ''He looks like he's found his game. I thought, in the crucial times of the match, he was playing tough.''</p>
        <p>Every game seemed to present a critical point during a match that unveiled a glorious contrast of styles. There was the ponytailed Rafter, a serve-and-volley fiend with a touch as soft as cashmere at the net, faced with a bald icon who uses his racket like a laser from the baseline.</p>
        <p>For four sets, neither style had a clear edge. To threaten Rafter's serve in the seventh game of the first set, the second-seeded Agassi pounced on a second serve and slapped it back at the feet of the Aussie as he raced to the net. In the same game, Rafter dared to reach back and go for a second-serve ace that split the court in half.</p>
        <p>This was just part of a riveting back-and-forth. Agassi would catch Rafter creeping to the net and airbrush a lob just over his outstretched racket. Rafter would watch Agassi rip a service return down the line, and then stab it like a swashbuckler for a half-volley winner. The high level of play left the crowd in a constant state of awe.</p>
        <p>''It's not good enough if you lose,'' said Agassi, who converted 4 of 9 break points while Rafter succeeded on 5 of 12. ''I didn't serve as well as I wanted to, made some careless errors. To his credit, he played well at the right time.''</p>
        <p>At the end of a 3-hour-18-minute match, the hiccups in Agassi's game caught up to him. In the sixth game of the fifth set, Agassi went for too much on a second serve in an attempt to keep Rafter on his heels. He double-faulted. That mistake set up the 12th-seeded Rafter with a break point. With Rafter at the net, Agassi sent a forehand passing shot hurdling into the net.</p>
        <p>Agassi could not break back. Rafter's first serve only got better as the match progressed. In the first set, Rafter put 53 percent of his first serves in. By the fifth, he was nailing 74 percent.</p>
        <p>As the match unfolded, it was obvious: Rafter's shoulder was holding up just fine. Just after Rafter left the postmatch interview, he was headed for his strength routines. Twice a day, he ties a rubber band from a doorknob to his racket and begins swinging away against the resistance. So far, this dedication to rehabilitating has extended his career. How long, no one knows.</p>
        <p>''I'm just taking it week by week, just really grateful to be out there,'' Rafter said. ''I'm hoping I can get a few more serves out than what everyone expects.''</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>VLADIMIR VOLTCHKOV, who progressed through the draw as a qualifier without a clothing deal, was approached by a company before his semifinal match against PETE SAMPRAS. ''One company said if I'm interested in wearing their clothes for this match there would be some bonus for it,'' said Voltchkov, who doubled his career earnings with his $193,000 prize check. ''The question was, were they interested in a long-term deal? They said they would have to think about it. I thought it was not good for me.'' So Voltchkov, who did not disclose the name of the company, showed up on Center Court with the same borrowed Adidas shorts and a Nike shirt he had worn all week. ''I just stick to the same clothes I had before,'' he said. ''I washed it, of course.''</p>
