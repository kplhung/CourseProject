        <p>Nineteen firefighters suffered minor injuries yesterday in a four-alarm fire in a Bronx apartment building that started when an electrical wire shorted, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>An 80-year-old tenant was taken to Jacobi Medical Center, but she did not appear to be injured, a hospital official said.</p>
        <p>The fire broke out about 12:30 p.m. in a seven-story brick apartment building at 216 203rd Street,  at Valentine Avenue, in the Bedford Park section. It was under control about an hour later. The fire started behind a wall on the top floor and spread through the roof, said Joseph Leoncavallo, a Fire Department spokesman.</p>
        <p>The injured firefighters were taken to Jacobi Medical Center, where they were treated for smoke inhalation, burns from falling debris and other injuries, said Nancy McPartlin, a hospital spokeswoman. They were expected to be released last night. The tenant, whose name was not released, had pre-existing medical conditions. She was in stable condition last night, a hospital spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>The eight apartments on the top floor of the building were gutted, Mr. Leoncavallo said, adding that he thought water and smoke damage to the other 48 apartments in the building would displace tenants on lower floors.</p>
        <p>''Fire was blowing through the roof,'' he said. ''With that amount of fire and that amount of water, I don't know. There's a lot of water damage there.''</p>
        <p>It was not known yesterday how many tenants were left homeless. They were offered temporary shelter at Public School 8, said Detective Madelyne Galino, a police spokeswoman.</p>
