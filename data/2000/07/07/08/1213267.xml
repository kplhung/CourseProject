        <p>Two off-duty police officers yesterday fatally shot an unarmed man who began punching them after a bizarre traffic altercation on the Grand Central Parkway in Queens, the police said.</p>
        <p>Although police officials did not explicitly defend the shooting at a news conference last night, they suggested that it was justified, saying that the shooting victim, Darnell Cisco, relentlessly punched the officers and grabbed at one of their handguns. The officers had apparently stopped on the parkway during what seemed like a traffic accident, the police said.</p>
        <p>The incident began around 6:20 p.m., when Mr. Cisco, a chef in his early 20's from Rome, Ga., leaped out the passenger side of a moving green Kia Sephia four-door sedan being driven by his friend, the police said. The car was traveling in the far left lane of the parkway near Francis Lewis Boulevard and going up to 45 miles per hour, the police said. Police officials said they did not know why Mr. Cisco jumped, but that the impact peeled skin off the right side of his body. Mr. Cisco was wearing a T-shirt, baggy shorts and work boots, the police said.</p>
        <p>An airport cab, operated by All Seasons, was behind the Sephia and swerved to the left shoulder to avoid hitting Mr. Cisco, the police said.</p>
        <p>The two off-duty Queens officers -- a male sergeant and a female detective -- were traveling in a black Dodge Dakota pickup truck behind the cab. The sergeant, who was driving, stopped on the roadway at a 45-degree angle to avoid hitting Mr. Cisco, a senior police official said.</p>
        <p>Officials said the shooting was under investigation.</p>
        <p>The police would not identify the two officers, who were not in uniform at the time of the shooting. The sergeant has been on the force for 13 years, and the detective for 15 years, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cisco then got up and ran around to the driver's window and began punching the sergeant, the police said. The sergeant stepped on the accelerator to get away, but slammed into the rear of the cab, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cisco then ran around to the passenger side and tried to drag the detective out the open window, the police said. She resisted, and both officers pulled out their badges and identified themselves, the police said. But Mr. Cisco punched the detective and tried to wrest a handgun away from her when she drew it, officials said.</p>
        <p>Then the officers began shooting, the police said. The sergeant fired once and the detective fired twice, but it was unclear how many shots hit Mr. Cisco, officials said. He died at the scene.</p>
        <p>The police said they did not find any weapons or drugs on the victim..</p>
        <p>''We have no idea why he did it,'' said William Allee, chief of detectives. ''We don't want to speculate.''</p>
        <p>After the shooting Mr. Cisco's body was slumped over the seat in the pickup truck the officers were in, and later covered with a white plastic bag.</p>
        <p>Mattie Real, the victim's grandmother, said in a telephone interview that he had never been in any kind of trouble. He moved from Glen Cove to Rome two years ago and lived there with a girlfriend and their daughter, she said.</p>
        <p>For the last three months he had been staying with his grandmother and his mother, Regina Real, in their apartment in Glen Cove to be near his sick aunt, who lives on Long Island in Uniondale, Mattie Real said.</p>
        <p>''He's a very sweet person,'' she said between tears. ''He doesn't get involved with anybody. That's what I don't understand.''</p>
        <p>She said that Mr. Cisco liked music and often went to a studio in New York City to record tapes with the man who was driving the Sephia. They grew up together in Glen Cove, Ms. Real said. She was unsure of how to spell the friend's last name, but said that his first name was Russell.</p>
        <p>Ms. Real said she saw Mr. Cisco yesterday morning before she went to work at a day care center in Glen Cove. He was going to take a nap, she said.</p>
        <p>Although the authorities did not release the names of the officers, the pickup truck is registered to a Stephen Borchers of Ronkonkoma, Long Island.</p>
        <p>The two officers suffered bruises to their faces and were taken to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset.</p>
        <p>The incident comes at a time when the New York Police Department is under scrutiny after a series of high-profile fatal shootings of unarmed black men. Those victims include Amadou Diallo, who was shot at 41 times last year in the Bronx, and Patrick M. Dorismond, who was killed earlier this year after being approached by officers working on an undercover drug operation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cisco was black and the two officers who shot him are white.</p>
        <p>The police were questioning the driver of the Sephia last night. He was not injured, and no arrests had been made.</p>
        <p>The cabdriver and his passenger were not injured.</p>
        <p>Three hours after the incident, traffic was still slowed to a crawl in the eastbound lanes of the parkway. The police had shut down two of the three major lanes, leaving only the far right lane and an exit lane open.</p>
