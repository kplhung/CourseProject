        <p>Pat Mahomes started waving a towel. It was the eighth inning, and the Mets, it appeared, would tie the Yankees as soon as Derek Bell's fly ball cleared the wall and dropped into the right field bullpen in front of Mahomes and the other Mets relievers.</p>

        <p>Pat Mahomes started waving a towel. It was the eighth inning, and the Mets, it appeared, would tie the Yankees as soon as Derek Bell's fly ball cleared the wall and dropped into the right field bullpen in front of Mahomes and the other Mets relievers.</p>
        <p>''It was way up there; I thought it was gone,'' Mahomes said afterward. ''Then all of a sudden, it slowed. The wind was swirling, and it just slowed and came straight down. Most times he probably wouldn't have made that catch, but he jumped perfect.''</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder, had time to get back to the wall, plant himself under the ball and jump straight up to catch it, saving a homer and the game. If O'Neill had been coming from an angle, Turk Wendell said, he probably would not have caught it. If the ball had been hit at Yankee Stadium, the Mets' reliever added, it would have been out easily.</p>
        <p>On the bases, Bell was stunned. He stood still for a moment after rounding first. ''Hold on,'' Bell said he thought. ''Wait a minute. What's going on?''</p>
        <p>This was going on: the Yankees were making another big defensive play to rob the Mets of any chance against Orlando Hernandez. Bell's deep drive brought in Melvin Mora, who had tripled, but it seemed deflating. Hernandez faced one more batter and retired him, completing eight brilliant innings in a 2-1 Yankee victory over Al Leiter before 54,132 fans, the largest crowd to see a regular-season game at Shea Stadium since 1972.</p>
        <p>The victory, coupled with Toronto's loss to Montreal, thrust the Yankees into first place in the American League East and provided a stunningly good opener to this weekend's four-game series, which resumes on two fronts today: an afternoon game at Shea, with Dwight Gooden returning there as a starter for the Yankees, then a night game at Yankee Stadium to make up for a rainout there on June 11.</p>
        <p>Right field at Shea is tricky, said Jay Payton, who plays center for the Mets. When Payton tosses a few blades of grass into the air to check the wind patterns, winds from right field often blow the grass straight in. During the Mets' last homestand, Payton felt he had crushed a ball, only to see it skim off the right fielder's glove and barely make it out.</p>
        <p>''The wind had a lot to do with the game,'' O'Neill said. ''That ball that Bell hit probably would have gone out.''</p>
        <p>Instead, it ended up as only the most important of the Mets' near-misses last night. Hernandez was magnificent, but whenever the Mets hit a ball hard, it seemed to end up in a Yankee glove.</p>
        <p>Asked if his team could have done anything differently, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said they could have placed their hits about five inches in either direction. ''It was one of those nights,'' he said, ''when placement was the key.''</p>
        <p>In the second inning, after Robin Ventura's one-out double, Todd Zeile smashed a ball to third. Caught by Scott Brosius, the third baseman.</p>
        <p>In the third, Benny Agbayani led off with a single, and Leiter sacrificed him to second. Mora bounced a bunt in front of the plate -- but he ran into the ball on his way to first for an out.</p>
        <p>In the fifth, Hernandez walked the first two hitters and faced Agbayani, who swung at the first pitch and lashed a hard drive up the middle. But Hernandez -- looking more like a shortstop -- leaped, reached across his body and snared the ball.</p>
        <p>He turned and fired to Derek Jeter covering second base for the second out. Payton, who was at first, scrambled back to beat Jeter's throw and avoid the triple play.</p>
        <p>Agbayani said he was stunned. So was Valentine, who never saw Hernandez catch it because he was trying to see if Jeter, the shortstop, would have a play on it. ''I looked by the mound,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>And so it continued. In the seventh, Zeile missed a double down the line when his grounder went just foul. Agbayani ended that inning with a line out to first. Payton took a late swing on a Mariano Rivera pitch in the ninth, but it, too, landed just foul. Payton flied to right with a runner on to end the game.</p>
        <p>It all left Leiter, the Mets' starter, feeling odd as he answered questions after the game. Leiter is going to the All-Star Game, and he said he pitched as well as he has all season, working eight innings and permitting just two runs and six hits. But he got the loss, his record dropping to 10-2.</p>
        <p>''I was the losing pitcher,'' Leiter said, ''but I would take this start for the next 15 starts.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees got all the runs they would need in the first. Leiter had allowed only one first-inning run this year, and his first inning last night was easily his worst of the season. The first five Yankee hitters reached base.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch led off with a walk, but before Leiter's first pitch to Jeter, he picked Knoblauch off first. Then Jeter checked his swing on a two-strike curveball; Leiter disagreed when the umpire said Jeter had not swung. Jeter then lined a single to right, and O'Neill advanced him to third on a ground single through the left side.</p>
        <p>Leiter got ahead of the next two hitters, but it made no difference. He threw a high fastball to Bernie Williams that went for a run-scoring single as Williams extended his hitting streak to 17 games. Then Leiter got ahead of Jorge Posada but overthrew a curveball. Posada lined it for a single, O'Neill was running on the pitch and scored from second, and the Yankees led, 2-0.</p>
        <p>But after that, Leiter faced one hitter over the minimum until he was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the eighth. He also got another pick-off, his eighth this year.</p>
        <p>Leiter did not like the outcome of the game, of course, but he liked its pace.  ''Through the weekend, maybe this is what to expect -- hard-fought, low-scoring games,'' he said. ''A 2-1 game is what I think baseball should be.''</p>
        <p>A sellout crowd and a bullpen full of Mets thought the score should have been something else.</p>
