        <p>Shawn J Rubel letter replies to Gail Collins's July 7 article deploring the length of the latest Harry Potter book</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is true, as Gail Collins writes (column, July 7), that we will ''mourn the days'' when Harry Potter ''existed only in books,'' which were ''smaller than breadboxes.''</p>
        <p>Yet what does length have to do with a book's magic? Would ''David Copperfield'' be better if it were shorter? Would ''War and Peace''?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is true, as Gail Collins writes (column, July 7), that we will ''mourn the days'' when Harry Potter ''existed only in books,'' which were ''smaller than breadboxes.''</p>
        <p>Yet what does length have to do with a book's magic? Would ''David Copperfield'' be better if it were shorter? Would ''War and Peace''?</p>
        <p>When I heard that ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' was going to exceed 700 pages, I was ecstatic for two reasons. First, I love long books. Second, most children are daunted by a book's length. But with Harry Potter, length will not matter, and maybe it will never matter again.</p>
        <p>Books should be savored, whatever the length. Here's to hoping that ''Goblet of Fire'' lives up to its predecessors.</p>
