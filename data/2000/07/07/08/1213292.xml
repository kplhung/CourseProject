        <p>Re ''A Man's Right to Choose,'' by Thomas Lynch (Op-Ed, July 5):</p>
        <p>I am glad that a man is speaking out against a system that sees men as mere adjuncts (bank accounts) in the human reproductive process. Why, indeed, do women have all the rights and choices and men have only responsibilities?</p>

        <p>Our attitudes about pregnancy continue into the life of the child. Divorce laws make it clear that children are little more than the property of the mother. Thank you for daring to challenge attitudes that are not just unfair to men, but also to children.</p>
