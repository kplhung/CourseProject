        <p>Presidential campaign of 2000 attracts 224 candidates as of June, not including Vice Pres Al Gore and Gov George W Bush; Paula Bennett, Michael T Strauss, Temperance Lance-Council and other candidates on the fringe tell why they run; photos (M)</p>

        <p>If only she had more money, Paula Bennett said, she could get her message out. For now, she talks to relatives, civic groups and social service workers. ''I've only raised a few hundred dollars,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bennett, a political independent from Lincoln, Neb., is running for president this year in a field that is far more crowded than one might think. As of last month, 226 people had filed papers with the Federal Election Commission indicating their intention of seeking the White House. The list includes major party candidates like Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas but also candidates so far on the political fringe -- in some cases, even beyond -- that they make people like Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party, John Hagelin of the Natural Law Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party seem like mainstream contenders.</p>

        <p>If only she had more money, Paula Bennett said, she could get her message out. For now, she talks to relatives, civic groups and social service workers. ''I've only raised a few hundred dollars,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bennett, a political independent from Lincoln, Neb., is running for president this year in a field that is far more crowded than one might think. As of last month, 226 people had filed papers with the Federal Election Commission indicating their intention of seeking the White House. The list includes major party candidates like Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas but also candidates so far on the political fringe -- in some cases, even beyond -- that they make people like Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party, John Hagelin of the Natural Law Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party seem like mainstream contenders.</p>
        <p>Take Martin J. McNally, for example. His filing says he represents the National Christian Party, but it is unlikely anyone might find him on the campaign trail. He is serving a life sentence for aircraft piracy at a federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind.</p>
        <p>Nor is Julian Starr of Huntington, N.Y., likely to upset any favorites. He is only 18 years old, a high school graduate headed for the State University of New York at Stony Brook this fall. He said he filed this year in anticipation of running for president in 2016, when he will turn 35, the youngest age a president can be. ''This should be a very good learning experience,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Presidential elections historically attract a wide variety of contenders. Over the years, voters have cast ballots for Free Soilers, Know Nothings, Prohibitionists, Greenbacks, Bull Moose Progressives and States Righters as well as for members of mainstream parties, like Republicans, Democrats, Federalists and Whigs. In 1996, besides casting ballots for the Republican, Democratic and Reform tickets, voters also supported at least eight other parties. This year, the party choices include Socialist, Corrective Action, Progressive, Common Sense, Fly Birds, Veterans Industrial, Populist-Democratic Viking, Priorities, Light, Anti-Hypocrisy, Freedom, Church and Family Values.</p>
        <p>And it has been a slow year, perhaps reflecting a nation enjoying peace and economic stability. The number who have filed the single form required by the election commission is the fewest since the commission was formed in 1974, and a sizable drop from the record year of 1988, when 330 people filed. Candidates who expect to raise at least $5,000 must file; all others file voluntarily.</p>
        <p>In either case, most of those running this year will slip through the campaign without so much as a nod of acknowledgment. Not only do they lack the money and staff to compete, they take no steps to comply with state regulations to get onto the ballot, leaving them to gain votes only as a write-in. It is the rare member of the fringe who has the resources to finance a campaign, although it happens. Heather Harder, a Democrat from Crown Point, Ind., said she has addressed groups in 42 states, talking about her pet issue, structural change in government to bring it closer to average citizens.</p>
        <p>In that regard, Ms. Harder is typical of the outsiders who filed papers. At best, many say, they hope to influence Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush on an issue or two. But even better-known alternative candidates, like Ralph Nader of the Greens, Harry Browne of the Libertarians or Ross Perot, who represented the Reform Party in 1992 and 1996, do little more than draw new focus to old issues.</p>
        <p>''Some of the fringe parties take up a cause they feel is important and not being addressed,'' said Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University.</p>
        <p>But as Alan Brinkley, a history professor at Columbia University, noted: ''It's very hard for a third-party candidate to do more than influence the behavior of the Republicans or Democrats. It's slightly unusual to have two, perhaps three, alternatives who could claim to be taken seriously, but I don't see any major new party emerging.''</p>
        <p>For many candidates, running for president is a quadrennial affair. Ms. Harder, an author and bookstore owner, engaged in a ''practice'' campaign four years ago and is running what she called ''a symbolic campaign'' to draw attention to government reform.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, she probably did not notice her competitor from Newburyport, Mass., Michael T. Strauss, the standard bearer for Mike's Party, of which he is the only member. In 1996, Mr. Strauss said, his campaign slogan was, ''Vote for Mike or don't vote at all.'' How successful was he? ''More than half the people registered didn't vote that year,'' he said, referring to the 49 percent turnout in 1996. ''So I did quite well, actually.''</p>
        <p>For this year's campaign he bought 1,000 wooden nickels to pass out. They say, ''Re-elect Mike Strauss.''</p>
        <p>''It makes me sound more experienced,'' Mr. Strauss said.</p>
        <p>Some candidates seem more serious. Bernard Palicki of Huntsville, Ala., who ran for Congress six years ago as a Republican and now heads the Corrective Action Party, has an Internet site to rail against global trade and federal banking laws.</p>
        <p>''I'm using my candidacy as a vehicle to get ideas across,'' Mr. Palicki said. ''But I'm not accepting any money, and I'm not making speeches. I'm strictly on the Internet.''</p>
        <p>Temperance Lance-Council, a local activist in Los Angeles, formed the Anti-Hypocrisy Party last year as a protest against what she called the arrogance of public officials. A candidate from Mill Valley, Calif., named Da Vid (who was born 56 years ago in Manhattan as Dolph Ornstein), founded the Light Party to highlight the relationship between environment and health. Ernest Lee Easton of South Bend, Ind., head of the Veterans Industrial Party, is a Vietnam veteran who is concerned about veteran rights, campaign finance reform and issues related to job security.</p>
        <p>But others leave the clear impression they do not really expect to dwell in the White House anytime soon. Daniel Pearlman, an independent candidate from Taos, N.M., believes presidential ballots should contain no names so voters can select anyone they choose. To enhance his political stature, Mr. Pearlman has already declared himself ''President of New Mexico.'' Freddy Sitnick of Owings Mills, Md., an independent, said he had written to all 50 states asking to be placed on the ballot. So far, none have responded. Maybe that is because Mr. Sitnick tells people he is the Messiah.</p>
        <p>And Clay Oliver Hill of Kissimmee, Fla., another independent, said he was worried about the international terrorist rings that he believed had headquarters near his house.</p>
        <p>''I doubt I'll be invited to the debates,'' Mr. Hill said.</p>
        <p>But among those who have filed with the election commission, maybe Raymond Kenneth Petry, an independent from Honolulu, chose the most realistic path to power.</p>
        <p>He declared himself a candidate for vice president.</p>
