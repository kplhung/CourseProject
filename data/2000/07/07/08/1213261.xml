        <p>Joe Torre will make excuses for his players, he will fib for them, he will support them, he will protect them from pressure when he can. But what has become apparent in the last 10 days is that the Yankees' manager is unwilling to lose interminably with them.</p>
        <p>Loyalty is conditional, as David Cone, Tino Martinez, Ricky Ledee and Chuck Knoblauch have learned. There has been a subtle but pervasive shift in the Yankees' organization, acknowledging that the team will not dig itself out of its long slump without changes that affect some of its most respected members.</p>
        <p>Torre had always manipulated his rotation to include Cone, and this weekend, Cone was bumped out.</p>
        <p>Martinez, once a centerpiece in the Yankees' attack, was dropped out of the lineup Tuesday, even when the Baltimore starter was right-handed. Ledee, 6 for 10 in the 1998 World Series and long considered one of the organization's staple products, was traded.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch's throwing troubles have been endured for two years, but now Torre is employing him intermittently as a designated hitter, using a better defensive second baseman instead.</p>
        <p>''That's your main objective -- you have to win,'' said Jeff Nelson, the reliever who has complained mildly about Torre's decision to leave him off the All-Star team. ''No matter how you go about doing it, no matter if you step on feelings or step on guys, you're the manager in a very tough market and for a team that has a reputation for winning, and you've got to do what it takes to win.</p>
        <p>''If it means sitting guys, or if it means taking guys out of the rotation or not pitching guys out of the bullpen, that's what you've got to do. That just comes along with managing this team.''</p>
        <p>Martinez has struggled off and on since Armando Benitez made him the target of a 98 mile-an-hour fastball on May 19, 1998, when Benitez was with the Orioles. Martinez was a good player but not a great player the rest of that season and in 1999, although he and Paul O'Neill continued to be viewed as leaders because of their intense approach to each at-bat.</p>
        <p>This year, Martinez's production ranks among the very worst for major league first basemen, even though the four batters ahead of him in the lineup reach base consistently.</p>
        <p>Torre will always remind reporters how important Martinez has been to the Yankees. But when David Justice joined the Yankees last week, Torre dropped Martinez from the No. 5 slot in the lineup to No. 7. And on Tuesday, when the Yankees faced the Baltimore right-hander Scott Erickson, Torre benched Martinez for Jorge Posada.</p>
        <p>Loyalty gave way to practicality: Posada has been hot, Martinez is not.</p>
        <p>Ledee had been a renowned prospect in the organization for years.</p>
        <p>Torre and other Yankees officials have no doubts that Ledee will thrive in his career, but Ledee's sensitivity seemed to hold him back.</p>
        <p>If he would strike out in his first at-bat, for the rest of the day his defense suffered and he was atrocious in his remaining at-bats. The Yankees waited for more than a year for Ledee to blossom, hoping that he would succeed, but he did not. So the team shipped him in the deal for Justice.</p>
        <p>Torre mostly ignored Knoblauch's throwing jitters until late in the post-season last year, and when he finally addressed the problem, he made sure to use a veteran like Luis Sojo to make it easier for Knoblauch.</p>
        <p>But Knoblauch's problems erupted again in May and now Torre will remove him in the middle innings, if necessary and if the Yankees have a big lead. Knoblauch will probably serve as the designated hitter in one game of today's doubleheader.</p>
        <p>The change that provided the greatest jolt to the Yankees' players was removing Cone from the rotation for this weekend. ''He's definitely the guy who is the most respected on this team,'' Nelson said, ''because he never makes any kind of excuses. You feel bad -- this guy has had so many innings in his arm. He's probably pitched with things that nobody knew about. It would be tough to swallow for anybody.''</p>
        <p>Cone said of Torre: ''He's got to do what's best for the team. I feel bad for him, because it was my pitching that put him in that position. He had a tough call to make, because of my poor pitching.''</p>
        <p>There has been some griping and turmoil typical for a struggling team. Martinez is annoyed with Torre's constant refrain about his slumps, that Martinez is pressing; Martinez said he would rather have someone tell him what is wrong with his swing.</p>
        <p>After Torre did not select him for the All-Star team, Nelson suggested that, with his impending free agency, he would be unavailable to pitch when he felt unusual stiffness in his arm.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are promoting Dwight Gooden to pitch today, even though some officials think the move invites problems in the event Gooden bombs.</p>
        <p>But Torre has bigger issues. His team is slumping, its confidence has eroded and for the first time since he took over as Yankees manager, he is telling some of the team's most established players that they are not good enough.</p>
