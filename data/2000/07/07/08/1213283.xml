        <p>READING about New York politics lately can make you wonder if you've turned to the wrong part of the newspaper. A lot of it sounds as if it ought to be on the television page, in an article on a new daytime soap opera.</p>
        <p>This weeper has everything: politics, stymied ambition, a marriage on the rocks, a bitter wife, whispers of an old love affair, a new girlfriend and a cancer menace.</p>
        <p>Not satisfied with power, romance and disease? How about a little crime?</p>
        <p>Throw in a tale about how the main character's father once did prison time for an armed stickup and then became a leg breaker for loan sharks. While you're at it, let's have an uncle who ran a gambling operation out of his bar. And a cousin who was a wise guy gunned down by the feds.</p>
        <p>For want of a better title, we can call the soap opera, ''As the Mayor Turns.''</p>
        <p>This has been some year for Rudolph W. Giuliani, and it could easily get worse because of revelations in two new books about him. Details have dribbled out all week, none more startling than criminal skeletons from the Giuliani family closet that are described in Wayne Barrett's ''Rudy! An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani'' (Basic Books).</p>
        <p>Things have been going so badly for the mayor that the first instinct was to sympathize with him the other day when he asserted his right to privacy and denounced ''the almost crazed atmosphere'' of the press probing into his personal matters.</p>
        <p>He was talking specifically about the medical treatment he plans for his prostate cancer. But he might as well have been musing about the electron microscope now trained on his love life and family history.</p>
        <p>Watching someone's life being turned into a fishbowl isn't pretty. First instincts are not always dead-on, though. Sympathy, while still there, was joined by a second thought: that Mr. Giuliani brought much of his privacy ordeal on himself.</p>
        <p>Who disclosed his cancer? He did, though it was after a reporter saw him at a hospital. Why is it then surprising that New Yorkers would be curious about how he deals with the problem?</p>
        <p>Who announced to the news media that he was separating from his wife, Donna Hanover? He did -- before he even told her. Until then, New York journalists had been most circumspect about his plainly unhappy marriage.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Giuliani who then showed off his new ''very good friend,'' Judith Nathan. No reporter suggested to him that he take Ms. Nathan one May evening on a 10-block stroll through a sea of cameras.</p>
        <p>As for the revelations that his father, Harold, was an ex-con, the mayor has not confirmed them. But he also has notably passed up several opportunities to deny them. It is not clear if he even knew Harold Giuliani had been in Sing Sing in the 1930's, a decade before Rudolph Giuliani was born.</p>
        <p>A natural inclination was to agree with him the other day when he said, ''My father died 19 years ago, and the details of his life died with him.''</p>
        <p>YET only four months ago the mayor did not think that Patrick M. Dorismond deserved the same consideration after he was shot to death, though unarmed, by an undercover police officer. Then, Mr. Giuliani did everything he could to blacken Mr. Dorismond's reputation, even releasing the dead man's old juvenile court records. When critics protested his tactics, the mayor brushed them aside. ''Privacy interests and rights expire with you,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So much for his faith in privacy. Shouldn't what is good for Patrick Dorismond also be good for Harold Giuliani?</p>
        <p>The bigger question would seem to be whether the Giuliani family secrets, if true, tell us anything about the mayor who has so thoroughly dominated New York.</p>
        <p>Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo thinks not. ''I find it very difficult to make a case that it is relevant unless you can show me the connection between the father's conduct and the son's quality,'' he said. ''And I don't see it.''</p>
        <p>Maybe he's right.</p>
        <p>But don't be surprised if New Yorkers are fascinated that the racket-busting mayor may have come from a mob-connected family. Or if some wonder whether his war on the Mafia had something to do with nasty things he saw up close as a young man. Or if some ask why he is so unsympathetic to almost anyone who has had a brush with the law when his own father's story, as Mr. Barrett said this week, ''should tell Rudy something about the complications of life.''</p>
        <p>Those asking such questions may well be off base. But the armchair psychoanalysis seems inevitable all the same, as inevitable, perhaps, as further installments of ''As the Mayor Turns.''</p>
