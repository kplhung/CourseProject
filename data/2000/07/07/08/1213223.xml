        <p>Following are excerpts from an interview today with former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, about the presidential campaign of their son Gov. George W. Bush of Texas:</p>
        <p>Q. Are you confident your son will win?</p>
        <p>GEORGE BUSH. I think he'll win. Again, it's mind-boggling for me, a former president, to think our son will be president. I think a lot of it is that after this primary, where he took such a huge pounding, the press had a massive love affair with John McCain -- nobody can question that, that's just objective, even from a nonobjective guy -- but after that, there was a distorted view of George, I think, and now . . . people are beginning to see what his heartbeat is, what he's really like, that he's a decent person, that he likes people, has done a good job in his state. I don't think in the fall that the press is going to have the same love affair with Gore that they had with John McCain.</p>

        <p>GEORGE BUSH. I think he'll win. Again, it's mind-boggling for me, a former president, to think our son will be president. I think a lot of it is that after this primary, where he took such a huge pounding, the press had a massive love affair with John McCain -- nobody can question that, that's just objective, even from a nonobjective guy -- but after that, there was a distorted view of George, I think, and now . . . people are beginning to see what his heartbeat is, what he's really like, that he's a decent person, that he likes people, has done a good job in his state. I don't think in the fall that the press is going to have the same love affair with Gore that they had with John McCain.</p>
        <p>Q. Why?</p>
        <p>MR. BUSH. Well, I think they don't like him so much.</p>
        <p>Q. For a good reason?</p>
        <p>MR. BUSH. Oh, I don't know about that. I'm going to leave it to George's campaign to define Al Gore. He can identify with people, and I think that's coming through. And also, they're going to want change. And I believe there is a Clinton fatigue. And all of these things will inure to George's benefit just as Gore will be trying to have this good economy inure to his . . .</p>
        <p>Q. Why do you think there's Clinton fatigue?</p>
        <p>BARBARA BUSH. We took a vow. Can't break it. Never to speak badly about your, your ----</p>
        <p>MR. BUSH. We don't get into that because he beat me and then it looks like a poor sport, but I did speak out once in the depths of the Monica Lewinsky thing and said this is disgraceful. But I think it's more than that very unhappy time period of impeachment. I think it's change. I think I was the victim of people wanting change: ''Eight years of Reagan, four years of Bush, we want a change.'' And all the things that I felt strongly about never materialized as issues. And I think the same thing is true now. I think people kind of like change, like the idea of change from time to time. I think that works for George's benefit. I don't think Gore can present himself as a candidate of change. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. Does your son know as much about foreign affairs as you did when you were elected?</p>
        <p>MR. BUSH. No. But he knows every bit as much about it as Bill Clinton did.</p>
        <p>Q. As much as Gore?</p>
        <p>MR. BUSH. Gore's had eight years of experience there. But the way I should be judged . . . is by the kind of people I had around me. Because I didn't know all this stuff. You know, how much reduction you can do on atomic weapons. But Brent Snowcroft did. I didn't know how Gorbachev was going to react when the Iraqis invaded Kuwait, but Jimmy Baker was over there the next day, with Shevardnadze and Gorbachev, and figured it out. I didn't know how the military would work, but we had Colin Powell and Norm Schwarzkopf. We had confidence in generals and officers who were right when all the critics were wrong. So how do you know? You get good people. George knows enough to do that . . .</p>
        <p>Q. If you were campaigning against your son, wouldn't you be calling his tax cut too large?</p>
        <p>MR. BUSH. You won't believe this. I literally don't go into the analysis of these issues. If you asked me, life or death, ''You've got to tell me how big the tax cut is that George is proposing,'' I couldn't tell you. I don't give a damn. Because I'm out of it. I'm out of it. And I don't do television and I don't do interviews because the minute I said I would differ with Jeb or with George, you would have an obligation to rush down there and say, ''Your nutty father doesn't agree with you, what do you think?''</p>
