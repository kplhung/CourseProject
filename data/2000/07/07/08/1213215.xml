        <p>It will be one of the smallest fields of the year, but also one of the most distinguished, and it will take the stage tomorrow at Belmont: four colts will open the second half of the racing season in the Dwyer, a race that will propel one along the path toward the 3-year-old championship.</p>
        <p>At the draw yesterday, the rail was won by the Red Bullet, winner of the Preakness; No. 2 by Commendable, winner of the Belmont; No. 3 by More Than Ready, fourth in the Kentucky Derby, and the outside by Albert the Great, the swift rookie opening the second half of the season with the aim of overtaking the veterans of the Triple Crown.</p>
        <p>''I think I've got the best 3-year-old,'' said Joe Orseno, who trains Red Bullet. ''And he's going to prove it this summer.''</p>
        <p>Nick Zito, the trainer of Albert the Great, took the second-half perspective.</p>
        <p>''People get caught up with horses who win the classics,'' he said. ''There is still a long way to go and many races to be run before championships are decided.''</p>
        <p>The $150,000 Dwyer, to be run at a mile and a sixteenth, is the first major race of the second half.</p>
        <p>Red Bullet runs with one distinction that none of the others hold. In the Preakness, he out ran Fusaichi Pegasus, who won the Kentucky Derby and was presumed to be the star of the year. Red Bullet has not run since the Preakness.</p>
        <p>But in recent workouts, he has blazed away, speeding four furlongs in 49 2/5 secons and five furlongs in 59 2/5.</p>
        <p>''I didn't expect this race to be as tough as it came up,'' Orseno said. ''But we've had it marked on our schedule for some time. He's fresh and has grown physically since the Preakness.''</p>
        <p>Orseno concedes that he is worried about a colt as fast as More Than Ready. ''Red Bullet is at his best when he settles and comes with one run,'' he said. ''There is a possibility that More Than Ready can shake loose.''</p>
