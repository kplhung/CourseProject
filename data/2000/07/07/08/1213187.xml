        <p>In a world where globalization is often portrayed as a malevolent force, a career as a trade negotiator might not sound appealing. But Oystein Borsum disagrees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Borsum, 24, came from his home country, Norway, to make Egypt's case in a student debate over whether the World Trade Organization should be linking trade sanctions to standards that prohibit child labor.</p>
        <p>He had done his research, visiting the Egyptian Embassy in Oslo and finding information on the Internet, and he produced a paper that outlined the Egyptian view that punishing violators with trade sanctions would harm its emerging economy.</p>
        <p>After hours of negotiations in which students representing other countries, including the United States, argued opposing views, ''we were practically unable to agree on anything,'' Mr. Borsum said.</p>
        <p>''When we tried to get from the problem to the solution in the W.T.O. framework, we agreed to disagree,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Welcome to the real world, the adult advisers sighed.</p>
        <p>Some 50 students from two dozen countries ran into the same kinds of problems when they tried to find answers to half a dozen of the most sensitive trade issues, including child labor.</p>
        <p>The students, sequestered in a conference room in the W.T.O.'s stately building with spectacular views of Lake Geneva, concentrated on long and tough negotiations, oblivious to the perfect sunny weather outside.</p>
        <p>Tobias Fauser, 26, of Germany, who argued the American viewpoint, said he felt isolated. ''It is pretty hard to represent the United States because all the developing countries oppose linking labor standards to trade, and see this effort as a protectionist measure by Americans,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The debate took on an emotional quality when India, represented by Djana Gnjic of Yugoslavia, accused him of trying to impose American culture and values on other countries.</p>
        <p>''This is a solution that will make a poor country even poorer,'' Ms. Gnjic, 23, said. ''Children can't always go to school because their families can't afford it.''</p>
        <p>She said later that she felt somewhat beaten up. ''All the countries had a tough attitude, and no one wanted to let his ideas go,'' Ms. Gnjic said.</p>
        <p>Finally, with the arguments on a child-labor link really heated, the 12 students taking part decided to place a moratorium on even discussing the matter for seven years. Some delegates had wanted a 20-year blackout, but eventually compromised.</p>
        <p>The group, mostly business and economics students, did not sport the trappings of political radicals. Having come for the second Model W.T.O. 2000 -- an idea that the trade organization hopes to export to universities worldwide -- they wore jackets, ties and other businesslike attire. This ''contributed to the atmosphere and made negotiations more realistic,'' said Mathieu Regnier of Canada, a Geneva business student.</p>
        <p>Selected through competition, and subsidized by foundations, the group gathered in late May for four days of acting as trade negotiators to get the feeling of the real thing.</p>
        <p>Professing support for the concept of free trade, they were a far cry from the students who staged a sit-in here last November, chaining themselves to the W.T.O.'s main stairway, strewing confetti and paint, and chanting: ''The W.T.O. kills people. Death to the W.T.O.''</p>
        <p>The mock negotiators were able to spend some time with the World Trade Organization's director general, Mike Moore, who told them they were lucky that they did not have to ''go home and sell'' their trade proposals to their parliaments.</p>
        <p>By the end of the program, Friedericke Hesse of Germany said she had ''dropped my nationalistic glasses,'' adding, ''You see that other parts of the world have completely different points of view.''</p>
