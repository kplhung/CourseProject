        <p>A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., has overturned a criminal contempt citation against a reporter who disclosed details of a sealed legal settlement that was inadvertantly handed over by a court clerk.</p>
        <p>The reporter, Kirsten B. Mitchell, was following a lawsuit brought by residents of a trailer park in Wilmington, N.C. againt Conoco Inc., a company whose operations, they contended, were contaminating their water supply. When, in October 1997, a court clerk gave the reporter a group of documents, one of which was the $36 million settlement agreement, Ms. Mitchell used the material in an article published the next day in her newspaper, The Morning Star.</p>

        <p>A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., has overturned a criminal contempt citation against a reporter who disclosed details of a sealed legal settlement that was inadvertantly handed over by a court clerk.</p>
        <p>The reporter, Kirsten B. Mitchell, was following a lawsuit brought by residents of a trailer park in Wilmington, N.C. againt Conoco Inc., a company whose operations, they contended, were contaminating their water supply. When, in October 1997, a court clerk gave the reporter a group of documents, one of which was the $36 million settlement agreement, Ms. Mitchell used the material in an article published the next day in her newspaper, The Morning Star.</p>
        <p>Conoco's lawyers requested that the federal judge who originally sealed the document, W. Earl Britt, hold Ms. Mitchell and her colleague, Cory Reiss, who was also writing about the case and obtained information about the settlement from other sources, in contempt. The judge found Ms. Mitchell guilty of criminal contempt and also found her and the paper liable for civil contempt.</p>
        <p>Judge Britt upheld a demand from Conoco that Mr. Reiss should reveal his sources. When Mr. Reiss refused, Judge Britt held him in contempt and ordered him jailed - an order stayed by the appeals court.</p>
        <p>The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on Thursday overturned the conviction of Ms. Mitchell for criminal contempt of court. ''There is simply no evidence whatsoever'' that would allow the court ''to infer an intent to violate a court order or confidentiality,'' the judge wrote. The ruling added that the evidence ''all but confirms that Mitchell acted wholly innocently, and certainly innocently insofar as the law is concerned.</p>
        <p>The appeals court also reversed the contempt finding against Mr. Reiss. When Judge Britt originally sealed the settlement document, the appeals court held, he failed to follow required procedural steps and give interested parties, like newspapers, a chance to object.</p>
        <p>A third contempt citation against Ms. Mitchell and The Morning Star was voided under the same reasoning.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Sasser, the lawyer for Conoco, said yesterday that the appeals ruling ''will make litigation more cumbersome and expensive.''</p>
        <p>''Any time a party to a lawsuit wants to provide the court with a document that it considers confidential, whether it's a chemical formula that's a trade secret or the name of a child in a sexual assault case, the party must engage in a minitrial with the media,'' he continued.</p>
        <p>He added, ''I do think this additional layer of litigation will add to the delays inherent in court proceedings'' and increase public disrespect for the courts.</p>
        <p>George Freeman, an assistant general counsel for the New York Times Company, which owns the Wilmington newspaper, said yesterday that the decision ''confirms the long-held principle that the media cannot be punished for publishing truthful, newsworthy information which it legally obtains.''</p>
        <p>He added that the ruling ''emphasizes that judges can't willy-nilly seal court documents.''</p>
