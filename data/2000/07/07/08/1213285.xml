        <p>In a major setback for the Clinton administration's plan to build a missile shield to protect American soil from enemy attack, a missile fired from the Marshall Islands in the Pacific failed to hit a mock warhead launched 4,300 miles away in California.</p>
        <p>''We failed to achieve an intercept this evening,'' said Brian Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman.</p>
        <p>The last test, conducted in January, also ended in failure. In that case, the kill vehicle missed the mock warhead by between 300 to 400  feet after a cooling line clogged and shut down its heat-seeking sensors.</p>
        <p>At 12:19 a.m. today, a 37-year-old remodeled Minuteman rocket containing a mock warhead and a decoy balloon thundered aloft over the Pacific Ocean from a tightly guarded launching pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base, 125 miles north of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Twenty-one minutes after that, a 54-inch, 130-pound ''exoatmospheric kill vehicle'' was launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. Instead of guiding itself to a collision with the incoming mock warhead in midflight, it missed.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon gave no immediate details to explain the failure.</p>
        <p>Today's test was counted on to determine whether President Clinton proceeds with a plan to begin development of a $60 billion national missile defense that administration officials contend is crucial to defend against missile attacks from countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq. But opponents charge that such a system is technically unsound, unnecessary and a waste of money.</p>
        <p>Even though some senior Pentagon officials said a decision to move  forward was possible even if the test failed, today's miss will make it politically more difficult for Mr. Clinton to move forward with even the  most basic decision to issue contracts for pouring concrete for a radar guidance system in the Aleutian Islands. That move is under consideration even though many arms control experts insist that it would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile  Treaty.</p>
        <p>Because of harsh winter conditions in that area of Alaska, barges must  begin ferrying equipment by next spring if the radar is to be completed  by 2005, the date when the administration has concluded North Korea could have a ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States.</p>
        <p>The test failure is certain to reinforce calls in Congress that the  decision on whether to move forward with a national missile defense program should be left to the next president.</p>
        <p>The final analysis of what went wrong in today's test will take about  three to four weeks.</p>
        <p>In October, the Pentagon initially hailed its first intercept test as a  complete success. But it later was forced to acknowledge that the kill  vehicle initially had drifted off course and picked out the large bright decoy balloon instead of the mock warhead.</p>
        <p>In the second, more complicated intercept test, in January, the kill vehicle missed the mock warhead by between 300 to 400 feet after a cooling line clogged and shut down its heat-seeking sensors.</p>
        <p>Not since 1983, when President Reagan envisioned a defense based in space that would render nuclear weapons obsolete, has an issue of military technology seized the imagination of American policymakers and politicians and alarmed America's friends and foes.</p>
        <p>The issue has also entered the presidential campaign, with Vice President Al Gore endorsing a limited version of the plan and Gov. George W. Bush backing a more ambitious system that could be deployed in space.</p>
        <p>And it has raised a chorus of criticism from a sizable swath of scientists in the United States, some of whom argue that the proposed $60 billion system is not feasible and that the tests are rigged.</p>
        <p>The test had been scheduled to take place during a four-hour window that began late Friday night. But a last-minute technical problem set back the launching by about two hours. The problem was related to electronic signals that keep the ground control informed about the missile's flight.</p>
        <p>''Hitting a bullet with a bullet'' is how a Pentagon official described the hoped-for collision. ''Steel on target,'' another said.</p>
        <p>The three tests held so far are part of a series of 19 planned tests.</p>
        <p>After the failure of the test in January. a new communications system was added for today's test that transmits information directly to the kill vehicle about the location of the target after it has lifted off. Called a global-positioning-system transmitter, it used the same technology that helps motorists to avoid getting lost.</p>
        <p>Even before the failure today, critics said the new test was a misleading guide because it was taking place under conditions that do not reflect a real attack. They said the decoy was not a true decoy but was more like a lure that attracts the kill vehicle to the real target, and that an adversary would use many decoys, not one.</p>
        <p>In three or four weeks, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen is to give Mr. Clinton a formal recommendation of whether building the system is feasible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is expected to decide this fall whether to put America on the road to a national missile defense system by starting construction of the radar in the Aleutian Islands.</p>
        <p>Administration lawyers have advised Mr. Clinton that in their view, he could begin building this first phase of the missile defense without violating the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, one of the cornerstones of arms control agreements between Washington and Moscow.</p>
        <p>But the administration has been hit by a storm of criticism from prominent scientists, arms control experts, former officials and the General Accounting Office over the cost, technology and effect on relations with other nations.</p>
        <p>Lawrence J. Korb of the Council on Foreign Relations called the entire system a ''shield of dreams'' whose supporters believe that ''if you build it, it will work.''</p>
        <p>Even within the administration, a debate is raging among intelligence and Pentagon officials and policy experts over the nature and extent of the potential threat from countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq that is the official justification for building a missile shield. Some senior Pentagon officials have warned that the administration's schedule is much too accelerated and therefore risky, because testing would continue even as construction has begun.</p>
        <p>Russia and China are adamantly opposed to an American missile defense because they consider it a threat to their ability to defend themselves. European nations are also  distressed that the United States would take such a position without regard to Europe's security.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to stop the test, Greenpeace, the anti-nuclear organization, said a small team of missile defense opponents entered the grounds of Vandenberg Air Force Base on foot. Equipped with survival gear and supplies for several days, they intended to stay inside the area as long as they could, according to a Greenpeace statement.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Dutch vessel Arctic Sunrise threatened to enter one of the hazard zones designated by the Pentagon in the waters off Vandenberg.</p>
        <p>An unidentified man was caught entering the base, but a base spokesman, John Cherry, said there was no evidence of intruders in the heavily guarded area around the launching pad.</p>
        <p>At a news briefing in Washington on Friday, a group of business leaders and scientists weighed in with 11-hour criticism of both the test and the entire plan.</p>
        <p>''Stop this insensate and tortuously rationalized arms race that drains money away from our vital civilian programs,'' said Alan Kligerman, the chief executive officer of Akpharma Inc., and a board member of Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, which seeks to cut military spending. He added: ''If I would represent my products and sell them with the same shortcomings in the products as regard to what they are supposed to do, I would be indicted.''</p>
        <p>Bruce Blair, president of Center for Defense Information, argued at the same briefing that the development of a national missile defense was justifiably seen by Russia as a threat to its nuclear deterrent.</p>
