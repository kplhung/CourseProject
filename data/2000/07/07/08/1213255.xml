        <p>Canada's job market was surprisingly weak in June, with a net loss of more than 14,000 jobs, although the unemployment rate remained steady at 6.6 percent because of a comparable drop in the number of people seeking work. The decline in the labor force, the first since January 1998, was most evident in manufacturing, construction and agriculture, where more than 40,000 jobs were lost. Economists expect a modest recovery in employment in the next few months, but the reversal in June ''clearly supports the view that the economy is slowing alongside the cooling U.S. growth engine,'' said John McCallum, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada.</p>
