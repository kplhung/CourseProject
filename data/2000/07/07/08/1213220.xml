        <p>There were drive-by shootings that jangled the nerves of the residents who flinched through life in Compton, Calif., but the sound that still lingers in the head of Venus Williams has nothing to do with gang grudges.</p>
        <p>For a spindly child who was barely bigger than her racket handle, there was nothing better to perk up Williams's ears than the faint music-box jingle from the ice-cream truck rambling toward the tennis courts.</p>
        <p>''Sure, you know, maybe living in Compton isn't like the most desired place to live, not in the top 100,'' Williams said with a sly smile after her semifinal victory against her sister, Serena, on Thursday. ''But I had a great time. I still miss the ice-cream trucks. They had the best ice-cream trucks. Spent all my allowance on the ice-cream trucks.''</p>
        <p>She's a grownup now. And with nearly $5 million in career earnings, she is a 20-year-old who has made the leap from Dreamsicles to strawberries and cream. After an improbable rise with the aid of her father's unorthodox ways, she is in position to make history. If Williams can counter the power of the defending champion Lindsay Davenport on Saturday, she will become the first African-American woman after Althea Gibson in 1957-58 to win Wimbledon. And if she captures this title, Venus will join her sister Serena as a Grand Slam winner. No sisters in tennis history have each won Grand Slam titles.</p>
        <p>''We don't go on no 'ifs,' like 'If this happens,' '' Richard Williams said after signing autographs on the grounds today. ''We're here to make things happen. We're here to set any kind of history for anyone who wants to see history. I understand Althea Gibson won a singles title here, and we're here to follow in the footsteps she laid.''</p>
        <p>Davenport could be the snag in the grand plan.</p>
        <p>Beneath the hype whirling around every move made by the Williams sisters and every word uttered by their father, Davenport has just blended into the colorful scene.</p>
        <p>No one would know it from the bravado and confidence gushing from the Williams family, but Davenport has handled Venus over the years, winning nine of the 12 matches they've played.</p>
        <p>''I've played her a lot in the past, and a lot of times I found the key was, you know, find a way to get her serve back,'' Davenport said. ''You have to get them back deep so she obviously doesn't have put-away shots.''</p>
        <p>Venus Williams craves the soft, short floaters off her opponents' return. Her favorite shot is the swinging forehand volley, a weapon she used to dismantle top-ranked Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals. She also put away her little sister with it on occasion during the semifinals.</p>
        <p>And today, the awkwardness of the sisters' semifinal was over.</p>
        <p>''It was not easy,'' said Richard Williams, who did not watch the match but was there to console Serena. ''I went home with Serena. You could see the tears in her eyes. She hates to lose.''</p>
        <p>This afternoon, the smile was back for Serena Williams after she laughed, joked and shared a doubles triumph with her big sister. Together, they advanced to the women's doubles final after defeating Anna Kournikova and Natasha Zvereva in straight sets. And with that, the Williams sisters became the first African-American team to reach the doubles final at Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>''It's been a great tournament,'' Richard Williams said. ''It's been phenomenal for the family. I think if Venus is serious, no one can touch her.''</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Venus Williams had a chance to take the United States Open title long before her little sister won it last summer. But at age 17, she wasn't savvy enough to beat Hingis.</p>
        <p>''That was my third Grand Slam to play in,'' Venus Williams said. ''I wasn't even full-time on the Tour. I didn't understand any strategy as far as, let's say you're down a breakpoint, and maybe you should get your first serve in. Things like that never came to my mind. It was totally different circumstances, yeah. It's extremely different from now.''</p>
        <p>Now, everything has changed.</p>
        <p>''She's come so far,'' Richard Williams said. ''The first day I took Venus out there on the courts, I knew she was a champion. The reason I knew it was that I was working with three other girls who were much older than she was. And I had a shopping cart with 550 balls in there. And those three girls were taking so long to hit them. I had to patronize them to get them to do it. Venus never wanted to stop.</p>
        <p>''If you stopped her, she'd start crying. It got to the last ball, and she'd say, 'Say, last ball.' To this day, I still say, 'last ball' to her.''</p>
        <p>In what seems like an instant, Venus Williams has gone from the gangly child in Compton to the statuesque center of attention at Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>''You know it's my life,'' she said. ''The whole time I've had a great time. I've had a great life.''</p>
