        <p>The Bosnian government bridled today at a report to the United States Congress that said crime and corruption were blocking the success of the Dayton peace accord. Bosnian officials insisted that the government itself was pursuing investigations of local government corruption and tackling smuggling.</p>
        <p>An adviser to President Alija Izetbegovic did not deny that corruption exists among the three ethnic entities in Bosnia, but defended government efforts to crack down on it. ''Things are being done -- dozens, even hundreds of cases are being investigated,'' said Mirza Hajric, the adviser. ''The president has made lots of statements on this issue.''</p>
        <p>The report, released by the General Accounting Office in Washington today and reported in The New York Times on Thursday, blamed the local authorities in Bosnia for failing to eliminate corruption and build a state of law in the four years since the war ended. The Dayton  agreement, which the G.A.O. report said was being undercut, was signed in 1995 by Croatia, Yugoslavia and Bosnia's three major ethnic groups as a framework for rebuilding a self-sustaining multiethnic Bosnia.</p>
        <p>In its report, the G.A.O, the investigative arm of Congress, suggested that the Clinton administration should consider suspending its aid until the Bosnian authorities show that they are committed to fighting the abuses.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hajric responded that the Bosnian government had worked to cooperate with the international bodies and peacekeepers in the country. ''You would not find one element that we are not cooperating on, but we are only halfway through a five-year transition,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Government officials, and some of the international officials working here, stressed that anticorruption programs depend on fundamental reforms to the judicial system and law enforcement bodies. They said that such changes take time and effort, and need at least several years to take full effect.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Office of the High Representative, the highest civilian authority in Bosnia, pointed to some successes, or at least signs of progress. They noted the creation of a countrywide customs service that is now working, and the financial police and prosecutors who are starting to work with their counterparts in other ethnic entities.</p>
        <p>They said customs revenues were finally up because officials were closing loopholes that allowed goods to travel into Bosnia through one entity with few checks as to its destination. Stolen cars, illegal cigarettes and other goods have been arriving in Bosnia for years with the government unable to collect excise duties.</p>
        <p>The high representative, Wolfgang Petritsch, stressed that efforts to combat corruption would work only when there was a political breakthrough. ''I am convinced it will continue,'' he said of corruption, ''as long as there are no central state institutions or rule of law and while we have not fully broken the vested interests of the nationalist parties.''</p>
