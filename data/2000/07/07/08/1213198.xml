        <p>Boom times are the worst thing ever to have hit New York's Chinatown. Twenty-five years ago, New York needed Chinatown. The city was on the brink of bankruptcy, and many neighborhoods were declining. Chinatown was a rare area of growing prosperity in the tight times, emerging from an area occupying few city blocks to transform a dilapidated Lower East Side into a thriving community.</p>
        <p>And now that things are good, New York seems to care little about its old friend, turning its attention instead to Silicon Alley entrepreneurs and Wall Street barons. Chinatown has stagnated in the past several years, hurt by rising rents, aggressive enforcement of old city laws and a digital divide.</p>
        <p>Chinatown's economy, now as in the past, depends largely on a core of small businesses in mature and declining industries: small-scale manufacturing, much of it in the garment industry; restaurants that specialize in Chinese cuisine; retail and wholesale trade; tourism and gift shops. We in Chinatown need the city's help in both preserving our traditional businesses and generating more modern ones.</p>
        <p>The garment industry, which once employed 30,000 people in Chinatown, has been hardest hit. Foreign competition, low-cost production overseas and occasional charges of sweatshop operations have driven manufacturers away from Chinatown: its garment factories have decreased from 500 to less than 300. This decline has had a multiplier effect as lost income in the community has sent sales plunging in other businesses. Now garment factories struggle to pay $10 to $12 a square foot for loft space in Chinatown while dot-com companies, which are edging in from the outside, would gladly pay double or triple that. Some provision should be made to keep at least some buildings operating with affordable rents.</p>
        <p>Senator Charles Schumer has appointed a task force of prominent business leaders, known as the Group of 35, to find more commercial space in the city for growing companies. Perhaps a representative of a small business or manufacturing industry should be appointed to this task force, too, to reflect more diverse business needs.</p>
        <p>Lower Manhattan's residential boom has also hurt Chinatown. In the 1980's and 1990's, the upscale development that started in SoHo began to to hem Chinatown in, causing economic and cultural clashes. The sidewalk fish and vegetable stalls that most New Yorkers once saw as quaint are viewed by some of our new neighbors as dirty and smelly inconveniences. The wholesale trades of poultry and groceries, with their early morning deliveries and congestion on the sidewalks, are seen as a nuisance.</p>
        <p>Appeals have been made to the local community boards to restrict certain business operations. The Police Department and Department of Consumer Affairs have dusted off all the rule books, ticketing sidewalk vendors for all types of violations that had not been enforced in decades and, in some cases, are still not enforced elsewhere. Not long ago, the city unearthed a quarter-century-old Little Italy special zoning district, limiting types of businesses and setting requirements for stores, and attempted to force merchants to comply with its rules and regulations  -- in an area where properties have been more than 90 percent Chinese-owned and Chinese-occupied for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>Of course, Chinatown's own entrepreneurs must recognize the need to modernize. Within New York's Asian-American community, a yawning digital divide has appeared. National studies show that Asian-Americans as a group have the highest computer ownership and Internet connection rates for any ethnic group in the United States, but a recent survey by the Asian American Business Development Center found a different picture in Chinatown. Although 85 percent of the small businesses that responded use computers, most of those are outdated and cannot be connected to the Internet. Most Chinatown entrepreneurs don't yet fully appreciate the need to develop educational and economic resources to turn around declining businesses.</p>
        <p>What's most important for the preservation of Chinatown, however, is a recognition by the city itself that this neighborhood is an endangered asset. The City Planning Commission should study how best to preserve Chinatown, whose special character has always been a point of municipal pride. Our city's leaders should recognize, too, that by helping to sustain New York in difficult years, Chinatown helped lay the foundation for today's boom.</p>
