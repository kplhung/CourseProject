        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A July 3 letter writer objects to Bob Herbert's reference to a possible repeal of the estate tax as a ''handout'' to the very wealthy (column, June 26) and asks if a family's wealth belongs to the government. The answer is that some of it does.</p>
        <p>There will always be contentious debate over what constitutes fair levels of taxation, but it is impossible to deny the essential government claim on private wealth without negating the very notion of civilization.</p>

        <p>There will always be contentious debate over what constitutes fair levels of taxation, but it is impossible to deny the essential government claim on private wealth without negating the very notion of civilization.</p>
        <p>As citizens, we finance our government to secure, as the Constitution says, not simply the blessings of liberty but also justice, domestic tranquillity, the common defense and the general welfare.</p>
        <p>The cost of government is the cost of civilization.</p>
