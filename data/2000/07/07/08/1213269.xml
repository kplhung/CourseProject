        <p>The last time he faced the Yankees, Bobby J. Jones was in the depths of his worst slump. It was all new for him, and it was not fun.</p>
        <p>''I don't remember the last time in my career when I struggled like I did early this year, dating back to high school and college,'' the 30-year-old Jones said yesterday. He is scheduled to face Dwight Gooden at Shea Stadium in the first game of today's day-night doubleheader.</p>
        <p>''I mean, I was always a pretty decent player. I never had to go through a period where I struggled.''</p>
        <p>Jones, who was battered for nine hits and seven runs in less than five innings when he lost to the Yankees in June, found his way to the minors. He accepted a temporary assignment to Class AAA Norfolk after that start, adjusted his mechanics to improve the downward movement on his fastball, and has a 2-0 record and a 2.25 earned run average in three starts since.</p>
        <p>In eight starts before going to Norfolk, the right-hander was 1-3 with a 10.19 E.R.A.</p>
        <p>''This is an improved product,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''He's still got the same stuff. I think he's throwing it with better command, and he has a better tempo and rhythm when he's out there right now.''</p>
        <p>Jones will use the same game plan today he used the last time he faced the Yankees. It did not work then, but Jones said he simply needs to minimize his mistakes.</p>
        <p>Then again, sometimes a pitcher can only do so much. With two outs in the first inning against the Yankees, Jones threw a wicked curveball to Tino Martinez, who golfed it to the warning track for a run-scoring double.</p>
        <p>''You have to give credit to good hitters,'' he said. ''Good pitches are going to get hit. But it all evens out.''</p>
        <p>It has for Jones, who has a 3-3 record. The Mets' starter for the second game, Glendon Rusch, is 6-6, though he has pitched well. Rusch has allowed three earned runs or fewer in 10 of his 14 starts, working at least six innings each time. Pitching for the Kansas City Royals, Rusch faced the Yankees frequently, never with success.</p>
        <p>He is 0-5 against the Yankees in his career, with an 8.90 E.R.A. Yankee Stadium, where Rusch will face Roger Clemens tonight, inspired awe.</p>
        <p>''There's definitely a mystique with the amount of world championships they've won, and they've had a great team over the last few years,'' Rusch said. ''Coming in with a young team like Kansas City, it can be intimidating at times if you're not used to the league, used to playing in Yankee Stadium. Fortunately for me, I got that out of the way because I've already pitched over there a couple of times.''</p>
