        <p>As people across the country line up at bookstores to buy J. K. Rowling's fourth Harry Potter adventure, untold numbers of would-be Rowlings are sitting at home feverishly typing, trying to turn out a best-selling children's book, hoping that it will become a children's classic. Many if not most of them assume that writing children's books is simple -- easier, surely, than writing for adults.</p>
        <p>Wrong. Very wrong.</p>
        <p>As those who do it best have testified, writing well for children is, first and last, very difficult. Adults who read ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' as children remember the images of blue-jacketed bunnies hopping through the cabbages in Mr. McGregor's garden as sweet and funny, but children generally grasp the fact that Beatrix Potter was writing about life and death. Moreover, as memoirs and biographies have shown, the great children's works have often been the products of personal difficulty and stress, a narrative distillation of anguished experience.</p>
        <p>Many critics have observed the central role of outsiders in children's literature. The heroes are typically underdogs, youngest children, orphans or, like Harry Potter, some combination of these. To be sure, there have been many cheerful storytellers who have beguiled young readers with what the biographer and critic Leonard Marcus has called ''innocent thoughts, and happy endings, and little more than that.'' But the masterpieces, those often tough tales people chew over long after they turn out the lights, are commonly survivor literature, both for the teller and the tale.</p>
        <p>Thanks to modern scholarship, we know that many of the 19th- and early-20th-century greats were beset by trauma. There was Hans Christian Andersen, broody and reclusive, and Louisa May Alcott, who romanticized the confusion of her own childhood in the self-portrait of Jo in ''Little Women.'' Lewis Carroll's obsession with little girls has become a staple of academic commentary, discussed in greater detail than almost any reader of ''Alice in Wonderland'' would ever want or need. And Beatrix Potter's diaries show us a young woman determined to resist the stifling environment of her boorish, wealthy family. As the novelist and critic Alison Lurie has put it, Potter ''escaped from prison with the help of a rabbit'' -- Peter Rabbit.</p>
        <p>A glance at a shelf of modern classic titles for children from babyhood to early adolescence indicates how little has changed. Those who tell the tales that endure have struggled. Many contemporary writers whose best-known work is deceptively lighthearted have written troubling, even depressing, memoirs.</p>
        <p>In ''Boy,'' published for children, and ''Going Solo,'' for children and adults, Roald Dahl set out his childhood in terms as stark as any fairy tale. Although his biographer, Jeremy Treglown, has demonstrated that Mr. Dahl exaggerated and misstated some points, the reality of his boarding school misery -- the cruel teachers, wicked shopkeepers and nasty pranks -- and of his strangely intense relationship with his widowed Norwegian mother remain unmistakably disturbing. For many children and adults Ramona Quimby is the quintessential modern American heroine of early-grade fiction. Beverly Cleary's affectionate family novels about Ramona, her sister Beezus, her parents and her friends on Klickitat Street are beloved as much for their characters' ability to deal calmly with misfortune as for their accounts of comic mishap. Cleary's sunny prose seems to have been hard won because in her two memoirs, ''A Girl from Yamhill'' and ''My Own Two Feet,'' written for older children and adults, she recounts a fairly grim childhood in Portland, Ore., during the Depression. The strain of living through hard times with a severe, demanding mother who never hugged or spoke of loving her is set out plainly.</p>
        <p>Transforming early childhood stress can take many forms. Everyone today understands that Maurice Sendak's ''Where the Wild Things Are'' is about early childhood temper tantrums, but when it was published in 1963 it was stunningly new and was quickly understood in Freudian terms. Mr. Sendak, who spent many years in psychoanalysis, has explained that the book's fanged creatures were, in fact, his relatives in Brooklyn who came for his mother's Sunday dinners and patronized the children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sendak has also described the frightening impact on him, as on so many others raised in the 1930's, of the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh's baby son. It was one of the explicit sources for his lushly illustrated and alarming tale of Ida and her baby sister, ''Outside Over There.''</p>
        <p>Katherine Paterson, the internationally acclaimed novelist whose fiction has ranged widely from feudal China and Japan to the Industrial Revolution in 19th-century Vermont, has been open about the painful experiences that inspired two of her most widely admired contemporary novels. ''The Great Gilly Hopkins'' emerged from a brief spell as a foster parent. The 1978 Newbery Medal novel, ''The Bridge to Terabithia,'' now considered a classic, is about an improbable but powerful friendship between a boy named Jess and a girl named Leslie.</p>
        <p>Young readers often find themselves sobbing over the section of the novel after Leslie's accidental death. Accepting the Newbery Medal, Mrs. Paterson explained that the book was her way of dealing with the death of a friend of one of her sons and with her own recovery from cancer.</p>
        <p>The sustained popularity of Gary Paulsen's 1987 novel ''Hatchet,'' about a 13-year-old boy who spends 54 days alone in the Canadian wilderness with only a hatchet for a tool, along with its sequels, ''The River,'' ''Brian's Winter'' and ''Brian's Return,'' leaves it poised to become a children's classic. Mr. Paulsen's prose is Hemingway-terse, and his plots tend to involve tests of endurance.</p>
        <p>He has talked about his miserable childhood with alcoholic and abusive parents. As a boy he spent much of his time escaping -- staying with relatives, building himself a hiding place in the cellar behind the furnace, fleeing into the woods. ''Whenever I went into the woods, all the hassles of life were very quickly forgotten,'' he has said.</p>
        <p>And what of Jo Rowling? The story of a young divorced mum on the dole, sitting in Edinburgh cafes with her infant daughter and writing out ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' in 1994 is legend. It omits the fact that she'd begun sketches for some characters as early as 1976, when she was a teenager, and continued working on them steadily thereafter; the Harry Potter character came into her mind more than five years before the first novel was finished. In its sketchy portrayal of a difficult life, the legend is not wrong; it just skips over the 10-year struggle of Ms. Rowling's mother with multiple sclerosis before her death in 1990 at age 45, Ms. Rowling's bad marriage to a television journalist, her bouts of depression and the very hard work that went into plotting the world of Hogwarts.</p>
        <p>It takes a full generation for a book, no matter how successful, to shift into classic status, and the jury has not even gone out on the unfolding Harry Potter. Time will tell. For the moment it's a phenomenon. But hard work, luck and travails like those of Ms. Rowling may be the stuff of which a children's classic is made.</p>
