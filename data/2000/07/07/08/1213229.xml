        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed the creation of tax credits and other federal financing to stimulate job growth among small businesses in this upstate region today on the second day of a tour that is celebrating her first year of campaigning for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>In a speech this afternoon before the Rotary Club, Mrs. Clinton called for a tax credit of up to $3,000 per employee for small businesses that set up operations in communities losing population -- like many she is visiting on this campaign swing.</p>
        <p>In her remarks to about 300 people at a club luncheon, as well as at an earlier appearance in nearby Elmira, Mrs. Clinton highlighted economic issues in a region that has been considered a Republican stronghold.</p>
        <p>She called for more federal funds to develop and improve highways in western New York as well as for  airlines to bring more frequent, and and less expensive, air service to this region.</p>
        <p>''I will do everything possible to entice some airlines to look more closely at the regional airports,'' she said. ''It's a very big challenge and we have to be vigilant.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, she continued her attacks on Representative Rick A. Lazio for a fund-raising letter sent this week by his campaign. In the letter, Mr. Lazio said Mrs. Clinton and President Clinton had ''embarrassed our country and disgraced their powerful posts.'' He has said that he did not see the letter before it was sent but that he stood by it.</p>
        <p>''I think that is a perfect example of how he tries to be all things to all people,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''And it's part of the typical political double talk that's marked his campaign.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton began her day in Ithaca, where she walked through the Commons, a business district, and visited a coffee shop. And she went on to attend an outdoor rally in Elmira organized by labor groups and Democratic Party officials. As in many of her campaign stops, Mrs. Clinton continued to evoke strong passions from onlookers, garnering a large share of cheers and protests. Today's appearance in Ithaca drew an especially vocal group of protesters, complaining of the continuation of the Navy's bombing on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.</p>
        <p>Amid the Democratic faithful at both stops were groups of protesters holding signs reading ''Stand by Your Man . . . in Arkansas'' as well as far cruder slogans.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters, Mrs. Clinton said that she was not bothered by such protesting. ''People have hundreds of millions of opinions,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''And I have no problem with anybody expressing their opinions in a civil way. It doesn't bother me. It's part of the political process.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mrs. Clinton departed from her typical pattern of riding in a van with her staff and security detail by boarding the bus carrying the reporters covering her campaign. For the 20-minute ride from Ithaca to Elmira, she spoke with the reporters, reflecting on the year since she formed an exploratory committee to run for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>''This has been a great experience for me,'' she said, referring to her first attempt at gaining elective office. ''I had to learn how to be a candidate. I sure have tried to be more effective at becoming a candidate, which is something I'd never done before.''</p>
        <p>When asked whether the highly negative tone of the protesters' placards gave her pause, she said: ''Oh, they are amateurs. I have been down this road for so many years. Even before I was married to Bill Clinton, people had strong opinions about me. And it hasn't changed ever since I was a little girl and I don't expect it to change any time before the end of this election. It is just part of the background music of my life.''</p>
