        <p>Dan Solomon letter replies to Thomas Lynch's July 5 Op-Ed article on a man's inability to sever his financial responsibility for a child he does not want to be born</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Why oughtn't my sons have an equivalent choice -- say, within the first two trimesters -- to declare their decision not to parent, to void their paternity?'' Thomas Lynch asks (Op-Ed, July 5). ''Is biology destiny, after all?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch disregards one important fact. If his daughter chooses to terminate her (hypothetical) pregnancy, any responsibility for the potential offspring vanishes. If his son was able to legally terminate his interest in the pregnancy of someone else's daughter, the responsibility for that offspring would remain.</p>

        <p>No longer legally required from the father in the form of ''fiscal responsibility for 18 years,'' the entire burden could freely be loaded upon that daughter's shoulders -- shoulders that continue to have less earning power than their male equivalents. His sons can't have an equivalent choice until society renders the situation an equivalent one.</p>
