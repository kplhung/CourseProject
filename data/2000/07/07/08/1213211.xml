        <p>The Democrats released a draft of their party platform today that strongly articulates the centrist ''new Democratic'' views of Vice President Al Gore, but also offers concessions to liberals on several major issues, including trade, the death penalty and gay rights.</p>
        <p>In many ways, the 41-page document tries to straddle the same ideological divide that faces Mr. Gore in his quest for the presidency. Even as he tries to reach out to moderate and independent voters this fall, Mr. Gore will need to energize core Democratic voters, who tend to be more liberal.</p>
        <p>On many major issues, the platform stakes out the centrist views first championed by President Clinton in 1992. It calls for fiscal discipline and paying off the national debt by 2012. It proposes modest tax cuts. It advocates more accountability for schools and teachers. It views global trade as crucial to economic prosperity. It endorses tougher penalties, including the death penalty, for violent criminals.</p>
        <p>But on many of those issues, the draft platform -- which will be completed at a meeting in Cleveland later this month -- also includes provisions intended to mitigate the concerns of liberals.</p>
        <p>For example, on trade, potentially the most divisive issue for the party, the 2000 platform includes significantly stronger language than the 1996 platform about protecting workers and the environment against the potential downsides of globalization.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore will insist on and use the authority to enforce worker rights, human rights and environmental protections'' in trade accords, it says. ''We should use trade to lift up standards around the world, not drag down standards here at home.''</p>
        <p>In another tradeoff with labor, the document supports giving the president broad powers to negotiate trade agreements, a policy known as fast track that is strongly opposed by unions. But it also endorses legislation prohibiting the permanent replacement of workers on strike.</p>
        <p>In another section, the platform asserts that more police officers and tougher penalties, including capital punishment, have helped reduce crime. But it will also include language advocating that people facing the death sentence have access to DNA testing and adequate counsel.</p>
        <p>The crime-fighting section includes another plank sought by minorities: the condemnation of racial profiling by police officers.</p>
        <p>In a section with the centrist-sounding title ''Valuing our families,'' the platform will say that the party ''supports the full inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life of a nation.'' The provision is intended to suggest that the party supports civil unions for gay couples, though perhaps not religious ones.</p>
        <p>Where the platform adopts Republican-sounding ideas, it usually criticizes the Republican version of those ideas. On tax cuts, for instance, the platform advocates reductions for ''working parents.'' But it harshly attacks Gov. George W. Bush's proposed across-the-board tax cut with populist language.</p>
        <p>''It would let the richest 1 percent of Americans afford a new sports car and middle class Americans afford a warm soda,'' the platform says.</p>
        <p>The draft also echoes Mr. Gore's  attacks on Mr. Bush's proposal to let  taxpayers invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market.</p>
        <p>''Taken together, George W. Bush's $2 trillion tax cut, his campaign-season spending proposals, his support for privatizing Social Security add up to an assault on the surplus, causing Americans to have to choose between drastic cuts in education and health care or a return to the days of deficit spending,'' the draft reads.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the platform highlights Mr. Gore's core campaign proposals to preserve Social Security, expand health care, help the elderly buy prescription drugs, overhaul the campaign finance system and strengthen gun regulations.</p>
        <p>And it devotes it largest section to Mr. Gore's education proposals.</p>
        <p>On foreign policy, the platform calls for increasing military pay, enacting the Comprehensive Test Ban  Treaty and creating a limited national missile defense system capable of defending against attacks from North Korea or the Middle East.</p>
        <p>In its language as well as its policies, the document echoes Mr. Gore's stump speeches. It is divided into three major sections -- prosperity, progress and peace -- which were the themes of a recent campaign swing by the vice president. It paraphrases the title of Mr. Gore's book on the environment, saying, ''The Earth truly is in the balance.''</p>
        <p>And it closes with a pet Gore slogan: ''Now, we say to America, 'You ain't seen nothing yet.' ''</p>
