        <p>New York's Family Court engages in an especially daunting exercise in balancing interests as it confronts cases in which Administration for Children's Services seeks to remove children from their homes because one of their parents has been physically abused by the other; Judge Clark V Richardson, who handles such cases in Bronx, says it usually means that children can be taken from a mother on ground that she is failing to protect them from danger, even though she may have done nothing wrong or negligent and simply lacks financial or emotional resources to leave an abusive partner; cases reflect an unintended consequence of new understanding of how a child can be scarred by seeing one parent beat the other and of how domestic violence can sometimes be part of a package of dysfunction at home, a red flag for egregious forms of child abuse and neglect; women's advocates who are challenging agency in court argue that overzealous application of the law punishes the victim and discourages a battered spouse from taking action against the abuser; photo (M)</p>

        <p>As the supervising judge in Bronx Family Court, Judge Clark V. Richardson spends most days presiding over one arduous decision after another -- when to sever a mother's legal ties to her child, when to throw a teenage troublemaker behind bars.</p>
        <p>But these days there is a particularly vexing category of cases on his docket: Judge Richardson handles all of the cases in the Bronx when the city's child welfare agency has removed children from their homes because, in essence, one of their parents has been the victim of domestic abuse.</p>
        <p>The city can take children into foster care if a parent is believed to ''engage in acts of domestic violence.'' Its authority to do so was strengthened by a 1998 state court ruling that declared incidents of domestic violence in the presence of a child to be sufficient grounds for a charge of neglect.</p>
        <p>In practice, Judge Richardson said, that usually means that a mother who is a victim of abuse can be accused of failing to protect her children from danger. Often, she may have done nothing wrong or negligent, but simply lacked the financial or emotional resources to leave an abusive partner.</p>
        <p>In such cases, it falls to Judge Richardson, and other Family Court judges across the state, to decide whether those mothers get their children back, and under what terms. After all, he and other child welfare experts acknowledge, abusive partners can frequently be players in the most tragic cases of child abuse.</p>
        <p>And so for Judge Richardson, who deals daily with disputes of law and love, violence and poverty, these cases present an especially daunting exercise in balancing interests.</p>
        <p>''What is difficult is that you're victimizing them twice,'' he said of the mothers. ''On the other hand, you have the notion of protecting the children. And they are not necessarily consistent.''</p>
        <p>He cited two recent examples: in both, the city had taken custody of children after a violent fight between their parents. And in both, the women implored him to send their children back home.</p>
        <p>In the first, a woman with a black eye stood before him, claiming to have hurt herself by banging into a refrigerator. Her husband sounded belligerent. Their 13-year-old daughter insisted she had never witnessed any domestic violence at home. The judge suspected she had been coached.</p>
        <p>In the second case, a woman appeared alone, her arms pocked with bruises, her face glazed by weariness. She told the judge of being terrified of her husband. She agreed to move, to take her children someplace where he would never find them.</p>
        <p>In both cases, the judge, who under a pilot program sees all such cases in the Bronx, ultimately allowed the  children to return home, but only after being assured that the women would make use of counseling and other support services, he said. In the first case, he waited a month, until the couple acknowledged that there had been a problem with violence in the home.</p>
        <p>In some ways, these cases reflect an unintended consequence of new and arguably enlightened perspectives on domestic violence. It is now widely acknowledged that watching adults fight at home -- and especially witnessing a parent being beaten -- can scar children forever. Moreover, domestic violence can sometimes be part of a package of dysfunction at home, a red flag for egregious forms of child abuse and neglect.</p>
        <p>''We know there's a close correlation between domestic violence and child abuse,'' Nicholas Scoppetta, commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, said in an interview. ''Very often where there's physical abuse of children, there's also domestic violence in the home;  in particular, when there's an unrelated male in the home.''</p>
        <p>Which is why, Mr. Scoppetta said, caseworkers routinely inquire into domestic violence. The fact that one parent is abused, he asserted, should not be the sole reason to remove their children, but if the victim resists taking the steps necessary to protect the children -- by failing to keep the batterer away, for instance, or refusing to move to a safe place -- the children should be removed for their safety.</p>
        <p>Agency officials said they did not keep figures on how many children were removed principally because of domestic violence.</p>
        <p>''It's a judgment call on the part of caseworkers,'' Mr. Scoppetta said. ''I would hope they would make that call only when there's evidence that the child is in imminent danger.''</p>
        <p>''Do we always get it right?'' he asked. ''I suspect it doesn't always happen.''</p>
        <p>Some women's advocates contend that the agency often does not get it right. A class-action lawsuit has recently been filed claiming that the city violates the due process rights of parents who have been victims of domestic violence by removing their children.</p>
        <p>Instead of punishing the perpetrator, these advocates say, an overzealous application of the law ends up punishing the victim. Fear of that prospect can keep victims of domestic violence from taking action against their batterers, they say. And just as it can hurt children to watch a parent being abused, they add, it can also hurt them to be suddenly taken from that parent's care.</p>
        <p>They offer the example of women like Sharlene Tillett, who was accused of exposing her child to domestic violence even though the child had not yet been born. Ms. Tillett, 29, was pregnant with her second child last year when the baby's father, her  former boyfriend, from whom she had already separated, came to her apartment one night and, in a bout of anger, began pummeling her.</p>
        <p>It was not the first time he had assaulted her, she said, but it would be the last. She had decided, she said, to move to California, where she had family, after the baby was born.</p>
        <p>Those plans unraveled the day she gave birth to a healthy baby boy, whom she named Uganda. When a social worker at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center asked about domestic violence as part of a routine questionnaire, Ms. Tillett said, she answered candidly.</p>
        <p>The next day, in a move that she soon realized was a grave mistake, she agreed to let the baby's father, Jamie Gray, take them home from the hospital.</p>
        <p>City records indicate that the social worker filed a complaint to the state central register on child abuse and neglect. The next day, child welfare caseworkers, accompanied by police officers, carried away her 2-day-old son.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tillett was charged with child neglect. ''The respondents engage in acts of domestic violence in the presence of the subject child,'' the caseworker's report said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tillett was also charged with not having a crib for the baby. It did not help, she said, when she explained she was planning to move to California. She had a plane ticket in hand, she said.</p>
        <p>It took Ms. Tillett 7 weeks to get Uganda back, as well as 19 weeks of court-ordered workshops for domestic violence victims, 10 hours of classes on being a good parent and counseling once a week. She now lives in a homeless shelter for battered women. The city child welfare agency is monitoring her case.</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Tillett, Sharwline Nicholson said she was wholly unprepared for the arrival of the child welfare agency in her life. She, too, had separated from the father of her second child. He had never been violent until one wintry afternoon last year, when in an apparent fit of jealousy, she said, he went to her Brooklyn apartment unexpectedly, hurled whatever was in sight, and kicked and hit her so severely that her arm was broken.  The baby, Destinee, was sleeping in another room; her 6-year-old son, Kendell, was in school.</p>
        <p>The former boyfriend, Claude Barnett, fled. When the police and paramedics arrived, Ms. Nicholson said, she asked a neighbor who frequently watched her children to baby-sit until her cousin could pick them up later that day. Knowing her children would be safe, she said, she slept peacefully at Kings County Hospital that night.</p>
        <p>The next morning, a child welfare caseworker called the hospital. ''They said they had possession of my kids,'' Ms. Nicholson recalled. ''I was devastated. I've always heard the worst when they get involved.''</p>
        <p>The city charged her and Mr. Barnett with child neglect. Mr. Barnett, the court papers added, had hit the little boy in the mouth once before. Officials at the city child welfare agency also said Ms. Nicholson had not showed up in court and had refused to move to a new apartment.</p>
        <p>For her part, Ms. Nicholson denies that Mr. Barnett had hit Kendell. She acknowledges she missed one court appointment, citing a severe snowstorm. And she calls the child neglect charges ''ludicrous.''</p>
        <p>''When I called 911 I was bleeding so badly I knew I needed medical attention,'' Ms. Nicholson, 31, a store cashier and part-time college student, said the other day. ''I didn't know I'd end up down that road, that calling for help would escalate and I'd end up losing my kids.''</p>
        <p>A Family Court judge in Brooklyn returned her children in a week, while the child welfare agency continued to monitor her family. Her case has since been closed, but Ms. Nicholson's outrage at the child welfare agency remains.</p>
        <p>She is the lead plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit filed in April against the agency, claiming that her due process rights were violated. Carolyn A. Kubitschek, the lawyer who filed the suit, said she did so to compel the city to better train its caseworkers, so that children would not be removed just because a parent had been abused.</p>
        <p>By everyone's admission, deciding when a child is safe with a parent can be a nuanced, difficult question. The circumstances of each family are different, as are the highly subjective approaches of judges.</p>
        <p>In the Bronx, the pilot project placing all such cases under one judge was driven by the theory that doing so would bring a greater uniformity to how those decisions are made.</p>
        <p>In the vast majority of the 35 to 40 cases that Judge Richardson has handled in the last six months, the city had removed the children. And, in the vast majority of cases, he reversed the city's decision and sent the children back home: when a parent has agreed to take all the prescribed precautions, he said, it is unnecessarily harsh to keep their children in foster care.</p>
        <p>''I think the worst thing to do at that point is to remove their children,'' he said. ''Then that person has absolutely nothing, nothing to hope for.''</p>
