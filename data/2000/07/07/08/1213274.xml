        <p>A United Nations-sponsored study of AIDS infection among infants has dashed the hopes of scientists who thought they had found a simple way to prevent mothers from giving their infants the AIDS virus during breast-feeding.</p>
        <p>The results of the study, discussed during interviews here ahead of an international AIDS conference, confirmed earlier reports that a relatively simple drug regimen can stop many infected mothers from infecting their children during pregnancy and childbirth. But it also found that the protection does not last for as long as experts had hoped, and the therapy appears to leave children vulnerable to infection from breast milk.</p>
        <p>Scientists had hoped that the treatment would be a powerful weapon in their broad effort to shield very young children from the AIDS epidemic in Africa, without the need to tackle the difficult issue of breast-feeding, which is a medical risk but a cultural, religious or economic necessity for millions of African women.</p>
        <p>For about the last five years, doctors have been giving women in the United States and elsewhere infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, one of two treatments during pregnancy to prevent the spread of the disease to their unborn children. The infants were treated in the first few days after birth, and an earlier study showed significant reductions in AIDS infections in the first six weeks of life. The success of that and similar studies had been hailed as one of the rare triumphs in the war against AIDS.</p>
        <p>The new study, which involved 1,797 people and was the largest ever performed on the transmission of AIDS from mothers to children, followed children who were born to these mothers and found that by 18 months the initial benefit was completely lost as the infants who had been spared infection at birth later became infected through breast-feeding.</p>
        <p>At week six in the study, 6.7 percent of the babies born to mothers who took the two-drug combination were infected or had died, compared with 16.4 percent in the group that received no drugs. But the infection and death rates after 18 months were 21.3 percent in the treatment group compared with 26.8 percent in the placebo group.</p>
        <p>The findings are to be reported at the 13th International Conference on AIDS, which begins on Sunday. But the study's leaders disclosed the findings in extensive interviews in advance of the meeting because of their public health importance.</p>
        <p>''It's bad news,'' said Dr. Joep M. A. Lange, of the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the study's principal investigator. The study was conducted in South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda by researchers from the three African countries and his Dutch team.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, said Prof. Hoosen M. Coovadia, the head of the department of pediatrics and child health at the University of Natal and the AIDS conference's chairman, who helped design the United Nations study, ''it was naive to believe that continued breast-feeding would not make an impact.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, said Dr. Glenda Gray, who heads the perinatal research unit at Baragwanath Hospital and the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, ''it's not all or nothing because we can still make a difference'' by trying other approaches.</p>
        <p>The new challenge for AIDS researchers and government officials is to preserve the benefit of drug therapy in pregnancy and find safe alternatives to breast-feeding. That is a formidable task in Africa where the overwhelming majority of women breast-feed their infants for long periods. Poverty limits the ability of women to buy formula and breast-milk substitutes. Widespread contamination of water supplies and poor sanitation make it dangerous to mix formula. Also, male domination leaves many women with little ability to choose an alternative to breast-feeding. And a woman who avoids breast-feeding her infant can be stigmatized as having AIDS.</p>
        <p>Further, the findings seem certain to renew the often bitter controversy over breast-feeding, which pits the new public health emergency of AIDS against a fundamental, even ideological, pediatric practice. Proponents say ''breast is best'' for infant nutrition and that the dangers of contaminated water make the use of formula too risky. But opponents contend that formula and other substitutes are needed in the face of a growing epidemic in which an estimated 570,000 children became H.I.V.-infected last year, mostly in Africa, where more than a third of pregnant women in some countries are infected.</p>
        <p>Unaids, a joint United Nations program, has issued recommendations intended to discourage H.I.V.-infected women from breast-feeding, but it said the decision should be left to each mother, in part because the controversy cuts across cultural and religious beliefs.</p>
        <p>The new findings could also have political ramifications.</p>
        <p>The South African president, Thabo Mbeki, has caused an international furor in recent weeks over his questioning of the use of AZT in combating mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V.</p>
        <p>And the findings could bring added pressure on governments in third world countries for wider testing among pregnant women to identify those who can breast-feed safely and to identify and counsel mothers who are infected but whose infants are not.</p>
        <p>When the benefits of drug therapy during pregnancy were first reported, AIDS researchers were surprised that a relatively short course of drugs could have such an impact in preventing mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V. But there was no way to know in advance how long the benefit would last.</p>
        <p>In the regimen found most effective in that study, a woman takes AZT and another drug, 3TC (lamivudine), for four weeks before her expected delivery date and again during labor. Then both mother and infant take the two drugs for one week after delivery.</p>
        <p>The United Nations study was also pivotal in leading to apparent success with an even simpler, cheaper and seemingly more effective therapy -- a single pill of nevirapine given to a mother at the time of delivery and one dose in fluid form to the infant. That study was conducted in Uganda by Johns Hopkins University researchers with funding from the United States National Institutes of Health.</p>
        <p>However, Dr. Lange said that ''there is no reason to believe that this loss of effect is specific for'' the combination of AZT and 3TC.</p>
        <p>Indeed, a follow-up of the nevirapine study in Uganda shows the same negating effect in the breast-feeding period, said Francis Mmiro,  a professor of obstetrics at Makerere University in Kampala.</p>
        <p>In a separate development, Boehringer Ingelheim, which makes and sells nevirapine as Viramune, announced today that it would offer the drug at no charge for five years to prevent mother-to-child transmission in developing countries.</p>
        <p>The company said the action was part of its commitment to the collaborative effort of five companies, the United Nations, the World Bank and cooperating governments to explore practical collaborative efforts to make AIDS drugs more affordable and more widely available.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the United Nations study said they would have to go back to the drawing board to find new ways to block mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V.</p>
        <p>''No single intervention will control pediatric AIDS,'' said Dr. Coovadia. The challenge now is ''to make breast-feeding safer just as we have made sex safer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Coovadia and Professor Mmiro of Uganda were among those who said they were concerned that government leaders might stop paying for public programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission on the grounds that breast-feeding reversed many of the early gains.</p>
        <p>Geert Haverkamp, who coordinated the United Nations, said his Dutch team from the Academic Medical Center now plans to conduct at least one follow-up study to help identify new ways to prevent infection of newborns.</p>
        <p>In the planned study involving 500 children, they will receive either nevirapine or 3TC during the entire period their mother breast-feeds.</p>
        <p>In a possible second study, about 500 mothers will receive three anti-H.I.V. drugs (AZT, 3TC and a third to be chosen) for the entire period she breast-feeds.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on the new findings, Mr. Haverkamp, a sociologist, said that ''we know there are certain limitations to short-term therapy during pregnancy, but we have to fight for what we won.''</p>
