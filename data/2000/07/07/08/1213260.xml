        <p>VLADIMIR VOLTCHKOV was hanging in early against Pete Sampras yesterday.</p>
        <p>This was a semifinal matchup and the underdog from Brooklyn by way of Minsk, Belarus, was one of the tournament's most compelling stories: no endorsements, and forced to borrow shorts and shoes for his extended stay at Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>On a gray day, a hopeful Wimbledon crowd pulled for a mammoth upset by Voltchkov. He gave them hope by narrowly losing the first set in a tie breaker.</p>
        <p>But around the third game of the second set, Voltchkov realized that Sampras, even with a left ankle injury, had become a freight train and that he, Vladimir, was standing in its way. The defending Wimbledon champion prevailed,  7-6 (4), 6-2, 6-4.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure he'll grow from this experience,'' Sampras said. ''His ranking will go up. He can probably get a contract now for some clothes.''</p>
        <p>A day earlier, John McEnroe spoke about how unlikely it was that Sampras would play for the United States Davis Cup team against Spain in a few weeks.</p>
        <p>Since being named Davis Cup captain last year, McEnroe has pressed Sampras to play in the century-old team competition. Sampras skipped the first round because of a different injury but did help the Americans beat the Czechs in April.</p>
        <p>McEnroe, who has become increasingly public in his efforts to get Sampras on his team, thinks the Californian will use his injury as an excuse to skip the latest round.</p>
        <p>''When players go out there and see Pete Sampras totally dominate, it's aggravating to have him say he's not feeling right, McEnroe said Thursday. ''Pete talks about it, and it's like he's saying: 'If I lose, it's because of the injury. And by the way, I'm about to be in the finals again.' ''</p>
        <p>McEnroe may not fully understand Sampras, a champion who, in many ways, is like Tiger Woods. The worlds they choose to live in may only be an inch wide but may run miles deep. Woods focuses only on golf and winning; all that matters to Sampras is tennis, winning titles and being No. 1.</p>
        <p>It's not even about posperity. Sampras will go for a record 13th men's Grand Slam singles title. He wants to win it here at Wimbledon; if not, then at the United States Open. If Davis Cup becomes an obstacle, he will remove it.</p>
        <p>Yet, for Sampras, the individual parts -- winning here tomorrow or at Flushing Meadows in September -- are more important than his body of work.</p>
        <p>''You know, when you're going through the battle, you can't think of your place in history or your legacy,'' Sampras said yesterday. ''It is the match at hand. That's the attitude you have to have. You can't put that much pressure on yourself, looking at breaking records.''</p>
        <p>Later in the day, McEnroe explained why he was so passionate about Davis Cup; how from the time he was a kid growing up in Queens, Davis Cup tennis symbolized a love of game and country. How can anyone not be serious about Davis Cup?</p>
        <p>McEnroe, who last won Wimbledon in 1984, is 41; Sampras will turn 29 in August. They are champions of different generations. What they have in common is tennis -- and an exceptionally good life gained through tennis. Presumably, each wants to give back to the game.</p>
        <p>Is playing Davis Cup somehow tied into giving back to the game? ''I don't know,'' McEnroe answered. ''That's a good question: I don't know.''</p>
        <p>Until he comes up with an answer, Davis Cup will remain for most Americans little more than a curious artifact in search of a rhyme or reason. Sampras has been in Davis Cup before -- giving his all, playing hurt, winning the trophy -- only to feel like the soldier who comes home from war and nobody cares.</p>
        <p>McEnroe's challenge is to convert the passion and fire he has for the event into a broader vision that accommodates interests -- as diverse as the game of tennis is rapidly becoming. Diverse as 28-year-old Pete Sampras to 20-year-old Venus Williams to 22-year-old Vladimir Voltchkov.</p>
        <p>He'll have to talk with young players the way Arthur Ashe, as Davis Cup captain, talked to a young McEnroe -- about conduct and civility.</p>
        <p>McEnroe can't understand how players don't feel passionate about Davis Cup; Arthur, refined and dignified, couldn't understand why McEnroe behaved as he did.</p>
        <p>Right now Sampras doesn't get the Davis Cup. He gets Wimbledon. He gets the United States Open.</p>
