      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The United States government cannot by any measure of fairness carry out executions when there is powerful evidence of racial discrimination and geographic disparities in the imposition of federal death sentences. The Clinton administration, which has been unflinching in its support for capital punishment, is planning to take a small step in the direction of justice by postponing the execution of Juan Raul Garza.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garza, a migrant worker, was sentenced to death in 1993 under federal law for three drug-related murders in Texas. He is scheduled to die on Aug. 5, making him the first inmate to face execution by the federal government in nearly 40 years. The White House says it will postpone the execution to allow Mr. Garza to apply for clemency from the president under new rules that the Justice Department will issue soon.</p>

        <p>The United States government cannot by any measure of fairness carry out executions when there is powerful evidence of racial discrimination and geographic disparities in the imposition of federal death sentences. The Clinton administration, which has been unflinching in its support for capital punishment, is planning to take a small step in the direction of justice by postponing the execution of Juan Raul Garza.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garza, a migrant worker, was sentenced to death in 1993 under federal law for three drug-related murders in Texas. He is scheduled to die on Aug. 5, making him the first inmate to face execution by the federal government in nearly 40 years. The White House says it will postpone the execution to allow Mr. Garza to apply for clemency from the president under new rules that the Justice Department will issue soon.</p>
        <p>The temporary stay, though welcome, does not address the flaws in the system that has condemned Mr. Garza. This page has long opposed capital punishment on constitutional and moral grounds. At the very least President Clinton needs to order a moratorium on all federal executions until glaring inequities of race and geography can be eliminated.</p>
        <p>The Garza case engages both issues. The government has long had the duty of protecting racial minorities from discrimination. Yet racial bias in the federal system is worse than it is in most states. Of the 21 inmates facing federal death sentences, 17 are members of racial minorities, and 13 of those are African-Americans. These are overwhelmingly disproportionate numbers. Indeed, there is a higher percentage of blacks on federal death row than in the vast majority of death-penalty states, including Texas and Alabama. Of the 199 cases in which the Justice Department authorized the federal death penalty since 1988, 76 percent involved minority defendants, 52 percent of them African-Americans.</p>
        <p>The geographic disparities are also startling. Fourteen of 21 death row inmates are from three states -- Texas, Virginia and Missouri. Nearly half of the death-penalty requests sent by federal prosecutors to the Justice Department for review in recent years came from a handful of federal districts. Yet there are many federal prosecutors who have not filed any death-penalty requests, even though there is no reason to believe that the nature of crimes varies so greatly from city to city. But because prosecutors have discretion in deciding what crime to charge and whether to offer a plea bargain, the same crime may lead to death in one jurisdiction but not in another.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department is completing a report on these disparities. Even Mr. Clinton last week acknowledged that he was disturbed by the racial composition of the death row population and the fact that ''what your prosecution is may turn solely on where you committed the crime.'' He needs to act on his observations and re-examine this grossly  unjust system. He cannot allow the Justice Department, which routinely investigates bias by state and local governments, to operate a system that disproportionately condemns minority members to death.</p>
