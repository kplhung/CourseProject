        <p>In a noisy, divisive battle, several leaders of District Council 37, New York City's giant union of municipal workers, are pressing the council to pick its executive director through direct elections as a way to reduce corruption and win better contracts.</p>
        <p>After a scandal involving embezzlement and vote fraud rocked the council, these union leaders put much of the blame on the process of having delegates elect the director, saying it allowed corruption to flourish. For now, the union is in trusteeship, with no firm date set for selecting a new executive director.</p>
        <p>''There should be direct elections because the union belongs to its members,'' said Mark Rosenthal, president of a union local representing 3,500 city drivers and park workers. ''It's a slap in the face not to let rank-and-file voices be heard.''</p>
        <p>But the push for one-member, one-vote elections has met stiff resistance within the 125,000-member council. Many opponents of direct elections argue that it is wiser to have delegates elect the executive director because they are usually better informed than the rank and file and are more likely to be familiar with the candidates.</p>
        <p>Magda DeJesus, president of a local representing 270 city real estate employees, said: ''Unfortunately a lot of the rank and file are just there paying their dues, and as long as they get certain things and certain raises, they're just happy and they couldn't care less who their leaders are. But if you're a delegate, you're an activist, you're there day in and day out, and you know what's going on.''</p>
        <p>To put pressure on the council, Mr. Rosenthal and the presidents of several other union locals are planning a petition drive that would ask the council's executive board to hold a nonbinding referendum in which members would vote on whether they want direct elections. The council has 56 member locals and is part of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.</p>
        <p>The council's rules committee voted 6 to 2 last month against recommending that the executive board and the delegates' committee embrace direct elections for executive director. But Mr. Rosenthal and his allies say they hope to persuade the executive board and the delegates' committee to overrule the rules committee.</p>
        <p>Supporters of direct elections said such a system would increase pressure on the executive director to win large raises from the city, because the directors would know they would face the members' wrath if they negotiated poor contracts.</p>
        <p>Labor unions have long been split on one-member, one-vote elections. The United Automobile Workers, for example, relies on delegates to elect its president, while the Teamsters union uses direct elections. In New York, the United Federation of Teachers, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and 1199/SEIU, which represents hospital workers, use direct elections. So does the Civil Service Employees Association, a 77,000-member union representing New York State employees that is also a part of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.</p>
        <p>''People give two arguments against direct elections,'' said Charles Ensley, president of the council local representing 15,000 social workers, who has voiced interest in being executive director. ''One is it costs so much money, but any union that can't afford democracy should go out of business. The other argument is the activists, the delegates, are better informed and equipped to elect a leader. That argument says the people are too stupid to elect a leader.''</p>
        <p>Several opponents of direct elections said candidates might abuse the system by asking companies that provide services to the union, like printing firms, to make large campaign contributions and thus improperly influence the election.</p>
        <p>James Tucciarelli, president of a local representing 950 sewage treatment workers, said direct elections were no panacea. ''One person, one vote gave us Charlie Hughes and Al Diop, and gave them to us for a long time,'' he said. ''That's not the answer.''</p>
        <p>Charles Hughes, former president of a local representing 25,000 crossing guards and school cafeteria workers, pleaded guilty in April to embezzling more than $2 million. Albert A. Diop, who headed a local representing 24,000 administrative assistants, went on trial this week along with Martin Lubin, the council's former associate director, on charges of rigging the vote on the union's 1995 contract. Mr. Diop will face a separate trial on charges of stealing more than $1 million. He and Mr. Lubin have repeatedly proclaimed their innocence.</p>
        <p>One objection to election by delegates was that Mr. Diop and Mr. Hughes, as heads of the two largest locals, could virtually dictate who was executive director. Their hand was strengthened by a system of bloc voting, allowing them to cast the votes of all the delegates from their locals. To prevent the presidents of two or three locals from serving as kingmakers, the council is considering proposals to end such bloc voting.</p>
        <p>Lee Saunders, an assistant to the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, was named trustee of District Council 37 in November 1998 to clean up the union. Saying he wants to carry out many more changes, Mr. Saunders has given no indication when he would step aside and call for elections for executive director.</p>
        <p>''It is premature to talk about elections, because there is still a lot of work to be done at D.C. 37,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Several council officials said Mr. Ensley, the president of the social workers union, might have a fair chance of being elected in a direct election but would have far less of a chance in a delegates' vote because he has antagonized many council leaders.</p>
        <p>Several union leaders predicted that one or two of Mr. Saunders's three deputy trustees -- Zachary Ramsey, Eliot Seide and Dennis Sullivan -- might run for the executive director's position. Several officials left open the possibility that Mr. Saunders himself would run.</p>
