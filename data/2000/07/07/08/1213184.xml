        <p>Confounding Broadway's expectations, the British producer Cameron Mackintosh said yesterday that the highly acclaimed Royal National Theater production of ''Oklahoma!'' would not move to New York this season.</p>
        <p>The announcement, made in a two-paragraph statement, came after several months of behind-the-scenes preparations for the move, including casting calls, theater inquiries and the designation of opening night.</p>
        <p>''We have decided that due to the prior commitments of many of the production team, as well as the extremely short lead time for a December opening,'' Mr. Mackintosh said, ''the production would be better served by postponing to a later date.''</p>
        <p>That team includes the production's director, Trevor Nunn, who is also the artistic director of the Royal National Theater, and Susan Stroman, the show's Tony-winning choreographer (''Contact'') and one of the most sought-after talents on Broadway. And Mr. Mackintosh's new musical, ''The Witches of Eastwick,'' opens in London on July 18.</p>
        <p>Staged to nearly unanimous raves at the National in July 1998, the production was originally scheduled to come to New York last season. That transfer was delayed after the actors' union, Actors' Equity insisted that the British cast be replaced by American actors.</p>
