        <p>Two people -- including a tourist from Israel -- were robbed in daylight in well-trafficked areas of Central Park yesterday in incidents that did not appear to be related, the police said.</p>
        <p>The robberies followed weeks of scrutiny of safety and policing in Central Park, the crown jewel of New York City's parks, after the highly publicized sexual attacks against women in the park by groups of men after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on June 11.</p>
        <p>Overall crime in the Central Park precinct is up 9 percent through July 2 this year, compared with the same period last year, police statistics show. And robberies have increased 32 percent since 1999, with 33 during that period this year, compared with 24 last year.</p>
        <p>Some of the recent robberies have been particularly brazen. On Sunday, for example, three men were robbed of $100 at 1:20 p.m. at gunpoint in the Conservatory Garden. On June 30, a picnicking couple were robbed at gunpoint near Wollman Rink.</p>
        <p>The first of the robberies yesterday occurred near the Central Park Zoo at 62nd Street and East Drive at 6:40 a.m. Two men approached James Jonest, 43, of Manhattan and punched him in the face and stomach, the police said.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Jonest lay on the ground, the men stole $253 and his black jacket, which said ''Rockefeller Center'' on it. Mr. Jonest was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was treated and released.</p>
        <p>The robbers were about 18 years old, according to police. Mr. Jonest told the police one wore a black jogging suit and the other wore a dark shirt and blue pants.</p>
        <p>In the second robbery, a tourist from Israel was walking near the Central Park Boathouse at 74th Street and East Drive around 11:05 a.m. when she was approached by a man who demanded money.</p>
        <p>The tourist, Mae Benhur, 23, told the police that the man said he had a gun, but he did not show one. The man stole Ms. Benhur's CD player, $20 and a $100 American Express traveler's check.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 10, 2000, Monday  An article on Saturday about two robberies in Central Park referred incompletely to the crime rate there. While serious crimes over all are indeed up 9 percent through July 2 in the Central Park precinct, the numerical increase is five cases -- to 59 this year from 54 a year ago.</p>
