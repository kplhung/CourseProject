        <p>Erik Zabel knew what he wanted for his 30th birthday today: not another necktie or a good book, but exactly what he received for his 25th birthday. A victory in the Tour de France.</p>
        <p>On paper, the stage into Limoges looked promising for Zabel, the star German sprinter for the Telekom team. But he wanted the same present last year, and the year before, too, and came away disappointed. Although his wife and son may have given him the power drill of his dreams, nothing lights up a birthday party the way winning a Tour stage does.</p>
        <p>Wait till next year. Zabel never had a chance for victory today because Christophe Agnolutto, a Frenchman with the AG2R team, went on a 128-kilometer (80-mile) solo breakaway during this seventh of 21 daily stages, built a lead that neared eight minutes and held on to win by 1 minute 11 seconds. The triumph was the first for a Frenchman in the Tour in two years.</p>
        <p>Agnolutto, a winner of the Tour of Switzerland in 1997, has done nothing particularly successful since and ranked 82nd, more than 11 minutes behind the leader, when the 205.5-kilometer (128 miles) rolling ride began this morning in Tours. He won on a nasty day -- sun, rain, rain, sun, cool breezes throughout -- in a time of 5 hours 11 minutes 41 seconds, a speed of 39 kilometers an hour (24 m.p.h.).</p>
        <p>Because the victor was so submerged in the overall standings, there was no change at the top. Alberto Elli, an Italian with Telekom, continued at age 36 to be one of the oldest men ever to wear the leader's yellow jersey of the Tour, which began in 1903 and has been interrupted only by both world wars.</p>
        <p>Second in the standing is Fabrice Gougot, a Frenchman with Credit Agricole, who bolted away from the 172-man trailing pack in the final kilometer in a failed attempt to reduce his 12-second deficit.</p>
        <p>Marcel Wust, a German with Festina, was second across the line today behind Agnolutto, with Zabel third.</p>
        <p>In the first seven days of this 87th Tour, Zabel has come so close to ridding himself of what has nearly become an obsession for victory. On Sunday he was ideally placed in the last 100 meters leading into Loudun: at the front of a mass charge to the line. The same was true on Monday, into Nantes. The same Wednesday, into Vitre.</p>
        <p>With age, though, his hallmark is endurance, not the sudden acceleration that often decides a tight sprint. He finished third, third and second in those previous sprints -- close but, as he says, close isn't enough. What he wants is for everybody else to be close to victory, his victory.</p>
        <p>It has been three Tours de France since Zabel crossed a finish line first. From 1995, when he made his debut in the race, through 1997, he won seven stages. Since then there have been many second-place finishes, the worst place of all for most racers.</p>
        <p>''I'm confident, I feel good,'' Zabel said before the start of this Tour. ''Yes,'' he agreed, ''I've won a lot of races this year.'' Including the esteemed Milan-San Remo classic in March, he has 15 victories already, five more than he had in all of 1999.</p>
        <p>With the triumph in Italy, his third in that race, and a fourth place in the Tour of Flanders, followed by a third place in Paris-Roubaix and a victory in the Amstel Gold Race, Zabel leads the standing in the World Cup of one-day classics. He ranks second among the world's 800 professional riders.</p>
        <p>''Don't write Zabel off,'' another fine sprinter, Tom Steels, told the Belgian press Thursday. ''He's not winning, but you notice that he's among the top finishers every day. One day it will happen.''</p>

        <p>Nothstein Named to U.S. Team  By The Associated Press</p>
        <p>The United States Olympic cycling team, which was announced yesterday, includes the world's top-ranked sprinter, Marty Nothstein, and a second-generation Olympian, Christian Vande Velde, the team pursuit racer. Chris Witty, a speedskater who won the silver medal at 1,000 meters and the bronze at 1,500 in the Nagano Games, headlines the three-member women's squad.</p>
        <p>For the past three months, American cycling officials have charted top American riders. Evaluations began in the Olympic trials in Frisco, Tex., and continued in World Cup events. Instead of awarding spots based on finishes in the April trials, team officials formulated a subjective selection process intended to assemble the most competitive Olympic team.</p>
        <p>Witty, 25, is trying to become the second American to win medals in the Summer and the Winter Olympics. She will race in the 500-meter time trial, where she placed fourth in the 1998 world championships.</p>
        <p>Vande Velde, 24, rode with the victorious United States Postal Service team in last year's Tour de France.</p>
