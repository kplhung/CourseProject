        <p>Correction of June 22 article about the historical and racial implications of a plan for a national park on Magnolia Plantation in Louisiana</p>
      </abstract>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on June 22 about the historical and racial implications of a plan for a national park on Magnolia Plantation in Louisiana misstated the educational record of Viola Cowles, the mother of the park's historical interpreter. Mrs. Cowles graduated from high school and took some college courses. The article also misspelled the names of the park's superintendent, Laura Soulliere, and a member of the plantation's founding family, Mary Catallo. It also misstated Ms. Catallo's occupation. She is an executive of an engineering firm.</p>
        <p>A front-page picture caption described one of the plantation's slave cabins incorrectly. It was not the boyhood home of Leslie Vercher, who is helping restore the cabins (though Mr. Vercher did live on the plantation as a child).</p>
