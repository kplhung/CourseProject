        <p>Plenty of people in this small but spirited upstate city thought they were long past being surprised by Mayor Edward A. Hanna.</p>
        <p>In his 30 years in and out of office, Mr. Hanna -- a blunt, and, some would say, bullying politician -- erected a carillon outside City Hall to chime ''My Way'' on the hour, and publicly declared his fair city ''a lousy place to live.'' He paid for frequent TV and radio broadcasts to denounce the local newspaper, and for much of this year he restricted news-media access to City Hall information so effectively that the paper stopped running its police blotter.</p>

        <p>Plenty of people in this small but spirited upstate city thought they were long past being surprised by Mayor Edward A. Hanna.</p>
        <p>In his 30 years in and out of office, Mr. Hanna -- a blunt, and, some would say, bullying politician -- erected a carillon outside City Hall to chime ''My Way'' on the hour, and publicly declared his fair city ''a lousy place to live.'' He paid for frequent TV and radio broadcasts to denounce the local newspaper, and for much of this year he restricted news-media access to City Hall information so effectively that the paper stopped running its police blotter.</p>
        <p>But even Uticans who thought they had heard it all where Ed Hanna is concerned were plenty shocked last month when two current and two former male employees filed a notice accusing the mayor of sexual harassment.</p>
        <p>And the crowning surprise came on Monday, when the mayor, 78, announced his resignation in a news release, citing a longstanding heart problem that he said had become worse.</p>
        <p>The announcement, Mr. Hanna's only public communication on the subject, made no mention of the sexual harassment allegations, which he had characterized in an earlier news release as ''a scam, loaded with outrageous lies.''</p>
        <p>Even close colleagues were blindsided by the resignation, assuming that the combative mayor would keep up the fight.</p>
        <p>''I was certainly surprised,'' said Timothy Julian, the Common Council president, who started his Monday adding aluminum siding to his house and ended it giving interviews as the city's new mayor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Julian, 35, a laundry owner and landlord who has held public office for just six months, said this week that as the Republican running mate of Mr. Hanna, he planned to continue his predecessor's popular policies in economic development, beautification and public safety.</p>
        <p>Describing himself, however, as ''more laid-back,'' Mr. Julian suggested that his administration would not offer the drama that Uticans have grown accustomed to during the Hanna years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanna plastered downtown with placards and parks bearing his name. His normal speaking tone would be considered yelling by most standards, and he sprinkled his public remarks with four-letter words.</p>
        <p>People in this city of 63,000 tend to loathe or adore him. He receives high marks for replacing blighted buildings with parks and concert spaces, bolstering neighborhood associations and reviving the sagging morale of business owners, while holding the line on taxes.</p>
        <p>''When he started running for office I wasn't too keen about him. He was a little bit too way out,'' said Barbara Byrne, 69, who heads her neighborhood block association.  ''Now I'm fully convinced he's the only kind of person who can change anything in Utica.''</p>
        <p>Some, however, think his take-no-prisoners approach carried a cost. In an editorial today, the city's daily newspaper, The Observer-Dispatch, tempered praise for the former mayor's achievements with harsh criticism of his style.</p>
        <p>''In the end, Ed Hanna probably would like to be perceived as a dedicated public servant who challenged Uticans to take pride and do better,'' the editorial said. ''But in fact, he was a demagogue and a bully who had to rely on an eight-year-old medical report in a weak effort to step down from a public office he no longer deserved.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanna, a millionaire who perfected the technique used in coin-operated photo booths, always declared himself a businessman and not a politician. A Democrat-turned-Republican, he was mayor from 1972 to 1975 and returned in 1996. After winning re-election last November with a record-setting 75 percent of the vote, he immediately engaged in creating his trademark turmoil.</p>
        <p>From December until May he  forced The Observer-Dispatch and other news organizations to submit questions to city officials in writing and await written responses, which often arrived days later, if at all. Mr. Hanna said he was merely combating slanted and error-filled reporting, but many First Amendment watchdogs said the restrictions were among the most severe news blackouts they had heard of.</p>
        <p>Newspaper articles involving aspects of city government -- even  police and fire reports -- were often laughably incomplete, and some residents complained that they could not keep up with the crime in their neighborhoods. Typical of the hobbled reporting was the caption beneath a photo of a shooting victim in a stretcher that read simply: ''The victim is wheeled to an ambulance.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Hanna literally broadcast his feud with the media, he all but disappeared after the four current and former employees announced that they intended to file a suit charging a pattern of sexual harassment. The lawyer representing them, Frank Policelli, said he intended to file suit July 14, alleging that the mayor deliberately hired blond-haired, blue-eyed men in their 20's and 30's for City Hall jobs they were not necessarily qualified for, only to pressure them sexually. In some cases, Mr. Policelli said, they were fired for rebuking the mayor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanna did not return calls seeking comment and it is unclear whether he has chosen a lawyer to defend him. The corporation counsel,  John Dillon, said the city would not represent Mr. Hanna in the lawsuit.  By Wednesday, the new mayor had already held two news conferences and allowed an Observer-Dispatch reporter to accompany him on a his rounds through the city. ''I plan to be more approachable,'' Mr. Julian said.</p>
        <p>Utica being Utica, political waters are already being stirred up. While Mr. Julian and his fellow Republicans contend that the law allows him to remain in office for the next three and a half years, some Democrats immediately grumbled that a special election was necessary in the fall.  Regardless, unless Mr. Hanna returns to politics, it is bound to be calmer here.</p>
        <p>''Virtually everyone knew Ed Hanna and he was on 78 r.p.m.'s when the rest of the city was at 33 1/3,'' said John Zogby, a political pollster and a Utica native. ''Hanna brought the city to where it needed to be, but he probably carried it as far as he could. Now's the time for a unifier, a caretaker.''</p>
