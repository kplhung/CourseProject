        <p>TEDDY ROOSEVELT was in Syracuse that Labor Day for the opening of the New York State Fair when a man was arrested there for allegedly threatening to shoot the president. Foreign diplomats were predicting that war in the Balkans was inevitable. And at a baseball game in Brooklyn between the Superbas, as the team that became the Dodgers was known then, and John McGraw's New York Giants, the multitudes were howling.</p>
        <p>''At one point,'' according to the next day's New York Times, ''a riot seemed imminent.''</p>
        <p>With the Superbas' Sammy Strang trying to steal second in the fifth inning, Jimmy Sheckard, who led the National League that year with 9 home runs and 67 stolen bases, suddenly raised his bat, apparently with mischief in mind.</p>
        <p>When catcher Frank Bowerman's throw glanced off the bat and rolled near first base, Strang kept running and scored as the Giants' infielders stood around, assuming that the only umpire would nullify the run.</p>
        <p>''Hurst, however, gave the tally to Brooklyn and disallowed the claim of interference,'' The Times reported, referring to the umpire. ''McGraw and Bowerman, with four or five more of the New York players, protested while the partisans in the stands kept up an ear-splitting noise, some applauding and others protesting the umpire's fiat. Bowerman was ejected.''</p>
        <p>This was the way it was nearly a century ago, on Sept. 7, 1903, in New York's primeval preview of today's Yankees-Mets doubleheader in Queens and the Bronx: the Giants' 6-4 triumph in the morning at Washington Park's wooden grandstand in Brooklyn, the Superbas' 3-0 victory that afternoon at the rickety Polo Grounds at Eighth Avenue and West 155th Street in Upper Manhattan under what is still known as Coogan's Bluff.</p>
        <p>Nobody called it a subway series; the city's subway wouldn't open until late the next year. But the city had elevated trains and trolleys. Maybe that's how the teams traveled from one ballpark to the other.</p>
        <p>The primary personalties in the interborough rivalry were McGraw, the Giants' pugnacious manager, and Charles Ebbets, the Superbas' owner remembered for proclaiming, ''Baseball is in its infancy.'' So was the feud that endured until the Dodgers and the Giants departed for Los Angeles and San Francisco after the 1957 season.</p>
        <p>In that 1903 season New York also had its first American League team, the Highlanders, the ancestors of the Yankees, who split a morning-afternoon Labor Day doubleheader with the Boston Pilgrims (now the Red Sox) at Hilltop Park in Washington Heights. In the afternoon game, the Highlanders defeated the great Cy Young, 5-0.</p>
        <p>But the lead sports headline the next day in The Times (which sold for 1 cent), The Herald and The Evening Post went to the winner of the Twin City Handicap at the Sheepshead Bay racetrack. McChesney, described as ''the great horse of the West,'' tied the track record for a mile and a quarter before 50,000.</p>
        <p>The reported total attendance for the four baseball games was 44,000, including 23,000 at the Polo Grounds, where Henry Schmidt, the Superbas' 30-year-old rookie right-hander, outdueled Joe (Iron Man) McGinnity, who that August justified his nickname by pitching (and winning) both games of three doubleheaders.</p>
        <p>McGinnity went on to a 31-20 record, pitching 434 innings with 44 complete games. His teammate Christy Mathewson was 30-13 with 267 strikeouts. Together, the future Hall of Famers appeared in 100 games. The Giants finished second, six and a half games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates, whose Honus Wagner batted .355.</p>
        <p>For the Superbas, who finished fifth, Schmidt had a 21-13 record in his only major league season. Early the next year he sent the club a telegram: ''I do not like living in the East and will not report.'' He didn't.</p>
        <p>Ebbets, who built the ballpark named for him that opened in 1913, had been a ticket seller, clerk and briefly the manager before he bought the Dodgers (Brooklynites were known as trolley dodgers) for $30,000 in 1898. He installed it in Washington Park on Third Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues, where a playground is now.</p>
        <p>When Ebbets hired Ned Hanlon as manager, the team was briefly called the Superbas, after a popular vaudeville act, Hanlon's Superbas.</p>
        <p>The Highlanders, who played at Broadway and West 165th Street, where New York Presbyterian Medical Center is now, finished fourth in 1903, but their crusty manager, Clark Griffith, later the longtime owner of the Washington Senators, challenged the Giants to a post-season city series. The established Giants ignored the suggestion.</p>
        <p>''It's a cheap advertising stunt,'' snapped John T. Brush, the Giants' haughty owner. ''Who is Griffith? I never heard of him. There is only one club in New York and that is the Giants.''</p>
        <p>Nobody on the Yankees, not even George Steinbrenner, would dare say that there is only one club in New York now. And nobody on the Mets would dare say it. But they all would love to.</p>
