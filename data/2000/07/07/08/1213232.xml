        <p>It was just past midnight when the phone jangled in the home of Malegapuru Makgoba, one of South Africa's most influential scientists. To his astonishment, he heard the voice of President Thabo Mbeki rumbling across the line.</p>
        <p>The president was thumbing through scientific journals, surfing the Net and pondering the AIDS epidemic that is ravaging this country. He was calling for advice late that January night, but he ultimately disregarded Mr. Makgoba's counsel and began exploring the work of two Americans who argue that H.I.V. does not cause AIDS.</p>
        <p>The news of Mr. Mbeki's interest in such a theory -- though he has never explicitly adopted it -- exploded in the news media.</p>
        <p>Prominent doctors accused Mr. Mbeki of dabbling in pseudoscience while people were dying. Even government officials wondered why the president had unleashed such a furor. ''Why not just keep quiet?'' asked Joel Netshitenzhe, the chief of government communications, summing up the comments of some anxious officials.</p>
        <p>On Sunday Mr. Mbeki will confront many critics, including Mr. Makgoba, when he addresses thousands of researchers here on the opening day of the 13th International Conference on AIDS. He will stand before them, the leader of a country swept up in the plague, with his reputation bruised and his credibility questioned.</p>
        <p>But if he has stumbled in his handling of the crisis, his struggle also offers rare insight into the thinking of an intensely private leader in his first year in office.</p>
        <p>Over the past two months, as he has tried to clarify his stance, Mr. Mbeki has painted a self-portrait of a restless intellectual, a meticulous hands-on manager who rarely delegates decisions, a chief executive who challenges convention, even when advisers suggest otherwise.</p>
        <p>''I didn't go into this work, into this office, in search of popularity,'' Mr. Mbeki said, according to Mr. Netshitenzhe, when some officials suggested that the president should have shied away from the fray. ''If there are issues to be dealt with, they need to be pursued.''</p>
        <p>For South Africa, it is a striking shift in substance and style. Nelson Mandela, the country's first democratically elected leader, delegated many responsibilities, serving as a charismatic caretaker president. Mr. Mbeki thrives on details, closely manages his cabinet and often analyzes important matters way into the night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mbeki's critics say this means that the president sidelines his own ministers and experts. His supporters say this means his ministers must be prepared to study the issues as carefully as the president does. In practice it means that all but his most capable ministers sometimes fade from view.</p>
        <p>For instance it was clearly Mr. Mbeki, not the health minister, who drove the government's inquiry into the causes and treatment of AIDS.</p>
        <p>He was the one who came across the research by two American biochemists, Peter Duesberg and David Rasnick, who argue that poverty and malnutrition -- not the human immunodeficiency virus -- cause AIDS. He was the one who began questioning the safety of the commonly prescribed drug AZT after reading criticism of the drug on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mbeki contacted local and foreign researchers, surrounded himself with books and journals and consulted with the minister of health when he came across medical terms he did not understand. And when he noticed opinions that challenged established views, he did not hesitate to pursue them.</p>
        <p>He is, after all, no stranger to challenging the establishment. During the apartheid years, he was among the first members of the African National Congress to argue that negotiation with whites -- not armed revolution -- would lead to the demise of apartheid.</p>
        <p>As president, he has been willing to challenge his allies, the labor unions, by taking a tough stance on labor talks and vowing to speed privatization and to relax some protections for workers, a position that has helped strengthen investor confidence.</p>
        <p>And it was only natural, officials say, that Mr. Mbeki would turn his scrutiny to AIDS. According to the United Nations, South Africa has the largest number of people living with H.I.V., an estimated 4.2 million, or 20 percent, of its residents.</p>
        <p>''Fundamentally, he's raising these issues because in South Africa, in our region, we've got to find, we have to find the necessary solutions to enable us to deal with this pandemic,'' said Essop Pahad, the minister of the office of the presidency and one of Mr. Mbeki's close friends.</p>
        <p>''And if he wants to understand something, he will not rely only on other people's views,'' Mr. Pahad said in an interview. ''He wants to understand it for himself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mbeki is not scientifically trained, but was an outstanding student in South Africa and earned a scholarship to the University of Sussex in England, where he got a degree in economics.</p>
        <p>His critics say the controversy shows how Mr. Mbeki's singlemindedness and reluctance to defer to experts can be risky. Even some government officials worry that Mr. Mbeki's ruminations on AIDS (and the media's simplification of his views) may have undermined efforts to prevent the disease.</p>
        <p>The news of Mr. Mbeki's consultation with the two Americans was widely broadcast on television and radio here. And counselors say they are encountering people who assume they can engage in risky sexual behavior because the president has suggested that H.I.V. is not the real cause of AIDS. There is so much international consternation over Mr. Mbeki's suggestions and the impact they may have that 5,000 scientists from across the world signed a declaration affirming that H.I.V. causes AIDS. The statement was published this week in the magazine Nature.</p>
        <p>''People are outraged at what's happening,'' said Mary Caeser, the national coordinator of the AIDS Legal Network, a human rights and service organization. ''While the president has the prerogative to address any issue, people feel that the manner in which he is handling the issue is irresponsible. It's created confusion. We've lost ground in terms of the work we have done.''</p>
        <p>The government has already begun a quiet retreat. Mr. Mbeki, who angrily described the criticism as a ''campaign of intellectual intimidation and terrorism'' in a letter to President Clinton, began tempering his comments during a visit to the United States in May.</p>
        <p>This week the health minister, Dr. Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, admitted in Parliament that government officials, including Mr. Mbeki, were mistaken when they said AZT was too toxic to prescribe to pregnant mothers. She said research showed that the benefits of the drug clearly outweighed the risks, though she says it is still too expensive.</p>
        <p>And an international panel of scientists convened by President Mbeki disbanded this week without making any proclamations on the question of what causes AIDS.</p>
        <p>Mr. Netshitenzhe and Mr. Pahad emphasize that Mr. Mbeki did make important points that are rarely mentioned, including the inability of Western science so far to cope with the disease in Africa.</p>
        <p>The president highlighted the differences between the virus in Africa, typically transmitted heterosexually, and the strain in the West, which is most commonly transmitted through homosexual contact and intravenous drug use. And the officials praised him for being in the forefront of a push for a vaccine developed in Africa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Makgoba, who has become one of Mr. Mbeki's fiercest critics, nevertheless says the president should get credit for financing research into a vaccine and for being willing to evolve in his thinking.</p>
        <p>For months, Mr. Makgoba admits, he was angered by the president's public musings about AZT and by his decision to consult with the American researchers. But he describes that as ''water under the bridge.'' In hindsight, he says, the whole issue has helped him better understand the man who is leading the country.</p>
        <p>''He's a continuous learner,'' said Mr. Makgoba, who heads the Medical Research Council, the South African equivalent to the National Institutes of Health. ''He wants to understand things. He's basically a man who wants to exercise his power with knowledge derived from his own understanding of things. That sets him apart from presidents in the Western world, where most people rely on being fed information from advisers.''</p>
        <p>''It means he doesn't take accepted views easily,'' Mr. Makgoba said. ''Sometimes it's part of his strength. It can also be his weakness.''</p>
