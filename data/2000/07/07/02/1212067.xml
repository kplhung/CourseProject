        <p>Abyssinian Chronicles</p>
        <p>By Moses Isegawa.</p>
        <p>462 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $26.</p>
        <p>A grandfather, a father and his son are the three figures that form a tripod from which Moses Isegawa suspends his panoramic first novel about Uganda's stormy postcolonial history. Grandpa represents the traditional order, his son Serenity the chaos of transition, and Mugezi the despair of a younger generation over the dead end of transition and its own prospects.</p>
        <p>Rootless and bitter, Mugezi will flee finally to Europe from a country -- its traditions destroyed and its modernity a corrupt failure -- whose name he can no longer bear to use. He calls it Abyssinia instead. For centuries this was what outsiders, including Mussolini in his empire-dreaming vainglory, called another African country: Ethiopia.</p>
        <p>Isegawa's theme, periodically and sometimes haphazardly inserted, is that the implants of colonialism, proselytizing religions, party politics, capitalism, militarism and international financial aid have distorted Uganda's authenticity and rendered it a realm of baleful imagination. Isegawa's own imagination is suitably dark (like Mugezi, his narrator, he left Uganda as a very young man and is now a Dutch citizen). His book is also gaudy, sporadically brilliant, disjointed and often tongue-tied by writing that alternates between an absorbingly straightforward account of Uganda's recent history and a lumpy porridge of ornate venting. It sometimes resembles a car crash -- the hyperkinetic rush of transport along with the awful grind of smashed metal.</p>
        <p>But we should remember that had Dickens been a much worse writer and his the only epic account of society in mid-19th-century England, he would be precious for that reason alone. For all its defects as a novel, not to mention its genuine strengths, ''Abyssinian Chronicles'' pierces through the weave of our vague associations about Uganda: Idi Amin, expelled Indian shopkeepers, AIDS, coffee and the fate of Milton Obote -- what ever happened to him, anyway?</p>
        <p>If it were left to rare journalistic overflights, Uganda would occupy yet another swatch of the cloud cover between our own concerns and too much of the rest of the world. Isegawa makes his country a locus of life, tragedy and character that, however roughly scrawled, stays with us. His novel commands attention and occasionally deregulates the pulse.</p>
        <p>The book starts with a striking image, which ''flashed across Serenity's mind as he disappeared into the jaws of the colossal crocodile: a rotting buffalo with rivers of maggots and armies of flies emanating from its cavities.'' The crocodile to punish the Westernizing pretensions of this villager turned labor union leader; the buffalo for the pretensions of Padlock, Serenity's pietistic Roman Catholic wife (the beast fell over upon her, fatally, as she was out on a walk). In one paragraph Isegawa foreshadows both two individual ends and the universal war between the old spirit of the land and a jerry-built modernity.</p>
        <p>After this flash-forward, he introduces the extended Ugandan family whose fortunes -- misfortunes, mostly -- will constitute a chronicle stretching over 30 years. Grandpa, the patriarch, is a rural eminence, administrator of his clan's profitable coffee lands and holder of a political post as county subchief. He is the book's most suggestively imagined character: a figure of dignity and courage, a traditional nationalist whose anti-British sentiments led him to sympathize with the Germans during World War II and eventually to lose his official post. His is a mighty fall. A whole court of hangers-on melts away; but the old man retains his pride and sense of himself. Throughout the convulsions that attend Idi Amin's seizure of power and eventual overthrow, he remains a clear voice until he falls victim to a civil-war shooting. Mugezi identifies his body by the patched brogues that protrude from under a pile of rubble.</p>
        <p>The narrator introduces Grandpa's relatives with the note of self-conscious comic oddity endemic to a whole genre of exotic family chronicles (one goes back well before Thurber's ''My Life and Hard Times,'' set in darkest Columbus, Ohio). There is Grandpa's finicky daughter Tiida, who takes four daily baths and marries a medical practitioner who converts to Islam to advance his career. An infected circumcision disables him for months, while a jealous neighbor bombards their house with rotting dog entrails.</p>
        <p>There is Kawayida, Serenity's half brother, a poultry farmer who sleeps with his wife's two sisters and whose blithe tales of city life in Kampala fascinate little Mugezi. Years later, dying of Slim -- the Ugandan name for the new AIDS epidemic -- Kawayida shares his philosophy: ''Son, do whatever you want in life but know when it is over.''</p>
        <p>Serenity, unquiet, rejects Grandpa's offer of an arranged marriage and marries the turbulent Nakkazi, nicknamed Padlock, instead. She is a former nun expelled from her order for beating her pupils too hard. To establish her power among her in-laws, she gives birth in quick succession to seven children and bullies Serenity into moving to Kampala. There, after some struggle, he enjoys a modestly corrupt prosperity as a leader in the postal workers' union.</p>
        <p>A puritanical fanatic -- her religious transports evoke some of the author's most garish prose -- Padlock conceives an aversion, reciprocally shared, toward Mugezi, her firstborn. Frequently beaten, he is given the worst household jobs, notably cleaning up after his younger siblings' bowel movements. The warfare between Mugezi and his mother takes up an obsessive near quarter of the book, far more than any interest it can sustain.</p>
        <p>''Abyssinian Chronicles'' suffers from a disabling split. It is best as a chronicle of Ugandan history and of the struggles of different generations of a family to cope with it. It is weakest as a third world bildungsroman: we get Mugezi and his mother, Mugezi's guerrilla warfare at the seminary he briefly attends, a stint teaching at a terrible school and moonlighting as manager of a relative's brewery and a lame last section set in Amsterdam. There, he works as a grave-digger, makes joyless love to two women and, in a doubtfully Joycean non serviam, declares himself free of his past.</p>
        <p>Some of the book's weakest writing comes in these sections. In her vindictivess and religious mania, Padlock is a portrait overexposed. Her husband, at least until the crocodile gets him, is underexposed: an uncertain presence at home and seen only patchily in his life outside. Even while treating Serenity lightly, though, the narrative tends to contort. For instance, when he overcomes his scruples to become the lover of Padlock's aunt, ''the mushroom of his pent-up desire had found a weak spot in the layers of hypocritical decency and had pushed into the turbulent air of truth, risk, personal satisfaction, revenge.''</p>
        <p>Mugezi's narrative overstrains its imagery as it tries to link the turbulence of his country with its natural phenomena or his own personal sufferings. Rain comes ''sweeping in with the fury of impotent judicial courts and raking the land with the crushing power of mighty army officers.'' A despot -- here Padlock metamorphoses into Idi Amin -- did what he did because the time was right, and because he had allowed himself to be goaded into the hard corner of slowly simmering rage.'' Mugezi does better, in fact, as witness of others' stories than as protagonist and narrator of his own. Perhaps the virtues of ''Abyssinian Chronicles'' would have shown more clearly if it had been told in a more distanced and less burdened third person.</p>
        <p>What Mugezi sees, in any case, is more compelling than what he feels. There is much that compels. Aside from Grandpa, the book's best-rendered character is a sister of Padlock's who gives Mugezi occasional quiet refuge even while taking a leading role in the underground. She and her comrades support Obote's forces against Amin. Later, after Obote's return to power degenerates into oppression, they go underground once more and overthrow him. Coloring the political chronicle is the movingly reticent portrait of a strong but by no means assured woman.</p>
        <p>Where the narrative fireworks best fit their subject is in scenes of the recurring civil war: the violent eruption into the villages of Amin's retreating forces, the initial celebrations in Kampala when Obote's troops move in. Without losing its glare, Isegawa's prose tightens into understated horror in a scene of black-lighted theater in which a sweet-talking soldier lures one of Mugezi's relatives into a building and, with four comrades, rapes her repeatedly. The writing is big, but here the story is bigger.</p>
