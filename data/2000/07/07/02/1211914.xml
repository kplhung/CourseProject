        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for your article on our struggle with the 7-Eleven Corporation (''Taking on 7-Eleven in Holmdel,'' June 18). As the father of a child in the New School and as co-director of New High School, I have found this battle to be of utmost importance to our school and the residential neighborhood around us.</p>
        <p>The New School and New High School differ from other schools because we devote much of our curriculum to the importance of building a cooperative community. We teach our students that the process of building a community requires understanding the needs of the people with whom they work.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for your article on our struggle with the 7-Eleven Corporation (''Taking on 7-Eleven in Holmdel,'' June 18). As the father of a child in the New School and as co-director of New High School, I have found this battle to be of utmost importance to our school and the residential neighborhood around us.</p>
        <p>The New School and New High School differ from other schools because we devote much of our curriculum to the importance of building a cooperative community. We teach our students that the process of building a community requires understanding the needs of the people with whom they work.</p>
        <p>Your article captured 7-Eleven's confusion about what our community needs. Statements by a Southland Corporation spokeswoman, Margaret Chabris, demonstrates this confusion. She states: ''We know what the concerns of the school and residents are, and we have been more than willing to address them.''</p>
        <p>Had Southland, owners of the 7-Eleven chain, done a little research, some of her confusion might have been alleviated. At an early meeting, 7-Eleven's representative was surprised to learn they were seeking use variances on a property adjacent to a school. Later they discovered they had to redo a traffic study because they could not figure out that the school had half days on Wednesdays.</p>
        <p>This is not the way to work with a community. Ms. Chabris recites platitudes about working with the school and residents while 7-Eleven and its lawyer alternately bully and bore the planning board of Holmdel. After a year of town meetings there has not been a single person who has come out in favor of building a 7-Eleven at Laurel Avenue and Middle Road, except for expert witnesses paid for by 7-Eleven.</p>
