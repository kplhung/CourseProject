        <p>FIVE years after Massachusetts voters  ended rent regulation  or, more precisely, ended it in Boston, Brookline and Cambridge, the three cities that still had some form of rent control -- rents have taken sizable jumps, the cities are spiffier and less pockmarked by deteriorating neighborhoods and many poorer people have been forced to move to communities farther from the urban core.</p>
        <p>While no overall study of the effects of the end of controls on rents has been made, a survey by a leading landlord in Cambridge found that rents for his company's formerly controlled apartments have doubled.</p>
        <p>With the economy of the Boston area booming, landlord and tenant advocates, politicians and academics who study housing all agree that the degree to which rent deregulation itself produced those effects is impossible to determine. Yet, for good or ill, they all see deregulation as a factor in the changing faces of the three cities.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, we enjoy an especially strong rental market,'' said Edwin J. Shanahan, the executive director of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board. ''Demand continues to outpace supply.'' That is caused by several factors, Mr. Shanahan said, ''not the least of which was the 25 years when we had rent control.''</p>
        <p>''Over those decades nobody would come into Boston, Brookline or Cambridge to build rental housing,'' he said. ''So we essentially ended up with 25 years of no measurable increase in supply.''</p>
        <p>Since the end of rent regulation, Mr. Shanahan said, ''we've seen substantial rehabilitation of our housing stock in those three communities, and a tremendous increase in the number of developers looking to develop'' -- although so far there has been a lot more interest than actual development, he conceded.</p>
        <p>Peter Dreier, Boston's housing director from 1984 to 1992 and now a professor of public policy at Occidental College in Los Angeles, is not so sanguine. ''What Boston shows is that a rising tide does not lift all boats,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Poor and working-class families are squeezed,'' Dr. Dreier said. ''If you're a waiter, a chambermaid, even a schoolteacher or a nurse, you have to pay half your income or more to put a roof over your head. And if you're really poor, you're going to be doubling and tripling up.''</p>
        <p>Or moving out of town.</p>
        <p>Dian Weaver, 31, a divorced mother of three, used to live in a six-unit building in a poorer section of Cambridge. She was paying $300 a month when rent control ended in 1995. By 1998, the rent was $600, and she had to move.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weaver, who refuses to go on welfare, kept her jobs at two restaurants in Cambridge, earning about $500 a week. She moved to Attleboro, Mass., and now commutes to work by train, an hour each way. The rent for her old apartment, ''last I heard,'' she said: ''$850.''</p>
        <p>IN a referendum on Nov. 8, 1994, residents of Massachusetts -- though lacking a majority in each of the three affected cities -- ended rent regulation by a vote of 1,034,594 to 980,723, or 51 to 49 percent. The referendum had been spurred, particularly, by a coalition of small-property owners in Cambridge, which had the most stringent form of rent control covering most of the apartments in a city comprised predominantly of renters. The impact of rent regulation in Boston and Brookline had been muted in recent years by vacancy decontrol. In all, about 100,000 units were decontrolled on Jan. 1, 1995.</p>
        <p>No comprehensive study of the effects of deregulation in the three cities has since been conducted. But in Boston, according to Elizabeth Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Mayor Thomas M. Menino, the average rent for two-bedroom apartments hit $1,550 in 1999, up 75.1 percent from $882 in 1995.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the best currently available barometer is a study by Alex Steinbergh, a principal of Resource Capital Group, a large landlord in Cambridge, which used as a sample the 242 deregulated units in the 15 buildings the company owns.</p>
        <p>''The sample showed that as of November 1999, the average rent for all of the previously rent-controlled units essentially doubled, from $510 to $1,016,'' Mr. Steinbergh said. The survey also showed that 89 of the 242 formerly rent-controlled units, or 37 percent, had the same tenant as in January 1995. ''Now the rents of those tenants, on average, went up from $577 to $967,'' Mr. Steinbergh said, a 68 percent increase. ''So those tenants' rents weren't going up as much as new tenants'.''</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Steinbergh's apartments were already on the open market at the time of deregulation, ''and the average increase on those market-rate units was 31 percent, from $1,025 to $1,343,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On a recent meandering drive through Cambridge, Mr. Steinbergh pointed out that, ''if you pick streets at random, you'll find rehab work on virtually every one.'' And, indeed, like rainbow sprinkles on a sundae, bright pastel shingles in an array of shades adorned the sides of grand old buildings -- many with turret-like bay windows and stately porticos -- on block after block.</p>
        <p>''The exteriors have been fixed up, and inside there are new heating systems, electrical, plumbing,'' Mr. Steinbergh said. ''We think about a third of the 15,000 formerly controlled units have done some rehab.''</p>
        <p>Similar patterns of housing rehabilitation were evident in Boston proper. And while Mayor Menino was proud of the facelifting and economic rejuvenation of many neighborhoods, he was unequivocal in his assessment of rent deregulation: ''A disaster.''</p>
        <p>In his State of the City Address on Jan. 11, the mayor declared affordable housing one of his highest priorities. ''We have an obligation to make sure that prosperity doesn't price people out,'' he said. ''A stable economy needs workers at every level. And a stable city needs a variety of housing for a variety of incomes.''</p>
        <p>IN an interview, Mayor Menino said: ''We're losing the middle class. I know a situation in South Boston where this young couple has gone up in the last year over $600 a month in rent. And there's no way to combat that; they are at the mercy of the landlord. The affluent are moving to our city in record numbers. But our homeless family numbers have gone up 10 percent over the last year.'' The city's vacancy rate is 1.6 percent.</p>
        <p>The problem, Mayor Menino said, ''is that there aren't any rental housing proposals out there.''</p>
        <p>''Rent control came off and the housing industry said they will help us build new housing,'' the mayor said. ''Well, it's five years later and I'm still waiting for the industry to come forward with new housing proposals; any kind, but affordable housing for the most part.''</p>
        <p>''Million-dollar luxury homes; there are some of those being built in our city,'' the mayor continued, ''obviously not for the working person.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shanahan of the real estate board said that the lack of development of affordable housing ''essentially has to do with the inordinate delays one encounters in trying to work through the maze of permits and approvals that are required in a city as old as Boston and with as much neighborhood activism as Boston enjoys.''</p>
        <p>''Quite frankly,'' he said, ''when you are looking at a two and a half year process to find out whether you are even going to be able to play, the game requires a significant amount of capital to be put at risk.''</p>
        <p>To which the mayor responded: ''I don't believe that. If you come up with a good proposal for rental housing in our city, we will expedite it.''</p>
