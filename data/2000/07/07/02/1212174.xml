        <p>IMAGINE that the year is 2010 and you see a book of interest in a friend's home library.</p>
        <p>Instead of writing down the author's name and the title, you pull out a hand-held computer and scan the bar code on the back. And instead of going to a bookstore to buy the book, dial into the Internet and feed in the bar code, which finds the book instantly on Amazon.com. One click, the purchase is made and the book is delivered the next day.</p>
        <p>That technique will be commonplace for everything from books to refrigerators in the world envisioned by Jerry Swartz, the founder and former chief executive of Symbol Technologies, a Holtsville-based company credited with helping to develop the first bar codes and hand-held scanners 25 years ago.</p>
        <p>First, a quick history of the bar code: it was designed in the early 1970's when I.B.M., supermarkets, printers, the electronics industry and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology came together looking for something that identified products quickly.</p>
        <p>''We needed something that was machine-readable and fast, and the bar code was something people had been talking about,'' said Mr. Swartz, who founded the company in 1975 after a teaching career at City College and Brooklyn Polytechnic University. ''What Symbol had to do was come up with something that would make sure the bar codes would be printed and read properly.''</p>
        <p>The answer: hand-held bar-code printers and hand-held scanners.</p>
        <p>By the early 1980's, scientists at Symbol had developed a printer-scanner that weighed about a pound.</p>
        <p>''It was one of the first mobile information appliances,'' Mr. Swartz said. ''It was not just fixed on a checkout counter or a manufacturing floor. It allowed a person walking around the supermarket or postal workers on the street to read volumes of information with our scanners.''</p>
        <p>By the early 1990's, Symbol was able to pare down the scanners to about an ounce and the laser diodes on the end that read codes to less than a cubic inch. Today's scanners are less than one-fifth a cubic inch, about the perfect size for the tip of a Palm Pilot computer.</p>
        <p>One of Symbol's largest long-term contracts is with the United States Postal Service, whose 300,000 carriers use hand-held scanners.</p>
        <p>''If you think about what Symbol does on the wireless end, the bar-code end and on our hand-held wireless tools, we are connecting physical space to the virtual world,'' Mr. Swartz said. ''We were doing e-commerce before it was called e-commerce, pre-Internet.''</p>
        <p>Decisions made more than 20 years ago have put Symbol at the forefront of what is referred to as the post-PC era, when information, the Internet and hand-held technology are expected to overtake the desktop personal computer, said Mr. Swartz, who holds 150 patents and whose company has an additional 350.</p>
        <p>On July 1 Mr. Swartz is resigning as chief executive to return to teaching, after having shaped Symbol into a $1.13 billion company that employs 2,175 workers on the Island. He will be replaced by the chief operating officer, Tomo Razmilovic, while retaining his position as chief scientist. The company has about 4,100 employees worldwide, with 3,100 in the United States.</p>
        <p>At a White House ceremony in March, President Clinton awarded Symbol the National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest honor for technology innovation. The president presented the award, the only one this year, to Symbol for ''creating the global market for laser bar-code scanning and for technology innovation and practical application of mobile computing and wireless local area network technologies.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Swartz traced the past and future of Symbol.</p>
        <p>The technology ''started with the question of how you could quickly move items at the checkout counter in the supermarket,'' and now has moved on to other things.</p>
        <p>''If you look at it in perspective,'' he said, ''bar-coding is so pervasive in food and packaging, but also transportation and logistics and hoteling and education. It is going everywhere because you need fast and accurate collection of information.''</p>
        <p>The company has also established partnerships -- outside bar-code technology -- with Intel, the International Olympic Committee and Qualcomm, the maker of the popular electronic mail program Eudora. For example, Intel has invested $100 million in Symbol, purchasing about 1.4 million shares, a 1.5 percent stake in the company, for a project to develop high-speed wireless networks.</p>
        <p>Several online grocers have endorsed hand-held Symbol scanners for consumer use. The company is also working on plans to develop the next generation of multimedia telephones.</p>
        <p>Mr. Swartz envisions a transition from e-commerce to m-commerce, or mobile commerce, for direct purchases by consumers. For example, for husbands who have trouble remembering the groceries their wives want them to pick up, the wives can scan the old boxes in the house and have a ready-made, detailed list, with bar codes, Mr. Swartz said.</p>
        <p>The technology is quite simple, he said. Many hand-held computers already have Internet access. He envisions a world when scanning a bar code included with a newspaper article would link the reader to documents or Web sites about the companies, products, people or events in the article. The Charleston, S.C., Post and Courier has already begun to experiment with such technology.</p>
        <p>But even in Mr. Swartz's upbeat world, it is no surprise that the technology has some downsides. Beware the colleague at work who tries to scan the tag on your briefcase, or the jealous new friend at the cocktail party who cannot resist the temptation to scan the tag on your clothes.</p>
