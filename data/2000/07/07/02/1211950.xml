        <p>Dominique first heard the strange word directly from her father four years ago, when she was 8 and he was going away. But she did not grasp the meaning.</p>
        <p>''Daddy said 'incarceration,' '' recalled Dominique, who knows the word well now that she has spent much of a week within the confines of the prison that has kept her father, convicted of violent assault, 300 miles from her.</p>
        <p>Nine convicts have been free to exchange hugs with their children, some of them hesitantly at first, and to play and advise and gaze upon them for four hours each morning this week. Sharing thoughts and meals, they tested a program, as merciful as it is experimental, to let 11 children and their imprisoned fathers directly repair family ties.</p>
        <p>Small scenes of joy -- fathers and children making cutouts and paintings together, laughing, embracing, airing difficult problems, sometimes crying -- are hidden from society here in the confines of the fathers' home behind bars and razor wire, which they admitted to their children is known as ''the cage.''</p>
        <p>''I would cry when he first went away,'' Dominique said. ''But Daddy would write me letters and tell me always do my homework.''</p>
        <p>In the midst of his 6- to 18-year sentence, her father, Alonzo Thompson, found himself lying down hand-in-hand with Dominique this morning on the floor of the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center's visitors' room, where each father and child had their own piece of silhouette paper on which to trace their outlines for a life-size mural of their reunion.</p>
        <p>''That's my heart right there,'' Mr. Thompson said of his daughter as she colored in fanciful details of the two of them and made the fingers securely overlap.</p>
        <p>Their laughter never made it outside to this gray city of burned-out steel mills. Youngstown is quietly becoming the prison capital of a nation that, to use Dominique's hard-learned word, is now the world leader in incarceration. Five prisons operate here with about 40,000 inmates; two more are on the way. Many of the prisoners are young fathers with plenty of time to ponder long lists of regrets, with their children, often little known and less seen, at the top of those lists.</p>
        <p>In this prison, there is even a class on being a parent for clueless fathers. Jeanette Jenkins, a stalwart mother of six, grandmother of seven and retired prison guard, fervidly teaches the convicts that they still have the responsibility, and the power, to inspire their far-off children along the straight and narrow.</p>
        <p>''It's going to hurt when my boy goes back home, and I just may cry, you know what I'm saying?'' admitted DeWayne Mixon, a hulking 32-year-old convict in his sixth year of a nine-year assault sentence. His 9-year-old son, Diamond, nudged him as they painted the record of themselves, together once more.</p>
        <p>''This week spoiled me, but it tells me I got to put all the old nonsense behind me and do the right thing,'' said Mr. Mixon, his face a mask of paternal delight and worry. ''It's time to be a father, you know what I'm saying?''</p>
        <p>The parenting experiment originated with an inmates'-rights volunteer, Carol Fennelly, who followed 1,300 inmates here when they were moved three years ago from a condemned prison in Lorton, Va., a Washington suburb. Now an overnight trip away from their families, the inmates suffered a severe drop-off in family visits.</p>
        <p>''Most people don't care about prison inmates; there's not even a debate any more about rehabilitation,'' said Ms. Fennelly, who settled here and opened Hope House, a one-woman volunteer program for which she is constantly begging contributions. ''But people care about children, so I thought maybe this way society will pay a little more attention to the problems of prison.''</p>
        <p>Inspired by the pioneering children's programs for convicts at the women's prison in Bedford Hills, N.Y., Ms. Fennelly did some research and found that criminals behind bars who happened to be fathers were of no special concern to anyone. She created a teleconferencing hookup between here and two Washington churches where fathers can see and talk with their offspring. Then she had inmates read stories onto cassettes so their voices might soothe their children back home.</p>
        <p>These programs, and the children's visits this week, might have died as proposals in a typical state-run prison, Ms. Fennelly said. The Northeast center is run by a private company, the Corrections Corporation of America.</p>
        <p>''Strong family affection -- what these guys have to live for -- can get lost,'' Brian Gardner, the prison warden, said of the long distance that discourages many families.</p>
        <p>''I missed a lot of her important years,'' Ricky Walker, a 36-year-old father doing 7 to 21 years for second-degree murder, said of his 13-year-old daughter, Dominique. ''I last saw her when she was 9. I remember carrying her around on my shoulders, and now look: she's a young lady who doesn't disrespect no one.''</p>
        <p>Dominique found the medium-security prison frightening when she first approached it, but she forged ahead from clanging gate to steel door, fulfilling her childhood mission. ''I missed him a lot these years; we were so close before he left,'' she said, remarking, as other youngsters also did, that the fathers had been sternly lecturing their children on how to stay out of trouble.</p>
        <p>''If I go back and do the same things I can't expect anyone to come visit me, not if I forever play the fool,'' said Mr. Walker.</p>
        <p>Nearby, DeWayne Mixon looked up from his painting to beam upon the son at his side. Lolling and smiling, the two might as well have been fishing on a lake.</p>
        <p>''Wonderful, first time I've seen Diamond in five years,'' Mr. Mixon said. ''It's taking the frustration out of me. I'm loving him, and he knows where I'm at and why I'm here. I been telling him wrongdoing gets you in prison, and don't follow in my footsteps.''</p>
        <p>But the boy never seemed more than hand-holding distance from the man. Diamond happily sounded as if he had forgotten nothing across the lost five years of his father's life.</p>
        <p>''He didn't have no beard when he left, and he bites his nails now,'' Diamond said, smiling at his father.</p>
        <p>During this day's visit, the prison carried out its required head count discreetly, with no lineup to demean the fathers in front of their children. Their white prison uniforms were daubed with some of the day's fun when Ms. Fennelly finally gathered the children to leave. Diamond playfully resisted, even with the promise of an afternoon swim waiting out in the world of the free.</p>
        <p>''You going back in that cage with me?'' his father gently growled, grateful for the gesture but surely knowing the answer.</p>
