        <p>OPEN-AIR movie screenings have flickered around the city for years, popping up on sheets strung up in Little Italy, or gently bobbing on Pier 63, a barge in Chelsea. But the grande dame of outside cinema is the annual film festival in Bryant Park.</p>
        <p>This year's theme is Hollywood classics. On Monday evenings, thousands of people gather on the park's tidy green lawn in the heart of the murmuring metropolis.</p>
        <p>On a recent evening, 10,000 unrowdy people turned out for the goofball antics of the Marx Brothers' ''Duck Soup.'' They arrived by twos and twenties, bearing picnic baskets and Zabar's bags, some with lovers' eyes, others with the darting, flirting glances of the young and single.</p>
        <p>''It's the most mellow crowd you'll find in New York,'' said Steven Pearl, who moved here from Boston in 1991. ''It's like a mellow rock concert.''</p>
        <p>This warm-air ritual has rituals of its own: arriving early, staking out land with blankets or string, defending your turf with a wilting New York look.</p>
        <p>Then there's the problem of finding friends. Some use old-fashioned methods, like flying flags, balloons or streamers. Others wander around calling names. One man stood motionless with a sign that said simply, ''Jess!''</p>
        <p>But the most popular way to find friends is the newest: cell phones chirped around the green like a mad covey of crickets.</p>
        <p>''We're sitting near a Finnish flag, so when people call us, we say to look for that,'' said Amanda Bennett, who also uses e-mail to send the film schedule to friends.</p>
        <p>Under the Finnish flag, Americans and Finns belonging to a group called FUN  (Finnish Urban Network) ate and drank as they waited for Groucho. In Finland, there are no outdoor movies. ''It doesn't get dark in summer,'' Tiina Karhapaa said. ''And in winter, it's way too cold.''</p>
        <p>A model of a skull was perched above the flag. ''The Finns look for the flag and the Americans look for the skull,'' said Reid Gray, who made the model. ''It actually glows in the dark. So we take it down when the movie starts.''</p>
        <p>The start of the movie brought yet another ritual. As the promotional music for the event's sponsor, HBO, began, hundreds of people slowly rose from the darkened lawn and then burst into a flailing dance.</p>
        <p>Jeff McLeod, a film student, said he liked to get it going. ''Last summer, more people did it each week, until the final night, when practically everyone in the park was up dancing,'' he said. Will he return? ''I have to be here. My people need me.''</p>
