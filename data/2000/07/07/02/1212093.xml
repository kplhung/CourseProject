        <p>Mark and Susan Leitner of Katonah can now sleep a little better. They have settled their claim against Nationwide Insurance for their house, which was destroyed by Hurricane Floyd in September.</p>
        <p>Initially, Nationwide denied the claim, saying the damage was caused by a mudslide, which was not covered by their policy. Unable to rebuild, the Leitners were forced to move to a rented house while they continued to pay $3,140 a month in mortgage and taxes on a house that was gone.</p>
        <p>''At least they got some money from the insurance company to keep them going,'' their lawyer, Donald N. Silverman, said. He would not reveal the terms of the settlement, but he said it covered only a fraction of the Leitners' loss.</p>
        <p>The Leitners will now join with Nationwide to sue the Town of Bedford for the entire amount of the loss. The Leitners believe their property was flooded, in part, because of an emergency berm that town workers built on the day of the storm to protect houses on a nearby street.</p>
        <p>''This is where we want to be,'' Mr. Leitner said. ''I didn't want to be fighting the insurance company and the town.''</p>
        <p>The Leitners are hoping to rebuild a house on their Katonah lot.</p>
