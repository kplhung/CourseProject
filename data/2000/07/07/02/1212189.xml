        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>If someone somehow didn't know what holiday was rolling up, the small-town parades in villages throughout the Island would provide an abundance of clues.</p>
        <p>And just to make things perfectly clear, there are plenty of fireworks festivities planned. Today, for example, there are displays in Glen Cove's Morgan Park as the city's Waterfront 2000 Festival comes to an end (516) 759-7340; at the ''Millennium Celebration'' that starts at 6 p.m. at Northport Harbor (631) 261-7502; and at Point Lookout Town Park where at 7:30 p.m. Hempstead Town begins ''Veterans Salute'' festivities with the Cornell Gunther Coasters (516) 431-3900.</p>

        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>If someone somehow didn't know what holiday was rolling up, the small-town parades in villages throughout the Island would provide an abundance of clues.</p>

        <p>Tomorrow there are fireworks at the Polo Grounds in Greenport (631) 477-1943, and a fireworks cruise that leaves from Port Washington at 7 p.m. (516) 935-2936.

The American Concert Band performs at 8 p.m. before fireworks at Smith Point County Park in Shirley (631) 399-1511.</p>
        <p>Old Bethpage Village Restoration on Round Swamp Road recreates a Fourth of July celebration, circa 1850, complete with parade, patriotic speeches, military drills and musket firings; period music; children's games, and a ''Temperance Society Picnic,'' from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. today and Tuesday (516) 572-8400.</p>

        <p>At Planting Fields</p>
        <p>With its now-familiar emphasis on pop music and jazz, the Friends of the Arts' Long Island Summer Festival gets under way on Saturday with an appearance by David Benoit, jazz pianist. And before the weekly series ends on Sept. 3 with a nod in the direction of the classics, the one-day Beethoven Festival, performers will include big names as Shawn Colvin (July 22), Patti LuPone (July 29), Little Feat (Aug. 19) and ''A Tribute to Tito Puente'' with the Tito Puente Latin Jazz Ensemble and Bobby Sanabria and Ascension (Aug. 26).</p>
        <p>Once again there is yet another festival within the festival -- the three-day ''Jazz Festival'' featuring Bela Fleck, Aug. 4; the Branford Marsalis Quartet, Aug. 5; and Spyro Gyro, Aug. 6. It all takes place under a tent or on the lawn at Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay (516) 922-0061.</p>
        <p>'Picnic Pops'</p>
        <p>Who says you can't go home again? Certainly not Peter Duchin, who has been associated with Old Westbury Gardens' Picnic Pops Concert Series for the past 22 years and who, as a childhood friend of Nonie Phipps, used to frequent the Phipps estate before it became a park. Mr. Duchin and his orchestra return to the gardens on Wednesday to open this new season, which will depart from its usual mellow big-band format twice to present two Motown greats: the Drifters, July 12, and the Platters, Aug. 2. Music starts at 7 p.m. but the gates open at 5 p.m. for picnicking (516) 333-0048.</p>
        <p>In the Parks</p>
        <p>Devotees of free park concerts could -- with careful planning -- keep busy every night this week when six new series are starting up.  Oyster Bay's 8 o'clock ''Music Under Stars'' concerts begin Wednesday with Dean Karahalis and the Concert Pops of Long Island appearing at Syosset-Woodbury Park, and continues Thursday with the Tom Smith Big Band at Bethpage Community Park; Friday with Peggy Cone and the Central Park Stompers at Tappen Beach in Glenwood Landing; and Saturday with the Something Special Big Band at Post Park in Massapequa (516) 797-7900.</p>
        <p>The Big Band East opens the weekly Southampton series at 6:45 p.m. on Wednesday at Agawam Park (631) 287-4300, while, again on Wednesday, Risky Business appears at 8 p.m. at Oceanside Park in Hempstead Town, which also has ''The King and I'' at Rath Park in Franklin Square on Thursday (516) 489-4849.</p>
        <p>The Isotope Stompers begin the weekly concerts at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday at the Village Green in Westhampton Beach (631) 288-0780. Friday brings Spider Nick and the Maddogs at 7:30 p.m. to the weekly ''Jazz in the Square'' in Glen Cove (516) 759-6970.</p>
        <p>Juke Box Saturday Night starts things off for Babylon Town at 8 p.m. at Phelps Lane Park in North Babylon (631) 893-2119.</p>
        <p>Hamptons Festival</p>
        <p>The Music Festival of the Hamptons opens its fifth season on Friday at 6:30 p.m. with a concert featuring Lukas Foss and Elysium playing works by Haydn, Mozart and Schumann under the Festival Tent on Snakehollow Road in Bridgehampton. On Saturday, in the first of four Family Concerts, Richard Stoltzman and Family performs music by Bach, Debussy, Gershwin and Poulenc at 5 p.m., while next Sunday at 8 p.m. brings ''Mr. Gershwin Goes to Washington,'' a repeat of a 1997 New York Festival of Song concert at Carnegie Hall. Before the festival ends on July 22 there will be cabaret songs by Kurt Weill, July 13; performances by the Atlantic Chamber Orchestra, July 14 and 16; an all-Copland concert, July 15; a recital by Philip Fowke, pianist, July 17; and a closing ''Celebration of Jazz, Broadway and Cabaret,'' July 22 (800) 644-4418.</p>
        <p>Innovative Dance</p>
        <p>With more than four decades of accomplishment in her resume, Trisha Brown is a name in American dance to be reckoned with and enjoyed whenever possible. This possibility comes up Thursday when Ms. Brown and her company begin a residency in Southampton under the aupices of the Parrish Art Museum. From 3 to 4 p.m. Thursday and Friday, they will hold rehearsals open to the public who then gets to see the premiere performance of the finished work at 5 p.m. on Saturday. This all takes place at Agawam Park and is free (631) 283-2118.</p>
        <p>Vanderbilt Birthday</p>
        <p>The Suffolk County Vanderbilt Museum is 50 years old and to celebrate will throw itself a party on Thursday. The complex will be open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and reduced admission of 50 cents a person will enable visitors to tour the Eagles' Nest Mansion with its newly opened servants' quarters and the Marine Museum; join in half-hour family educational programs; catch the sky show, ''Wonders of the Summer Sky,'' at the Planetarium; sit in on a lecture, ''The Mummy''; see William K. Vanderbilt II's 1928 custom-built Lincoln; and, at noon in the Courtyard, hear the recently-restored Mansion Bell Tower ring in the next 50 years. The complex is on Little Neck Road in Centerport (631) 854-5550.</p>
        <p>Star Power</p>
        <p>In a staged reading, complete with sets, costumes and props, today at the Patchogue Theater for the Performing Arts, the actresses Marisa Berenson and Kim Hunter will appear in a ''Shadows in the Sun,'' a play by Lee Davis and J. K. Nelson. This performance of the drama, based on a true story of how memories of the Holocaust affect a reunion of new and old friends on the Costa Brava in the 1960's, and was made possible because the actresses saw the script and ''are really dedicated to this play,'' said Mr. Davis, a Southampton theater critic. The performance is at 2 p.m. at the theater on Main Street (631) 286-1133.</p>
        <p>Free Choices</p>
        <p>TODAY -- Performing ''Songs of the Sea,'' Spindrift appears at 3:30 p.m. at the Horton Point Lighthouse on Lighthouse Road in Southold (631) 765-3722.</p>
        <p>FRIDAY -- The Nassau Pops, joined by Emily Nadler-Klein and Jack Cassin, vocalists, and under Louis Panacciulli's baton, play pop and light classical favorites at 8 p.m. in Memorial Park in Mineola (516) 565-0646.</p>
        <p>SATURDAY -- Tour an old burial ground with Dr. Gaynell Stone, an archaeologist and maven on Colonial gravestones, at 4 p.m. via the Bridge Hampton Historical Society on Main Street (631) 537-1088.</p>
