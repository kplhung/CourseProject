        <p>THEY'RE known as incubators -- but one venture capitalist now calls them incinerators.</p>
        <p>The high-technology bounty of the last few years yielded a small crop of these companies, which nurture nascent Internet start-ups, then spin them out or sell them as they mature. Among the best-known publicly traded incubators are CMGI of Andover, Mass., and the Internet Capital Group and Safeguard Scientifics, both of Wayne, Pa.</p>
        <p>But as the technology market has come down to earth, some people are questioning the very rationale behind taking public what is essentially a venture capital firm.</p>
        <p>One major problem is that the core business operation of the incubators -- launching their portfolio companies into the public markets -- has lost much of its allure in recent months, as offerings have been postponed or canceled and as first-day gains have shrunk considerably.</p>
        <p>And Wall Street in general has become less receptive to the kind of companies that most incubators are nurturing -- early-stage businesses with big ideas but no products or profits. So the ''time to market'' has lengthened for many Internet companies in the incubators' portfolios.  This means that the risk of owning these companies has increased while the real value of an incubator's investments has decreased sharply.</p>
        <p>Roger McNamee, a general partner at Integral Capital Partners, noted that while the public market is a beguiling source of low-cost capital for these incubators, it comes at a steep price -- time horizons and expectations that are incompatible with a venture capital firm.</p>
        <p>''Incubators were compelling in 1998, 1999, because the time frame for creating market value in ventures was very short,'' he said. ''If recent trends persist, it will take much longer to build market value in new ventures. This suggests that some incubator funds will ultimately incinerate the capital that goes into them.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, as the technology market has cooled, incubators' share prices have turned icy: CMGI is down 66.9 percent this year through Friday, to $45.8125. Internet Capital has tumbled 78.2 percent, to $37.015625, and Safeguard is down 41 percent, to $32.0625.</p>
        <p>Incubator stocks are viewed by Wall Street as a way to tap into  privately held companies before their initial public offerings. Analysts have typically computed target prices for incubators by tallying the value of the holdings -- for the private companies, they estimated the public value -- and added a premium for good management and for synergies between the holdings.</p>
        <p>A TEST may come soon. Two of the better-known private incubators, Idealab of Pasadena, Calif., and Divine InterVentures of Lisle, Ill., are poised to go public, hoping for a taste of the spectacular Wall Street success enjoyed by companies like Internet Capital in its initial offering last August; its shares were priced at $6 but rose to $200 by Jan. 3.</p>
        <p>But at least one investment bank is wary about the timing. Credit Suisse First Boston had been scheduled to be lead manager for Divine InterVenture's public offering. But last month, after the bank tried to postpone the sale until the fall, Andrew J. Filipowski, chief executive of Divine InterVentures, jettisoned First Boston and hired Robertson Stephens to lead the offering instead. Last week, Divine InterVentures postponed its offering, which is for up to $200.1 million, until next Thursday. Idealab's initial offering, for up to $30 million, is not yet scheduled.</p>
        <p>Despite the credentials of both Mr. Filipowski, a former chief executive of Platinum Technology, and Bill Gross, the venture capitalist who is chief executive of Idealab, some analysts are wary about their long-term prospects.</p>
        <p>Another problem for incubators is that they tend to be invested in the kinds of companies that are not in favor at the moment -- those focused on e-commerce, for example.</p>
        <p>''The market is more interested in companies that are making net profits now,'' said Gail Bronson, a senior analyst at IPO Monitor.</p>
        <p>Idealab has a portfolio that includes companies like eToys, whose business model looked much more compelling last year. And Divine InterVentures, like Internet Capital, is focused on business-to-business exchanges, an area that generated much investor enthusiasm late last year but is also cooling because of market saturation.</p>
        <p>By contrast, recent new-issue successes have been in areas like Internet infrastructure.</p>
        <p>''Core technology and infrastructure companies are more likely to attract venture funding immediately and not need the services of an incubator,'' said Ms. Bronson, adding that incubators tend to finance companies at an earlier stage of development than do traditional venture capitalists.</p>
        <p>Incubators may also suffer from competition with other incubators for management teams and ideas. Internet Capital had the first-mover advantage in the business-to-business e-commerce sector, but Divine InterVentures does not.</p>
        <p>Moreover, as more incubators go public, they compete with one another for investor capital, possibly driving down their stock prices.</p>
        <p>SO should investors be placing bets on incubators at all? Henry T. C. Hu, a professor at the University of Texas specializing in law and finance, says no, partly because an incubator's public investors do not have access to detailed information about the companies in its portfolio. ''How do you convey to the public how much these opportunities are worth?'' he asked. ''It's very different from the kind of information flow between a venture capitalist and their investors.''</p>
        <p>Compared with a mutual fund, he said, incubators suffer because their holdings are not publicly traded and thus are neither priced by the market nor reflect its movements.</p>
        <p>Others think the incubator model still has value.''The symbiosis between companies is there, and it's real,'' said Phil Leigh, vice president of Internet research at Raymond James, the brokerage firm. It is just that ''one's perception of that value gets overly optimistic in a bull market and gets overly scrutinized in a bear market.''</p>
