        <p>Billy McKinney gets paid when people yell at him, and sometimes the insults cut deep. ''You've got to be like the actor,'' said Mr. McKinney, who responds only with a steely smile when people scream at him. ''You've got to hide the feeling.''</p>
        <p>Nearly every evening, Mr. McKinney sits underneath the scaffolding of the Reuters building, under construction at 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue, and holds a sign that invites people to tell him off for $2.</p>
        <p>In the year and a half that he has been there, he says, he has been cursed at in multiple languages -- and told to get a real job. Mr. McKinney says most people who holler at him do so to relieve stress. They pretend he is their employer, significant other or a friend with whom they have a problem.</p>
        <p>''Some people do it, and they feel better after they do it,'' Mr. McKinney said.</p>
        <p>But most of his customers are foreign tourists who do not hurl insults at him. They just take pictures as he sits in his lawn chair, wearing only black jeans, black sunglasses and an Afro wig and holding his quintessentially New York sign.</p>
        <p>A native of Little Rock, Ark., Mr. McKinney, 51, says that he has worked odd jobs for most of his life, including stints as a street vendor, a janitor and a panhandler in cities from San Francisco to Miami. But his new gig offers better hours and much more amusement.</p>
        <p>''It took me a while to come up with it,'' said Mr. McKinney, who is homeless. ''I don't know where such a thought came from, but once I got it, I expanded it.''</p>
        <p>When he arrived in New York just over a year ago, he survived by displaying a sign that said ''will work for food.'' But Mr. McKinney said the sign did not work so he changed it to ''Tell me off for 50 cents.'' The new concept worked so well that he raised his fee to $1 before finally settling on $2 because, he said, he could not buy anything with $1.</p>
        <p>And just how much money does he make?</p>
        <p>''I usually don't like to tell people that because it sets you up for the stickup guys,'' Mr. McKinney said. But he revealed that most days he earned $15 to $20. He says he has made as much as $40 in one day.</p>
        <p>When Gail Cirillo and her friends plunked down their money to talk to Mr. McKinney, insults were not a part of the conversation.  ''We thought instead of telling him off, that we would tell him something that he could really use: that God loves him and that Christ died for him,'' she said. ''It's certainly much better than getting told off.''</p>
