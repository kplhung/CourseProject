        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You reported on June 11 that petitions are being circulated to change East 163rd Street in the Bronx to Big Pun Avenue (''Rapper Lives in His Music, and Maybe in a Street Name''). How about changing East 142nd Street to Piccirilli Avenue?</p>
        <p>The six Piccirilli brothers, all magnificent sculptors, had the largest studio in America at that location from the 1890's until 1945 -- where they carved the Lincoln Memorial, the Public Library lions and hundreds of monuments throughout the city and nation, from small plaster models supplied to them by the name sculptors of the day, who were incapable of carving in marble or stone. In addition there were many original works like the Firemen's Memorial on Riverside Drive and the Maine Memorial at Columbus Circle.</p>

        <p>What will it take to make our politicians memorialize this past treasure in some way? Or will the Bronx's cultural claim to fame remain only Poe's cottage and maybe Big Pun Avenue?</p>
