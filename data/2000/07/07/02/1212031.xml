        <p>A firetruck struck and fatally injured an elderly woman yesterday morning on the Lower East Side as it sped to the scene of a blaze, fire officials said.</p>
        <p>The truck, from Engine Company 15, was turning from Madison Street onto Rutgers Street when it struck the 80-year-old woman, Ngor Tong Shiu, who was crossing Rutgers. She crumpled onto a manhole cover about five feet from the crosswalk, witnesses said. The truck immediately backed up into the intersection, and firefighters scrambled out.</p>
        <p>Three firefighters hovered over the woman, checking her pulse and holding her to keep her from moving, witnesses said. An ambulance arrived in about five minutes and took her to Bellevue Hospital Center, where doctors pronounced her dead shortly after 3 p.m.</p>
        <p>The truck was responding to a fire at 11:32 a.m. in a second-floor apartment at the La Guardia Houses, a low-income housing development at 45 Rutgers Street. The truck left the station at 269 Henry Street and sped down Madison Street, sirens wailing, before rounding the corner onto Rutgers, officials said.</p>
        <p>Police and fire officials were investigating the accident. The police did not issue any citations for violations.</p>
        <p>''It was an accident, it wasn't intentional,'' said Warren Jones, who saw the accident from a bench outside the La Guardia Houses. ''It's nobody's fault.''</p>
        <p>The block of Rutgers Street where the accident took place lies near the Manhattan Bridge. The high-rise Rutgers Houses and La Guardia Houses are on either side of the street.</p>
        <p>''Firetrucks, they just run through here,'' said Curtis James, a resident of Rutgers Houses.</p>
        <p>But Firefighter Mike Prendergast, a Fire Department spokesman, said the truck was simply responding to a fire.</p>
        <p>The truck returned to the station soon after the accident. Thirteen other trucks and almost 60 firefighters remained to fight the blaze, Firefighter Prendergast said. The fire was brought under control around noon, soon after firefighters broke the window of Apartment 2C and doused the flames inside.</p>
        <p>Ethel Moore, who lived in the apartment with her 21-year-old granddaughter, was visiting a friend across the street when the fire broke out. Maintenance workers said the blaze probably began because of an electrical problem.</p>
        <p>''The only thing I have belonging to me is what I have on,'' Ms. Moore said as she sat on a bench clutching a shopping bag with clothing given to her by a neighbor.</p>
