        <p>IN its understated way, Britain is the Edward I. Koch of nations, endlessly wondering ''How'm I doing?'' But unlike Mr. Koch, the self-congratulating former mayor of New York, Britain rarely expects a positive answer. And lately, a nation that is always sensitive about perceived slights to its international status has found more than usual to be upset about.</p>
        <p>Not only did CBS News recently report that some crime in England is far worse than in the United States, but England's soccer team ignominiously lost to Romania  (Romania!) in the Euro 2000 tournament. Then, the country's No. 2 tennis player, Greg Rusedski, was blown out of Wimbledon on opening day by Vincent Spadea, an American known to British newspapers as ''the world's biggest loser'' because he had lost 22 of his last 22 matches.</p>
        <p>And now along comes ''The Patriot,'' a film about the American Revolution that presents the English as effete war criminals with snobby accents who herd families of fledgling Americans into barns and set them on fire, just for fun. To Britons sick of being pushed around, this obnoxious affront to retrospective pride may be the last straw.</p>
        <p>The film hasn't even opened here yet, but the newspapers have been full of outrage at what they see as wanton disregard for the historical record. Maybe the war was dirty and violent at times, they say, but their soldiers certainly never shot children or minced around in the creepy manner of Nazi generals. And it's no accident that Mel Gibson stars in the film, they say -- he's Australian.</p>
        <p>''As every Hollywood casting agent knows, the devil speaks with an English accent,'' Neil Norman wrote in The Evening Standard, deploring how ''to a man, the dastardly English are presented as heartless toffs and Machiavels, war criminals and child-killers.''</p>
        <p>Why do the British persist in casting everything in terms of national pride? Shouldn't they just lighten up?</p>
        <p>''We have a significant pride in what we achieved in the past with regard to the British empire, and we don't like to see it unfairly traduced,'' explained the British historian Andrew Roberts. This puffed-up feeling about the past, he said, is inextricably linked to a sadly deflated view of the present.</p>
        <p>''What is there to be proud of?'' he asked, musing crossly about the European Union.  ''What are we doing now? We're getting sucked into some amorphous European superstate, largely against our will. As a nation we haven't achieved much since 1945, and the things that we are rightly proud of are being taken away from us by the distortions of a foreign entertainment industry.''</p>
        <p>''The Patriot,'' of course, is just one in a recent series of Hollywood slights perpetrated on the British -- and more specifically, the English. There were the Englishmen in ''Titanic,'' who battened down the hatches to prevent the declasse, mostly Irish, lower-deck passengers from escaping. Then there was Anthony Hopkins, the repellant hissing villain in ''The Silence of the Lambs.'' And don't forget Mr. Gibson's ''Braveheart,'' in which the English are shown raping, slaughtering and pillaging their way through 13th-century Scotland.</p>
        <p>More worryingly, Britons don't figure in ''U-571,'' a recent film starring Matthew McConaughey as the leader of a band of Americans on a submarine who capture the German Enigma code-making machine in World War II. In real life, the Americans didn't capture the code -- the British did.</p>
        <p>It wasn't always this way. Before the Communists, when the Nazis were still the worst villains, World War II movies regularly showed the British and Americans working together to repel the heinous Germans.</p>
        <p>''Up until quite recently, films made in America were on the whole quite admiring of the British and British history,'' said Jeffrey Richards, a professor of cultural history at the University of Lancaster. Since then, he said, the British film market has virtually disappeared, and Hollywood no longer cares whether it alienates British viewers.</p>
        <p>THE British are feeling alienated a lot these days. But no matter what other people say about them, it's not as bad as what they say about themselves -- particularly when they lose at sports.</p>
        <p>''We have this absurd obsession with sport,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''Even though, since 1967, we've been beaten at all the sports we invented, after 30 years we still get into great emotional upsets. The things we should be looking at seriously are things like Britain's great economy, but instead we get into a huge tussle about whether Greg Rusedski has a good day at Wimbledon.''</p>
        <p>When the unfortunate Rusedski lost to Spadea, the hapless American who had been touring the world losing one match after another for eight months, The Times of London just couldn't control itself.</p>
        <p>''When you are on a 22 match, world-record losing streak,'' it wrote, ''there is only one person capable of ending your misery: a British sports star.''</p>
