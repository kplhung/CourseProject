        <p>MONTE WARNE is a down-home Renaissance man, a Michelangelo of machinery: a licensed aircraft and airplane-engine mechanic, an aircraft designer, a licensed private, commercial and crop-duster pilot, a lifelong motorcyclist and a former motorcycle and car racer. So what possessed him to build the outrageous Boss Hoss, a motorcycle with a Corvette V-8 engine?</p>
        <p>It all began in 1998 when Mr. Warne picked up a new Harley-Davidson Heritage Softail in Memphis. By the time he drove it 75 miles home to Dyersburg, Tenn., he decided that it had too much vibration and not enough power. He sold it with just 500 miles on the odometer.</p>

        <p>MONTE WARNE is a down-home Renaissance man, a Michelangelo of machinery: a licensed aircraft and airplane-engine mechanic, an aircraft designer, a licensed private, commercial and crop-duster pilot, a lifelong motorcyclist and a former motorcycle and car racer. So what possessed him to build the outrageous Boss Hoss, a motorcycle with a Corvette V-8 engine?</p>
        <p>It all began in 1998 when Mr. Warne picked up a new Harley-Davidson Heritage Softail in Memphis. By the time he drove it 75 miles home to Dyersburg, Tenn., he decided that it had too much vibration and not enough power. He sold it with just 500 miles on the odometer.</p>
        <p>That winter, with time on his hands, $10,000 in his pocket and an idea in his head, he decided to build his own motorcycle. He took a modified Chevy engine out of his race car, put it on the shop floor and tried to figure out how to build a motorcycle around it.</p>
        <p>He used steel tubing for the frame, a widened Harley-Davidson Fat Bob fuel tank, a Harley-Davidson front end and a right-angle gearbox from a lawn mower to get the power to the rear wheel via a foot-operated clutch and chain drive. He used a 12-inch-wide Hoosier dirt-track racing tire at the rear, a modified Harley rear suspension and the rear disc brake from a 1982 Dodge Colt.</p>
        <p>That first bike overheated, so he had a special radiator built. It rode hard, so he reduced the tire's air pressure from 40 pounds per square inch to just 12. The Harley front forks flexed so badly under the V-8's weight that he had to reinforce them. And that was the beginning of the mechanical evolution that led to the Boss Hoss.</p>
        <p>Within days, bikers around Dyersburg started asking Mr. Warne to build frame kits so they could create their own Chevy-powered bikes. He built another V-8 bike during the crop-dusting off-season in 1990 and took both his creations to Florida in 1991, to the annual Daytona Bike Week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warne says the presence of the loud, brawny V-8 bikes in Daytona Beach caused a near-riot of spectators and photographers. But if the Boss Hosses attracted the police, they also got the attention of the motorcycle press. Mr. Warne sold the first two bikes, and would-be customers started to call.</p>
        <p>In Dyersburg, he sold both his crop-dusting business and a local racetrack that he and his wife, Meredith, operated. They started Boss Hoss Motorcycles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warne and his employees (there are 22 now) have since built 2,000 Boss Hosses for well-heeled riders around the world. Celebrity buyers include Jay Leno, the ''Tonight Show'' host; Mark Martin, the Winston Cup racer (whose bike is painted like his red, white and blue Valvoline Taurus race car); Sammy Swindell, the World of Outlaws racer who modified his bike with his own engine; Vince McMahon, the World Wrestling Federation impresario; and Stone Cold Steve Austin, the wrestler.</p>
        <p>Riders must straddle the big engines, but Mr. Warne says the seating position is similar to a Harley's, with the feet about 22 inches apart. Nor is the weight a problem except when parking; once the bike is in gear, the engine's torque melts the pounds away.</p>
        <p>The Boss Hoss has evolved through several generations. The 2000 model uses a 350-cubic-inch, 355-horsepower engine shipped from General Motors ready to install. (By contrast, the world's most powerful conventional motorcycle, Kawasaki's new ZX-12R Ninja, makes 183 horsepower.) The production Boss Hoss uses a specially built, foot-shifted two-speed automatic transmission with a reverse gear -- it comes in handy if you're trying to get a 1,100-pound motorcyle out of a parking space -- and a Gates belt drive similar to those in Harleys.</p>
        <p>The Boss Hoss uses three gigantic Wilwood racing disc brakes, two at the front and one at the rear, and Avon motorcycle tires. Even with the V-8's power, the bike gets 30 miles to the gallon, Mr. Warne said, and can go 300 miles on a tank of fuel.</p>
        <p>The Boss Hoss meets federal regulations and is sold in 49 states, with California to be added as soon as the bike passes the state's emissions test.</p>
        <p>For the truly power-hungry for whom 355 horsepower isn't enough (or, some bikers might suggest, for the truly insane), the Boss Hoss can be ordered with a 502-cubic-inch, 500-horsepower G.M. engine. If either V-8 sounds like a bit much, you can order a bike with a 4.3-liter V-6, also from G.M., with a mere 200 horsepower. If you'd like a more stable platform, there are three-wheeled Boss Hoss ''trikes'' with rear ends that resemble either a '57 Chevy or a '64 Corvette. Trikes, too, can be had with V-6, 350 V-8 or 502 V-8 engines. Prices start at $25,500 for the basic two-wheeled V-6 and go up to $38,000 for the 502 trike.</p>
        <p>Every Boss Hoss is painted to the customer's specifications, so no two are alike. There are 40 dealers in the United States, plus a network in several other countries.</p>
