        <p>The witnesses to two epic matches today left the All England Club with their tennis addictions sufficiently stuffed.

        <p>The witnesses to two epic matches today left the All England Club with their tennis addictions sufficiently stuffed. Just after Mark Philippoussis broke the tension on Court 2 by winning a near-record 20-18 fifth set, Martina Navratilova exited the grounds after losing the final set of her wrenching mixed doubles match, 18-16.</p>
        <p>Each match dripped with drama. The end to Philippoussis' day finally arrived when a backhand return by Sjeng Schalken died into the net to end a 5-hour-1-minute match that was over after a fifth set that lasted 2:15.</p>
        <p>Although it was the longest match in memory to be played on one day, the finish fell short of the 46 total games for a set that Nicola Pietrangeli and Nikki Pilic needed to end a second-round match in 1962. The epic third-round victory by Philippoussis ended with this mind-boggling score: 4-6, 6-3, 6-7 (7), 7-6 (4), 20-18.</p>
        <p>''I just hung in there, and stayed mentally tough,'' said Philippoussis, who served 44 aces in the match. Afterward, Tim Henman, who won in straight sets today, smiled as he asked Philippoussis, ''What took you so long?''</p>
        <p>Philippoussis said: ''He was laughing when I came in. He went on from my match at one-love in the fifth. When he came off, it was 16-all. Obviously, I wasn't laughing. I was bleeding, blood on my shorts. Felt like I'd just been punched to death for five hours.''</p>
        <p>The length of the day was far more than Navratilova bargained for when she decided to return to Wimbledon after a five-year absence to play doubles. Earlier in the afternoon, she and her doubles partner, Mariaan de Swardt, won a three-set match. As darkness fell, Navratilova and her mixed doubles partner, Mahesh Bhupathi, were locked into a three-hour drama against Jan Siemerink and Miriam Oremans. On match point, Bhupathi sent a backhand into the net to finish off the evening, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 18-16.</p>
        <p>The break for Philippoussis came at 18-18 when he converted on a triple break point with an inside-outside forehand down the line. He then served out for the match.</p>
        <p>''I've always considered myself a fighter,'' said Philippoussis, who will play Henman in the next round. ''That was a good match for me.''</p>
        <p>The Return of Borg</p>
        <p>The pomp and pageantry of the Millennium Parade of Champions unfolded today. Among the past winners of Wimbledon to grace Center Court, Bjorn Borg made his first appearance on the grounds since 1981.</p>
        <p>''Show how much we've missed him,'' the master of ceremonies said as the crowd erupted. Just before his introduction, Borg kissed the baseline.</p>
        <p>Most noticeably absent? Jimmy Connors. ''I can't figure out where he's coming from,'' Martina Navratilova said. ''Jimmy's weird.''</p>
        <p>Stop the Music</p>
        <p>As a band played during the champions parade on nearby Center Court, an irritated Jennifer Capriati was morphing into the parent of a teen on Court 3: Hey, turn it down. She could not concentrate on Yayuk Basuki.</p>
        <p>Down by 5-2 in the first set of her third-round match, Capriati called for a referee and asked that someone cut off the band that was escorting in the past champions.</p>
        <p>''I just said, 'What's going on? Can they turn off the music?' '' Capriati said. ''He said they were pretty much done in 10 minutes. I said, 'Well, in 10 minutes, I could be down a set and a half already. I don't have 10 minutes to spare.' He just said that he'd do his best.' ''</p>
        <p>Coincidentally, the music stopped, and Capriati began to play. She staged a blistering rally to barge past Basuki, 7-6 (4), 6-0. Basuki told reporters from Indonesia that she was displeased when Capriati interrupted play to call a referee, and believed Capriati showed disrespect by breaking her momentum.</p>
        <p>''It was fair,'' Capriati said. ''I have every right to call the referee. It was on a changeover. It's as important as calling for an injury timeout to me. It stopped the music, so I'm not concerned with that.''</p>
        <p>Her next step will be difficult. In the Round of 16, she will face second-seeded Lindsay Davenport.</p>
        <p>Things Can Change</p>
        <p>Although she is considered one of the best-liked players on the WTA Tour now, Monica Seles can somewhat relate to the hazing experiences Alexandra Stevenson said she encountered during her rookie year on the tour.</p>
        <p>''I think my first year, there were two players on the tour, and for whatever reason, they didn't like me,'' Seles said without naming names. ''They were the players who talked a lot on the tour to other players. I was 14 or 15, really in my own shell. I just said, 'Hi,' and 'Bye,' and looked down at the floor. I was very shy. I think that's how people perceived me in the beginning.</p>
        <p>''By the time I was 18, they realized I was different. I changed probably as a person, too. I was much more open. I wasn't as shy as I was when I was 14.''</p>
