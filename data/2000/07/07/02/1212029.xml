      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>It wasn't a civil action but a civil war. That is how Dan Zegart of Titusville, in Mercer County, characterizes the legal crusade against big tobacco that he followed for five years and recounted in a book that is, in fact, titled ''Civil Warriors.'' A main warrior is Ron Motley of South Carolina, who had made a fortune suing asbestos manufacturers and promised his mother, a lifelong smoker dying of emphysema, that he would punish those responsible for her death. What followed is a tale of other determined lawyers, secret informers (one is called Deep Cough) and scientists willing to tell the truth about the tobacco companies who had employed them. Many of these people received death threats, and some scientists were advised by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to check their cars for bombs every morning. Mr. Zegart traveled with the lawyers and looked at thousands of pages of documents, weaving it all in with courtroom drama that reads like a novel. ''Civil Warriors,'' published in hard cover by Bantam Dell, is $25.95.</p>
