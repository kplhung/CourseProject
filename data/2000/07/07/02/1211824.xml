        <p>As a makeup artist, Leslie Lopez likes to have her way with color. When it comes to covering the faces of celebrities like Catherine Zeta-Jones and Cameron Diaz, Ms. Lopez is known for her less-is-more, natural touch. But her closet couldn't be more flamboyant. ''It looks like a parrot,'' she said, adding, ''I'm Cuban. We're colorful people. Color gives you flavor.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lopez never hesitates to sample new flavors by taking a favorite dress or cashmere sweater, bleaching out the color and dying it to another vibrant hue.</p>

        <p>As a makeup artist, Leslie Lopez likes to have her way with color. When it comes to covering the faces of celebrities like Catherine Zeta-Jones and Cameron Diaz, Ms. Lopez is known for her less-is-more, natural touch. But her closet couldn't be more flamboyant. ''It looks like a parrot,'' she said, adding, ''I'm Cuban. We're colorful people. Color gives you flavor.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lopez never hesitates to sample new flavors by taking a favorite dress or cashmere sweater, bleaching out the color and dying it to another vibrant hue.</p>
        <p>Here, she wears a slip dress by Ghost that is five years old and has undergone a rainbow of transformations. (Similar styles are sold at Ghost, 28 Bond Street, at Lafayette Street.)</p>
        <p>The dress started out red, but after a season Ms. Lopez reached for a container of liquid Rit fabric dye and turned it canary yellow. A month ago, she took out the yellow, dunked the dress into fuchsia and tie-dyed a few splotches of violet.</p>
        <p>She dresses up the hippie-dippy look with silver bangles and oversize hoop earrings, available at Hotel Venus, at 382 West Broadway, near Broome Street, for $12 to $20, and nude leather high-heel thongs by Manolo Blahnik, $455.</p>
