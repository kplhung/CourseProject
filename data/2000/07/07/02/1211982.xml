        <p>With a strong but not dominating ride, Lance Armstrong opened the defense of his championship today in a Tour de France that was shaken just hours before the start by the ouster of three riders for failing a blood test that hints at the use of illegal drugs.</p>
        <p>The winner of all three time trials in the last Tour, Armstrong finished second. The man ahead of him, by two seconds over a 16.5-kilometer (10-mile) flat course, was David Millar, 23, a Scot riding in his first Tour de France.</p>
        <p>Millar, who rides for the Cofidis team in France, was both thrilled and overwhelmed by his victory, bursting into tears when Armstrong, the American leader of the U.S. Postal Service team and the last man to start, crossed the line. ''I don't believe it,'' Millar said, looking sincere in his disbelief.</p>
        <p>There was a lot not to believe as the 87th Tour began its three-week, 3,660-kilometer (2,274-mile) journey counterclockwise around France. The three disqualifications and the shadow they cast over the Tour ranked atop the list.</p>
        <p>The riders disqualified today were Sergei Ivanov, 25, who won the Russian national championship last Sunday for the second consecutive year; Rossano Brasi, 28, an Italian; and Andrei Hauptman, 25, a Slovene. Ivanov rides for the Farm Frites team from the Netherlands, Brasi for the Polti team from Italy and Hauptman for the Vini Caldirola team from Italy.</p>
        <p>With no immediate right of appeal, the riders were suspended from the sport for 15 days by the International Cycling Union, which governs the sport. About a half-dozen riders have been similarly punished each year since the blood tests were introduced in 1997, but this was a first in the Tour de France, the world's most prestigious bicycle race.</p>
        <p>Jean-Marie Leblanc, who directs the race, said: ''I'm glad the cheaters were caught. This shows that the rules are working.''</p>
        <p>Similar views were expressed by other officials, who seemed determined not to have the case blight opening day.</p>
        <p>The race was disrupted and nearly collapsed in 1998 when a drug scandal resulted in the expulsion of one team and the withdrawal of five others to protest police searches for illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Since then, the Tour and the sport itself have tried to regain public confidence by developing new tests to detect drugs.</p>
        <p>The announcement of the disqualifications followed by a day a public warning by Leblanc that any rider tempted to use drugs in the Tour was ''playing with fire and risking his reputation.'' Although blood tests can be administered at any time during the race, the one today was part of the official schedule.</p>
        <p>''The test was no surprise, no secret,'' said Martin Bruin, a Dutchman who heads the drug inspection team sent to the Tour by the International Cycling Union, which governs the sport. ''The test was scheduled, and everybody knew we were coming to test them.''</p>
        <p>Inspectors, whom the riders always refer to as the vampires, arrived at each of the 20 teams' hotels between 7 and 8:45 this morning to draw blood from the crook of each rider's arm.</p>
        <p>The blood is tested to determine the hematocrit level -- the number of red corpuscles.</p>
        <p>A level higher than 50 percent sends a rider home for two weeks ''to regain his health,'' as the rules put it since the International Cycling Union insists that the inspection is a health test, not one for drugs.</p>
        <p>Even so, a hematocrit level above 50 percent indicates the use of EPO, an artificial hormone developed for patients on kidney dialysis to increase their red-blood corpuscles. These carry oxygen to muscles and thus increase performance in such endurance sports as bicycle racing, rowing, marathon running and long-distance skiing.</p>
        <p>Among the 180 riders tested this morning was, of course, Millar, who is an outspoken advocate of clean racing. He is also a fine time-trialer and was among a handful of favorites for this first of 21 daily stages since he won a similar race against the clock -- flat and nearly the same distance -- two weeks ago in the Route du Sud, his final preparation race.</p>
        <p>Just Friday night, having a beer with some friends, he was marveling at the size and scope of the Tour de France, which he was seeing for the first time.</p>
        <p>''I can't believe it,'' he said, unknowingly rehearsing his speech before he donned the leader's yellow jersey.</p>
        <p>He finished the stage in 19 minutes 3 seconds and said he was hoping to break 18 minutes over the straightforward course in cool and overcast weather. Armstrong was two seconds slower, with Laurent Jalabert, a Frenchman with ONCE, third, 13 seconds behind the winner, and Jan Ullrich, a German with Telekom who won the Tour in 1997, fourth, 14 seconds late.</p>
        <p>''I'm a little disappointed,'' Armstrong said, ''but I'm happy that David won. He's a good friend of mine and a good guy.''</p>
        <p>Among the favorites who lost more than a minute were Franck Vandenbroucke, a Belgian with Cofidis, Bobby Julich, an American with Credit Agricole, Michael Boogerd, a Dutchman with Rabobank, and Richard Virenque, a Frenchman with Polti. Marco Pantani, an Italian with Mercatone Uno and the winner of the 1998 Tour, lost more than two minutes.</p>
        <p>Two familiar faces were missing from the race. Chris Boardman, an Englishman with Credit Agricole and the winner of three opening races, was not entered by his team because of illness. And Mario Cipollini, an Italian with Saeco and the king of the sprinters, did not show up,  either, enabling his replacement, Daniel Atienza, a Spaniard, to finish in 158th place among the 177 starters.</p>
