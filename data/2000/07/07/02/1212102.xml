        <p>Awaiting Harry Potter</p>
        <p>Q. Will there be events in England to celebrate the publication of the fourth Harry Potter book? -- Ivan S. Moughton, St. Petersburg, Fla.</p>
        <p>A. There will be quite a bit of fanfare for J. K. Rowling's new book about the adventures of Harry Potter, the young wizard who has generated such a frenzy among younger readers. However, precise details of the events are surrounded by mystery. Even the title of the book will not be officially revealed until Saturday, the day of publication. That is also when a three-day celebratory train tour is scheduled to begin. Bloomsbury, the publisher of the book and the organizer of the tour,  will not reveal details about the train's route and related events until later this week. A spokeswoman suggests that you watch the company's Web site, www.bloomsbury.com.</p>

        <p>Awaiting Harry Potter</p>
        <p>Q. Will there be events in England to celebrate the publication of the fourth Harry Potter book? -- Ivan S. Moughton, St. Petersburg, Fla.</p>
        <p>A. There will be quite a bit of fanfare for J. K. Rowling's new book about the adventures of Harry Potter, the young wizard who has generated such a frenzy among younger readers. However, precise details of the events are surrounded by mystery. Even the title of the book will not be officially revealed until Saturday, the day of publication.

Bloomsbury, the publisher of the book and the organizer of the tour,  will not reveal details about the train's route and related events until later this week. A spokeswoman suggests that you watch the company's Web site, www.bloomsbury.com.</p>
        <p>The steam train, painted red and named the Hogwarts Express (from the train that is featured in the Harry Potter books) will leave London with  J. K. Rowling on board and will travel between London and Scotland on July 8, 9, and 10, with stops for book-signing events along the way.</p>
        <p>On July 17, 18 and 19 the author will sign books in stores around London and in Brighton, on the south coast of England. On July 17, Ms. Rowling will make an appearance at Harrods between 9 and 11 a.m; tickets will be given to the first 750 people to enter the store at door No. 5 in Hans Crescent. Between 1 and 2 p.m., Ms. Rowling will read and autograph books at Waterstones in Piccadilly. Tickets for this event are also limited and must be won in a competition at the shop on July 8 between 8:30 a.m. and 11 p.m. Entrants, 17 years old and under, must answer three Harry Potter-related questions.</p>
        <p>Brest for Families</p>
        <p>Q. I will be in Brest with my wife and sons (14-year-old twins) for a few days and would like information on activities that will appeal to all of us. -- Larry M. Silverten, Hartford</p>
        <p>A. Brest, on Brittany's Atlantic coast, is one of the most important military and commercial ports in France. While little remains of the old city center, which was bombed  during World War II, there are many activities for tourists of all ages, most of them related to Brest's status as a maritime hub.</p>
        <p>The recently expanded and renovated aquarium Oceanopolis, with its three large pavilions recreating tropical, temperate and polar ecosystems, is modeled on the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California. The complex, about 10 minutes from the center of Brest, also houses several restaurants with ocean views.</p>
        <p>Hours are 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission is $13 (calculated at a rate of 6.9 francs to the dollar); $10.15 for children 4 to 12 years old. Information:  (33-2) 98.34.40.40; www.oceanopolis .com.</p>
        <p>Another place worth visiting is the  Maritime Museum, housed in a portion of the Chateau de Brest, a medieval fortress overlooking the harbor.  The museum focuses on the history of Brest and its port, through maps, boat models, paintings and sculptures. A walk between the chateau's towers and outer walls provides panoramic views of the coast and the harbor.</p>
        <p>The museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Admission is $4.20, $2.60 for children under 18. Information: (33-2) 98.22.12.39.</p>
        <p>Several companies offer boat tours around Brest. These vary from one-day excursions to overnight cruises, and all are suitable for families and English speakers. One option is aboard La Recouvrance, a replica of an early 20th-century military schooner. The boat has different itineraries of varying lengths. Information and reservations: (33-2) 98.33.95.40.</p>
        <p>Notre Dame de Rumengol, a boat built in 1945 to transport sand, has been renovated and converted into a tourist boat and was classified a historic monument by the French government in 1990. Smaller than La Recouvrance, this boat tours not only the coast and harbor of Brest but also several nearby rivers, stopping at small fishing ports along the way. Adults $26, children under 18, $15.20. Information: (33-2) 98.20.06.58.</p>
