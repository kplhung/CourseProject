        <p>FLUDD</p>
        <p>By Hilary Mantel.</p>
        <p>181 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Owl/Henry Holt &amp; Company. Paper, $13.</p>
        <p>The disclaimer at the front of Hilary Mantel's novel isn't the typical boilerplate designed to fend off lawsuits on behalf of real persons, living or dead, who just happen to resemble the scum portrayed within. No, hers seems written with a higher authority in mind: ''The church in this story bears some but not much resemblance to the Roman Catholic Church in the real world, c. 1956.'' In other words, be warned: this won't be a flattering portrait.</p>
        <p>''Fludd,'' first published in Britain in 1989, is Mantel's contribution to a long and worthy line -- the English novel of clerical life. But you won't find her black humor or tart irreverence in Trollope, and Fetherhoughton, the grimy village where her story takes place, is a far cry from bucolic Barchester. The townspeople, barely literate cotton-mill workers, rent their identical row houses from the millowners and do their shopping in the Co-op draper, the Co-op general store, the Co-op butcher, the Co-op shoe shop and the Co-op baker. Except for the occasional Protestant family, they worship life-size statues of obscure saints at the soot-encrusted Church of St. Thomas Aquinas and send their lumpish children to the church school. The priest, Father Angwin, is stubbornly behind the times, even for 1956. He's shocked when the bishop brings up the idea of a vernacular Mass. ''Do you mean,'' he says, ''that they could understand what we were saying?'' ''Exactly the point,'' the bishop replies. Angwin's parishioners, he adds, ''have superstitions that would disgrace Sicilian peasants.''</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, he orders Angwin to evict the statues of the minor-league saints. ''You may keep Thomas Aquinas, St. Theresa the Little Flower and the Holy Virgin herself, only try if you can to get her nose repaired.'' Even more ominously, His Corpulence, as Angwin calls the bishop, threatens to send him an assistant, someone more up-to-date. ''The bishop was a modern man,'' the priest reflects, ''and what can you do, against a modern man?''</p>
        <p>Angwin's answer is to retreat further into religious minutiae, losing himself in canonical puzzles: May meat drippings be used to fry fish on Fridays? Why is fortunetelling allowed at Catholic bazaars? Yet hidden behind his ''fidelity in small things'' is a terrible secret: he's a pretender, a priest without faith. One morning 20 years earlier he woke up to find he no longer believed in God. He believes in the Devil, though, because he sees him regularly -- in the person of Judd McEvoy, an apple-cheeked man in a checked cap who runs a tobacconist's shop.</p>
        <p>Admirers of Hilary Mantel's seven other novels will recognize the familiar terrain: a vague crisis takes shape and things start going awry. Good and evil begin choosing up sides. It's a situation ripe for intervention, divine or otherwise. In this case, intervention comes one rainy night when Angwin's housekeeper, Agnes Dempsey, answers a knock at the door.</p>
        <p>''My name is Fludd,'' says the mysterious young man at the threshold, holding what looks like a doctor's black bag. ''I've come to stay.'' Here's the curate at last, Miss Dempsey says to herself, then notices an odd sensation. ''Deep within her, behind her cardigan and her blouse and her petticoat trimmed with scratchy nylon lace, behind her interlock vest and freckled skin, Miss Dempsey sensed a slow movement, a tiny spiral shift of matter, as if, at the very moment the curate spoke, a change had occurred: a change so minute as to baffle description, but rippling out, in its effect, to infinity.'' To her embarrassment, she breaks into song.</p>
        <p>The newcomer has a strange effect on others, too. In his presence, they tend to blurt out the truth, reveal themselves, think aloud. Angwin confesses his loss of faith. The priest's archenemy, Mother Perpetua, headmistress at the school, unlocks an old trunk and gleefully exhibits the worldly undergarments abandoned by postulants at the convent gates. Out of Fludd's presence, people can't seem to remember his face, except for its ''corpse-like pallor.'' When he arrives, ghostly noises that have been haunting the presbytery disappear. And no one actually sees him eat; food simply vanishes from his plate.</p>
        <p>Mantel explains in an author's note that her title character is based on a real person, an English physician, scholar and alchemist who died in 1637. ''In these days,'' she says of the fictional Fludd, ''he no longer worked in metal, but practiced on human nature; an art less predictable, more gratifying, more dangerous.'' ''I think Father Fludd has the gift of prophecy,'' one observer remarks. ''Prophecy doesn't mean telling the future. It means speaking out about the true nature of things.''</p>
        <p>Fludd obliquely reveals his mission in Fetherhoughton to the one person who guesses he's not a real priest: Sister Philomena, a young Irish nun banished from her home country for passing off her dermatitis as marks of the stigmata. His former trade, he tells her, was ''releasing spirit from matter,'' freeing ''the soul trapped in circumstances it can no longer abide.'' ''How do I know that it is not you who is the Devil?'' she replies.</p>
        <p>IN ''Fludd,'' as in her other comic novels, Mantel manages to make us laugh even as our hair stands on end. A particularly nasty gang of nuns, Sister Polycarp, Sister Cyril and Sister Ignatius Loyola, she writes, ''took no exercise, apart from beating small children with canes.'' When they aren't laying waste to Fetherhoughton's youth, they work on a vast tapestry depicting the various plagues of Egypt. ''Now we are up to boils,'' Ignatius says.</p>
        <p>The writing is characteristically Mantel: mordant, pitiless, razor-sharp. ''One priest in a family equals three or four nuns,'' Philomena says. ''That's the way they count in Ireland.'' The sisters rise from prayer, ''peeling off from the kneeler like black adhesive strips.'' In every room of the presbytery, ''a crucifix hung, the dying God in each case exhibiting some distinction of anguish, some greater or lesser contortion of his naked body, a musculature more or less racked. The house was a prison for these dying Christs, a mausoleum.''</p>
        <p>I won't give away what happens to Philomena or whether Angwin gets his faith back or the saints are returned to their plinths or who forfeits whose virginity or who spontaneously bursts into flames. This book is a sort of mystery, after all. In Hilary Mantel's world, most things are.</p>
