        <p>DR. DAVID BANK desperately wants to be a celebrity dermatologist. So desperately that for the last three years he has paid a publicist $3,000 a month and given away thousands of dollars in free services to journalists to get his name in magazine articles and to appear on television shows, where he offers medical advice on everything from laser surgery to sunscreen protection.</p>
        <p>The cost of getting his name out has been worth it, he said. The dermatology practice at his clinic in Westchester County has grown, and so also has the caliber of his patient roster. Blythe Danner and Chevy Chase are celebrities he boasts of tending to.</p>
        <p>''I think I'm one of the best doctors out there, and I want to get the word out,'' Dr. Bank, a Columbia medical graduate, said. To do that, he often invites writers and editors of leading women's magazines to visit his clinic in Mount Kisco, N.Y., where he performs laser treatments, chemical peels, botox injections, liposuction and other high-priced procedures free -- with the understanding that they will write about him.</p>
        <p>''It's a good working relationship,'' he said, though sometimes, he said, ''it can bite you.'' About a year ago, he related, he treated an old skiing scar on the knee of Lauren Purcell, who was then an editor at Mademoiselle, using a pulse dye laser to repair the mark, a procedure that normally costs $300 to $800. He said that Ms. Purcell promised to write about her free treatment, but never did.</p>
        <p>''It happens,'' Dr. Bank said. ''It's part of doing business.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Purcell, now the articles editor at Self magazine, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Like hair colorists, fashion designers and chefs, more and more doctors are seeking publicity to build their businesses. Freed of legal constraints that prohibited them from advertising and faced with shrinking incomes in the age of managed care, they are aggressively marketing themselves as experts on beauty and health in magazines like Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Elle, Self and Good Housekeeping and on television shows like ''Today,'' where they reach millions who are willing to pay for elective medical treatments.</p>
        <p>But where does this leave the interests of readers and viewers? Are they receiving accurate, unbiased information about medical procedures that can profoundly affect their health and appearance? Are magazines making household names of the best doctors -- or the ones with the best publicists? Most pointedly, when journalists accept free services from physicians, are they obligating themselves to deliver favorable coverage, in effect serving as shills?</p>
        <p>More than journalistic ethics are at stake. Every time a doctor's name appears in a health or beauty article, a reader is likely to take that as an endorsement and go under the knife.</p>
        <p>''It's frustrating, women make more decisions based on the magazines than their doctor referrals or friends combined,'' said Dr. Debra Jaliman, a Manhattan dermatologist.</p>
        <p>There is little question that accepting free treatment is widespread at women's magazines, where most articles about the booming fields of cosmetic surgery and dermatology appear, and that it leads to mostly positive coverage. Dr. Patricia Wexler, a much-quoted Manhanattan dermatologist who has achieved the celebrity status to which Dr. Bank aspires (patients wait months to see her), said: ''All the time I give free botox, collagen, chemical peels to journalists who will write about it. They quote me as if I were George Washington.''</p>
        <p>Dr. George Beraka, a Manhattan plastic surgeon, who also gets a lot of press, said: ''Absolutely all the time, doctors give writers free services to get them to write about it. Free face-lifts, even that, sure.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Laurie Polis, a dermatologist who directs the SoHo Integrative Health Center, a sleek, Zen-theme clinic, said: ''I feel strong-armed. I don't want to barter services for mentions, but I can't bite the hand that feeds me.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Polis described how a contributing editor for More, a beauty and fashion magazine for older women, recently had a free day of treatments, including ''botox, a facial, a dermabrasion peel,'' and met with the clinic's staff for free consultations. Shortly after, Dr. Polis said, the reporter called and requested full-body laser treatments with a Cool Touch laser, a new machine. ''My jaw was on the floor,'' Dr. Polis said, adding that when she balked, the reporter ''threw a hissy fit.'' ''Some of these people are so entitled,'' she said. ''Laser treatments are expensive, and what she wanted would have taken six treatments.''</p>
        <p>The More writer, Lynn Schnurnberger, said that Dr. Polis had promised her the laser treatments, then reneged. ''I was angry with her because she offered me something and then didn't come through,'' Ms. Schnurnberger said. Her day of beauty, she said, consisted of a ''short, 20-minute dermabrasion peel'' and free consultations; no botox or facial, as Dr. Polis maintains.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's anything wrong with taking free services as long as you say in your article it was free,'' the writer said. She said she is still working on the article and expects it to run next year.</p>
        <p>About receiving free treatments in the course of reporting, mainstream journalistic practice is clear: it is a conflict of interest for reporters and editors to accept products or services of value from those they cover.</p>
        <p>''It's totally unethical, and any journalist at a respectable publication would be fired for it,'' said Judy Foreman, who writes a health column for The Boston Globe. ''Anyone can't help but be influenced by free treatment. Even for a moment, assuming they're not, there's still the appearance of a conflict. The publications should pay for services they want to write about.''</p>
        <p>Even if reporters disclose that a treatment was free, something rarely done, experts in medical ethics are skeptical that the interests of the reader can be well served. ''Of course getting a free service influences'' journalists, said George Annas, the chairman of health law at the Boston University School of Public Health. ''It's just as disingenuous and self-serving for them to say otherwise as it is for doctors to say they aren't influenced by the drug companies who hand out freebies.''</p>
        <p>But most women's magazines operate under different rules from daily newspapers. Just as magazine fashion editors take gifts of $1,000 Prada handbags or 25 percent discounts on Jimmy Choo shoes, maintaining that it is a professional courtesy that does not influence their decision about what to put in their pages, magazine beauty editors and writers receive spa and medical treatments and say the same thing. (The New York Times prohibits journalists from accepting gifts from news sources.)</p>
        <p>Roberta Myers, editor in chief at Elle, said her magazine allows its writers to accept free treatments related to articles they are writing. ''I can see why it looks suspicious, but the proof is in the piece,'' she said. ''We do not feel obligated to write positively about a doctor, whether we paid or not.''</p>
        <p>Cynthia Leive, the editor in chief of Self, said her magazine had no clear-cut policy on writers and editors accepting free treatments. ''We grapple with this issue all the time,'' she said. Later she called back and added, ''Of course this is against journalistic policy.''</p>
        <p>Linda Wells, the editor in chief of Allure, said her magazine pays for any services it writes about. ''My policy is that we always pay,'' Ms. Wells said. ''If someone is violating my policy, I'll have to see it and deal with it.''</p>
        <p>Readers of health and beauty articles in women's magazines know that the same doctors' names appear over and over. These physicians have often achieved their status because they have publicists who send journalists mass mailings and sometimes set up meetings and appointments for free treatment.</p>
        <p>Even if the writers never visit the doctors' offices, they know the physicians will interrupt appointments to return calls and offer sound bites. But health experts say readers form an inaccurate impression about these often-quoted doctors. ''Obviously the average consumer thinks that when he reads Doctor X's name over and over again in the magazines, he's the best,'' said Ross Frazier, a spokesman for the American Medical Association.</p>
        <p>There is a fierce appetite among some cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists to have their names in the press. Ms. Foreman of The Boston Globe said that at a conference last year of the American Society of Plastic Surgery, where she sat on a panel, physicians clamored to know how to get quoted and whether they should hire publicists.</p>
        <p>''They didn't understand the difference between advertising and journalism,'' she said. Ms. Foreman said most of what she writes about is derived from research and scientific studies. She considers it ''a total turnoff'' if a doctor hires a publicist.</p>
        <p>But Nancy Behrman of Behrman Communications in New York, who represents the often-quoted Dr. Helen S. Colen, a Park Avenue plastic surgeon, said, ''It's so competitive out there that doctors feel they have no choice but to hire a publicist to put them in touch with the media.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''It's a fact: women are inclined to go check out doctors they read about over and over again.''</p>
        <p>Since 1982, when the Supreme Court upheld an order by the Federal Trade Commission requiring the American Medical Association to permit doctors to advertise, the association's policy has been neither to  encourage nor to discourage medical advertising, said Dr. Herbert Rakatansky, the chairman of its council on ethical and judicial affairs. Hiring publicists to get exposure for services they offer is tantamount to advertising, he said. Doctors are now subject to false advertising and fraud claims under consumer laws, and their ads must be truthful, he added.</p>
        <p>While most of the procedures that doctors discuss in the press are accepted practice, some treatments have no scientific backing or are too new to have a history.</p>
        <p>''No consumer should ever take the word of a doctor they read in the magazines,'' said Dr. David J. Goldberg, a dermatologist and a former president of the American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery. ''My clinic is one of a handful in the country that does all the major testing for the government, but my name almost never gets quoted. Why? Because I don't spend the money to get my name in the magazines.''</p>
        <p>Joann Moroz, 62, a nurse who lives in Briarcliff, N.Y., said she went to Dr. Bank, the Mount Kisco dermatologist, for laser eye surgery last October after seeing his name in magazines and on television.</p>
        <p>Using an erbium laser, he operated on her to remove crow's feet, but her face never healed properly, she said, and she had ''welts and scars'' around her eyes. When she complained, Dr. Bank injected her with cortisone, prescribed a scar-healing cream and assured her things would be fine, she said.</p>
        <p>But she was not satisfied and in January visited Dr. Roy Geronemus, a Manhattan laser specialist, to seek treatment for the scars.</p>
        <p>About Dr. Bank, Ms. Moroz said: ''It really infuriates me that I see his name everywhere. I went to him because I thought he had to know what he was doing: he's in every magazine in the country, he's on television.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Moroz said she had not complained to Dr. Bank but intended to seek reimbursement of the $2,000 she said she had paid, plus the cost of Dr. Geronemus's work.</p>
        <p>Dr. Geronemus said he would not comment on a patient under his care. Dr. Bank also declined to comment about Ms. Moroz, citing patient confidentiality. But he said: ''With any procedure there's always a small number of patients who have complications. It doesn't necessarily mean that anything was done wrong on the part of the physician.'' Dr. Bank said he had been using the erbium laser to perform eye surgery since 1992, and it's ''a routine procedure'' for him.</p>
        <p>''I would be cautious about implying that there has been any factual investigation here,'' he added. ''To report one person's claim of a suboptimal result and to imply it is in any way the physician's fault is thin at best.''</p>
        <p>Many doctors are disdainful of promoting themselves with publicists. Dr. Vicki Levine, a physician in the dermatology department at the New York University Medical Center, whose specialty is laser surgery, frowns on the practice. ''It makes medicine like haircutting,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mary Duenwald, Harper's Bazaar's executive editor, said, ''I wish the magazines would get together and ban all doctors who use publicists.''</p>
        <p>That seems unlikely. Last year, Dr. Thomas Romo, a Manhattan plastic surgeon, enjoyed a coup when he was featured in long articles in two magazines within months. Both articles chronicled face-lifts Dr. Romo performed at less than his usual fee with the understanding they would be written about.</p>
        <p>Sydney Biddle Barrows, the former Mayflower Madam, received a full lift for an article by James Servin in Harper's Bazaar in February 1999. (She plans to write a book about her experience.) Then, Marie Claire ran an article about a face-lift Dr. Romo performed on a patient he found for the magazine. A financial arrangement ''that's appealing for both the doctor and the patient'' was made, said Susan Yaeger, Dr. Romo's surgical consultant.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wexler, the high-profile dermatologist, does not have a publicist. But in her climb to the top she has always given free treatments to journalists writing about her. ''I did a $2,500 peel on a Ladies' Home Journal editor,'' she said. ''I did collagen in Michael Musto's lips, and he wrote about it in The Voice. I did Candace Bushnell's collagen for a story in Vogue. I did an acne consultation for a piece by Rebecca Johnson at Vogue, and I gave Simon Doonan a free consultation for a column he did in The Observer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Musto said that Dr. Wexler solicited him at The Village Voice in the early 90's through a publicist. ''It was a pioneering thing then,'' he said. ''Collagen was just starting to be widespread. She proposed it to a number of writers, and I was the only one who took her up on it. I spoofed the whole thing, called it the Paris Lip.'' He also made the rare disclosure in print that he received the $400 treatment at no cost.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doonan, who wrote about his consultation in The New York Observer of May 8, referred to Dr. Wexler as ''dermatological royalty'' but did not mention that her $350 fee for an audience was waived.</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson, who received free consultations from Dr. Wexler and two other dermatologists for her November 1996 Vogue article, said that receiving no-cost services ''in no way affects how I write about a doctor.'' She added that Vogue, where she is a contributing editor, generally does not publish negative accounts of treatments because its focus is on ''celebrating this stuff.''</p>
        <p>Amy Astley, Vogue's beauty director, confirmed that writers and editors are often ''comped'' -- given complimentary services -- including more than $5,000 worth of cosmetic dentistry that Julia Reed, a senior writer, received from Dr. Larry Rosenthal in the course of profiling him in the November 1998 Vogue. But Ms. Astley insisted this practice did not affect the objectivity of her contributors.</p>
        <p>''We don't feel any obligation to report on services that may have been comped and we don't think are good, whether it's as simple as a manicure or more elaborate like a dermatological peel,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Vogue doesn't run negative criticism of books or movies or usually even of fashion collections or of beauty products or services or professionals,'' she said. ''Our overall message is very positive and upbeat. For us a negative review is simply to not include it in the magazine.''</p>
        <p>One detail that escaped Ms. Reed's glowing profile of Dr. Rosenthal, her dentist: his license was suspended for six months in 1987, according to the New York State division of professional licensing, which would not disclose the reason. Dr. Rosenthal explained in an article in The New York Times on Jan 31, 1999, that he had been disciplined for misusing prescription forms to obtain sleeping and diet pills, but he said another person had stolen the forms and used them.</p>
        <p>It is rare indeed for a women's magazine article to criticize or even question the treatments proffered free to writers. So rare that Dr. Bank, the Mount Kisco dermatologist, was surprised when an article in the April issue of Mirabella presented a dissenting view of his hyperbaric oxygen treatments.</p>
        <p>In the article, Holly Millea, the writer, described being zipped into a sleeping-bag device and flooded with oxygen for 45 minutes, a procedure that Dr. Bank says slows aging, relieves migraines, fights depression and helps with weight loss. Ms. Millea quoted two other doctors who called the procedure clinically untested and suggested it was, well, snake oil.</p>
        <p>''That's the only time that has happened to me,'' Dr. Bank said, adding that In Style did an article on the same treatment, and ''their writer liked it.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 23, 2000, Sunday  An article on July 2 about doctors who give journalists free beauty and health treatments with the expectation of being featured in articles misstated the types of procedures provided without cost by a dermatologist, Dr. David Bank. He has performed laser treatments and a hyperbaric oxygen treatment on journalists, but not chemical peels, botox injections or liposuction. The article also misstated the frequency with which Dr. Bank performed free treatments. He does not do them often; he has done them intermittently in the last four years.</p>
