        <p>THE shimmering heat of a summer's morning on the short-grass prairie of the Great Plains is unsettling. It's already so hot, and the wind never seems to let up. Stepping out of a truck onto the parched stubble in sandals is downright alarming, for with each footfall a thousand grasshoppers scatter.</p>
        <p>My 13-year-old son, John, and I had driven cross-country last July to Oklahoma, which in the language of the Choctaw means ''red people,'' looking for American Indian powwows because, like many American families, we have an Indian ancestor, a Choctaw. Earlier that morning we had left Guthrie, the territory's first capital, 15 miles north of Oklahoma City; picked up my husband, John, at Will Rogers World Airport; and headed southwest toward the town of Anadarko, tribal headquarters for the Plains Apache, Western Delaware and Wichita. Although this part of the world has been Indian territory for 20,000 years, it wasn't officially designated as such until 1825, when the United States government promised it to the Plains Indians and what were known as the Five Civilized Tribes --  Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, and Seminole -- ''for as long as grass grows and water runs.''</p>
        <p>Their powwows evolved from gatherings of medicine men and spiritual leaders who danced to invoke divine aid or, on the Great Plains, to commemorate the buffalo hunt.  Now the powwows are social events that take place every weekend from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Visitors have been welcome at intertribal powwows since the late 19th century, and because our extended families live at the northern and southern boundaries of Indian territory, we have attended powwows over the years from Kansas City, Mo., to Fort Worth.</p>
        <p>''When you get to Anadarko, take a right at the Baptist Church, pass Wal-Mart, and meet us at the deserted gas station about three miles on your left,'' were the directions given us by Margo Edringer. She and her husband, Edgar, are the German proprietors of a tepee village called Wolf's Heaven who were to guide us to powwows in the area that weekend. Guests at the camp sleep in tepees, eat meals prepared over an open fire by an Indian cook, hike, fish, listen to storytelling and attend local powwows.</p>
        <p>After following Margo Edringer across that grasshopper-laden prairie, we rested under a willow awning. She offered us iced tea and frybread, then led us to the tepees.  ''They're all authentic,'' she said. ''This one is made in the Northern style.'' We stepped over the rawhide threshold onto the packed-dirt floor; two narrow beds flanked a hole in the center, dug to accommodate a small fire. The door had been cut out of the side to create a snow break.</p>
        <p>The heat made snow seem so remote that I found myself calculating instead how hard it would be for a snake to sneak in. ''Oh, snakes are not a problem,'' Ms. Edringer assured us, raising her long skirts as she crossed the narrow path through the grass to the river. Edgar Edringer and the staff -- all Indian -- were fishing from the riverbank, and while we watched, they snagged a snapping turtle. The woods by the river broke the prairie wind, and here it was still.</p>
        <p>That afternoon a dozen of us from Wolf's Heaven were invited to a smoking ceremony out at Nathan Redbone's place. Mr. Redbone is an Apache elder whose wife had just died, and the ceremony was taking place in her honor. The extended family and friends of the Redbones were eating in their yard under a canopy that bowed furiously in the fierce wind at the top of the hill.</p>
        <p>Inside a tepee beside the family's brick house, Mr. Redbone's brother-in-law was ''cedaring'' (blessing) first the children, then the family and Wolf's Heaven people with smoke from a small fire of seeds and fragrant grasses, which he coaxed upward and brushed along each of our faces with a feather fan. I asked Nathan Redbone if the blessings were words best kept quietly in one's heart. ''Once we tell you a story it's not ours anymore,'' he replied. The Apache lifeway -- an American Indian term for lifestyle -- is so endangered that this family shared its most intimate gatherings so that someone, anyone, might remember.</p>
        <p>By evening we were traveling in convoy to a powwow near the town of Apache, 18 miles from Anadarko. A rarely performed fire dance was going on at the Fort Sill Apache Tribal Center. Dancers wearing flat, antlerlike headdresses, their upper bodies painted white with black slashes and their mouths covered with red scarves, danced the story of two men caught in a cave after a great battle. The Mountain Spirit tells the lame man to climb up on the blind man's shoulders and lead him to where they can make a fire, so that together they may be rescued.  One dancer in the group was a boy of 10 or so, learning by following along.</p>
        <p>The next morning -- awakened before dawn by a noisy chorus of birdsong -- we drove about an hour south to Fort Sill, still an active Army post, built in 1869 to pacify raiding tribes of the southern Plains. One by one the Indian bands surrendered at Fort Sill, including Geronimo, the rebel warrior who was confined there until his death in 1909. Geronimo is buried in the Apache prisoner of war cemetery under an unruly rocky mount of a tombstone, which has become a pilgrimage site. When we asked soldiers at the visitors center the way, they spoke volumes by gruffly informing us the road was flooded and inaccessible.</p>
        <p>Just west of Fort Sill is the Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge. Although signs posted along the perimeter of the Army base cautioned drivers about weapons testing overhead, inside the wildlife refuge one could imagine what this part of the world might have looked while the Indians were still pursuing their lifeway. A herd of buffalo grazed on a prairie filled with summer wildflowers bent over double by the wind. A road coils up the rocky Mount Scott, and from it you can see Texas, and almost to Oklahoma City to the northeast.</p>
        <p>The second half of our trip was spent zigzagging across central and eastern Oklahoma the following weekend, This part of the state was settled by the Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw and Seminole after 1825 when some 16,000 of them were marched by force on a Trail of Tears from lands coveted by white settlers east of the Mississippi River. Unlike Plains Indians, these tribes were not nomadic, and they recreated their lifeways in the wooded areas east and southeast of Tulsa. They resisted annexation to Oklahoma Territory, planning instead for a separate Indian state, but were ignored by Congress, which created a unified Oklahoma in 1907.</p>
        <p>We planned to take in the Pawnee Indian Homecoming Powwow in the town of Pawnee on Saturday night and the Quapaw Powwow on the Fourth of July in Miami, in the far northeast corner of the state at the Missouri border, so we had to high-tail it due east on I-40 toward the Arkansas border aiming for the ancient Spiro Mounds, earthen burial chambers built between 850 and 1450 A.D.</p>
        <p>By afternoon we had reached Sequoyah's Cabin, a national historic landmark near the town of Sallisaw. Sequoyah, a Cherokee intrigued by the white people's books, which he called ''talking leaves,'' created a written syllabary for his native language. As a result, the whole Cherokee nation became literate almost overnight. Computers at the site print out each visitor's name in Cherokee. Armed with copies of our names, and a postcard of the Cherokee alphabet, our son spent the rest of the long road trip translating English word sounds into Cherokee.</p>
        <p>By the time we were close to the Spiro Mounds, it was dusk, which gave courage to several foolish turtles that tried to cross the highway in front of us. We were eager to find our bed-and-breakfast before dark. We had reserved Aunt Jan's Cozy Cabin next to the home of its owner, Jan Wood, in the rural woodlands near Spiro. She offers an optional steak dinner in the cabin, and there's a hot tub on the porch. By nightfall the cicadas are in full chorus. This is not a land of silence, but of raucous varmints and wind.</p>
        <p>In the morning, we drove a short way north to the Spiro Mounds. The sophisticated artifacts excavated there are fashioned from copper or adorned with pearls and conch traded from tribes near the Gulf of Mexico. Some are on view at the adjacent interpretive center, but many more are scattered among museums throughout the state and all over the world. Outside, a path loops around 12 mounds that look simply like grassy hills; they are presided over by tiny toads that kept us amused by leaping across the walkway.</p>
        <p>The Cherokee Heritage Center is north of Spiro on a roundabout way to Tulsa, 40 miles back northwest. It includes Tsa La Gi, a re-creation of a 16th-century Cherokee settlement, and a stridently didactic museum, which includes a display of ancient Indian games and gaming gear.</p>
        <p>From there we traveled through Tulsa and down an undulating ribbon of two-lane highway to the Homestead at GT Ranch near the town of Red Rock. This bed-and-breakfast is a log cabin with a view out over the heads of a few longhorn cattle being teased by the ranch's noisy dogs. We'd gone back west just far enough to be in the Plains again, where the land looks like an endless sea and the dirt is red as blood.</p>
        <p>When we went inside to drop off our bags the only thing in the vast sky was the orange sun. When we got back in the truck on our way to the Pawnee Powwow, the sun had slipped so quickly beyond the horizon that we could almost feel the earth turning. It was dark by the time we arrived in Pawnee.  A brightly colored circle of woven plastic lawn chairs formed a wide ring on the field around the sacred drum. Nine or 10 men sat at the drum, striking it and singing. Once the powwow began, the drum was as incessant as a heartbeat.</p>
        <p>This intertribal powwow honors Indian veterans. Before reservation life, the Indian warrior's role was paramount to the survival of his people, so Indian veterans of any war are highly revered. The Grand Entry at all powwows is led by soldiers bearing the Eagle Staff, representing the American Indian ''first nation.'' Some who fought in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf danced in fatigues, squatting low and imitating the movements of a prairie chicken. The evening progressed through different categories: junior men's grass dance, traditional and fancy dances, followed by ladies' fancy shawl, jingle and buckskin dances.  Men's traditional dance steps mimic birds or warriors in search of an enemy. Women's are more subtle, a step and a bend of the knee or a gentle rocking. Fringe on a buckskin skirt sways like grass in the breeze; an outstretched shawl  becomes a butterfly. It is part of the contest to make headdress feathers and fringe come to a complete stop on the downstroke of a song's last drumbeat.</p>
        <p>Big powwows include raffles of Indian blankets and jewelry, prize money for dance contest winners, and a contingent of booths selling crafts, tribal T-shirts and ''Free Leonard Peltier'' pins and bumper stickers. Mr. Peltier, a leader of the Ojibwa-Sioux, has spent two decades in prison after being convicted, some believe wrongfully, of killing two F.B.I. agents in 1975. Alcohol is strictly forbidden but stands sell Indian tacos and frybread.</p>
        <p>Protocol dictated that as tourists we ask permission before setting up folding chairs behind families of those dancing. It took a little courage to plunge into the all-Indian crowd, but we were welcomed with a genial indifference. At one point, the whole powwow came to a standstill when an eagle feather fell to the ground during a dance. Four men attacked four times from the four directions to retrieve it and restore its lost power.</p>
        <p>Our last day in Oklahoma was the Fourth of July. The Quapaw Powwow we attended that night is held at a campground outside Miami, Okla., in a sunken arena with concrete bench rows built into the hill that made it look like a little Roman amphitheater. Miss Indian USA, a former Quapaw tribal princess, danced near the head of the line during the Grand Entry and led the blanket dance, during which a blanket is laid out for donations to the drum. It is customary to place money on the blanket for the singers' traveling expenses, then to dance the rest of the song. We felt awkward joining in, so we asked a child already in the circle to throw our money in. We stayed late enough to see the men's fancy dance, notable for its elaborate regalia (it is never called a costume), including two huge feather bustles and matching headdress.</p>
        <p>At a booth selling Indian jewelry, our son John laid claim to a ceremonial club made in the traditional style by a man of Choctaw descent.  He came back from the concession stand with a Quapaw friend with whom he forged a brief bond as one does when meeting a second cousin once removed. The Quapaw Powwow, like any big family reunion, seemed a remarkably apt way to spend an American holiday.</p>
