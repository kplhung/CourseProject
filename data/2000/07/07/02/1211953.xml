        <p>Terry Forrestal, a British stuntman who staged and performed action sequences for such Hollywood blockbusters as ''Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,'' ''Braveheart'' and ''Titanic,'' died on June 10 in a jumping accident in Norway. He was 52 and lived in Berkshire, England.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forrestal died while attempting what is known as a base jump from the 3,000-foot Kjerag cliff in Lysefjord, Norway, The Times of London reported. In base-jumping -- an acronym derived from Bridge, Antennae, Span, Earth -- jumpers leap from a fixed point, like the top of a building, bridge or mountain, for a relatively short drop, using a special parachute.</p>
        <p>After completing seven successful jumps in Norway on an expedition that was his own but was being documented by a television crew, Mr. Forrestal jumped from Kjerag and landed awkwardly on a ridge, possibly breaking his legs. Eleven hours later, while waiting to be rescued, he apparently attempted a second jump from the ridge using his reserve parachute, which failed to open.</p>
        <p>One of the leading stuntmen in the film industry since entering the field in the mid-1980's, Mr. Forrestal jumped, dived, crashed and fought his way through some of the major action films of the last 15 years, from the James Bond episodes -- ''A View to a Kill,'' ''Moonraker'' and ''Octopussy'' -- to ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' and ''Titanic,'' in which he played the ship's doomed chief engineer.</p>
        <p>In 1992, he was pulled from the River Clyde during the filming of the a television show, when a motorcycle stunt went awry.</p>
        <p>Terrence Philip Julian Forrestal was born in Chesterfield and studied medicine for a year before joining the army, serving as a senior noncommissioned officer in Ireland.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1980's, he began to work for films, specializing in depicting urban guerrilla and jungle warfare. His last job was ''Rebel Heart,'' the BBC program about the 1916 uprising in Ireland.</p>
