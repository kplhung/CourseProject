        <p>The quick deployment of United Nations peacekeepers and Lebanese forces into the stretch of southern Lebanon that Israel abandoned in May after 22 years of occupation has been thrown into doubt with the controversy over a series of apparent Israeli incursions across a border line drawn in 1923.</p>
        <p>When the United Nations Security Council voted two weeks ago to endorse Secretary General Kofi Annan's certification that Israel had indeed pulled out its troops, opening the way for an additional force of peacekeepers to fill the security vacuum along the border, Lebanon protested the findings. But Mr. Annan brushed aside Lebanese objections, saying there were only a couple of border violations by Israel and they would be cleared up swiftly.</p>
        <p>But then there were more transgressions, and United Nations relations with both Lebanon and Israel became strained. Newspapers in the region have reported an angry exchange, including curses, between Mr. Annan and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, as well as as a lengthy, middle-of-the-night telephone call in which Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright reportedly shouted at President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon to send his army into the south to replace the Hezbollah guerrillas who are now the only force of local order.</p>
        <p>The United Nations has sent officers from the peacekeeping force that has patrolled the south for more than 20 years to survey and map the border, with orders to report back to New York headquarters daily.</p>
        <p>This week, the surveyors found nine violations by Israel, United Nations officials said at their headquarters in Naqura.</p>
        <p>Most of the violations, they said, were minor. One, for instance, involved a lone Israeli soldier at an observation post on a hill a few dozen yards over the nominal line, although the next day he was joined by two armored personnel carriers.</p>
        <p>But the violations have become a political issue, and have drawn a threat from the leader of the Hezbollah militia to take unspecified action if the United Nations does not resolve the dispute.</p>
        <p>Here along a lonely stretch of road through the stony hills where the border marches sharply north to swing around the Israeli settlement of Metulla are several problems that have evolved during the two decades Israel maintained what it called a ''security zone'' in southern Lebanon with the help of Lebanese militias.</p>
        <p>Border Post 33 -- a cement stake marking a point along the line -- is atop Sheik Abad Hill, a little way south. It had been a South Lebanon Army and Israeli gun position. B.P. 34 is in a creek bed below a cliff where a Lebanese family serves thick coffee in a makeshift cafe of a truck and awning. B.P. 35 is on another hill running north.</p>
        <p>Across the creek bed is the Israeli hilltop settlement of Misgavan. Over the course of the occupation, the Israelis moved their security fences forward, and the settlement spread over the old border. Thus, if the original border were followed, the settlement would be cut in half.</p>
        <p>To the north in Addaiseh, the border line drawn in 1923 -- which runs down a hill and then turns alongside the main road -- would, if strictly followed, put about 10 Lebanese houses in Israel. Just to the south, the border runs so close to a road alongside the Israeli settlement of Manara that it would be impossible to build a security fence.</p>
        <p>Like many of the problems of the modern Middle East, this one dates back to the way the Western powers divided up the defeated Ottoman Empire after World War I. Two lieutenant colonels, one French, one British, trudged up and down the hills from the coast to below Mount Hermon, marking what was to be the border of Syria and Palestine with piles of whitewashed rocks. Over the years, it shifted here and there.</p>
        <p>''This is a border on wheels,'' a United Nations official said.</p>
        <p>But the Lebanese government, which takes its cues from Syria, has declared every inch sacred. Israel, for its part, wants to retain high ground, which in much of the area provides a commanding position overlooking its north.</p>
        <p>Beirut newspapers quoted President Lahoud as saying that Mr. Annan had promised him by telephone on Tuesday that the Israeli encroachments would be cleared up.  ''Annan promised me to end the violations in three days and to send radar systems and helicopters to monitor any future Israeli violations,'' Mr. Lahoud was quoted as saying.</p>

        <p>Military Sentences 30</p>
        <p>BEIRUT, Lebanon, July 1 (Agence France-Presse) -- Amid rising concern over the conduct of the trials, a military court today sentenced 30 Lebanese convicted of collaborating with Israel to prison terms ranging up to 120 years.</p>
        <p>The 120-year term was handed to Emile Yussef Nasr, who led a brigade of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army. The court sentenced 42 others Friday night, to terms ranging from several months to 15 years. The court has sentenced 605 people since it began work June 5 and intends to try about 2,200 Lebanese.</p>
        <p>Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, has called the trials ''a parody of justice'' that ''can in no way help national reconciliation.''</p>
