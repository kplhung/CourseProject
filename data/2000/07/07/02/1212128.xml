        <p>THE history of cinema parallels the history of recorded music in that both have been concerned, since the necessary technical discoveries were made at the end of the 19th century, with composing in time: composing images, and later sounds, in film; composing sounds alone where music is concerned. With a grand inevitability, therefore, Jean-Luc Godard's four-and-a-half-hour video ''Histoire(s) du Cinema'' presents itself also as, one might say, ''Histoire(s) de la Musique,'' and it is fitting that the soundtrack alone should be available. It comes from ECM (whose moving spirit, Manfred Eicher, has long been a friend and collaborator of the distinguished director) in the form of a smartly packaged set, purchasable online through Barnes &amp; Noble (www.bn.com, $180). Five CD's are accompanied by four hardcover volumes presenting Mr. Godard's text, in English and German as well as the original French, with stills from the video.</p>
        <p>So persuasive is ''Histoire(s) du Cinema'' as a purely auditory, musical phenomenon that these pictures prove curiously redundant, though sometimes striking in themselves. Certainly, one does not feel that anything is missing, for there is so much that is not. The recording presents Mr. Godard's poetic narration -- nearly always delivered in his own richly inflected voice, bronchial yet robust, a musical instrument itself -- interspersed and overlapping with snatches from movie soundtracks and musical recordings. Sometimes there is, too, the sound of a manual typewriter: a nicely old-fashioned touch, and useful in enhancing the effect of a present time in which Mr. Godard is composing his text, while all around him, on monitors and CD players in his studio, the history of 20th-century culture is playing over. (The textual repetitions, too, make it seem that one is hearing the conceiving rather than the achieved conception.)</p>

        <p>So persuasive is ''Histoire(s) du Cinema'' as a purely auditory, musical phenomenon that these pictures prove curiously redundant, though sometimes striking in themselves. Certainly, one does not feel that anything is missing, for there is so much that is not. The recording presents Mr. Godard's poetic narration -- nearly always delivered in his own richly inflected voice, bronchial yet robust, a musical instrument itself -- interspersed and overlapping with snatches from movie soundtracks and musical recordings. Sometimes there is, too, the sound of a manual typewriter: a nicely old-fashioned touch, and useful in enhancing the effect of a present time in which Mr. Godard is composing his text, while all around him, on monitors and CD players in his studio, the history of 20th-century culture is playing over. (The textual repetitions, too, make it seem that one is hearing the conceiving rather than the achieved conception.)</p>
        <p>Yet heard another way, the movies and the music come from an eternal present, the land of Oz, while Mr. Godard's is the fragile voice of the temporary. The voices of the Hollywood actors of the 1930's and 40's are forever young -- even Alfred Hitchcock, heard in an interview, is not getting any older -- and the wordless voices heard in Liszt's ''Faust Symphony'' or Schubert's ''Unfinished'' will never age. Mr. Godard's voice, though, comes from a particular moment: a moment when joy at the ending of an old era in Europe, that of the cold war, had swiftly been replaced by anxieties as to what sort of age was coming next.</p>
        <p>Distrust, in fact, rustles all through Mr. Godard's history or histories, made over a 10-year period beginning in 1988. Speaking of the birth of film, he tells how ''in the early morning of the 20th century, technologies decided to reproduce life . . . but as morality was still strong . . . they wore mourning for this putting to death, and it was in the colors of mourning, in black and white, that the cinema came into existence.'' Nor does he become any more sanguine about the later development of the genre to which he has devoted his life, and in which, here, he is so much absorbed. There are, he says at one point, only 10 films that make the grade. And most of those would probably be French.</p>
        <p>Further on, in the last two of the four chapters into which ''Histoire(s) du Cinema'' is divided, Mr. Godard's pessimism seeps out far beyond the bounds of the movie theater. ''Nations have something over them that is beneath them,'' he says: governments. He goes on to accuse governments of responsibility for letting loose hatred in Europe, though his malaise is not just political but, at root, philosophical. Yet at the end comes a straw of hope: ''If a man wandered through paradise in his dreams, and kept a flower to remind him where he'd been, and on waking found that flower in his hands -- so what can I say? I was that man.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Godard's despair is moderated by the care and urgency with which he speaks: the sense in everything he says that cinema matters, but people matter more, and cinema matters at all only in that it creates moments that, because of how much and how intensely they mean, one has to call real.</p>
        <p>Talking of Hitchcock in the spaced-out fourth chapter, where the froth of film and music clips has largely subsided, Mr. Godard says ''we've forgotten why Joan Fontaine leans over the edge of the cliff and what it was that Joel McCrea was going to do in Holland,'' and so on, ''but we remember a handbag, but we remember a bus in the desert, but we remember a glass of milk.''</p>
        <p>WHAT makes ''Histoire(s) du Cinema'' special, though, is not so much the substance of Mr. Godard's eulogy-diatribe, nor even its poetic fireworks, but rather the beautifully produced and edited flux of words and music. Right at the start, an enigmatic utterance by Mr. Godard -- ''Change nothing, so that all can be different'' -- makes perfect sense as a verbal equivalent to a quotation from a Hindemith piano piece in which a simple phrase is varied and extended but always comes back to the same emphasized note. Later, but still within the first chapter, ''Le Sacre du Printemps'' is tellingly intercut with Looney Tunes music, and the heroic ring of a movie actor is matched by that of a Puccini tenor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Godard and Mr. Eicher provide only the skimpiest indication of the music included and no key to the films, presumably because they want ''Histoire(s) du Cinema'' to be heard not as a compendium but as itself, a composition in sound, where speaking voice folds into orchestra, movie into music, creating an aural river one can enjoy as it comes and remember, like those Hitchcock films, for its instants of illumination.</p>
