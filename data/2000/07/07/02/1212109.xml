        <p>HATS off, gentlemen, to American Ballet Theater for a heroic season. The repertory looked better on stage than on paper and a clever Band-Aid approach kept performances at a high standard despite an inordinate amount of illness and injury among the dancers.</p>
        <p>It was the season of the unexpected. Damian Woetzel from New York City Ballet and William Marrie from the National Ballet of Canada parachuted in for single performances to relieve the company's overworked male principals. Much of the burden had to do with the technique required in the full-evening works that dominate Ballet Theater's seasons at the Metropolitan Opera House.</p>

        <p>HATS off, gentlemen, to American Ballet Theater for a heroic season. The repertory looked better on stage than on paper and a clever Band-Aid approach kept performances at a high standard despite an inordinate amount of illness and injury among the dancers.</p>
        <p>It was the season of the unexpected. Damian Woetzel from New York City Ballet and William Marrie from the National Ballet of Canada parachuted in for single performances to relieve the company's overworked male principals. Much of the burden had to do with the technique required in the full-evening works that dominate Ballet Theater's seasons at the Metropolitan Opera House.</p>
        <p>The happiest surprise in this category was John Cranko's 1969 ''Taming of the Shrew,'' a comic ballet low on choreographic interest but powerfully put across by Ballet Theater's casts in a company premiere. The major new production was by Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater's artistic director: a ''Swan Lake'' successfully staged along more or less traditional lines.</p>
        <p>The only original work came from Twyla Tharp. Her one-act ''Variations on a Theme by Haydn,'' later retitled ''The Brahms-Haydn Variations,'' needed three performances for its rich intricacies to build to a grand climax. The premiere was part of the opening gala celebrating the company's 60th anniversary -- which was quickly forgotten.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this was because the good old days do not speak to the new audience Ballet Theater has had to attract with full-evening spectacles to fill the Met. But thanks to this season's revival of Antony Tudor's ''Jardin aux Lilas,'' and to ''Theme and Variations,'' created for Ballet Theater in 1947 by George Balanchine, Mr. McKenzie maintained a link with the great 20th-century choreographers associated with the troupe. The return of Erik Bruhn's 1964 staging of ''La Sylphide,'' in August Bournonville's 19th-century Danish version, was another reminder of a more eclectic past.</p>
        <p>What has gone more or less unnoticed is that each season at the Met is increasingly devoted to full-evening works influenced by Soviet ballet's aesthetics. This is neither good nor bad but a fact, evident even in the British ballets of Kenneth MacMillan and Cranko.</p>
        <p>Ballet Theater's production of MacMillan's 1965 ''Romeo and Juliet'' derives directly from Leonid Lavrovsky's 1940 Soviet ballet to the Prokofiev score. Cranko's duets in ''The Taming of the Shrew'' owe much to the highly physical partnering, including overhead lifts and tosses, that Soviet ballet made famous.</p>
        <p>Among the company's 19th-century Russian classics originally choreographed by Marius Petipa (in part or entirely), ''Swan Lake'' has some antecedents in pre-Soviet versions that Nicholas Sergeyev, a Petipa regisseur, staged in Britain. But ''La Bayadere,''  ''Le Corsaire'' and ''Don Quixote'' have come down from Soviet productions. The bravura solos that Vakhtang Chabukiani of the Kirov Ballet added to ''Bayadere'' and ''Corsaire'' would have been technically impossible in the 19th century.</p>
        <p>It is this virtuosity that has brought so much attention to the brilliant male dancers Mr. McKenzie has recruited. But 19th-century ballets are built around ballerinas, and they offered a showcase for Irina Dvorovenko, who had a breakthrough season, usually in tandem with her husband, Maxim Belotserkovsky.</p>
        <p>Once with the Kiev Ballet in Ukraine, both have refashioned themselves into new kinds of dancers. He has added virtuosity to his pure classical style. She has added refinement to her virtuosity.</p>
        <p>Along the way, the injured or ill included Ethan Stiefel and Giuseppe Picone (both absent all season), Susan Jaffe, Jose Manuel Carreno, Ashley Tuttle and Mr. Belotserkovsky. Julio Bocca, Angel Corella, Vladimir Malakhov and Joaquin De Luz had extra duty while corps members like Marcelo Gomes, Herman Cornejo and Carlos Molina (an admirable Petruchio to Ms. Jaffe's Katherina in ''Shrew'') distinguished themselves in major roles.</p>
        <p>The question is where Ballet Theater will find new full-evening works. MacMillan's ''Romeo'' needs a rest. Ballets like ''Shrew'' are only as good as their performance. The company's ''Don Quixote'' looks pale compared to the version the Bolshoi Ballet has just performed in the United States. The solutions are elsewhere. The audience, looking for tricks and turns, may have been less enthusiastic about ''La Sylphide'' and ''Jardin aux Lilas.'' Yet the first is the epitome of Romantic ballet and the other is a neo-Romantic masterpiece with a Proustian perfume. Both are exquisite works: one should not lose them. Like carrots, they are good for you.</p>
