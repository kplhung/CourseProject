        <p>WASHINGTON STREET in South Norwalk has never been more with it. Just step into Match Wood Burning Oven and Bar on any evening, especially on weekends, and enjoy the scene. (And in warm weather, there's no need to step in at all, as the entire front is wide open to the street.)</p>
        <p>The restaurant's name says it all, with not just one bar but two as well as an open-to-view pizza oven. The short menu features a clutch of appetizers, along with four non-pizza entrees and a few salads, in addition to 10 intriguing pizza selections.</p>

        <p>WASHINGTON STREET in South Norwalk has never been more with it. Just step into Match Wood Burning Oven and Bar on any evening, especially on weekends, and enjoy the scene. (And in warm weather, there's no need to step in at all, as the entire front is wide open to the street.)</p>
        <p>The restaurant's name says it all, with not just one bar but two as well as an open-to-view pizza oven. The short menu features a clutch of appetizers, along with four non-pizza entrees and a few salads, in addition to 10 intriguing pizza selections.</p>
        <p>While it is obvious that Match is a casual place, casual doesn't translate into careless. What surprised us on our first visit was how much care was taken in plate presentation and in creating a menu with combinations far more creative than just another pizzeria.</p>
        <p>This was evident with the arrival of a basket of coarse, hearty focaccia, along with olive oil for dipping. Amplify this by several seductive starters such as beef carpaccio, super skinny slices of excellent beef, served with a basket of baked Parmesan cheese filled with ribbons of fennel salad, and ceviche of scallops and shrimp in a tangy citrus juice marinade.</p>
        <p>An exceptional mascarpone polenta was one of a handful of recited specials: crisp, browned polenta cakes stacked between layers of firm, meaty, baked portobello mushrooms. Bordering the plate were cherry tomatoes alternating with smidgens of pungent parsley pesto.</p>
        <p>Wrapping up our appetizer adventures were roasted jumbo sea scallops swathed in crisp bacon slices, keeping company with sauteed spinach in a rich toasted almond-accented meuniere sauce.</p>
        <p>As pleasing as most starters were, there were two duffers. Baby calamari salad with a red pepper confit had tender but bland squid rings and sweet-tasting peppers sans the confit.</p>
        <p>Our second ho-hum choice was bizarre: a special called watermelon and goat cheese mousse with beet salad. Ordering dishes that sound awful rather than awesome is part of our job description, so we plunged right in.</p>
        <p>The watermelon part of the dish was a large chunk resting vertically on end. It sat beside a huge hillock of goat cheese mousse, which was heavy and dense. (It would have been effective as a creamy spread with crackers, but as a mousse, no way.) Encircling both were cooked beet spears, arranged in a garland of Lincoln Log-like stacks.</p>
        <p>Pizzas are Match's raison d'etre and one in particular was an easy hit. Artichoke heart with spicy sausage, black olives, mozzarella, tomato sauce, a splash of Tabasco and lots of basil was a terrific, oven-sizzled choice with a flavorful thin crust.</p>
        <p>On another evening, however, a sausage pizza had a skimpy array of jalapeno and roasted red peppers, mozzarella, tomato sauce, mere crumbles of spicy Italian sausage and a nearly burned crust with no flavor. Consistency, thy name should be pizza.</p>
        <p>As for the other entrees: Black Angus New York strip steak au poivre was tender and very peppery, as expected, with a counterpoint of broccoli rape and roasted garlic mashed potatoes (tasty despite the lumps), while wood oven-roasted free-range chicken was hot, crispy-skinned, moist and flavorful. Its potato au gratin and green beans (not the menu-stated haricots verts) added appeal.</p>
        <p>Certain desserts are a Match strong suit, especially smooth-textured Key lime cheesecake with graham cracker crust, sharp-tanged apple tart with a border of tinglingly tart mango-raspberry coulis and, best of all, warm chocolate cake with a sublime runny center and decorative border of caramel-cum-chocolate coulis.</p>
        <p>A three-course dinner for two (starters, pizzas and desserts) came to $59 before tax, tip or drinks. The mostly California wine list is basic, priced from $22.</p>
