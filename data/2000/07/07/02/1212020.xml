        <p>Zimbabwe awoke to a new political dynamic after voters gave a nascent opposition party just over a third of the seats in Parliament. The two days of balloting were largely free of the intimidation that has marked the political climate for months. The ruling party, led by longtime President Robert Mugabe, still won the most seats. His party once held all but 3 of the 150 seats. With 57 going to the nine-month-old Movement for Democratic Change, it was a stunning setback for Mr. Mugabe.</p>
