        <p>Re ''For Gays, a Party in Search of a Purpose'' (news article, June 25):</p>
        <p>Thirty-nine states, including New York, permit employment, housing and credit discrimination against gay people. Only Vermont grants gay couples something similar to marriage, yet in the last five years, the federal government and 32 states have passed laws banning the recognition of same-sex marriages. We cannot serve openly in the military or get estate tax benefits no matter how long we live together.</p>

        <p>Eighteen states still criminalize consensual gay sex. Anti-gay initiatives will be on the November ballot in four states and at least five municipalities. I could go on and on.</p>
        <p>Sympathetic portrayals of gay people on television, being recognized as a market by companies and having a lot of elected officials coming to our events should not be confused with actually winning equal rights.</p>

        <p>The writer is executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda.</p>
