        <p>From above, the state of North Dakota is a quilt of wheat and prairie grass stitched by rows of cottonwood, ash and elm trees, two-lane roads, many dirt, and railroad tracks.

        <p>From above, the state of North Dakota is a quilt of wheat and prairie grass stitched by rows of cottonwood, ash and elm trees, two-lane roads, many dirt, and railroad tracks. Every seven or eight miles beyond the few big cities, the tracks link 100-foot-tall, century-old clapboard or galvanized metal grain elevators. Alongside the elevators are towns, laid out in five or 10-block grids, and beyond, farms and ranches.</p>
        <p>But little moves down there. In every second or third town along these tracks, the school, the city hall, the elevator, the bank, the American Legion Hall, the farm tool dealer, the general store of the 30's and the convenience store of the 80's, birds are the only tenants. In many of these communities, only a bar and a church hang on, along with a few homeowners who are too old, too poor or too proud to move, or, who simply prefer the solitude.</p>
        <p>Like towns of the West that turned to shells once they were stripped of their gold, new ghost towns are sprouting over much of the Great Plains.</p>
        <p>In North Dakota and well beyond, across thousands of old rural towns in the broad belly of the Plains from Eastern Montana and Western Minnesota and the Canadian border down through Nebraska into Kansas and Oklahoma, the nation's long run of growth and prosperity has blown right by.</p>
        <p>The contraction is most pronounced in North Dakota, one of only three states, with Connecticut and Rhode Island, to lose population in the 90's. In Ardoch, N.D., population 49, the city hall is padlocked, its windows boarded, its electricity meter still, its clapboard facade unpainted for decades. The bar closed a year or two ago.</p>
        <p>Headstones in the cemetery commemorate Yankee settlers until the early 1900's, when the harsh climate chased the survivors west. Newer headstones mark the deaths of Polish settlers and their heirs until the 1990's. The Poles, too, have moved on. Ardoch's only new inhabitants are sugar beet workers from Mexico.</p>
        <p>In Pisek, a largely Czech town with 113 people, 17 fewer than in 1990, the bank is no bigger than a one-car garage. A notice on the door, posted a year ago, announces new hours. It is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday, 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. The Jelinek family's general store survives, though it loses money and has stopped selling clothing and shoes. ''Just your older people reside in these small towns,'' said Elaine Swartz, the assistant postmaster.</p>
        <p>All that remains for Warsaw's 40 or 50 citizens, descendants of Polish immigrants, is the one bar, Tork's  Polski Dom, and at the corner of two county roads, the surreal 100-year-old St. Stanislaus Roman Catholic Church, an opulent red-brick, gothic edifice with a 143-foot spire, a gilded cross on top. Visible for miles, it rises from the prairie like a cathedral, taller than any tree or grain elevator.</p>
        <p>The church can seat 700, and once it did. ''We're holding our own at 345 parishioners,'' said the pastor, the Rev. Damian Hils, but only because he draws them from as far as Fargo, 110 miles to the south. He worries about more losses. ''Almost all my parishioners are farmers,'' he said, ''and some have had to sell out.''</p>
        <p>It is true that many western Plains communities, in Colorado, Nevada and Utah, are bustling with the fervor of Silicon Valley. Towns outside growing cities are reawakening as they join the transition to the next ring of suburbs. Still other once-sinking towns along major highways, like Interstate 80 that slices east and west through Nebraska, have revived with convenience stores, gas stations, motels and restaurants.</p>
        <p>But the population of the core Plains states of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and the Dakotas, grew at half the 9.6 percent increase of the nation as a whole in the 1990's. Growth of most cities far exceeded state averages while the rural population shrank.</p>
        <p>Funerals in many of these towns outnumber baptisms two to one. Accelerating a process that started decades ago with the mechanization of farming and the depletion of oil fields and mines, the livelier economy elsewhere has shunned investment in the towns and drained off the young to jobs and opportunity in Omaha, Fargo and Pierre and beyond, to Denver and Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>''There is a sorting out going on,'' said Alan Barkema, economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City, Mo., and at the bank's Center for the Study of Rural America. ''Across a vast sweep of the heartland, rural communities are not keeping up. The sad truth of the matter is that some are not going to survive.''</p>
        <p>In hardest hit North Dakota, which lost 5,000 people in the 90's, to 634,000, visits to a score of communities in the northeastern corner yield stubborn survivors and inspired boosters. For $1 each and two years free of local taxes, the city of Minto (population 560 in 1990 and 519 in 1998) is selling 90-by-150-foot housing lots that a developer abandoned provided buyers put homes on them within a year. Six of about 40 lots are left.</p>
        <p>But throughout the four-county area, only the city of Grafton grew, about 5 percent to 5,117, from 1990 to 1998. In North Dakota, said Curtis  Stofferahn, a rural sociologist at the University of North Dakota in Grand  Forks, ''There's a real concern that we're probably seeing the last generation on the land.''</p>
        <p>In Nelson County, one of four counties in the northeastern area and 45 miles west of Grand Forks, the population shrank 17 percent in the 90's, and more would be gone were it not for federal largess. Last year, the North Dakota State Data Center at North Dakota State University in Fargo reports, the government dispensed $11,858 per capita in Nelson County, $6,246 above the national average, for defense, farm, flood, retirement and other programs.</p>
        <p>One worn-out Nelson County town is Whitman, population 89 in 1998 and 63 in 1990. Whitman looks crisp and orderly, with the 10 or 15 homes of  Norwegian descendants with small  gardens and weed-free lawns. But unpaved Main Street is dead. Silent at one end stands the old gray elevator. On one side of the street is an open lot, long cleared of its stores. On the other is an abandoned one-truck firehouse and a shut-down strip of three weathered, one-story shops.</p>
        <p>Just up from Main Street, a high-spirited yellow dog, the only creature in view one afternoon, guards a one-story brick structure, the Whitman Community Center. A window has been broken, and inside, ceiling tiles rot in puddles on a linoleum floor. Across a dirt path from the center is Sarnia United Lutheran Church, immaculate and white.</p>
        <p>Leland Skjervem, 75, a retired farmer whose Norwegian immigrant grandfather settled in Whitman in the 1880's, said the community center shut down about four years ago, the elevator eight years ago, the school 10 years ago and long before that four bars and two general stores. He cannot buy anything close by any more. ''Everything gets to be farther away all the time,'' Mr. Skjervem said. ''The need isn't there for these towns.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Skjervem (pronounced SHER-vem) can still go to the church. A sign out front says that Pastor Sue Mackey performs a service there three of four Sundays a month. From 1992 through last year, its annual report shows, the church buried 11 members and christened four. Twelve people attend services now, he said, compared with 35 eight years ago.</p>
        <p>The towns' demise matters, their advocates say. With safe streets, dawn-to-dusk work, and large and stable, church-going families, they became a model of the American self-image.</p>
        <p>''They are who we are,'' said Bonnie Turner, director of a Lutheran organization in Grand Forks that counsels the rural poor and distributes food boxes. ''And they're blowing to dust.''</p>
        <p>Even now, says Father Hils in Warsaw, ''the kids have a wholesomeness about them, a goodness. They invite us to the prom. You know they wouldn't do that if they were up to anything bad.''</p>
        <p>They are healthy places, too. In predominantly rural North Dakota, the Department of Health and Human Services reports, 63 percent of people 85 and older can still get around and take care of themselves, the highest level in the nation. North Dakotans also have a lower incidence of the nine leading causes of death than the national averages, with one exception -- suicide.</p>
        <p>What growth there has been in  North Dakota has been almost entirely confined to Fargo and Bismarck. All but six of the state's 53 counties lost population in the 1990's, Census Bureau and state estimates show, and five counties lost more than a fifth of their people.</p>
        <p>The decline feeds on itself, said Richard Rathge, director of the state data center. ''It reduces your potential for renewal,'' he said. Faster cars let people bypass Main Street to shop at far-off discount stores. Better roads and buses let counties close schools and whisk children out of town to consolidated schools farther and farther away.</p>
        <p>The state's widely scattered population, with fewer than five people per square mile in 26 counties, makes it all the harder to rally local economies the usual way, by courting employers with assurances of work forces.</p>
        <p>Here and there, communities have invested in telecommunications to help new businesses exploit the Internet. But the tide of decline is overpowering. ''Most people recognize what is going on,'' Mr. Rathge said. ''The frustration is how you deal with it.''</p>
        <p>Well to the north of Nelson County, against the borders of Minnesota and Canada, is Pembina County and this village of Mountain, where the population has slipped from 134 a decade ago to about 120, including 40 residents of the town's only new institution, a home for the elderly. Mountain is and remains entirely Icelandic, the largest Icelandic settlement outside Iceland. Headstones outside the still-vibrant Vikur Lutheran Church bear names inscribed in Icelandic.</p>
        <p>After Gene Gudmundson, 50, finished Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., he resurrected his father's and homesteader grandfather's farm in Mountain, bought more land and raised wheat, barley, pinto beans and sunflowers on 990 acres. He and his wife, Helen, 42, a contract administrator at the Cavalier Air Force Station, built a home in 1978, expanded it six years ago and have four daughters.</p>
        <p>But buffeted by debt, the lowest wheat prices in 30 years and seven years of ruinous drought and floods, the Gudmundsons are considering leaving Mountain for new jobs once their two younger daughters, now teenagers, finish high school.</p>
        <p>In the dreary, daylong drizzle of a few days ago, they auctioned off their farm gear -- plows, swathers, cultivators, combines, planters, herbicide tanks, loaders, five tractors and six trucks. ''You get tired,'' Mrs. Gudmundson said. ''It's not worth it.''</p>
        <p>Among the Gudmundsons' neighbors, Leslie and Delores Geir own 1,000 acres where Mr. Geir's great-grandfather began with the 160 he was given under the Homestead Act. They have two girls, Diane, 16, and Laura, 10, and a son, Chris, 15. To make ends meet, Mrs. Geir is an aide in the home for the elderly, and Diane works there part time.</p>
        <p>All the Geirs still have hope. Chris intends to be a farmer, and Diane hopes to settle on a farm. ''There is no better place to raise a family,'' said Mr. Geir, 47. ''When my kids were little,'' Mrs. Geir said, ''I could let them play alone outside. The dog would stay with them. I would call the dog to find out where they were.''</p>
        <p>But the inertia of decline has begun to intrude. Mr. Geir went to school in Mountain, and there were 10 children in his class. As the population fell, the school was closed and students were sent by bus to school in Edinburg, 16 miles to the south. With further decline, that school, too might go. ''Laura had seven kids in her fourth-grade class,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Mountain, the forces of decline have chased away the optimistic spirit of America. ''The future is pretty dim right now,'' said the mayor of Mountain, S. Douglas Hanson, a gravel truck driver.</p>
        <p>Marabeth Hunter, the postmaster, said: ''We don't have anything now. Just the one bar, the cafe that's open half days, the old folks home and the church. I wish we had stores here, at least one. You have to run 16 miles to get milk.''</p>
