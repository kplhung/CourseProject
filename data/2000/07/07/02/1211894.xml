        <p>V L Higgins letter requests further information on June 18 article about weeping willow growing in Bellamy-Ferriday estate garden in Bethlehem, Conn; editor's note; photo (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I would appreciate further details about the following statement from the article entitled ''A 1920's Estate Garden Is Carefully Restored'' (June 18): ''In other notes she left, Caroline Ferriday identified ancestry of a weeping willow in the orchard. The tree came from cutting of willow growing on Isle of Elba where Napoleon lived.''</p>
        <p>An 1896 monograph (Charlotte Malvina Bulkley, Southport, ''Reminiscences of the Past'') identifies a willow in Southport as grown from a tree ''planted on Buonaparte's grave on the island of St. Helena [sic], where he died in 1821. Mr. Joseph Sheffield, of New Haven, [founder of Sheffield Scientific School at Yale], obtained several slips, on his last trip abroad, giving the above to his sister who then owned the property.''</p>
        <p>The ''Napoleon willow'' on Willow Street in Southport was blown down in a storm in 1901, according to an article printed on January 3, 1931 in the Fairfield News.</p>
