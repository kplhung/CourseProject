        <p>In a project announced last week by the Department of Energy, which owns the laboratory, groundwater with more than 100 times more tritium than the drinking-water standard will be pumped from areas near the domed building that houses the High Flux Beam Reactor, which has been closed for three years.

        <p>MORE than 15 years after radioactive tritium began leaking from a research reactor at Brookhaven National Laboratory, the laboratory and government agencies have agreed on a plan to remove the highest concentrations from groundwater.</p>
        <p>In a project announced last week by the Department of Energy, which owns the laboratory, groundwater with more than 100 times more tritium than the drinking-water standard will be pumped from areas near the domed building that houses the High Flux Beam Reactor, which has been closed for three years. Pumping began last week.</p>
        <p>The contaminated water is to be shipped to a private disposal facility in Tennessee.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department and the laboratory had discussed allowing the tritium to dissipate naturally. Tritium, a byproduct of the operation of the reactor, has a half-life of 12.3 years, meaning it loses half its radioactivity in that time.</p>
        <p>But the pumping program reflects an insistence on extraction from community groups and government agencies, including the Suffolk County Department of Health Services, the state Health Department and the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The federal Environmental Protection Agency also supported extraction.</p>
        <p>John Meersman, manager of the laboratory's environmental restoration division, said an extraction system, pumping at a slow rate, would focus on areas with more than 2 million picocuries of tritium per liter of water. The drinking water standard is 20,000 picocuries. (A picocurie is a measure of radioactivity.)</p>
        <p>''The tritium tends to be at the top of the plume, so what we are trying to do is to surgically remove the highest concentrations,'' Mr. Meersman said.</p>
        <p>The plan also calls for maintaining wells that pump water with far lower concentrations of tritium from the plume's leading edge, about three-quarters of a mile from the building, to a recharge basin near the center of the lab's property.</p>
        <p>The goal, the Energy Department said, is ''to insure that tritium levels are below the drinking-water standard'' before the plume reaches the lab's boundary.</p>
        <p>John H. Marburger, the laboratory director, said the operation was an ''extremely conservative'' approach that would assure levels of tritium were reduced as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>He said adoption of the plan, which also involves cleanups of strontium-90 and chemical contaminants in groundwater, marked ''a turning point in actually getting the work done.''</p>
        <p>''From here on in, it's a very routine process of pumping and treating and monitoring and disposing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But a critic of the lab, William N. Smith of Fish Unlimited, on Shelter Island, said the plan failed to specify how much water would be pumped.</p>
        <p>''There are tens of millions of gallons of contaminated groundwater moving at the rate of one foot per day off B.N.L.'s site,'' he said. ''If B.N.L. thinks that removing a few thousand gallons will be enough, they are in for a big surprise.''</p>
        <p>Scott Cullen, the counsel to Standing for Truth About Radiation of East Hampton, said the plan's goal of only reducing radioactive contamination by enough to conform with drinking-water standards was troublesome.</p>
        <p>''They put the contamination there, and they should be responsible for cleaning all of it up,'' he said. ''Instead, they are assuming that the drinking-water standard provides adequate protection, and the more we learn about radiation, the more we learn that it is more dangerous than we originally believed.''</p>
        <p>Critics of the laboratory also continue to assert that the full extent of contamination on and off the laboratory property has yet to be uncovered.</p>
        <p>Last week the Community Alliance for Lab Accountability, a coalition of environmental and public health groups, cited a recent Suffolk County finding of elevated levels of uranium-233 in sand filter beds at the lab's sewage-treatment plants.</p>
        <p>The coalition said the county's tests, carried out with the lab's consent, marked the first finding of uranium-233 ''as a contaminant on the lab site.''</p>
        <p>''Uranium-233 is man-made and 30,000 times more radioactive than uranium-238, and this material should be taken seriously,'' the group said. The laboratory has reported small amounts of uranium-238 and plutonium, among other contaminants, in the area of the treatment plant.</p>
        <p>The group said the discovery of uranium-233 heightened concerns about an unresolved proposal to remove radioactive contamination near the sewage treatment plant, which is at the headwaters of the Peconic River. Excavation that accidentally released plutonium in the air, it said, would be potentially catastrophic.</p>
        <p>The laboratory says the uranium-233 readings were minimal and not a cause for concern.</p>
        <p>Glenn E. VanSickle, a program manager in the laboratory's environmental restoration division, said an analysis last year of samples from the same area, using different testing methods than those used by the county, combined uranium-233 and uranium-234. He said that the combined levels were low, and that uranium-233, if present in the lab's sample, was in concentrations that were not a health concern.</p>
        <p>The plan approved last week is directed at underwater plumes of radioactivity and chemical contamination coming from central and southern areas of the 5,300-acre site. It advances an overall federal Superfund cleanup that began in 1989, for which the Energy Department has budgeted more than $260 million over the next six years.</p>
        <p>Under this plan, strontium-90 would be removed from groundwater near the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor and from two other sites on the grounds. That reactor, which closed in 1969, had operating problems that resulted in the release of strontium-90 into groundwater and soil.</p>
        <p>Extraction wells will employ an ion-exchange system in which a resin strips strontium from water inside closed cartridges, which would be shipped away for disposal.</p>
        <p>The plan also significantly extends cleanup efforts for a large plume of volatile organic compounds, or V.O.C.'s, that has migrated in groundwater to the south of the property. The compounds come from pesticides and solvents used at the lab during more than 50 years of operation in a once-remote pine barrens. As the area became more residential, the Energy Department paid to extend public water to some homes where private wells showed contamination.</p>
        <p>The V.O.C. cleanup will continue to rely on four on- and off-site treatment systems, but will add seven systems on laboratory property and at several off-site locations, including Brookhaven Airport, which is two miles from the lab. The treatment involves air-stripping of contaminants from water inside the well heads.</p>
        <p>The laboratory will also test for chemical contamination in deeper supplies of water in the Magothy aquifer, which is beneath the Upper Glacial aquifer and the source of most public water. Adrienne Esposito, the associate executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment, said water in the deeper aquifer should also be tested for tritium and other radionuclides.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith, of Fish Unlimited, said the plans to locate a treatment system at Brookhaven Airport showed that contamination had traveled ''a much greater distance than ever admitted before.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Marburger said notions of undiscovered contamination off the laboratory grounds were unfounded. ''There are certainly no plumes off site that we don't know about,'' he said. ''There may be some undiscovered ones on site, but they would have to be very, very localized in order to escape our network of monitoring wells.''</p>
        <p>In the case of the leak from the High Flux Beam Reactor, the elevated levels of tritium were discovered immediately after the laboratory, at the urging of Suffolk County, installed test wells outside the building in late 1996. Early in 1997, Energy Department officials said the leak had begun at least 12 years previously, based on the extent of the plume.</p>
        <p>The reactor, closed at the time for routine maintenance, never resumed operation. Earlier this year Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced it would remain closed permanently.</p>
