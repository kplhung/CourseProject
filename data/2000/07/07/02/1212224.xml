        <p>INSTEAD of muckrakers, they call themselves ''pot stirrers.'' They are the fearless operators of a growing number of independent local news Web sites in Westchester.</p>

        <p>INSTEAD of muckrakers, they call themselves ''pot stirrers.'' They are the fearless operators of a growing number of independent local news Web sites in Westchester.</p>
        <p>''If we don't stir things up, stuff sticks to the bottom,'' said Eugene A. Lugo, who a year ago established www.crisis-yonkers.org, an information site and discussion page focused on the city's public schools.</p>
        <p>And while the Web sites do not generate income, their authors say their goal for now is not to make money but to offer the public an alternative to the traditional news media.</p>
        <p>''People interested in my site are sick and tired of getting stonewalled by the establishment,'' Mr. Lugo said, referring to government officials who won't tell the public the real facts and to the traditional press, which he said often fails to publish the ''news behind the news.''</p>
        <p>''My purpose is to provide another side of the story because the powers that be often spin events to fit their own purposes,'' he said. His site gets about 100 visitors a day, and sometimes, for instance, during a teachers' strike he can get up to 500 hits a day.</p>
        <p>The Web masters also say that their news is more local than even that provided by their local newspapers, and that their information is delivered in a more timely manner, because the Web is not bound by traditional print deadlines.</p>
        <p>Moreover, their reporting style differs from that of the traditional media. For example, because much of the information Mr. Lugo reports on is controversial and garnered by nontraditional means (from anonymous sources, for example) he often uses opinion to comment on news and issues, thereby avoiding libel lawsuits. ''I can also state things in the form of hearsay or rumor,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lugo, who manages an audio store, calls his site Crisis, an acronym for Citizens Representing Interested Stakeholders in the Schools. The wallpaper on his site -- patterns from a chain link fence -- are there ''to remind you of institutionalized thinking and what it can lead to,'' Mr. Lugo said.</p>
        <p>Also in Yonkers, Anthony J. Iovine, a 28-year-old journalism school graduate, is spurred on by his desire to bring behind-the-scenes news to the public.</p>
        <p>His Web site primarily focuses on City Hall and is found at www.Yonkerscitizen .com.</p>
        <p>''Exclusive!'' a headline read recently, referring to a reported feud between State Senator Nicholas A. Spano and Mayor John D. Spencer of Yonkers. ''Spano Set to Respond to Spencer Letter.''</p>
        <p>The idea for Mr. Iovine's Web site was born in 1998, when he was working in City Hall. ''There was a concern among many people that the local press wasn't covering the real news,'' he said, ''so a group of us got together to create a monthly newspaper to delve deeper into issues.''</p>
        <p>The monthly paper never materialized, but Mr. Iovine, a columnist with the alternative newspaper The Westchester County Weekly, began sending out news dispatches by e-mail. At the suggestion of friends last summer, he decided to be in charge of a Web site. In May alone, Mr. Iovine said his site got more than 35,000 hits.</p>
        <p>''I can do on the Web what I can't do through traditional channels,'' he said. ''As a student of journalism history, it's like turning back the clock to the late 1700's and 1800's when the press was tough on politicians -- not so much on their personal lives, like they are today, but on how the politicians were doing their jobs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Iovine (pronounced EYE-o-veen) said he often uses anonymous sources from inside City Hall and Albany for his reports. Many, he said, are afraid they will lose their jobs if their names are used. ''Off the record is one thing,'' he explained. ''Then I won't use the information. But if they don't want their name used, that's O.K. with me.''</p>
        <p>Margaret Mintz is a Web master with a somewhat different goal in mind -- although her focus is also the news. Writing from her Yorktown bedroom -- she has health problems that keep her at home -- Mrs. Mintz concentrates on issues, like the environment or development, that affect her neighbors in the Mohegan Lake area. She said the site -- http://www.moheganlake.com/news/ news.htm -- receives close to 1,000 hits a month.</p>
        <p>''Even local newspapers don't carry stories that are local enough for some of us,'' Mrs. Mintz said. ''We want really local news, like what happened at last night's homeowners' association meeting. A Web site like mine fills a real gap.''</p>
        <p>In addition to her small computer, she uses an old flatbed scanner and a single phone line. Her costs, like those for most independent Web masters: about $300 a year for the host server, the phone and a listing on search engines.</p>
        <p>In White Plains, there are two local news Web sites. One, called the CitizeNet Reporter, was started in February by John Bailey, a White Plains resident and a former direct mail advertising copywriter and reporter for a Long Island weekly paper.</p>
        <p>''Is there something going on in your neighborhood?'' Mr. Bailey asks on his home page. ''White Plains CitizeNetReporter is your voice!''</p>
        <p>He asks residents to call or e-mail him with news and information, ''because the Internet,'' he said, ''can focus on local issues that other media can't.'' In just five months, the new Web site (wpcitizenetreporter .com) is recording 4,000 page hits a month.</p>
        <p>Similarly in White Plains, where a newspaper, The White Plains Watch, is published once a month, a former weekly newspaper has gone online as suburbanstreet.com. The print version of Suburban Street began as a community weekly in 1976 and eventually became a monthly with a circulation of 25,000</p>
        <p>In 1995 it stopped publishing a hard-copy edition and metamorphasized first into OpEd.com, then it became suburbanstreet.com in January. Its editor and publisher since its print days has been Jim Benerofe, a White Plains resident; its creative director is Steve Morton. The site receives more than 50,000 hits a month, Mr. Benerofe said.</p>
        <p>In Scarsdale, Linda Ettinger Lieberman, co-president of the West Quaker Ridge Neighborhood Association, maintains a Web site for about 400 families in the organization for many of the same reasons that Mrs. Mintz does -- to cover local issues.</p>
        <p>''Even though Scarsdale has a local newspaper, it still doesn't cover enough,'' said Mrs. Lieberman, echoing Mrs. Mintz's concerns in Yorktown. ''In addition, the traditional media has deadlines. We don't, so there's more immediacy with breaking news and time-sensitive materials.'' Mrs. Lieberman's site gets from 10 to 30 hits a month, she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lieberman's site can be found at Scarsdalenet.com, a creation of Sean P. Cover, a banker who is host of his Web site during the evening and weekends when he is not at work at Citigroup in Stamford.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cover established his site two years ago because he thought more information -- about meetings, events and Scarsdale facts and figures -- should be available on the Web. ''Village Hall had just a minimal site,'' he said. Since 1998, he has expanded the site to cover more news and issues.</p>
        <p>''When traffic surged, I realized there was an unmet market for news and information online,'' Mr. Cover said. ''Our weekly newspaper comes out on Fridays, but that's not enough. Now, if there's a Board of Education meeting on Monday, I can tell people about it on Tuesday.''</p>
        <p>He estimates that about 4,500 visitors use the site each month. His goal is to hire a small editorial staff, increase news coverage and ''supplant the newspaper as the preferred source of information.''</p>
        <p>To do that, though, he will need corporate sponsors, because even though he has advertising, the site is not making a profit.</p>
