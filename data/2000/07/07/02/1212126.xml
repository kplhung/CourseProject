        <p>IN 1983, Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux, recently retired as a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet, was asked to take charge of the summer ballet school at the Chautauqua Institution, a gated community of 225 acres along the shore of Chautauqua Lake, in the northwest corner of New York State. The oldest summer arts festival in America -- last year its 125th anniversary was commemorated in ''Chautauqua: An American Utopia,'' published by Harry N. Abrams -- Chautauqua was founded as an educational center in 1874 and soon incorporated musical and dramatic performances. It boasted a resident symphony orchestra, opera and drama companies, attendant music, theater and art schools, but almost no dance, apart from the fledgling school that catered mostly to the children of festival visitors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bonnefoux and his wife, the celebrated Balanchine ballerina Patricia McBride, had made guest appearances at Chautauqua in the 70's and remembered the idyllic lakeside setting and wonderful atmosphere as they performed to a rapt crowd in an enormous open-air amphitheater. Mr. Bonnefoux accepted the offer and, 18 years later, can be justly proud of his achievements.</p>
        <p>Summer by summer, he has transformed the school into one that attracts some of the country's best ballet students, with alumni like Alexandra Ansanelli and Sebastian Marcovici, now soloists at New York City Ballet. He has also made dance an integral part of Chautauqua's artistic program by forming a professional summer company that presents both new choreography and work from the classical repertory -- thus extending his activities as artistic director of the North Carolina Dance Theater in Charlotte, where he and Ms. McBride spend the other 10 months of the year. This year, the Chautauqua dance program (which started last Thursday and ends on Aug. 12) offers eight performances in the 5,000-seat amphitheater, accompanied by the Chautauqua Symphony, conducted by Akira Endo.</p>
        <p>''The dance program has come on light years,'' said Chautauqua's president, Daniel Bratton, who began his tenure in 1984. ''It's incredible to have people of the caliber of Jean-Pierre, Patty and Violette Verdy working here, and it's through their sheer determination that it has happened.'' Mr. Bonnefoux's enthusiasm and ambitions must have been clear from the outset: in his first year running the summer school, he took along two former New York City Ballet principals and colleagues, Ms. Verdy and Helgi Tomasson, as well as the School of American Ballet's Andre Kramarevsky, to teach with him.</p>
        <p>He also immediately began to present work in public. ''From the outset, I wanted to groom the dancers to perform, to be seen on stage,'' he said. ''You can't wait for them to be 'ready.' '' A donation, two years later, that enabled the building of the new Carnahan-Jackson studios, which incorporated a performance space, gave an additional boost to student presentations, often choreographed by Mr. Bonnefoux, ''because I couldn't afford anyone else!''</p>
        <p>By 1989, the success of the dance school was such that he was able to convince the institution that it wouldn't cost a great deal of money to establish a small professional company. (''I'm not sure how I did that,'' he said, wryly.) Since then, every year 14 to 20 dancers, some of them former students, some selected by audition or word of mouth, have come from all over the United States to form a temporary troupe.</p>
        <p>''Jean-Pierre's idea was that we could employ dancers who are laid off over the summer,'' Ms. McBride said, ''and it has worked beautifully. They are paid, their housing and food taken care of, and they have the chance to work with wonderful teachers, choreographers and musicians.''</p>
        <p>One of these teachers is Ms. Verdy (now head of the dance department at Indiana University), who has returned to Chautauqua every year since 1983 and works with both the professional company and the students. ''If one believes that art is excellence and leads to spiritual understanding, then that's what you have in Chautauqua,'' she said. ''It's a cultural oasis; there are people who have been going for generations.'' (In fact, the return rate at Chautauqua, according to Marty Merkley, the director of programming, is around 80 percent, and the institution does little aggressive self-promotion, which explains how a festival attracting 140,000 people annually remains so little known.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Verdy said that although the caliber of the students has improved greatly, the emphasis has always been on ''giving the students a sense of what it is like to perform, how to give something an audience wants to buy a ticket for.''</p>
        <p>This accent on performing makes Chautauqua somewhat different from most summer schools: although the students (divided into two groups: the advanced ''festival'' level, 14 to 17 years old, and the ''workshop'' level, 11 to 13 years old) have a full program of daily ballet, jazz and modern classes -- with an extra point work and variation class in the afternoon for the older girls -- the focus of their stay in Chautauqua is learning and rehearsing the ballets that they will perform before an audience.</p>
        <p>W E always try to do Balanchine with both the students and the company,'' Ms. McBride said, ''because it's the best way for them to progress; it really takes them a step higher. The Balanchine Trust has been wonderful about granting permission: we've done 'Stars and Stripes,'  'The Four Temperaments,'  'Rubies,'  'Western Symphony,'  'Donizetti Variations' and 'Valse Fantasie,' and this year we're doing 'Allegro Brillante' for the company and 'Raymonda Variations' for the older students.''</p>
        <p>In addition to learning the Balanchine repertory from firsthand sources, both the students and professional dancers work with invited choreographers on entirely new pieces. Over the years, Mr. Bonnefoux has invited a broad range of choreographers to Chautauqua, including Peter Pucci, Alonso King, Graham Lustig, Lynn Taylor-Corbett and John Clifford, who has returned 10 times and has created some 20 ballets there.</p>
        <p>''It's a wonderful place to work,'' Mr. Clifford said. ''Everything is completely open, so people watch rehearsals, you see them the morning after the performance, and you get a lot of feedback. Balanchine always said that ballet is a craft as well as an art, and Chautauqua is a place to really work on your craft. You usually have one week to choreograph, one week to rehearse, and then they're onstage.''</p>
        <p>For the last five years, Mr. Bonnefoux has also invited the former Martha Graham principals Terese Capucilli, Donlin Foreman and Jacqulyn Buglisi, of the Buglisi/Foreman Dance Company, to teach and present their own work in studio performances. ''We work our schedules around getting to Chautauqua,'' Ms. Buglisi said. ''For us, there is an incredible connection to the audience there, and it's very satisfying to try to bring aspects of physicality to the students that ballet coaching doesn't cover.''</p>
        <p>This year, Mr. Bonnefoux has also invited a number of dancers and musicians from India, Africa, China and the Caribbean to take part in an evening of world dance, ''to really show people what diversity exists.'' The rest of the program includes a piece by Mr. Bonnefoux and premieres by Christian Holder, Mark Godden and the resident choreographer, Mark Diamond in a salon evening set to chamber music pieces, a pas de deux program of mostly new works (one of these by an 18-year-old former student, Jessica Miller), the Balanchine ballets, and a full-length ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' by Mr. Diamond, who is also on the faculty of the North Carolina Dance School.</p>
        <p>A full-evening work with 14 dancers and students? ''We've done 'Swan Lake,'  'Sleeping Beauty' and 'Coppelia' in the past,'' Mr. Bonnefoux said. ''We have no fear.''</p>
