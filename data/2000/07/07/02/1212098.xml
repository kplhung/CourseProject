        <p>Q: Everybody has tried to give you advice about your recent problems throwing the baseball to first base. Would you ever give advice to another person who was struggling with something?</p>
        <p>I don't think I would give unsolicited advice. You don't know how the person is going to react if you come up to them and start talking about something they don't want to talk about. I think the people have good intentions and are trying to help. I understand that, but I don't know what to say about the advice. It's not like you're really going to try it unless it's someone who has experience in the field.</p>

        <p>Q: Everybody has tried to give you advice about your recent problems throwing the baseball to first base. Would you ever give advice to another person who was struggling with something?</p>
        <p>I don't think I would give unsolicited advice. You don't know how the person is going to react if you come up to them and start talking about something they don't want to talk about. I think the people have good intentions and are trying to help. I understand that, but I don't know what to say about the advice. It's not like you're really going to try it unless it's someone who has experience in the field.</p>
        <p>Then what did you think of the newspaper that polled elementary school kids and asked them to give you advice?</p>
        <p>That's ridiculous. What does a Little Leaguer know about playing Major League Baseball? That would be like giving advice to some C.E.O. about how to run his company. That's not right. That's ludicrous. I've been working my whole life to get to this point.</p>
        <p>O.K., but is there anything nice about knowing that people care enough to send you a letter or shout out some advice?</p>
        <p>It is touching to hear from the fans, especially the at-bat at Yankee Stadium when I came back. That was emotional. I almost had to take a 20-second timeout. It made you realize that the fans of New York are great and they want to cheer you and see you do well.</p>
        <p>How much worse has this whole thing been because you are out there in front of 50,000 fans a night with millions more watching on TV?</p>
        <p>It comes with the territory. That's our job as entertainers. People go to the game to be entertained. It definitely makes it tougher. More and more people know about it and you can't run from it. There's nowhere to go, you know?</p>
        <p>How much less taxing would this be if you were second baseman for a Division III college somewhere?</p>
        <p>If you're competitive and you have that desire and you enjoy playing baseball, it would still be taxing. It might be easier to solve it because there aren't as many eyes watching what you do. It's interesting in this world that no matter what kind of problem or difficulty you have, there are thousands of people who can relate to you. I'm a firm believer in Everything happens for a reason. Let's take Darryl Strawberry with his cancer. I'm sure he helped thousands of people deal with it. Look, here's this professional athlete that people think is invincible, and he's dealing with what I'm dealing with.</p>
        <p>Has any part of this ordeal been funny to you?</p>
        <p>It's not funny at the time, but when you look back at some of the throws, they are funny. You have to be able to laugh. It's not like I'm walking down the street with a dark cloud hanging over my head. I still do the same things I've done all my life. When I take this uniform off, if I'm not thinking about baseball, I'm a strong, healthy everyday guy. In my jeans and T-shirt and walking around, I'm fine.</p>
        <p>Does it ever get to you when you're taunted at opposing stadiums?</p>
        <p>You've been in this arena so long that you get used to it. You develop a thick skin. If someone comes up with something good, you have to laugh at it. I don't think you can worry about what you can't control. You can't control what someone says or does.</p>
        <p>Has your problem made you sympathetic to other athletes who have troubles, like Shaquille O'Neal?</p>
        <p>One hundred percent. I know that feeling. I'm sure Shaq gets tired of hearing about the free throws. I'm sure he shoots thousands of free throws a day. I'll never say anything about that. But the ultimate goal is to win a championship. If he misses a free throw or I made an error and the team still wins the game, yeah, you're disappointed in what you did, but your team still won. It's a team game. You're not out there by yourself. You can never take those three championships away from me. There is a lot of hard work that goes into that. You have to look back at last year: I didn't make any throwing errors in the postseason and nothing was said about that. But when you get that championship and that ring, it's all said and done.</p>
        <p>You have indicated that you will seek some sort of treatment for your problem, but you don't want to specify what type. Why?</p>
        <p>I think it's a personal thing. I think people should respect that. You've got to have some kind of private life, even in what we do. People get to know enough. They don't need to know everything.</p>
