        <p>A State Supreme Court justice has thrown out a Brookhaven Town law that placed a 90-day limit on gathering petitions for ballot propositions.</p>
        <p>The ruling has revived a campaign by civic groups to put a proposition on the town ballot to replace the current system of at-large election of town board members with a district system.</p>
        <p>Under such a system, proponents said, the election of board members in districts where they lived would assure that all areas of the town were equally represented and had equal voices in town affairs. Brookhaven is the largest of Long Island's 13 towns in area and has the highest population of Suffolk's 10 towns.</p>
        <p>In the ruling last week, Justice Howard Berler said the town board had exceeded its authority by imposing petition rules that exceeded requirements in state law. He also said the board's ''motives can be said to be suspect.'' The law was the basis for keeping the council vote off the ballot last November.</p>
        <p>Town officials said they disagreed with the ruling and would appeal. They said a change-over to a district system would be expensive, and defended the time limit as a way to streamline the steps for placing propositions on the ballot.</p>
        <p>Civic groups said they would immediately seek a judicial order placing the proposition on the ballot.</p>
        <p>Christopher O'Connor, Suffolk coordinator for the Long Island Neighborhood Network, said voters would approve the referendum if given the chance. ''Its chances are excellent, given overdevelopment and the sense of disenfranchisement many feel,'' he said.</p>
