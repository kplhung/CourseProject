        <p>POSTERS helped sell aviation to the world a century ago, though not until five years after Orville and Wilbur Wright flew a heavier-than-air machine for the first time at Kitty Hawk, N.C., in 1903.</p>
        <p>Even then, public interest in flying surged first not in the United States but in Europe, when Wilbur Wright brought the brothers' biplane to Le Mans, in western France, introducing it at a race course and stunning the audience with its superior performance. After that demonstration, aviation became a spectator sport.</p>
        <p>European airplane producers promptly adapted various aspects of the Wrights' technology to their monoplanes and biplanes. And French and German pilots demonstrated the improvements in their aircraft at air meets that proliferated, becoming monthly events in cities throughout Europe and North Africa like Frankfurt; Reims, France, and Helipolis, Egypt; they became as popular as rock 'n' roll concerts are today. Meanwhile, poster production, which was far more advanced on the Continent than in the United States, boomed, awakening the public to every aspect of flying. And as flight posters became increasingly colorful and diverse, they advertised more than air meets. Some promoted the planes favored by the most famous pilots, while others sold glamour, in consumer products that ranged from Champagne to furs.</p>
        <p>The little-known role of posters in popularizing flight in the early 20th century is the focus of ''Looping the Loop: Posters of Early Flight,'' the first museum exhibition on the subject in this country, on view at the National Air and Space Museum here through next Sunday. The show was organized by the museum, along with the owner of the 32 posters on view, the Allen Airways Flying Museum of El Cajon, Calif., and the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service. The show, which will travel through 2002, moves next to the Thames Science Center in Newport, R.I. (July 22 to Oct. 8), and then to the Virginia Air and Space Center in Hampton (Oct. 29 to Jan. 7, 2001).</p>
        <p>''The period covered in the show, the 1880's to 1915, represents the beginning of the consumer society,'' said Joanna Gernstein London, the curator of the exhibition. ''The public expected to participate, even if it just meant watching.''</p>
        <p>The story of flight as depicted in these posters is frequently meant to attract viewers, if not as fliers, then as buyers of whatever the poster is selling. The message was sometimes obvious, as in the earliest poster in the show, a French image from the 1880's, ''Ballon Captif,'' which depicts a tethered hot-air balloon in a fairground. The image invites the public to inspect the balloon and to float aloft in it; apparently the ploy worked, increasing attendance at the fair.</p>
        <p>Posters in the early 20th century continued to show balloons, but by then they were seen as upstaged by dirigibles and airplanes, which were depicted soaring or floating past the spires of Gothic cathedrals. With daredevil pilots demonstrating flying as a sport and entertainment, poster artists depicted flight as a fantasy, even a comedy. These conceptions would soon be replaced by darker images, of airplanes as tools of war.</p>
        <p>But in 1909, poster artists usually opted for the lighthearted approach. In a Belle Epoque poster announcing an air meet in Monte Carlo, a dapper aviator in cap, ascot, boutonniere and yellow gloves is shown at the stick of an open-air Wright biplane, a lady in red at his side looking as if she is flying through the air on an earthbound swing, not in an aircraft high above the Riviera.</p>
        <p>THAT year, too, the Frenchman Louis Bleriot crossed the English Channel in a monoplane in the first such powered flight, going from Calais to Dover in a record 37 minutes, which made him a national hero. The victory was advertised in a powerful poster by Gabriel Borel, a Paris producer of the acetylene lamps on Bleriot's aircraft, which is shown flying at night, its lamps illuminating the white cliffs of Dover just before landing.</p>
        <p>In a 1913 poster, the mood quickens in a depiction of the French pilot Adolphe Pegoud making aviation history by flying upside-down and by doing an aerial somersault over a racetrack in Hanover, Germany. Onlookers feared that his blood-tingling exhibition would be suicidal. But the thrilling feats he performed were later cited as the precursors of the combat tactics pilots mastered during World War I.</p>
        <p>The exhibition's debt to two passionate collectors of aeronautical material is clearly stated in the wall labels. The rich cultural history used in the descriptions of the posters was the work of Henry Serrano Villard, an American diplomat and writer from a prominent New York publishing family. He was introduced to aviation at age 9, when he was taken up in a plane during an air tournament at Belmont Park on Long Island. Two years later, when he moved with his family to France, he joined the Societe Generale Aeronautique and attended many of the meets celebrated in these posters, and he collected aeronautical memorabilia for the rest of his life. Villard, who became the first American ambassador to Libya in 1952 and later was ambassador to Senegal and Mauritania, retired from foreign service in 1961 and wrote several books on early aviation. The last of these bears the same title as the show, and was published by Kales Press ($40) of Carlsbad, Calif., after his death at 95 in 1996.</p>
        <p>The posters in the exhibition and the book were assembled by Willis M. Allen Jr., who showed a bit of daring when he ignored a warning printed on the Monte Carlo poster, a piece of ephemera that was never meant to be owned privately. It says, ''Anyone found in possession of this poster will be prosecuted.''</p>
