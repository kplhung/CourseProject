        <p>WHEN the sidewalks of Hunts Point feel like a river of molten metal flows beneath, hundreds of residents jump into their cars and head to a spot in an empty warehouse district so far from everything that no subways, buses or anything else go there.</p>
        <p>This spot is down the block from La Playita, an East River pier, and down Viele Avenue near the salvage yard. On Sundays, 200 to 2,000 people, mostly Puerto Ricans, gather on Drake Street, sitting against the wall of a shuttered warehouse, leaning on picnic tables or standing in the broad road, arms folded, amid the whir of a generator.</p>

        <p>WHEN the sidewalks of Hunts Point feel like a river of molten metal flows beneath, hundreds of residents jump into their cars and head to a spot in an empty warehouse district so far from everything that no subways, buses or anything else go there.</p>
        <p>This spot is down the block from La Playita, an East River pier, and down Viele Avenue near the salvage yard. On Sundays, 200 to 2,000 people, mostly Puerto Ricans, gather on Drake Street, sitting against the wall of a shuttered warehouse, leaning on picnic tables or standing in the broad road, arms folded, amid the whir of a generator.</p>
        <p>From a truck, Ray A. Lopez, organizer of the Sunday events, sells bacalaitos, fish fritters; arroz con habichuelas, rice and beans; and other Puerto Rican specialties, like alcapurrias, akin to meat patties.</p>
        <p>The food, they say, is ''muy autentico,'' but what everyone has come for is the music: on a typical Sunday five or six conjuntos, small Puerto Rican bands, might be playing on Drake Street. Their doleful ballads, bachatas, strengthen a yearning, evoke a memory, bring a tear to an old woman's eye. On occasion, the bands pick up the tempo with merengue, rumba, or cha-cha. Sometimes, a Cuban band will sit in and play son, Cuban folk music.</p>
        <p>Most people don't dance, just listen. Some, like Blanca Alvarado, who has gone there just about every Sunday for 15 years, sing along nostalgically. Carlos Capitan wanders through the crowd, calling ''Coquito, coquito,'' to advertise a white coconut drink speckled with cinnamon and ''just a touch'' of rum, which he brews at home, pours into  glass bottles and sells for $5. A souped-up Grand Prix rolls by slowly; a decal in the back window reads, ''Viva Su Vida, No La Mia.'' (''Live Your Life, Not Mine.'')</p>
        <p>On a recent Sunday, the band was Los Supremos, which featured a guitar, maracas, bongos, a requinto (a type of guitar), and a guiro, or scraping gourd. Victor Manuel, who sings with the band, writes songs based on old Dominican tunes.</p>
        <p>''It's traditional music,'' Mr. Manuel said.  ''I write songs for my children, so they know how much I love them.'' He pointed out the names of his songs: ''Kimberly,'' for his younger daughter; ''Jennifer,'' for his older one; and ''Onix'' for his son. ''I also write for the women,'' he said, noting one title, ''Mujeres Divinas,'' divine women.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manuel plays all over the city, but he said he loved to play on Drake Street, for just a few dollars. ''It's just the atmosphere here,'' he said. ''It's part of us. You can either go to another place and ask for a lot of money, or you can come here and you do it for the heart.''</p>
        <p>Then he made a promise.</p>
        <p>''You stay out here a few hours and you'll see,'' he said. ''I'm going to sing a song out here about mothers and fathers from Puerto Rico, and everyone will break into tears.''</p>
