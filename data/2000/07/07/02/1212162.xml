        <p>Much of next week the Hudson and New York Harbor will be filled with tall ships, sailboats and other craft for OpSail 2000.  The festivities will be overseen by the United States Coast Guard. One of the Coast Guard units on the scene will be the Atlantic Strike Team, which responds to environmental emergencies. The team is based at Fort Dix and consists of 38 men and women on active duty and 50 reserve.

        <p>Much of next week the Hudson and New York Harbor will be filled with tall ships, sailboats and other craft for OpSail 2000.  The festivities will be overseen by the United States Coast Guard. One of the Coast Guard units on the scene will be the Atlantic Strike Team, which responds to environmental emergencies. The team is based at Fort Dix and consists of 38 men and women on active duty and 50 reserve. The commander is Gail Kulisch, a former Coast Guard ship commander, executive officer, navigator and marine environmental response officer. Commander Kulisch, who assumed her post June 9, talked recently about her team's work.</p>
        <p>Q. What will the Atlantic Strike Team do at OpSail?</p>
        <p>A. We will be providing our command post at the staging area to support the operational commanders who are staffing up substantially to maintain the safety zone. We're also going to have some of our small boats ready to go, to coordinate any pollution response, and we're staging additional capabilities at Fort Dix.</p>
        <p>Q. What is a Coast Guard unit doing in the middle of the Pine Barrens?</p>
        <p>A. This is really a fantastic place for a unit of national strike force capability to be located because we serve a very large region that goes from the Great Lakes, the Atlantic Seaboard, Canada, and we support international activities as well, in Europe and the Middle East. We can deploy by air. We can deploy very well by road. We have lots of space for our equipment. We've got great support from the base for our people. So it  really does work out well.</p>
        <p>Q. What was one of the incidents you responded to recently?</p>
        <p>A. We went to Jackson, Mich., on the 8th of June when about 100,000 gallons of gasoline leaked from a pipeline. We support the E.P.A., and they asked us to come in. The community had to be evacuated, 400 plus homes. So our folks went out there with our skills in coordinating these kinds of large-scale events, and with some equipment and we supervised the response on behalf of the federal government. We were there seven days getting the gasoline cleaned up  and getting people safely back into their homes.</p>
        <p>Q. So you respond on land as well as water?  A. This is something people don't know about the Coast Guard. If there is a hazardous material release, a chemical release anywhere in the environment, it doesn't matter if there 's water or you're out in the middle of cornfield in Illinois, we respond to that too. So chemicals anywhere -- and oil and gas and petroleum products where they impact or might impact navigable water, which if you think of all the creeks that run around, that's really a lot of what you would consider inland.</p>
        <p>Q. Are there any incidents you responded to here in New Jersey?</p>
        <p>A. We actually did substantial work in New Jersey for Hurricane Floyd in October 1999. In the initial phases of the hurricane our team rescued 29 lives during the flood response during the first 24 hours of the operation and then we spent four weeks there in three New Jersey counties conducting assessments and supervising hazardous materials clean up and hazardous waste.</p>
        <p>Q. What would you like people to know about your team?</p>
        <p>A. We have absolutely outstanding people who care about what they do.  When they arrive on the scene, they can take any situation that is out of control and bring a measure of order and structure and go about the business of protecting the public.</p>
