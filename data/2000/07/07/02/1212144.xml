        <p>LIKE fireworks -- loud, dazzling, pleasing and scary to the most impressionable -- ''The Patriot,'' the new movie starring Mel Gibson, will prove to many a satisfying way to spend a summer evening. It's got big battles and wrenching hand-to-hand combat, a courageous but conflicted hero and a dastardly and totally guilt-free villain, thrills, tenderness, sorrow, rage and a little bit of kissing. There is just enough brain bran to keep the post-film discussions from being dominated by people who want to focus on how cool it was when Mel hit that guy with the hatchet. Why, some may think it's the best Revolutionary War movie ever made.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to our point: it is also one of the very few Revolutionary War movies ever made, most of which are not all that good. Disney's ''Johnny Tremain'' (1957) is shallow and childish, hardly a fair representation of Esther Forbes's flinty and hardheaded novel; it even features a cringe-inducing moment when smiling Sons of Liberty stroll the streets of Boston singing a kind of fight song. John Ford's ''Drums Along the Mohawk'' (1939) just transplants the Ford formula and stock company from Monument Valley in 1876 to the Mohawk Valley in 1776. There the simple, amiable, good-hearted and altogether too cute rustics turn ferocious when their settlements are threatened by Indians; the British are nearly invisible, represented almost entirely by a vulpine, eye-patched John Carradine, who incites the Indians to commit their atrocities. ''1776'' (1972) is a pretty good parlor trick; not all that great a musical, and not all that great a drama about declaring independence, it's an engaging melding of the two. It now seems to have found a niche as an educational tool for fifth-graders getting their first exposure to United States history. Hugh Hudson's ''Revolution'' (1985), starring Al Pacino, is just awful; dark, murky and poorly plotted, its box office toxicity warned future filmmakers with head-on-a-pike firmness to stay away from this theme. Which may explain why the sluggish ''Jefferson in Paris'' (1995) takes place entirely after the Revolution. There is also ''The Devil's Disciple'' (1959), a pretty good adaptation of Shaw's play set during the Revolution, and Robert Stack as ''John Paul Jones'' (1959), George Arliss in ''Alexander Hamilton'' (1931), a bad 1940 Cary Grant movie called ''The Howards of Virginia,'' and ''Funky Phantom,'' which according to the Internet Movie Data Base (www.imdb.com) is a 1971 movie about ''three teens and the ghost of a patriot from the American Revolution who set across the country to uphold justice and fight for freedom.'' This isn't an exhaustive list -- it omits a few silents and some minor talkies -- but it does appear we've managed to pick out the biggest chunks.</p>

This isn't an exhaustive list -- it omits a few silents and some minor talkies -- but it does appear we've managed to pick out the biggest chunks.</p>
        <p>Think for a moment about what isn't there. Where's that George Washington biopic starring Gary Cooper? The quiet, iconic action-loving movie star would have done a good job playing the quiet, iconic, action-loving father of his country. Errol Flynn portrayed everybody from the Earl of Essex to Jeb Stuart, went everywhere from the Crimea in ''The Charge of the Light Brigade'' to the Little Big Horn in ''They Died With Their Boots On''; where's his Paul Revere? (Granted, while Flynn seems perfect for the midnight ride part, he might not have been up to the silversmithing aspect of the gig.) Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Gregory Peck -- any of them would have done a good job besting the libertine General Johnny Burgoyne (Laurence Harvey, maybe, or Dirk Bogarde) at Saratoga, the turning point of the war (and wouldn't John Wayne have been perfect as Col. Daniel Morgan, the big heroic rifleman who once took 500 lashes for slugging a British officer?). Did no one think to connect the rebels of '76 with the rebellious kids of the 60's: consider a Boston Tea Party with Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Jones and Yvette Mimieux, Richard Lester directing. And what about the dark, dark story of Benedict Arnold -- hero of the revolution, general of the army -- who betrays the cause when he falls for the beautiful Tory debutante Peggy Shippen; Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson would surely have done something interesting with this tale of self-destruction on a historic scale. Instead, ''Funky Phantom.'' We cast about for explanations.</p>
        <p>''In my 50 years of making motion pictures,'' said David Brown, the dean of Hollywood producers, ''when it came to stories about American history, particularly stories about the American Revolution, the prevailing opinion, beginning with the studio moguls like Zanuck and Selznick, was that the box office would be bad. Jack Warner had a classic rule. 'I don't want any pictures,' he would say, 'where they write with a feather.' ''</p>
        <p>But obviously the old-time moguls allowed a lot of feather-writers to make it to the screen -- Queen Elizabeth and the Armada, Lady Caroline and Admiral Nelson, Napoleon and Josephine, and multiple versions of ''The Scarlet Pimpernel,''  ''A Tale of Two Cities'' and ''War and Peace.'' There was even the Spencer Tracy movie about the French and Indian War, ''Northwest Passage'' (which, in combination with Michael Mann's splendid ''Last of the Mohicans,'' means there have been more good movies about that conflict than about the War for Independence.) It's not period pieces the moguls didn't like; it's the American Revolution.</p>
        <p>Y OU have to remember,'' said Mr. Brown, who himself has tried to develop the story of George Washington, ''that a lot of these men came from Eastern Europe, and they were Anglophiles. A lot of us had the sense that through these movies they somehow wanted to endear themselves to the aristocrats who threw them out.'' The film historian David Thomson also points to their Anglophilia, as well as the extent to which the moguls were keeping an eye on the passions of their own times. ''They were very against the idea of revolution and revolutionary views. They saw it in Europe, and they were afraid of it happening in America.'' Along these lines, perhaps it was not entirely irrelevant to their thinking that America's enemy in the Revolution just happened to have been our ally in two world wars and a cold war. Why go out of your way to dredge up some long-reconciled misunderstandings when they was a globe full of German, Japanese and Russian enemies to conquer before the credits roll?</p>
        <p>Mogul psychology notwithstanding, some people -- historians -- who would love to see more Revolutionary War movies are nonetheless sympathetic to the view that the Revolutionary era is not easy for modern audiences to understand.</p>
        <p>''A lot of us have trouble at first perceiving those people as real,'' said the historian David McCullough, whose biography of John Adams will be published next year. ''Because of their clothing, and the wigs, and their mannered way of speaking, they are like characters in a costume pageant.</p>
        <p>''Also, we're handicapped because they don't appear in photographs. One reason we find the Civil War more accessible, and why there have been more movies about it, is that we've seen the Civil War soldiers, and we identify with them much more readily than we do with those in the Revolution.''</p>
        <p>Joseph J. Ellis, whose 1997 biography of Thomas Jefferson, ''American Sphinx,'' won the National Book Award, said: ''The lack of realistic images means that all we see are paintings and iconographic renderings that all have a celebratory, patriotic, posed quality. Because the movies are realistic, they have a hard time measuring up. It's like when I was a kid, and I loved listening to the Lone Ranger on the radio. When I finally saw him on TV, I was disappointed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellis also sees the big differences between the eras as a factor.</p>
        <p>''They are, despite what Tom Brokaw says, really our greatest generation, but they are also kind of a lost generation. Remember, they are pre-modern -- pre-Marx, pre-Freud, pre-Darwin, pre-Stravinsky, pre-Keynes, and they are covered with this patriotic haze. They are sufficiently different from us that it really requires a willingness on our part to put ourselves back to a time that is really lost.'' They are also different from us on the crucial matter of slavery; as William Hallahan, author of ''The Day the American Revolution Began,'' pointed out: ''It's very hard for today's audiences to root for a slaveholder. We're very quick to spot hypocrisy in our current politicians, and these guys, even the non-slaveholders, though great and brilliant men, all have feet of clay.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellis said: ''Coming to terms with your father is always a tricky thing. One is never really capable of seeing them with complete detachment, and these men are our political fathers. We are still living with their institutions.''</p>
        <p>As ''The Patriot'' shows, however, the challenge of creating characters that can be understood by modern audiences is hardly insuperable. Mel Gibson's Benjamin Martin is pretty modern: devoted to his family, wracked by guilt, and possessed of a Bob Vila-esque interest in furniture-making. And although he is a South Carolina planter, he is not a slave owner but an employer of freed blacks, a circumstance that the film's advisers, from the Smithsonian Institution, found completely credible. (It helped that the Martin plantation is in the back country, not the low country, where slavery was prevalent.) Martin does not seem to possess the hip, edgy, self-referential sense of humor of many moderns; but then, he's better with a flintlock.</p>
        <p>The ''Patriot'' screenwriter, Robert Rodat, who also wrote the screenplay for ''Saving Private Ryan,'' saw the connective tissue early on in his research phase, when he read the letters and journals of the colonists. ''I was struck by how immediate they felt,'' he said. ''They were very much like the letters and journals I read for 'Saving Private Ryan.' Their concerns were identical: duty and family.''</p>
        <p>ROLAND EMMERICH, director of ''The Patriot,'' said: ''I'm always skeptical about historical dramas. But I could see that these were characters I could relate to, and they were engaged in a conflict that had a significant outcome -- the creation of the first modern democratic government.'' It does not come as much of a surprise to hear that the first thing Mr. Emmerich did after reading the screenplay, which he liked immediately, was to thumb through a film guide, looking to see if this kind of film had been done before, wondering why it hadn't. It's encouraging that the studio, Sony, showed no a priori aversion to the subject.</p>
        <p>''I hope this movie is a good one,'' said Mr. McCullough, who would like to see the film spark interest in the Revolution the way ''Saving Private Ryan'' rekindled interest in World War II. ''The importance of what those people accomplished cannot be overstated, and under those costumes and wigs they were as vivid and as capable as any generation in our history. To fight and get shot and to die like that, to suffer disease and hunger and really horrible conditions, to be poorly clothed, poorly fed, and poorly led, and to still fight on? They were as strong as any characters! To have been in Philadelphia in the first days of July in 1776, knowing that the British had just landed 32,000 troops -- a force larger than the population of Philadelphia -- in Staten Island, just a day and a half's march away, and to still declare independence? These are characters! These are stories!''</p>
        <p>Regardless of what they wrote with.</p>
