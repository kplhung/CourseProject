        <p>John Avery, a tourist from Birmingham, England, had only one complaint about his ride through Manhattan in a New York Apple Tours double-decker bus yesterday.</p>
        <p>''The roads need repairs,'' Mr. Avery grumbled after a bumpy 40-minute ride from West 57th Street to West Fourth Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Avery, 62, was among the hundreds of tourists who boarded the nearly 60 Apple Tours buses on the road yesterday. It was the company's second day of operation since a panel of state appellate judges on Monday rebuffed city and state efforts to sideline the buses while regulators try to shut down the company.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Avery, in town with his wife, Sue, did not care about Apple Tours's problems with the city or its safety record. All he cared about was the view of the Empire State Building from the top level of the bus. ''We wanted to be able to see everything,'' he said. ''And you can't do that from the subway.''</p>
        <p>The company, which has been cited for hundreds of regulatory and safety violations in its nine years of carrying tourists around the city, became a primary target of city and state authorities after May 22, when one of its buses struck and killed a 71-year-old actor at 45th Street and Ninth Avenue in Clinton.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki issued an order pulling the registration of the company's 63 buses pending the outcome of an administrative hearing the city had begun before the accident in an effort to shut down Apple Tours. The city was acting on complaints that many Apple Tours drivers did not have commercial driver's licenses, that the buses were not environmentally certified and that they were being driven along cross streets, from which they are generally prohibited.</p>
        <p>Apple Tours challenged the order, saying it violated the company's rights to due process. On June 14, a State Supreme Court judge in Manhattan agreed, reversing the governor's order and appointing a former city official to monitor the company.</p>
        <p>The city and state filed an appeal, which kept the buses off the streets and hundreds of Apple Tours employees out of work until the appellate court ruling on Monday.</p>
        <p>Community advocates in Clinton said they were planning to post fliers to warn tourists about Apple Tours's problems. The Times Square Business Improvement District and New York City &amp; Company, the city's visitors bureau, have removed New York Apple Tours brochures from their offices and from information packets given to tourists.</p>
        <p>But none of the efforts seemed to keep the people away yesterday, the first day of one of the busiest tourist weekends. Most of the company's red double-decker buses were on the street by 6 a.m.</p>
        <p>By late morning, the buses -- packed with tourists -- were winding along crowded streets in neighborhoods like Greenwich Village and the Rockefeller Center area.</p>
        <p>Some in neighborhoods where Apple Tours has racked up violations were unhappy. John Fisher, who lives on West 45th Street in Clinton, said he was disheartened when he woke up yesterday morning to see an Apple Tours bus on his block.</p>
        <p>''The one thing that people need to understand is that this operation has not been given a clean bill of health,'' he said. ''So, we'll see.''</p>
