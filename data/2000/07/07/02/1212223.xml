        <p>SEVENTEEN years after it first proposed developing portions of a 121-acre parcel adjacent to downtown, New York Presbyterian Hospital says it is time to act.</p>
        <p>The hospital, which operates its psychiatric division here on a campus designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, has proposed a $300 million retail and residential development on land it owns surrounding the campus.</p>
        <p>It would include an anchor store, similar in size to the nearby Bloomingdale's, an additional 225,000 square feet of retail space, 480 housing units and a hotel and conference center. To sweeten the deal, the hospital has offered to give the city 60 acres to create what would be the biggest park in White Plains.</p>
        <p>But the plan requires zoning approval, and many city officials and nearby residents have called it far too ambitious. ''Our primary feeling was that the retail development was much too large,'' said Marjorie Davies, who headed a League of Women Voters study of the plan.</p>
        <p>As a result, the hospital has offered an alternative $96 million plan -- which it says does not require zoning approval -- for new medical and research buildings and, eventually, housing for hospital personnel. This plan, however, does not include any land for a park. And unlike the first plan, the new buildings would be tax exempt.</p>
        <p>On July 10, the Common Council is to consider the two plans. It must decide whether to refer the original proposal (known as Plan A) to other city agencies for study. It must also  decide whether the second proposal (Plan B) conforms with the hospital's current permit.</p>
        <p>With five of the Council's seven members expressing reservations about Plan A, its referral to other agencies seems unlikely.</p>
        <p>Some city officials have charged that Plan B, including the threatened loss of the park, was intended to put pressure on the city to refer Plan A to the other agencies. But Geoff Thompson, a spokesman for the hospital, rejected that charge.</p>
        <p>''It's not a ruse,'' he said. ''Many feel it's preferable to Plan A.''</p>
        <p>And yet it is clear that the hospital favors the retail project.</p>
        <p>''We believe this is a well-reasoned plan, one that takes many points of view into consideration,'' said Connie Hildesley, the hospital's vice president for real estate. ''With this plan, we create a park and permanent open space for the residents of White Plains, new revenue sources for the city and supplemental income and a stable future for the hospital.''</p>
        <p>She said the hospital envisions ''high-end retail'' shops and no ''big box'' retailers.</p>
        <p>The commercial value of the land is substantial, said Chris O'Callahan, a partner at the McCarthy O'Callahan Company, a White Plains real estate company. ''The land is very valuable because it is at the confluence of all the major roads in the county,'' he said. ''So the access to the property is tremendous. There's a history of high-end retail development there: it would be very, very desirable.''</p>
        <p>Harold E. Vogt, president of the county Chamber of Commerce who supports the retail development plan, said it would not harm other retail areas of the city. But opponents see things differently.</p>
        <p>Marc Pollitzer, president of the North Street Civic Association, said, ''You're talking about commercial sprawl into pristine residential communities.'' He said that while the group supported limited commercial development, it would ''like to see a more meaningful area of property'' set aside for open space.</p>
        <p>Alan Teck, president of Concerned Citizens for Open Space, a group formed in the early 1980's to oppose the hospital's 1983 plan for development, said his organization of about 600 residents wanted to see the hospital develop medical facilities on its own campus ''and sell at least 100 acres of their property'' to a land trust.</p>
        <p>Councilman Benjamin Boykin called the retail development ''massive'' and in conflict with the city's 1997 comprehensive plan. He said he would have liked a ''scaled down'' version of the retail plan. He added that through negotiations he thought a compromise could be reached with less commercial space and a 100- acre park. Councilwoman Pauline Oliva agreed.</p>
        <p>But the hospital has rejected such an approach.</p>
        <p>''There has to be sufficient development on what is not park to make it economically viable for the hospital to give up the parkland,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''We need to get some critical mass on the rest of it.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Joseph M. Delfino supports the retail plan and fears losing the park, as does Councilman Robert Greer, who favors at least referring Plan A to other city agencies.</p>
        <p>''I view the recommendations for commercial and residential development as the price the city might have to pay for a park,'' Mr. Greer said., arguing that meaningful discussion was needed rather than two sides ''threatening each other with total annihilation.''</p>
        <p>He said he feared that ''if we turn the referral down, the hospital is going to sit down and go with Plan B.''</p>
