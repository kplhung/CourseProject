        <p>STEFAN KANFER, the author of the new biography ''Groucho: The Life and Times of Julius Henry Marx'' (Alfred A. Knopf), was Time magazine's film and theater critic in the late 1960's, and he met Marx on several occasions.</p>
        <p>In addition to being intelligent and sharpwitted, sometimes obnoxiously so, Mr. Kanfer said, Marx could, at times, ''be sweet and very gallant.'' Once, Mr. Kanfer, 65, recalled: ''My wife, May, and I got into an elevator with Groucho in New York City, and he looked at us and said loudly, 'Why is it that writers always have such pretty wives?' That was one of his lines, of course, but women were always charmed by him from that moment on.</p>
        <p>''Groucho loved being in the company of writers. If I was an actor, he wouldn't have given me seven seconds of his time. As it was, whenever I saw him all I would want to talk to him about was 'Duck Soup,' and all he would want to talk about was Somerset Maugham.''</p>
        <p>The Kanfers have lived in Hastings-on-Hudson for 29 years. Here are excerpts from a recent interview:</p>
        <p>Q. Were you a big Groucho Marx and Marx Brothers fan as a child?</p>
        <p>A. Yes. My parents took me when I was about 9 to a Museum of Modern Art Marx Brothers film festival, and in the middle of one of the movies I saw Groucho turn to the camera and say, ''I have to stay here -- you can go out to the lobby and get some popcorn.'' And I thought, he's talking to me!</p>
        <p>All three of the Marx Brothers had the look of immigrants, and since my grandfather had been an immigrant, there was something endearing to me about them. I didn't find them threatening or mean. I thought they were enchanting.</p>
        <p>Q. How long did it take you to write your biography of Groucho Marx?</p>
        <p>A. The wise guy answer is ''all my life.'' The truth is that it took about a year of research and then about another year of writing. The problem with this book was that, ideally, you want to do a lot of interviewing of family members and friends, but when I started to talk to people who knew Groucho well, they were so old that they'd often tell the same story five or six times.</p>
        <p>Q. Is Groucho's humor too insulting for today's sensitive, politically correct times?</p>
        <p>A. Probably -- that is to say, it couldn't happen now. If you look at it in context, yes, Groucho's being mean to the high society woman whom Margaret Dumont portrays in the Marx Brothers movies. It's a generous humor, though, and it's supposed to be taken as a representation of real life. But today I don't think you could kick a society woman around like he did, or do an Italian accent either or pretend to be dumb.</p>
        <p>Q. What areas in life here in Westchester would be ripe for Groucho's rapier wit?</p>
        <p>A. I taught at Purchase College in the late 1980's, and I found that the administration there was right out of ''Horsefeathers.'' They're gone now, so my comments aren't libelous. They were foolish. It's no secret that it's an ugly campus; they could spend a couple of hundred grand on landscaping and architecture. Groucho, I think, would have had a field day at that kind of place, as he did in ''Horsefeathers,'' just watching people take themselves too seriously.</p>
        <p>I also think politics today is ripe for a Groucho kind of approach. The hate, the rigidity, the way everything depends on a sound bite -- he would have had an absolutely wonderful time on the hustings. He would have had fun with commuting, too, which I don't think the Marx Brothers ever ''did.'' The art and science of commuting; the people who have a silent agreement not to talk with each other in the morning as they try to get themselves together to go to work; and the people who are getting out their laptop computers on the train. Anything physical, like working on a laptop, you can be sure they'd focus on that.</p>
        <p>Q. Have you experienced Marxian moments of madness and mirth here in Westchester?</p>
        <p>A. All the time. While walking into a restaurant one day I heard someone say, ''And it happened right in the middle of vicuna season.'' What happened? Was this person a furrier? This is one of those absurd things that, when you think about it, could be part of a Marx Brothers movie.</p>
        <p>Q. In the course of writing ''Groucho'' did you find anything deplorable in his character or deeds?</p>
        <p>A. I wouldn't say deplorable, but there was a sadness, as there is to many comics' lives. Most comedians don't have lyrical home lives because they take their work home with them. Groucho often made his wives -- and I emphasize the word wives -- the butt of his jokes. He used to kid, if that's the word, his first wife when she served dinner by saying, ''Oh, concentration camp fare again!'' All three of his wives, in one degree or another, were substance abusers, and I think he probably saw in them some weakness he could expose -- certainly not the nicest aspect of anyone's character. And he had trouble with his kids. When they were small, everything was wonderful. As he got older, Arthur, Groucho's son, became something of a rival; he was a writer, and they once had a terrible argument over who had a Broadway show last the longest. The middle child, Miriam, became an alcoholic and only quit drinking two months before Groucho died in 1977. His youngest daughter, Melinda, was pushed into show business by Groucho, which she resented.</p>
        <p>Q. You have a Groucho-esque mustache. How long have you had it?</p>
        <p>A. About 10 years, and growing it had nothing to do with Groucho. Some guys have David Niven-like mustaches, and it's been my curse to have a Groucho mustache.</p>
