        <p>Jill Enfield/Jay Hoops  Beacon Gallery, 112 South Country Road, Bellport. Through July 30. (631) 286-6363.</p>
        <p>Under the collective title ''Italian Traces,'' Ms. Enfield has printed photographs of building and landscape details on eight-inch-square ceramic tiles. Some are composed of several tiles, while others fill a single square. The artist's aim was to bring her images ''to an architectural state,'' especially in relation to the weathered brick and stone walls of her Tuscan subject matter.</p>
        <p>She is successful to a degree, but the tiles themselves somewhat undermine the effect. They are very smooth commercial ware, with crisp edges and exact angles, quite unlike the buildings Ms. Enfield depicts.  Nor do they seem especially architectural; they look more like neutral floor or wall finishes adaptable to any building, old or modern. Their outstanding characteristic is their strict squareness. When grouped, these components create a grid that imposes order on the eccentric stucco walls and pock-marked stonework of ancient structures, contrasting rather than harmonizing with them.  Only in ''Siena Windows,'' with its regular rectangular pattern of uniformly shuttered windows, is there a complementary give and take between subject and medium. Ms. Enfield's references to solidity and timelessness might have been just as well served in conventional photographs on high-quality paper.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hoops, on the other hand, is more interested in impermanence, shifting perceptions and a feeling of intangible experience. Her computer-enhanced photographs are grouped into series dealing with aspects of light, water, mist and marsh, although some of her sensuous images might easily fit into more than one of those categories.</p>
        <p>With the slightly unnatural aura of hand-colored photographs, these landscapes have a dream-like quality that straddles the border between real and surreal. In fact, they are mostly montages created in the machine, using interactive textures and tones. ''Transition'' superimposes a pair of desolate bushes on a wood-grain texture that approximates a windswept sky, but not so perfectly that one doesn't pause to question what it really is. Nor is color left in its natural state. In ''Blazing Bush,'' for example, certain areas are intensified, as if a selective light had been trained on them, while others are played down. The overall effect is haunting and subtle, and it works much better without glass between image and viewer. Look at the unframed prints in portfolios to get a fuller appreciation of their tonal richness and delicate detail.</p>
        <p>Outdoor Sculpture Show  John T. Mather Memorial Hospital, 75 North Country Road, Port Jefferson. Through Aug. 31. (631) 476-2723.</p>
        <p>As has become traditional in this large outdoor display, which this year includes work by 27 sculptors, the selection offers something for everyone, whether abstract or representational, geometric or organic, serious or humorous.</p>
        <p>Fans of the fantastic will enjoy Steve Zaluski's ''Flaming Flower,'' with its baroque arabesques and glossy metallic colors. In ''Ask Alice,'' Pauli Suominen transforms castoff gas canisters into a giant centipede with polka-dot accents, apparently a result of an encounter with a Wonderland ''drink me'' potion.</p>
        <p>James Cook comments on the superficiality of fashion in ''The Facade of Glamour,'' in which a pair of mannequins keep up appearances with the help of a small army of image enhancers. At the opposite extreme, Thomas Lendavi strips away surface illusion in an untitled arrangement of I-beams emerging from the lawn, setting up a nice contrast between the regularity of industrial metal and the natural pattern of the surrounding grass.</p>
        <p>Arthur Bernhang also starts with pieces of scrap metal, which he reconfigures as forms resembling bells and gongs. In ''Tocsin,'' he has fashioned a pendulum-like structure that swings slightly within its framework.  The wind also animates Mr. Zaluski's ''Blue Cube,'' with the hard-edged cube mounted in a bright red arc that seems about to swallow it.</p>
        <p>Like the sculptures of Chris Burton, to which its title alludes, Kirk McCoy's '''Burtonesque Seating,'' a group of tapered oak uprights, can be appreciated as pure abstract forms or as functional outdoor furniture.</p>
        <p>Similarly, an untitled piece by Pamela Brown, with its pod-like central element held aloft on a graceful pedestal of iron rods, looks like a model of a rocket launcher or a counterpoint of closed and open curves.</p>
        <p>'Ship to Shore'  Art Museum, the Museums at Stony Brook, 1208 Route 25A, Stony Brook. Through Aug. 6. (631) 751-0066.</p>
        <p>Perhaps out of longing for distant seas, the Butler family of Youngstown, Ohio, assembled a major collection of marine paintings that is now housed in the Butler Institute of American Art. This traveling exhibition includes 66 examples from the Butlers' collection, ranging from formal mid-19th century portraits of sailing vessels to coastal scenes painted in the 1980's, from busy urban ports to deserted waters in unspoiled locales.</p>
        <p>The first gallery is devoted to ship portraits, a popular genre in the era of developing international maritime commerce, both under sail and steam powered. Proud owners commissioned detailed likenesses of their vessels from James E. Buttersworth, Thomas Birch, Samuel Walters, Duncan McFarlane and a host of lesser-known or anonymous painters. A personal favorite here is McFarlane's ''Alice Couce,'' in which the magnificent ship is foiled against an ominously rocky coast. In the foreground, the end of a spar just breaks the water's surface, hinting at a wreck below.</p>
        <p>Several works focus on the beauties of treacherous coastal waters, like Harrison Brown's mist-shrouded ''Grand Manan Island,'' in the Bay of Fundy. Even more dramatically, in ''Land's End, Cornwall,'' William Trost Richards fills a huge canvas with seemingly endless cliffs, dashed by breakers and blanketed in fog, that promise only danger to an approaching vessel.</p>
        <p>Safe harbor is represented by ''The Landing, Bailey Island, Maine,'' by Alfred T. Bricher, where fishing boats tie up in a placid bay, and John Whorf's ''Scene in Barbados,'' with children playing around the colorful beached boats.</p>
        <p>Whorf is not alone in picturing the shore as a place for recreation. Augustus Vincent Tack's impressionistic ''Seaside Scene'' is a charming study of a young woman strolling along a bluff, from which she watches pleasure craft out for a sail.</p>
        <p>George Grosz inserted an amusing trompe l'oeil element in ''Resting,'' in which a lion-shaped sand dune, complete with grassy mane, looks about to pounce on the plump morsel who sunbathes in an isolated hideaway.</p>
