        <p>The Newark Museum and the New Jersey Performing Arts Center were each awarded a $1 million grants by the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation in honor of the foundation's 25th anniversary. Unlike most grants, the money was given without an application process and can be used for general operating expenses. Similar grants will be awarded in the future, according to David Grant, foundation executive director.</p>
        <p>''The grants to the two Newark cultural organizations will add to the momentum of the city's renaissance,'' said John Yingling, the foundation's chief financial officer.</p>

        <p>''The grants to the two Newark cultural organizations will add to the momentum of the city's renaissance,'' said John Yingling, the foundation's chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>The money will allow the Newark Museum to reinstall its American art collection sooner than previously planned and will also be used for exhibitions focusing on Latino cultures. At the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the money will be used to support core programs like arts education and the World Festival, which focuses on international culture and its local impact.</p>
