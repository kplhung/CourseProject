        <p>County organizations have received $4.8 million in state grants for four projects that will create housing for the elderly and help first-time home buyers buy homes.</p>
        <p>In Yorktown, Landmark Partners is receiving $1.8 million to provide 64 units of housing for the elderly in a project called Wynwood Oaks. The development team consists of Landmark Partners, the contractor, the Westchester Interfaith Housing Corporation and the architect, Anthony J. Coppolla.</p>
        <p>The apartments will be available to households with incomes below 60 percent of the county's median income -- $79,900 for a family of four  -- with one-bedroom units renting for $440 to $840 a month.</p>
        <p>In Mount Vernon, Community Gardens is receiving $2.6 million to build 54 one-bedroom units for the elderly. The development consists of Community Gardens, Mountco Construction and Development Company and the architect, Swanke Hayden Connell. Monthly rents will range from $365 to $672 for households with incomes below 50 percent of the area's median income.</p>
        <p>In White Plains, $50,000 will be used to provide emergency home repairs to low-income elderly homeowners, with a maximum of $5,000 for owners with incomes up to 60 percent of the median income. The city is the municipal sponsor there.</p>
        <p>And in a countywide program, Community Housing Innovations will receive $400,000 to help low-income residents buy homes. An average of $16,000 a unit will be awarded to households with incomes at or below 80 percent of the median income.</p>
        <p>Statewide, $80.4 million in housing development projects and programs was approved under the state's Low Income Housing Trust Fund ($28 million), the state's Home program ($31 million), Low Income Housing Credit ($20 million) and the Restore Program ($1.43 million).</p>
        <p>Officials said the awards statewide would provide more than $267 million in additional public and private investment and give local governments, nonprofit organizations and developers with the resources -- including Federal tax credits -- needed to make thousands of affordable housing units available.</p>
        <p>In some cases, Federal tax credits over 10 years will be offered to nonprofit organizations to help developers obtain financing, said Judy Calogero, deputy commissioner for the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal. ''Many developers don't go out for low-income housing, because traditionally they don't get as high a return on their investment,'' she said.</p>
