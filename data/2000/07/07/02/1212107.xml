        <p>The spirited waterfront city of Portland, Me., has quietly emerged from the shadows in the past few years. Residents these days don't need to explain to visitors quite so often that, well, the Trail Blazers play basketball in that other Portland. Two decades ago entrepreneurs reinvigorated the Victorian Old Port neighborhood, known for its exceptional brick architecture. The revival recently moved uptown to Congress Street, where an arts district is taking root, helped by the Maine College of Art's decision to fill an empty Beaux-Arts department store with students after its owners decamped to a mall.</p>
        <p>On the streets this summer you're likely to overhear Portlanders talking of soaring real estate values and of Web entrepreneurs who have started to trickle in. Portland, Maine's largest city, once had easy access to European trade routes in its favor; now it has lifestyle. Situated on Casco Bay, which is often speckled with colorful sailboats on summer weekends, it's a tidy and compact city, where you can walk almost everywhere. Yet it's imbued with far more urban energy than one would expect for a city of 65,000.</p>
        <p>The optimism is sometimes tinged with nervousness. Portlanders have been comfortable in the shadows, thank you very much, and there's growing concern that too much attention will bring unwelcome change.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>This month Portland's harbor will take on a 19th-century air when more than two dozen tall ships from around the world will converge here, the final port in Operation Sail 2000, (207) 541-7400, which began in Puerto Rico in May. The Portland festivities begin with a ship parade at noon on July 28, when the tall ships will be greeted with gun salutes as they pass sites of two 19th-century forts.</p>
        <p>Among the best vantage points is the pathway along the Eastern Prom, which runs northward along the harbor from near the Casco Bay Lines ferry terminal. The three-day event will also include fireworks, musical performances at stages along the waterfront, ship tours, and maritime exhibits at museums in and around the city.</p>
        <p>The Yarmouth Clam Festival, (207) 846-3984, takes place July 21 to 23 in the village of Yarmouth, about 15 minutes' drive north of Portland. It's an old-fashioned community festival, and this year will feature pageantry imported from the medieval festival in Cortona, Italy, including a crossbow contest and a parade with costumed performers, Carnival rides, old-fashioned games and splendidly caloric foods round out the event; admission is free.</p>
        <p>The Portland Museum of Art, 7 Congress Square, (800) 639-4067, is displaying more than 50 works by N. C. Wyeth, the patriarch of the Wyeth clan (1882-1945), through Oct. 15. Wyeth is best known for his vivid illustrations of books like ''Treasure Island,'' but he also painted privately, dabbling in styles ranging from Impressionism to Realism. The exhibition's emphasis is on the paintings, but a number of Wyeth's illustrations are also on view.</p>
        <p>The Center for Cultural Exchange, 1 Longfellow Square, (207) 761-1545, presents a series of global music concerts and dances each week throughout the summer. At 7 p.m. this Saturday the Saigon Water Puppets of Vietnam will perform at the center, to the accompaniment of music played on centuries-old instruments. Tickets are $10, $5 for children.</p>
        <p>The colorful Maine Festival, (207) 772-9012, runs from Aug. 4 to 6, with an eclectic assortment of Maine musicians, poets, dancers, artists and craftsmen. The sprawling festival attracts about 20,000 visitors during its three-day run at the Thomas Point Beach campground in Brunswick, at the north end of Casco Bay, 26 miles north of Portland. Tickets are $12 at the gate, $10 in advance, with discounts for seniors and children.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>A superb spot to get the lay of the land is atop the Portland Observatory, 138 Congress Street, (207) 774-5561, on Munjoy Hill, one of the downtown residential neighborhoods. The 86-foot cone-shaped tower was built in 1807 as a perch to notify Portlanders of incoming ships via a system of flags. It reopened on June 10 after a five-year renovation, and the observation deck offers a vertiginous view of the city, harbor and islands. Open daily; $3.</p>
        <p>The best way to tour Portland is on foot, for a better appreciation of the brick sidewalks, granite curbs, architectural details and the sound of gulls wheeling overhead. The Old Port district, home to dozens of boutiques and restaurants, has some fine examples of Victorian commercial architecture, most of them dating from after 1866, when the last great fire swept through the city. Greater Portland Landmarks, 165 State Street, (207) 774-5561, publishes self-guided walking tours of four neighborhoods, for $1.25 each. The organization also conducts daily guided walking tours, beginning at 10:30 a.m. and lasting for about an hour and a half, between July 5 and Oct. 9. The starting point for the tours is the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Greater Portland, 305 Commercial Street, (207) 772-5800.</p>
        <p>In the city's West End, one of Portland's grand 19th-century neighborhoods of architecturally eclectic houses, is the Morse-Libby House, 109 Danforth Street, (207) 772-4841, one of the nation's pre-eminent examples of Italianate Victorian architecture. Guided tours through this opulent brownstone mansion suggest a lavishness that might arouse envy in Donald Trump. The house is open Tuesday through Sunday; $7.</p>
        <p>Along the waterfront on Commercial Street, a fleet of sightseeing boats offers excursions through the dozens of islands that dot the bay. Among the more intriguing destinations is the 17-acre Eagle Island, the former summer home of the Arctic explorer Robert E. Peary. The four-hour trip includes an hour-and-20-minute stop on the island (take a picnic), where Peary's home, a 1904 shingle and stone summer cottage, is open to the public. Eagle Island Tours, Long Wharf, (207) 774-6498, offers one trip daily at 10 a.m., with reservations suggested. The price is $18, $10.50 for children.</p>
        <p>Fifteen minutes from downtown is the Portland Head Light, 1000 Shore Road, Cape Elizabeth; (207) 799-2661. It may look instantly familiar -- it appears frequently in calendars and ads. The light dates from 1791 (President George Washington appointed the first keeper), and the present lightkeeper's house, the third on the site, was built in 1891. The light is still operational and so isn't open to the public, but travelers can stroll the expansive park grounds overlooking the harbor's entrance and visit the museum at the keeper's house. The park is free; the museum, open daily, is $2, $1 for children.</p>
        <p>On sweltering days, visitors might opt for a trip 20 miles south to Old Orchard Beach, home to a seven-mile sandy strand edged by chilly ocean waters, carnival rides and food vendors.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>The stylishly funky Pomegranate Inn, 49 Neal Street, (207) 772-1006, fax (207) 773-4426, in the West End, was built in 1884. It has eight guest rooms, all above average in size, decorated with antiques, modern art and vibrantly painted walls. Doubles are $135 to $225, including breakfast.</p>
        <p>Barbara Hathaway has converted a regal 1821 brick house into the welcoming Danforth Inn, 163 Danforth Street; (207) 879-8755, fax (207) 879-8754. The 10 guest rooms vary in size (some are in the former servants' quarters), but all are comfortable and attractive. Room 1 has a private sitting room and second-floor deck; guests have access to the billiard room in the basement. Doubles are $135 to $285, including breakfast.</p>
        <p>Budget: The Percy Inn, 15 Pine Street, (207) 871-7638, fax (207) 775-2599, is in a narrow 1830 brick row house in the city's West End and has two guest rooms and three suites furnished in early Federal style. All rooms are up a steep winding staircase. Those facing the street are a bit noisy, but brighter and more spacious than those facing the rear. Doubles are $89 to $169, with breakfast.</p>
        <p>The Inn at Park Spring, 135 Spring Street, (800) 437-8511 or (207) 774-1059 has six guest rooms in a cozy 1835 brick house near the art museum and within strolling distance of the Old Port and city restaurants. Summer rates for two are $135 to $145, including breakfast.</p>
        <p>Luxury: About 15 minutes southeast of Portland is the Black Point Inn, 510 Black Point Road, Prouts Neck, Scarborough, (800) 258-0003, fax (207) 883-9976, a compound of shingled 19th-century buildings on nine acres overlooking the ocean. Built as a summer resort in 1873, the inn features 85 guest rooms in five buildings. Most rooms are in the main lodge, and are generous in size and furnished in a cheerful summer-cottage style. Summer rates from $345 for two, including breakfast and dinner.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Cravings for basic boiled lobster are probably better indulged elsewhere along the Maine coast, at rustic lobster shacks, at picnic tables atop a pier. In Portland, the fare is more creative.</p>
        <p>Natasha's, 40 Portland Street, (207) 774-4004, features new American fare in an echo-y industrial space, with a menu that features Thai noodles with vegetarian pot stickers, grilled pork loin with po blano jam, and ravioli stuffed with lobster and crab. Open Tuesday to Saturday for dinner, daily for breakfast and lunch. Dinner for two with wine, about $60.</p>
        <p>At Ribollita, 41 Middle Street, (207) 774-2972, Kevin Quiet, the chef and owner, offers a menu of handmade pasta and other Mediterranean-influenced dishes. Among the options: ravioli with white beans and Romano cheese served with a hazelnut brown butter, and oven-poached sole with crabmeat mascarpone tortellini. Open for dinner Tuesday to Saturday; dinner for two, with wine, is about $70.</p>
        <p>Bella Cucina, 653 Congress Street, (207) 828-4033, combines romantic and hip in a storefront restaurant that's awash in mellow tones. The restaurant bills its fare as country Italian, and serves up a good selection of fresh seafood and vegetarian options. The menu changes according to availability of ingredients; expect entrees like a grilled salmon medallion in a parmesan-hazelnut crust, or a rabbit, duck and pork ragu served over pasta with wood-grilled peppers. Open nightly; dinner $75 for two, with wine.</p>
        <p>The informal and eclectic Katahdin, 106 High Street, (207) 774-1740, is near the art museum and offers budget blue-plate specials along with more refined fare. The seafood is particularly good, with dishes ranging from yellowfin tuna with a green onion wasabi sauce to grilled sea scallops. The bar has been mixing martinis since well before the martini bar was rediscovered. Open nightly, Tuesday through Saturday; dinner for two, with martinis: $75.</p>
        <p>Silly's, 40 Washington Avenue, (207) 772-0360, will satisfy aficionados of kitsch (especially Elvis kitsch) and zesty finger food. It's a boisterous neighborhood joint; the pizzas are popular, as are the lamb shish kebab roll-ups with feta cheese. Hand-cut fries and a milkshake nicely fill out a meal, not to mention the customer. Open daily except Sunday for lunch and dinner: about $15 to $20 for two.</p>
