        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his effort to connect Sleater-Kinney with the heroes of his youth (Bob Dylan, John Fogerty, the Chantels?), Greil Marcus plays down what's most original about the band: that three women who write uncompromising songs, manage their own business and eschew the big labels can still draw a crowd of 10,000. I doubt if sound can change the world -- Mr. Marcus's idols dispelled that myth post-Woodstock -- but the band's do-it-yourself approach to its art might help with the more modest goal of changing people's minds about what's possible outside the mainstream of media and rock-crit hype. I suspect that many of the ''riotously tattooed crowd'' in Dolores Park got that before the band played a note.</p>
