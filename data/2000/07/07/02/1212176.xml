        <p>SERIOUS fun is the leitmotif throughout Norfolk Chamber Music Festival in the northwest corner of the state. Serious denotes the caliber of the musicians, from the Tokyo String Quartet to the guitarist Eliot Fisk and the Yale School of Music faculty in residence. Serious might also be applied to the choice of composers: Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Copland.</p>
        <p>And fun refers to the ingenious programming of Joan Panetti -- the pianist, composer and Yale faculty member who has been director of the festival (which has also served as the Yale School of Music's summer session) since 1981 -- and who can tear up Beethoven or play a tango with a long-stemmed red rose between her teeth.</p>

        <p>SERIOUS fun is the leitmotif throughout Norfolk Chamber Music Festival in the northwest corner of the state. Serious denotes the caliber of the musicians, from the Tokyo String Quartet to the guitarist Eliot Fisk and the Yale School of Music faculty in residence. Serious might also be applied to the choice of composers: Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Copland.</p>
        <p>And fun refers to the ingenious programming of Joan Panetti -- the pianist, composer and Yale faculty member who has been director of the festival (which has also served as the Yale School of Music's summer session) since 1981 -- and who can tear up Beethoven or play a tango with a long-stemmed red rose between her teeth.</p>
        <p>Jazz, ballroom dancing and silent movies are among other attractions during the season, which takes place on the Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate with 70 acres of lawn, gardens and elegant buildings in the village of Norfolk.</p>
        <p>The summer school has attracted young ensembles from all over the world who audition for the chance to study the art of chamber music. Many of the successful auditioners, known as fellows, go on to win major awards, recording contracts and pursue distinguished careers. (Recitals by these students are given Thursdays and Saturday mornings.) The festival also offers concerts by the faculty and visiting artists who coach the fellows on Friday and Saturday evenings.</p>
        <p>Concerts are given in the acoustically superb Music Shed, built in 1906 of cedar and redwood. The musical lineage of Norfolk includes such luminaries as Sergei Rachmaninoff, Enrico Caruso and Fritz Kreisler. Jean Sibelius composed and conducted the premiere of his tone poem ''The Oceanides'' in the summer of 1914. Other composers who have seen their works first performed in Norfolk include Horatio Parker, Percy Granger and Ralph Vaughan Williams. The spirit and tradition of composition continues to this day.</p>
        <p>Two weeks before the festival's official opening, Ms. Panetti conducts a contemporary music workshop. Six of today's most promising young composers (from 90 applicants) have been selected to create new works for the festival and, for this year in particular, the popular contemporary classic music ensemble known as Eighth Blackbird. In an organic process of composition and performance, composers and musicians will evolve the pieces together. The culmination is Norfolk's opening concert on Friday at 8 p.m. in the Music Shed, which will feature Eighth Blackbird.</p>
        <p>''This group is phenomenal,'' said the perennially enthusiastic Ms. Panetti in a telephone conversation from her office at Yale. ''They are Norfolk alumni,'' she said, ''and they have walked off with many prestigious prizes, such as the Naumburg Award and the Concert Artists Guild International Competition.'' The concert's program will feature world premieres by Kenneth Eberhard, Suzanne Farrin, Chia-Yu Hsu, John Kaefer, Michael Spassov, Daniel Kellogg and Kevin Putz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putz is a Yale alumnus who has commissions from the Boston Pops, the Utah and Cincinnati symphonies (planned for a premiere at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City), among numerous others. ''I am making a living at this, it's hard to believe,'' said the 28-year old composer over the phone from Austin, Tex. where he is on the music faculty of the University of Texas. He said that for the past year he has used a software program called Sibelius that saves him a lot of time in hand-copying composition manuscripts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putz said he was looking forward to returning to Norfolk and to working with Eighth Blackbird, which will perform his new work  called ''Obsessive Nature.'' ''They are so hot right now,'' he said. ''Everybody knows about them. I think it's wonderful to be able to work with people the same age.''</p>
        <p>Eighth Blackbird -- whose name comes from Wallace Stevens's poem ''Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird'' -- got together four years ago when the members of the touring sextet were students at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. The group gave a buoyant concert in the Music Shed upon their arrival in Norfolk on a recent Sunday afternoon. For the concert (aimed at children in the company of adults), the group performed a version of Cinderella in which Cindy got a makeover from a fairy godfather and went to the dance in a silver Porsche.</p>
        <p>Adults and children responded with great enthusiasm to the sextet's up-to-the-minute modern performance. ''We want to see people enjoying themselves,'' said Nicholas Photinos, the group's cellist. Matt Albert, the violinist, agreed, adding, ''We're not doing this because we feel some need to defend contemporary music. We enjoy it.''</p>
        <p>Among highlights of the season, which will conclude on Aug. 26 with a performance by the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio, is the return of the Tokyo String Quartet as well as the Vermeer Quartet. A Bach weekend will run through the Brandenberg Concertos, selected cantatas and more. The festival's jazz tradition continues with the Barbara Carroll Duo and Aaron Coplands 100th birthday will be celebrated. The Music Shed will be transformed into a ballroom for a program on Aug. 19 when the New World Jazz Orchestra plays to an audience at cafe tables. And Nexus, a percussion theater ensemble, offers new American works, African drumming improvisations and ragtime selections.</p>
        <p>The Norfolk Chamber Music Festival runs from Friday through Aug. 26. Tickets are $12 to $30, $5 for adults from 18 to 25, children free. The number to call for more information is (860) 542-3000 or visit the Web site, www.yale.edu/norfolk.</p>
