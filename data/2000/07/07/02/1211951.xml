        <p>Before the start, 66-year-old Bill Lenderking said he wondered if he had ''the right stuff'' to keep up with the four younger and more experienced rowers. He felt the old-school dread of letting the side down and a more recent fear of discovering he really was as old as his reflection in other people's eyes.</p>
        <p>Would he shame himself and slump over his oars, unable to continue, or, even worse, be humiliated by his companions' indulgence? Of course, they would wait for him to catch up; the four-day, 100-mile trip from South Street Seaport Museum to Shelter Island had been his idea.</p>
        <p>The youngest and most experienced of the five, the wiry, cool David Stookey, 57,  doubted at the start that Lenderking would make it. He did not appear especially fit or muscular, and he had not rowed since childhood. His greatest strength, an almost childlike enthusiasm, seemed to desert him as the four boats pulled out of the slip at the foot of John Street into the East River. Lenderking was already falling behind, jerking his oars in a ragged rhythm. God help him at Hell Gate.</p>
        <p>Three people came to see them off at 10:30 a.m. last Monday. Chelsea Danburg, 26, one of Louis Mackall's four daughters, brought her husband, Asher, to support her dad's sustaining passion. For the past 12 years, Mackall, a 59-year-old architect from Branford, Conn., has rowed nearly every day, summer and winter, before work.</p>
        <p>''My theory is that the body is happy only when it gets a lot of exercise,'' said Mackall. ''We need much more exercise than we get. If I was a therapist, I'd tell my patients, 'Go run 20 miles, then come back and we'll talk.' ''</p>
        <p>The third waver from the shore was Robert Ruenitz, a former Foreign Service colleague of Lenderking's who had been surprised when he read about the proposed trip; he knew Lenderking had trekked and scuba-dived during overseas assignments, but he had never heard about rowing. No wonder, he agreed, watching him awkwardly yanking under a boiling sun, trying to get out before The Beast, a huge tourist boat with a wake as terrifying as a perfect storm, came churning in. As the four boats turned left and headed north, Mackall yodeling in the lead, Lenderking already trailing by several lengths, Ruenitz sighed and said, ''A gallant band.''</p>
        <p>They were not a band yet. They barely knew each other.</p>
        <p>Lenderking, who had sentimental memories of boyhood rows off Shelter Island, where he recently bought a house, conceived the trip as a test. For all his endearing, lanky gawkiness, there is something steely and calculating about Lenderking. It is not hard to envision him as a propagandist for the government's Vietnam pacification program. But ever since he was pensioned off five years ago at 61, Lenderking has struggled to chart a new course in a world skewed to the young. He sensed a metaphor in rowing out of the discard pool.</p>
        <p>Several months ago, he called a longtime friend, Stookey, a management consultant who also publishes a newsletter, ''Open-Water Rowing.'' Stookey thought the cruise, as he called it, was ''do-able.'' He called one of his 800 readers, 58-year-old John Mullen, a Dallas architect and businessman whom he had once met briefly at a race. Mullen has won a number of masters sculling championships, but, like the others, had never rowed more than 20 miles in a day, and then for only one day at a time.</p>
        <p>But Mullen called his summer rowing partner, Mackall, who recruited his neighbor, 60-year-old Tom Luckey, an architect who designs children's playground climbing structures. Luckey had never rowed before but was in good shape and willing to train for rowing a two-man boat. The men began an e-mail circle of questions, training tips and bios. None of the men considered themselves jocks, although Lenderking ran track at Dartmouth, Mackall played ice hockey at Yale, Luckey is a swimmer, Mullen, who is 6 feet 7 inches, played freshman basketball at Rice, and Stookey once sailed solo across the Atlantic in a race. They became cyberbuds.</p>
        <p>As the notion became a high concept, Lenderking drove from his home in Washington to Ontario to buy a 17-foot Loudon fiberglass boat for $2,200. He named it Up the Creek. And then, in an act that they all admit raised the ante, Lenderking, without consulting the others, called to see if I was interested. We had never met. I was mildly interested, I said, being in their age group.</p>
        <p>But after I wrote about the plan-in-progress (''It gives new meaning to the word 'cockamamie,' '' Mackall would say later), thelipsite@aol.com received more than 100 e-mails requesting the trip be covered. The e-mailers tended to be upper-middle class, middle-aged men engaged by Mullen's reason for rowing -- ''I'm at an age when I'm looking for stretches.''</p>
        <p>For the first two hours, despite unexpectedly smooth conditions (the East River turned out to be cleaner than much of Long Island Sound, which was a millpond), it seemed far more than a stretch for Lenderking. He would say later that he never for a moment doubted he would finish, but as he frequently rested from his flailing strokes, the others' concern mounted.</p>
        <p>''Actually,'' said Luckey, a whimsical man with a spacey delivery, ''I was hoping Bill would give me an excuse. Mackall has these annoying bursts of energy.''</p>
        <p>But sometime after the surprisingly pacific Hell Gate, Lenderking found his rhythm. The long, ropy arms on his 6-4 body became an extension of the oars. Up the Creek began to move smoothly into the brown waters of the Sound. Stookey stayed with Lenderking and they pulled into Bayville a half-hour behind the other two boats. Exhausted, the five men lugged the four boats across a highway to a motel, ate and fell asleep.</p>
        <p>They all felt better in the morning, astonished at their lack of stiffness. Mullen said his back had ached more in training. On the second day, they pulled with a favorable tide, screamed and laughed through a brief thunderstorm that, according to Mackall, turned the surface of the water into ''vibrating marbles.''</p>
        <p>Mackall (''He is a bull,'' said Luckey) was pulling more than his weight in a 17-foot Monument River wherry he had bought used for $1,500 last winter. The boat had won a number of races, but with the two men's gear and food it looked like a floating slum.</p>
        <p>''This is so exciting,'' Mackall said. ''I feel like a kid again on an adventure with the guys. I brought Luckey along because he talks endlessly, but we have run out of interesting things to say. We are into fantasies now.''</p>
        <p>The fantasists stopped once at a private beach in Sands Point for a quick swim; the owners of the mansion were not at home and the workmen didn't care. Mullen did not swim; raised water-skiing on Texas lakes, he says he is still not used to salt water drying on his body. With Mullen, they pulled into Mount Sinai Yacht Club near Port Jefferson at about 4:30 p.m., after seven hours of rowing. Lenderking and Stookey, caught in a tide shift, arrived three hours later. They ate pizza and drank beer on the yacht club deck, then all slept on a sailboat, Daydreamer, courtesy of a yachtsman they knew only as Wayne.</p>
        <p>On the phone that night, Mackall said he was amazed by Lenderking. He added: ''The guy is smiling. He's getting stronger.''</p>
        <p>On the third morning, Stookey took off a half hour ahead of the others. Because his boat was the slowest, he said. He dismissed Lenderking's suspicion that he was really trying to avoid another long day of baby-sitting Up the Creek.</p>
        <p>A trim, tightly knit man with curly dark-blond hair, blue eyes and a sharp, sun-weathered face, Stookey is self-contained, almost mysterious, genial yet watchful. He has done most of his rowing alone, often testing boats for his newsletter and Web site (www.openwater.com). Manufactured by a French firm, Birus, his boat was a self-bailing, white 14-foot fiberglass yole with a sliding seat.</p>
        <p>Stookey hugged the shore on the third day, stopping several times to examine geological formations and to bird-watch. Maybe that's why the others never noticed that they were passing him. Mullen was Lenderking's ''escort'' that day, and Mullen likes to row a mile out to sea. The Mackall/ Luckey fantasies were particularly absorbing. (''Babes on the beach'' was all they would reveal later.) At 4:30, when they pulled into the Matt-A-Mar Marina in Mattituck, which charged them $20 each a night to tie up, Stookey was nowhere to be seen.</p>
        <p>''Maybe he just found people he likes better than us,'' Mackall said.</p>
        <p>''There's a whacked-out side to him,'' Luckey said. ''He's up to something. We'll see him tomorrow. He'll just row out to meet us.''</p>
        <p>But Mullen, the tall straight-arrow from Texas, fretted all the way back to the motel and while the others showered, he called other marinas on his cell phone. He was faintly annoyed that Stookey was not carrying a cell phone or a VHF radio or a global positioning system, as he was.</p>
        <p>At 7:45, about to go for dinner, Mullen insisted they all go down to the dock for one more look. It was Lenderking who shouted, ''The drama is over.''</p>
        <p>There was Stookey, cool and smiling, changing his shirt. He had reached the inlet hours ago, assumed he was still in the lead, parked the boat and fallen asleep on the rocks.</p>
        <p>He was only one who did not drink at dinner.</p>
        <p>The next morning, they hitched a ride on a garbage truck back to the marina. Mullen had wanted to row around Orient Point as part of his grand scheme of circling Long Island in stages. But the others were ''smelling the barn,'' as Mullen put it, and so they compromised on a portage through Truman Beach near East Marion.</p>
        <p>Mullen was amazed at how jaunty everyone was, how much lighter the boats seemed on the fourth day than the first. They were all so much stronger, surer.</p>
        <p>''The whole trip was much easier than I thought it would be,'' he said. ''You wonder how many things in life you don't try because the idea seems too big, too intimidating. I stayed up nights worrying about Hell Gate, and it was nothing.</p>
        <p>''I would never have tried this without Bill, and I've rowed for years and he never rowed before. I'm grateful to him and I'm amazed by his indomitability.''</p>
        <p>Mullen seemed to get the most pleasure from his boat, the fastest of the four, a beautiful, wooden, 18-foot St. Lawrence River skiff, a copy of a 19th-century boat in Mystic Seaport called Annie.</p>
        <p>''When you row you blow out your pipes,'' he said. ''There's a freshness, a different set of ideas out there. Clouds, water, your body, it's not a place to ponder changes in your life. It's a place to just plug into the environment we are usually isolated from.''</p>
        <p>The last day for the gallant band was the mellowest. They rowed at their usual 4 knots, but they arrived unusually close together, atypically on schedule, at about 4:30 p.m. They pulled up onto a private lawn on Gardiner's Creek in Shelter Island. It was suspicious that Lenderking was in the lead, but he seemed as fresh as the rest of them. His grin was certainly the widest. He echoed the consensus: The trip had been hard and senseless, and more fun than any of them had had since boyhood.</p>
        <p>The welcoming committee was smaller than the bon voyage entourage. Mullen's wife of 35 years, Anne, and their dog, Lover, were waiting on the lawn. Plans were made for a victory feast the next night at Mullen's house in Springs, East Hampton. Stookey was returning to Manhattan to pick up his car, then drive back to pick up his boat for the trip home to Rhode Island. It sounded harder than the row. Mullen, Mackall and Luckey would return in the morning to row to Springs and Amagansett.</p>
        <p>''And now,'' said Luckey, ''my wife, Ettie, will ask me again to explain why I am doing this, and I will tell her again I still hope to find out.''</p>
        <p>''So this is an existential search,'' said Lenderking, as if he was considering the trip for the very first time.</p>
        <p>''This is about life,'' said Luckey, striking a pose on the lawn. ''People die because they get out of the stream. The body senses you are not having a good time and says, 'That's it, buddy, we're out of here.' ''</p>
        <p>''And what we just did,'' asked Mullen, ''was in the stream?''</p>
        <p>''Oh, yeah,'' said Luckey, ''this was the stream.''</p>
