        <p>From Burlington to Brattleboro, with public hoopla or private solemnity, a scattering of gay couples across Vermont became the first in the country today to legally take on all the rights and responsibilities of marriage, in the first state to let them.</p>
        <p>On this, the day that Vermont's new law creating marriagelike civil unions officially came into effect, most town clerks were closed for the weekend, so there could be no broad rush to the almost-altar.</p>
        <p>But a handful of clerks opened their offices in response to requests from gay couples, very roughly estimated at perhaps two dozen, from both in and out of state, who wanted to pay their $20 fee, sign their certificates and get all-but-married the moment they could after years of unofficial union.</p>
        <p>For Lois Farnham and Holly Puterbaugh, who have been together nearly 28 years and were plaintiffs in a 1997 suit against the state that led to the civil unions law, such a moment was once so unimaginable that they had a soloist sing ''The Impossible Dream'' at their church ceremony before about 200 guests today.</p>
        <p>''Twenty-seven and a half years, that's a long engagement,'' Ms. Farnham said at the South Burlington municipal office, where the couple received their license and a wet-eyed hug from the city clerk, Margaret Picard. ''It's nice after all this time to say Holly's my spouse.''</p>
        <p>In Brattleboro, Carolyn Conrad, 29, and Kathleen Peterson, 41, were so eager to get ''C.U.-ed'' that they went  to the town clerk's office at midnight and filled out the paperwork. Witnessed by a cheering crowd of about 100 and a handful of protesters, they exchanged vows minutes later before a justice of the peace, making them the first in the country to be civilly united (or ''civilly unionized,'' or ''unified,'' or maybe ''civilized'' -- there is still some confusion here over verbs, couples say).</p>
        <p>As eager as the couples were to unite, others are as eager to see the outcome of all this civil joining. Opponents of civil unions predict legal tangles when out-of-staters try to get their Vermont civil unions recognized in their home state. Gay rights advocates say they are eager to show that the sky will not fall.</p>
        <p>''Same-sex couples will be forming civil unions and the state's not going to fall apart,'' said Beth Robinson, a lead lawyer in the case that prompted the civil unions law. ''It's just going to be better, and that's going to be the most helpful part of this dialogue. Because the longer we go with the law in effect, the more incredible the claims of our opponents will be exposed as being.''</p>
        <p>Over all, although today was mainly a day of joyful celebration for uniting couples, the broader picture in this pastoral state remains one of unusual turmoil -- particularly turmoil centered on November's elections and the effect the civil unions issue will have on them.</p>
        <p>Ever since the State Supreme Court ruled last December that denying gay couples the benefits of marriage amounted to unconstitutional discrimination, the question of gay unions has sundered the state, fanning atypical rancor. After months of difficult debate, the Legislature passed a civil unions law in April, and Gov. Howard Dean, a Democrat, promptly signed it. But the turbulence continues on several fronts.</p>
        <p>A few town clerks have said they would resign rather than issue civil union certificates, though most appear willing to abide by the law.</p>
        <p>''It's not that I'm not sympathetic to people and their needs, but I need to draw the line,'' said Gerry Longway, town clerk in Fairfield since 1980 and one of those considering resignation. ''It just doesn't seem right or fair.''</p>
        <p>Opponents of the law are also suing to overturn it, claiming it should be invalidated because as it was coming up for a vote in the Legislature, several lawmakers placed small bets as to what the margin would be. Their efforts to get a judge to block the law from taking effect failed, but they say they plan to pursue their legal battle.</p>
        <p>They are also forming a variety of small groups with names like ''Who Would Have Thought'' and ''Standing Together and Reclaiming the State'' to try to bring down lawmakers who voted for civil unions in the coming elections.</p>
        <p>Already, some opponents have  placed attack advertisements in Vermont's newspapers, including a black-bordered full-page advertisement in The Burlington Free Press on June 18 that denounced ''the insufferable hubris of the narcissistic gay lobby that would place personal pleasures before public order.'' It argued that it is ''probably no coincidence'' that financial markets began to slide as the same-sex marriage debate began here in February.</p>
        <p>Because Vermont's procedure for referendums is so cumbersome, few believe the civil unions law could be overturned that way; but if the composition of the Legislature changes, there is a chance that the new body could vote to alter the law. In that case, it would be up to the State Supreme Court to decide whether the law still complied with the court's ruling that gay couples must be given the same benefits as heterosexual couples.</p>
        <p>Advocates of civil unions have started their own political action committee, called Vermonters for Civil Unions, and plan to continue efforts at public education about gay marriage.</p>
        <p>Legal experts say it is not clear what will happen when out-of-staters get civilly united in Vermont and then ask their home states to recognize the Vermont union.</p>
        <p>Couples seeking civil unions must register with a town and have their unions solemnized by a member of the clergy or justice of the peace. Partners seeking to dissolve their unions must go through the Family Court just as divorcing couples do.</p>
        <p>Already, there are signs of a nascent gay wedding industry -- nothing fancy or flashy, but little in this green state of 600,000 ever is.</p>
        <p>A new Web site, www.gayweddingguide.com, offers everything from a fledgling gift registry for gay couples to a selection of inns, and the Web site of Vermont's gay newspaper, Out in the Mountains, offers a list of justices of the peace who are friendly to civil unions. People in the Vermont wedding industry say they expect a surge of civil unions in the coming days and weeks because of a long-pent-up demand.</p>
        <p>Marc Awodey, a justice of the peace in Burlington, said that he was  booked for one civil union on Monday and three others in July, two of them for out-of-state couples. He had heard of about 50 planned for the coming week, and about two dozen to be performed today.</p>
        <p>Estimates of the number of unions were difficult, however: Consider the spur-of-the-moment decision by Chuck Turner and Bill Miller, lounge owners from New Orleans who have been together 29 years and had happened to be traveling in Canada in a motor home on a long vacation with their mothers.</p>
        <p>They decided to dip down into Vermont on a quick break from their itinerary, lined up a justice of the peace, stopped at a mall for rings, and showed up, mothers in tow, in the South Burlington clerk's office this morning for their union.</p>
        <p>''Now,'' Mr. Miller said, ''We finally get to send wedding invitations to all those people who've been sending them to us for 30 years.''</p>
