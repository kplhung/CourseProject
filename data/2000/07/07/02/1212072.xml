        <p>STONEDIAL</p>
        <p>By George Konrad.</p>
        <p>Translated by Ivan Sanders.</p>
        <p>290 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book/Harcourt. $24.</p>
        <p>At the checkout line in a Budapest supermarket, I recently witnessed a miniature miracle. The cashier, busily gossiping with the clerk at the next register, took my money and tossed me a bag without missing a beat. It was classic Socialist treatment -- the customer as interruption. Then, as if a newly implanted circuit had flashed in her brain, she became all smiles and attention, packed my purchases and wished me a good day. She'd remembered that this was the new Hungary, where money counts and so do the people who spend it. That mind-set -- in which the past is all too intrusive and yet severed from the present -- is the terrain the gifted Hungarian writer George Konrad works in his latest novel, ''Stonedial.''</p>
        <p>After long wanderings, pushing 60, Janos Dragoman, scalawag man of letters, returns to his native city of Kandor, where he is celebrated for his ''rather sketchy achievements.'' It is not only worldliness and world-weariness but long memory that make Dragoman cast a jaundiced eye on the proceedings in the university's ceremonial hall. Some 40 years earlier, on a bulletin board in the hallway, he had been denounced as a ''class enemy.'' ''He hadn't believed the judgment then; he didn't believe the tributes paid to him now.''</p>
        <p>Dragoman has returned to the new Hungary, where a filmmaker has become mayor of Kandor and Ukrainian hit men offer competitive prices. But this is also a Hungary that dreams of a great new historical role for itself as a reborn Austro-Hungarian commercial and cultural capital. In the utterances of one of Dragoman's friends, whom he is later inadvertently to kill, metaphysics mixes with boosterism: ''If the earth is to survive its mistakes, we must all become saints. . . . Earth is God's favorite, and on this earth Kandor is a most precious spot.''</p>
        <p>Dragoman is dangerous. Not because he is a madcap with a cane that conceals a knife and a flask, a man who seduces wives with insouciance, as if adultery were the national pastime. The real reason, as someone tells him, is that ''there's always turmoil and turbulence around you, if you are on an airplane it's sure to be struck by lightning, wherever you stop over, age-old hatreds erupt, but revolutions show perfect timing and break out only after you've already had a good night's sleep at the hotel, a decent breakfast.'' More precisely, Dragoman is dangerous because the past still burns inside him.</p>
        <p>For his generation, that past is defined by the events of the autumn of 1956. Where you were and what you did during the uprising is forever the truth of who you are, no matter what convoluted changes both you and the world have undergone in the meantime. An individual's character can be revealed and fixed by actions taken in extreme circumstances, and some people don't wish to be reminded of this.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, such a reminder leads to a clash and a shoving match between Dragoman and a high-minded friend who was responsible, during the uprising, for the deaths of six insurgents -- as was, depending on your moral calculus, Dragoman himself. Responding in self-defense, Dragoman repels his friend, who falls, hits his head and dies. What has been played out is a parable of the edgy relationship of present and past in post-Communist Hungary. Some of the implications of this parable will elude the reader, the inevitable result of transplantation and translation, but that doesn't matter because the major pleasures of Konrad's novel lie elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Admirably translated by Ivan Sanders, ''Stonedial'' seems written by a Middle European Saul Bellow, part of the gene pool that didn't emigrate. In the novel, we live entirely in the universe of an intellectual, although both third- and first-person narration are employed. It is a tribute to Konrad's abilities that after a time he makes these irritating shifts seem graceful as well as useful.</p>
        <p>This is an intellectual novel in every sense -- by one and about one, intended for page readers rather than page turners. The plot is perfunctory, intentionally gimmicky, the better to serve the pointed allegory. It is not the colorful aspects of Dragoman that hold our attention but the largeness of his life, which we are able to inhabit. Though there are a good many incidents along the way, they don't take place with the usual immediacy of a novel; instead, they feel filtered, recounted. This does not mean that, as in a Bellow novel, there aren't moments of the loveliest poetry. At one point, Dragoman thinks to himself, ''I somehow connected the pastry shop smell of pregnant women with the matchless smell of fresh-cut hay that hovers around babies' heads.'' He had been a roue for the best and most Hungarian of reasons -- excess fondness of women.</p>
        <p>A novel that is about the intrusion of the past into the present is, by definition, about time and changing times. How exactly to hold, define and evaluate those 40 years between the uprising and the fall of Communism: ''Were those 40 years nothing but a mistake, a detour, a waste? Didn't they read or write anything worthwhile in those 40 years? Didn't they ever find their sweethearts' gestures endearing? Or have a decent cut of meat, drink tolerably good wines? Didn't they ever take their children skating or to a ballet class? Or gaze at the stars?''</p>
        <p>The present is amply satirized in the course of the novel -- contemporary Hungary suffers from all the ailments of the modern era but has contracted them unfashionably late. There is nothing quite so crude and ludicrous as striving to be up to date: ''There is a new vocabulary, a new set of tricks, new people concealing old greed with new slogans. A change in philosophy, a renaming of things, underlings learning to kowtow in a different direction -- an underdeveloped country switching illusions in an attempt to catch up with the leaders of the pack. It can't be done.''</p>
        <p>The past, those days in October and November of 1956, is brilliantly rendered in a jumpy, black-and-white newsreel style that is blended with more lyrical evocations of Dragoman either in bed with a girl or out with a machine gun slung over his shoulder. A Hungarian taxi driver once said to me that some things were better under Communism. ''What?'' I asked him. ''I was young,'' he replied. The uprising was Dragoman's youth, but he bears that youth, that past, into the present, where it ignites into life again.</p>
