        <p>Looking back from the finish of the Sigeman &amp; Company International Tournament in Malmo, Sweden, May 23 to May 29, one can pick out the third-round encounter between Judit Polgar of Hungary and Jan Timman of the Netherlands as decisive. Polgar won a turbulent struggle that eventually gained her first prize and relegated Timman to second place.</p>
        <p>Polgar scored 4-2 in the four-player double-round competition. Timman scored 3 1/2-1 1/2. Ulf Andersson of Sweden was third at 2 1/2-3 1/2 and Tiger Hillarp-Persson, also of Sweden, was last with 2-4.</p>

        <p>Looking back from the finish of the Sigeman &amp; Company International Tournament in Malmo, Sweden, May 23 to May 29, one can pick out the third-round encounter between Judit Polgar of Hungary and Jan Timman of the Netherlands as decisive. Polgar won a turbulent struggle that eventually gained her first prize and relegated Timman to second place.</p>
        <p>Polgar scored 4-2 in the four-player double-round competition. Timman scored 3 1/2-1 1/2. Ulf Andersson of Sweden was third at 2 1/2-3 1/2 and Tiger Hillarp-Persson, also of Sweden, was last with 2-4.</p>
        <p>In a complicated situation on his 25th move, Timman overlooked an ingenious combination that would have won. Granted that reprieve, Polgar exploited her opportunities with crunching vigor.</p>
        <p>When Aron Nimzovich first played 4 . . . Ba6 in the Queen's Indian Defense 70 years ago, he was ridiculed, but nowadays it is orthodox to pressure White this way and force a defense of the c pawn.</p>
        <p>In place of 7 Bc3, Aleksandr Fominyh thrust 7 d5 against Konstantin Sakayev in last year's Russian Championship, but after 7 . . . Ne7 8 de fe 9 Bg2 Nf5 10 O-O Bc5 11 Nc3 O-O 12 Qc2 Qe8, Black obtained dangerous attacking chances on the kingside.</p>
        <p>Polgar recaptured with 11 . . . Qd5 to avoid a partly blocked formation with 11 . . . ed, which would not favor the deployment of her bishop pair. She did not mind Timman's advancing in the center with 12 e4, gaining a tempo.</p>
        <p>Polgar's 14 . . . f5 was necessary to diminish the white center.</p>
        <p>Timman played sharply with 16 Qc3! Qd5 17 Ne5!, threatening Polgar's knight, which was pinned down by the latent threat of mate at c7. Polgar fought back with 17 . . . e3 18 Ndf3 ef 19 Kf2 Rhf8, and after Timman unpinned with 20 Kg2, she threw a few more coals on the fire with 20 . . . g5!?</p>
        <p>She should safely have won a bishop and two pawns for a rook by 20 . . . Rf3 21 Nf3 b5 22 Be2 Rd7 23 Rhd1 Bf6 24 Qe3 Nd4.</p>
        <p>After 21 Nc6, she had lost a piece. But after 21 Rd7, Timman faced the threat of 22 . . . g4.</p>
        <p>The critical moment came after 24 . . . Qc6. Timman missed 25 bc Rd4 26 h3 h5 27 cb Rc4 28 Qb3 Rc1 29 Rc1 Qc1 30 ba Kd7 31 Ne5 Kd6 32 Nc4 Kd5 33 Qb5 c5 34 Nb6 Kd4 35 Qd7 Ke5 36 Qg7 Rf6 37 Nd7 Kd6 38 Qf6 Qa3 39 Qf8 Kd7 40 d8/Q, winning for White.</p>
        <p>Instead, his 25 Rhf1? ran afoul of 25 . . . h5!, when 26 bc hg 27 cb gf 28 Rf3 Qf3 29 Qf3 Rf3 30 Kf3 ab yields Polgar an endgame with an extra pawn.</p>
        <p>Moreover, 26 h3 fails against 26 . . . hg 27 hg Qe4! 28 bc Qg4 29 Kf2 Rd4! 30 cb Rd2! 31 Qd2 Rf3 32 Ke1 Qg3 33 Rf2 Qg1.</p>
        <p>So, he unpinned with 26 Kg1, but after 26 . . . Rf3! 27 Qf3 Qf3 28 Rf3 hg 29 Rg3 Bd4 30 Kh1 Be5 31 Rg4 Bf4, Polgar had the advantage of a bishop plus two pawns for a rook.</p>
        <p>After 40 . . . e2, Timman gave up in view of 41 Kf2 Bd2 42 Re4 gh followed by 43 . . . e1.</p>
