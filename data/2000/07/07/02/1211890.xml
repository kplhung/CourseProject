        <p>For nearly a decade, the hired gun for Long Island's eco-radicals, Richard L. Amper Jr., has sought to vilify every developer who ever wanted to strengthen our economy. Now he seems to be on to far easier prey: our children [''Satire Campaign Gets Ross School's Goat,'' June 25].</p>

        <p>For nearly a decade, the hired gun for Long Island's eco-radicals, Richard L. Amper Jr., has sought to vilify every developer who ever wanted to strengthen our economy. Now he seems to be on to far easier prey: our children [''Satire Campaign Gets Ross School's Goat,'' June 25].</p>
        <p>Whatever the merits of a proposal by the Ross School to create an educational institute on their East Hampton property, the idea of putting students in the cross hairs of the debate is grotesque.</p>
        <p>It is no surprise that Mr. Amper, executive director of the Pine Barrens Society, was backed into a legal corner when he overreached with a misinformation campaign and had to issue a carefully worded apology.</p>
        <p>His cartoon parody is the low-water mark of a society that seeks to attack personally anyone who disagrees with its agenda. For the students who were the target of his mean-spirited trick, Mr. Amper's apology will make a very good civics lesson in what happens when you combine cynicism and vitriol.</p>
