        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Feeling Like an Orphan in Ma Bell's Domain'' (Coping, May 28): Oh, Sarah Kershaw, if you only knew! You are not alone.</p>
        <p>I have been calling the phone company Hell Atlantic for so long I make out the checks that way (of course, they manage to cash them).</p>
        <p>I had an experience just as mystifying as yours when I moved to Brooklyn. And earlier when I had a second line installed in Manhattan (which took 12 Bell Atlantic employees five days, for which the company received $85). But the real cake-taker was when I, dissatisfied with Hell's ''service'' switched to another local carrier, RCN. It was far worse: calls about my ISDN line were transferred to the various Internet service providers they own, and they were unable to repair the line at all, as it was owned by Hell. So back I went, tail between my legs, to Hell.</p>
        <p>On the same date for the next three months, my line would go out.  After more calls to more departments than I could count, I found out that my line was being billed to another person in Brooklyn, who kept asking Hell to disconnect it. Hell never found the reason or cause for this, but I too found a savior amid the Bureaucratic Gomorrah, who simply reconnected my line so he wouldn't have to deal with me anymore.</p>
        <p>When my ordeal was over, I sent a rather comical letter to the Hell president, Ivan G. Seidenberg, including an invoice for my time, business lost and the computer technician I had to hire. Apparently Ivan was not amused, as I never received a response. You, fortunately have the power of the press behind you. Send 'em that cell phone bill.</p>
