        <p>Eight hours before a $1,000-a-person fundraiser for his nascent campaign for governor, Mayor Bret Schundler stood before reporters and posed a question that to him was simple: ''Should police officers get overtime for shining their shoes, doing their laundry?'' he asked. ''I don't think so.''</p>
        <p>The question was by no means hypothetical. Indeed, it may be precisely what a federal judge ends up asking jurors if the mayor and 625 of this city' police officers -- two-thirds of the state's second-largest police department -- cannot come to terms in a labor dispute.</p>

        <p>Eight hours before a $1,000-a-person fundraiser for his nascent campaign for governor, Mayor Bret Schundler stood before reporters and posed a question that to him was simple: ''Should police officers get overtime for shining their shoes, doing their laundry?'' he asked. ''I don't think so.''</p>
        <p>The question was by no means hypothetical. Indeed, it may be precisely what a federal judge ends up asking jurors if the mayor and 625 of this city' police officers -- two-thirds of the state's second-largest police department -- cannot come to terms in a labor dispute.</p>
        <p>In what experts say could significantly expand the scope of what public employees -- and perhaps any employees -- are entitled to be paid for, the officers are suing the city under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, seeking overtime for hours spent, in part, shining shoes, buffing brass buttons and otherwise polishing their appearance before leaving home to protect and serve the public.</p>
        <p>If the officers win the suit, which was filed in United States District Court in April 1999, it could cost Jersey City taxpayers up to $50 million, including $25 million in estimated overtime, plus another $25 million in penalties the officers would be entitled to under a provision of the 62-year-old labor law if they demonstrate that the city willfully defied its obligations.</p>
        <p>The cost of sprucing up uniforms: an estimated $5 million of the total overtime bill, plus another $5 million in penalties. The claims date back three years before the suit was filed, the period allowed under the law, said Steve Hunter, the attorney for the officers.</p>
        <p>The case is being closely watched because of its implications for public and private employers not only in New Jersey, but around the country.</p>
        <p>''I think that this will, in fact, establish a very dangerous precedent for other municipalities,'' William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities. ''One thing we have learned in labor matters like this, it does not stop at one union's doorstep.''</p>
        <p>Beyond a potential liability that would amount to about 15 percent of Jersey City's $313 million annual budget, the issue has implications for the political future of Mr. Schundler, the 41-year-old mayor who became a darling of Republicans nationwide after his landslide victory in 1993 in this traditionally Democratic stonghold.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schundler -- whose star has faded somewhat as he has stumbled while trying to deal with the political complexities of running an economically and socially diverse city of a quarter-million people -- plans to run for governor next year. One reason he summoned reporters to his office last Wednesday morning was to ridicule the suit as frivolous and to head off the city's two police unions from holding a demonstration outside a fund-raiser that night at the Liberty Science Center.</p>
        <p>''The police are asking us to sell out the taxpayers for our political peace,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Tom Bell, president of the city's 710-member Police Officers Benevolent Association, and Lt. Ron Bounocore, president of the Police Superior Officers Association, which has 160 members, made no secret of their strategy to pressure Mr. Schundler into settling the suit by demonstrating in front of his supporters.</p>
        <p>''We are going to follow him throughout the state on the road to the governership,'' Officer Bell said.</p>
        <p>The union officials said it was typical of Mr. Schundler to manipulate the situation by focusing on the shoe-shining element of the suit, even though it was only one of several issues. For example, they said, the department regularly denies compensatory pay to officers forced to skip lunch.</p>
        <p>''You are eating a doughnut on the run because you can't sit down,'' Lieutenant Bounocore said.</p>
        <p>The suit also claims that $4.5 million is owed to 125 police cadets because they were denied overtime despite working 18 days during six months of training. In addition, the suit seeks compensation for the time officers spent learning law-enforcement policies. Nor, the suit claims, have officers have been compensated for appearances on behalf of Drug Awareness Resistence Education (D.A.R.E.) for children.</p>
        <p>In the past, officers had accepted that the time spent taking care of their uniforms was part of the job, and never sought compensation, the union officials said. It was only after the mayor had failed to address the other grievances, the officials said, that they filed the suit and included the spit-and-polish issue.</p>
        <p>The suit comes after years of steadily eroding morale in the department -- almost from the start of Mr. Schundler's tenure -- stemming from such moves as the appointment of a civilian police director, Michael Moriarty, a former federal drug prosecutor, and an attempt to have civilians take over desk jobs in the department.</p>
        <p>After the mayor's news conference, the union officials threw their own public relations counterpunch by welcoming reporters into the aging North District station house, where they were shown dingy bathrooms, cramped lockers, flickering light fixtures and collapsing ceilings.</p>
        <p>In the end, however, it was the mayor who seemed to win the day's public relations battle. Reporters were clearly more interested in the shoe-shine story. After a conciliatory phone call from Mr. Schundler that  afternoon, Lieutenant Bounocore called off the demonstration and agreed to meet with the mayor this week. ''He's extending the olive branch,'' Lieutenant Bonoucore said, ''so our sign of good faith was that we would not demonstrate.''</p>
        <p>But the lawsuit is still very much alive,  and a hearing is scheduled for September before a federal magistrate in Newark.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hunter said he was confident he would prevail -- even on the shoe-shine claim. He cited a ruling by Judge Alfred A. Wolin in Federal District Court in Newark last year in favor of officers in the Bergen County sheriff's K-9 unit who had sought overtime for the home care of their canine partners. He contended that Judge Wolin also suggested officers could put in for overtime related to other tasks, including the care and maintenance of their uniforms.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the city's labor lawyer, Martin Pachman, was unfazed.</p>
        <p>''We believe Judge Wolin was wrong,'' Mr. Pachman said, although he declined to cite legal precedent contradicting the judge.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for the state and federal Departments of Labor said they had never heard of an overtime claim for time spent spiffing up uniforms. Neither had William J. Kearns Jr., president of the International Municipal Lawyers Association. Mr. Kearns, a former mayor of Willingboro, who is also general counsel for the state League of Municipalities, said the Jersey City suit ''is certainly pushing the envelope'' for overtime claims, almost to the point of the absurd.</p>
        <p>''Where are we going to draw the line?'' Mr. Kearns said. ''Are we going to pay them for taking their shower in the morning?''</p>
