        <p>To the Gothic tower and arches of the McCarter Theater at Princeton University, a new, more intimate playhouse -- the Berlind Theater -- is to be added, with construction starting early next year.</p>
        <p>Named in honor of the Broadway producer Roger S. Berlind, a 1952 Princeton graduate, the 29,000-square-foot building with its 350-seat theater is intended as a contemporary complement to the 71-year-old, 1,100-seat McCarter, which won a Tony Award in 1994 for outstanding regional theater and has seen two productions -- ''Having Our Say'' and ''Electra'' -- go on to Broadway since 1995.</p>
        <p>''The big stage house at McCarter has those Gothic arches, probably 80 feet tall, and the 130-foot tower,'' said Hugh Hardy of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, the new theater's architect.</p>
        <p>''This building will be connected on the south side,'' Mr. Hardy said, ''and to complement the older building we are using patterned horizontal masonry and stone -- various patterns -- that tie to the vertical dimension of the McCarter's Gothic composition. It's the same kind of masonry, but a freer, more contemporary interpretation.''</p>
        <p>The managing director of the McCarter, Jeffrey Woodward, said the thinking behind construction of the new theater is ''to give our artistic staff greater flexibility in programming.''</p>
        <p>''The current theater,'' Mr. Woodward said, ''is not always conducive to small plays. And the new theater will be better suited for that kind of intimate work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlind -- a producer of ''Kiss Me,  Kate,'' which won this year's Tony for best musical revival, and of ''Copenhagen,'' winner of this year's Tony for best play -- has contributed $3.5 million toward the $10.5 million cost of the new theater. So far, about $8.5 million has been pledged. Construction is expected to take 14 months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hardy said the new theater ''should be a spirited space where all the paraphernalia of stage production -- the lighting and catwalks and all the systems used to make theater -- become part of the design.''</p>
