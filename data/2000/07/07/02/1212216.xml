        <p>IN contrast to Bill Willoughby's lonely teenage existence during his rookie year in the National Basketball Association, there are now eight players on N.B.A. rosters who eschewed college ball and went right from high school to the pros.</p>
        <p>One player, Al Harrington, who just completed his second season for the Indiana Pacers, came to the N.B.A. out of St. Patrick's High School in Elizabeth. He averaged 6.9 points and 6.6 rebounds a game as a forward for the runner-up Pacers.</p>

        <p>IN contrast to Bill Willoughby's lonely teenage existence during his rookie year in the National Basketball Association, there are now eight players on N.B.A. rosters who eschewed college ball and went right from high school to the pros.</p>
        <p>One player, Al Harrington, who just completed his second season for the Indiana Pacers, came to the N.B.A. out of St. Patrick's High School in Elizabeth. He averaged 6.9 points and 6.6 rebounds a game as a forward for the runner-up Pacers.</p>
        <p>On his team is another player who came right out of high school to the N.B.A., Jonathan Bender, a 6-foot-11-inch center who sat on the bench most of the time as a rookie this year after graduating from high school in Mississippi in 1999.</p>
        <p>Then there is Rashard Lewis of the Seattle Supersonics, who went to high school in Texas, and Jermaine O'Neal of the Portland Trail Blazers who attended high school in South Carolina -- who also have not reached their potential.</p>
        <p>But the other four current N.B.A. players who did not go to college have had All-Star or very promising seasons.</p>
        <p>Kobe Bryant, even though he scored nearly 1200 on his College Boards, left Lower Merion High School outside Philadelphia four years ago, and this year helped lead the Los Angeles Lakers to the N.B.A. championship.</p>
        <p>Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves went to high school in South Carolina and Illinois and had an immediate impact as one of the premier frontcourt men in the N.B.A.</p>
        <p>Shawn Kemp, currently with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who actually spent a few months at Trinity Junior College in Texas after high school in Indiana, has been at or near All-Star status for 10 years.</p>
        <p>And Tracy McGrady of the Toronto Raptors and Mt. Zion Christian Academy in North Carolina is touted to be a starter next year.</p>
        <p>Robert Bradley, a basketball historian, said there were 24 players before Mr. Willoughby, mostly just after World War II, who did not go to college. For many years, there was a prohibition against anyone entering the N.B.A. draft until their college class had graduated, but that rule was dropped when Spencer Haywood, who was having financial and academic trouble at the University of Detroit, sued the N.B.A. to be allowed to enter the league before his class graduated.</p>
        <p>Through the 1970's, the players technically had to show financial hardship -- as Mr. Willoughby and Darryl Dawkins did in 1975 -- to enter the N.B.A. draft early. Now all one has to do is apply -- and hope to get drafted and sign a contract.</p>
