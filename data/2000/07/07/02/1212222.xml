        <p>IT'S a hot summer Saturday and a bunch of college kids have congregated at a tavern in Rahway. But it's not what you think. These kids are lining up to sift dirt and stand neck deep in a 200-year-old privy, hoping to come up with an ancient bottle or prize chunk of porcelain.</p>
        <p>They are students at Monmouth University, and for the past six weekends Richard F.

        <p>IT'S a hot summer Saturday and a bunch of college kids have congregated at a tavern in Rahway. But it's not what you think. These kids are lining up to sift dirt and stand neck deep in a 200-year-old privy, hoping to come up with an ancient bottle or prize chunk of porcelain.</p>
        <p>They are students at Monmouth University, and for the past six weekends Richard F. Veit, an assistant professor of anthropology there, has had them conducting an archaeological dig on the grounds of the Merchants and Drovers Tavern, trying to shed light on the building's long history. It's a terrific example of learning by doing, but that's only part of the story: the dig also dovetails perfectly with a visionary effort by the Rahway Historical Society to give the old tavern a new life as a museum.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to help them understand how the property has changed over time,'' Professor Veit said last weekend as about 20 students worked in a half-dozen holes dug on the tavern property. One hole yielded hints that another building once stood next to the tavern -- there was a cache of bricks about four feet down, a chunk of metal that might have been part of a hearth, a buckle, a pipe bowl. Across the yard, the site of the tavern's privy was proving, somewhat perversely, to be a historical gold mine.</p>
        <p>Diggers there found a delicate little medicine bottle, the kind of collectible that brings big bucks on eBay.com -- ''Dr. Wistar's balsam of wild cherry,'' it says. Then, from about five feet down, came two cod liver oil bottles. Emerging with them, looking eerily like something from the ''Chuckie'' movies, was a porcelain doll's head -- incredibly, like the bottles, unbroken after who knows how many years underground.</p>
        <p>Professor Veit and his students have found a multitude of such artifacts. The digging was to wrap up this weekend; the next task is to analyze the discoveries to see what insights they yield.</p>
        <p>Professor Veit, who has led students on similar digs around the state for the past several summers, said the work could help create a sort of biography of a site. The artifacts can indicate when the tavern was the most prosperous, how the decline of stagecoach travel or the arrival of Prohibition affected it, and so on.</p>
        <p>''It's almost as if we're historians discovering new documents that no one's ever seen before,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The students, despite the dirt and sweat and missed opportunities to go to the beach, seem to love it. ''I've learned a lot of field method I didn't know before -- how the research begins,'' said Adele Barbato, taking lunch break in the shade.</p>
        <p>''It's hands-on,'' agreed Susan Fries, another digger. ''It's better than reading about artifacts in a textbook and how an excavation is done.''</p>
        <p>But the property is not just a site with a past. It's a site with a future, an ambitious one.</p>
        <p>The tavern, a rambling yellow building at the intersection of Westfield and St. Georges, has stood since the late 1700's. It was a tavern and inn for most of that time, but many residents call it the Girl Scout House because for about three decades it was used by that organization. In recent years it has been idle, waiting for some savior to step in and halt its slow deterioration.</p>
        <p>That savior turned out to be the Rahway Historical Society, which undertook an expensive, exhaustive effort to turn the tavern back into a focal point of the community. The group stabilized the foundation, stopped the flooding that would leave the furnace underwater several times a year, and set about rediscovering the historic building that was hidden under numerous renovations. Several months' work remain, but it's already clear the project is an impressive success.</p>
        <p>''Whatever was old, we kept it old,'' said Theodore J. Nevins, president of the society. ''Whatever was new, we fixed it.''</p>
        <p>''Fixed it'' generally meant peeling it away. Flooring came up, until the original wide plank floor was exposed. Track lighting came down. Window panes that had been replaced with modern glass when they broke were replaced again, with antique glass that restores the original look.</p>
        <p>The idea, said Mr. Nevins, who stopped by last weekend to check on the dig and ended up giving an impromptu tour, is to make the building and grounds look the way they did about 1820.</p>
        <p>The society wants to create a museum where schoolchildren and other visitors can get a palpable sense of the stagecoach era and the role a tavern like the Merchants and Drovers played. Mr. Nevins said there has even been talk of putting a working privy out back, where the original was. What better way to give children a sense of how far the humble bathroom has come?</p>
