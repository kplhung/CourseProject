        <p>Last September, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority temporarily closed the walkway across the Marine Parkway-Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge. The agency is widening the roadway across the bridge, and the walkway will be closed until spring 2001.</p>

        <p>Last September, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority temporarily closed the walkway across the Marine Parkway-Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge. The agency is widening the roadway across the bridge, and the walkway will be closed until spring 2001.</p>
        <p>The closing poses no problem for in-line skaters and pedestrians, who can jump on the Q35 bus, which still crosses the bridge. But it is another matter altogether for cyclists, who are not permitted to bring their bikes on city buses.</p>
        <p>To service them, the M.T.A. has created a free, bikers-only shuttle that will run back and forth across the bridge every half hour, from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., seven days a week this summer.</p>
        <p>Some cyclists, however, say the shuttle is not working out as planned, which has led the M.T.A. to revise its arrangements. The bicyclists say the shuttles used so far can accommodate only four bikes, a number they say falls far below the capacity needed in the summer.</p>
        <p>Some also object to the twine that drivers use to fasten the bikes to the racks; they say that the bikes are not secure and that the tying and untying take too long.</p>
        <p>Linda Kaplan of Park Slope, Brooklyn, decided to go to Jacob Riis Park with a group of friends recently. But other cyclists were already waiting, and soon the racks were fully loaded, without the group's bikes. As Ms. Kaplan and her friends contemplated waiting for another shuttle, they became further agitated because the driver of the loaded van waited for another 15 minutes so that he could leave on the half hour. ''We wanted to have a nice day and there was a war of the bikes,'' Ms. Kaplan said.</p>
        <p>Mary Christopher of Marine Park, Brooklyn, had a different gripe. She planned a day at the beach with her three little children, but the smallest child's bike was too little to put on the rack, and the driver said placing it on the shuttle itself would have been a safety hazard.</p>
        <p>So Ms. Christopher, frustrated, returned home. ''People think there's going to be service, and then they ride all the way out there, and they can't go to the beach,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Cathy Sweeney, an M.T.A. spokeswoman, said the agency was working to improve the situation. Starting this weekend, she said, the shuttles will have trailers attached that can store 15 bikes.</p>
        <p>She also said the agency was exploring other means of securing the bikes to the racks, and was instructing drivers to be more accommodating to riders with children's bikes and to leave the shuttle stops as soon as the racks were full.</p>
        <p>''We're going to watch it carefully,'' Ms. Sweeney said. ''We're going to be in shakedown mode. We're concerned about people who use bikes, and we have to get the service working a little better.''</p>
