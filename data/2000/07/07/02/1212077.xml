        <p>Thomas Swick letter on Karen Karbo's June 4 review of travel books holds real change has been movement from descriptive to analytical</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In her review of travel books (June 4), Karen Karbo says that the genre now requires ''a gimmick, an angle, a concept'' and presents this information as if it were a news flash. But the gimmick in travel writing is as venerable as Robert Louis Stevenson or, if you prefer, Geoffrey Chaucer. The real change has been the movement from the mere descriptive to the analytical. In an age when everybody has been everywhere (or at least seen it all on the Travel Channel), it is not enough simply to paint a picture or even chat up a local; the best travel writers -- Jonathan Raban, Colin Thubron, Pico Iyer -- add to this the interpretation of landscapes and the decoding of symbols. And in the process they have not only perpetuated the genre but taken it to a high-er plane.</p>
