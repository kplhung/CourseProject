        <p>Janice Moodie of Scotland challenged twice this season for her first victory without success, but she never led going into the last day the way she does at the ShopRite L.P.G.A. Classic. Moodie has a two-shot lead in the $1.1 million tournament and said she was not worried about any mental lapses in Sunday's final round.</p>
        <p>''I'm blonde,'' Moodie said with a laugh when asked whether she would be preoccupied thinking about the final round, ''so I'll just go back and think about nothing.''</p>
        <p>Moodie has a two-day total of eight-under-par 134 after shooting a three-under 68 with birdies on two of the final three holes today on the 6,051-yard Bay Course at the Seaview Marriott resort.</p>
        <p>The 27-year-old Moodie will actually have a great deal to think about because one of the five players tied for second at 136 is Juli Inkster, who captured the McDonald's L.P.G.A Championship last week and has won this tournament twice, in 1986 and 1988.</p>
        <p>Inkster shot a 66 and was tied with Dina Ammaccapane (66), Vickie Odegard (67), Jackie Gallagher-Smith (70) and Maria Hjorth of Sweden, who tied the course and tournament record with an eight-under 63. An eagle and six birdies enabled Hjorth to tie the record set last year by Se Ri Pak on opening day as part of her wire-to-wire triumph. Today, Pak had a 75 for 145 and missed the cut.</p>
        <p>While Inkster had a steady round with five birdies on the last seven holes, Moodie was rather erratic with six birdies and three bogeys. She also missed eight greens, but was able to score well because the course is similar to courses in her native Scotland.</p>
        <p>''This is the kind of course similar to the British Open,'' Moodie said of the flat course, originally designed by Donald Ross almost a century ago. ''There are a lot of punched shots, and you can get it up and down.''</p>
        <p>Hjorth attributed her success to a change in her swing. She went to the driving range after shooting 73 on opening day and worked for close to two hours. ''I was really struggling with it,'' she said. ''It was getting flat and I was hooking shots all day, so I got my swing more upright.''</p>
        <p>The 26-year-old Hjorth, who shot a first-round 73, got into a groove with an eagle on the third hole, at 475 yards the shortest of the course's three par-5's.</p>
        <p>Hjorth's drive was so long that her approach shot with a 7-iron came from 160 yards and landed within 6 feet of the cup. She averaged 258 yards on her drives for the day.</p>
        <p>''That eagle on three got me pumped up, and I really got going from there,'' Hjorth said. ''The way I hit the ball, I'm capable of low scores. I've just had a bad last couple months,'' she said, referring to four missed cuts in the last five events.</p>
        <p>Hjorth's scoring average is 72.83 primarily because of her putting. She is 171st on the Tour in putting, and the longest putt she made for her six birdies today was 12 feet. Her best finish this year was a playoff loss to Nancy Scranton in the Subaru Memorial in Naples, Fla.</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>JEAN ZEDLITZ aced the 170-yard seventh with 7-iron and won a Subaru Outback. She shot a 75 and made the cut at 144. . . . BETSY KING came back with a 67 after a 75 on opening day.</p>
