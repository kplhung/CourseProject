        <p>Some people in College Point are hoping that a little portion of a road will help them stop Home Depot from opening a new store.</p>
        <p>The home-improvement retailer plans to build a store in the College Point Corporate Park near 31st Avenue and College Point Boulevard. Home Depot owns both the building lot and the road, which it hopes will furnish a second way for shoppers to enter and  leave the new store's parking lot.</p>

        <p>Some people in College Point are hoping that a little portion of a road will help them stop Home Depot from opening a new store.</p>
        <p>The home-improvement retailer plans to build a store in the College Point Corporate Park near 31st Avenue and College Point Boulevard. Home Depot owns both the building lot and the road, which it hopes will furnish a second way for shoppers to enter and  leave the new store's parking lot.</p>
        <p>But Home Depot cannot use the road for this purpose if the police, the Transportation Department or another city agency has plans for it.  The Board of Standards and Appeals will address that issue at a hearing this month.</p>
        <p>''I hope they don't get it,'' said Sabina Cardali, president of the College Point Civic and Taxpayers Association. ''Maybe that will stop them. We need a school desperately and what do we get? A duplicate store.''</p>
        <p>There are already four Home Depots in Queens. The proposed fifth  outlet would be 1.6 miles from the one on Avery Avenue in Flushing, which is one of the company's five busiest stores in the world.</p>
        <p>Last month, Community Board 7 voted against allowing Home Depot the use of the road.</p>
        <p>Marilyn Bitterman, the district manager for the board, said that although the vote was only advisory, the board was trying to tell the company that ''you're not welcome in our neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>College Point residents also say that if Home Depot builds in their area, which already has several megastores, they will face serious traffic problems.</p>
        <p>Fred Mazzarello, president of the College Point Board of Trade, also said he was convinced that Home Depot was determined to put local merchants out of business.</p>
        <p>''They have a take-no-prisoners attitude,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The company's officials, however, do not see themselves as the enemy.</p>
        <p>''We find ourselves in a situation where we have to plan for opening new stores to relieve the pressure that is on the existing stores,'' said John Simley, a Home Depot spokesman. He said local merchants could survive by selling items and services unavailable at Home Depot. The company, he added, even refers shoppers to local stores when it cannot provide what customers seek.</p>
        <p>Despite the hopes of some residents, Mr. Simley said, ''If we don't get to use the road it will just make a little inconvenience, but it's not going to stop the project.''</p>
        <p>But Eduardo Juarez, a merchant who has run New Village Carpet, on College Point Boulevard, for the last 20 years, said he might be forced out of business if a new Home Depot was built.</p>
        <p>''We can't compete with them,'' he said. ''If we can't pay my expenses, we'll probably have to close.''</p>
