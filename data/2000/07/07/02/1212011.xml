        <p>Three weeks ago in Arkansas, Mike Ross, a state senator, defeated Dewayne Graham, a former television reporter, in a race for the Democratic nomination in the Fourth Congressional District.

        <p>Three weeks ago in Arkansas, Mike Ross, a state senator, defeated Dewayne Graham, a former television reporter, in a race for the Democratic nomination in the Fourth Congressional District. So when might the party expect Mr. Graham to fall in line and endorse Mr. Ross, considered by state and national Democratic leaders to be the best hope to oust the four-term Republican incumbent, Representative Jay Dickey?</p>
        <p>It won't happen.</p>
        <p>The party leaders were so taken with Mr. Ross and the help he might give them in recapturing control of the House of Representatives that they took the unusual step of choosing sides and endorsing him before the primary vote. Mr. Graham was left fuming.</p>
        <p>And last Wednesday he went for revenge. He endorsed Mr. Dickey, saying somewhat enigmatically, ''He's one of us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham, who once was a Republican and whose loss to Mr. Ross left him $50,000 in debt, also said he might end up doing some campaign consulting for Mr. Dickey -- on a contract basis.</p>
        <p>''I'll be available,'' he said. But he insisted there was no quid pro quo with Mr. Dickey.</p>
        <p>Democrats did not let that one pass.</p>
        <p>''You have someone in effect who's broke and looking for a job,'' said Vaughn McQuary, the state Democratic chairman. ''People have to weigh how sincere his support for Jay Dickey is as opposed to paying off his debt.''</p>
