        <p>AFTER nearly two years of watching rents soar and space dwindle in Manhattan's office market, Laurence Gluck made his move. Mr. Gluck and a  partner recently brought a 650,000-square-foot office complex on Route 4, just over the George Washington Bridge in Hackensack, N.J.</p>
        <p>The three-building complex, known as Continental Plaza, is the first office acquisition outside of Manhattan for Mr. Gluck, the principal in Stellar Management Ltd., which, with a variety of partners, owns or manages four million square feet of commercial space. In April his company, together with Capital Real Estate of Manhattan, paid $79 million for the complex, where 200,000 square feet of space is available or soon will be.</p>
        <p>''The complex was a good value in an excellent submarket that is getting better, and in a location that could take advantage of the strength of the Manhattan market,'' Mr. Gluck said. ''We feel we can attract core tenants from New Jersey as well as those from Manhattan who don't have to be in the city and want to avail themselves of lower costs.''</p>
        <p>There is no corporate occupancy tax in New Jersey, and electric power rates and real estate taxes are well below those in New York, said Mitchell Konsker, an executive director in the Manhattan office of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the international brokerage company.</p>
        <p>He is a member of one of two teams of brokers, one based in the Manhattan office and the other in East Rutherford, N.J., who are leasing agents for Continental Plaza. This two-pronged approach reflects the two sources of tenants that are being tapped.</p>
        <p>Asking rents at the complex average $32 a square foot, about half of those for comparable space in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Konsker said.</p>
        <p>In the last few years such cost benefits have lured a stream of tenants from downtown Manhattan to office towers on the west bank of the Hudson, mainly in Jersey City, including Paine Webber; Goldman, Sachs;  and most recently, Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>
        <p>Last month, the bank announced it would relocate many employees from 55 Water Street in downtown Manhattan to one million square feet in a mixed-use complex being developed by the Lefrak Organization  at Newport in Jersey City. The move, contingent on final approval of incentives from Trenton. will involve about 1,900 employees and several hundred consultants in the business services, general auditing and other departments.</p>
        <p>BUT rents on the waterfront are rising, and the availability of space is limited (new construction, where possible, takes time). Aware of these factors and of the ever-tighter Manhattan market, Mr. Gluck is one of a number of landlords and investors with available space in existing buildings who are betting that now is a good time to attract Manhattan tenants with immediate space needs to other close-in markets in New Jersey, like parts of Bergen County.</p>
        <p>Other property owners in the county gearing up to draw Manhattan tenants include a landlord with a 160,000-square-foot building elsewhere in Hackensack and an investment group buying an office building with 131,000 square feet in Lyndhurst.</p>
        <p>Many commercial brokers said the space squeeze in Manhattan and on the Hudson River waterfront was causing companies to search inland in New Jersey for alternatives. But no one is predicting that a flock of New York companies will make the leap.</p>
        <p>''The floodgates in the inland areas haven't opened because of concerns by New York companies of the potential loss of employees, and the minimal amount of large available blocks of prime space,'' said Jeffrey Babikian, the senior managing director at the Saddle Brook office of Insignia/ESG, the real estate services company. Once they get over those hurdles and focus on the savings, areas of New Jersey away from the Hudson become viable options, he added.</p>
        <p>In the case of Bergen County, Steven M. Frank, a senior vice president at the Teaneck office of the CB Richard Ellis brokerage company, said, ''We've always seen a flow of Manhattan companies, and it has picked up in recent months.''</p>
        <p>Driving the market are smaller tenants taking 5,000 to 20,000 square feet of space, he said, because bigger Manhattan tenants are sensitive to the labor issue.</p>
        <p>Another complicating factor is the lack of public transit. Unlike Jersey City, with its  PATH train, Bergen County relies mostly on buses to link it directly with Manhattan. There is train service, but only to Hoboken, where passengers must change to PATH trains to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, with the current scarcity of blocks of space of 50,000 square feet or more in Manhattan, ''tenants have to look outside the box,'' said Mr. Konsker of Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Through lease expirations and relocating existing tenants elsewhere in the complex, two blocks, one of 50,000 and the other of 100,000 square feet, are being cobbled together at Continental Plaza. They will be available in the next four to six months, Mr. Konsker said, adding that a total of 50,000 more square feet, made up of smaller spaces, will also be available. Additional leases are coming due in the next 12 to 18 months, he said.</p>
        <p>The landlord is improving the property, which is now almost 30 years old. The wiring in the three buildings is being upgraded for advanced telecommunications, including high-speed Internet access, and the common areas are being renovated. Mr. Gluck  said the complex has its own postal substation, a branch bank and garage parking for 2,500 cars.</p>
        <p>SINCE leasing began three months ago, five leases have been negotiated or closed, Mr. Konsker said. Of those leases, one for 8,500 square feet has been closed with Macromedia Inc., a San Francisco software company with offices in Teaneck. A second lease, for 22,000 square feet, is being negotiated with another New Jersey company. In addition, negotiations are under way with three Manhattan companies, for 20,000 to 60,000 square feet each, he said.  He would not name them.</p>
        <p>Another building in Hackensack that is seeking Manhattan tenants is at 21 Main Street downtown. Bergen County, which uses the entire three-story building for administrative offices, will vacate it by the end of the year, said Jerry L. Barta, the director of leasing and marketing at Alfred Sanzari Enterprises of Hackensack, the owner.</p>
        <p>''We're not marketing exclusively to Manhattan tenants,'' Mr. Barta said, ''but there has been a spillover due to the high rents, so they are one of the obvious suspects to go after, in addition to New Jersey firms which are expanding.'' Given the scarcity of big blocks of space, ''this is not the worst time to get back 160,000 square feet,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Rents have not yet been set at the building, which will be upgraded for advanced telecommunications, but they are expected to be about $30 a square foot. Mr. Barta said his company could also build a 190,000-square-foot building across Essex Street from the existing one, and the two could be linked together to create something of an urban campus.</p>
        <p>In Lyndhurst, a group of Bergen County investors is in contract to buy an empty 131,000-square-foot building at 160 Chubb Avenue, with access to Manhattan via Route 3 and the Lincoln Tunnel. The building recently became vacant after its sole tenant, Ebasco Engineering, terminated its lease in a consolidation by its parent company, Raytheon.</p>
        <p>''It's a classic alternative for New York firms considering the economic advantage of locating in New Jersey,'' said Leonard T. Miller Jr., a senior director at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, which represents the buyers. He said asking rents at the building, which could be expanded by 42,000 square feet, are expected to be $27 to $29 a square foot.</p>
        <p>There are also development plans for new offices in the county. In Rutherford, near Routes 3 and 17, Lincoln Equities is preparing a 28-acre site for 900,000 square feet of office space in two buildings, plus a 220-room hotel. Mr. Babikian of Insignia/EGS  said that Skymark Partners of Hackensack is advancing plans to build two million square feet of offices in three buildings, along with a hotel, on a 33-acre site at Route 46 and the New Jersey Turnpike in Ridgefield Park.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babikian, who represents the developers, said discussions are under way with three prospective tenants, two from Midtown Manhattan. ''The developers want to catch the market and take advantage of their proximity to Manhattan,'' he said, noting that the site is within a 10-minute drive of both the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel.</p>
