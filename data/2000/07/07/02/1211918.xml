        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>This issue goes much deeper than School versus Corporation. It's about corporate intrusion on people's quality of life. What makes Southland think they can come into my residential neighborhood and destroy it with glaring 24-hour lights, traffic, noise and litter? This is a traffic-stressed intersection of two-lane roads, not a major highway. It is in the middle of a wooded, village-type setting.</p>
        <p>Southland is in for a rude awakening. Should it succeed in getting the necessary variances from the pro-development political stooges on some of the township's various boards and committees, it and the township face a class-action lawsuit from members of the three communities affected by this atrocity.</p>
