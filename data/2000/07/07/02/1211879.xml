        <p>When Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist began his announcement that the Supreme Court had upheld its landmark Miranda decision by intoning, ''You have the right to remain silent,'' Americans of a certain age could be forgiven for thinking of Jack Webb.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Webb as the deadpan Sgt. Joe Friday in ''Dragnet,'' who did much to make the routine warning given by police to suspects part of the national culture, which it has become as Justice Rehnquist wrote in his majority opinion.</p>
        <p>When ''Dragnet'' began its last four-year run on prime-time television in 1967, a year after the court's original decision in Miranda v. Arizona, Sergeant Friday and his partner Bill Gannon never missed a chance to rattle it off.</p>
        <p>The rest of Hollywood soon followed suit.</p>
        <p>''It was all part of our catechism, the idea that you have to be legitimate in your arrests and not put them in jeopardy,'' said Herman Saunders, Mr. Webb's friend and a producer of another police series, ''Adam-12,'' which was created by Mr. Webb.  ''Jack was a very, very dogmatic fellow about following the rules all the way.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, as noted in ''Just the Facts, Ma'am,'' an out-of-print biography of Mr. Webb by Daniel Moyer and Eugene Alvarez, the Miranda warning was delivered so frequently that it came close to sounding like self-parody.</p>
        <p>These days, a new generation of fans are enjoying the unintended ironies of ''Dragnet'' on the ''TV Land'' cable channel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saunders thinks that would please his old friend, who died in 1982. But he said that Mr. Webb, who worked so hard to lionize the Los Angeles Police Department, would be appalled by what is perhaps the worst corruption and evidence-tampering scandal in its history, and at the state of criminal justice generally.</p>
        <p>''He'd be horrified,'' Mr. Saunders said. ''He would be just absolutely turning in his grave.''</p>
