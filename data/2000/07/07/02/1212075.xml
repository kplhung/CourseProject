        <p>MALIGNANT SADNESS</p>
        <p>The Anatomy of Depression.</p>

        <p>There was a time when depression (or melancholia, as it was called) was rarely mentioned in public. These days the merits of Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil are debated as often outside medical circles as within. Tony Soprano takes Prozac, and the Marlboro Moment has given way to the Zoloft Day. (''A great day for Dad. A great day for Mom. A terrific day for the family. Make it happen. The Zoloft Saturday.'')</p>
        <p>Two very different books are part of the latest crop of works about depression. Lewis Wolpert, a professor of biology at University College, London, and a noted science writer, chose the title ''Malignant Sadness'' to reflect his conviction that ''normal sadness is to depression what normal growth is to cancer.'' He begins the book with these lines: ''It was the worst experience of my life. More terrible even than watching my wife die of cancer. I am ashamed to admit that my depression felt worse than her death, but it is true.'' That opener encouraged me to curl up with the book, expecting a Styronesque memoir of illness (though ''Darkness Visible'' would be difficult to surpass). What a surprise to encounter instead a textbooklike review of the subject -- well written, but not the kind of book to curl up with.</p>
        <p>The obligatory history-of-depression chapter is followed by one on ''Defining and Diagnosing Depression.'' In the ''Other Cultures'' chapter we learn that in developing countries depression often shows itself in somatic symptoms -- headache, stomach pain, dizziness, weakness -- perhaps because in these cultures it is shameful to admit to emotional distress. In the sections on psychological and biological explanations for depression, Wolpert usefully summarizes the work of important researchers in the field:</p>
        <p>''Freud assumed that all love is ambivalent in depressives+. . .+and that hostility towards the love object is turned inwards. Thus a patient who is depressed is mourning for someone who is consciously or unconsciously believed to be lost.''+ ''Jacobson, for her part, emphasized that loss of self-esteem lay at the core of depression, arguing that during development the child's self-image is constantly changing and it is possible within a loving family to develop an optimal level of self-esteem.''+ ''Seligman suggests depression is thus due to the belief that action is futile, and that nothing can be done to restore the losses linked, for example, to bereavement, financial difficulties or chronic illness.''+ ''According to Beck, depressed patients have cognitive distortions about themselves. These include drawing negative conclusions without any evidence to support them (I failed once, this means I will never be successful').''</p>
        <p>The book is most engaging when Wolpert describes his personal experience. But he does so only reluctantly and with great economy. We learn about a critical event in Wolpert's life almost as an aside: ''It is natural for anyone who gets depressed to want to know the reasons.+. . .+In my own case I am convinced, as I was then, that my depression was due to a drug (flecainide) that I was taking to control my heart arrhythmia.+. . .+My wife, Jill, had a different explanation for my depression. She was convinced that my depression was linked to returning to South Africa, where my father had been murdered some years ago. That did not make sense to me as I had already been back once. Of course I preferred the drug explanation to the psychological one. But the truth may include both.''</p>
        <p>We hear little else about the murder of Wolpert's father or the death of Wolpert's wife. It is these omissions, which in their own way are revealing, that make ''Malignant Sadness'' read like the course material for a graduate seminar: the work of many others is cited, but the author is relatively anonymous. Wolpert seems to have taken to heart the advice given at the end of Burton's ''Anatomy of Melancholy,'' a classic treatise on depression: ''Be not idle.''</p>
        <p>We expect writers of nonfiction -- particularly if it is the kind that requires lots of research -- to have a thesis, a self-assertion that rises from the carrels of a library and elevates the work to another level. If ''Malignant Sadness'' lacks this quality, ''Prozac Backlash'' suffers from too much of it. Joseph Glenmullen is a psychiatrist who is in private practice in Cambridge, Mass. The use of the word ''backlash'' in the title refers to the reactions in the brain that are evoked by Prozac and the other drugs, like Zoloft and Paxil, that act on serotonin. These reactions -- rare but well documented -- include the development of tics and other involuntary movements as well as a Parkinson's-like condition. Much more common are withdrawal syndromes, and the tendency for the drugs' effects to diminish over time.</p>
        <p>Glenmullen uses ''cases,'' a staple of books of this genre, to illustrate these problems. (''Maura: A Case of Disfiguring Tics''; ''Leslie's Amotivational Syndrome''; ''Ming and Cora: Cases of Muscle Spasms''; ''Ron: A Case of Neurologically Driven Agitation''). Fortunately, given the thousands, perhaps millions of people who are on these drugs, the most alarming side effects (like tics and Parkinsonism) are rare. But Glenmullen wants to make more of the risk than his own data supports; his language keeps leaning in the direction of overstatement. For example, he refers to ''reports estimating thousands of cases of these serious side effects.'' In his extensive bibliography, however, one finds reports not of thousands of cases, but of a handful. The estimates are just that, estimates.</p>
        <p>Glenmullen is critical, as are many in medicine, of the excessive popularity of psychopharmacology -- the use of drugs in place of talking through a patient's problem. The mystique of a biochemical imbalance at the root of every symptom has too much allure. ''Psychopharmacology rests on a 'disease model' of psychiatric symptoms,'' he writes. ''But to treat all psychiatric symptoms as though they were exclusively biological is unacceptable reductionism.'' Furthermore, he says, the ''policy of having primary-care doctors treat a significant percentage of mental health patients was facilitated by the introduction of serotonin boosters with their one-dose-fits-all-patients, ease of use, and their broad applicability for dozens of conditions, not just depression.''</p>
        <p>As an alternative to the Prozac type of antidepressants, Glenmullen favors old-fashioned psychotherapy as well as St. John's wort. His strong promotion of St. John's wort is puzzling only because it is in such striking contrast to the rigor with which he prosecutes the Prozac group of drugs. My conversations with academic psychiatrists suggest that St. John's wort is not well studied in this country, though investigations are continuing. Its mechanism of action is uncertain; it is probably better than a placebo and relatively safe. Still, its active ingredients consist of a dozen or more agents, which are found in differing strengths depending on how the dose is prepared, and we know much less about its long-term effects than we do about those of the Prozac group.</p>
        <p>GLENMULLEN'S harshest criticism is reserved for Peter D. Kramer's ''Listening to Prozac'' (though he did not dislike it enough to find an original title for his own book), and it smacks a bit of envy: ''Couched in a barrage of almost senseless data, which unfortunately looked like impregnable science to the lay reader, Kramer's endorsement of the drugs was so sweeping he even described them as making people feel 'better than well.' ''</p>
        <p>That statement pinpoints the very things that are disturbing about Glenmullen's own writing. He might find it instructive to reread ''Listening to Prozac,'' as I did: whether or not we agree with Kramer's opinions, his book is still a model for how a writer can develop an engaging, intimate, reflective and believable style and how a writer can theorize and speculate without proselytizing and thereby losing the reader. Above all it shows how to wield a brush so fine that ''cases'' resemble real people and not talking heads.</p>
