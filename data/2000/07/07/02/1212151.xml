        <p>The Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia, the chain's first new hotel in the United States in almost 10 years, is now open at 10 Avenue of the Arts, occupying two landmark buildings near Independence Hall. Amenities include such innovations as a technology butler to solve problems without charge for laptop-carrying guests and a bath butler to draw one's bath and supply, at extra charge, Champagne and truffles or exotic scents.</p>
        <p>The neo-Classical Girard-Mellon Bank buildings, with a rotunda copied from the Pantheon in Rome and a tower dating from the early 1900's, were designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White. The renovation cost $88 million, giving the hotel 331 rooms, including a 2,100-square-foot penthouse, and 20,000 feet of meeting space, two restaurants and two lounges.</p>

        <p>TRAVEL ADVISORY  Correction:  July 16, 2000, Sunday  A report in the Travel Advisory column on July 2 about the new Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Philadelphia misstated its distance from Independence Hall. It is not near Independence Hall but rather eight blocks away. A caption with the report misstated the nature of work on the hotel. It was under renovation, not under construction.</p>
