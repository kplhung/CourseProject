        <p>IT'S a tall ships weekend all around the metropolitan area. Operation Sail 2000, a gathering of about 150 big sailing ships and three dozen modern warships in New York Harbor, begins tomorrow.

        <p>IT'S a tall ships weekend all around the metropolitan area. Operation Sail 2000, a gathering of about 150 big sailing ships and three dozen modern warships in New York Harbor, begins tomorrow. But if Long Islanders want to see tall ships without have to fight city traffic and crowds, they needn't wait, nor go any farther than Glen Cove or Greenport. And Port Jefferson is scheduled for some stately visitors next weekend.</p>
        <p>The Glen Cove event, called Waterfront Festival 2000, is the largest of the three. It began on Friday, featuring free concerts, food and crafts vendors, puppet shows, face painting and of course, tall ships. The festival is scheduled to conclude tonight with a fireworks display.</p>
        <p>This year's visiting armada includes the Kalmar Nyckel, a 139-foot full-rigged ship from Wilmington, Del.; the Californian, a 95-foot schooner from Long Beach, Calif.; and the Morning Star of Revelation, a 62-foot gaff-rigged sloop from England.</p>
        <p>The John L. Hall, a 453-foot Navy guided missile frigate, will also be in port at Glen Cove. Its officers and crew will serve as judges for a classic car show being held at the festival today. Another featured ship is the Thomas Jefferson, a replica of the side-wheel paddle steamers that once plied the Gold Coast during the 19th century. Harbor tours aboard the Thomas Jefferson will take visitors for a close-up look at many of the ships and are available for $10 for adults and $7 for children.</p>
        <p>Some of the 11 tall ships can be boarded by walking a 400-foot temporary dock that has been built at the Morgan Memorial Park waterfront. City officials are expecting 100,000 people at this weekend's event, which they hope will help showcase Glen Cove's waterfront revitalization program.</p>
        <p>''This festival is a vehicle to reintroduce the people of Long Island to our beautiful waterfront,'' Mayor Tom Suozzi said. A mile of the city's waterfront is a former state and federal superfund site which Mr. Suozzi said is targeted for redevelopment.</p>
        <p>The Mir, a 358-foot sailing ship from the Marine Engineering School in St. Petersburg, Russia, was scheduled to end its four-day visit to Greenport on Friday. Village officials said it was the largest sailing vessel to enter the harbor since the 19th century. The 154-foot Pogoria, the flagship of the Polish Sail Training Association in Gdynia, Poland, is scheduled to remain at the Greenport railroad dock until Monday and is open for public viewing.</p>
        <p>The tall ships bring between 10,000 to 20,000 visitors to Greenport, which has a year-round population of about 2,000, according to Mayor David E. Kapell. And besides the obvious benefits to local shops and restaurants, the mayor said the ships also raise the spirits of village residents.</p>
        <p>''It's very uplifting,'' said Mr. Kapell. ''It's definitely great for business and good for the soul.''</p>
        <p>Port Jefferson will be welcoming two tall ships next week. Next Sunday, the Stella Polare, a 76-foot Italian Navy training vessel, is scheduled to arrive for a two-day stay and dockside tours. On July 12, the Danielle Louise, a 73-foot gaff-rigged schooner, is scheduled to arrive for a five-day visit and will be available for two- and three-hour sails from the Danford's Conference Center dock.</p>
        <p>A sailor for 50 years, Charles Kenny is one of the organizers of the Port Jefferson tall ship visit and is president of the Long Island Seaport and Eco Center, an education resource and restorer of old vessels. ''The tall ships help cultivate an awareness and appreciation of our maritime history,'' Mr. Kenny said. During the 1800's, Port Jefferson was one of the largest wooden shipbuilding centers in the country, Mr. Kenny said.</p>
        <p>Many of the ships that will making port on Long Island are training ships, where young cadets set sail from as far as Europe and California to learn the ropes of life on the high seas. The American Sail Training Association, headquartered in Newport, R.I., is a sponsor and organizer of the tall ship visits. Its executive director, David Wood, said the months at sea within the tight confines of a ship is a strong character builder for the cadets, mostly aged 15 to 25.</p>
        <p>''They learn life skills; self confidence, teamwork, self reliance and perseverance,'' said Mr. Wood.</p>
        <p>And while Long Islanders get to gawk at the majestic schooners, the foreign cadets get a taste of American life. The agenda for the young sailors of the Mir and the Pogoria in Greenport included a dance on Thursday evening at the American Legion Hall and a soccer match yesterday pitting the Pogoria cadets against a local squad at Greenport High School.</p>
        <p>Sasha Khudyakov, 18, from Sevastopol, Ukraine had already visited England, Spain, the Canary Islands and Bermuda before he arrived in the United States, which so far has been his favorite.</p>
        <p>''People greet me everywhere with a smile,'' said the Mir cadet, who is studying ship construction, navigation and English on his six-month tour at sea. Dressed in his work uniform of white pants, long-sleeved white shirt and light blue scarf, the Russian cadet said he has had ''very much fun'' for the first two months of his voyage, and that his biggest purchase here was a Zippo lighter.</p>
        <p>Sail training ships, whether they cruise a harbor for a couple of hours or sail around the world, are usually funded by non-profit agencies or national governments. Although most of the tall ships are replicas of historic designs, many have been built within the past 20 years, costing as much as $10 million, according to Steve Baker, the ASTA race director.</p>
        <p>In something of a rift in the tall ship sorority, the North Shore visitors are not participants in Operation Sail 2000. When OpSail's New York tour ends next weekend, the closest many of its vessels will come to Long Island will be the Sound, as they head for another event in New London, Conn.</p>
        <p>Greg Perrin, a vice president of Opsail Inc., the nonprofit organization sponsoring Operation Sail 2000, said that Glen Cove officials had asked to host some Opsail ships but he didn't want to get involved because Glen Cove was paying ships to visit.</p>
        <p>''We don't pay ships to participate in our events,'' Mr. Perrin said.</p>
        <p>It can cost a municipality anywhere from a couple of thousand dollars to $40,000 to have a tall ship visit for a few days, Mr. Baker said. ''Some cities just want to have a party,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The two tall ship groups are also at odds about a scheduling conflict. The Opsail event for New London will be on the same dates as an ASTA event in Boston later this month.</p>
