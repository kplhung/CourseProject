        <p>STEELY DAN, the enigmatic pop-jazz duo of Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, has not toured to support an album in 26 years. As Mr. Fagen said, a lot of things have changed since then.</p>
        <p>''We have a really good band now and it's fun again,'' he said in a telephone conversation from Chicago, where he, Mr. Becker and a dozen musicians are promoting ''Two Against Nature,'' Steely Dan's first studio album since 1980. ''Back then our band was just kind of thrown together. It wasn't fun.''</p>
        <p>Steely Dan performs tomorrow and Saturday at Jones Beach, Long Island, and on Sunday at Meadows Music Theater in Hartford. Joining Mr. Fagen (keyboards) and Mr. Becker (guitar) on tour are the guitarist Jon Herington, the saxophonists Cornelius Bumpus and Bob Sheppard, the trumpeter Michael Leonhart, the trombonist Jim Pugh, the drummer Ricky Lawson, the bassist Tom Barney, the keyboardist Ted Baker and the background vocalists Victoria Cave, Carolyn Leonhart and Cynthia Calhoun.</p>
        <p>Steely Dan shocked its fans temporarily out of their mid-life crises with its current tour to support ''Two Against Nature.'' The fans had been teased by many false rumors that the band would tour again to support a new release, something it had not done since 1974. Steely Dan sold so many of its first two albums, ''Can't Buy a Thrill'' (1973) and ''Countdown to Ecstacy'' (1974) that they gambled on not having to tour to support a third album.</p>
        <p>''Our label was a little nervous at first,'' said Mr. Fagen, referring to ABC Records, ''but they couldn't say much. We were sick of bus rides, waiting in airports, making no money. All that's changed. Walter and I got this chartered jet.''</p>
        <p>Steely Dan never played by the industry's rules. Besides rarely touring, it never felt the need to write commercial hits, though the group enjoyed chart success with ''Do It Again,'' ''Reelin' in the Years,'' ''Rikki Don't Lose That Number'' and a few others. The jazz-influenced songs of Mr. Fagen and Mr. Becker featured harmonic structures and chord progressions unusually complicated for rock and roll.</p>
        <p>''Popular music bands often fall in the country-blues tradition, like Chuck Berry,'' Mr. Fagen said. ''That's stuff you can learn in your garage. We are more rhythm and blues with bebop harmonies. That doesn't fit into the popular style.''</p>
        <p>Steely Dan also shies away from love songs, preferring to explore  characters like gamblers, assassins and lascivious old men. Many of the Fagen-Becker songs are too nebulous to explain, and Mr. Fagen, the primary lyricist, proved little help. ''That may not be the most fruitful conversation,'' said a deadpan Mr. Fagen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fagen, 52 and Mr. Becker, 50,  grew up listening to the music of their idols, Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington and John Coltrane. They met at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., in 1967 and formed several college bands including the Leather Canary (a fellow Bard student, Chevy Chase, sat in a couple of times).</p>
        <p>After Mr. Fagen graduated in 1969 (Mr. Becker did not graduate), they endured a brief stint as songwriters and a yearlong hitch with the pop band Jay and the Americans. With the release of ''Can't Buy a Thrill'' in October 1972, Steely Dan was on the charts with its singles ''Do It Again'' and ''Reelin' in the Years.''</p>
        <p>Steely Dan's second album, ''Countdown to Ecstasy,'' was recorded between tour stops during 1973. Mr. Fagen and Mr. Becker then swore off touring to focus on writing and recording. The decision only added to the band's mystique as sales increased with the next five albums: ''Pretzel Logic'' (1974), ''Katy Lied'' (1975), ''The Royal Scam'' (1976), ''Aja'' (1977) and ''Gaucho'' (1980). In 1993, Mr. Fagen and Mr. Becker resurrected the Steely Dan name for the first tour in 19 years. Two years later they released ''Alive in America'' from the tapes of those shows. The pair enjoyed live performing enough to write and record the aptly titled ''Two Against Nature.'' Mr. Fagen said that he and Mr. Becker have enough material for another album.</p>
        <p>''When we finish the tour, we'll go back to the studio and finish up the songs we didn't do on this album,'' he said, adding, ''If we still have a band as good as this, we'll tour with that one too.''</p>
        <p>Steely Dan will perform tomorrow and Saturday at Jones Beach. The group performs next Sunday at 7 p.m. at Meadows Music Theater in Hartford. Tickets range from $25 to $75. The number to call for information is (860) 422-0000 or visit the Web sites, www.meadowsmusic.com or www.steelydan.com.</p>
