        <p>PEOPLE ask her why, at 38, she is still out there, on the road, a different tour stop every night, chasing a dream she has already lived. Dr. Dot Richardson can answer only that she still has the passion and she earned the opportunity and because a game not measured by time is preferable to waiting around for hers to be up.</p>
        <p>''It's not forever,'' she said. ''Every moment of our lives we truly need to live.''</p>
        <p>What sounded like the inside of a fortune cookie was actually more the voice of traumatic experience. When she is not winding her way along the Olympic softball trail, Richardson is a surgeon and thus not unfamiliar with mortality's terms. She just didn't expect to be confronting them while warming up recently at second base.</p>
        <p>Richardson was my favorite Atlanta Olympian in 1996, the freckled and chatty shortstop who invited the world to come watch the United States women do their thing at the isolated outpost of Columbus, Ga. She also hit the game-winning home run against China which gave the Americans the first Olympic gold medal in women's softball, a splendid game requiring abundant levels of athletic skill.</p>
        <p>She wanted to be an ambassador for her sport, which she had played internationally since 1979 and at U.C.L.A. and throughout medical school and her residency years. And though none of the Olympic softball games were televised, the buzz from Columbus was so strong that the network geniuses back in New York finally broke down. They stole a few moments from the gymnastic pixies, and let Dr. Dot and teammates rap live with Bob Costas on the night they struck gold.</p>
        <p>''After Atlanta, I felt that I never wanted to step on a field again,'' she said last Thursday when the national team, on the long road to Sydney, stopped by in Staten Island to play a college all-star team. ''It was like I never wanted to taint those memories.''</p>
        <p>Four years is a long time to stick to an emotional decision. By the following year, Richardson was convincing herself there was no harm in returning to Columbus for an encore. She wanted to say thank you to the fans, relive the moments. The plan would have been perfect had she not tried out for the United States team, and been cut.</p>
        <p>Shortstop had become the undisputed territory of Crystl Bustos, a strapping 23-year-old slugger. Richardson, at 5 feet 5 inches, felt they were telling her the game had outgrown her, that she was too old. That made her mad enough to try out again.</p>
        <p>She had a 10 a.m. flight to San Diego from Los Angeles, where she lives, for the next national team auditions. After being up at the hospital all night, she missed the flight, tending to a patient. Now she had a choice: give it up for good and go home to sleep, or drive the two hours and try out, exhausted.</p>
        <p>''I remember driving and thinking about how they say athletes never know when to get out,'' she said. ''I was saying, 'God, give me a sign.' ''</p>
        <p>She got cut again, and decided that wasn't the sign.</p>
        <p>''The thing I took from San Diego,'' she said, ''was that while I was on the field, I was thinking: 'I just love this. I want to play.' ''</p>
        <p>Richardson kept trying and, finally, last year, she remade the national team, at second base. The Americans rolled into Staten Island, not having lost since a 2-1 preliminary round defeat to Australia at the 1998 world championships. On the current tour, after 13 of 32 stops, they had outscored the opposition, 154-1.</p>
        <p>Before hitting the road, Richardson completed a fellowship with the Kerlan-Jobe Institute, and she plans to start her own practice in sports orthopedics next year. Medical duties were on hold, until the second inning Thursday night at the A.S.A. complex in Staten Island. When she saw the commotion by the bleachers behind first base, when she noticed her team manager, Ralph Weekly, frantically waving her over, she knew why. She dropped her glove and sprinted off.</p>
        <p>She had treated diabetics at games before. She performed a Heimlich maneuver once. But this time, a 70-year-old man, Sal Lamendola, had gone into cardiac arrest. He lost consciousness and Richardson started cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p>
        <p>''He needs to go to a hospital,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In an emergency medical van, she began chest compressions. She checked for a pulse and found none. Soon, the van was pulling over, intercepted by an ambulance, which soon sped off with the patient. Richardson, in uniform, was in the street, in a daze.</p>
        <p>''I was so stressed, working so hard, and it felt as if we had driven for miles,'' she said. ''I said to someone, 'Where's the field?' He said, 'Right over there.' ''</p>
        <p>She walked around the corner, into the dugout. The coach, Ralph Raymond, asked if she wanted to play. Why not? she replied. She grabbed a bat and went up to hit.</p>
        <p>After the game, Richardson learned that Sal Lamendola had died at the Sisters of Charity Medical Center. She didn't know the man. She just tried to save him. She had heard that he often umpired softball games at the complex and that his life had ended watching his favorite sport, doing something he loved.</p>
        <p>''That's the best we can do while we're here,'' said the good doctor and softball philosopher. ''Things that we love.''</p>
