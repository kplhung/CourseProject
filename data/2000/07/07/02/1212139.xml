        <p>FOUR years ago, Brandon Tartikoff, the legendary NBC programming chief, proposed the Hollywood equivalent of building oneself a pyramid: a television series based on his own life.

        <p>FOUR years ago, Brandon Tartikoff, the legendary NBC programming chief, proposed the Hollywood equivalent of building oneself a pyramid: a television series based on his own life. The former network president, who had overseen such hits as ''Cheers,''  ''Seinfeld'' and ''Law and Order'' during his decadelong tenure at NBC, felt the time was right for a prime-time version of ''Network,'' the 1976 Oscar-nominated satire of the television news business.</p>
        <p>''Brandon realized people were spending more time watching TV than any other single activity with the exception of doing their own jobs,'' says Jerry Offsay, president of programming at Showtime Networks, which bought Mr. Tartikoff's proposal. ''He felt audiences had a new interest in the twists and turns behind running a network.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Tartikoff, who died of Hodgkin's disease in 1997, did not live to see his series reach the air, Showtime's ''Beggars and Choosers,'' an hour comedy about the embattled president of a fictional flagging network, reflects his vision. When the series (which began its second season this past week) had its premiere last year, critics hailed it as an intelligent, smartly written adult ''dramedy'' -- the first series since HBO's comedy ''The Larry Sanders Show'' to take a satirical behind-the-scenes look at the television industry.</p>
        <p>''Brandon wanted to go beyond 'Larry Sanders,' '' says the executive producer of ''Beggars and Choosers,'' Peter Lefcourt, who developed the series with Mr. Tartikoff. ''He wanted to do 'Network' for the 90's and examine the whole landscape of TV programming.''</p>
        <p>''Beggars and Choosers'' -- the title refers to the buyers and sellers in the television market -- is the story of Rob Malone (Brian Kerwin), an earnest if beleaguered network president not unlike Mr. Tartikoff. In charge of programming for the faltering fourth-place LGT network, Malone has a glamorous socialite wife, Cecile (Isabella Hoffman), not unlike Mr. Tartikoff's widow, Lily, who serves as a producer on the series; two precocious children and a pressure-cooker job where he battles doublecrossing agents, demanding stars and egotistical producers as well as his own not-to-be-trusted staff, headed by his back-stabbing development head, Lori Volpone (Charlotte Ross), modeled on the exploitive programmer played by Faye Dunaway in ''Network.''</p>
        <p>Last season, Malone fought off sagging ratings by airing the controversial ''Mountainmen,'' a ''Survivor''-like smash about a group of vigilante wilderness-dwellers that stirred protest among African-Americans and feminists demanding the inclusion of Mountainblackmen and Mountainwomen. This season, Malone confronts the network's eccentric new owners, a brash dot.com billionaire, played by Beau Bridges, and his hard-partying nephew, played by Jim Belushi.</p>
        <p>If these sound like plot lines ripped from the headlines, the dialogue on the series is equally up to the minute. Episodes are rife with offhand references to the overnights -- Malone wakes every day to hear the overnight Nielsen ratings -- option year, MOW and 22-episode guarantee. Such inside-baseball terms would have been beyond the understanding of viewers of ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' 40 years ago, when TV-industry verisimilitude extended only as far as a late-night sketch-writing session or a trip to the woodshed with the dyspeptic producer, Alan Brady.</p>
        <p>''This is the only series I've worked on where we don't need a technical adviser,'' says Mr. Lefcourt, a novelist (his works include ''The Deal,'' a black comedy about Hollywood that he referred to as a ''cult hit'') and an Emmy-award winning producer whose credits include ''Cagney and Lacey'' and ''Our Family Honor.''  ''Not only do we all know this world, but we don't have to explain things like Nielsen ratings for the audience. Everyone just gets it.''</p>
        <p>Bombarded by entertainment news, viewers today are increasingly hip to Hollywood's ways, and box-office grosses, Nielsen ratings and even the ''Friends'' contract renegotiation are water-cooler topics. Now, prime-time producers are getting in on the act.</p>
        <p>''Audiences are much more media savvy today,'' Mr. Lefcourt said. ''We've also reached the saturation point with medical and legal shows. The television industry offers a rich body of new stories that have so far been untapped because of a fear that audiences don't want to demythologize Hollywood. But that's changing.''</p>
        <p>In fact, TV series about TV have been around since the industry began. From ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' in the 1960's to ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' in the 1970's to ''Murphy Brown'' in the 1980's, such series have been a consistent if lesser part of the prime-time landscape. Now, fueled by the newly media-savvy audiences as well as the explosive growth of the cable industry, the genre seems to be picking up steam. From ''Beggars and Choosers'' to NBC's new teen drama, ''M.Y.O.B.'' (which is rife with insider references to series like ''Friends'' and ''Law and Order''), as well as the recently canceled comedy ''Sports Night'' and last season's ''Action,'' the number of series set in the entertainment industry is increasing. The trend even extends to children's programming, with the Disney Channel drama ''The Famous Jett Jackson,'' about a 15-year-old TV star who leaves Hollywood and moves to rural North Carolina in order to lead a normal life. This fall ''Grosse Pointe'' will have its debut on the fledgling WB network. A parody of the long-running teen soap ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' it is expected to be the most visible of these entertainment-based shows.</p>
        <p>''My idea was to do a teenaged 'Larry Sanders,' because there's a level of subversive humor that audiences will understand today,'' said Darren Star, the creator of ''Grosse Pointe'' as well as ''Beverly Hills 90210'' and ''Melrose Place.''</p>
        <p>''The idea of being in on it, of offering viewers a behind-the-scenes look at these entertainment worlds, is very popular now,'' added Stacey Lynn Koerner, vice president for broadcast research at TN Media, the media-buying arm of True North Communications. ''Whether it's 'Murphy Brown' or 'Sports Night' or 'Grosse Pointe,' audiences like to feel they're on the inside.''</p>
        <p>With its topicality and insider's tone, ''Beggars and Choosers'' has helped lead the charge. Already it's become the flagship series for Showtime, as ''The Larry Sanders Show'' did at HBO in 1992. ''It's the best series we've put on the air,'' said Mr. Offsay, who adds that the show has earned the cable channel new respect within the Hollywood community. ''Agents are now sending us producers and series that they never would have sent us before.''</p>
        <p>DESPITE its success with critics, ''Beggars and Choosers,'' like the majority of series about television, has yet to become a break-out hit. ''The Larry Sanders Show'' never lured significant audiences to HBO notwithstanding its critical accolades and numerous Emmy nominations.</p>
        <p>ABC's ''Hiller and Diller,'' a 1997 sitcom about sitcom writers played by Kevin Nealon and Richard Lewis, was shortlived. Last season, two acclaimed, high-profile comedies about the entertainment industry, ABC's ''Sports Night'' and Fox's ''Action,'' also failed in the ratings. ''Beggars and Choosers'' has generated plenty of buzz but not many viewers. ''It's still a loss leader for Showtime,'' said Mr. Lefcourt, who suggests the series's new time period, on Tuesday evenings, should improve viewership. ''We're getting a lot of attention in the big cities, but we've yet to penetrate the podunks.''</p>
        <p>Despite the sharpened appetite for all things pertaining to Hollywood, questions persist about the broad, popular appeal of series set in the entertainment industry. With their cynical attitudes and frequently disagreeable characters -- epitomized by the narcissistic, egocentric Larry Sanders of Garry Shandling -- such series are still considered risky when it comes to wooing mainstream viewers.</p>
        <p>''Audiences are different today, and because we are a young, new network with primarily a young viewership, we can take these kind of programming risks,'' said Suzanne Daniels, president of entertainment for WB, which will show ''Grosse Pointe.''  ''But even so, I was initially very skeptical about this kind of satirical comedy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Offsay of Showtime said: ''Shows about cops, doctors and lawyers still have one big advantage over shows about television: they deal with real life-and-death issues. You only have to compare Jimmy Smits dying on 'N.Y.P.D. Blue' with a story line about an actress who might not get a role to understand why traditional dramas still succeed.''</p>
        <p>The few TV-based comedies that have become long-running network hits all featured likable main characters whose appeal transcended their setting. Rob Petrie was a talented sitcom writer who was also a devoted family man. Mary Richards was an ambitious TV producer who remained the girl next door. Murphy Brown was an egotistical TV anchor who possessed unimpeachable journalistic ethics.</p>
        <p>''If the context is the only focus, these kind of series are doomed to failure,'' said Stu Bloomberg, entertainment co-chairman of ABC. ''Ultimately you have to have characters, like a Mary Tyler Moore, who will draw audiences in.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Koerner cautioned: '' 'Frasier' is set in a radio station, but that's not why it's a hit. And people still like to have a fantasy vision of Hollywood, not a cynical one.''</p>
        <p>It's a lesson ''Beggars and Choosers'' has learned. The network president Rob Malone may work in a Machiavellian world and he may even play the game, but he is also a decent man who strives to broadcast high-quality programming. He is nicer than the business he's in.</p>
        <p>''We wanted a more centered character than Larry Sanders,'' Mr. Lefcourt said. ''So even though Rob Malone is surrounded by backstabbers, he has a moral purchase and the audience can identify with him.''</p>
        <p>Yet even with that concession, the fact remains that Mr. Tartikoff's series about a network president is on a cable channel rather than a broadcast network. ''Cable is still the only arena where you can do this kind of satirical comedy,'' Mr. Lefcourt said. ''Networks cannot yet bite the hand that feeds them.''</p>
