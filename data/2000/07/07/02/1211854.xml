        <p>WHEN a busload of diner owners and enthusiasts from the fourth annual Diner-Rama conference descended on the Seaplane Diner here last Sunday, Bob Arena, a 61-year-old New Englander who has run the place for 25 years, was prepared.</p>
        <p>The lunch crowd had barely sat down before the Seaplane's four-person staff began producing specials like baked scrod, gravy-laden hamburger plates and mayo-heavy tuna -- each less than $5. But while the portions were generous and their prices right, the diner business rarely makes owners feel as good as their customers.</p>
        <p>In fact, the rewards of running a diner are often more sentimental than financial. Owners go into the business because they envision a career where the whole family can work together, or they want to restore a vintage building to its former glory, or they want to run the small place that has served  comfort food to locals on Main Street since before anyone can remember.</p>
        <p>''The money you make? It pays the bills and if you have any left over, well, you're lucky,'' Mr. Arena said. It took a decade of 90-hour weeks before he began bringing home the $35,000 to $40,000 he makes in a good year. Mr. Arena still counts himself lucky: the diner he bought for $95,000 back in 1975 made it through those tough times and he is still in business.</p>
        <p>But, as his own story implies, the diner owner, the quintessential American small-business person, is becoming an endangered species. Owners underestimate the costs of  restoring their buildings, including rewiring and updating to meet zoning codes. They overestimate how much money they can make from low-cost meals and tables that in many cases seat fewer than 40. The fast-food and family restaurant chains have lured many of their customers away.</p>
        <p>Daniel Zilka, a professional diner restorer who coordinated the conference, estimates that 6,000 of these restaurants were built between 1905 and 1965. Only 2,500 remain, he says. Since 1983, the National Register of Historic Places has added 18 diners to its list.</p>
        <p>To raise awareness about the diner's role in history, Mr. Zilka organized Diner-Rama, which meets in a different region each year. The event last weekend attracted 75 people, ranging from a half-dozen diner owners to recreational food buffs and a sales executive who is considering buying a diner and moving it to Northern California.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zilka also began curating the American Diner Museum, which opens here in 2003 as part of the Heritage Harbor waterfront complex. The museum has been designated a Smithsonian affiliate, and construction began last week. To date, 10 diners have been donated to the museum, with two already moved to the museum grounds.</p>
        <p>Randy Garbin, founder and editor of Roadside, a Worcester, Mass.-based magazine for diner enthusiasts, estimates that owners need to start with at least $750,000 for restoration and, if necessary, relocation. He says that as many as one-third of all  owners, especially the newcomers, aren't  making a profit. Rather than trying to accumulate diners, owners typically sell and  look for another one to restore and operate.</p>
        <p>CHAINS have given the family-owned diner more competition, which Denny's is carrying to a new level by pursuing its own nostalgic theme. Last year, the company spent $200,000 to $300,000 each converting 140 of its 1,784 restaurants into what it calls Denny's Diners.</p>
        <p>Denny's also bought 44 restaurants last year from Starlite Manufacturing of Ormond Beach, Fla., one of the few remaining  diner manufacturers. This year, Denny's is building 20 restaurants from a second diner blueprint done in-house.</p>
        <p>While Denny's revenue per restaurant increased by 2.4 percent last year, the diner-style restaurants gained 8 percent. ''By creating an environment that's fun and different from a typical Denny's, we've attracted younger customers,'' said Jon Jameson, the company's chief strategy officer.</p>
        <p>The Diner-Rama crowd at the Seaplane was not about to stop by a Denny's instead.  Mr. Arena has managed to keep the building, manufactured in 1952 by the Jerry O'Mahony Company, gleaming. One waitress has worked with him for 25 years, and his kitchen prides itself on blueberry pancakes and a snail salad, developed at a regular's request.</p>
        <p>But to stay afloat, the Seaplane has had to move with the times. Since the supper crowd was small, Mr. Arena shut down for dinner and sold his liquor license. The diner  reopens from midnight to 4 a.m. to cater to customers leaving nearby clubs.</p>
        <p>Responding to local demographics -- and finding attractions beyond food -- are crucial. Jerry Berta, one of the conference speakers, bought his first diner, the Diner Store, now in Grand Rapids, Mich., as a gallery and store for his neon-lit sculptures of diners and other images from the 1950's.</p>
        <p>After passers-by kept stopping in to ask for food, he bought the Rosie's Diner once used as a setting for Bounty paper towel commercials and moved it to his lot in 1991 to serve meals. He turned it to face the west, where it would catch the sunset and lure motorists. His 92-seater, profitable at its launch, brought in $1 million last year, better than average for a large diner.</p>
        <p>Other diner owners encourage their customers to become a community. The Red Arrow in Manchester, N.H., a 36-seater owned by Carol Lawrence, who attended the conference, publishes a newsletter about her customers and staff. Her diner, 78 years old, had $1 million in revenues last year, benefiting from staying open around the clock. It gets an extra dose of attention every four years during the New Hampshire primary campaign. Vice President Al Gore used it last winter for a stump speech.</p>
        <p>Not all attention-getting efforts improve the business. Celeste and Phil Paleologos, conference speakers who run the Shawmut Diner in New Bedford, Mass., began operating a radio talk show three years ago from an enclosed booth in the restaurant. The show, however, has not significantly raised  its $400,000 in revenue. Finding employees, meanwhile, has become increasingly difficult; she has canceled two family vacations in recent years because of the shortage of help. And her three children probably will not take over the business. ''I think about selling this place everyday,'' she said.</p>
        <p>SOME conference attendees persist despite failure. Gordon Tindall, 52, bought the Clarksville Diner, in the New Jersey town of that name, for $3,000 in 1988. He restored the diner by hand, even securing its place on the National Register of Historic Places. He moved it to Decorah, Iowa, a college town of 8,000, and opened it  in 1992.</p>
        <p>''I was naive enough to think that if you had good food and good wait staff and kept it clean it would catch on,'' he said. His wife joined him in working 84-hour weeks, but their marriage dissolved under the strain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tindall moved into a cramped basement under the diner and continued for a few more years before acknowledging defeat. In 1998, he sold the diner to a French television station that shipped it abroad.  ''There were a lot of $300 days,'' he recalled. ''That's not much when you have a 14-hour workday.''</p>
        <p>But then he bought another diner, which he is now restoring and then plans to sell. He still aspires to operate one.</p>
        <p>It's a process, he says, that defies logic. ''My advice to anyone who wants to get into this business is: 'Don't ask too many questions. Just do it.' ''</p>
