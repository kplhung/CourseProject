        <p>A new waterfront esplanade along the East River?</p>
        <p>Some residents see it as a possibility when the state renovates part of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive beginning next year and engineers build a temporary floating highway along the river from 53rd to 62nd Streets.</p>
        <p>The state says that will not happen, but residents and politicians are demanding some kind of access on that stretch of river along with the highway project as part of the long-promised ''emerald necklace'' of parkland that is eventually supposed to encircle Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Last month, Community Board 6 approved a resolution urging the State Department of Transportation, which will rebuild the deteriorated section of highway, to include ''some form of waterfront esplanade that considers community concerns.''</p>
        <p>''We do badly need waterfront access in this area,'' said Carol Pieper, the board's district manager. She added that the City Planning Department and the New York City Economic Development Corporation  had a long-stated-goal of ringing Manhattan with a seamless pedestrian and bicycle route along the waterfront. There are now many gaps along the East River, including the area in question.</p>
        <p>The state will begin building two lanes of highway for northbound traffic on the river in 2001 so work can begin on the highway, which is capped by a overhanging structure that is leaking and needs repair, said Alex Dudley, a spokesman for the State Department of Transportation. The floating highway will be used for northbound traffic, and the existing northbound lanes will be used for southbound traffic to permit repair of the current southbound lanes.</p>
        <p>Some community leaders think that when it is time to remove the temporary highway, many people will ask why it cannot stay.</p>
        <p>''Personally, I'd love to see an esplanade, but not everyone agrees,'' said Mary Clare Bergin, president of Sutton Area Committee. She said residents of the east side of Sutton Place, directly over the river, opposed an esplanade for privacy reasons.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis said he doubted that the temporary roadway would become permanent, ''though it would be the best of all possible worlds.''</p>
        <p>''But you never know,'' he said. ''Many so-called temporary things, like community gardens, have become permanent fixtures after turning into a cause celebre.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dudley said the Coast Guard and other agencies would issue permits only under the condition that the roadway be temporary, adding that it would create environmental and navigation safety hazards.</p>
        <p>''One day, we could possibly build an esplanade there,'' Mr. Dudley said. ''But for now, it will have to be the clasp in the emerald necklace.''</p>
