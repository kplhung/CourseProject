        <p>Molly Elissa Rauch, the daughter of Betty and Michael H. Rauch of New York, is to be married today to Benjamin Hoyt Longstreth, a son of Clara and Bevis Longstreth of New York. Rabbi Sarah Reines is to officiate in Bear Mountain State Park on Iona Island, a bird sanctuary on the Hudson River, near Peekskill, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The couple met in 1990 at Williams College, from which they graduated. Next month the bride, 28, will begin studying for a master's degree in public health at Columbia University, where the bridegroom, 29, will be entering his second year of law school.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rauch, who will keep her name, was the health policy analyst at the Mount Sinai Center for Children's Health and the Environment in New York until mid-June. Her father is a managing partner of the New York law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson. Her mother is a marketing and communications consultant and a director of the Fortune Society, the self-help program for ex-convicts in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Longstreth is a summer intern in the State Attorney General's Bureau of the Environment in New York. His mother is the conductor and the music director of the New Amsterdam Singers in New York. His father, who retired as a partner in the New York law firm of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, is the chairman of Symphony Space and a trustee of the Nathan Cummings Foundation and of New School University.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rauch and Mr. Longstreth were engaged last summer on vacation in the Provence region of France, not with a dramatic proposal and a presentation of a ring, but instead through a conversation about the turns their relationship had taken. ''We just decided that we were ready,'' Ms. Rauch remembers.</p>
        <p>While the pair are involved in the relatively conventional pursuit of graduate degrees, some other activities set them apart from the urban mainstream. For instance, the bridegroom has been a leader of an effort to restore oyster beds to New York harbor, a project of Baykeeper, which seeks to improve the harbor waters. Ms. Rauch is a volunteer tutor in New York for Literacy Partners. In their home they eschew air-conditioning and television; out of doors they revel in pursuits that most urban dwellers wouldn't contemplate, such as swimming in the Hudson River on hot summer days.</p>
        <p>They say they are dedicating their careers and lives to ensuring that others can enjoy what they have discovered, whether it be clean water or good health. ''That's a very important part of our relationship,'' Ms. Rauch said. ''And being able to laugh together is a gift that's going to last forever.''</p>
