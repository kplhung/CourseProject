        <p>In a move to build as many as 200 low-cost houses in Huntington Town, two officials have proposed a law that would require builders seeking residential zoning changes to sell 20 percent of the planned units for $120,000 to $125,000.</p>
        <p>The proposal, put forth by Supervisor Frank P. Petrone and the town board's majority leader, Steve Israel, is to be the subject of a public hearing on July 11 and could be enacted as early as Aug. 29. It is intended to meet the growing need for housing by young working people and by older residents, according to a legislative aide, Lisa Broughton.</p>

        <p>In a move to build as many as 200 low-cost houses in Huntington Town, two officials have proposed a law that would require builders seeking residential zoning changes to sell 20 percent of the planned units for $120,000 to $125,000.</p>
        <p>The proposal, put forth by Supervisor Frank P. Petrone and the town board's majority leader, Steve Israel, is to be the subject of a public hearing on July 11 and could be enacted as early as Aug. 29. It is intended to meet the growing need for housing by young working people and by older residents, according to a legislative aide, Lisa Broughton.</p>
        <p>She said a family of four with an income of no more than $61,000 would be eligible to buy the homes.</p>
        <p>Builders would have an option of setting aside only 10 percent of their development, provided they paid a bounty of $75,000 to $200,000 per unbuilt unit, depending on the size of the plot, Ms. Broughton said. The money would be placed into a trust fund to promote the construction of low-cost housing elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Asked about those who argue that the affordable homes should be available mainly to those earning $20,000 or less, Joseph A. DeVincent, the town's director of community development, said such a move would be impractical.</p>
        <p>''To accommodate someone making $20,000, such houses would have to be sold for at least $50,000 below their cost,'' he said. ''The town doesn't have it within its power to provide enough incentives for developers to do that.''</p>
