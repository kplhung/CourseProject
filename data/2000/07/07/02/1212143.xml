        <p>BEFORE they became the premier post-modernists of pop movies, before they were anointed filmdom's foremost fabulists, before critics christened them the Rubik's Cubists of American cinema, Joel and Ethan Coen were merry college pranksters.</p>
        <p>Elder brother Joel studied film at New York University. Ethan the Younger majored in philosophy at Princeton, where he took a year off without bothering to notify the registrar. When he was ready to resume his studies, Ethan wrote to his dean explaining that he had been in a hunting accident in his brother-in-law's living room, and that his left arm had been blown off.</p>
        <p>The dean replied sympathetically, requesting that a physician send along a note stating that Ethan had recovered enough to attend classes.</p>
        <p>A few days later, the dean received a letter from the Rev. Doctor Samson Gaziorwitz of the Our Lady of the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gaziorwitz suggested that since Ethan's legs had been blown off, too, his classrooms should be close together. ''Young Ethan should be shielded from the taunts of fellow students,'' the reverend doctor advised. ''He has become quite adept at wielding his hooks.''</p>
        <p>The dean, having caught on, scheduled an immediate visit to the school psychiatrist, who offered Ethan a choice of diagnoses ranging from manic depression to paranoid schizophrenia. Ethan declined them all. Joel told him he should confound the shrink by rushing back to his dorm room and hanging himself. He counseled, ''Leave a note: 'I sought help, but none was offered.' ''</p>
        <p>The same macabre put-on artistry infected the Coens' 1984 film debut, ''Blood Simple,'' a gothic thriller that will be re-released in a ''director's cut'' on Friday. Made before they turned 30, ''Blood Simple'' is the first of the eight films the brothers have made together. They collaborate as closely as Chang and Eng, so it's hard to tell where Joel's direction starts and Ethan's writing ends.</p>
        <p>Their irrepressibly playful style subverts movie conventions and audience expectations, just as Ethan tweaked the dean at Princeton. Coen films are intricate, unnerving fables that deny moviegoers the conventional clues about where the story goes next. The brothers take well-worn film genres and reinvent them, like Robert Venturi redoing an art museum.</p>
        <p>The cold precision of their planning leaves some viewers complaining that their films are smart but bloodless. Critics carp that the Coens seem to be master machinists whose technical expertise disguises any heart or emotion. They grouse that the Coens make movies to please only themselves.</p>
        <p>Which is probably true. ''Raising Arizona'' (1987) and ''Fargo'' (1996) have been their only box office successes. But the Coens have a cult following, especially among university film scholars. (The Coens' parents are both college professors in Minneapolis). Relentlessly analyzed, ''Barton Fink'' (1991) is a film that launched a thousand theses. The story of a Clifford Odets-like playwright who gets writer's block in Hollywood when he's asked to churn out Wallace Beery wrestling films, the movie is so fraught with ambiguities that any thesis can be defended.</p>
        <p>''In retrospect,'' Joel says, ''it seems like we were teasing the animals at the zoo.''</p>
        <p>''Blood Simple'' evoked an equal number of dissertations and disquisitions, which perplexed the filmmakers with such arcane observations as ''the Coens offer a compelling analysis of mauvaise foi in the Sartrean vein.''</p>
        <p>The brothers are endlessly amused that ''Blood Simple'' has been credited with inside jokes and homages involving writers they had never read and film noir classics they had never seen. ''When we read the books we were supposed to have read----'' says Joel, ''----we came up with new ideas for movies,'' says Ethan. The Coens not only think alike, they talk alike. They begin and finish each other's sentences.</p>
        <p>Behind all their movies lurks some literary or cinematic model. The tone and storytelling style of ''Blood Simple'' was borrowed from the hardboiled novels of James M. Cain. For the title, they appropriated Dashiell Hammett's term for the panic that grips the murderer after the crime.</p>
        <p>Set in a low-down Texas of the mind, ''Blood Simple'' is more whydunit than whodunit, a creepy menage a quatre with a horrific logic all its own. The complex intrigue involves double- and triple-crosses, shifting loyalties, a premature burial, impalement and a pinwheeling series of missteps that culminate in a roundelay of murder.</p>
        <p>What sets ''Blood Simple'' into motion is marital infidelity. The owner of the Neon Boot saloon (Dan Hedaya) hires a seedy detective (the great M. Emmet Walsh in a leisure suit the color of ballpark mustard), first to spy on his wife (Frances McDormand), then to bump off her and her lover (John Getz).</p>
        <p>Instead, the private eye pockets the fee, shoots the bar owner and frames the cuckolding couple.</p>
        <p>From there, the plot turns somersaults, then zigzags off into what always seems to be the wrong direction. No characters are aware of the web into which the Coens are spinning them. ''What we liked about the story is that the characters don't know what's going on----'' says Ethan (or Joel), ''----yet the audience does, every step of the way,'' says Joel (or Ethan).</p>
        <p>The script of ''Blood Simple'' is spare and cynical. Barbs, allusions and running gags are held in more or less perfect control. This director's cut actually trims five minutes from the original theatrical release.</p>
        <p>''The whole editing experience was weird,'' Joel says. ''We limited ourselves to the footage we used in the original. It was kind of an interesting exercise, like a puzzle.'' The Coens in effect have re-edited for a tighter, more suspenseful picture.</p>
        <p>They shared the original editing with Roderick Jaynes, who is also credited as a co-editor on ''Barton Fink,''  ''Fargo'' and ''The Big Lebowski'' (1998). Jaynes is also the author of the introduction to the published screenplays of ''Barton Fink'' and ''Miller's Crossing'' (1990), lambasting the Coens' ''inept'' scripts and the ''silliness'' of their cinematography.</p>
        <p>The Coens, in fact, invented the gassy Mr. Jaynes, just as Ethan made up the Rev. Doctor Samson Gaziorwitz. Mr. Jaynes was nominated for an Oscar for ''Fargo,'' but Variety outed him as a Coen creation. ''He did win a British Academy Award,'' Joel says. ''He was invited to join the British film academy, so we enrolled him.''</p>
        <p>The Coens made ''Blood Simple'' with the $1.5 million they raised in Minneapolis. They knocked on doors for about a year and a half with a screenplay and a two-minute teaser. ''Why should I invest in this movie?'' asked one potential investor.</p>
        <p>Joel replied: ''If you don't, someone else will have to.''</p>
        <p>But this is not one of those independent films cobbled together with second-hand furniture, costumes from Goodwill, and camera work by your Cousin Steve.</p>
        <p>''The Coens weren't afraid to gamble a little money to give their film a look,'' says the Pennsylvania filmmaker Mark Moskowitz, who is working on his first independent feature, ''Stone Reader.'' ''And it was that look -- the same top cinematography and glossy look that any Hollywood film had -- that helped 'Blood Simple' find a distributor who would take the Coens seriously. After 'Blood Simple,' production companies around the country realized you didn't need to be in Hollywood to come up with Hollywood production values.''</p>
        <p>Fanciful touches that Ethan calls ''stylistic burps'' pop up everywhere. Joel's camera tracks down a long bar and hops over a passed-out drunk in its path. A newspaper whacking against a glass door punctuates a scene like a gunshot. The burps echo through the Coens' oeuvre to ''The Big Lebowski,'' where one point of view is a bowling ball rumbling toward the pins.</p>
        <p>EVEN though ''Blood Simple'' is five minutes shorter, the Coens have added an introduction. The film now opens in the book-lined study of Mortimer Young, a goggle-eyed, pipe-smoking film preservationist who calls the work ''an exquisite masterpiece'' and assures us it has been ''digitally swabbed, the boring parts have been taken out and other things (pause) added.'' The original, Mr. Young says, garnered ''universal critical acclaim, shattered box office records and ushered in the era of independent cinema.''</p>
        <p>Which turns out to be another Coen put-on. Young is a Coen brothers concoction, as fake as the tomes in his library.</p>
        <p>''Juvenile!'' is how Joel's wife, Frances McDormand, characterizes these brotherly monkeyshines.</p>
        <p>''Nobody's physically hurting anyone,'' Joel says, sheepishly, ''so I guess it's O.K.''</p>
        <p>''Who knows?'' Ethan says in a mock-professorial manner. ''Maybe in the Balzacian weave of things, Mortimer Young and Roderick Jaynes are related.''</p>
