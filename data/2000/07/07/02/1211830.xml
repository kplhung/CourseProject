        <p>IN May, an old friend came to town on business. We had lunch at the sort of late-80's restaurant that, with its Bisquick biscuits and corn bread and homemade lime soda, used to be called new American, and filled in the narrative blanks of our recent histories; it had been 15 years since we'd seen one another. Afterward, we picked our way through the rubble on North Moore Street, decorous in our polymide rainwear and neat black boots and -- this being a contemporary report -- repaired to my friend's tastefully beige room at the SoHo Grand Hotel to examine her week-old fake breasts.</p>
        <p>''The girls,'' as she called them, were high and hard and absolutely perfect. They were also absolutely riveting, or in any case I was riveted by them: I felt they were giving me the hairy eyeball, like Louise Bourgeois's nipply ''Eyes'' sculpture on the esplanade just below Battery Park City. I went home in a daze, unable to shake the feeling that I'd been stared down by a pair of breasts.</p>

        <p>IN May, an old friend came to town on business. We had lunch at the sort of late-80's restaurant that, with its Bisquick biscuits and corn bread and homemade lime soda, used to be called new American, and filled in the narrative blanks of our recent histories; it had been 15 years since we'd seen one another. Afterward, we picked our way through the rubble on North Moore Street, decorous in our polymide rainwear and neat black boots and -- this being a contemporary report -- repaired to my friend's tastefully beige room at the SoHo Grand Hotel to examine her week-old fake breasts.</p>
        <p>''The girls,'' as she called them, were high and hard and absolutely perfect. They were also absolutely riveting, or in any case I was riveted by them: I felt they were giving me the hairy eyeball, like Louise Bourgeois's nipply ''Eyes'' sculpture on the esplanade just below Battery Park City. I went home in a daze, unable to shake the feeling that I'd been stared down by a pair of breasts.</p>
        <p>''Nuts to you,'' I thought a few days later, strapping on a couple of ounces of silicone and Lycra, the Ultimo bra with ''outplants'' -- just one of many new bras designed to give you a competitive edge, or at least make you feel like the heroine of a Barbara Cartland novel. Implants, who needs 'em?</p>
        <p>Six years ago, when the British-made Wonderbra was introduced in this country, push-up bras accounted for about 3 percent of the $4.6 billion bra business; today that figure is closer to 10 percent. Underwear makers are rolling out push-up bras with the sort of hoo-ha usually reserved for movie openings, and their arrivals in department stores are being attended with the frenzy of a Meet the Beatles tour.</p>
        <p>The Ultimo, $58, sold out on its first day at Saks Fifth Avenue not long ago, thanks to a waiting list with 2,500 names on it. Similar scrambles have attended the debuts of Lily of France's X-Bra, $25, out since February, and Victoria's Secret's Natural Liquid Miracle Bra, also known as the Natural, $48, out since April.</p>
        <p>Last weekend, Warnaco's Nothing But Curves bra, for which the company will be spending $3 million to $4 million on advertising and marketing, went on sale at Macy's for $29. Tomorrow, you will be able to find it at department stores across the country. Its appearance completes a six-month barrage of new push-up bras, each more intricately engineered than the last and sporting more options than a fully loaded Range Rover. Eager to add heft to my own shadow, I took a few out for a test drive.</p>
        <p>THE X-BRA. The arcs, nay, the swoops of the molded-foam X-Bra are nothing short of aerodynamic. Running a finger lightly over one particularly graceful angle -- an ''assist'' in underwear parlance -- I thought of hull speed and the famous winged keel employed by the Australians to wrest the America's Cup away from the United States so many years ago. This is the bra that delivers ''a range of cleavage,'' thanks to a clasp thingummy at your sternum. ''Start loose, and then ramp it up during the day,'' a publicist for Lily of France suggested. '' 'Empowering,' 'fun,' 'playful' -- those are the buzzwords for this product.''</p>
        <p>Underwear makers like to borrow language from other arenas, and so there's a lot of talk of ''empowerment,'' along with ''choice'' and ''flexibility,'' in discussing why push-up bras enjoy so much success.</p>
        <p>''We expect to sell a million X-Bras this year,'' said Eric Wiseman, president of Bestform Intimates, which owns Lily of France. ''That's a phenomenal number. Why is it so successful? It puts a woman in control -- it allows her control over the amount of enhancement she gives herself.''</p>
        <p>I fumbled with the tiny plastic flower tab and went straight to ''ramped'' -- a setting that gently eased as the day waned, like an oh-so-slowly deflating balloon. You could almost hear the faint wheeze of escaping air, and the sound of diminishing returns.</p>
        <p>THE ULTIMO. ''Wear it with a blazer and no shirt, or a sweater,'' encouraged Barbara Lipton, vice president and division merchandising manager of intimate apparel at Saks, ''and let me know how it makes you feel.'' Very breast-heaving, was the answer. I wore a slightly too small button-down shirt, for optimal button-straining, and that romance-novel effect.</p>
        <p>The Ultimo's silicone innards are eerily fleshy. They're supposed to ''settle'' and ''warm'' to your body, an action which, if it occurred, was too subtle for me to discern. The Ultimo was comfy, though.</p>
        <p>''I hear it's a bit cold'' was the disingenuous suggestion of more than a few of the Ultimo's competitors. It's not. I wore the Ultimo on random errands, panting like a Pekingese, enjoying the rise and fall beneath my chin, but I didn't have the stomach to sport it in more familiar surroundings. I worried that someone might think I'd had a little work done.</p>
        <p>Why do women want ''a larger breast effect,'' to use the industry phrase?</p>
        <p>My friend Stephen is fond of saying that all genders aspire to be Jayne Mansfield. An evolutionary psychologist would say that an exaggeration of secondary sex characteristics like breasts is rudimentary mate attraction; a Freudian might diagnose such a bosom-focused culture as being hopelessly mired in its oral stage. Ms. Lipton's analysis was succinct: ''Why do women want cleavage? Because they can have it.''</p>
        <p>THE NATURAL. With annual sales of $2.9 billion, Vickie's Secret  (an industry executive referred to  Victoria's Secret this way, and I couldn't resist repeating it) is a company built on cleavage: 20 percent of its sales are in push-up bras.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the company sells more than half of all padded and push-up bras in the United States. You could argue that the rock star status now afforded to breasts is indebted to that company's marketing efforts. ''We were the first to use supermodels,'' said Monica Mitro, vice president of public relations. ''We even created supermodels, like Heidi Klum.''</p>
        <p>In any case, its Miracle Bra, the American answer to the Wonderbra, has until this year been a category killer. Which brings us to the Natural Liquid Miracle Bra, now selling out by word of mouth only. It's a doppelganger to the Ultimo, with outplants that are a tad less obvious. But the overall effect is still like wearing someone else's breasts, which is a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your temperament.</p>
        <p>Is there such a thing as too many cleavage options? Disentangling the Natural from its sisters the other day, I thought there might be. I was beginning to feel like Mary Smiling, a minor character in ''Cold Comfort Farm'' (Stella Gibbons's 1932 satire of the novels of D. H. Lawrence) whose ''second interest was her collection of brassieres, and her search for the perfect one,'' Gibbons wrote.</p>
        <p>''It was hoped that on her death it would be left to the nation,'' she continued. ''She was an authority on the cut, fit, colour, construction and proper functioning of brassieres; and her friends had learned that her interest, even in moments of extreme emotional or physical distress, could be aroused and her composure restored by the hasty utterance of the phrase: ''I saw a brassiere today, Mary, that would have interested you. . . .''</p>
        <p>NOTHING BUT CURVES. At one end of a vast table in Warnaco's sky-high Park Avenue boardroom, recent push-up bra history was being detailed by company executives. Frank Wolfson, designer for the Warner line, and Gwendolyn M. Widell, senior vice president of merchandise development, played Will and Ariel Durant. ''We'll look at these in the hand first,'' Ms. Widell said, and led me from the Model T, the Wonderbra with its removable pads, to the X-Bra, to the liquid pockets of the Ultimo and the Natural. It was a foggy June morning, and Manhattan looked particularly delicious through the picture windows -- windows whose sheer enormity underscored the fact that underwear is extremely big business.</p>
        <p>''Catch,'' Mr. Wolfson said, suddenly flicking a delicate, black winged carapace at me. Nothing But Curves!</p>
        <p>Then two underwear models profiled the bra for me in red python and Caribbean blue, in khaki and a computer-generated rose print. I was so taken I followed the models back into a dressing room, where we had a long and satisfying discussion about shrinkage, gravity and other matters relating to les belle poitrines, as Aileen Mehle might say.</p>
        <p>I took the bra home and wore it for more than a week. It weighs nothing, and affixes, oddly, somewhere between your heart and your clavicle. I liked it, though, for being not too hooter-y, but rather more organizing, like some sort of Kevlar armor, like a breastplate.</p>
        <p>''Women don't want a lot of encumbrances in their lives,'' Ms. Widell had told me.</p>
