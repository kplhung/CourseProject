He is the author of Block Island Geology, Eastern Long Island Geology, Western Long Island Geology, and co-author of Earth History and Plate Techtonics. Les truly enjoyed sharing his knowledge with others. He also had a passion for sailing and skiing. His unique sense of humor and quick wit was appreciated by all who came to know him.
