        <p>Re: ''To Get There From Here, Wait 20 Years'' [June 25].</p>
        <p>It is truly unfortunate that Long Island transportation planners are not ''thinking out of the box.''</p>
        <p>Cars occupy too much space, make too much noise, use too much fuel and degrade the environment. And the planning process needs to factor in higher fuel prices and a population that is aging.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, mass transit has not solved the problems. The Long Island Rail Road is slow and overcrowded. We have shining new double-decker trains, but the service is still the same: It still takes two hours by train to go from Hampton Bays to Jamaica, much longer than by car (except during rush hours). North/south and feeder service remains abysmal. Travel to airports is by car only.</p>
        <p>Years ago, Robert Moses set objectives for Long Island parkways. The system was built and served the Island well during a period of phenomenal growth. But that solution no longer works, and the Island is too small and congested to continue to rely primarily on its highways.</p>
        <p>High-density transportation systems are needed to replace low-density systems. Mass transit needs to be upgraded -- really upgraded -- to encourage people to change their travel habits. We haven't built anything new in years. All we have done is replace old equipment with equivalent new equipment. That is not upgrading; that is restoring the prior level of service.</p>
        <p>I suggest objectives for 2020 (or sooner) that include these goals:</p>
        <p>*For the L.I.R.R., service into Grand Central Terminal, much faster service and trains at least hourly to Riverhead and Speonk, good connections to LaGuardia and Islip airports and light-rail or bus feeder lines using priority lanes to connect to train stations, especially from the East End to Islip.</p>
        <p>*For LaGuardia, a train spur from Kew Gardens through the subway yards to the northeast. With computers, a single track with a few bypasses should be sufficient, thus minimizing right-of-way requirements.</p>
        <p>*For freight service, scheduled high-speed trains, either containerized or roll on, roll off. Container freight service could be run from Brooklyn and the Bronx to depots at Riverhead, Hicksville or Fresh Pond.</p>
        <p>In the New York region, the history of transit has been, ''Build it and they will use it.'' Pour concrete and it will be used. Well, build mass transit and it too will be used if it is fast, clean and convenient. I prefer to leave the driving to someone else.</p>
