        <p>Angels Shift Crusade To Children and Internet</p>
        <p>The Guardian Angels, once known for patrolling the subways and making citizen arrests, are entering their third decade with several updated programs, including a safety patrol that monitors the Internet,  crime prevention groups for young children and a squad that wears, instead of the trademark red beret, crimson bicycle helmets. Angels are even available in the in-line skater version, in Central Park on weekends.</p>
        <p>When the Guardian Angels began patrolling the Muggers Express (a.k.a. the 4 train) in 1979, they drew the animosity of the transit police and of public officials, who called them vigilantes. Their credibility was hurt when Curtis Sliwa, head of the group, admitted that they had faked several of their crime-fighting exploits, including his kidnapping by three off-duty transit police officers. But Mr. Sliwa, 46, said they had garnered the support of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Police Department in recent years.</p>

        <p>Angels Shift Crusade To Children and Internet</p>
        <p>The Guardian Angels, once known for patrolling the subways and making citizen arrests, are entering their third decade with several updated programs, including a safety patrol that monitors the Internet,  crime prevention groups for young children and a squad that wears, instead of the trademark red beret, crimson bicycle helmets. Angels are even available in the in-line skater version, in Central Park on weekends.</p>
        <p>When the Guardian Angels began patrolling the Muggers Express (a.k.a. the 4 train) in 1979, they drew the animosity of the transit police and of public officials, who called them vigilantes. Their credibility was hurt when Curtis Sliwa, head of the group, admitted that they had faked several of their crime-fighting exploits, including his kidnapping by three off-duty transit police officers. But Mr. Sliwa, 46, said they had garnered the support of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Police Department in recent years.</p>
        <p>Since 1993, calls from the public have centered more on keeping children out of trouble with gangs or drug dealers, Mr. Sliwa said, so the Angels' 150 patrollers are no longer the group's main focus.</p>
        <p>Cyberangels, the group's Web site, puts to work ''a group of highly skilled and highly motivated volunteers over the age of 18, who virtually patrol the Internet looking for child pornography, stalkers, child predators, groups advocating child abuse and pedophilia, hate and bigotry sites and scam artists,'' according to the site,  www.cyberangels.org. In all, 5,000 volunteers work on the site, Mr. Sliwa said.</p>
        <p>Through its Urban Angels program, the group mentors children ages 8 to 15 who are in crisis, teaching them character development and communication skills, and arranging for them to do volunteer work in their communities.</p>
        <p>''Our problem is no longer teens, but kids ages 8 to 15, and what to do to keep them from becoming troublemakers,'' Mr. Sliwa said. ''We could continue with the patrols, but that's not where the need was.''</p>
        <p>The group has branched out, with chapters in Japan, Sweden, England (where an all-woman contingent patrols the Underground) and 28 cities in the United States.</p>
        <p>In Manhattan, Angel recruits are still trained in self-defense and physical conditioning, legal issues, and first aid, including CPR. No alcohol, drugs or weapons are allowed, and a young man in an Angels T-shirt routinely frisks Mr. Sliwa, and others, when they go in to the group's headquarters on Eighth Avenue near 46th Street.</p>
        <p>''People still focus on the adversarial reaction people had to us earlier, and say, 'Are you still vigilantes?' '' Mr. Sliwa said.</p>
        <p>''Clearly we're not,'' he said. ''The cops work with us now.''</p>
        <p>Mob Boss in Pajamas Now in Hospital Prison</p>
        <p>Vincent Gigante, the former boss of the Genovese crime family who used to roam the streets of the Village wearing pajamas and a robe -- trying to show he was mentally incompetent to stand trial, according to prosecutors -- is spending his days in a hospital prison in Fort Worth, Tex., said one of his lawyers, Michael Marinaccio.</p>
        <p>''He's been there for several months now,'' Mr. Marinaccio said. ''He has the same health problems he always had.'' They include a heart condition, requiring two open heart surgeries, plus mental health problems.</p>
        <p>''The state of his physical health has always been frail, plus he is suffering from dementia, so they have to monitor him both physically and psychologically,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gigante is serving a 12-year prison sentence for racketeering and murder-conspiracy convictions.</p>
