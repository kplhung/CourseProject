        <p>The distribution of free books overseas by the grassroots Darien Book Aid Plan from the beginning had the support of Congress as well as the State Department and the U.S. Army (''Filling the Need to Read with Tons of Books,'' June 11).</p>
        <p>In the late 1940's the possibility that Congress might discontinue the Voice of America broadcasts caused much concern by those who believed the American way of life needed to be communicated to other lands.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth and Gordon Lamont of Darien suggested that book plan to then-Congressman John Davis Lodge of Westport, soon to be re-elected to a second term. He took up the idea with Senator Karl Mundt of South Dakota, and the Lamont-Lodge proposal was incorporated into the Smith-Mundt Act, also known as the U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948.</p>
        <p>Soon, with the backing of the Darien school superintendent, Boy and Girl Scouts and service clubs, United States magazines and books were collected for the first shipment to Germany.</p>
        <p>The mission quickly spread from Europe to North Africa, the Middle East and Asia -- and in 51 years to the benefit of countless readers in over 150 countries.</p>

        <p>Mr. DeLong is the author of ''John Davis Lodge: A Life in Three Acts,'' published earlier this year by Sacred Heart University Press, Fairfield.</p>
