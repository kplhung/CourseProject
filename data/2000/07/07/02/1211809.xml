        <p>FOR some New Yorkers, the summer weekend shuttle is in full throttle. Those with second homes outside the city are making that trek. They hope to relax and play host to others fleeing the concrete and pray that the two goals are not mutually exclusive.</p>
        <p>First there's the guest list. Whom to ask? Given the vagaries of compatability, not to mention partners, children, animals and sleep habits, why invite anyone?</p>
        <p>''The real thing is this 48-hour mad dash to get there, relax, and get back,'' said Lonnie Soury, the president of Soury Communications, a public relations firm in Chelsea. ''You have to be careful about who you invite to share that experience, because basically there just isn't that much time.''</p>
        <p>People play host, of course, because they like having company. Mr. Soury, who lives with his wife and two sons on the Upper West Side, has had a house on the North Fork for the last 15 years. He considers himself something of an expert on weekend guests.</p>
        <p>Besides the time constraints, the mythic country weekend often unfolds without the distractions and conveniences of New York life, Mr. Soury said. It is a situation that begs for people who can hold a conversation, not do too much damage and take care of themselves.</p>
        <p>There are two categories of people to be avoided, Mr. Soury and other dual householders said. One type, the control freaks, will try to dictate everything, from what you eat to what you do for fun.</p>
        <p>''I had a friend who went into my kitchen and started cooking bluefish,'' Mr. Soury recalled. ''I don't like bluefish. She said we had to eat bluefish.''</p>
        <p>Then there are the stressed-out city dwellers who show up, flop on the couch, and expect not to lift a finger all weekend because they have a host to nurture them.</p>
        <p>Still, even if guests do follow the basics -- taking a gift, cleaning up after themselves, giving the host space -- it's not enough if they are incompatible.</p>
        <p>So says an Upper West Side college professor. He and his wife just bought a place in upstate New York, and they are novices to the guest routine.</p>
        <p>''You can't use my name,'' he said. ''Someone's feelings might get hurt.''</p>
        <p>Their place is big and bucolic. They have a guest list, but others drop hints. It may go like this: ''Oh, we're thinking of buying out there. Can we come out?''</p>
        <p>''It can be a problem,'' the professor said. ''I can like them, but I'm not prepared to spend the whole weekend with them.</p>
        <p>''Of course, in the future, we'll have some people up who we think are great friends, and we'll hate living with them for two days.''</p>
        <p>Some weekenders dread having guests.</p>
        <p>''I'm always horrified when that call comes when people want to visit us for the weekend,'' said Maurice Berger, a critic and author, who shares a house in East Hampton with his partner, Marvin Heiferman. Mr. Berger said he considered his weekend place a retreat. He likes to work there without worrying about entertaining or privacy.</p>
        <p>''It's that feeling that my little treetop is about to be invaded,'' he said. ''Marvin doesn't have that sense of the closing off of the world. He says what's the difference between putting on 2 steaks or 10?''</p>
        <p>''Some people have good boundaries and so they make good house guests,'' Mr. Berger said. ''But many people, especially urban people, don't know those boundaries. They're in your face.''</p>
        <p>The great excuse for weekend-guest phobics is that they are already booked. Family obligations. Work.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, the guest list shapes itself, because certain places work only for certain people, as one Washington Heights writer found. She and her husband recently bought an old schoolhouse on the Delaware River. They tote their baby on weekends and renovate.</p>
        <p>''There's no beach there,'' she said. ''It cuts out those people. It's rustic. We have to pick people who like that, which cuts out some of our friends. So far, the guests have been people we've actually lived with before, so it has worked out well. We have one friend who has a rambunctious dog who is a negative for the apartment in the city. Now she can bring the dog out.''</p>
        <p>What she did not count on was that the guests would get a wide-angle view of her private life. One night, her 10-month-old son had a sore throat and they had no baby medications. Which led to the Great Tylenol Fight.</p>
        <p>''It was the middle of the night and my husband and I were screaming at each other about what to do,'' she said. ''We rarely fight. We woke up some guests, who were asking, 'What can we do?' ''</p>
        <p>In the end, they packed up the baby and drove 40 miles to a minimart that sold Tylenol.</p>
        <p>The baby is fine. The marriage is fine. The weekend guests will continue.</p>
