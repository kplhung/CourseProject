        <p>By notifying the Reform Party that he does not intend to run for president this year, Ross Perot has apparently ended an improbable political career that sparked widespread interest in third-party alternatives to Republicans and Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot's letter to the chairman of the Reform presidential nominations committee, which was delivered Friday night, suggested that even from behind the curtain, he was still  trying to exert a degree of influence over the primary process of the party he founded,  largely at the expense of its leading contender for the Reform Party's nomination, the former Republican presidential candidate and television commentator Patrick J.

        <p>By notifying the Reform Party that he does not intend to run for president this year, Ross Perot has apparently ended an improbable political career that sparked widespread interest in third-party alternatives to Republicans and Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot's letter to the chairman of the Reform presidential nominations committee, which was delivered Friday night, suggested that even from behind the curtain, he was still  trying to exert a degree of influence over the primary process of the party he founded,  largely at the expense of its leading contender for the Reform Party's nomination, the former Republican presidential candidate and television commentator Patrick J. Buchanan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot proposed that in place of having his name on the ballot, which he earned through petition signatures collected on his behalf, a line would read ''No Endorsement,'' giving primary voters the chance to express dissatisfaction with other candidates, as he said, who ''do not represent the principles of the Reform.''</p>
        <p>Michael Farris, chairman of the presidential nominations committee, said yesterday that he did not know how the three-member panel would decide the issue. The party constitution recognizes the possibility of making no endorsement but does not discuss how that decision might be derived.</p>
        <p>Still, it seemed abundantly clear to many party leaders that Mr. Perot's request was directed at Mr. Buchanan as a rebuke of his agenda as antithetical to the party platform and as a serious effort to undermine his support on the eve of primary voting.</p>
        <p>The Reform candidate is selected by mail and Internet voting, starting on Wednesday and concluding on Aug. 9. The winner will be announced at the party convention that week in Long Beach, Calif.</p>
        <p>''It's an extremely cynical approach,'' Bay Buchanan, chief campaign strategist for her brother, said of Mr. Perot's request, asserting that he and his supporters are using the request ''to protest Pat Buchanan and the appeal is the way they are going to do it.''</p>
        <p>Even so, she added, ''We will dominate the convention.''</p>
        <p>Russell Verney, a spokesman for Mr. Perot, said the request was not specifically aimed at Mr. Buchanan, but rather as a way for voters to reject anyone who would draw the party away from its traditional roots. They include silence on otherwise divisive issues like abortion rights and homosexuality, which Mr. Buchanan addresses often on the stump.</p>
        <p>''They're reading more into it than they should,'' Mr. Verney said of Buchanan supporters who feel disturbed by the request. ''This was not to support or oppose any one candidate. It was to allow members to clearly express their opinion, and a lot of them told Ross it was better to have no person as a candidate than the wrong person.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Verney conceded that he did not know if the nominating rules permit the party to accept Mr. Perot's request. But if they did not, he said Mr. Perot would not change his mind and run.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Perot's request, the Buchanan campaign has asked the nominations committee to insist that the other candidate in the race, John Hagelin, not be placed on the ballot unless he promises not to seek the nomination from another party if he fails to win the Reform endorsement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagelin, a physicist, has run for president before as the nominee of the Natural Law Party, winning less than 1 percent of the vote in 1996.</p>
        <p>''I don't consider him a major threat,'' Ms. Buchanan said. ''But our argument is that if you put him on our ballot, he gains lots of prestige and national attention. Then if he loses and goes to another party, he uses the prestige of the Reform Party against us. That's a rule or ruin approach.''</p>
        <p>In responding to the Buchanan challenge, Mr. Hagelin sidestepped the issue and charged that Mr. Buchanan was raising concerns only because he felt his lead slipping away.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot ran for president in 1992 and 1996 under the Reform Party banner which he formed out of growing disenchantment with the political mainstream and brought new focus to old issues like trade and campaign finance reform that some voters continue to find troubling.</p>
