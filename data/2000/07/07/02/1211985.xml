        <p>Raymond Lane, president and chief operating officer of the Oracle Corporation has resigned, the company said late yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane, 53, had been at Oracle, the world's second-largest software publisher, for eight years and had held the post of president since 1996. Though he was the second-ranking executive, he had always been overshadowed by Oracle's flamboyant chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane's abrupt departure came just days after the company admitted that it had orchestrated a surveillance campaign against its archrival, Microsoft, in an effort to prove that Microsoft was secretly financing groups that were lobbying in its defense in the federal antitrust lawsuit against it.</p>
        <p>In a short statement announcing Mr. Lane's departure, Oracle gave no indication why he resigned. Mr. Lane made no public statement and could not be reached last night. He will continue to serve on Oracle's board of directors, the company said.</p>
        <p>An Oracle spokeswoman declined to say why Mr. Lane was leaving.  But she said his departure was not due to the Microsoft controversy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane's departure has been rumored for months. Several people familiar with Oracle's internal strategy said last night that Mr. Lane's role had decreased in the past year.</p>
