        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article ''A Stick, a Spaldeen, and 'Boys' Are Back to a 60's Summer'' (June 11) celebrated what was stickball's place in the fabric of New York's neighborhoods, while ruefully observing that no one plays street games on Garfield Place in Brooklyn anymore.</p>
        <p>We should remind ourselves, however, that these children's games did not disappear because of lack of interest or a shift in demographics. They were forced out of existence by adult infatuation with automobile travel.</p>

        <p>Your article ''A Stick, a Spaldeen, and 'Boys' Are Back to a 60's Summer'' (June 11) celebrated what was stickball's place in the fabric of New York's neighborhoods, while ruefully observing that no one plays street games on Garfield Place in Brooklyn anymore.</p>
        <p>We should remind ourselves, however, that these children's games did not disappear because of lack of interest or a shift in demographics. They were forced out of existence by adult infatuation with automobile travel.</p>
        <p>On my block of Garfield Place, kids still enjoy playing outdoors, but for them this means confinement to a five-foot strip of sidewalk. Stickball or any other game played in the street would simply be too dangerous to contemplate.</p>
        <p>Our affection for the street life of New York's past could go beyond idle nostalgia of we take steps to de-emphasize the auto in modern urban life and reclaim the street as a vital community resource. Today's children deserve the same safe access to our streets that an earlier generation remembers so fondly.</p>
