        <p>IT is said that nothing could be more extinct than yesterday's avant-garde. Yet ''Last Year at Marienbad'' (1961), that gilt dinosaur of another era's experimentalism, not only lives but is once more on the prowl.</p>
        <p>The thought was prompted in part by a  retrospective of 17 films directed by Alain Resnais, which opened on Friday at Lincoln Center's Walter Reade Theater. When the series screens its gorgeous fresh print of ''Marienbad'' later this month, New Yorkers may once again marvel at the formal innovation and narrative freedom that once made Mr. Resnais seem the most artful and daring figure of the French New Wave. Here were all the elements you'd need for a popular movie -- a baroque palace, fancy clothes, lush music and the young Delphine Seyrig, posed like a model in the Cinema scope frame. Yet the film's story kept quadrupling back on itself, in ways that even today can leave audiences with dilated pupils and chewed tongues.</p>

        <p>IT is said that nothing could be more extinct than yesterday's avant-garde. Yet ''Last Year at Marienbad'' (1961), that gilt dinosaur of another era's experimentalism, not only lives but is once more on the prowl.</p>
        <p>The thought was prompted in part by a  retrospective of 17 films directed by Alain Resnais, which opened on Friday at Lincoln Center's Walter Reade Theater. When the series screens its gorgeous fresh print of ''Marienbad'' later this month, New Yorkers may once again marvel at the formal innovation and narrative freedom that once made Mr. Resnais seem the most artful and daring figure of the French New Wave. Here were all the elements you'd need for a popular movie -- a baroque palace, fancy clothes, lush music and the young Delphine Seyrig, posed like a model in the Cinema scope frame. Yet the film's story kept quadrupling back on itself, in ways that even today can leave audiences with dilated pupils and chewed tongues.</p>
        <p>The prospect of revisiting ''Marienbad'' made me think of its continued novelty; but so did the simultaneous triumph of a picture by another director, Raul Ruiz. In his recently released ''Time Regained,'' Mr. Ruiz has translated to film the final novel of Proust's ''Remembrance of Things Past'' -- a presumably impossible task, which he achieved by gliding the camera along palatial corridors, or dollying it up to windows that open upon unexpected times and places. Surely, in ''Time Regained,'' we're back in Mr. Resnais's ''Marienbad.'' Or are we?</p>
        <p>''Of course, of course,'' Mr. Ruiz said from Paris when I had the effrontery to phone him with the question. ''My cinematographer and I thought a lot about 'Marienbad' when we were preparing 'Time Regained.' In fact, Alain Robbe-Grillet'' -- the screenwriter of ''Marienbad'' -- ''appears as an actor in our film, playing Goncourt. I'm an enthusiastic supporter of Resnais, including the so-called not-so-good movies.''</p>
        <p>A division into good and purportedly not so good would certainly be one method of categorizing the films in Lincoln Center's series. You might also classify the movies as avant-garde and not so avant-garde. Both schemes, as it happens, fit within the stodgiest, most un-Resnaislike framework of all: chronology.</p>
        <p>Although he remains known for the formal traits he pioneered in the 60's -- notably a dazzling, disjunctive style of editing, which is today the common property of Raul Ruiz, Oliver Stone and MTV -- Mr. Resnais long ago abandoned those mannerisms and their effect of temporal dislocation. He used to make time run forward, backward and at a 30-degree angle to the horizon all at once -- but since the mid-1980's, while almost everyone else has been getting jumpier, Mr. Resnais has favored a smoother artifice.</p>
        <p>His films have become theatrical -- explicitly so in the cases of ''Melo'' (1986), his filmed re-creation of a 1929 stage play by Henry Bernstein, and of ''Smoking/No Smoking'' (1993), adapted from the eight playlets in Alan Ayckbourn's ''Intimate Exchanges.'' Whereas ''Marienbad'' mocked such dramas of marital infidelity by turning them into a plotless absurdity, ''Melo'' and ''Smoking/No Smoking'' (making its New York premiere) are gentle and even affectionate in their approach, doing no more violence to the material than is required by placing quotation marks around it. These are plot-heavy films, shot entirely on sound stages, in which the actors basically walk in and start talking.</p>
        <p>I'd also argue that Mr. Resnais's recent satire of middle-class pretense and romantic folly, the 1997 French box-office hit ''On Connait la Chanson'' (''Same Old Song''), is implicitly stagy. As in Dennis Potter's television dramas, to which Mr. Resnais here pays homage, the attitudes and feelings of career- and apartment-obsessed Parisians are revealed through pop songs, which burst from their lips as though tiny radios had been attached to the characters' uvulas and tuned to an oldies station. For the screenplay, Mr. Resnais relied on the team of Jean-Pierre Bacri and Agnes Jaoui, dealers in well-made scripts, who characteristically portray workaday people as small, mean and frustrated. Avant-garde filmmaking? This feels more like the stuff that made the young Francois Truffaut breathe fire.</p>
        <p>BUT if chronology is as undependable as Mr. Resnais once showed it to be -- and if we take seriously that ''so-called'' in Mr. Ruiz's mention of not-so-good movies -- then there might be better ways to categorize these works.</p>
        <p>Films with little animals: having proposed in ''Marienbad'' that memory is a labyrinth, Mr. Resnais has sometimes improved the metaphor by adding lab mice to the maze. He began in the mordant fantasy ''Je T'Aime, Je T'Aime'' (1967), in which a man who's an all-around failure -- botched office job, botched writing career, botched love affair, botched suicide -- consents to be the subject of a time-travel experiment. Scientists shut him in a womblike contraption that sends him into the past. It worked just fine for the mouse, they tell him. For the man, the outcome is problematic.</p>
        <p>The mice returned in ''Mon Oncle d'Amerique'' (''My American Uncle,'' 1980), Mr. Resnais's popular essay-film on the behavioral theories of Dr. Henri Laborit. Three human characters -- a politician, an actress, a factory manager -- are joined by a few white mice to show us how animals strive to dominate their environments, and how, if they fail, they either flee or attack themselves. Other films with animals are ''I Want to Go Home'' (1989), the story of a shambling American cartoonist in the hands of French intellectuals (script by Jules Feiffer), in which animated cats keep popping up to comment on the action; and ''On Connait la Chanson,'' in which the characters are ultimately revealed to be drifting jellyfish. ''Providence'' (1977, script by David Mercer) is a borderline case, depending on how you interpret the wolfman.</p>
        <p>Films with labyrinths: all the films have a labyrinth. The maze may be architectural, cognitive, political, emotional or narrative (as in ''Smoking/No Smoking,'' whose elaborately branching plot yields a two-part, four-hour film). No matter. Mr. Resnais's characters are always scurrying through something complex and traplike.</p>
        <p>Films about dead people: according to the French critic Alain Philippon, Mr. Resnais practices ''a funereal or beyond-the-grave cinema.'' This goes to show that, American prejudices notwithstanding, writers for Cahiers du Cinema are not necessarily crazy. John Gielgud, painfully brilliant as the fabulating, cancer-ridden novelist who presides over ''Providence,'' belongs to the living dead. Pierre Arditi, as the archaeologist in ''L Amour a Mort'' (''Love Unto Death'') -- a 1984 film receiving its New York premiere in the retrospective -- has literally been brought back from the dead. The setting for ''La Vie Est un Roman'' (''Life Is a Bed of Roses,'' 1983), a playful excursion into utopias past and future, is a kind of haunted house. And the title character of the great ''Muriel'' (1963) is a ghost -- about whom, more later.</p>
        <p>Political films: what isn't political? Even ''Melo'' might qualify, since its playwright, Henry Bernstein, was a favorite target of the extreme right in 1930's France. (He was attacked as the unsavory promulgator of ''Jewish theater.'') By reviving one of Bernstein's works, Mr. Resnais also revived memories of the period from which it came.</p>
        <p>But, to use the word ''political'' more directly: Mr. Resnais began as a documentary filmmaker, provocative, controversial, highly skilled. ''Les Statues Meurent Aussi'' (''Statues Also Weep,'' 1953), his protest against French colonialism in Africa as seen through its effects on art, ran up against government censorship. ''Night and Fog'' (1955), his film on the Nazi death camps, remains an unsurpassed meditation on the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Resnais rejected the project of making a documentary on the atom bomb, the refusal led to his first feature, the epoch-making ''Hiroshima, Mon Amour'' (1959). Marguerite Duras's screenplay was derided at the time, most memorably by Pauline Kael, and for my money it deserves to earn horse laughs in perpetuity. (Never mind the incantations that pass for dialogue. What about the equation of one woman's suffering with the destruction of a whole city?) But images and sounds had never before been played off of one another so boldly, with such freedom; and given the horrific content of some of those images, the beauty of others, the film still has the power to shock and astonish.</p>
        <p>The trace of politics that marked ''Hiroshima, Mon Amour'' seemed to disappear within the pure game-playing of ''Last Year at Marienbad'' -- although I suspect something's being commented upon when characters who always wear evening clothes get stuck in an elaborate old house. (''Marienbad'' is a bit like Luis Bunuel's contemporaneous ''The Exterminating Angel,'' realized with a glamour that's either exquisite or flat-out excessive.) But with his next two films, ''Muriel'' and ''La Guerre Est Finie'' (''The War Is Over,'' 1966), and later with his comeback film ''Stavisky . . .'' (1974), politics returned in full force, as Mr. Resnais rooted his virtuosity deep within the concerns of the Western European left.</p>
        <p>Visually lush -- no, wholly outrageous -- ''Stavisky . . .'' reimagines the downfall of a real-life con artist whose undoing shook the French government in 1934. Starring Jean-Paul Belmondo at the height of his animal charm and Charles Boyer at his most noble, the film was the second that Mr. Resnais made from a script by the novelist Jorge Semprun. The first was ''La Guerre Est Finie,'' starring Yves Montand as an identity-shifting, border-crossing Communist agitator against Franco's regime. Shot with the brusqueness of a thriller, and with an eye for picturesquely unlovely urban locales, ''La Guerre Est Finie'' is, among other things, a time capsule of political (and sexual-political) attitudes in mid-60's France, bringing the Old Left into confrontation with its exhaustion on the one side and with the New Left on the other.</p>
        <p>FINALLY, there's ''Muriel.'' Here, too, we find a conflict of generations, set within a political context. A middle-aged widow in a provincial city receives a visit from her long-lost lover, who had disappeared at the start of World War II. While she's busy reliving the Occupation (and wondering what brought this man to town), her stepson, recently returned from military service in Algeria, is dealing with a crisis of his own: his anguish at having helped torture to death a young Arab woman.</p>
        <p>Although it's emphatically a film of its own time, ''Muriel'' is also so dense with life, so deeply thought through, so inventively constructed and movingly performed, that it feels as fresh and urgent as ever. How to categorize this movie? Try ''Political films, avant-garde, starring Delphine Seyrig, script by Jean Cayrol.'' Cross-index: ''Apartment obsession, shifting identities, horses and goats (but no small animals), fake documentary within a fiction film, ghosts.'' Master file (always current): ''Directed by Alain Resnais.''</p>
