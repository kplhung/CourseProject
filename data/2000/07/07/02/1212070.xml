        <p>THE CIRCUS FIRE</p>
        <p>A True Story.</p>
        <p>By Stewart O'Nan.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 370 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Doubleday. $24.95.</p>
        <p>The circus balls up the world's flamboyance and presents it for our entertainment -- provoking apprehension, belly laughter, exotic poignance, sheer amazement and even, perhaps, an abbreviated affection for a particular stranger's brave grace. Then, tantalizingly, the show travels on. It's never ours for long.</p>
        <p>Mostly, we go with our children because the marvels of the circus appeal to their innocence, playing on it as if in a rehearsal for life. The clowns' pratfalls created a theater of the absurd way before Ionesco, and they resonate with real-world insecurities. Here is a sweet-sour buffoonery whose stunts may mirror our own puzzling dilemmas. The circus ''is the only ageless delight that you can buy for money,'' Ernest Hemingway once wrote. Its very rings are a part of the spell, their seamless roundness suggesting what we might wish to substitute for our own jagged lives.</p>
        <p>There are a number of estimable circus books by authors like John Culhane, Bill Ballantine and John and Alice Durant, but none until now have been devoted to the biggest of American big-show disasters. (And calamity is what circuses do seem to flirt with.) The Hartford blaze that consumed Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey's big top during the July 6, 1944, matinee cost 167 spectators their lives and was the worst public catastrophe in Connecticut's history. Just a hundred of these people were over the age of 15, and only 10 of them were men -- because it was a Thursday, a workday. Four hundred eighty-seven people were listed as injured.</p>
        <p>In the foreword to ''Circus Fire,'' Stewart O'Nan, who has published several highly praised novels, tells us he was interested in the disaster even before he moved to Hartford, and eventually he turned his research into this conscientious, quite exhaustive reconstruction -- rousting out survivors, searching for family stories and medical reports, and digging a lot in newspaper morgues. After more than half a century, he still manages a graphic chronicle of burns that peeled off the victims' skin like ripped sleeves or turned their flesh to peanut butter, of intense heat that shrank their biceps in ''pugilistic'' postures and fused trampled piles of human remains into something resembling blackened lava.</p>
        <p>It was a hot day, and on the sidewall behind the southwest bleachers a small flame sprang up. In an instant, it was, as O'Nan puts it, ''eating the roof, finding fuel.'' At first, the performance continued; some members of the audience even thought the flames were part of the show. Quickly, though, the crowd's mood shifted, and the panic became as ugly as the fire would be horrific. People tried to run from the tent by the same routes they'd entered, even though these were now blocked by crowd-control barriers or cage chutes for the lion and leopard acts. Meanwhile, the waterproofing on the canvas overhead -- a mortal mix of paraffin and gasoline -- dripped down like napalm. The poles that held the tent upright finally fell over.</p>
        <p>O'Nan is obsessively best when it comes to describing the gruesome wounds, the corpses, the action that can resemble that of a battlefield. This unsettling gift worked better in novels like ''The Names of the Dead'' and ''A Prayer for the Dying'' because we knew the characters better. Although his circus lingo is accurate and his empathy and fair-mindedness toward the multitude of players is evident throughout, ''The Circus Fire'' is an eerily narrow-gauge book, with a thicket of victims' names, telescoped paragraphs and summary jottings, often staccato in tone, like combat reporting.</p>
        <p>This wasn't a greedy era. The circus paid only about $4 million in damages, and the city of Hartford, though perhaps nearly as liable (there were no fire engines stationed anywhere close to the lot), paid nothing. Short jail sentences were meted out to five showmen, and Ringling Brothers soon got back on the road. It didn't cease performing under canvas until July 1956, when television and other alterations in the public's taste put it out of business as a big-top spectacle. The fire had little to do with the circus's change of venue.</p>
        <p>I worked for Ringling Brothers myself less than a decade after the disaster, in 1951 and 1952. (Among his illustrations, O'Nan includes two photographs of my boss, Blackie Barlow, and mentions by name two of the animals I cared for.) The circus view of the tragedy, though seldom put into words, was more complex than O'Nan communicates. It must be remembered that about 8,000 people walked away from the fire unscathed. And the fact that the others had trampled one another in pitiful pileups (instead of simply lifting the canvas sidewall and stepping outside) may suggest herd habits that allow people to be entertained en masse in the first place. Risk, resourcefulness, transience and a chameleon irony are the givens of life among those who work for the circus. The context of its world is larger than this writer seems to know.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, O'Nan does justice to the handful of people whose heroism stood out. A man in the audience, Bill Curlee, saved numerous children by hoisting them over the barrier of the lions' chute -- until one of his legs slipped through the bars and the mob mauled him, crushed him and left him to burn. May Kovar, the leopard trainer, also rushed to help. And the incomparable bandmaster, Merle Evans, remained at his post near the back exit playing ''The Stars and Stripes Forever'' -- a circus disaster signal, but a means of directing the stampeding crowd -- on his silver cornet in a snowfall of scorching canvas till the last survivable moment, when a quarterpole fell where he'd been. Then he and some of his men continued to blow outdoors.</p>
        <p>O'Nan lapses into garrulity once the fire and its immediate aftermath are past. But for me his lavish documentation (which so often reads as if he were a newspaperman on the scene, phoning in as many facts and impressions as possible) suggests a larger theme. Perhaps the circumscribed horror of a circus fire -- of fun gone wrong -- will typify not the old century but the new one, in which we may suffer a pox of isolated catastrophes rather than a few gigantic worldwide conflagrations. In capturing them, a writer of manifold talents like Stewart O'Nan ought to prosper.</p>
