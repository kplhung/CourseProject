        <p>MOST of this year's presidential campaign has dealt with the candidates' positions on campaign financing, Social Security and helping the uninsured.

        <p>MOST of this year's presidential campaign has dealt with the candidates' positions on campaign financing, Social Security and helping the uninsured. Now, it's time to deal with what really matters -- whose wife bakes the best cookies. You know, family values. And the 2000 presidential cookie contest pits chocolate chips, pecans and coconut against ginger and molasses. The odds favor the ones with the chocolate chips.</p>
        <p>For decades, presidential campaigns have been forced to offer family recipes. Postcards from the past, when wives stayed home and cooked, they're served up as a window on the family life of the candidates -- if somewhat artificially flavored. When Walter Mondale ran, his campaign provided an entire cookbook of family recipes.</p>
        <p>But contests pitting the baking ability of potential first ladies against each other are relatively new. They began in 1992 when Hillary Rodham Clinton got everyone shaking and baking with her infamous cookie comment, discussing working as a lawyer while her husband was governor of Arkansas.</p>
        <p>''I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas,'' she said. ''But what I decided to do was pursue my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life.''</p>
        <p>She may have been trying to say that in 1992, women had other options. Instead, her remark created a reactionary cookie contest, the brainchild of Family Circle magazine, which published her chocolate chip recipe and one from Barbara Bush. Readers were asked to vote; the results proved to be a forecast of what would happen in November.</p>
        <p>Four years later, Elizabeth Dole's pecan roll sugar cookies didn't stand a chance against a reprise of Mrs. Clinton's chocolate chip recipe. And this electoral season, Tipper Gore's Ginger Snaps, plain-Jane ginger and molasses cookies, probably won't hold up against Laura Bush's flashy Texas Governor's Mansion Cowboy Cookies. The Bush cookies are expected to win because they contain that magic ingredient -- chocolate.</p>
        <p>The surprise is how such rich cookies can be so boring. The sweetness of the Bush cookies overwhelms any other flavor except an occasional bite of chocolate. Mrs. Gore's ginger snap cookies look boring, but they are marginally better. They need more ginger, though.</p>
        <p>Bland cookies seem appropriate for the current presidential campaign. And it seems fitting, too, that the magazine's recipe for the Bush cookies turns out tough cookies. The recipe Mrs. Bush's office submitted suggested that her cookies be baked for 10 to 12 minutes. Family Circle changed it to 17 to 20. A friend who baked the cookies following the magazine's directions turned out unattractive jawbreakers; the cookies should have soft centers. At 17 minutes in my oven the cowboy cookies were also overdone.</p>
        <p>Even worse, anyone who followed the Bush recipe as it first appeared on the magazine's Web site may have found their cookies turn to ashes, possibly a small fire. The site's suggested baking time of 17 to 29 minutes has since been corrected.</p>
        <p>An expert in the tastes of Middle America, Peggy Katalinich, the Family Circle food director, says, ''If you have chocolate chips in your cookies, you're ahead of the game.'' Who wins the cookie contest, she says, ''depends on whether you vote your politics or your taste buds.''</p>
        <p>But if recipe contests are important in telling voters something to help them decide which candidate to choose, isn't it time for a cook-off between the vice president and the governor? Tennessee barbecue versus Texas barbecue. And that's something you can really sink your teeth into.</p>
        <p>TIPPER GORE'S GINGER SNAPS</p>
        <p>3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</p>
        <p>2 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</p>
        <p>3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter, at room temperature</p>
        <p>2 cups sugar</p>
        <p>2 eggs</p>
        <p>1/2 cup molasses</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons white distilled vinegar.</p>
        <p>1. Heat oven to 325 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. Mix flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon and cloves in large bowl.</p>
        <p>3. In large bowl, beat butter with electric mixer at medium speed until smooth and creamy, 1 minute. Gradually beat in sugar. Beat at medium speed until combined, 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>4. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each. Beat in molasses and vinegar until combined, 1 minute.</p>
        <p>5. On low speed, beat in flour mixture.</p>
        <p>6. For each cookie, roll 1 rounded tablespoon dough into ball. Place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheet. With fork, flatten each, and make cross-hatch pattern.</p>
        <p>7. Bake in oven 15 to 16 minutes, until slightly browned around edges. Remove cookies to rack to cool.</p>
        <p>Yield: about 4 dozen cookies.</p>

        <p>1. Heat oven to 350 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in bowl.</p>
        <p>3. In a very large bowl, beat butter with an electric mixer at medium speed until smooth and creamy. Gradually beat in sugars, and combine thoroughly.</p>
        <p>4. Add eggs one at a time, beating after each. Beat in vanilla.</p>
        <p>5. Stir in flour mixture until just combined. Stir in chocolate chips, oats, coconut and pecans.</p>
        <p>6. For each cookie, drop  1/4 cup dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing 3 inches apart.</p>
        <p>7. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, until edges are lightly browned; rotate sheets halfway through. Remove cookies from rack to cool.</p>
        <p>Yield: 3 to 3 1/2 dozen cookies.</p>
