        <p>IT was not too long ago that Fiorello LaGuardia refused to get off an airplane here because his ticket showed New York as the destination -- an early example of the effectiveness of the publicity stunt. Lost in Mayor LaGuardia's geographic elitism was the fact that Newark International was the region's first major airport when it opened in 1928 -- and for a while the country's busiest.</p>
        <p>Today, the three major airports in the New York City area move 89 million people a year, a transportation network second only to London's Heathrow and Gatwick. Kennedy International Airport links New York with the rest of the world. LaGuardia, with a large domestic operation, was the result of a sustained campaign by the colorful mayor.</p>
        <p>As the two newer airports competed for its passengers, Newark fell on hard times. In the 1950's the airport's restaurants drew more customers than its airlines. But in the aftermath of airline deregulation -- when People Express, the no-frills carrier, chose an abandoned terminal at Newark as its base in 1981 -- the airport was reborn.</p>
        <p>These days, Newark International is the 10th-busiest airport in the nation, surpassing even Kennedy in annual passenger volume. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, operator of all three airports, says Newark contributes $11.3 billion annually to the region's economy.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the airport is so busy that its ability to provide necessary services is strained. Just getting to the airport on time is an exercise in frustration, parking is insufficient and the monorail system connecting the three terminals -- envisioned as a link from the airport with New Jersey Transit and Amtrak -- has itself become a problem.</p>
        <p>Though the monorail, which began operating in 1996, has already cost more than $300 million, its performance has been inconsistent; and bringing the service up to expectations will cost tens of millions more. Worse, the monorail will be closed for months beginning this summer to work out the bugs.</p>
        <p>The Port Authority has nearly a dozen construction projects under way to deal with crowding, including two parking garages -- one scheduled to open in 2001 and the other with no completion date set -- with a total of 6,600 spaces to augment the existing 17,000. Air traffic control, which handles 1,200 to 1,400 flights a day, is getting a new tower that will be completed by the end of 2002. And the offices of the Port Authority itself are moving from the airfield area to make more room for servicing airplanes.</p>
        <p>The hall that houses United States Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization service processes 4 million passengers a year, and at peak times the lines resemble those at Disney World during summer vacation.</p>
        <p>Customs officials said they are hopeful the situation will improve when Continental Airlines opens its own international area in Terminal C. The expansion includes 12 new gates for wide-bodied jetliners -- a mixed blessing that will insure the arrival of thousands of additional passengers.</p>
        <p>''We want to add more capacity overall,'' explained Susan Baer, the Port Authority's general manager for New Jersey airports. That is no mean trick considering that there is little room for expansion on the 2,000-acre property. Kennedy, in contrast, has more than twice as much land.</p>
        <p>Joel Jacoby, Ms. Baer's deputy, says keeping up with the success of the airport presents a huge challenge. ''We're constrained in the amount of land,'' Mr. Jacoby said. ''All developable property is developed. We redesign facilities with the same footprint.''</p>
        <p>In an airport that is constantly growing and never sleeps, keeping up is -- as one Port Authority official put it -- like doing ''surgery on a patient who refuses to lie down.''</p>
        <p>Although the air passenger traffic winds down around midnight, the runways are kept busy and the south side of the airport throbs with the Federal Express operation. Fifty-four cargo flights, requiring about 1,500 employees, make the overnight shift the company's busiest time of day.</p>
        <p>Newark airport is, in essence, a virtual city. It has a transitory population of 90,000, and its 24,000 permanent residents, the employees, are the heart of the operation.</p>
        <p>''I'm the mayor,'' Ms. Baer said. ''To manage facilities you must manage people.''</p>
        <p>FUELING THE JETS  Robert Dickerson  Keeps Them Flying</p>
        <p>Robert Dickerson does not need any motivational speeches as he begins his day refueling jets at 5 a.m.</p>
        <p>''Airplanes can go without people,'' Mr. Dickerson said. ''They can go without bags. They can go without food, and many times they do. But they can't leave without fuel.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dickerson, 42, of Hazlet, works for Ogden Aviation, which contracts with the Port Authority to receive, store, test and dispense up to 2 1/2 million gallons of Jet A aviation fuel every day. For eight hours, Mr. Dickerson, like his 128 co-workers, works alone as he pumps fuel from underground hydrants into the wings of seven or eight aircraft.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dickerson likes to work the airlines that require him to deliver the completed fueling paperwork to the pilots in the cockpit, since he has not outgrown his childhood fascination with flying.</p>
        <p>''That's a nice part of working here,'' he says. ''To go into the cockpit and look around. Passengers never get to see a cockpit.''</p>
        <p>Every fueling operation begins with an order from the airline for enough fuel to get the plane to its destination and to an alternate airport, with a small percentage extra for unexpected delays. Pulling a stepladder from his truck, Mr. Dickerson walks beneath the enormous wings, climbs the ladder and opens a panel on the underside of the wing to check how much fuel is on the aircraft. Sometimes, there is already enough.</p>
        <p>''In the beginning I was worried about the math,'' he confesses. ''You think the math is going to be harder then it is.'' Pulling his security from his shirt pocket, he says, ''They give us free calculators.''</p>
        <p>The actual refueling takes 25 to 30 minutes. Only the beginning and end are difficult. ''The hoses are heavy and awkward, but you got to get used to them,'' he says. ''You work hard for a couple of minutes then stand around.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dickerson knows many of the ramp workers, and when there's time, there is socializing -- or commiserating if the weather is bad.</p>
        <p>''Rain, heat, snow, I don't mind the cold, but I don't like the rain,'' he says. ''A bad day is a rainy day and all the planes coming in need fuel.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, the inclement bad weather that paralyzes the airlines and strands passengers is a welcome relief for Mr. Dickerson. ''It's a good day when all your planes cancel,'' he said.</p>
        <p>JUGGLING THE OPERATION  Jeff Krisiak, Point Man  For Continental</p>
        <p>Mr. Dickerson's dream day is Jeff Krisiak's worst nightmare. Mr. Krisiak, the operations manager for Continental Airlines, remembers with a wince the unexpected snowstorm in April that stranded airplanes on the runway.</p>
        <p>''We didn't know how bad the storm would be,' he says. ''The planes left the gate and stayed out on the runway. We brought catering trucks and re-catered them. We took the trash and emptied the lavs. There were planes out there five or six hours.''</p>
        <p>When another snowstorm was forecast in May, Continental was more prepared. It arranged to transport its East Coast passengers to their destinations on Amtrak.</p>
        <p>''We sent people by train to Portland, Providence, Hartford, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Virginia Beach, Albany, Buffalo,'' Mr. Krisiak recalled. ''Our long-term goal will be to code share with Amtrak. We took care of about 600 people that day.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Krisiak, who joined Continental in 1983, says he has had to make plenty of tough decisions -- some right, some wrong.</p>
        <p>''If you do a good job, everybody takes the credit,'' he said. ''If you make the hard decision to downgrade from a DC-10 to a 757 and lose 100 seats, the bosses come back and say, 'Jeff, why, why, why?' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Krisiak works in the airline's large operations center, illuminated for the most part by a wall of windows. After driving to work from his home in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, he enters the office through an unmarked door in an area of the Continental terminal not yet open. The tranquility of the large tropical fish tank by the entrance belies the intensity of the activity. Two dozen people are responsible for monitoring every facet of Continental's operations here. They communicate with the ground workers and the crews aboard the aircraft. They watch each plane on the ground from video cameras mounted at the gates.</p>
        <p>''We have 524 operations per day,'' Mr. Krisiak said, ''262 arrivals, 262 departures. We have incoming information on all of the flights.'' With this information, the center's staff can dispatch such equipment as a replacement part or a wheel chair for a passenger before a plane arrives at the gate.</p>
        <p>''A captain can call and have an issue,'' he said, motioning to three aircraft mechanics seated at computers. ''We can go into the computer right here and tell him his plane's maintenance history.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Krisiak went on: ''There's been a change in mindset. People were reacting. Now we're getting people to understand the time-saving benefit of pre-planning.''</p>
        <p>DELIVERING BAD NEWS  Robert Baldwin Serves  By Smiling (and Singing)</p>
        <p>''In the morning I put my oatmeal on the table and mix it with humor,'' said Robert Baldwin, a customer service representative for the Port Authority. He wears the standard-issue grey trousers and red blazer to indicate he is one of 160 people hired by the airport to help confused travelers.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Baldwin is one of a kind.</p>
        <p>From the bright glass-walled monorail station in Terminal C, he sings: ''Hello my friends. Welcome to Terminal C. Only the best to you,'' projecting his voice over the noise of departing trains. He is not happy when he has to tell travelers news they might find distressing.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I may have to talk about delays on the monorail and this is bad news, so I blend it with as much positive as I can,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Women in saris, men in suits and ties, teenage girls, people pushing strollers, wheel chairs and luggage carts, ramp workers and flight attendants -- none of them escape his attention. He is a man entirely comfortable with amiability. ''I give a million-dollar greeting to everyone,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A young pilot emerges from the monorail and casts a quick and curious glance at Mr. Baldwin, who is singing again. The pilot, clearly uncomfortable, is not the only one who seems to want to avoid the jovial interaction. Mr. Baldwin doesn't notice.</p>
        <p>''People almost always look and give him a smile,'' said Michael Bekiarian of Gateway Security, the Port Authority contractor that provides the airport with customer service representatives. ''That's what the Red Coat program is all about, changing perceptions. Does he go over the top? Yes. But I see people change from their experience of him.''</p>
        <p>Two middle-aged Japanese women laugh and clap as a companion videotapes Mr. Baldwin crooning: ''Train to terminals B, A and rental cars on the left. Step lively, now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baldwin of Belleville, who for years worked for years as a hotel bellman at the Marriott in Hanover, was hired by Gateway a year ago. In a typical eight-hour shift he can answer close to 500 questions. They can be posed politely, as in ''Where are the restaurants?'' or be no more than a simple ''B?'' barked rudely. His answers never reflect anything less than sheer delight at the chance to help.</p>
        <p>EXAMINING THE BAGS  Tony Maresca,  Always Suspicious</p>
        <p>If there is one time of day when international passengers should not arrive at the customs and immigration hall, it is from noon to 6 p.m., when most international flights land here.</p>
        <p>''We can have six planes arrive all around the same time, each with 200 people or more,'' said Tony Maresca, an assistant chief inspector, ''so that's 1,200 people in the prime arrival time. They go through Immigration and then they come here to wait for their bags.''</p>
        <p>When a flight gets a serious examination from the officers supervised by Mr. Maresca, the passengers have to wait a little longer for their baggage. ''Every day we target a flight and give it a good inspection,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On this day, it was Continental Airlines Flight 1866 from Bogota. The passengers deplaned and 10 Customs officers and a drug-sniffing dog got on. A portable X-ray machine was set up at the end of the belt loader, which held boxed cargo. Mr. Maresca looked on, sober in his dark uniform.</p>
        <p>The luggage had been taken inside, where it was also on a conveyor belt, ascending to the baggage carousels in the room above. Two dogs were running the treadmill along with the suitcases, sniffing each approaching bag.</p>
        <p>''You have to balance this activity because a lot of these passengers have connecting flights,'' said Marco Galiano, supervisor of the K-9 enforcement unit, who joined Mr. Maresca. ''We don't want them to miss their flights, but we've got to get dope off the street.''</p>
        <p>As he talks, a suitcase gets one of the dogs scratching excitedly. A description of the bag is called up to a Customs inspector before it is sent into the baggage claim area with the others. A woman traveling with two young children retrieves the bag and a moment later she is standing at a metal table, the bag opened before a young agent.</p>
        <p>''People hide drugs on kids,'' Mr. Maresca said, explaining how difficult it is to define usual suspects.</p>
        <p>Then again, there are some dead giveaways. ''Here's a classic,'' he said. ''It's July and someone is wearing a coat. They won't take it off.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Maresca and Mr. Galiano talk, they glance at the young mother. Three uniformed agents are standing much closer to her, doing a poor job of trying to look nonchalant. Small boxes of coffee are removed, examined and repacked.</p>
        <p>A sigh of understanding emerges from Mr. Galiano. ''Sometimes we train the dogs with coffee,'' he said. ''She's got a lot of coffee there.'' Interest in her suitcase is waning, and five minutes later she and her children are on their way.</p>
        <p>''Usually, we tell the passenger why their bag was selected for inspection,'' Mr. Maresca said. ''We tell them it was the dog. If we're going to hold them up, at least we should tell them why.''</p>
        <p>CLEANING THE BATHROOMS  Elina Mendoza  Keeps Things Tidy</p>
        <p>During the course of her shift, from 1 to 9 p.m., hundreds of women will encounter Elina Mendoza cleaning the bathroom by gates 60 to 68 in Terminal B. She is there to make sure the bathroom is tidy, but beyond that her presence creates an expectation.</p>
        <p>''When there is not someone there, people won't clean up after themselves,'' Ms. Mendoza, from Elizabeth, explained in Spanish.</p>
        <p>Susan Baer, the airport manager, agreed. ''It's all psychology,'' she said. ''In the bathrooms, seeing a person cleaning up assures you the bathroom is clean. It tells you 'this is a priority.' ''</p>
        <p>Sheets of mirror and brushed steel partitions around the toilets beg for polishing. Countertops need mopping up. Going about these tasks, Ms. Mendoza wears a uniform of black pants, white blouse and floppy bow tie. On her hands are disposable surgical gloves and she's ready with a rag and squirt bottle of cleaner. She also makes sure there is paper in the stalls and at the sinks and not on the floor. ''My days are busy, very full,'' she said. ''I'm constantly in motion.''</p>
        <p>Using the interview as an opportunity to sit down for a few minutes in the darkened supply area adjoining the bathroom, she went on, ''Some people tell me this is not the best job, but when people ask me if I like my job I say, 'yes.' ''</p>
        <p>And there are always questions, some more peculiar than others.</p>
        <p>One woman sticks in her memory. ''She asked me where were the public showers,'' she said. ''I told her there are no public showers here. Two days later I saw her again. She had been stuck in the airport for two days.'' She said, 'Please, please. Where can I clean up? I'm desperate.' Finally I let her use the big utility sink in the supply room.''</p>
        <p>LOADING AND UNLOADING  Ron Fizer,  Man in a Hurry</p>
        <p>There is a determination to Ron Fizer's stride as he crosses the 200 yards of airway between the Continental ramp crew office to the Terminal C gate, where he will spend the next eight hours. Mr. Fizer -- who is responsible for everything that goes on or comes off an airplane while at the gate except fuel and food -- is dressed in blue pants, a work shirt and a high-visibility orange net vest. He swings a tool box in his right hand. On his left arm he wears a watch. He will refer to it often.</p>
        <p>''The first thing I do is get information about my flights,'' explains Mr. Fizer, who has driven in from his home in Lakewood. For that he heads for a door a level below the jetway.</p>
        <p>Just inside the doorway the hall is lined with pilots' black flight cases, stacked like bricks one atop the other. The 48-year-old Mr. Fizer moves quickly, passing first through the pilots' lounge, then a second room, this one dim and occupied by a dozen pilots dozing on recliners. In the room beyond, ramp workers sit at tables eating lunch.</p>
        <p>''I need the upload for flight 319,'' he says to a man at a desk at the end of the lunchroom. Receiving a white printout, he returns outside to the MD-80 at gate 109, which is headed to Washington.</p>
        <p>''Usually these planes are packed,'' he said, showing off the deep storage space of the plane's three open belly compartments, which are empty. ''We can load 11,000 to 15,000 pounds in four minutes. Four guys can download 25,000 pounds.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fizer checks the water supply on board from a panel on the front of the plane's wing. Then he moves on to the nose wheel. Taking a pin from his tool box he slips it into a joint on the gear, enabling the wheel to pivot freely. Now a tow bar and tug can be used to push the plane from the gate at departure. It takes two men to attach the tow bar, and the entire operation is complete is 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fizer checks his watch. It's 3:11, and the first of the luggage for flight 319 arrives. He reaches into the curtained container and begins tossing bags onto the conveyor belt receding into the cargo compartment. He checks the tag on every third or fourth suitcase saying: ''I don't want a Detroit bag on this flight. I don't want a Fort Lauderdale bag on this flight. I don't want a Paris bag on this flight. We're not going to Paris.''</p>
        <p>At 3:25 the cargo doors are locked. Mr. Fizer checks his watch. ''Minutes are precious,'' he says. ''They can make or break a flight.'' At 3:31 a small suitcase is delivered to Mr. Fizer by a uniformed pilot. A minute later a stroller is sent down a circular metal chute and the cargo door is opened once again.</p>
        <p>The last-minute stowing of baggage is a regular occurrence these days as passengers strain the limits of the overhead storage bins.</p>
        <p>''One hundred and fifty passengers all want to keep their luggage with them,'' Mr. Fizer said, shaking his head. ''Somebody's got to cough up a bag.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Fizer looks on, Flight 319 is pushed out to a position on the field where it will begin to move under its own power. But before the tug driver disconnects the bar from the nose gear, he takes one last, late-arriving suitcase and stashes it in the cargo area. One passenger complaint averted. Flight 319 is four minutes late out of Newark.</p>
        <p>POLICING THE AREA  John Collis  Patrols on Bike</p>
        <p>Pedaling his bicycle through the crowded international arrivals hall, Officer John Collis, 38, is blazing a trail. He wears a regulation blue jump suit and a saucy silver bike helmet as he patrols the terminals and parking lots.</p>
        <p>The bike also allows Mr. Collins to ride a fine line between the image of the traditional police officer and that of a somewhat friendlier helper that the Port Authority wants to convey. He is one of five officers here who have received bike patrol training from the New York Police Department.</p>
        <p>''You learn how to get on and off the bike and how to use the bike as a defensive weapon,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On a typical day, Officer Collis, who lives in Verona, says he will ride 20 miles or more. ''I cover a lot more ground with the bike,'' he said. 'It's an excellent tool.''</p>
        <p>Not long after his shift began one evening, he was summoned to the immigration hall at the end of a long concourse at Terminal B. A check of passports touched off a report that there was an outstanding arrest warrant for one passenger's.</p>
        <p>''Police matters can get complicated here,' he said, ticking off the list of agencies and jurisdictions involved. ''There are the federal authorities, the state police, the New York police, Newark police, postal inspectors and the Secret Service.''</p>
        <p>But days of routine patrolling outnumber those of excitement. The passenger in immigration was handed over to two officers and Officer Collis pedaled back to the terminal. An hour later he is explaining airport policy to an elderly diabetic in need of insulin who is out of syringes. Medics can be called, Officer Collis explains, though she will have to pay handsomely. The woman decides to take a cab to a nearby drugstore, and Officer Collis is off once again.</p>
        <p>DELIVERING THE MAIL  Federal Express Works While Everyone Sleeps</p>
        <p>While most people who work at Newark International spend the night sleepily oblivious to the passing of time, the Federal Express crew can document how every minute of the overnight shift is spent. In four hours they will take correspondence and cargo from 27 planes and 340 trucks, shuffle it, redistribute it and send it back out before daybreak.</p>
        <p>This operation involves 1,500 people and millions of dollars in equipment in addition to a fleet of wide bodies, jetliners and feeder aircraft that take over the airfield each night. One delay or one dropped ball can create a frenzy.</p>
        <p>''No matter what part you work, every person has an effect on the next person,'' says Joyce Kiesewetter of Woodbridge Township, an operations administrator. She is joined in the sentiment by Paula Krysa, a senior manager from Pine Branch, who adds, ''Every little piece of the puzzle makes a difference.''</p>
        <p>Ed Patterson, a control manager from Queens, N.Y., says: ''We've had nights when an aircraft down loads at 1:42. They should have been done by 1:15. Then we have to find a way to make up the time elsewhere.''</p>
        <p>Much rides on Newark, the company's biggest generator of freight, moving 385,000 pieces each night. Yet like soldiers exchanging battle stories, members of the overnight crew thrill at the obstacles they have overcome, the odds they have beaten while the rest of the airport is sleeping</p>
        <p>''There's closure when the plane is buttoned up and takes off,'' Mr. Patterson explains. ''For that day you're a winner.''</p>
