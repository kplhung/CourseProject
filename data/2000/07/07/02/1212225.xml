        <p>PREGUNTE por los especiales,'' says the menu at Charrito's: Ask for the specials. It's good advice, but you may need to do more than ask.</p>
        <p>One recent Thursday evening, the waiter -- a tall, polite young man of seemingly infinite patience -- assured me that there were no specials that night. I persisted. He shook his head. My voice rose. Finally, perhaps suspecting that I might be dangerous, he humored me by bringing a plate of enchiladas in mole sauce, a specialty of the southwestern Mexican state of Oaxaca.</p>
        <p>They were wonderful -- three corn tortillas filled with shredded chicken, afloat in a dense, bittersweet sauce the color of polished mahogany. The sauce's flavors were complex and elusive, and I learned later on that they came from a bizarre-sounding amalgam of ingredients: tomatoes, chocolate, apples, garlic, sesame seeds and four kinds of Mexican chilies. In the Oaxacan kitchen, apparently, nothing is off limits; in her book ''Seasons of My Heart: A Culinary Journey Through Oaxaca, Mexico'' (Ballantine Books, 1999), Susana Trilling says some cooks think nothing of flavoring their moles with orange soda and thickening them with ketchup and animal crackers.</p>
        <p>The waiter followed that plate-clearing triumph with another item nowhere on Charrito's standard-issue Tex-Mex menu: sopa de mariscos, or seafood soup. At $10.95, it was as expensive as anything on the menu, but it could have fed a family of four: it reminded me of prom night at the aquarium, with mussels, clams, red snapper and two monster chunks of crab jostling for space in a great crockery bowl.</p>
        <p>They swam in a reddish broth redolent of fish, tomato, chilies and herbs that could be eaten with a soup spoon or soaked up with more tortillas. A squeeze of lime and a pinch of salt added a whole new dimension, as if it were a seafood margarita.</p>
        <p>A meal at Charrito's is like that. The place is filled with powerful aromas, deep flavors, intense colors, intrigue and surprise. You could easily walk right by it on Bergenline Avenue, that pulsating pan-Latin bazaar of restaurants and variety stores, nail salons and law offices, clinics and doughnut shops that never seems to sleep. The view from the street is of a darkened storefront divided in two by a Mayan pyramid. To the left of the pyramid, people are dining; to the right, cooks bend over flaming grills, making liberal use of onions, peppers and lard.</p>
        <p>The dining room, a long and narrow trolleylike space with seats for just 46 diners, is dark and almost gloomy, until you get a load of the mural that adorns the divider between dining room and kitchen. It's alive with the saturated colors and haunting figures of Mexican magical realism -- a gaucho with a guitar and a huge-eyed woman who's a dead ringer for the painter Frida Kahlo, staring morosely out of windows separated by an ancient box camera. The mural, like the pyramid, is the work of Alexander Solodukho, a Russian-born set designer who lives in Cliffside Park and is a friend of the manager, Uzziel Arias.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arias, just 23, seems to be Charrito's ambassador to the English-speaking world; the chef and owner is his father, Filiberto, 45, who came here about 20 years ago from the town of Putla, Oaxaca. While I wish he offered more specialties of his region, the older Mr. Arias is a talented and professional cook. Few dishes on his regular menu will strike anyone as inventive or unusual, but everything is generous and filling, solid and satisfying.</p>
        <p>The tomato salsa set out with the starter tortilla chips is a great omen for the rest of the meal, fresh and homemade, electric with the contrasting flavors of hot chilies and cool coriander. Camarones al ajillo, 10 large shrimp reddened by their chili-garlic marinade, are not fiery but subtly spicy; like every other main dish, they come with piles of rice and refried beans. Another huge seafood plate incorporates four small grilled lobster tails, rice, pineapple rings and wedges of avocado.</p>
        <p>The fajitas Charrito's, another unfinishably vast plate of food, are of steak or chicken and shrimp, with onions and peppers, tortillas and beans and rice, and a scoop of homemade guacamole. The chicken in these fajitas, as well as in the chicken tacos elsewhere on the menu, is marinated and grilled for a deeper, smokier flavor than you might expect on a Tex-Mex menu.</p>
        <p>Combination platters, all $8.95, might include a slightly greasy but dense and tasty chile relleno; one of those chicken enchiladas with mole sauce; and a ''mini'' chimichanga about the size of your forearm.  Somewhere on one of these platters -- I lost track of exactly where -- is an assertive little dish of homemade green-tomatillo salsa.</p>
        <p>I asked about dessert and was offered flan. (Again, it is not on the menu.) Instead of the thin, insipid custard that turns up in mediocre Hispanic restaurants, this one had the body and caramelized depth of a good creme brulee. I ate every bite.</p>
        <p>Uzziel Arias is just back from Mexico with plans to expand Charrito's to a second floor, nearly tripling the number of seats. The restaurant is applying for permits and hopes to begin construction in the fall. Mr. Arias says his father, anxious to spread his wings, may begin offering what the younger man calls ''more elite plates.''</p>
        <p>Let's hope that means more Oaxacan dishes. ''Sometimes Mexican restaurants in the States think that Tex-Mex is what the gringos want,'' Ms. Trilling, the cookbook author, told me the other day in an interview from her cooking school on a ranch outside the city of Oaxaca. ''The food might be good, but it doesn't taste like the earth.''</p>
        <p>That is an apt criticism of Charrito's. Oaxaca has seven great moles (only two of them include chocolate), and if Mr. Arias will make them, he'll have seven great reasons to lure diners back. Maybe he'll even mention them on the menu.</p>
