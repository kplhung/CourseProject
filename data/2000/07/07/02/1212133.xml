        <p>LAST month's groundbreaking ceremony for the Ridgefield Playhouse for Movies and the Performing Arts ended a wearying debate over public funding for the arts in the community. The 512-seat theater, which is actually a renovation of the town's old high school, has been six years in the making.</p>
        <p>The playhouse, which is scheduled for completion by Dec. 1, will present second-run movies and offer a stage to local performing groups like the Ridgefield Symphony, the Ridgefield Civic Ballet and the Patricia Schuster School of Dance.</p>
        <p>''It has been a long and arduous process,'' said Barbara R. Manners, a Democratic selectwoman and president of the Friends of the Ridgefield Playhouse, ''but it's finally becoming a reality.''</p>
        <p>Despite Ridgefield's affluence (the average annual family income is $103,000), it offers just two performing arts venues (the auditorium at the Ridgefield High School and the Ridgefield Workshop for the Performing Arts) for its 22,000 residents. Ridgefield's few performing arts organizations survive on box office receipts and private donations. One large obstacle in starting a publicly funded playhouse was citizens' concern over money, said State Representative John H. Frey, a Republican who lives in Ridgefield. Mr. Frey said that many people ''had the feeling that if the town voted to fund it and it failed, they'd have to take it over.''</p>
        <p>Martin F. Heiser, a member of the town's board of finance for six years and an opponent of public funding for the playhouse, is among that group: ''The town of Ridgefield is not in the movie theater business,'' he said. Ms. Manners countered that the town of Ridgefield is not ''in the business of running athletic fields either, but we have 22 of them.'' ''If the town helps support the athletic fields,'' she said, ''it should help support the arts.''</p>
        <p>The grassroots push for the playhouse began in 1994 when Ms. Manners and several other residents formed Friends of Ridgefield Playhouse. Ms. Manners said that when the group took a petition with more than 500 signatures and a feasibility study to a public hearing in 1995, the board of selectmen refused to bring the issue to referendum. ''They wanted to rent the building out and didn't want anything to interfere with that,'' she said. This prompted Ms. Manners to run for first selectman against the Republican incumbent, Sue Manning. ''The lack of openness on the board was so frustrating that I ran for a more open government,'' Ms. Manners said. ''I didn't expect to win, but it was close.'' Ms. Manners lost to Ms. Manning by 452 votes. A member of the Friends group, Madeline Jelinek, said: ''Although Barbara lost that election, what came out clearly was that people were really behind the arts center. Barbara was virtually an unknown candidate whose sole visibility was the arts center. I believe that the selectmen realized that this was not just a pipe dream.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Manning, who stepped down in 1997 after 10 years in office, said, ''The Friends' proposal for renovation was too expensive.'' Mr. Heiser agreed, adding that the proposal essentially requested ''a blank check'' from the taxpayers. ''Neither myself nor any other people in town oppose a playhouse in Ridgefield,'' he said. ''I opposed it as an open-ended project.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Manners responded that the proposal ''was never presented as open-ended; it only requested help in restoring the facility and not its operation.'' After rejecting two proposals costing more than $1 million, the board of selectmen approved $950,000 in March 1997. After the board of finance voted that down, the newly elected board of selectmen, led by then-First Selectman Abraham Morelli, voted to give the Friends group $750,000 with the caveat that they raise $200,000 first. The group raised the money by September and hoped that its dream was close to materializing.</p>
        <p>''Then we hit another snag,'' said Ms. Manners, who was elected a selectwoman in 1997. ''We were stopped dead for five months last year because the facility was being considered as a potential middle school site.''</p>
        <p>The Friends' hopes were again temporarily dashed when they found more asbestos than anticipated. Once it was finally removed from the building, the group was set to break ground.</p>
        <p>After those two setbacks, the Friends group was happy to get a $200,000 state grant last January. Ms. Manners said the total raised to date is $1.55 million: $600,000 in private donations, $750,000 in Ridgefield town funds and the $200,000 in state funds. Ms. Manners credits Mr. Frey's persistent lobbying for nabbing the recent state grant.</p>
        <p>''John brought the director of the Connecticut Commission of the Arts to Ridgefield last year to meet with the playhouse board and tour the old high school auditorium,'' she said. ''John may be a Republican, but he's been very supportive in this process.'' ''It has taken a lot of time and energy and been very frustrating,'' Ms. Manners said, ''but we think the playhouse will be a cultural gem for the community.''</p>
