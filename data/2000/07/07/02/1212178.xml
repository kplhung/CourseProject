        <p>WILL the caring, dedicated insurance salesman -- mythologized for decades in television commercials, less frequently spotted in real life -- survive and thrive in a dot-com world?</p>
        <p>The insurance industry by nature is conservative and tradition-bound, preferring to stick with the tried and true and leave the risks and rewards of innovation to others. In recent years, it has managed to hold out against pressure to re-engineer around the demands of an Internet-driven economy. Meanwhile, other financial service industries like the brokerage business have been turned nearly upside down and inside out as customers flocked online.</p>
        <p>As shoppers logged on to buy everything from flowers to books to investments, they experienced a new kind of customer service: it did not always work flawlessly, but there it was, at three in the morning if you wanted it, and often at discounted prices. Customers came to expect information round the clock as part of the package. They adjusted, and in some cases came to prefer well-designed automated systems over human assistance. The approach expanded to other forms of customer service, including telephone-based delivery.</p>
        <p>''The insurance industry has come rather belatedly to the Internet, after a long time functioning as order-takers,'' said Herbert L. Rough, a partner in Comprehensive Planning-Goodman, a Hicksville insurance agency that recently unveiled a new e-commerce site.</p>
        <p>While agency owners and sales personnel have long valued the benefits of automation -- less paper to shuffle, reduced costs of handling business -- digitalization in the insurance business has largely been a back-office process. It is as if the industry has been watching, and believing, its own commercials where agents are lionized as saintly intermediaries, their customers emotionally pledging lifetime devotion.</p>
        <p>It just ain't so. Still, ''insurance agents are not going to disappear,'' Mr. Rough said. ''Somebody is going to have to talk to customers even in the age of e-commerce. It won't all happen automatically.''</p>
        <p>His two partners, Mark D. Levy and Phillip E. Goodman, are less bullish about the agent's future. The agent's traditional gatekeeper role is already being eclipsed on Web sites such as their own, where prospective customers can conduct their own comparative rate searches among such companies as State Life and United States Life, then apply directly to the carriers for coverage.</p>
        <p>''I agree the agents and brokers will survive, but they'll have to find a different place to swim,'' Mr. Levy said. ''They'll have to learn to compete on the Internet.''</p>
        <p>The CPG Web site, www.cpgllc.com, is one place where they can begin. It gives brokers and consumers access to a proprietary database of prices and products from more than 400 life insurance companies.</p>
        <p>''If you're a broker, you can sit at home Sunday night and prepare for the meeting scheduled for Monday morning,'' he said. ''The carriers' offices are closed, but you can log onto our database and find your quotes and print out the forms you need.''</p>
        <p>Brokers can also check the status of their clients' applications throughout the underwriting process, perhaps speeding things up if necessary. ''The real time saver is that if you're a broker you can do this online rather than through phone calls,'' Mr. Levy added.</p>
        <p>Marc Schwartz, a broker/agent with the Stiepelman Group in Rockville Centre, said the CPG Web site provides flexibility and efficiency.</p>
        <p>''I log onto their Web site and I get rates and terms in under 15 minutes,'' he said. ''It used to take me maybe two hours and plenty of phone calls and faxes. And CPG keeps me up to date with all the forms the carriers use that change all the time. Those changes are a pain in the neck, and they've eliminated that for me.''</p>
        <p>But the real cutting edge is a new part of the Web site that permits consumers to search for the lowest prices and apply online if they wish. By entering their own health information and other personal data, they can find the exact rates they will pay. Traditionally, carriers list the rates that are actually offered only to customers in the top age and health categories.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy and Mr. Goodman expect their Web site to turn some insurance consumers into online shoppers. They said that products that are largely price-driven, like term life, are most transferrable to Web site selling, but that other products like variable life require more complex decision-making, assuring the continuing need for agents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy compared the shift to the one that has taken place in the brokerage industry. ''Sure, you can buy and sell stocks in I.B.M. online, just you and your computer,'' he said. ''Obviously many people are doing that. In insurance, I see that happening with a commodity like term life. On the other hand, are you going to buy more sophisticated financial products like hedges without consulting someone in the industry you know and trust? That's the model I think the more sophisticated insurance products will follow.''</p>
        <p>Other types of insurance, including auto, property and casualty, are also moving onto the Internet. In Plainview, Barry Siegel's First Priority Group launched driversshield.com last fall with an eye toward capturing some of the $30 billion-plus collision repair costs that American drivers incur annually in 17 million roadside mishaps. Mr. Siegel markets driversshield.com directly to vehicle insurers as a place where their customers can locate participating repair shops, compare estimates and track repair status.</p>
        <p>''We've just decided to wholesale the technology to other companies so they can offer our Web site-based services under their own brand,'' Mr. Siegel said.</p>
        <p>The Internet's potential for bringing in customers and serving them is wildly overestimated, said Kevin Lang, president of DCAP Insurance of East Meadow, whose 65 offices in the New York metropolitan area make it the largest chain of independent retail insurance stores in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lang has never lost confidence in what the industry calls the eyeball factor: if you want someone's business, you've got to deal face to face.</p>
        <p>''The Internet is not going to wipe out the broker,'' he said. ''You can't simply do away with the personal touch. When you buy a car, you want to call your broker and tell him, 'Hey, I just got a new car, can you get the paperwork together?' The personal touch is what carries the day.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman is not so sure. ''The insurance industry is one of the last businesses in America to go online,'' he said. ''But shoppers are becoming more sophisticated. On the Internet, they can see all the things that are available to them, and it becomes easier to do business with us.</p>
        <p>''The old marketing approach was throw tons of brochures at people, talk to tons of people on the phone, and some of them will buy from you,'' he added. ''Clearly, this is far more efficient.''</p>
