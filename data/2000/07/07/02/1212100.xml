        <p>PROF. HAROLD HILL is back on Broadway, flashing $8 million worth of smile and what Meredith Willson termed his calling card of a suitcase. Nightly, the ''bang beat bell-ringin'  ever'-time-a-bull's-eye salesman'' dissolves into a lovesick puppy as theatergoers wallow unashamedly in the old-time corn-pone verities.</p>
        <p>Today's message: It isn't all make-believe. Out in the heart of what Willson called the ''hailstone and sarsaparilla belt'' exists the real River City. Its true name is Mason City, Iowa, and it is indeed a place of marching bands, barbershop quartets and dandy ice cream parlors. But it is more than that.</p>
        <p>Mason City, where Willson was born in 1902, has transformed his boyhood home into a Victorian gem, put a collapsing Frank Lloyd Wright house back together and plans to restore a Wright bank and hotel. Beyond Wright, it boasts one of the nation's finest collections of Prairie School architecture in an achingly picturesque, if slightly too arboreal, setting. What's more, the town's museum of antique trucks is nothing to sneeze at.</p>
        <p>A particularly charming attraction is the largest collection of puppets made by Bil Baird, another native son. Local lore has it that he gave the ''l'' in his first name to Willson.</p>
        <p>Mason City (population 29,040) is a few miles east of Interstate 35 about halfway between Minneapolis and Des Moines, and, truth to tell, represents nothing so much as a failed dream. Mason City was a big-thinking burg that figured it just might be the next Chicago. As a local history book published in 1911 put it, the then 60-year-old dot in Iowa's rolling prairie amounted to ''the most important town in a wide belt of the country extending from the Great Lakes to where the Golden Sands of our Western Coast receive the waves of the Great South Sea.''</p>
        <p>At the time ''The Music Man'' is set, the early 1900's, Mason City had five rail lines, four newspapers and four vaudeville houses. Local banks had assets of over a million dollars and, in the 1930's, would be paid the high compliment of a visit by John Dillinger's gang, which robbed the largest of $52,000.</p>
        <p>This bountiful sense of significance explains why Wright and people like Walter Burley Griffin working in the same direction -- a genuinely new American architecture -- were invited to build things. It was reflected in an emphatically middle-class appearance, from picket fences to the ample, instrument-filled home of Willson's youth.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the tranquil, timeless part of Mason City is now surrounded by strip malls, Wal-Mart and its imitations and enough fast-food joints to choke a teenager. And there is no passenger train to the town anymore, though there is talk of revving up the putt-putt  electric trolley that once ran to neighboring Clear Lake (it has occasionally been run for shorter distances). But the rosy vision of ''The Music Man'' resonates still in the footbridge across Willow Creek (alas, many times modified) and the stately oaks presiding over squeaky-clean streets.</p>
        <p>The fact is that America turned out differently from the dreamers' dreams. Chicago remained Chicago. But there are moments, particularly around twilight, when time seems to have stalled in Mason City, Iowa. It is almost possible to think it stopped entirely in 1912, the year of ''The Music Man.''</p>
        <p>The feeling is strongest in the summer when most visitors come: it has been a generation since disease killed the elms, but green canopies again blanket the streets, and cars with license plates from any number of states prowl about. In July and August, Mason City is hot and humid and feels like a destination.</p>
        <p>The Willson house, which was built in 1895, is suffused with light from expansive windows, a few of them stained glass. People have always wandered by to take a look, but five years ago it was acquired by a local foundation and opened to the public from May until October, otherwise by special appointment. What made our tour special was the lively commentary of Caralee Miller, one of 30 docents.</p>
        <p>Here is Meredith's cradle, covered with the quilt his grandmother made. We learn he was the biggest baby born in the county for many years afterward, a whopping 14 1/2 pounds. We learn that his mother, Rosalie, taught the town's first kindergarten class in her home. We learn that Meredith, the third child, had a sister, Dixie, who taught herself to play the harp in two weeks so she could give a recital at the Congregational Church. She later joined the circus and wrote a good book about her elephant-riding experiences.</p>
        <p>Instruments, many of which actually belonged to the family, are scattered about. The calendar is stuck forever on January 1912. There is evidence of Meredith's ultimate achievement on a blackboard where he choreographed stage movements for ''The Music Man,'' easily the most valuable thing in the house.</p>
        <p>Already you could sense the scale of his eventual accomplishments: attending what became the Juilliard  School of Music, then becoming John Philip Sousa's principal flutist and piccolo player without an audition, then first flutist for the New York Philharmonic. Cracking wise about Mason City on the radio with George Burns and Tallulah Bankhead. Writing ''May the Good Lord Bless and Keep You,'' on the basis of his memories of the Sunday school where his mother was superintendent of the younger grades. When he died in 1984, he was buried in Mason City to the salute of 76 trombones.</p>
        <p>Ms. Miller mentioned some coincidences uncovered  as local volunteers put the house together as a period piece. One was that the roller organ in the parlor can play only one song, ''Stars and Stripes Forever.'' This was the song for which young Willson dreamed of  playing the piccolo solo in Sousa's celebrated band.</p>
        <p>Next door to the Willson house is Marjorie's Tea House, which opened last August. It was the home of one of Willson's childhood chums, Marjorie Sale, who now lives in Virginia and is crowding 100. It is a nice little restaurant, offering Greek stew, roast pork and a light chicken sandwich on a typical day. The homemade brownies with butterscotch sauce were scrumptious.</p>
        <p>And this is only the beginning of Mason City's entrepreneurial approach to its heritage. A $10 million Music Man Square is being built next door to house theaters, a museum, rehearsal rooms and an indoor streetscape modeled on ''The Music Man'' set. It is opening gradually; the partly finished building was dedicated at the town's annual band festival last month  with a thousand-member barbershop quartet and 76 used trombones dangling from the ceiling. Ultimately, there will be a pool hall, soda fountain and barbershop, among other working stores, all to be finished by 2002, the centenary of Willson's birth. Rosemary, Willson's widow, now 78 and living in Southern California, is supplying $5 million and two grand pianos.</p>
        <p>The Mason City Foundation is also remodeling a nearby mansion as a bed-and-breakfast, and has its eye on an adjacent antiques mall as a site for a working bakery in honor of the yeasty profession of Willson's father.</p>
        <p>Across from the Willson house is the Mason City Public Library, a large Georgian-style brick structure built in the 1940's and still in use. Here dozens of handwritten notes from famous authors are displayed, among them Washington Irving, Samuel Johnson and George Bernard Shaw.</p>
        <p>Next door is the Charles H. MacNider Art Museum, a truly captivating place given by the philanthropic family who lived there. One is struck by the view of the creek and woodland from wide Tudor windows, but there is more. Lithographs by Grant Wood and George Bellows are outstanding, and Thomas Hart Benton's exuberant painting, ''Spring Tryout,'' depicting a young man trying to ride a spirited horse, is of a stature one expects of New York or Chicago.</p>
        <p>But the most whimsical attraction is the collection of Bil Baird's work from Broadway, the movies, television and two world's fairs. Virtually all the puppets from his production of ''The Wizard of Oz,'' performed in his Greenwich Village theater in the early 70's, frolic in one case. Another displays the puppets used in the film ''The Sound of Music.'' There are more than 400 puppets in all, as well as the artist's sayings and scribblings. ''When I make a puppet, I hang myself on straps like a lab specimen to make sure the motions are right, as written,'' one quotation said. Baird's Mason City roots are apparent from the display of the noted puppeteer Tony Sarg's production of ''Rip Van Winkle'' at a local theater during his teens. The show, he said, impelled him into the world of marionettes.</p>
        <p>A visitor leaving the museum finds himself on a street that is parallel to Willow Creek. This and the street across the creek are called the Rock Glen-Rock Crest National Historic District and are home to Prairie School houses designed by Wright's contemporaries. Walter Burley Griffin designed five of the eight houses, including one of craggy rock that local residents call The Castle and architectural historians term one of the first modern houses of the 20th century. Griffin would shortly go on to design Australia's new capital of Canberra, but his Mason City work is viewed as the Prairie School's apotheosis.</p>
        <p>It is a short walk, one accompanied by woodpeckers and songbirds, to another truly amazing building. Local people worked for years to painstakingly restore and move a house designed by Wright in 1908 to a nearby site. It was based on a famous plan for a $5,000 house Wright published in Ladies' Home Journal. At its lowest ebb, the Stockman House had become a dilapidated photo studio. Its restoration is intriguing because it is half pure Wright, including china patterns from Tokyo's Imperial Hotel. The other half reflects the tastes of the relatively affluent doctor's family who lived there. There is a bearskin rug and furniture from the Arts and Crafts Movement.</p>
        <p>The docents here are wonderful too. We caught up with one of them, Dr. Robert McCoy, a retired surgeon who lives in a nearby Griffin house. He told how borings were taken to determine the original paint, revealing hues considerably more autumnal than anticipated. He pointed out that Wright designed storm windows to be loaded from the inside, something not commonly done until after World War II. Most important, he showed how the house, built around a huge fireplace, flows organically. ''Every room is a destination,'' Dr. McCoy said. ''No room is a passage to another room.''</p>
        <p>Lovers of Wright should then head promptly for the corner of Federal Avenue and State Street. Here are a somewhat deteriorated bank, designed to resemble a vault, and a hotel, in the Prairie School style, that have lapsed into different uses. But the exteriors still clearly show Wright's intentions. The roof of the hotel is being rebuilt with state money.</p>
        <p>There is more in Mason City. In the town's Central Park, the newly restored monument to the 24 local sons who fell in the Civil War  is impressive. So is the tiny Suzie Q Cafe, which has nine stools (almost always filled), no tables and a fabulous pork tenderloin sandwich. For dessert, there is Birdsall's, an old-fashioned ice cream parlor that sells a swell ''turtle,'' a concoction involving ice cream, hot fudge, caramel and nuts. I had mine with black walnut ice cream.</p>
        <p>We wandered by Ransom's Pool Hall with its cigar store Indian and perpetual haze, but my 12-year-old son, Roy, was deemed too young to enter. And the click of balls sounded so enticing. Had that dratted Professor Hill beat us to the punch?</p>
        <p>We then headed for the Van Horn Collection, which specializes in trucks built before 1930, the year Lloyd Van Horn was born.  There are wonders in this place, including some 50 trucks. There is a 1920 General Motors circus truck with working calliope. A Saurer beer truck from 1912. A John Deere manure spreader from 1914. Antique gas pumps. The first snowmobile, made in 1917 from a Model T, and an immense collection of antique cream separators. Plus free coffee and cookies.</p>
        <p>There are even inspirational signs from an earlier time: ''If you are a self starter, the boss won't have to be a crank.''</p>
        <p>It seemed a good time for a drive. A few miles northwest of the airport, there is a spot in a cornfield visited by people from all over the world. It was here that a plane carrying the rock-'n'-rollers Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper crashed in February 1959. Just about anyone can tell you how to get there. The final half-mile is a hike across rich black loam. The site is marked by a small monument, a stainless steel guitar and records with each singer's name.</p>
        <p>Plastic flowers and handwritten notes were strewn about. There was a plastic pair of glasses like those Buddy Holly wore. The wind blew and in the distance trucks hummed along the Interstate. Somebody had written words those ''by God stubborn'' Iowans in ''The Music Man'' would surely endorse.</p>
        <p>''Pray not for a lighter burden but a stronger back,'' the note said.</p>

        <p>Correction:  July 16, 2000, Sunday  An article on July 2 about Mason City, Iowa, misstated the history of the building that houses the Charles H. MacNider Art Museum. It was built in 1920-21 and occupied by two families, and then served as a convent. The MacNider family bought the building in 1964 and turned it over to the city, but never lived in it.</p>
