        <p>CLOTT-George. Of Monroe Township, formerly of Jersey City on June 30, 2000. The beloved husband for twenty-eight years of Gertrude (Granet) and the late Edna (Braverman) Clott (1971). Devoted father of Nancy Clott, Janet and Stephen Rotter and Brooke Dale. Loving grandfather of Zoe, Jason, Steven and Stacy. During his lifetime Mr. Clott worked tirelessly to serve the Jewish community and civic groups in Jersey City. Services will be held at Mt. Moriah Cemetery on Sunday, July 2 at 11:00 AM. Should friends desire, contributions may be made to the George Clott Book Fund, Jewish Home at Rockleigh, 10 Link Dr., Rockleigh, NJ 07647. For information contact ''Gutterman-Musicant''</p>
        <p>CLOTT-George. The Officers and Members of the Board of Governors of the Jewish Home and Rehabilitation Center and the Jewish Home at Rockleigh note with profound sorrow the passing at age 92 of George Clott, Honorary Presi dent. George began a lifetime of support and devotion to the Jewish Home at the age of nine, and was committed to providing longterm care to those in need regardless of financial ability. His involvement will surely be missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Gertude, our dear and valued friend, his children and his entire family. May his name be for a blessing.
