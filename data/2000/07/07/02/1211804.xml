        <p>Letter from Dr Vincent J Fontana disagrees with Patrick T Murphy's opposition to safe-haven legislation, in his June 26 Op-Ed; says safe havens for newborns should be priority</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I disagree with ''Helping Parents Choose Wrong,'' by Patrick T. Murphy (Op-Ed, June 26). Safe havens for newborns should be a priority; they neither discourage adoption nor cause harm. The reason safe-haven legislation is being introduced in New York and other states is the disturbing increase in newborns being abandoned and murdered.</p>
        <p>Many of these young mothers are in denial of their pregnancies and have had no prenatal care. Often alone, with no means of financial sustenance and lacking family support, they are in a state of panic and are unable to deal with their newborns.</p>

        <p>Many of these young mothers are in denial of their pregnancies and have had no prenatal care. Often alone, with no means of financial sustenance and lacking family support, they are in a state of panic and are unable to deal with their newborns.</p>
        <p>Safe havens in New York City date back to the Civil War, when the Sisters of Charity set up a bassinet outside what is now New York Foundling Hospital to care for abandoned babies. But times changed, and today a mother can be prosecuted for leaving her child.</p>
        <p>Saving even one child's life is worth the effort.</p>
