        <p>BASEBALL DYNASTIES</p>
        <p>The Greatest Teams of All Time.</p>
        <p>By Rob Neyer and Eddie Epstein.</p>
        <p>Norton, cloth, $29.95; paper, $17.95.</p>
        <p>Ever since Bill James burst on the scene in the late 1970's, there has been a new formula for writing successful books on baseball. Mix offbeat (and sometimes incomprehensible) statistical data with sound historical research, throw in some unexpected conclusions and stir well with lively, often confrontational writing. In the hands of James, who is an excellent prose stylist and a refreshingly original thinker, the results have been rewarding. For his acolytes, like Rob Neyer and Eddie Epstein, the outcome can be more uncertain. In ''Baseball Dynasties,'' Neyer, who works for ESPN.com, and Epstein, a former front-office employee with the Baltimore Orioles and the San Diego Padres, have used a ''standard deviation score'' to rank the 15 best teams of the 20th century, with an eye toward three- to five-year runs of excellence. The list they have come up with includes a few surprises (the 1906 Chicago Cubs, the 1970 Baltimore Orioles and the 1986 Mets may raise a few eyebrows); their two sets of final rankings, headed by the 1939 Yankees, are bound to provoke more arguments. But that, of course, is the idea of books like this one. Neyer and Epstein are a little too enamored of their formulas but succeed in presenting their findings with a certain panache. Epstein mounts a persuasive argument against the continued reliance of baseball experts on batting average, and there are some delightful historical sidebars here, but the overall thesis of the book is sometimes hard to follow, let alone swallow.</p>
