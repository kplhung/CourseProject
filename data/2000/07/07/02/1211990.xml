        <p>Ah. Summertime.</p>
        <p>Why, you can venture outdoors, and party with mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus, ticks bearing Lyme disease and caterpillars waiting to emerge as gypsy moths. Or you can escape to the beach, as long as you're willing to pay a half-year's salary for a tiny saltbox, no view. Then again, to get away from the city, you probably need a car; to run it, you'll have to pay record gasoline prices.</p>

        <p>Ah. Summertime.</p>
        <p>Why, you can venture outdoors, and party with mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus, ticks bearing Lyme disease and caterpillars waiting to emerge as gypsy moths. Or you can escape to the beach, as long as you're willing to pay a half-year's salary for a tiny saltbox, no view. Then again, to get away from the city, you probably need a car; to run it, you'll have to pay record gasoline prices.</p>
        <p>O.K., so you could stay at home, too. Of course, you'd have to play electricity roulette with Consolidated Edison. But hey, at least there's a decent chance that your children will be moping as they hang around the house, thanks to the city's new mandatory summer school program for underachieving students.</p>
        <p>Summertime, and the living is easy? Maybe that was the case in 1934, when the Gershwins wrote ''Porgy and Bess'' and set it in South Carolina. But in 2000, in New York, summer is actually threatening to be kind of a bummer, with residents plagued by problems like outdoor pestilence, indoor power outages, high-priced summer rentals and ill-fitting summer sandals.</p>
        <p>No longer does summer automatically compute as the precious, stress-free cushion reinforced by sunny movies or golden memories. For some people, instead, there are so many expectations, expenses and pressures built into making summer a three-month whirlwind of great vacations, great camping experiences, great everything, that it may be tempting to simply declare: the heck with it.</p>
        <p>''The difficulty with summer,'' mused former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who, though generally pro-summer, is aware of the other side of the coin, ''is the difficulty you have with Christmas and Hanukkah.''</p>
        <p>''When Christmas and Hanukkah are approaching,'' he explained, ''you are overwhelmed by this feeling that you're supposed to be joyous. And unless you're joyous, you're miserable. Well, summer is Christmas and Hanukkah for three months. We're going to let you out from school, we're going to release you from your high-rise offices, and what we want you to do is have a good time. And it's too much of a challenge.''</p>
        <p>To be fair, summer can supply a year's worth of nice stories about nice people having nice experiences. And besides, some dyed-in-the-wool New Yorkers aren't about to let a few inconveniences and irritations block their passion.</p>
        <p>''If you are a New Yorker, you learned to roll with the punches a long, long time ago,'' said former Mayor Edward I. Koch. ''I'm in love with the summer. I'm in love with the winter.''</p>
        <p>Still, some New Yorkers who view a glass as half-empty insist, with an occasional wink here and there, that this summer promises to be especially stressful. Just look at the rising cost of sleepaway camp an average of $3,000 for four weeks; the ever-longer knots of traffic; the Cassandra-like warnings against fireworks and undercooked food being hazardous to your health; and, of course, the vagaries in the weather.</p>
        <p>But for anyone who has a car -- particularly a gas-thirsty sport utility vehicle -- this summer's big bane is the price of gasoline, which has almost doubled in a year. The spike has prompted some people to scale back or even cancel family trips and vacations, according to several recent surveys.</p>
        <p>Staten Island residents have to endure extensive road closings on the Outerbridge Crossing -- a major funnel to the Jersey Shore. On the New Jersey Turnpike, E-ZPass won't be ready this summer, as planned; on the Garden State Parkway, E-ZPass won't reach the beaches of Belmar until late July, and Cape May until late September.</p>
        <p>And once you get to the beach, you must pay skyrocketing rental prices, which, in some spots, like the Hamptons, are up to 20 percent higher than last year's, and almost double what they were five or six years ago.</p>
        <p>Then there are the pests. Last fall, the West Nile virus killed 7 people and sickened 62 others in the metropolitan region; the virus has been detected this summer in dead crows in Rockland County and in Bergen County, N.J. So to guard against creating places for mosquitoes to breed, some people are discarding birdbaths instead of just changing the water frequently, while others are forbidding children from playing at dusk.</p>
        <p>Keeping a close eye on your children is ever more crucial because of the growing number of bears popping up in the suburbs -- including one in Dobbs Ferry, in Westchester, last week. In New Jersey, some bears have killed livestock; some have rummaged through garbage cans and backyards.</p>
        <p>In the Great South Bay on Long Island, the biggest outbreak in more than a decade of the microscopic algal bloom called ''brown tide'' is threatening clams, scallops, oysters and other marine life -- as well as the livelihood of local fishermen.</p>
        <p>And in East Hampton, the main problem is the gypsy moth caterpillar. Bruce Cohen, who owns a public relations business in Manhattan, was reading the behemoth book ''Gotham'' on his deck in Water Mill last Saturday when a caterpillar, dark and hairy, fell on a page discussing New York City during the American Revolution. ''It landed on the British,'' he noted.</p>
        <p>Barry Murac, a broker at Cook Pony Farm Real Estate, says the caterpillars have chewed up so many tree leaves that some areas ''look as if they've been in a forest fire.'' And with caterpillars dropping their waste onto all objects, many residents have soaked their lawn furniture in their swimming pools, have been loath to dine alfresco and have pulled the tops down on their convertibles.</p>
        <p>''They're gross. They're disgusting,'' said Mr. Murac (referring to the moths, of course). ''I wouldn't want to be eating anything outdoors that's blackened or encrusted.''</p>
        <p>This year, the caterpillars have stripped off the leaves of about 60,000 acres of trees in New Jersey. The insect has a natural population cycle of 8 to 10 years, but the speed of this year's resurgence has surprised experts.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Forsell, the Essex County agricultural agent with the Rutgers Cooperative Extension service, told The Star-Ledger of Newark that damage from the caterpillar last year covered only 1,380 acres in Salem and Burlington Counties.</p>
        <p>One way to avoid the perils of nature is to stay inside, of course. But that isn't necessarily a respite -- particularly if the weather is scorching and the demand for electricity outstrips supply. Last July, Washington Heights suffered a 19-hour blackout. On Monday, eight buildings on the Upper East Side lost power, stoking fears of another blackout.</p>
        <p>Of course, with more people functioning as tireless cogs in a purring economy, the boundary between home and work becomes blurry, said C. Leslie Charles, the author of ''Why Is Everyone So Cranky?'' (Hyperion, 1999). From the inside of a cubicle, for 16 hours a day, summer may not feel different from the other seasons.</p>
        <p>For fashionable and entrepreneurial women, the must-have mode of transport this summer to dinners, parties and weddings is a sandal with a tight strap just barely thicker than dental floss and a sole so thin it could probably double as fax paper.</p>
        <p>As a result, some women say they have never seen so many blisters and Band-Aids on women's feet. Ever. To treat their wounds, some women keep a stash of Band-Aids in their purses and desks, as well as a pair of comfortable shoes for the office, to reduce the toe cramps.</p>
        <p>''There's no support group yet, but there probably should be one: Scarred Feet Anonymous,'' said Malaika Danovitz, an account executive at the Geek Factory, a high-tech company in Lower Manhattan. ''We just pray for the fall to come.''</p>
