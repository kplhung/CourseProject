        <p>IT is no secret that the rivalry between the software leaders, Microsoft and Oracle, is bitter. Still, the acknowledgement last week by Oracle that it financed a series of escapades intended to embarrass Microsoft provided some lively summer entertainment -- especially a Keystone Kops caper in which private investigators offered office cleaners $1,200 for the contents of a proMicrosoft trade group's wastebaskets.</p>
        <p>Yet in the cross-fire of invective that ensued, the two foes found some common ground in what is known as public choice theory, whose practitioners use economic principles to analyze government decision-making, especially the influence of special-interest groups.</p>
        <p>Microsoft, in a statement, declared that Oracle's shenanigans amounted to nothing less than ''dramatic evidence that Microsoft's competitors have engaged in a massive and ongoing campaign to unfairly tarnish Microsoft's public image and promote government intervention to benefit themselves.'' Translation: The government's antitrust case was a result of successful lobbying by Microsoft's rivals.</p>
        <p>Without regret or irony, Lawrence J. Ellison, the Oracle chairman, called his company's campaign ''a public service'' that brought hidden information to light. Oracle's private eyes failed to buy any garbage of the Association for Competitive Technology, a group that backed Microsoft in the antitrust case, but they did turn up documents showing that two similar groups, the Independent Institute and the National Taxpayers Union, were financially supported by Microsoft. Those documents were passed to reporters for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, who wrote articles about Microsoft's backing.</p>
        <p>''Left undisclosed,'' an Oracle statement said, ''these Microsoft front groups could have improperly influenced one of the most important antitrust cases in U.S. history.'' Oracle, too, seems to believe that public relations and lobbying can affect federal antitrust cases.</p>
        <p>Each combatant credits the other with impossibly potent lobbying prowess. And neither's conceit, of heroism or victimization, holds water.</p>
        <p>Public choice theory, to be sure, is a serious discipline. James M. Buchanan won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1986 for his public choice research, and two other Nobel laureates, George J. Stigler and Kenneth J. Arrow, have made important strides in the field. But applying public choice theory to federal antitrust actions defies logic at times. Do Microsoft's competitors have a stake in the suit? Of course they do. Do they deny that they were trying to lobby the case? Of course they do; they were just educating the government, they say. So would most any lobbyist.</p>
        <p>Such statements of the obvious do not show that the government is dancing to the tune of the Microsoft-bashing band. People who have worked in the Justice Department's antitrust division over the years say the arithmetic works like this: Since consumers rarely know what is going on, 90 percent of antitrust leads come from competitors. But fewer than 1 in 10 complaints by competitors prompt an investigation, and only a tiny fraction of those lead to a suit.</p>
        <p>''You have 350 smart people in the antitrust division to separate the wheat from the chaff,'' said Robert E. Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution and a former Justice Department official. And prosecutors say the most compelling evidence against Microsoft came from the company's own documents and e-mail, not from anything competitors supplied.</p>
        <p>PUBLIC choice theorists suggest that politics was behind the Microsoft case, noting that the senior Justice Department officials are political appointees and that the 19 state attorneys general are elected officials. Yet the suit has never been much of a populist cause. Microsoft and Bill Gates personally retained very favorable poll ratings throughout the trial.</p>
        <p>But law enforcement is not supposed to be done by referendum. The Justice Department is a law enforcement agency, and the judiciary is institutionally independent from the other branches of government. Mr. Buchanan, the public choice pioneer, has noted that the framers of the Constitution wisely used separation of powers and an independent judiciary to curb the effects of self-seeking special interests on government.</p>
        <p>Reasonable people can disagree about the Microsoft case. Microsoft believes that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who found the company a monopolist that has repeatedly violated antitrust laws, was mistaken. That is now a matter for the federal Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court. Lobbying or image campaigns or public choice theory will not affect the outcome; no use bidding for wastebaskets now.</p>
