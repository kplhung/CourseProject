        <p>I HEARD you played in the N.B.A.,'' said the fifth grader who was bouncing a basketball between his legs, a yarmulke sliding down his head. ''You play in the N.B.A.? Who with?''</p>
        <p>''Yeah, yeah,'' said the 6-foot-8-inch man with the neat mustache, looking down with a smile. ''Played with Michael and Moses.''</p>
        <p>''You playing now?'' asked another boy at the basketball camp in Fairleigh Dickinson University's Rothman gym. Whats your name?''</p>
        <p>''Willoughby,'' said the man with a shy laugh. ''And I go to school now, just like you.''</p>
        <p>A quarter-century ago Bill Willoughby, the big man with the shy laugh, had quite a game. He played just down the road, at Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood, where he was on every All-Everything team. Coaches from around the country were amazed at how Mr. Willoughby soared and dunked and shot and rebounded and passed. Ray Jones, an assistant coach at the University of Cincinnati, tried to recruit him. Eventually, he signed a letter of intent to play at the University of Kentucky.</p>
        <p>''He was Magic Johnson before Magic Johnson,'' one college coach said recently of Mr. Willoughby's skills. ''Kobe Bryant before Kobe Bryant.''</p>
        <p>In the end, he decided to enter the National Basketball Association draft -- the same year as Darryl Dawkins. By doing that, the two young men were the first to enter the N.B.A. draft out of high school. Mr. Willoughby was drafted as the first player in the second round by the Atlanta Hawks and given a $1.1 million contract over five years -- chicken feed in today's high-priced N.B.A. draft but substantial 25 years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Willoughby never really blossomed, however. Over nine years in the National Basketball Association, he had some bright moments, but mostly rode the bench for six different teams. He averaged 6 points and 3.9 rebounds over his 488-game career. But at age 27, when many N.B.A. players are maturing, Mr. Willoughby was gone.</p>
        <p>''I had lost my desire,'' he said, sitting in a trainer's room at the Rothman gym. ''I was beaten down. And when you lose that, well, it all goes downhill from there.''</p>
        <p>He filed a succession of lawsuits against agents and lawyers whom he claimed mismanaged his finances. While the suits worked their way through the legal system -- eventually availing Mr. Willoughby nothing -- he worked with youths at basketball clinics.</p>
        <p>''When I met him nearly seven years ago, he was just about out of money and had to live in the house he had bought his mother years before,'' said Mel Davis, the executive director of the N.B.A.'s Retired Players Association, himself a former player. ''I couldn't let him waste his life.'' Mr. Davis advised Mr. Willoughby to go to college.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Willoughby is one course away from his bachelor's degree in communications at Fairleigh Dickinson. The 43-year-old bachelor has had his education subsidized by the N.B.A.'s Retired Players Association and isn't worried that it's too late to start a new life after graduation.</p>
        <p>''Not that I had a bad life,'' Mr. Willoughby said. ''But I want to be able to motivate young kids today. People say, 'Would you advise kids not to come out of high school and play in the N.B.A.?' No, that's not it. But I want every kid, from the little ones to the great players, to know what they are up against.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis said Mr. Willoughby's breakthrough came in the summer of 1994, when he asked his friend to speak to the rookie class at the N.B.A.'s orientation session, a class with the eventual All-Stars Grant Hill and Jason Kidd.</p>
        <p>''We worked on that talk for three months, at least two hours a day, three days a week,'' said Mr. Davis.</p>
        <p>The speech, Mr. Willoughby remembered, was from the heart.</p>
        <p>''I talked about how to make sure you had control of your basketball life, of your finances, to make sure you had some people at home caring for you,'' he said. ''And I wanted them to know that they should already be planning for their time after basketball.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis said most of the young players there had no idea who Mr. Willoughby was, but gave him polite applause when he was introduced. ''When he was done, there was a standing ovation,'' he said. ''There was not a dry face there, and that included executives and Jason Kidd and Grant Hill.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Willoughby says things might have been different had he come out of high school today into the N.B.A.</p>
        <p>''Back then, there was little dunking, no 3-point shot, no 6-foot-8 point guards, which is where I should have played instead of forward and center,'' he said. ''But the big thing was that there were no other 18-year-olds.</p>
        <p>But worse than on the court, he said, was life the off the court. On the road, even though he never felt snubbed by his teammates, he couldn't go clubbing with them because he wasn't 21. At home, he was young, shy and unmarried.</p>
        <p>''They would go home and have a family,'' he said. ''They might invite me over for dinner, but I was like an older kid. I just never really adjusted.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps Mr. Willoughby's shining moment in the N.B.A. was in the 1981 Western Conference playoffs, when, playing for the Houston Rockets, he came off the bench to block three sky hooks by the Lakers' Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -- a man six inches taller than he was. The next year, Mr. Willoughby started half the games for the Rockets, but a hand injury kept him on the bench at the end of the season. He bounced from the Rockets to the San Antonio Spurs to the New Jersey Nets over the next three seasons. Then he retired.</p>
        <p>He said he never felt deprived growing up, with uncles teaching him new basketball skills and parents and two older sisters at home. He slid through academics in high school, he said, often getting A's and B's in the first semester and then slacking off to C's in basketball season.</p>
        <p>''But we didn't have much money and when the pros came with the money, it was hard not to go,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Now, he said, he gets mostly B's in his college classes as an anonymous older student.</p>
        <p>''No one recognizes me, and that is just fine,'' he said. ''I've had that. I don't need to be somebody's basketball hero now.</p>
        <p>But he does want to be someone's hero.  And he has just the model -- his own boyhood hero, Julius Erving.</p>
        <p>''We were kids and we went out all the time to 128th and Madison to see the Rucker League games,'' said Mr. Willoughby, referring to the New York City summer league that often attracted pro players. ''It was ninth grade, just the time when you can go bad. One day, we saw Julius Erving coming out of a game, where he probably had scored 40 points. He was there with his wife and we went up to him.</p>
        <p>''My friends told him I was scoring 40 points a game and stuff and he said, 'Wow!' and just started talking to us,'' Mr. Willoughby remembered. ''Nothing big, just saying to get the best out of our skills and live right.</p>
        <p>''That changed my life,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Davis wants Mr. Willoughby to change lives for a living.</p>
        <p>''He would be a great ambassador for the game,'' Mr. Davis said. ''I think there could be a job with one of the teams or even the N.B.A. for him, he's so good at speaking about all aspects of the off-the-court game now,'' said Mr. Davis.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Willoughby put it: ''I might not have become Michael or Shaq, but I believe I can communicate what it is to do with life. That's why I took the challenge of going back to college. It's never too late.''</p>
