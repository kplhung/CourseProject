        <p>Hal Bernson, a Los Angeles city councilman, did not mince words.</p>
        <p>''I think that this city may regret the day that it ever voted to bring this convention here,'' he declared, summing up the city's growing anxiety about the possibility of demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention there next month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bernson was responding to a warning by the Los Angeles police of the potential for ''a level of activity'' at least as intense as the violent protest that disrupted a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle last December. Responding to those concerns, the council approved a plan to cordon off protesters in a fenced-in parking lot, and the Secret Service revised plans for lodging Vice President Al Gore in a nearby hotel. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit against the restrictions.</p>
        <p>The jittery mood was a counterpoint to the placidity of the campaign elsewhere. As has become almost pro forma in the campaign, another multi-billion-dollar spending plan was put forth by a presumptive nominee: Mr. Gore unveiled an energy plan that he said would authorize $148 billion over 10 years to improve mass transportation and decrease dependence on oil.</p>
        <p>''I have never been afraid to take on big oil,'' Mr. Gore said, an obvious dig at his rival, Gov. George W. Bush, a former oilman. Mr. Bush, however, said Mr. Gore was fooling no one, as a member of an administration that has seen a 50-cent rise in the cost of gasoline in recent months.</p>
        <p>A new dynamic in the debate was fostered by the rise of Ralph Nader, who after securing the Green Party nomination for president did not wait long to ridicule the vice president as ''a gee-whiz techno twit'' who had abandoned the disenfranchised in favor of large corporations.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Nader's words threatened to liven the race up a bit, so did the ruling on Tuesday by the United States Supreme Court, striking down a Nebraska law that banned a procedure known as a partial-birth abortion. Mr. Gore used the decision to remind voters of Mr. Bush's opposition to abortion rights. ''His views about choice are really quite extreme,'' the vice president said.</p>
