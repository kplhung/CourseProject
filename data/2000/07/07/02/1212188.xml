        <p>NO matter what road you used to take to professional summer theater, odds are it will no longer lead you there.</p>
        <p>If you're wondering what's on at Candlewood Playhouse in New Fairfield, Sharon Playhouse or Coachlight Dinner Theater in East Windsor, you've been out of town or out of touch. All were once upon a time destinations for Actors Equity-standard musicals, only more so for people who lived nearby than for long distance drivers.</p>
        <p>These were not community theaters, but theaters for their communities, where audiences were evidently too small to support shows bound by union contracts. Accidental tourists did stop by, but not in droves.</p>
        <p>Somehow, Coachlight had both a Connecticut and a Springfield, Mass., address, and Sharon has a foothold in the Berkshires. Now, that's where the musicals are, so savvy Connecticut theatergoers just keep driving  past the highway of memories and into a real song and dance wonderland.</p>
        <p>We're not talking summer stock, but selective theater for all seasons. And even though the Berkshire Theater Festival in its 72nd season in Stockbridge and Barrington Stage, just beginning its 6th in Sheffield, are summer theaters, that's a mere technicality. That two musical productions of rare excellence are now playing on those stages happens to be the sort of blessed confluence of events a musical theater aficionado dreams of.</p>
        <p>And it's not just musicals. After ''Camelot'' in Stockbridge, Lillian Hellman's 1960 play, ''Toys in the Attic,'' is to open under the direction of John Tillinger, a Roxbury resident, formerly literary manager at Long Wharf in New Haven. At the Unicorn, the theater's second stage, a new play by Katharine Houghton, a well-known habitue of Old Saybrook and Ivoryton, closed yesterday.</p>
        <p>Next month, Rob Ruggiero, associate artistic director of Theater Works in Hartford, will stage the musical, ''No Way to Treat a Lady'' at Barrington Stage, which has shared productions with Mr. Ruggiero's home theater -- an important  alliance between regional theaters, and an ever-growing trend in or near the metropolitan area. Clearly, theater professionals, not just theatergoers, from Connecticut also keep driving, and we haven't even reached the two stages in Williamstown.</p>
        <p>Although the season has just begun, Eric Hill is already the standard bearer for the well-traveled director. The happy journey of Mr. Hill, from the Connecticut Repertory Theater in Storrs, where he is associate artistic director, to the Berkshire Theater Festival in Stockbridge, Mass., is not his first. People are still talking about his triumphant staging last year of ''Moby Dick -- Rehearsed,'' in the Orson Welles adaptation. Currently, his chamber version of ''Camelot'' is revelatory, a testament to the abundance of the imagination, to the victory of heart and soul over sequins and scenery, of the mind over what does not matter.</p>
        <p>But wait. ''Camelot,'' a chamber piece? Isn't that most ornamental pageant about King Arthur, the noble Knights, the Royal Court, meant to be a visual knockout? Actually, in conception, no.</p>
        <p>In his great theater memoir, ''The Street Where I Live,'' the lyricist and librettist Alan Jay Lerner, wrote of his own epiphany, well after the troubled Boston opening of ''Camelot'' in 1960. It was after he wrote it that he realized why he wrote it, and then revisions of an elephantine script came easy. It's all about the last three pages, Mr. Lerner discovered. That's when a small boy appears, wishing to be a knight, not knowing that the Round Table was dead. ''Arthur realizes that as long as his vision is alive in one small heart he has not failed,'' Mr. Lerner wrote in his memoir. ''Men die but an idea does not.''</p>
        <p>The perilous evolution and ultimate success of ''Camelot'' is well documented in theater history, especially in Mr. Lerner's account, yet for 40 years, revivals have gone on as big shows, or as big as they could get in small theaters. That is not Mr. Hill's way in the 410-seat Berkshire Theater where King Arthur's vision of a time of fullness means fullness of spirit, a grand ideal. And it is all witnessed by a boy sitting under a tree, reading ''The Once and Future King.''</p>
        <p>Though there is no place here for Tom Story's show biz excesses as ''the medieval delinquent'' Mordred of the ''swampy little mind,'' the rest of the cast blends into Mr. Hill's conception. Richard Poe, most recently seen as the unsavory Judge Brack in ''Hedda Gabler'' at Long Wharf, is heart-stoppingly devoted to Guenevere; ''ill at ease in my crown till I met you,'' he says to his queen-to-be, and one can hear pulses flutter. But his wrenching self-doubt grows in a many-shaded performance that emphasizes inner turmoil and personifies the civilized theme of the work.</p>
        <p>Lancelot's sense of divine purpose, a monumental ego trip by Robert Goulet, who sang ''C'est Moi'' (and meant it) in the original production, is balanced, believable and finally moving in Lewis Cleale's restrained performance. It would be so easy to turn the spotlight on ''If Ever I Would Leave You'' -- the score's hit song, after all -- but Mr. Cleale's limpid singing and Mr. Hill's truthful staging make of it an integral dramatic, as well as musical, moment.</p>
        <p>That's class.</p>
        <p>When Lancelot, having stunned the court with a life-saving miracle, is to be knighted, Arthur says to him and to Guenevere: ''Before we throw ourselves into pomp and ritual, I think the three of us should have a quiet drink together.'' Mr. Hill invites his entire audience to drink.</p>
        <p>Given its sentimental and historic resonance, one expects to be moved by ''Camelot,'' though it is hard to remember a more soul-satisfying rendering than Mr. Hill's.</p>
        <p>But the presumption of cynicism, if not sheer sarcasm and negativity, has beclouded ''Company.'' Praised  for steely brilliance of concept and design, the Stephen Sondheim-George Furth musical about a bachelor and ''those good and crazy people,'' his married friends, has been all too commonly perceived as a threatening heartless urban show, by all measure, the flip side of ''Camelot.''</p>
        <p>It is no such thing in Julianne Boyd's unutterably moving, very funny and complete production at Barrington Stage in Sheffield, Mass. If ''Company'' is ambivalent about marriage, it is as ambivalent about New York, ''the city of strangers.''  Still innovative after 30 years, ''Company'' interweaves songs and vignettes with amazing grace. Ms. Boyd is tuned in to its musical demands, lyrical beauty and intricacy;  trusting and admiring of its extraordinary structure. Her ''Company'' is an ensemble, true to the show's title on a new level.</p>
        <p>To one who saw the original Broadway production six times, and is still counting others, including the recent Roundabout Theater revival on Broadway, this is the most emotionally-centered ''Company'' of all. In spite of a peculiar, hard to figure scenic design, tt rates a detailed analysis and appreciation of every scene.</p>
        <p>When has Amy's hysterical song, ''Getting Married Today,'' a case study in manic emotional chaos, the centerpiece of a hilarious scene, made an audience weep? It is a treat to hear Sondheim songs, pure and complicated, at the source, in contrast to all those tributary revues that contrive their own inane contexts. Ms. Boyd's vision of ''Company'' is revelatory.</p>
        <p>But wasn't that said about Mr. Hill's ''Camelot''? Now, drive, everybody, drive.</p>
