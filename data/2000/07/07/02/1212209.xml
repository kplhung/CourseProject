        <p>Music in Her Own Words</p>
        <p>For a long time, Mae Robertson tried to make people comfortable. Then she tried to put them to sleep. Now she wants them to wake up and listen to something new: her own words and music.</p>
        <p>The comfort came first, in the form of Cottontails, natural-fiber clothing stores that Ms. Robertson, a Larchmont resident, operated from 1984 to 1997 in Westchester and Connecticut. She gave up that business to devote more time to her music career, which had blossomed with the release of three collections of lullabies, bedtime renditions of traditional folk songs and contemporary music, from Elvis Presley's ''Love Me Tender'' to the Talking Heads' ''This Must Be the Place.''</p>

        <p>Music in Her Own Words</p>
        <p>For a long time, Mae Robertson tried to make people comfortable. Then she tried to put them to sleep. Now she wants them to wake up and listen to something new: her own words and music.</p>
        <p>The comfort came first, in the form of Cottontails, natural-fiber clothing stores that Ms. Robertson, a Larchmont resident, operated from 1984 to 1997 in Westchester and Connecticut. She gave up that business to devote more time to her music career, which had blossomed with the release of three collections of lullabies, bedtime renditions of traditional folk songs and contemporary music, from Elvis Presley's ''Love Me Tender'' to the Talking Heads' ''This Must Be the Place.''</p>
        <p>Now she has a new album, ''Stone by Stone,'' released last week on the Lyric Partners label, which showcases a different kind of song: her own.</p>
        <p>From the first notes of the title track, it's clear that Ms. Robertson's Alabama roots have not been erased by her time up North. (Indeed, she will soon be leaving, moving back down South.)</p>
        <p>But while there is clearly country in this music, it's not the foot-stomping, honky-tonking kind of country. Think wistful, not wild. Yes, loves were lost, but the memories that linger are more sweet than bitter. It's music to put on when it's time for a slow dance, even if your dance partner is only available in your dreams.</p>
        <p>Auditions, Anyone?</p>
        <p>The Hoff-Barthelson Music School in Scarsdale is scheduling them.</p>
        <p>It is looking for students to join its Festival Orchestra and adults to join its Festival Chorus. The orchestra, whose members do not need to be enrolled at the school, performs four times a year, often with professional guest soloists like the flutist Paula Robison and Glenn Dicterow, the New York Philharmonic concertmaster. Orchestra auditions are scheduled Sept. 14, 19 and 26 from 6 to 10 p.m. Auditions for the chorus, which performs works from the classical choral repertory, as well as jazz and pop standards, will take place at the group's regular Wednesday night rehearsals in October.</p>

        <p>Westchester as Movieland</p>
        <p>Before Titanic's iceberg, there was another famous piece of cinematic ice -- this one linked to moviemaking in Westchester.</p>
        <p>It's the ice floe where Lillian Gish lay adrift, her hand and hair trailing in the numbingly cold water, in the 1920 D. W. Griffith film ''Way Down East.'' The actual scene on the ice was filmed at White River Junction in Vermont. But, according to an article written by Jean Sapione for the Westchester County Historical Society, Ms. Gish prepared for her blizzard scenes by going for walks in winter gales and taking cold baths in the Mamaroneck home she was renting near Griffith's studio. ''An early March snowstorm obligingly swept in off of Long Island Sound,'' the article says, enabling the film crew to get ''several good close-ups of Lillian's ice-encrusted eyelashes and windburned face.''</p>
        <p>There's much more of ''Westchester in the Movies'' in an exhibition in the Museum Gallery at the White Plains Public Library.  Griffith, who never thought small, transformed the 28-acre Orienta Point estate where he built his studio into 18th-century Paris for ''Orphans of the Storm'' (1921) and hired hundreds of local residents as extras for this drama of the French Revolution. In ''America,'' released in 1924, he brought another revolution to Westchester, filming Paul Revere's ride in Mamaroneck and the Battle of Lexington and Concord in Somers.</p>
        <p>Decades later, Westchester continues to be a popular setting for independent feature films as well as major studio productions and the exhibition has the photographs and posters to prove it -- thanks to a cooperative effort by the Westchester County Historical Society, the County Executive's Office and the Westchester County Film Office. For more information about the exhibition, which continues through Sept. 4, call (914) 422-1489.</p>
