        <p>NIGEL P. HART and Andrew Graham, both 33, are of like build and stature. And both are British expatriates in Boston.  But Mr. Hart hails from just outside London, and Mr. Graham is from Scotland.</p>
        <p>''We're quite different, but it works quite well,'' Mr. Hart said. ''As a true Scot he's happy to control costs, and as a true Englishman, I'm happy to conquer borders.''</p>
        <p>In any case, the fund of which they are co-managers, the $2.22 billion Putnam International Voyager, has given them cause to bury any differences. Its Class A shares returned 35.3 percent a year, on average, for the three years through June 23, compared with 12.2 percent for its peers in the foreign stock category, according to Morningstar Inc.</p>
        <p>To gauge a stock's worth, the fund focuses on a company's long-term return on capital -- taking into account earnings, depreciation, working capital and capital expenditures. The managers project that return on capital into the future and then discount it by using long-term bond rates particular to each market. The resulting figure is what they call the  real return on capital.</p>
        <p>''We believe that's the driver of underlying worth, because ultimately the return that management can generate is rewarded by the market,'' said Mr. Graham, who joined the fund last October. Their goal is to find companies with a real return on capital that exceeds 6 or 7 percent  over the next two or three years.</p>
        <p>The managers start with lists of small-capitalization stocks -- 5,000 in developed markets outside the United States and 2,000 in emerging markets. To whittle the total to 500, they screen the lists for various criteria. First, they look for companies with market caps of $500 million to $3 billion and for average daily trading volume of at least 500,000 shares. Moreover, they also make sure there are enough shares traded so that the fund can buy its position within 20 days without the purchases exceeding one-third of the average daily trading volume.</p>
        <p>In the final screen, the fund uses a proprietary model to correlate valuation and return on capital. Specifically, it calculates a company's enterprise value -- the market value of its equity plus total debt, minus cash and short-term investments -- and divides it by the company's after-tax net operating profits. The lower the resulting figure, called the E.V./Nopat multiple, the better, because the fund gets a higher return for a lower price.</p>
        <p>''It's a less easily manipulated figure than earnings per share, and it's relatively comparable across various markets,'' Mr. Hart said. ''E.P.S. is defined very differently in different countries.''</p>
        <p>The two also calculate a 12-month price target for each stock by dividing a company's enterprise value by its shares outstanding.</p>
        <p>They make their final cuts, to a portfolio of 130 or so stocks, by scrutinizing company management and business models to see if profits can be both sustainable and large. That requires extensive travel by analysts and managers alike; Mr. Hart and Mr. Graham estimate that they spend about half their time on the road.</p>
        <p>THOUGH the managers say they are indifferent to whether their prospects are growth or value stocks, the holdings generally fall into two camps: fast growers, with minimum annual revenue growth of 15 to 20 percent, and more mature companies that have undervalued assets or are good takeover targets. Companies in this second group may grow at different rates and sometimes are unprofitable.</p>
        <p>When any holding grows to more than 5 percent of the portfolio, it is automatically trimmed. And any stock that reaches their price target is reviewed: they either raise the target or prune the position.</p>
        <p>Because of their travel schedules, the managers often communicate via telephone and e-mail. Twice a week -- on Tuesdays and Thursdays -- they meet formally with their analysts to arrive at buy or sell decisions. On Thursdays, they also review currency, political and other country-related risks for the portfolio, as well as the ramifications of any overweighting or underweighting in individual countries or sectors.</p>
        <p>They are now finding the best values in Continental Europe, which accounts for about 60 percent of the fund's assets; Mr. Hart particularly sees bargains among financial services companies in Germany, Italy and France.</p>
        <p>One pick is Tecis, a German financial services and mutual fund company. Tecis has a wide range of products and a sophisticated sales force, Mr. Hart said, and is benefiting from Europeans' rising savings. While the business is relatively mature in the United States, he added, it is growing fast in Germany. He expects revenues to grow 35 percent, annualized, over the next three years, and return on capital of 30 percent over the same period.</p>
        <p>The fund bought shares in November at 35 euros each; they now trade at 99.95 euros. Mr. Hart's 12-month price target is 160.</p>
        <p>The managers also like Bulgari, the Italian luxury goods company.  ''In recent years, they've been following the Gucci model,'' Mr. Hart said, ''broadening their product lineup, increasing the number of stores and appealing to a bigger audience.''</p>
        <p>The company is also rebuilding sales lost during the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998, he added. He  predicts sales growth of 20 percent, annualized, over three years, and a return on capital of 36 percent.</p>
        <p>The fund bought shares in March at 10.5 euros, they now trade at 14  euros. The fund's price target is 16 euros.</p>
        <p>Another favorite is Tecan, a Swiss manufacturer of equipment used to automate pharmaceutical and biotechnology laboratories. The company is a market leader in a fast-growing sector, Mr. Graham said.</p>
        <p>''The whole drug discovery process is changing with the onset of genomic research,'' he said. ''The number of avenues of research has dramatically expanded, and companies need a way to explore all the ideas efficiently.''</p>
        <p>He forecasts three-year annual sales growth of 25 percent and return on capital of 40 percent. The fund bought shares in February at 800  Swiss francs; they closed on Friday at 1,561. His price target is 1,900 francs.</p>
