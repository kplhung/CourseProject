        <p>LAST week, Playboy magazine published nude photographs of Darva Conger, the 34-year-old emergency room nurse who agreed in February to wed the self-described real estate baron Rick Rockwell on Fox TV's ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' Their brief matrimonial union was subsequently annulled, unconsummated.</p>
        <p>In the wake of her television appearance, Ms. Conger assured the public that she did not intend to exploit her sudden celebrity by accepting the many offers that had come her way -- including posing nude on a Web site -- but she seems to have changed her tune.</p>
        <p>''I've never had any problem with Playboy,'' she explains in an article that accompanies a 10-page romp along an undisclosed beach in the August issue. ''It's amazing how comfortable I felt, maybe because everything was so professional and it was a natural environment. . . . I'm not a voluptuous bedroom bunny, I'm an outdoor person.''</p>
        <p>Sound familiar?</p>
        <p>''The pictures are beautiful and pure and natural. They're nude, but they still have a feeling of innocence.'</p>
        <p>-- Katarina Witt, Olympic ice skater, defending her appearance in Playboy, December 1998</p>
        <p>''There is a sensuality in art, and I wanted to use nudity to create an art of sensuality. . . . This entire experience has been a renaissance for me.''</p>
        <p>-- Farrah Fawcett, actress, defending her appearance in Playboy, July 1997</p>
        <p>''This is my legacy. I wanted to look pretty -- for the men in my life and for me. I was nervous, of course. . . . but I walked up to [Playboy photographer] Steve Wayda and pulled up my shirt: Ta-daa!''</p>
        <p>-- Joey Heatherton, entertainer, defending her appearance in Playboy, April 1997</p>
        <p>''It was actually part of my reawakening. From my Mediterranean background, I'm very European in my thinking, and Europeans aren't judgmental. To them, nudity is considered natural. I strongly believe the human body should be celebrated.''</p>
        <p>-- Faye Resnick, figure in the O. J. Simpson murder trial, defending her appearance in Playboy, March 1997</p>
        <p>''There was another girl shooting the day I was at the Playboy photo studio, and she was perfect. But . . . I didn't hate her, I didn't feel jealous. . . . We bring different things to the pictures. She brings beautiful  breasts, and I bring O.K. breasts and lots of personality.''</p>
        <p>-- Nancy Sinatra, singer, defending her appearance in Playboy, May 1995</p>
        <p>''This pictorial has totally changed me. . . . Playboy stripped me down to find the real Julie.''</p>
        <p>-- ''Downtown'' Julie Brown, former MTV celebrity, defending her appearance in Playboy, August 1998</p>
        <p>''I was shy. In fact, I was kind of a prude. I finally realized I had nothing to be ashamed of. I thought, why feel guilt about my sexuality? I'd been a child-woman all my life. It was time to be a woman.''</p>
        <p>-- Dian Parkinson, ''The Price Is Right'' TV model, defending her appearance in Playboy, December 1991</p>
        <p>''I'm really proud of the work I've put into my body. I'm 41. When I was 21, I didn't look like this. . . . Besides, my parents are never going to approve of what I do, anyway.''</p>
        <p>-- Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, defending her appearance in Playboy, July 1994</p>
        <p>''I know people are going to say, 'Why did you pose for Playboy?' Well, the answer is, I think the body is a beautiful thing. I know I was not supposed to have an affair with a married man, but I'm human, too.''</p>
        <p>-- Tai Collins, the former Miss Virginia who claimed to have been involved with Senator Charles S. Robb, defending her appearance in Playboy, October 1991</p>
        <p>''These pictures are a celebration of a new life for me. A new beginning. For the first time in my life, someone took the time to ask, 'Jessica, what do you want?' No one had ever done that before, certainly not the church. Playboy did.''</p>
        <p>-- Jessica Hahn, the former church secretary whose sexual encounter with the televangelist Jim Bakker led to the demise of his ministry, defending her appearance in Playboy, November 1987</p>
        <p>''I had the most fun when I posed with a 60-pound Burmese python. I love snakes and wanted to do a shot all covered with them. I was disappointed that there was only one; I'd envisioned six or seven.''</p>
        <p>-- La Toya Jackson, singer, defending her appearance in Playboy, March 1989</p>
