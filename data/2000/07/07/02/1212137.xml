        <p>FAR from the Eastern shores of the American Dance Festival and Jacob's Pillow,  summer dance gatherings in Colorado illustrate the surprising cultural vitality of the Rocky Mountain state as well as tensions, both financial and paradigmatic, affecting arts presenters nationwide. Three festivals in Boulder and one each in Aspen and Vail run the gamut of programming styles and means.</p>
        <p>Blazing a trail along a risky frontier is Boulder's Colorado Dance Festival, one of America's few dance-only presenters and widely considered one of its top three dance festivals. Despite drawing 400 students and 5,000 spectators, last season ended with significant debts and an inadequate operating budget.</p>
        <p>A chronic shortage of suitable dance spaces  pushed 1999 performances into the expensive Boulder Theater, where attendance was undermined by high ticket prices and increased competition from the city's Shakespeare Festival, Music Festival and Chautauqua series and statewide events like the Telluride Bluegrass Festival. As problems that afflicted the festival, Dr. Michelle Heffner Hayes, Colorado Dance Festival's 1997-99 director and now head of Cultural Affairs for Miami-Dade Community College, also cited a shrinking federal arts budget, declining corporate and individual donations, cyclical shifts in private foundations' financing policies and the lack of a permanent endowment.</p>
        <p>Dance Umbrella, for nearly 20 years Boston's leading showcase for diverse contemporary performers, underwent a similar crisis last January that its director-producer, Jeremy Alliger, referred to as ''a wake-up call'' for those who give and raise money. The organization is now advancing behind a rally of corporate and municipal support and major grants from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.</p>
        <p>Colorado Dance Festival nearly went on hiatus this summer to focus on restructuring before grants arrived from the Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund, the National Endowment for the Arts and state and local organizations. The Glenwood Springs Dance Festival, active since 1992, was less fortunate. It folded following the 1998 season, a year after the 29-year-old DanceAspen shut down.</p>
        <p>A global sweep distinguishes the Colorado Dance Festival, which Marda Kirn founded in 1982 and Dr. Heffner Hayes compared to the Sundance Film Festival. While providing a showcase for international stars and emerging artists, the festival has also given rare emphasis to non-Western dance, reflecting Boulder's interest in diverse artistic and spiritual traditions. The 1996-99 ''Let's Dance Together! The Americas'' series concentrated primarily on popular African Diaspora forms of North, Central and South America and their underappreciated connections with contemporary Western concert dance.</p>
        <p>But Boulder's support for multicultural art and dance in general, whether home-grown or imported, has been eroding amid rapid growth, spiraling rents and real estate prices, and an accelerating influx of affluent young white residents who favor outdoor recreation and mainstream entertainment. Space for Dance, a part of the nonprofit Boulder Dance Alliance, was a recent casualty. It provided support and affordable space to Boulder County dance groups, which multiplied from three in 1990 to at least 25 today. But after shuffling among temporary locations for several years, last summer Space for Dance  could not find an affordable, properly zoned home. Negotiations also failed to land it civic-use space alongside other cultural service groups within a downtown development project.</p>
        <p>This year, the Colorado Dance Festival will distribute city money originally budgeted for Space for Dance in a dance-space subsidy program. Moreover, its world-beat programming is on the rebound under the curatorship of Ms. Kirn and the direction of Katherine MacDiarmid, previously head of Florida's Mount Dora Center for the Arts, whose annual arts festival grew into one of the nation's best in two years under her administration.</p>
        <p>Colorado Dance Festival, running from Thursday through July 23 on the University of Colorado campus,  highlights emerging groups that integrate culturally specific traditions into a modern dance framework: Robert Moses' Kin, Rosanna Gamson/World Wide and Compagnie Nakissa. A faculty from the five continents will offer some 400 students a stunning array of classes, including West African, Afro-Cuban, Sufi, Persian, Kurdish, Middle Eastern folk, Bharata Natyam, Capoeira, Hip-Hop, Flamenco, Latin- and Euro-American-based modern and postmodern.</p>
        <p>Not every Colorado State dance festival organizer accepts a multicultural mandate to the same degree. Local standards and tastes should be the primary guide, according to Jean-Philippe Malaty, who,  with the former Joffrey Ballet principal dancer Tom Mossbrucker, directs the four-year-old Aspen Ballet Company and the Aspen Dance Festival. Running from July 12 through Aug. 5 at the Aspen District Theater, Aspen Dance Festival emerged in the aftermath of DanceAspen, which the City of Aspen presented once in 1998 after the founding organization went bankrupt.</p>
        <p>''Tom and I have very eclectic tastes, and we want to present things that we ourselves enjoy,'' said Mr. Malaty. ''But you can't dictate what you think people should see. You have to be in touch with your community and appeal to all sides of it with high-quality, well-marketed programming.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Malaty's and Mr. Mossbrucker's formula for broad appeal includes something classical, something modern, something ethnic and something up-and-coming. The programs include the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago, La Tania Flamenco Music and Dance, and the Aspen Ballet Company in David Taylor's ''Children's Rainforest Odyssey,'' as well as a mixed repertory featuring San Francisco Ballet guests and a world premiere by Nicolo Fonte. The Paul Taylor Dance Company closes the festival.</p>
        <p>Most dance festivals, Colorado Dance included, must pay for a year-round office for main seasons that last only a few weeks. In addition to marketing savvy, Aspen Dance Festival enjoys the administration of the Aspen Ballet Company, which in September will merge with Santa Fe Festival Ballet to become the Aspen Santa Fe Ballet. While Mr. Malaty and Mr. Mossbrucker like taking creative risks with their dance group, they are satisfied with tried-and-true festival programming. Furthermore, anything that the festival might lose on misfires, the Aspen Ballet Company can recoup with a wintertime ''Nutcracker.''</p>
        <p>But raising money has its challenges even in Aspen, said Mr. Malaty. Its wealthy residents, who typically make primary donations in first homes elsewhere, don't always give generously to Aspen's 165-odd competing nonprofit groups. Aspen Dance Festival keeps its lowest tickets at $18 for the 50 percent of its audience that consists of full-time residents.</p>
        <p>The 12-year-old Vail International Dance Festival, in similar environs, seems most securely financed. Its parent organization, the nonprofit Vail Valley Foundation, produces major international sports events and the annual American Enterprise Institute World Forum, headed by former President Gerald R. Ford, who lives in nearby Beaver Creek. Mr. Ford and his wife, Betty, a former dancer with and board member of the now-distressed Martha Graham Dance Company, are honorary directors of the Vail festival, which also benefits from the largesse of private donors like the philanthropist and arts patron Judy Alexander and the investment banker, lawyer and real estate developer Gilbert Giordano and his wife, Donna.</p>
        <p>Under its producing artistic director, Katherine C. Kersten, a former dancer and teacher, the Vail festival  emphasizes world-class ballet but also presents culturally specific genres that are familiar and accessible to resort habitues, like Irish step and Slavic folk, seen last summer. It also offers free lectures by festival artists, a conference for ballet teachers and intensive ballet training for 80 students and pre-professionals.</p>
        <p>The Vail festival performances, which run from July 20 through Aug. 12, include the Spanish classical company Ballet Victor Ullate de Madrid;  the Spanish Gypsy flamenco artist Manolete and La Rosa Flamenco Theater; the Washington Ballet, dancing choreography by the San Francisco Ballet artist Val Caniparoli; and the Paul Mitchell International Evenings of Dance, which feature principal couples from Pilobolus, the National Ballet of China, American Ballet Theater, the Boston Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, London's Royal Ballet and the Cleveland-San Jose Ballet.</p>
        <p>Two smaller gatherings suggest that, on one scale or another, Colorado festivals as daring as the Colorado Dance Festival can thrive without the security and glamour of an upscale resort setting. The Boulder Jazz Dance Workshop, attracting nearly 150 professional and amateur dancers from around the world for 14 days of intensive study with master teachers, celebrates its 22nd year from July 30 through Aug. 12 on the University of Colorado campus with a comprehensive jazz-based curriculum.</p>
        <p>From July 23 through 30, the Boulder campus will be host to the second annual Aerial Dance Festival, created by the 11-year-old Boulder company, Frequent Flyers Productions. A  workshop for 80-odd dancers features daily classes that include low-flying trapeze, upside-down movement, bungee and aerial hoop, fabric, pole and choreography.</p>
        <p>Like the Jazz Dance Workshop, the Aerial Dance Festival is financed largely by student tuition and ticket sales. But if the past is any indication, cozy and inventive gatherings like these can give birth to larger-scale developments in dance performance, programming and public support.</p>
