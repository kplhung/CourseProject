        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a longtime resident of Manhattan who has been forced from my home because of unconscionable rent increases, I supported all efforts to keep the rent increases on New York City's rent-stabilized apartments at  2 percent and 4 percent [''Raising the Rent, and Raising the Roof,'' June 11]. But what about the millions of city residents who live in unstabilized apartments and are subject to much, much higher increases?</p>
        <p>Tenants in these apartments, many of whom have lived there for years, have no rights whatsoever: landlords can raise their rents, with no notice, as much as they please --  and they do. Last year, my landlord ignored the messages I left inquiring about my upcoming rent increase until just three weeks before my lease was due to expire, at which point he raised the rent on my studio apartment by 20 percent -- $225 per month -- for a one-year lease, an increase I could not afford.</p>

        <p>Other landlords of unstabilized apartments are raising the rent much higher than that, and giving their tenants little or no notice. The free market has run completely amok, and legal controls are badly needed to protect the many New Yorkers who are not lucky enough to be living in rent-stabilized dwellings.</p>
