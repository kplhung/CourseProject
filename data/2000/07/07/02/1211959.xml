        <p>When the Republicans gather here this month for their national convention, to some it might be hard to tell the difference: Is this a political convention or a telecommunications trade show?</p>
        <p>While the main event at the convention here -- and the Democratic convention to be held in August in Los Angeles -- is, of course, nominating a presidential candidate, a big corporate sideshow is being planned as well. And in that effort, no single industry is better represented than telecommunications companies.</p>
        <p>The companies are writing seven-figure checks to local civic host committees. They are spending millions more laying hundreds of miles of telephone, cable, fiber-optic and high-speed Internet lines at the conventions. They are handing out hundreds of telephones, pagers and walkie-talkies to important politicians. And they are doing this to promote their products to a captive audience of power brokers -- along with their views on how Washington should decide a number of issues.</p>
        <p>''The issues facing the industry are huge,'' said Reed Hundt, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. ''Whether it is Bush or Gore, there will be a whole new crop of decision makers in government in 2001, and these new people will shape the industry.''</p>
        <p>More than most industries, telecommunications companies are affected by Washington. Since the landmark 1996 Telecommunications Act deregulated the industry, telecommunications has been transformed from a stodgy industry to one of the fastest-growing segments of the economy. Among the issues before the government: A debate over open access to high-speed Internet networks, the fight over local telephone companies entering the $80 billion long-distance market, the future ability of huge telecommunications companies to pursue still more acquisitions and the rules governing which companies can compete for the wireless spectrum.</p>
        <p>In addition, the political conventions give the companies a chance to showcase their latest technologies and wares, in real time and in real life, to lawmakers and journalists. From a marketing perspective alone, it hardly gets better than this: In Philadelphia, there will be 30 governors, the Congressional leadership, local elected officials, fellow business leaders and 15,000 national and international journalists -- all chatting on phones, using computers and transmitting information.</p>
        <p>The failure of this dazzling technology is not an option. Telecom companies have built extensive redundancy and backup to prevent any embarrassing technological troubles.</p>
        <p>''Every four years, we have the opportunity to showcase our technological prowess before an important audience,'' said Tony Cellucci, AT&amp;T's director for the Republican convention. ''To do that with such a large captive audience in one location is quite an engineering feat.''</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T has given more than $1 million to the Philadelphia 2000 host committee and a similar amount to the Los Angeles committee. AT&amp;T is also spending $8 million to $10 million to build new cellular towers at the Philadelphia convention site. The company will also provide 500 cell phones -- with Republican Party logos -- to Republican officials.</p>
        <p>A front-burner issue for AT&amp;T is its $58 billion acquisition of MediaOne Company, just approved by federal regulators, making AT&amp;T the nation's largest provider of cable, long-distance and high-speed Internet access. In coming months, regulators will take actions affecting how these companies unite.</p>
        <p>Of course, telecommunications companies are not the only ones jumping on the promotional bandwagon. Companies like US Airways,  McDonald's, Microsoft and Pepsico provided the bulk of the $40 million in goods and services raised by Philadelphia's host committee -- all tax deductible.</p>
        <p>For instance, General Motors, as it has for every convention since 1978, will lend 400 cars -- full-size models and sport utility vehicles -- to shuttle around the powerful. ''These are thought-leaders and opinion shakers,'' said Bill Noack, spokesman for G.M. ''We turn our vehicles over to them because it's a good way to expose our products to a diverse and influential audience.''</p>
        <p>For telecoms, however, all this is more than promotion. Conventions are a way to make money, too. With so many people talking on phones and using computer modems, telecom companies plan to turn a profit.</p>
        <p>''It's some combination of civic pride and economic self-interest,''  David Cohen, co-chairman of Philadelphia 2000, said of the telecom companies. ''We give them a direct opportunity to make money. That makes it easier for them to be a significant contributor.''</p>
        <p>Telecom participation in these conventions comes on top of campaign contributions the industry has already made to the two parties -- a total of $16.9 million in contributions to federal candidates and the two parties in this election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group in Washington. Two of the biggest corporate players at these conventions are the biggest soft-dollar donors as well: AT&amp;T ranks No. 1 with $2.2 million to both parties, SBC Communications comes in sixth with $1.1 million.</p>
        <p>Civic pride, too, plays a role since telecom companies tend to be prominent players on their local scenes. In Philadelphia, Comcast and Bell Atlantic-Pennsylvania, both with headquarters here, have given $1 million each to the host committee, and so has AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>In Bell Atlantic's case, the company is spending another $4.5 million to create a telecommunications network at the convention site that equals that of a small city: 8,000 traditional phone lines and a variety of cutting-edge transmission and Internet-access lines with names like DSL, DS-1 and ISDN. An additional $200,000 is going for promotional materials.</p>
        <p>''The exposure of Bell Atlantic to the media has tremendous value as we become a national and international presence,'' said Daniel J. Whelan, chief executive of the company. Just last December, federal regulators allowed Bell Atlantic to sell long-distance services to its New York customers. Moreover, Mr. Whelan added, Bell Atlantic ''expects to turn a profit'' from convention-related telephone use.</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles, host city for the Democrats, the local phone company is SBC Communications, which is seeking federal approval to enter the lucrative long-distance market and sell long-distance calling to 15 million of its Texas customers.</p>
        <p>SBC, the parent company of Pacific Bell, is a convention veteran. It used the 1996 Republican convention in San Diego to kick off its wireless phones. This time, the word is ''band-width'' -- the new telephone and Internet connections being laid around Los Angeles' Staples Center, where the convention is being held, to allow for high-speed data transmissions.</p>
        <p>''Our fat pipes,'' said Steve Getzug, spokesman for SBC, referring to the high-speed connections, ''will be a pretty incredible application. We want to show some amazing gee-whiz technology to capture the fancy of the media.''</p>
        <p>Still, no company -- telecom or not -- is making a bigger splash in Philadelphia than Comcast, the nation's third-largest cable company. Brian Roberts, president of Comcast, is co-chairman of the Philadelphia 2000 Host Committee. And Comcast owns  the First Union Center in South Philadelphia, where the convention will be held, and which is being renamed the ''Comcast-Spectacor Center'' for the duration of event. (Among Comcast's other corporate ventures are its ownership of QVC, the television-based retailer, the 76ers basketball team, and the E! Entertainment, Golf and Food cable channels.)</p>
        <p>Comcast has its dance card full of activities: Its regional cable network, CN8, will broadcast five hours of live convention programming daily using the $10 million studio Comcast built at the convention site for sports games. And it is dedicating 200 employees to this effort, which will be offered free to cable operators across the country, potentially reaching 68.5 million homes.</p>
        <p>Comcast will be sponsoring a fund-raising reception for 400 people honoring retiring Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., the Virginia Republican who helped steer the Telecommunications Act through Congress. The company is footing the bill for a 100-page media and delegate guide for the 100,000 people expected.</p>
        <p>It will also install Comcast kiosks there to demonstrate its high-speed Internet service and may sell political memorabilia on QVC.</p>
        <p>''These are people who have to make important decisions, and they are coming to our house,'' said Mr. Roberts, president of Comcast. ''This exposure may enhance our own credibility when we are explaining new technologies, and it's a unique onetime opportunity for elected officials to see Comcast. Policy makers can meet us first and remember our names, our faces and our products. And, for Philadelphia, it's our Super Bowl, our Olympics.''</p>
