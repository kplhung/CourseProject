        <p>ON its face, it is nothing more than hard work. Chinese-American families have been known to grumble when that time of year comes around, after Memorial Day, and the dragon boaters gather each weekend morning on the dock behind the boathouse in Flushing Meadows Park in Queens to prepare for the annual Dragon Boat Race.</p>
        <p>In the thickest, sweatiest hours of the day, 10 or 20 people at a time slip into the long, shallow, oar-powered boats, bereft of their graceful dragon heads and tails. Those, imported from Hong Kong, will appear for the races on Aug. 12 and 13. For now, the only adornments are thick life jackets with ''Hong Kong'' stenciled on their backs. And the loudest sound is the thumping of a drum that keeps the oars splishing.</p>

        <p>In the thickest, sweatiest hours of the day, 10 or 20 people at a time slip into the long, shallow, oar-powered boats, bereft of their graceful dragon heads and tails. Those, imported from Hong Kong, will appear for the races on Aug. 12 and 13. For now, the only adornments are thick life jackets with ''Hong Kong'' stenciled on their backs. And the loudest sound is the thumping of a drum that keeps the oars splishing.</p>
        <p>The annual Dragon Boat Race, and the weeks of arm-hardening preparation that lead up to it, demand a season when water tempts, not threatens. They need dock hands in breezy cotton shirts, like Michael Lau, 26, of Flushing. They require team captains like Eddy Almonte, 30, of Brooklyn, whose toughest job was enlisting 20 people from American Express, where he works, who could be on the water by 10 a.m.</p>
        <p>Dragon boat racing is a 2,000-year-old Chinese tradition, based on a legendary attempt to rescue a poet who drowned himself, and is popular throughout Asia. The New York version attracts plenty of non-Asians, about 40 percent, Mr. Lau estimates.  The Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival, as it is officially called, is run by Henry Wan, who greets people at the dock in a pucker-brimmed, Gilligan-style fishing hat. The race is now in its 10th year.</p>
        <p>''It's fun,'' said Lydia Chiu, an auxiliary police officer who was wearing a Dragon Boat 99 cap at practice on a recent Saturday. ''To do something, like, Chinese.'' She pointed out the only non-Asian on the boat, her lieutenant. ''He doesn't know how to swim,'' she said, cheerily.</p>
        <p>Ms. Chiu and a friend sat on the first set of narrow wooden slats (seat padding must be no more than a quarter-inch thick). Facing them, wedged into the bow and straddling a large drum, was May Wong, who preferred rhythm-keeping to rowing because it was less work, or as she put it, ''more fun.''</p>
        <p>As the boats lurched, then fell into an easy skim, Mr. Lau sped from one to another in a motorboat, sharing the lake with some small craft sailors, some of whom help out on race day, and two water-filled dragon boats that bobbed near the surface, awaiting rescue. ''They never capsize,'' Mr. Wan had said. ''Sometimes they submerge.''</p>
        <p>There were some hard-core competitors in the race, whose goal is to go to Hong Kong for the dragon boat finals, but on this day the novices prevailed.</p>
        <p>''I'm here to give you a two-minute lesson in how to steer,'' Mr. Lau told Barry Ko, who stood at the back of his boat with a long oar. Mr. Ko, a beginner on the Deloitte &amp; Touche crew, was trying gamely. His buddies tried to raise his pride. As Eric Chan, an oarsman, explained, ''He almost fell off the boat trying to get on.''</p>
