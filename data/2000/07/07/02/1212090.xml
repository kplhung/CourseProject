        <p>Imagining Baseball</p>
        <p>America's Pastime</p>
        <p>and Popular Culture.</p>
        <p>By David McGimpsey.</p>
        <p>Indiana University, $29.95.</p>
        <p>More ink has been spilled taking the measure of baseball than any other sport -- but not because of something inherent to the sport itself, David McGimpsey writes. It is because of the body of baseball fiction that has been encouraged by the money men behind the backstop and by artists and critics who are able to pack a lot of heat into the game as a metaphor central to the soul of America. In ''Imagining Baseball,'' McGimpsey, who teaches English at Concordia University in Montreal, tracks the tropes used to depict the game and its players in works ranging from Ring Lardner, Bernard Malamud and W. P. Kinsella to the more disillusioned books like ''Ball Four,'' ''Breaking Balls'' and ''The Fan.'' His analysis deftly illustrates what he calls ''the dialectics of baseball idealism'' at the heart of baseball fiction (as well as in nonfiction writers like Roger Angell, David Halberstam and Bob Costas), in which an image of a secure country at play confronts a dystopian picture of corrupt industry and locker-room scandal. The dialectical oppositions include baseball's pastoral origins and the reality of the big-city major leagues; baseball as a child's game played by men (hence the ''boys'' of summer); grass versus artificial turf; day games versus night games; sandlot ideals versus stadium economics; Bart Giamatti versus Pete Rose. McGimpsey is not so much convincing -- little argument is needed to show that baseball is both big business and the intellectuals' favorite -- as he is illuminating. His discussion is free of lit-crit cant and provides a set of images and vocabulary that allows readers of baseball fiction to see better what's going on in the text. After reading the book, parsing the play-by-play of announcers as well as the rhapsodies of hyperliterary fans becomes a pleasant sport itself.</p>
