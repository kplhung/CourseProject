        <p>One hundred twenty-five kilograms of cocaine was found yesterday near the rudder of a large tanker in New York Harbor, the United States Coast Guard said.</p>
        <p>Workers on a small boat repairing the tanker called the Coast Guard when they found a package in the vessel's rudder well. The package was found to contain cocaine, the Coast Guard said.</p>
        <p>The repair vessel Twin Tubes had been working on the 593-foot Liberian-flag hazardous-materials tanker, which was anchored just off Bay Street on Staten Island north of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, when they found the package, said Petty Officer Angelo Patti, a Coast Guard spokesman.</p>
        <p>The tanker, the Timashevsk, was undergoing repairs to its propeller, which was damaged yesterday when the vessel hit a navigation buoy at the entrance to New York Harbor, Petty Officer Patti said. The Coast Guard discovered the cocaine about 11 a.m., he said.</p>
        <p>The Coast Guard contacted the United States Customs Service and the Police Department, which are investigating, he said.</p>
