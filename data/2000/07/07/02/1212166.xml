        <p>I WAS disappointed by Hubert B. Herring's article ''Coping with Luxury Fever'' (June 25). His stilted view of current luxury trends offended me.</p>
        <p>I was disturbed to see that he used only a few select points from Robert Frank's book ''Luxury Fever'' to illustrate his ire. The quotes he chose misrepresented the book, leaving me wondering if Herring has read it. Frank, an economist at Cornell, uses examples of the current luxury boom to win the reader to his economic view. What he proposes is a newer version of a system this country has spent nearly 100 years fighting: Communism. Our personal and economic freedoms allow me to make the choices I do, which often include dropping my teenage stepdaughter at her school in my sports utility truck. In the truck my family is safe and comfortable; that I drive my daughter door-to-door despite gridlock gives me a valuable 5 or 10 minutes more of precious time with her. Are safety, comfort and time with your children a luxury?</p>

        <p>I WAS disappointed by Hubert B. Herring's article ''Coping with Luxury Fever'' (June 25). His stilted view of current luxury trends offended me.</p>
        <p>I was disturbed to see that he used only a few select points from Robert Frank's book ''Luxury Fever'' to illustrate his ire. The quotes he chose misrepresented the book, leaving me wondering if Herring has read it. Frank, an economist at Cornell, uses examples of the current luxury boom to win the reader to his economic view. What he proposes is a newer version of a system this country has spent nearly 100 years fighting: Communism. Our personal and economic freedoms allow me to make the choices I do, which often include dropping my teenage stepdaughter at her school in my sports utility truck. In the truck my family is safe and comfortable; that I drive my daughter door-to-door despite gridlock gives me a valuable 5 or 10 minutes more of precious time with her. Are safety, comfort and time with your children a luxury?</p>
        <p>That the luxuries that Mr. Herring sees as selfish and destructive have become commonplace not only in Westchester but also in most areas of the country, demonstrates that our system works.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Herring missed the real point. He noted that Westchester ''is one of the nation's richest counties, so you would think that all that money could buy an awfully good way of life.'' I, too, thought that when I moved here two years ago. Unfortunately, it is not so. Despite a wealthy population, Westchester's retail is a cross between the Third World and relics from the 1950's. Its grocery stores rival those of Manhattan for their narrow aisles, bad lighting and out-of-date products on the shelves.  If shoppers want to go to Putnam County, where the income levels don't approach those of Westchester, the grocery stores are modern with gourmet sections rivaling Zabar's. Connecticut boasts dozens of fresh grocers, such as Hay Day and Fresh Fields, which specialize in fresh and organic produce and gourmet goods not available in most grocery chains.</p>
        <p>And food retailing is only the beginning. In recent years Westchester got its first Price Club, a concept that has become a suburban necessity that the rest of the country has had for 15 years or more. Also in recent years the county got its first Circuit City store; previously residents were forced to pay top dollar for less than top-of-the-line products at a limited number of stores.</p>
        <p>The county recently witnessed a huge battle to build a Stew Leonard's, Costco and Home Depot on a large rocky tract on the Thruway in Yonkers. At issue was the quality of life of Yonkers residents.</p>
        <p>What is more important to the quality of life: keeping traffic down (even though it brings with it more tax revenue and jobs) or fresh and competitively priced goods? If we don't keep our marketplaces competitive with new entrants and more choices, all of us -- rich and poor alike -- will be forced to pay ransom-like prices for basic necessities such as bread and milk.</p>
        <p>Westchester's retail community seems to operate as a complete contradiction to American economic philosophy that supposes that consumers rule the marketplace with the power of their dollar.</p>
        <p>In Westchester there often is no marketplace, so consumers drive to Connecticut or New Jersey to shop. I would welcome more development in my neighborhood, as would many of my neighbors. But with residents like Mr. Herring objecting to the simplest luxuries, such as driving our children to school, it is unlikely that Westchester retail will achieve 20th century standards for another few hundred years.</p>
