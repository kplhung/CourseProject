        <p>Former Newark Star-Ledger film critic Allen Barra letter on David Thomson's June 11 article praising films of Robert Altman recalls when Thomson mauled Altman in 1976 edition of A Biographical Dictionary of Film (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I'm thrilled that David Thomson has finally seen the light on Robert Altman's 1970's films. Some of us were beginning to wonder. It's certainly true that ''The Long Goodbye'' was ''mauled to bits by Raymond Chandler connoisseurs and critics alike'' in 1977, but what Mr. Thomson seems to forget is that he did his own share of Altman-mauling in the 1976 edition of his ''A Biographical Dictionary of Film.'' For instance, ''M*A*S*H'': ''for all its haunting reversal of war nightmare into daydream male companionship . . . a film deserted by its director in its last third.'' And ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'': ''Altman's most conventional film . . . reveals Altman is a pessimist.'' And ''The Long Goodbye'': ''points at the director's rather bewildered disenchantment with the world, but seems content to pass it off as a style rather than an attitude.'' It's a relief to know that while some of these films sat moldering in cans, they somehow metamorphosed into what Mr. Thomson now calls ''unequivocally great works.''</p>

        <p>Another thing Mr. Thomson neglects to point out is that all critics in the 70's were not mauling Altman; Pauline Kael championed all of the above-mentioned films.</p>
