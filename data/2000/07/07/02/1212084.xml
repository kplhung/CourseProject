        <p>Me And Hank</p>
        <p>A Boy and His Hero,</p>
        <p>Twenty-Five Years Later.</p>
        <p>By Sandy Tolan.</p>
        <p>The Free Press, $24.</p>
        <p>In his tribute to Henry Aaron, Sandy Tolan delivers a solid hit. Tolan has decided to make an exploration of American racism as central to his memoir, ''Me and Hank,'' as his appreciation of the American pastime. Born and raised in Milwaukee, Tolan grew up watching Aaron lead a Braves team that won the World Series in 1957 but moved to Atlanta after the 1965 season. A loyal fan nonetheless, Tolan cheered Aaron on as, season by season, he closed in on baseball's most famous achievement: Babe Ruth's career total of 714 home runs. But the nearer Aaron came, the more hate mail he received -- menacing letters threatening to kill him should he, a black man, dare to supersede Ruth. Shocked and angered by such prejudice, the young Tolan wrote his hero a letter of support, and Aaron wrote back, thanking him for his concern. Twenty-five years later, Tolan remains perplexed that despite Aaron's formidable statistics, he is still underappreciated. Tolan, who is white, explores just how much race still matters in baseball and in the United States as he interviews, among others, Aaron and his wife and daughter; civil rights leaders, including Jesse Jackson and Andrew Young; old friends, black and white, with whom Tolan went to school; baseball players, coaches and executives like Bud Selig and Dusty Baker; and a black homeless man whom Tolan befriends. At times, Tolan can ramble too far afield, but his probing portrait reminds us that while thousands cheered, others fumed. And the cumulative impact of Tolan's documentary-like approach leaves no doubt of the true nature of Aaron's achievement, on the field and off.</p>
