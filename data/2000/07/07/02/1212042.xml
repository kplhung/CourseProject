        <p>YEARS ago, cartoons were modeled on real people and animals - or at least on sitcom versions of them, the way ''The Flinstones'' were based on ''The Honeymooners.'' Today cartoons and reality are virtually interchangeable, with films like ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' and this summer's ''Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' featuring marquee actors alongside cartoon critters, and ''The Flinstones in Viva Rock Vegas,'' starring Mark Addy as a flesh-and-blood Fred. Now that ''the circle is completed,'' as they say in the cartoon-turned-Broadway-show ''The Lion King,'' it may be a good time to test your knowledge of how it began.</p>

        <p>YEARS ago, cartoons were modeled on real people and animals - or at least on sitcom versions of them, the way ''The Flinstones'' were based on ''The Honeymooners.'' Today cartoons and reality are virtually interchangeable, with films like ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' and this summer's ''Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' featuring marquee actors alongside cartoon critters, and ''The Flinstones in Viva Rock Vegas,'' starring Mark Addy as a flesh-and-blood Fred. Now that ''the circle is completed,'' as they say in the cartoon-turned-Broadway-show ''The Lion King,'' it may be a good time to test your knowledge of how it began.</p>
        <p>1. ''Scobby-Doo,'' starring a ghost-busting, stubble-chinned mutt, was one of the most popular and widely imitated cartoons of the 70's. What radio disc jockey provided the voice of Scooby's human sidekick, Shaggy?</p>
        <p>2. The animator Chuck Jones imposed rigorous strictures on his minimalist ''Road Runner'' series: the setting is always in the desert, the road runner never leaves the road, the road runner never hurts the coyote, the audience sympathizes with the coyote, and there is no dialogue. Other than an occasional ''beep beep,'' did the characters ever speak?</p>
        <p>3. What nugget of television history did ''The Flinestones'' claim when it first went on their air in 1960?</p>
        <p>4. With his purple porkpie hat and hipster pals like Benny the Ball, Top Cat was definitely the coolest dude in town. To which humor-in-uniform sitcom did the cartoon bear more than a passing resemblance?</p>
        <p>5. Holy crossovers, Batman! ''The New Batman/Superman Adventures'' was truer to the gothic feel of the original comic book than the campy 1960's live action series ''Batman.'' Name the actor who guest-starred as a villain in both the live ''Batman'' and the cartoon.</p>
        <p>6. Rocket J. Squirrel from Frostbite Falls, Minn., and Bullwinkle J. Moose, the ardent alumnus of Wossamotto U., are the best-known creations of the talented animator Jay Ward. The Ward Studios also produced what long-lived animated character for a breakfast cereal?</p>
        <p>7. The bratty Bart Simpson restored animation to prime time. On what live show did ''The Simpsons'' originate as a series of animated vignettes? Extra points: What is the name of the ultraviolent cartoon series within a series beloved by Bart?</p>
        <p>ANSWERS</p>
        <p>1. Casey kasem, best known as the host of radio's ''American Top 40.''</p>
        <p>2. A trick question: Wile E. Coyote appeared in a series of Bugs Bunny cartoons and spoke in an insinuating mad-scientist voice.</p>
        <p>3. ''The Flintstones'' was the first animated series to appear in a prime-time slot., Fridays at 8:30 p.m. on ABC. Fred Flintstone didn't always sell kid stuff like chewable vitamins and fruity cereal; one of the show's original sponsors was Winston cigarettes.</p>
        <p>4. ''Top Cat'' transformed the lovable layabouts of the military motor pool in ''The Phil Silvers Show'' into alley cats. T.C., as he is known to his intellectual close friends, took the Sergeant Bilko role as the swindling leader. The gang's nemesis was Officer Dibble rather than Colonel Hall. The rotund character actor Maurice Gosfield, who played the inept Pvt. Duane Doberman on the series, provided the voice for Benny the Ball.</p>
        <p>5. Roddy McDowall played the Bookworm on the show and provided the voice of the Mad Hatter in the cartoon.</p>
        <p>6. Cap'n Crunch, which was introduced nationally in 1963.</p>
        <p>7. Bart and his family got their start on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' in 1987. ''The Itchy and Scratchy Show'' within ''The Simpsons'' is a Swiftian satire of the cat-and-mouse mayhem of ''Tom and Jerry.''  SPOTLIGHT</p>
