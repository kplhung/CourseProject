        <p>Disney World is not closing down for a private party this weekend. And 20,000 people will not line the airport terminal to cheer the superstars' arrivals. But everything else about Tim Duncan's and Grant Hill's trips to Orlando, Fla., runs toward the extravagant and lavish.</p>
        <p>The free-agent negotiating period began at 12:01 a.m. yesterday, and it was highlighted by an all-expenses-paid trip to the Magic Kingdom by the well-funded and desperate Orlando Magic franchise still seeking replacements for Shaq and Penny.</p>
        <p>For at least three days Duncan and Hill are essentially on a luxurious recruiting visit that they could have never imagined at Wake Forest or Duke, respectively. There will be jumbo-shrimp receptions, seven-course meals and most likely golf with  Magic Coach Doc Rivers. They will no doubt tour the exclusive Islenorth residential community where Tiger Woods, Ken Griffey Jr. and Shaquille O'Neal own palaces.</p>
        <p>The Magic's race to dump salaries last week gave the club more than $20 million to spend on the game's top free agents. Orlando could now afford to pay two maximum-level contracts and add another decent free agent.</p>
        <p>Duncan and Hill do not seem to be players who respond to glitz and gaudiness. Duncan is said to be leaning toward re-signing with the San Antonio Spurs. If Hill does not leave the Detroit Pistons, he could join Duncan at least on paper, signing for the exception and waiting for the Spurs to clear salary-cap room the following season so they could sign him to a maximum contract.</p>
        <p>But you never know. To entice Horace Grant to leave the Chicago Bulls in the mid-1990's, the Magic used Disney World to shoot fireworks with Grant's name into the Orlando sky.</p>
        <p>The Magic staff wore Grant-like goggles in the office, and O'Neal chauffeured Grant around town. There is talk the Magic may go as far as Duncan's hometown, St. Croix, in the Virgin Islands, to court the All-Star forward.</p>
        <p>Most teams are peeved about the visits, charging Orlando with violating the no-contact rule before yesterday. Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, wondered last week, ''How did they arrange the trip?''</p>
        <p>One Eastern Conference coach, requesting anonymity, said, ''We're all hoping it's unseasonably hot, humid and muggy down there, with a few thunderstorms spliced in.''</p>
        <p>Tracy McGrady, Eddie Jones and Tim Thomas are most likely hoping for the same. If Hill and Duncan commit to the Magic on Aug. 1 -- the day teams can actually sign contracts with free agents, as if they have not got the deal in place already -- the leverage of some of the other top free agents disappears.</p>
        <p>Chicago has $19 million to sign free agents, but Krause appears to be more realistic about his chances of landing the biggest free-agent fish. Quite possibly, Orlando may have to resort to a backup plan that involves acquiring McGrady, perhaps Thomas and pulling off a deal for Portland's Jermaine O'Neal.</p>
        <p>Here are the possibilities over the next month:</p>
        <p>TRACY McGRADY -- He wants to go to Orlando more than anyone else, but the Bulls may be the favorite if the Raptors cannot pull off a sign-and-trade deal.</p>
        <p>TIM THOMAS -- Milwaukee wants to keep him, but if the Bulls and Magic cannot pry Duncan or Hill loose, his asking price may be too much for the Bucks.</p>
        <p>EDDIE JONES -- He has his heart set on Miami, but base-year contract status prevents the Hornets from receiving equal value. Unless he is traded, Charlotte may be where he stays.</p>
        <p>TONI KUKOC -- The 76ers barely got to see what he could do after trading for him at midseason, so rather than take a gamble on an aging Glen Rice in a trade with the Lakers, they may decide to start running the offense through him more and open up the passing lanes.</p>
        <p>GLEN RICE -- His star has fallen, to the point that he simply cannot secure the maximum deal. But a desperate free agent is a dangerous one, and it would not be a complete shock if he remained in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>RASHARD LEWIS -- Seattle wants to keep him, but the Bulls' Krause may overpay him if other options fail. Maybe the most unheralded free agent, Lewis could turn out to be an All-Star in two seasons.</p>
        <p>BRIAN GRANT -- The Lakers are not going to get him. He will probably secure more money from his own team after opting out of a $41 million deal. If not, don't rule the Knicks out in some kind of creative sign-and-trade deal. That is, if the Blazers president Bob Whitsitt will still deal with New York after the Chris Dudley contract fiasco three years ago.</p>
        <p>MAURICE TAYLOR -- The Knicks made a play for him at the All-Star Game break, but he will most likely end up with a needier team like the Bulls or the Magic.</p>
        <p>JOE SMITH -- The Timberwolves want him back, and he does not have a lot of leverage to go elsewhere.</p>
        <p>KURT THOMAS -- Nice role player who could be a lot of teams' backup free agent if the Knicks do not re-sign him for what he wants.</p>
        <p>JALEN ROSE -- The Pistons are praying, but Rose got off his need-to-play-point-guard kick during the playoffs. He likes where he is.</p>
        <p>REGGIE MILLER and MARK JACKSON -- Like Stockton and Malone, they believe they have one more run left.</p>
        <p>TIM HARDAWAY -- Health reasons aside, how can Pat Riley lose one of the game's premier clutch players? He can't.</p>
        <p>DEREK ANDERSON and RON MERCER -- Both players do not have the pedigree of the others, but they will probably wind up being moved in sign-and-trade deals at bargain rates.</p>
        <p>JOHN STARKS -- Yes, he would still like to come back to New York if the Knicks will find it in their hearts to reacquire him (a slim possibility, one team official said). And, yes, he will also take a paycheck from Riley, if necessary.</p>
        <p>''I've got to keep my options open at this point,'' Starks said by cell phone Friday as he was watching his 13-year-old son play at a Memphis basketball camp. ''This probably being my last contract and all, I can't limit the possibilities.''</p>
        <p>Starks said he recently spoke with Patrick Ewing but did not get any indication of what Ewing would do. With a year remaining on his deal, Ewing is expected to ask the Knicks for an extension or request his release.</p>
        <p>''It was tough for him,'' Starks said, ''coming back from the injury and playing as well as he did at times, and then to have to deal with all the negativity. But that's New York. He knows that.''</p>
        <p>The Value of Williams</p>
        <p>Jayson Williams's retirement because of a career-ending leg injury had been rumored for months. When it happened last week, so many other stories encircled the Nets that it basically put Williams on the back shelf. With the draft, the hiring of Byron Scott and other league business, the N.B.A. hardly blinked an eye.</p>
        <p>It's too bad, because the league lost one of the best blueprints for its young players.</p>
        <p>Williams was the self-proclaimed ''knucklehead'' who turned his career around and became an All-Star. If you throw out the entertainment factor -- Williams was as funny as Charles Barkley and not as mean-spirited -- you essentially have a person who gave up the surreal party life of the league in his late 20's and started to understand the importance of winning and playing together.</p>
        <p>Dennis Rodman was hailed as the greatest rebounder of the last decade, but Williams hunted down loose balls with the same or more urgency and desire. Yes, he chipped a lot of paint off the rim with his jump shot and was a bit undersized to stop the game's elite centers. But he never stopped working and going hard at his opponent.</p>
        <p>Charitable beyond many of his peers, Williams was also one of the best people in the N.B.A. Here's hoping he gets an analyst's job soon, so he can finally get paid for making fun of his teammates.</p>
        <p>A Pacers' Timeout</p>
        <p>It is supposed to be a fait accompli, Isiah Thomas taking over the Indiana Pacers' coaching duties. But the team's president, Donnie Walsh, is not so sure. Tired of the news media leaks and campaigning going on between Thomas and Rick Carlisle, a Pacers assistant, Walsh was taking the weekend to re-evaluate the situation.</p>
        <p>''I want to step away from this for a day or two,'' Walsh said. ''I want to see if these are the right two guys. I'm not going to say I'm not going to hire one of them. I'm just saying it's time to step away.''</p>
        <p>Walsh has not interviewed anyone else. But if Thomas is not named soon -- he is still in negotiations to sell the Continental Basketball Association to the players union -- it will not be surprising if the Pacers turn elsewhere. Beyond obvious candidates like Mike Fratello, Del Harris could find himself in the mix. Harris, who grew up in Indiana, interviewed with Walsh before he took over the Lakers job. The two have a good relationship.</p>
        <p>Walsh would not comment on other coaching candidates, but down deep he is starting to wonder: if this is how they perform going after a job, how will they perform when the first team crisis hits the Pacers?</p>
