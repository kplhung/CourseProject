        <p>He has just received a vote of confidence from the United States in the form of $1.3 billion in emergency military aid. But as President Andres Pastrana nears the midpoint of his term, his standing is sinking, and even his supporters fear that his position will continue to deteriorate.</p>
        <p>Vowing to end decades of guerrilla war, Mr. Pastrana took office in August 1998 with the highest vote total of any candidate in Colombian history. But he has been steadily hurt by a lack of progress in peace talks with the Marxist rebels, economic recession, a crippling feud with Congress and now accusations of corruption.</p>
        <p>The result is what Semana, the country's leading news magazine, has called ''a crisis of governability without precedent.'' A recent cover showed two rebel leaders with big grins and warned that ''while the establishment wears itself out in futile clashes, the country is collapsing and the guerrillas gain ground.''</p>
        <p>The United States Congress's approval of an emergency antidrug aid package this week appears to afford Mr. Pastrana only marginal respite. The plan will do nothing to eliminate the sparring with his own Congress or the complaints of corruption. Nor will it help to end the recession, as the bulk of the aid will go to the military, not into the economy.</p>
        <p>For economic relief, Mr. Pastrana has been counting on the other side of what his government calls ''Plan Colombia,'' nearly $2 billion in aid from European and other donors due to meet Colombian officials in Madrid in coming days. But Mr. Pastrana continues to face skepticism about his carrot-and-stick approach with the rebels and the American military aid has added to those anxieties.</p>
        <p>''Nobody wants Pastrana to come home empty handed, and every effort will be made to prevent that from happening,'' said a European diplomat here. ''But there is a feeling that this is a primarily military plan and that we are being asked to clean up the mess that the Americans are going to make.''</p>
        <p>Popular support for the peace effort is now ''precarious,'' Jorge Humberto Botero, head of the country's bank association, cautioned earlier this month. ''The country is sickened by blood,'' he said. ''It is intimidated and terrorized.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Botero's warning came after the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the main insurgent group, announced a plan to tax all wealthy Colombians and kidnap those who refuse to pay. Since the rebels are already taxing businesses and carrying out summary executions in the sizable demilitarized zone Mr. Pastrana handed to them in late 1998, the new demand has added to the impression they see themselves as a parallel government.</p>
        <p>''How much longer is our government going to keep treating these subversive criminals with such deference?'' asked Jose Manuel Tovar Jimenez, an accountant. ''I'm sick of constantly making concessions to them and getting nothing in return but new and more outrageous demands.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pastrana's political problems mounted this spring when he called for a referendum that would shut down the Congress, widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, and replace it with a more streamlined and accountable body. Legislators counterattacked, saying that Mr. Pastrana's own job should also be put to a vote, and the president was eventually forced to withdraw his proposal.</p>
        <p>''Pastrana is in dire straits as a result,'' a diplomat here said. ''No matter how things turn out, he has poisoned relations with Congress for the remainder of his term.''</p>
        <p>Charges of corruption in Mr. Pastrana's administration have also emerged, fed by the opposition Liberal Party, whose own image was permanently tarnished by evidence that drug traffickers contributed to its 1994 presidential campaign. Suspect donations to the Pastrana campaign from a dredging company have been the focal point of the allegations, with members of Mr. Pastrana's cabinet and staff said to have been involved.</p>
        <p>''With the certainty that nothing will be found, I'm not going to slow down to dedicate further time or space to such infamies,'' Mr. Pastrana complained in a recent speech.</p>
        <p>None of the accusations have been proved. But the simple perception of irregularities has weakened the ''white knight'' image that has been about the only trump card remaining in Mr. Pastrana's deck.</p>
        <p>''I wanted a change, and what we are getting is the same old way of doing things at the time we can least afford it,'' said Mercedes Ardila Ochoa, a secretary</p>
        <p>Mr. Pastrana's declining popularity is also part of a broader institutional breakdown in Colombian politics. As in neighboring Venezuela and Peru, the population here is growing increasingly disgusted with the traditional party system, in which power alternates between Liberals and Conservatives.</p>
        <p>''The people perceive the parties as not representing their interests,'' said Myles Frechette, who was the United States ambassador here in the late 1990's. ''And they are just not doing what the people need. They equate the political class with corruption, and they see a lot of cheap populist talk but nobody really doing anything.''</p>
        <p>For now, with any progress in fighting either the war or the recession seemingly a long way off, Mr. Pastrana is trying to reverse his sagging political fortunes by making over his image, which a diplomat here described as ''slick and cold.''</p>
        <p>Dressed casually in a sweater and open-necked shirt and speaking in an unusually colloquial manner, Mr. Pastrana went on television June 21 to urge Colombians to ''adopt a new attitude'' and be more optimistic.</p>
        <p>''I'm tired of pessimism always winning out over hope,'' he said, ''of negativism over the positive, of the bad over the good, the individual over the collective.''</p>
        <p>Afterward, the country's leading newspaper, El Tiempo, said that even though ''the new Andres'' might seem ''frivolous or irrelevant,'' it was best to withhold judgment. ''The success or failure of the strategy,'' it noted, ''is tied to concrete actions of the government,'' and those have yet to be seen.</p>
