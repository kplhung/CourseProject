        <p>Dr. Ann Virginia Arthur, a pediatric ophthalmologist, and Patrick Curtis Andrew, an ironworker, were married yesterday in Brookville, N.Y., at the home of her brother Floyd Arthur and sister-in-law Lydia Andrew, the bridegroom's cousin. Justice Harold Silverman of State Supreme Court in the Bronx officiated.</p>
        <p>The bride owns Park Slope Eye Care Associates in Brooklyn. She graduated from Brown University and from the Yale University School of Medicine. She is a daughter of Rosalind Arthur of Brooklyn and the late Vernon Arthur.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom works on skyscrapers as a member of Ironworkers Local 424 in New Haven. He is a son of Faithina and Daniel Andrew of Carriacou, Grenada.</p>
        <p>The couple met two years ago when they were introduced by Lydia Andrew at a benefit dinner for the Health Committee for Carriacou and Petit Martinique.</p>
        <p>''He's 6 foot 6 and very striking, and I like tall men,'' Dr. Arthur recalled. ''But he wasn't being attentive to me. I was thinking, I'm going to make this guy talk to me.'' Eventually, she started a conversation about the Super Bowl, but he still didn't seem very interested. ''So at the end of the evening,'' she remembered, ''I took out my business card and said, 'If you are ever in Brooklyn, give me a call.' ''</p>
        <p>He did eventually call her, and on their first date, he really won her heart by installing a phone jack in her Brooklyn apartment. Soon, he was traveling down to visit her every week from his home in New Haven.</p>
        <p>After many long conversations, the couple decided, without fanfare, to marry. ''It wasn't very romantic,'' she said. ''I mean, he's 44, I'm 36. No one's going to put a ring under a cup for me.'' She added that she admires his courage, and not only because he walks the high steel. ''He's been married before and had a bad experience,'' she said. ''But he's not afraid to try again.''</p>
