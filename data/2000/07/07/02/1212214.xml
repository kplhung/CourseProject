        <p>THIS is a story about a small boy (me) who dredged a mysterious treasure from the Bronx River some years ago, and, as he gradually discovered what it was and how it came there, heard the river speak.</p>
        <p>The story begins when the boy was 10, growing up in Bronxville. His life back then revolved around the Bronx River -- that sluggish stream which bisects lower Westchester County before it blows a watery kiss to Manhattan and ripples into the East River near Hunts Point.</p>
        <p>In those days, the boy and his friends -- they could have passed for Huck and Tom -- were frequently down by the river, barefoot, with pants legs rolled up and bamboo fishing poles in hand. They cruised the river and fought mock naval battles on homemade rafts. They caught sunfish and catfish, turtles of several varieties and sharp-toothed crayfish.</p>
        <p>The small boy's biggest catch was the smooth, round object he happened to step on when wading in the river. It was about two feet deep right there, and so he couldn't see what lay below. Inquisitively, he wriggled his foot against the thing. It seemed about the size of a bowling ball, half buried in the sandy bottom.</p>
        <p>Within minutes, he was rolling it to shore. By then, he had no doubt what it was. He'd seen pyramids of these bleakly glowering things at war memorial monuments. Unlike some, this cannonball was hollow and with a fuse hole almost two inches in diameter.</p>
        <p>Even when drained of water and mud, it was too heavy to lift. It took the small boy better than an hour to roll it to his house a mile away.</p>
        <p>Once it was installed in a corner of his bedroom, and the small boy was tucked under his covers, scenes of derring-do danced in his head.</p>
        <p>The boy had learned in a social studies class that the Revolutionary War had chewed its way through Westchester in the fall of 1776, and so he imagined that the cannonball had figured in that conflict. But then he recalled that the nearest scene of fighting was the Battle of White Plains -- about eight miles north of where he'd found the cannonball.</p>
        <p>How could it have traveled so far? he wondered.</p>
        <p>The boy dreamed up an answer. Since he had found the cannonball at the foot of a cliff almost 80 feet high, he guessed that as Washington's men trudged along the river bank from New York City to White Plains, the cannonball had accidentally rolled off an ammunition cart, plunged over the cliff and disappeared in the river.</p>
        <p>That explanation satisfied the boy for several years until, as a young adult, he tried to write a school paper on the subject. He consulted the classic ''Battles of the American Revolution,'' published in 1877 by Henry B. Carrington, a professor of military science at Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Ind.</p>
        <p>Carrington's book was especially useful because it reproduced historical documents and included vintage topographical battle maps, including a map of the Battle of White Plains.</p>
        <p>Carrington told how General Washington, in full retreat from Harlem Heights, set a lethal trap for Sir William Howe, George III's commander in America, who was in hot pursuit.</p>
        <p>Washington reached White Plains first and fortified the nearby Chatterton Hill. He then lured Howe to the river's edge. Howe let loose with an artillery barrage -- mainly ineffective -- and then drove his men to ford the river and struggle up the hill while being showered with musketry and artillery.</p>
        <p>The redcoats lost 230 killed or wounded that day.</p>
        <p>That was almost twice the number lost by the Colonists, according to Carrington.</p>
        <p>It was one of the first clashes to demonstrate that the Colonial Army was led by a general well versed in strategy.</p>
        <p>At first, Carrington's chapter on White Plains seemed to confirm the young man's theory about the cannonball, but soon it compelled him to reconsider.</p>
        <p>Whereas Carrington wrote that Washington had marched ''along the west bank of the Bronx,'' the cannonball had been discovered on the east side of the river.</p>
        <p>Well, then, the young man thought, perhaps the cannonball was British and toppled off a British ammunition cart on the east side of the river.</p>
        <p>But Carrington foreclosed that possibility, too. Howe's forces, he wrote, pursued Washington on a course ''parallel with the River Bronx'' but never within several miles of it until they approached White Plains.</p>
        <p>The young man tore up the paper he was writing.</p>
        <p>As the young man grew older, the cannonball cropped up in his thoughts from time to time.</p>
        <p>In 1981, it occurred to him that the iron ball itself might harbor the secret of its origin, so he sent photographs to the director of the West Point Museum, seeking help.</p>
        <p>The response was prompt. The cannonball is a 10-inch mortar projectile and ''probably dates to the period of the American Civil War,'' came the reply.</p>
        <p>The distinguishing characteristics of a Revolutionary War cannonball, the director explained, were the ''ears'' that stood out on either side of the fuse hole. These extensions were helpful in gripping the cannonball and lifting it into the bore of the gun.</p>
        <p>In contrast to ears, the young man's cannonball had indentations so that it could be grasped and lifted with pointed tongs.</p>
        <p>Discouraged by this news, the young man dropped the matter a second time.</p>
        <p>Years went by until he (now the father of three) happened to take his family to the Gettysburg battlefield in Pennsylvania. The weapons on display reminded him of the old cannonball. And so, just a few weeks ago, he called Harry Hunter, curator for ordnance at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.</p>
        <p>''Sure, it could be from the Revolution!'' Mr. Hunter sang out in answer to the query. ''They used both types -- with ears and without ears. They weren't so particular back then.''</p>
        <p>And then, at last, the river spoke -- through Rhodes Fairbridge, a Columbia University emeritus professor of geology.</p>
        <p>''Yes, definitely,'' Professor Fairbridge told his interviwer (whose hair has now turned gray).</p>
        <p>''A cannonball could be moved eight miles by the action of the river in the course of two centuries. The way the current works is that it scours sand or mud at the downstream edge of the object and causes it to roll. It's like a surfboard rider as he skims a wave. He's always on a slope. Quite large boulders are rolled in this way, even when the river descends at a relatively low angle.''</p>
        <p>As good as those explanations were, they may not be the end of it. These mysteries lie uneasily in their graves.</p>
        <p>Yet what seems plausible at present is that when Howe bombarded Chatterton Hill, one earless round fell short and went hissing in the river.</p>
        <p>Then, as the years went by, the cannonball waddled down the river's course to where the small boy found it. No, it had not been carelessly discarded. No, indeed. It had been dragged to the battlefront and grimly fired at the Colonists. But the river put its fire out. And so, Washington and his men escaped its wrath and lived to carry on at Trenton and Yorktown.</p>
        <p>And thus, the river told its tale.</p>
        <p>Other Vestiges of the Battle of White Plains</p>
        <p>IT wasn't a stroke of military genius like the victory at Trenton, nor as decisive as the Battle of Yorktown, but Washington out-led his British opponent at the Battle of White Plains in October 1776.</p>
        <p>Washington's strategy included fortifying a hilltop near White Plains, and then tempting Sir William Howe to drive his redcoat army across a river, and then up the hill while Washington's men rained musketry and artillery on them.</p>
        <p>The redcoats took the hill, but only after suffering almost twice the number of casualties as the Colonists. When the smoke of battle cleared, it was evident that the Colonists' rag-tag army was a far more effective fighting force than the British had supposed.</p>
        <p>Vestiges of the battle may still be seen where it was fought.</p>
