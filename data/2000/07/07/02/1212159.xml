        <p>Randy Cohen The Ethicist question-and-answer column on ethics of Lutheran pastor voting for school building project that would be funded by increased property taxes when pastor's parsonage is exempt from taxes; on whether offering trash collector money to remove excess garbage is a bribe; on whether taking unused, wrapped soaps and shampoos from motels to give to homeless is considered stealing (M)</p>

        <p>I am a Lutheran pastor living in a parsonage. Our school district is debating a building project to be funded by increased property taxes, a proposition I support (although I do not have any children enrolled in the system). As the parsonage is exempt from property tax, is it right for me to vote in the election, considering that should the project be approved, my portion of its taxation is passed on to neighbors? -- Douglas S. Larson-Sell, Lonsdale, Minn.</p>
        <p>Your exemption from property taxes is not germane. Many people own no property and hence pay no property taxes; they still get to vote. The United States long ago abandoned owning land as a prerequisite for voting. (And I understand that in many states women have been granted the franchise.)</p>

        <p>I am a Lutheran pastor living in a parsonage. Our school district is debating a building project to be funded by increased property taxes, a proposition I support (although I do not have any children enrolled in the system).

Larson-Sell, Lonsdale, Minn.</p>
        <p>Your exemption from property taxes is not germane. Many people own no property and hence pay no property taxes; they still get to vote. The United States long ago abandoned owning land as a prerequisite for voting. (And I understand that in many states women have been granted the franchise.)</p>
        <p>As a citizen, you should vote on all ballot issues, even those that don't seem to affect you directly. Otherwise, only motorists would vote on highway bills, only backpackers (or bears) on funds for national parks. But these issues concern the entire society. For instance, the bill you describe finances school construction, and even those without children have a stake in an educated populace. Democracy works best when civic life is strong, when people have a broad sense of community, shared experiences and mutual responsibility.</p>
        <p>Although I must say, why church property like your house is exempt from taxes is a mystery to me.</p>
        <p>My city will haul away only trash inside the bins. When a garden project left more trimmings than fit into the bin, my neighbor suggested I offer the trash collector $10 or $20 to take the excess. Isn't this as bad as offering a policeman money to avoid a ticket? Where do you draw the line between outright bribery and a little ''lubrication,'' like slipping the matre d' 10 bucks for a better table? -- R.T., Los Angeles</p>
        <p>Here's one place to draw the line: when you pay someone to break the law, as you contemplate here, it's a bribe.</p>
        <p>One reason some people dislike tipping is because of the ambiguity you describe. Are you showing appreciation for a job well done or inducing someone to do something he otherwise would not? That is, are you rewarding the maitre d' for attentive service or enticing him to give you a table deserved by someone else?</p>
        <p>There is something to be said for clear responsibilities, decent paychecks and hauling your own excess weeds to the dump. Alternatively, you could simply stash your trash out back until next week's pickup when there's room in the bin.</p>
        <p>As subtle as the distinction between a bribe and a tip can be, it is lucidity itself compared to this murky imponderable: what is the difference between a bribe and a campaign contribution -- particularly when an interest group donates to both candidates in a race? Science is baffled.</p>
        <p>When we stay at motels, I bring the unused, wrapped soaps and shampoos home to be passed on to a shelter for the homeless. My husband maintains I'm stealing. I consider the cost of these items to be built into the charge for the room and that they are ours to do with what we wish. What is your opinion? -- R.S., Schenectady, N.Y.</p>
        <p>What you're doing isn't exactly stealing, but it is taking advantage. While you're at the motel, you may wash yourself as lavishly as you like, but you may not back a truck up to the supply room or, for that matter, empty out the shelf above the sink. That the motel budgets for such things is neither here nor there; they budget for fire insurance, but you really ought not torch the place. If you want to donate to a homeless shelter, do so out of your pocket, not someone else's.</p>
