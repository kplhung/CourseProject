        <p>THE Opera Festival of New Jersey season is well under way, but concertgoers can still take in all four operas, although they will have to step lively to catch the first two. It is a rewarding exercise to follow the summer's musical progression from the popular ''Carmen'' through ''Falstaff''-- Verdi's last opera -- to Hugo Weisgall's intriguing ''Six Characters in Search of an Author,'' and finally, the brand new ''Burning Bright,'' by Frank Lewin, a Princeton native.</p>
        <p>By moving to McCarter Theater three summers ago, the 17-year-old company acquired the use of an orchestra pit, a computer-based box office, and a location that helped boost subscription sales. This summer is its first with four productions, all with supertitles. Recognizing its steady growth, Money magazine listed it along with international names like Glyndebourne and Salzburg, as one of the world's top warm-weather troupes.</p>
        <p>''Carmen,'' with Suzanna Guzman in the title role, has two more performances, as does ''Falstaff,'' which stars Mark Delavan, a Morristown resident and onetime student at Newark's Opera Music Theater Institute, who has sung the title role at New York City Opera.</p>
        <p>The jolly performance of ''Falstaff,'' which opened last Saturday, was staged and directed (by Michael McConnell) with wit, and -- considering its jokes about drunkenness, lechery, stupidity and obesity -- surprisingly good taste.</p>
        <p>Almost no one at last week's pre-performance talk had seen the opera, though more knew of the Shakespeare character and ''The Merry Wives of Windsor.'' There's a reason for the unfamiliarity: despite many beautiful moments (most in the sweet young love duets of Nannetta and Fenton) ''Falstaff'' is on no one's Top 10 list. Verdi was an old master in 1893, more interested in plot, musical form and Boccaccio-like ribaldry than in arias showcasing superb sopranos or tenors in sumptuous costumes.</p>
        <p>''Falstaff'' is a tricky ensemble piece, with sextets and octets sung not by Verdi's usual noblemen and tragic heroines but by rowdy groups of merry wives and lowbrow guys.  It's a conductor's nightmare, which Willie Anthony Waters, director of Connecticut Opera, kept together with spirit. If the orchestra was sometimes overloud, supertitles compensated.</p>
        <p>The busy action, with its plotting and whispers, disguises and rudeness, plus sight gags with laundry, suits the agile young cast and medium theater space. Mr. Delavan's Falstaff, whose belly will doubtless stay put in future performances, rightly dominated the stage in personality and vocalism, and was quite magnificent dressed up for ill-fated trysts. The assured others from City Opera, including Victor Benedetti, Juliana Rambaldi, Jonathan Boyd and Kristen Plumley, hung in there -- a few literally, climbing around a central oak tree.</p>
        <p>Friday's opening of Hugo Weisgall's sophisticated setting of Pirandello's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author'' is directed by Albert Takazauckas and is to be conducted by Barbara Day Turner, artistic director of the San Jose Opera. Its surreal plot turns on a production director's conflict about balancing the artistic needs of his actors and those of mysterious, peculiar ''Characters'' with their own stories to tell.  Whether the music enhances the text, is a matter of opinion, and opinions cover a large spectrum.</p>
        <p>Opera Festival continues to attract singers from the Metropolitan and New City Opera: besides large number in ''Falstaff,'' the cast of ''Six Characters'' includes the baritone Robert Orth and the mezzo-soprano Rosalind Elias.</p>
        <p>Because ''Burning Bright'' is new, it should have the biggest buzz. Mr. Lewin set the Steinbeck novella in 1993, and this production is its professional premiere. Steinbeck wrote it in 1950, after his years of prime quality writing. Mr. Lewin has been on the faculties of Columbia and Yale, but is identified with his television and film scores, especially ''The Defenders'' on television.</p>
        <p>In the conversationally tonal, fluid American idiom of Carlisle Floyd and Douglas Moore, ''Burning Bright'' spins, as they do, a sinister folk yarn. Steinbeck had a folksy style too, but raised the material to tragedy in ''Of Mice and Men'' and ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' of which this is palely reminiscent. The four characters and story line are continuous, but the backdrop changes. In the first act they are circus performers, with wonderful circus music, in the second, farmers, and in the third, shipmates on a freighter.</p>
        <p>Mordeen, who out of love for her sterile husband, Joe Saul, conceives a child with his young fellow worker and tries to persuade Joe Saul to accept it as his own. He does so in an assenting aria at the end, saying ''that every man is father to all children and every child must have all men as father.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewin had an easy job leaving Steinbeck's words intact. The author imagined his work as a student play, so the dialogue is slightly elevated in manner, with important thoughts repeated in different phrases. A librettist was not necessary.</p>
        <p>Patrick Hanson, Opera Festival's music director, leads the performance. The conductor on the unpublished recording, however, is the Haddonfield Symphony's new director, Rossen Milanov, who has also been appointed assistant conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra.</p>
        <p>Most performances are preceded by informal talks by the university's associate dean of the faculty, Katherine T. Rohrer, who clearly loves the music.</p>
