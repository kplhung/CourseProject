        <p>THE sign on the door is clear. On weekends, Haagen-Dazs closes at 11 p.m.</p>
        <p>But don't tell that to the four little girls holding waffle cones with sprinkles, swinging their legs as they sit outside in the balmy night air. Or to the woman in the NYPD Emergency Service uniform who illegally parks her truck out front to run in for a shake. Or to the college kids who stop short when they see the long line of people crushed into the little store.</p>
        <p>''Oh my God,'' one young man said. ''We're not the only ones with this idea.''</p>
        <p>Late on steamy nights, Brooklyn Heights residents converge on this little ice cream shop at 120 Montague Street. The interior, with its creamy vanilla walls and berry-colored piping, offers air-conditioned relief. But the real attractions are the dulce de leche shakes, the Bailey's Irish Cream sippers and the traditional sugar cones whose allure trumps any human timetable.</p>
        <p>On a recent Saturday, attempts to spot the last customer of the night were fruitless.</p>
        <p>''We're open as late as people want us to be,'' said Joseph Megre, who owns the franchise. ''None of the other Haagen-Dazses stay open so late, none of them.''</p>
        <p>The store has another claim to fame.  ''This is where Haagen-Dazs started,'' Mr. Megre said of the store, which was opened in 1972 by a Polish immigrant named Reuben Mattus. The store's Scandinavian-sounding name, Mr. Megre said, ''means nothing.''</p>
        <p>''A European name sounds very attractive for Americans, that's why.''</p>
        <p>Customers line up for ice cream on most summer nights, but Mr. Megre said the busiest night of the year is on the Fourth of July, when crowds throng to the Brooklyn Heights promenade to see the fireworks.</p>
        <p>But Frankie Cuomo, who was standing in line with his girlfriend, Yolanda Caruso, does not wait for occasions. ''Every night it's the same thing for me,'' he said. ''A cookie dough milkshake, small.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo said he had seen people rush down the street just before 11 to beat the posted deadline; as the minute hand clicked into place, a surge of new customers materialized. ''Told you,'' Mr. Cuomo said, walking off into the night with his shake and his girl.</p>
        <p>Catherine Whyte, a latecomer who lives in the neighborhood, said she has never even looked at the sign listing the store hours. ''Every time after dinner we're like, 'Oh, I hope it's still open,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, Ms. Whyte was one of the early ones. For the next hour, a stream of adults and children flowed in, pressing their noses against the glass, debating the merits of pistachio, pineapple-coconut and raspberry sorbet.</p>
        <p>At midnight, Mr. Megre walked by and laughed. ''You're still waiting for the last customer?'' He shook his head. ''You'll wait until 2, 3 o'clock.''</p>
