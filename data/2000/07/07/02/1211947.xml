        <p>Clive Campbell, 9, had no trouble waking up on Thursday morning. No trouble at all.

        <p>''Getting him up for school is a struggle,'' said his mother, Janet Lugo, as they waited at the Port Authority Bus Terminal for the bus that would take Clive to Vermont.

        <p>Clive Campbell, 9, had no trouble waking up on Thursday morning. No trouble at all. That morning, the day after school had ended, while his comrades slept in and ate leisurely breakfasts, he woke just before dawn to prepare to leave his apartment in the Bronx for a vacation with a family in Burlington, Vt.</p>
        <p>''Getting him up for school is a struggle,'' said his mother, Janet Lugo, as they waited at the Port Authority Bus Terminal for the bus that would take Clive to Vermont. ''But this morning, I woke him up at 5, and he was up and at 'em. He ironed his clothes, he picked up his room, he talked to his hamsters -- he was ready to go.''</p>
        <p>Clive was one of 800 children who woke that morning to make such a journey -- a two-week vacation sponsored by the Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that provides vacations for needy children from New York City. Most of the children, who were departing from Port Authority Bus Terminal and the George Washington Bridge Bus Station in Washington Heights, had arrived from outside Manhattan. In order to board the buses, which began leaving at 9:30 a.m., many had to wake up as early as Clive had.</p>
        <p>As commuters hustled past to get to work in the city, these city children prepared to leave home in what was the first wave of trips sponsored by the Fresh Air Fund this year. The trips continue through mid-August.</p>
        <p>Some of the children were leaving New York City for the first time in their lives. Others were returning to visit friends they had made during past summers on vacations sponsored by the fund, which pairs the children with families from the country who volunteer to have a child stay with them.</p>
        <p>Some children were nervous. One young girl cried when someone accidentally touched the spot on her arm where she had recently received a shot. But most of the children were euphoric about leaving the confines of their asphalt-and-brick neighborhoods, if only for two weeks.</p>
        <p>After they checked in with the volunteers, they waited for the buses in a fenced-off area at the terminal.</p>
        <p>And they waited. And waited.</p>
        <p>The longest waits were two hours. The agency had to make sure that all the children who had registered could make it to the bus terminal. Volunteers helped pass the time by handing out stuffed animals, entertaining the young audience with marionettes and painting the children's faces. But the wait still seemed much longer than two hours to the children.</p>
        <p>''Is it time to go yet?'' asked Shawn Bailey, 10, who was on his second trip to Great Falls, Va.</p>
        <p>It wasn't time to go just yet, so he and a group of three other boys and two girls all waiting for the bus to Fredericksburg, Va., found other ways to pass the time. They compared lunches, took pictures of one another, wondered aloud whether they'd be the first group to leave (they eventually were), played Pokemon and Donkey Kong on Nintendo Gameboys and started eating their lunches.</p>
        <p>''Five, 10, 15, 20,'' said Jonathan Skinner, 10, of Jamaica, Queens, as he began counting the 20 $5 bills his mother gave him for the trip.</p>
        <p>''I've only got $70,'' said Shawn, at the conclusion of Jonathan's count.</p>
        <p>''I'm rich!'' Jonathan said, and the group launched into a debate on what constitutes rich.</p>
        <p>While the children were getting more and more enthusiastic about their pending departure, their parents and sisters and brothers stood outside the area reserved for them and waved goodbye.</p>
        <p>''Make sure you bring back some pictures,'' said Sheryll Bethea, as she dropped off her 8-year-old sister Shaniqua Pugh for a ride to Wellsville, N.Y., where she would meet her host family for the third time. ''I go outside and play,'' said Shaniqua, who lives with nine people in her apartment in the Bronx, when asked about her vacation in the country. ''We get to go to people's houses and go swimming.''</p>
        <p>The two-week vacations help open the children's eyes to a wider world that is far different from the urban neighborhoods where they live.</p>
        <p>In many cases, the experience gives them a goal to strive for, like one day buying a house in the country or just getting an education. ''I wasn't interested in school, but now I'm going to college,'' said Philomena Marino, an 18-year-old from the Tremont section of the Bronx who boarded a bus to visit the family from Binghamton, N.Y., that she has stayed with for 12 years, even though she is now too old to do so through the agency's program.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marino said she would be staying at the family's home for a year while she attends the state university there. ''It showed me a lot of the differences between the country and the city,'' she said of the program. ''At first I was nervous, but they took me in as one of their own.''</p>
        <p>Families who are interested in having a child stay with them or who wish to inquire about registering their children for a Fresh Air summer vacation may call (800) 367-0003 or visit the agency's Web site, www.freshair.org. Anyone interested in making a tax-deductible contribution to the agency may send a check to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.</p>
