        <p>Brown University is having a Henley Royal Regatta to remember on Henley-on-Thames in London, as both its heavyweight varsity and junior varsity eights advanced in the Ladies' Challenge Plate and Temple Challenge Cup yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Bruins varsity faced the University of California yesterday, gaining the lead at the start of its race.

        <p>Brown University is having a Henley Royal Regatta to remember on Henley-on-Thames in London, as both its heavyweight varsity and junior varsity eights advanced in the Ladies' Challenge Plate and Temple Challenge Cup yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Bruins varsity faced the University of California yesterday, gaining the lead at the start of its race. Californa made a run at Brown as the crews raced down the course, reducing the Bruins' lead to a quarter boatlength at the three-quarter-mile mark, but could do no more. Brown drew away to eliminate California from the regatta and advance to today's final, where it will meet Germany's under-23 national team.</p>
        <p>The anticipated rubber match between the lightweight varsities of Columbia, the Eastern Sprint champion, and Yale, which subsequently defeated Columbia by six-tenths of a second to claim the national championship, got away from Columbia at the start. The two eights raced down the entire course with no more than three-quarters of a boatlength separating them, with Yale winning by a half-length.</p>
        <p>Finals in all 17 cup events will be determined tomorrow.</p>
