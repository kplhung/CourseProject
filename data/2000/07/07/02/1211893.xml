        <p>HAVE bluefish fallen by the wayside? Are shoppers passing it by in favor of fancier and costlier varieties like tuna, salmon and red snapper?</p>
        <p>If so, it's a pity. Bluefish is a local catch, readily available in summer. The fish is full of flavor, but it has drawbacks. Some people complain that it is a strong-tasting fish, a condition that tends to occur mainly when bluefish is not perfectly fresh. Its natural oiliness means that it is rich in healthy omega-3 and that it will have a rich meatiness when cooked.</p>
        <p>Also the flesh is grayish when raw, off-white -- but no darker than swordfish -- when cooked. I wouldn't serve it poached in a cream sauce, but it is excellent broiled, grilled or sauteed.</p>
        <p>The following preparations are best with small, fresh fillets. In each recipe the fish is crisped in a pan and paired with a garnish. For summer, serve at room temperature.</p>
        <p>Bluefish With Potato Salad  Total time: 35 minutes</p>
        <p>1 1/2 pounds small Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and halved  5 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1/4 cup yellow cornmeal  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  4 bluefish fillets, each about 6 ounces  2 cloves garlic, minced  1 bunch scallions, trimmed and chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 pint cherry tomatoes, the smaller the better, halved  Juice of 2 lemons  1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Put potatoes in a saucepan, cover with cold water, bring to a simmer and cook until just tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl. Toss with a tablespoon of olive oil. Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Season cornmeal with salt and pepper and spread on a plate. Dip fish fillets in to coat both sides.</p>
        <p>3. Heat two tablespoons olive oil in a large, heavy skillet, nonstick or cast iron. Saute fish skin side down, about three minutes, turn and saute the other side. Transfer to serving platter. Add another tablespoon oil to skillet. Lower heat to medium low.</p>
        <p>4. Stir in the garlic and saute until golden. Add potatoes, scallions and tomatoes to the skillet and stir-fry a minute or two until tomatoes start to soften. Add the lemon juice and the remaining oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon the mixture over and around the fish and serve dusted with parsley, or set aside up to an hour in order to serve at room temperature.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Bluefish With Asian Slaw  Total time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>1/2 pound jicama, peeled and in julienne slivers  1 medium carrot, peeled and grated  1 cup shredded napa cabbage (Chinese cabbage)  Juice of 2 limes  2 tablespoons rice vinegar  1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger  3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil  3 scallions, trimmed and chopped  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1/4 cup rice flour  1 teaspoon five-spice powder  4 bluefish fillets, each about 6 ounces  2 tablespoons peanut oil  1 tablespoon Chinese oyster sauce  1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro.</p>
        <p>1. Combine jicama, carrot and cabbage in a bowl. Mix lime juice, rice vinegar, ginger and sesame oil together, pour over vegetables and toss. Mix in scallions. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Mix rice flour and five-spice powder. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spread on a plate and dip fish fillets in to coat both sides. Heat peanut oil in a large, heavy skillet, nonstick or cast iron. Saute the fish, skin side up, about two minutes. Turn fillets over, brush fish with oyster sauce and saute on skin side another two to three minutes, until lightly browned. Remove from heat.</p>
        <p>3. Spread vegetable slaw on a platter large enough to hold fish. Put fish, skin side up, on top of slaw, sprinkle with cilantro and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Curried Bluefish With Cucumber-Mint Sauce  Total time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>1/4 cup yellow cornmeal  1 tablespoon curry powder  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  4 bluefish fillets, each about 6 ounces  2 tablespoons grape seed oil  Juice of 1 lime  2 medium-size cucumbers, peeled, seeded and chopped  3 tablespoons finely minced fresh mint leaves  1 teaspoon minced, seeded jalapeno chili</p>
        <p>1 1/3 cups plain yogurt.</p>
        <p>1. Mix cornmeal, curry powder and salt and pepper to taste on a plate. Dip fish in this mixture to coat both sides.</p>
        <p>2. Heat oil in heavy skillet, nonstick or cast iron. Saute fish, skin side down, until lightly browned, about three minutes. Turn over and saute other side about two minutes. Transfer to platter. Sprinkle with lime juice.</p>
        <p>3. Combine cucumbers, mint and jalapeno in a bowl. Fold in yogurt. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon over fish and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
