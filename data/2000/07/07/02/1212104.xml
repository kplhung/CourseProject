        <p>NEW YORK CITY has started on a road that may lead to taxicabs that are able to accommodate wheelchair users in their chairs. The Taxi and Limousine Commissioner, Diane McGrath McKechnie, has submitted a proposal requiring that the city's medallion taxi fleet include such cabs, which are usually minivans modified to provide ramps that fold down in the back or on the side.</p>
        <p>The Americans With Disabilities Act, the federal civil rights law dealing with hotels and motels, trains and buses, airports and public arenas, does not cover taxicabs. But at least 14 cities in the United States and 7 in Canada have accessible cabs in operation, according to research by the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association. These cities include Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Fort Lauderdale, Boston and Las Vegas. A number of them enacted rules requiring these vehicles, almost all since the A.D.A. was signed by President George Bush in 1990.</p>

        <p>NEW YORK CITY has started on a road that may lead to taxicabs that are able to accommodate wheelchair users in their chairs. The Taxi and Limousine Commissioner, Diane McGrath McKechnie, has submitted a proposal requiring that the city's medallion taxi fleet include such cabs, which are usually minivans modified to provide ramps that fold down in the back or on the side.</p>
        <p>The Americans With Disabilities Act, the federal civil rights law dealing with hotels and motels, trains and buses, airports and public arenas, does not cover taxicabs. But at least 14 cities in the United States and 7 in Canada have accessible cabs in operation, according to research by the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association. These cities include Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Fort Lauderdale, Boston and Las Vegas. A number of them enacted rules requiring these vehicles, almost all since the A.D.A. was signed by President George Bush in 1990.</p>
        <p>Accessible taxis have been a goal of Ms. McKechnie's since she got her job in 1996, according to Allan J. Fromberg, the Taxi and Limousine Commission spokesman, but the industry has so far failed to respond. Her proposal, scheduled for a hearing last Thursday, says that effective July 1, 2001, all vehicles equipped to serve as medallion cabs would have to be accessible, as would livery cabs, black cars and limousines unless the dispatching companies elected to arrange for equivalent service.</p>
        <p>A Work in Progress</p>
        <p>Boston has 50 accessible cabs in its medallion fleet of 1,775, and expects to get as many as 50 more by the end of the year. Mark Cohen, the director of licensing for the Boston Police Department, said that after seven years of accessible cabs there, it was still a work in progress. The first batch of vans, for example, used side ramps, and the vans were so low to the ground that they plowed snow. One company that modified vans for wheelchair entry has gone out of business.</p>
        <p>Medallions for modified minivans cost less, to offset the cost of the modifications and the higher cost of operation. The operating life of the vans is also shorter, Mr. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>The demand for use has not been so great as expected but, he said, ''it was a good idea.'' The modified vans are travelers' favorites, he said, because whole families with luggage, with or without a wheelchair, can pile in at the airport. The vans can be hailed on the street or called through a radio dispatcher of any major cab company. ''I don't see how any city could get away without having any,'' Mr. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>In Chicago, the consumer services commisson oversees taxicab regulations. Commissioner Caroline Orzac Shoenberger, a former New Yorker, said her city was probably most like New York. Although there is a great marketing potential for accessible cabs, she said, ''unfortunately, the cities have to mandate.''</p>
        <p>She said that Chicago was asked for accessible taxis by the Multiple Sclerosis Society in 1997 and she got the mayor to allocate $15,000 for a pilot conversion process. She set up a meeting but industry representatives said they should be able to charge wheelchair passengers more because it took longer to get them in and out of a cab. ''Not a good argument,'' Commissioner Shoenberger said, pointing out that loading and unloading strollers also took extra time. She added that state discrimination law if not federal law would look unkindly on a differential.</p>
        <p>A Chicago law was enacted in 1997 and the first accessible cabs, which are side-loading, were on the streets in 1998. If a company has 15 or more medallions, it must have one or more accessible cabs, she said. There are 31 or 32 on the streets now; there will be 35 by September and 8 more by the end of the year. To get one, a customer should call the radio dispatcher of a major company.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shoenberger said that her last case as a lawyer in private practice was a mother with a wheelchair child who had to take on an entire suburban school system, and that this probably influenced her views. ''Transportation should not be a barrier to people's living fruitful lives,'' she said. ''If tourists know they aren't going to be stranded at the airport or the museum, they are going to come. Everyone gains.''</p>
        <p>Cabs to Cruises</p>
        <p>In Fort Lauderdale, Rick Bannister oversees the wheelchair division of the Yellow Cab Company, where 21 out of 541 Yellow Cabs have been modified, with rear ramps. The vans can carry a wheelchair user, four other passengers and the driver.</p>
        <p>Such taxis have been in existence for nine years, and there has been a slow but steady increase in use. On the weekends, Mr. Bannister said, they probably do 25 trips a day between the airport and the cruise-ship pier. The fare to the Fort Lauderdale pier is $10, and to the Port of Miami $55. The company got into this area because the owner, Jessie Gaddis, had a friend who used a wheelchair and had trouble getting a cab. Yellow Cab: (954) 565-2800.</p>
        <p>Las Vegas has 14 cab companies, according to Ken Smith, an investigator for the Las Vegas Taxicab Authority, and there are 27 accessible cabs in operation, two to a company except for one new operator. Las Vegas cabs are dispatched by radio, and a call to any company should bring an accessible cab. The city has had accessible vans for at least 10 years, Mr. Smith believes.</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles, companies were required in 1996 to see that 2 percent of their fleets were accessible cabs. Doris Smith, a senior investigator in the Los Angeles City Department of Transportation, said that 127 were now in service with 10 major companies, all available on call to the dispatcher.</p>
        <p>Iram Rashada, assistant general manager of Los Angeles Checker Cabs, (800) 300-5007, said that 24 of the company's 290 taxis were accessible and have been in the fleet for three or four years.</p>
        <p>San Francisco, according to Nathan Dwiri, president and general manager of the Yellow Cab cooperative there, has authorized 75 accessible cabs, but only 55 are in service. Yellow Cab, (415) 626-2345, has 30 of these ''ramp taxis,'' Mr. Dwiri said.</p>
        <p>A New York livery company, Symphony Transportation, has five Chrysler minivans with side ramps. John Acierno, the head of the overall company, Executive Transportation, said it was a joint project begun in the last year with Easter Seals, whose mission is helping people with disabilities. Easter Seals donated the minivans, each adapted to carry two wheelchairs plus three passengers and a driver, and provided driver training. The company operates the vans, does licensing, call-taking, billing and the like. The reservation number is (800) 253-1443.</p>
        <p>''We do it by advance arrangement,'' Mr. Acierno said, ''and some on an as-soon-as-possible basis. Our goal is to provide an instant response.''</p>
        <p>He said that Executive Transportation would like to see the project expand, and that through his board position in the Black Car Industry Association was talking about how to go further. ''It's time to get up to critical mass,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Taxi and Limousine Commissioner, Ms. McKechnie, said: ''The goal is to see a reasonable number of taxicabs and livery vehicles accessible. It was time to move the process forward.''</p>
