        <p>DECADES before computer graphics, before music videos, even before ''Fantasia'' (the 1940 version), there were the abstract animated films of Oskar Fischinger (1900-1967), master of ''absolute'' or nonobjective filmmaking. He was cinema's Kandinsky, an animator who, beginning in the 1920's in Germany, created exquisite ''visual music'' using geometric patterns and shapes choreographed tightly to classical music and jazz.</p>
        <p>The prolific Fischinger's oeuvre consists of more than 50 short films, in complete or fragmentary form, made using a wide variety of techniques, including wax, clay, charcoal drawings, painted cels and three-dimensional objects. Each film reflects Fischinger's mystical spirituality, a confluence of Hinduism and Buddhism.</p>
        <p>Among his most mesmerizing works are the black-and-white studies he made in the early 1930's, and his Gasparcolor and Technicolor films, like ''Circles'' (1933), ''Composition in Blue'' (1935) and ''Allegretto'' (1936), which display colors and images of spectacular intensity. Fischinger anticipates op and psychedelic art, and his final masterwork, ''Motion Painting No. 1'' (1947), a 10-minute film painted frame by frame on plexiglass over a six-month period in a single, improvised ''take,'' presages the spontaneity of Jackson Pollock's action paintings.</p>
        <p>But the constant surprise is how easily and joyfully Fischinger's films communicate with all sorts of audiences around the world. Far from dry intellectual exercises, his symbols and colors in motion are witty, whimsical and beautiful as well as profound.</p>
        <p>Starting on Thursday and running through the weekend, the Museum of Modern Art will present ''A Fischinger Centennial Celebration,'' a three-part screening series organized by the museum and the Iota Center of Los Angeles in association with the Film Archive of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The academy has restored many of Fischinger's films from 35-millimeter nitrate originals, reconstructing the three-color separations to produce the dazzling images the filmmaker originally planned.</p>
        <p>The series has already played in Oslo and Bologna, Italy, and will move on to Los Angeles; Berkeley, Calif.; Cambridge, Mass., and Washington. This summer will also see the release of a collection of Fischinger films on videocassette, the debut of a Fischinger Web site (available through www.iotacenter.org), and the publication this fall of a first-ever biography, ''Optical Poetry: The Life and Work of Oskar Fischinger'' by William Moritz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moritz, who will lecture on Fischinger's masterworks at the Modern on opening night, teaches the history of both animation and experimental film at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, Calif. ''Fischinger recognized,'' he said by telephone from Los Angeles, ''that moving art -- the cinema -- was a real extension of still painting and drawing.'' As for the enduring appeal of Fischinger's nonobjective animation, he said: ''The 'visual music' idea is an eternal thing. You can experience it just as you can a good piece of music a hundred times. Similarly, you can experience Fischinger's films freshly many times and notice new things. They're vivid in a way the average feature isn't.''</p>
        <p>The films, along with Fischinger's fiercely independent philosophy toward art-making and aesthetic explorations, have inspired several generations of experimental filmmakers, including Norman McLaren, Len Lye, Alexander Alexeieff and Claire Parker, John and James Whitney, Harry Smith, Jordan Belson and Mary Ellen Bute, along with more recent artists like Sara Petty and Robert Darroll in traditional drawn animation, Larry Cuba and Vibeke Sorensen in computer graphics and Michael Scroggins in videographics. Also, Fischinger's theories and experiments with sounds made from ornamental designs were an influence on the music of Edgard Varese and John Cage.</p>
        <p>Fischinger, who was born near Frankfurt, attended a local cinema in 1921 to witness the first abstract film seen in a public screening: ''Lichtspiel Opus 1 (Lightplay)'' by Walther Ruttmann, a filmmaker and visual music pioneer. An animated short of ''dancing'' geometric symbols, it changed his life.</p>
        <p>By the early 1930's, Fischinger, living and working in Berlin, had won renown for his animated advertisements, which were shown in movie theaters, and for special effects for live-action features. This work supported his abstract films, which were widely popular, playing regularly in European theaters and winning prizes in international film festivals (as far away as Japan). ''Fischinger's films have a universal appeal,'' Dr. Moritz said, ''in part because of his deeply ingrained spiritual feeling for the sacredness of the abstract geometrical shape.''</p>
        <p>In 1935, Fischinger and his family were pressured to leave Germany because the Nazi government regarded his experimental cinematic expressionism as ''decadent art.'' Just as Hitler was beginning to crack down on abstract art and artists, Fischinger, luckily, was invited to come to Hollywood to make shorts for Paramount Pictures. Unluckily, it was the beginning of a tragic and frustrating struggle that lasted the rest of his life: the attempt to make ''optical poetry'' in a land and in an industry hostile to nonrepresentational art. His brief tenure at Paramount was disastrous, and at MGM he made only one short -- the elegant ''Optical Poem''(1937) -- just before the Tom and Jerry cartoons took over. At the Walt Disney Studio, he was hired for the Toccata and Fugue section of ''Fantasia,'' but quit in disgust after only nine months. ''The film,'' he later wrote bitterly to a friend, ''is really not my work. . . . Rather, it is the most inartistic product of a factory.''</p>
        <p>He did not fare much better with arts grants. The Guggenheim Foundation's curator, Baroness Hilla Rebay, dispersed a pittance to him over a 10-year period for new work, often with multiple strings attached.</p>
        <p>FISCHINGER, his wife Elfriede and their five children often depended on the kindness of strangers for survival. Orson Welles admired Fischinger's films and hired him to work on the Mercury Productions feature for RKO ''It's All True'' in the early '40s, and kept him on his personal payroll for a while when that project fell through.</p>
        <p>Fischinger's last complete film, ''Motion Painting No. 1,'' won the Grand Prix at the 1949 Brussels Experimental Film Competition, but the prize carried no monetary reward. No commissions followed, and there was, as usual, no theatrical distribution for the film. Ultimately, Fischinger abandoned expensive filmmaking and turned to painting abstract canvases, which became the prime creative outlet of his last 20 years.</p>
        <p>His struggles might be a cautionary tale for today's nonobjective experimental moving-image makers; but many find his story inspiring, even heroic. ''He never catered to any perceived taste of his audience,'' said Larry Cuba, a computer animator who created graphics for the original ''Star Wars'' but now works exclusively on personal abstract projects. ''He always stayed true to himself and his art despite many hardships and obstacles.'' Mr. Cuba is also a founder of IOTA, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit arts organization dedicated to ''promoting and preserving the art of light and movement.'' The Fischinger centenary celebration is the first of a series of annual IOTA traveling programs of abstraction-animation-music works called ''Kinetica.''</p>
        <p>''It's always important to see what's been done before,'' Mr. Cuba said. ''As a leader in bringing the modern-art sensibility of abstraction to film animation, Oskar Fischinger was unique to the world.''</p>
