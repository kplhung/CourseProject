        <p>Five women who are believed to have received second-rate mammograms from two radiologists whose licenses have been suspended showed signs of breast cancer after being retested, state health officials said yesterday.</p>

        <p>Five women who are believed to have received second-rate mammograms from two radiologists whose licenses have been suspended showed signs of breast cancer after being retested, state health officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The women are among more than 11,000 patients who were examined in the last five years by the doctors, Steven J. Bier and Mario DiBlasio, who provided government-financed breast cancer screenings to poor women in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The New York State health commissioner, Dr. Antonia C. Novello, suspended their licenses in May, accusing them of conducting inaccurate diagnostic tests and billing for services they did not provide.</p>
        <p>After the suspensions, the State Health Department said it would try to find the doctors' patients and retest them at state expense.</p>
        <p>So far, 2,100 of the 11,000 patients have been screened.</p>
        <p>Of those, 400 need additional testing, including the five who showed strong indications of breast cancer, officials said. Those five women must now have biopsies to determine if they actually do have cancer, authorities said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bier's lawyer, Barry Berke, said yesterday that his client ''has always had the health and welfare of his patients as his highest priority.''</p>
        <p>''Because Dr. Bier is concerned with the best interest of his patients, he has been assisting and locating patient records to review and has been conducting his own review of the actual facts,'' Mr. Berke said. ''He is confident that after a full examination of the facts as opposed to ambiguous and unreliable statistical inferences he will be completely vindicated.''</p>
        <p>Dr. DiBlasio, when reached by telephone yesterday, said that he had been unaware of the findings involving the five women -- which were reported yesterday in The Daily News and The New York Post -- but would not comment further.</p>
        <p>In earlier interviews he said that he was being unfairly maligned by the state.</p>
        <p>John Signor, a spokesman for the Health Department, said it was not clear if the five women whose tests display indications of breast cancer developed their conditions before or after the two doctors screened them.  But, he said, the poor quality of Dr. Bier's mammograms was obvious.</p>
        <p>''Through law enforcement we received about 300 mammograms done by Dr. Biers's office, and our experts have reviewed those and basically found them to be totally inadequate, which raises other concerns,'' Mr. Signor said.</p>
