        <p>LONG before the Greco-Roman specter of Lady Liberty arrived in New York Harbor in 1886, another woman symbolized the United States, one long forgotten by most Americans. Sometimes known as L'Amerique, or the Indian Princess, she was a Native American figure who first appeared on maps in the 16th century. Wearing a feather headdress, accompanied by a parrot and perched on an alligatorlike reptile, she represented continental America alongside female allegories of Europe, Asia and Africa.</p>
        <p>''She's big, naked and exotic, portrayed with the plants and animals of the New World,'' said Rayna Green, director of the American Indian Program at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. ''She is America, which is rich, powerful, opulent and perilous.''</p>

        <p>LONG before the Greco-Roman specter of Lady Liberty arrived in New York Harbor in 1886, another woman symbolized the United States, one long forgotten by most Americans. Sometimes known as L'Amerique, or the Indian Princess, she was a Native American figure who first appeared on maps in the 16th century. Wearing a feather headdress, accompanied by a parrot and perched on an alligatorlike reptile, she represented continental America alongside female allegories of Europe, Asia and Africa.</p>
        <p>''She's big, naked and exotic, portrayed with the plants and animals of the New World,'' said Rayna Green, director of the American Indian Program at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. ''She is America, which is rich, powerful, opulent and perilous.''</p>
        <p>This early character, along with Liberty and the lesser-known Columbia, is the subject of ''The Changing Face of Liberty: Female Allegories of America,'' at the New-York Historical Society through Sept. 3. Featuring political cartoons, maps, prints and advertising ephemera by Paul Revere, Jean-Honore Fragonard, Nathan Currier and others, the small but illuminating show reveals how these figures have symbolized this country for more than four centuries.</p>
        <p>The exhibition comes at a time when two real native women have seen renewed popularity. Sacagawea, the Shoshone woman who guided Lewis and Clark, appears on the widely promoted new dollar coin, a billion of which will be issued by the end of the year. And Disney recently adapted the story of Pocahontas, the 17th-century Algonquin who saved the British adventurer John Smith from execution by her father, Powhatan, in a highly successful animated film. Like these real heroines, the early Indian figure symbolized bravery and compassion in the New World -- even if her actions might have put her in opposition to her own people.</p>
        <p>Some of the earliest cartoons of this persona were by British caricaturists who supported the colonies' struggle for independence. During Revolutionary times, she was decked out in feathers, but she was slimmer than the cartographers' figure. Wielding a bow and arrow, she often appeared as Britannia's rebellious daughter.</p>
        <p>''The Able Doctor, or America Swallowing the Bitter Draught,'' a violent 1774 engraving first published in London Magazine after the Boston Tea Party, portrays a native woman, stripped to the waist, being pinned to the ground by wigged Britons. (Paul Revere copied this picture for publication in America.) The figure of Britannia looks away in despair as one man forces the supine princess to swallow the Boston Port Bill, in the form of tea, which she defiantly spits back in his face. Another man, Lord Sandwich, peers up her skirt. (The peeping Lord Sandwich ''was known to be an old letch,'' said the exhibition's curator, Ann Weissmann.)</p>
        <p>Most images depict the native woman more favorably. In ''Liberty Triumphant; or the Downfall of Oppression,'' a 1774 engraving by an American caricaturist, she leads the colonists, who are wearing feathered headgear and armed with bows and arrows, into battle with the British. The devil accompanies the British Army, while the goddess of liberty, holding a liberty pole and cap -- the latter adapted from the Phrygian cap, worn by freed Roman slaves to cover their shaved heads -- hovers over the Americans. As with other broadsides, illustrations like these, with balloon texts, expressed editorial views for those who could read and those who could not.</p>
        <p>The Indian Princess started looking more Anglo-European as the colonies matured. ''She becomes white and neo-classical,'' Ms. Green said. ''She wears the white robes that symbolize innocence and the democracy of Greece and Rome, which people are talking about in colonial rhetoric. She might have Columbia's Wonder Woman crown of stars or Miss Liberty's cap.'' In the exhibition, Charles Lemire Sr.'s 19th-century etching ''L'Amerique'' shows the white-robed woman looking distinctly like Roman aristocracy. As Ms. Green sees it, ''ultimately, we get the Princess Pocahontas'' as the figure evolves into a beauty-queen persona not unlike Disney's interpretation of the Algonquin girl. ''She is the idealized princess who saves America from her bad brothers and fathers,'' Ms. Green said.</p>
        <p>If the native figure represented America's rebellious spirit, the goddesslike Columbia, with her shield and starred tiara, signified American strength after the Revolution, with the threat of Britain still in recent memory. ''The Indian Princess started disappearing because America wanted a more dominant image -- more powerful, aggressive,'' Ms. Weissmann said. ''Columbia represented the mature, stable, independent colonies. She was the older daughter of Britannia, while the Indian Princess was the younger one.''</p>
        <p>Columbia and Liberty are often interchangeable star-spangled figures in the exhibition's 19th- and early 20th-century political cartoons, posters and advertisements. John H. Goater's 1861 wood-engraved cartoon ''Little Bo-Peep and her Foolish Sheep'' shows a worried Liberty posing as a shepherdess and representing the Union, watching as her sheep, standing for the seceding Southern states, run away. Columbia is the more warriorlike. ''Columbia is usually armed,'' says Wendy Shadwell, curator of prints at the New-York Historical Society. By contrast, the Statue of Liberty ''just stands there with a tablet and a lamp.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi's Roman-size monument, with her spiked crown and book of law, is closer to European versions of Liberte than American ones, and has ''no relation'' to Columbia or the Indian figure, said Jeff Dosik, a librarian at the Statue of Liberty National Monument. A gift to the United States from France, the continental Liberty symbolized ''the Enlightenment ideas that our founding fathers borrowed from French philosophers -- about political freedom for all mankind, and human rights for all men,'' Mr. Dosik said.</p>
        <p>CARICATURISTS quickly adopted the statue as the prevailing image of America, even before it arrived in New York. Thomas Nast's 1881 engraving for Harper's Weekly, ''A Warning Light,'' made when a rash of deadly epidemics seized New York, shows a skeletal Liberty with an upside-down torch and the caption ''Leave All Hope Ye That Enter Here.'' A reproduction of an 1885 wood engraving by Frederick Burr Opper, published in Puck, parodies the way in which the statue was exploited by advertisers even before it took up residence: wearing sunglasses, she's plastered with ads urging people to ''smoke 'suredeath' cigarettes'' and buy from ''G.O.G.G.L.E.S. opticians.''</p>
        <p>The exhibition's contemporary section includes some patriotic knickknacks that, while amusing, don't shed a lot of new light on these figures.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most revealing and contradictory symbol of America is Thomas Crawford's 1863 Statue of Freedom atop the United States Capitol, illustrated in the exhibition by a modern copy of an 1867 engraving Crawford made for Harper's Weekly. Erected during the Civil War under Abraham Lincoln's supervision, the sculpture is a hybrid of Liberty, Columbia and the Indian Princess. The original design featured the liberty cap, but Jefferson Davis, then the secretary of war and later the president of the Confederacy, insisted that the headpiece -- and its associations with emancipation -- be replaced. Crawford revised it to the current starry helmet and feathers. Philip Reed, a slave, supervised the statue's casting.</p>
        <p>When the Statue of Freedom was taken down to ground level for cleaning a few years ago, Ms. Green recalled, ''she was repeatedly visited by Indians who came to pay her homage.''</p>
        <p>''It was quite interesting to see this pilgrimage,'' she said. ''Indians recognized her as their girl. It would cause a revolution if people remembered that Freedom was originally an Indian woman.''</p>
