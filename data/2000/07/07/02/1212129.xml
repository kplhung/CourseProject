        <p>ON an exceptionally warm evening in May, perfect for strolling in Belgrade's romantic Kalemegdan Park, a threatening band of masked thugs, naked to the waist, broke into the university's school of architecture. Swinging truncheons, they attacked students who were occupying the building to protest the Serbian government's latest rash of academic firings and its crackdown on a growing political movement known as Otpor (Resistance). Scores were injured. One young woman lost an eye.</p>
        <p>The next day citizens gathered in rage at Students Square and publicly ridiculed a regime-appointed dean who told students to abandon politics and get back to their books. It was easily the 200th such protest this decade.</p>
        <p>Welcome to Belgrade, the hometown of Biljana Srbljanovic (pronounced bill-YAN-ah serb-LYAN-oh-vitch), Serbia's leading young playwright, who, at 29, sometimes feels trapped in her own never-ending play, doomed to repeat until the actors triumph over the repressive regime or self-combust trying.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Srbljanovic, whose work is winning critical acclaim both at home (her first play, ''Belgrade Trilogy,'' took top Yugoslav honors) and in Germany, where some 40 theaters will have staged one of her four plays by the year's end, the turbulence played out almost daily on the streets of Belgrade creates a dilemma shared by many in today's Serbia.</p>
        <p>As she explained during a telephone interview on that violent May evening, the dark reality outside her window intruding on the conversation, the dilemma is a universal one: how to construct a moral life from conflicting, imperfect choices. In her words, the choices run something like this: Stay and fight. Leave in search of a more ''normal life'' (and perhaps be miserable.) Stay and give in to some variant of Balkan fatalism, amnesia or fascism.</p>
        <p>Ms. Srbljanovic, who was 10 when Josip Broz Tito died, believes her generation must decide whether to be actors in the moral, historical and cultural vortex into which they were hurled or to surrender, letting history pull them along like broken twigs in a rising creek. In Serbia, the political is personal. These same conflicts shape her plays. Ms. Srbljanovic and her characters wrestle obsessively with the difficult consequences of their actions, or inactions.</p>
        <p>''Belgrade Trilogy'' (included in ''Eastern Promise: Seven Plays From Central and Eastern Europe,'' Theater Communications Group) takes up this stay-or-leave theme through three snapshot stories of young people who fled Serbia to avoid forced military service and dead-end jobs. In the play, written in 1996 when Ms. Srbljanovic was a drama student at the University of Belgrade, outsiders in Prague, Sydney and Los Angeles spend New Year's Eve lamenting what (and whom) they have lost as they struggle to create new lives. Belgrade-style black humor mitigates this starkly realistic take on exile life.</p>
        <p>By the time ''Belgrade Trilogy'' was written, at least 200,000 of Serbia's best and brightest had voted with their feet, rejecting the bloodshed, virulent nationalism and chaos gripping their homeland. ''Many dear friends and young intellectuals left,'' Ms. Srbljanovic said. ''And the hemorrhaging continues.''</p>
        <p>In her second play, ''Family Stories: Belgrade,'' which made its North American debut in a student production at the Yale School of Drama in April, one character's parents try to prevent him from either leaving or staying and becoming a politically engaged citizen.</p>
        <p>This highly theatrical, farcical psychodrama, in which adult actors play children playing adults playing house in a violently dysfunctional family, has Bertolt Brecht's fingerprints all over it, a debt Ms. Srbljanovic freely acknowledges. In one scene, the play's children are told that the gravest sin, the one with the harshest penalty, is to admit to an independent thought and risk unspoken reprisals, beatings and worse.</p>
        <p>Ms. Srbljanovic believes this fear ''for our own naked existence,'' passed down like mother's milk from one generation to the next, must be supplanted with a ''fear for our own moral downfall if we fail to speak'' wherever repression, nationalism or immorality appear.</p>
        <p>Her activist philosophy and the fact that she was among the first to support a university strike over recent student beatings has endeared Ms. Srbljanovic to her generation. ''She is not just a 'vox populi' but a symbol of courage who speaks about previously untouchable things,'' said Nebojsa Krivokuca, 25, a drama student who is drafting his own radio play. ''For us, Srbljanovic is the right playwright to engage audiences in these dark times.'' Remarkably, she has so far avoided censorship or the harshest forms of intimidation.</p>
        <p>''The Fall,'' Ms. Srbljanovic's third play, will have its premiere on Friday at the Grad theater in Budva in Montenegro. The play ''is a bitter, sarcastic spoof, a mythological play laced with Serbian legends,'' said Jovan Cirilov, 69, the play's dramaturge, who managed the Yugoslav Drama Theater in Belgrade until it burned down a few years ago. ''It speaks about the calcification of a nation and Western morality at the end of millennium.''</p>
        <p>The inspiration for ''The Fall'' sprang in part from an Umberto Eco essay on the roots of fascism, Ms. Srbljanovic said. ''Eco says fascism happens when people aren't paying attention,'' she said. ''The play is not just about Serbia's problems.''</p>
        <p>Gorcin Stojanovic, who is directing ''The Fall,'' agrees, saying, ''Biljana's work is important because she is asking questions about the reasons and roots of our misfortune, our responsibility and guilt, twisting the knife in our wounds mercilessly.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stojanovic tried to do the same thing in his 1994 adaptation of ''The Last Days of Mankind,'' an antiwar tragedy by the Austrian satirist Karl Kraus. ''With Biljana's work I no longer have to look to foreign plays for the subject matter I'm also obsessed with,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Filip David, a Belgrade writer and intellectual and a former professor of Ms. Srbljanovic's, said she had been much sought after since ''Family Stories'' was translated in Germany's leading stage magazine, Theater Heute, in January 1999. During the NATO bombing last year, Hamburg's Schauspielhaus theater invited her to come and produce her plays. ''It was an amazing opportunity,'' said Mr. David. ''It would've been easy for her to leave.''</p>
        <p>But as for so many others in her generation, this ''opportunity'' was also an agonizing and ultimately impossible choice. ''My life so far has been dedicated to the fight here,'' Ms. Srbljanovic said. ''So I couldn't leave. I also thought if I took the Schauspielhaus offer, I would soon bore the Germans and then disgust and bore myself.''</p>
        <p>Instead, she stayed in Serbia and wrote a column -- a 78-day bombing diary -- that appeared in Der Speigel, La Republica and The Guardian. ''This work kept me sane and occupied during the war,'' Ms. Srbljanovic said. The high-profile writing gig also made her a lightning rod. The government labeled the blatantly antinationalist pieces ''traitorous.'' Some in Belgrade's literary establishment, not above denigrating its own, cited the columns as one example of Ms. Srbljanovic's proclivity for self-promotion and her tendency to write things likely to be published in the West.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cirilov dismisses these critics: ''It's easy for all older, middle-aged and young writers to be jealous. Biljana is beautiful, charming, tough and, most important, very talented. She has a clear, brave way of thinking.''</p>
        <p>WITH the just-completed ''Supermarket,'' her fourth and most autobiographical work, Ms. Srbljanovic hopes to move on with her art and life, away from the chaos and darkness many outsiders choose to see as peculiar to the Balkans.</p>
        <p>''Supermarket'' will have its premiere in 2001 at the Vienna Festival. It is a more traditionally structured play, with details reminiscent of the satiric television show ''The Simpsons,'' which Ms. Srbljanovic admires greatly. ''It's about life in a very small place,'' she said. ''But things going on there have a larger importance.''  ''Supermarket'' is also Ms. Srbljanovic's story and that of anyone with the means to exit an uncomfortable life.</p>
        <p>Set in a small provincial town somewhere in Austria or East Germany, ''Supermarket,'' is about a high school principal who has spent the decade since the fall of the Berlin Wall fabricating his own past. ''He creates a dossier for himself,'' Ms. Srbljanovic said, ''in which he brags about his prior life as an important dissident always attacking the regime. He creates this file on himself because as an outsider, a newcomer, he feels left out. But even when he reveals it is all a forgery, no one cares.''</p>
        <p>She said that ''Supermarket'' also posed questions for those in her generation who had given up 10 years of their lives to the Yugoslav political struggle.</p>
        <p>''I am nearly 30,'' she said. ''I have no family of my own, no apartment of my own. I live like a student. This principal, my character, is a metaphor for all of us. It asks, 'What about my life? My youth?' ''</p>
        <p>Despite her growing recognition abroad, Ms. Srbljanovic is clear about one thing: ''I do not want to be 'a Serbian curiosity' used by people too unsophisticated to realize that we are not monochromatic. I represent, along with hundreds and hundreds of my generation and my elders, the other face of Serbia.''</p>
        <p>She also does not want to revisit the same terrain over and over. ''I don't want to become like Oliver Stone, whose films always seem to be fighting the same war,'' she said. ''I don't want to be trapped by my own history and the coincidence of my birth.''</p>
