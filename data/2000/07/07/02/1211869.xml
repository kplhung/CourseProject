        <p>The Village of Port Jefferson has declared the plan by McDonald's for an outlet next to the village hall dead, saying McDonald's failed to pursue the project during the past nine months and let the site plan expire.</p>
        <p>But the McDonald's franchisee, David Sambo, disputed that contention, and said he had turned the matter over to his lawyer.</p>
        <p>''I have landscaping plans and I ordered kitchen equipment,'' he said. ''We are determined to open, and the majority of residents in Port Jefferson feel that way, too. We hope to open by the end of the year.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Jeanne Garant, who was elected last year on a pledge to fight the McDonald's, said the planning board discovered the permit had expired last month after a court rejected a suit by a civic association to keep the restaurant from opening. ''Can you imagine my sigh of relief,'' Ms. Garant said.</p>
        <p>She said the village board, after consulting local civic and business groups, adopted an ordinance last week that bans all fast-food restaurants. Ms. Garant said a previous ordinance had failed to spell that out adequately.</p>
        <p>The mayor stressed that she is not against McDonald's, only a ''proliferation of fast-food restaurants.''</p>
        <p>''Then we would lose our unique character and become something different from what we want to be,'' she continued. ''Although there are some young families who would love to have McDonald's here, I think the sense of the community is that we are doing the right thing.''</p>
        <p>The McDonald's issue was a factor in local elections last month, after which a trustee, Frederick T. Boerum, said he was defeated for re-election for arguing that McDonald's was legally entitled to open.</p>
