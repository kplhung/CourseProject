        <p>Suzanne McConnell letter notes Paul Theroux's June 11 review of Paul Schneider's book Enduring Shore: A History of Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket failed to mention creation in 1961 of Cape Cod National Seashore</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a 20-year summer resident of Cape Cod and the author of two articles on it, I appreciated Paul Theroux's knowledgeable, thoughtful review of Paul Schneider's book ''The Enduring Shore: A History of Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket'' (June 11). Theroux concludes by lamenting the changes for the worse on the Cape and Islands, stating that ''their decay could have been prevented.'' But he fails to mention the Cape Cod National Seashore -- 43,557 acres on the Outer Cape -- created by a bill that was signed into law by President John F. Kennedy in 1961. The National Seashore was controversial at the time; land profiteers fought it. To the credit of Cape Codders, preservation won out. The 40-mile sweep of shoreline that Thoreau called ''the Great Beach'' remains unspoiled.</p>
