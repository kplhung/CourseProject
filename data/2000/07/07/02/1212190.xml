        <p>Richard Jay Scholem reviews DiMaggio's restaurant in Glen Cove, Long Island, which has been taken over by Mario Silvestri family and will soon be renamed A Tarantella (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>DiMAGGIO'S, in Glen Cove, understandably attracted a large following during its relatively short history at 274 Glen Street (516-671-9323), with its vibrantly seasoned, authentic, Italian soul food and many early-bird dinner values. When the restaurant was sold a couple of months ago to the Mario Silvestri family, a friendly Italian crew who own ''A'' Tarantella in Brooklyn, it no doubt seemed logical to retain DiMaggio's menu while adding their own. Even before the restaurant's name changes, its menus proclaim ''DiMaggio's-soon-to-become 'A' Tarantella.''</p>
        <p>Although the maneuver might reassure regular patrons, DiMaggio's menu is big and Tarantella's is bigger. Together, they overload any kitchen and especially one with a new cast still adjusting to its surroundings. (Tina and Mario Silvestri, a mother-and-son team, are at work there, alongside DiMaggio's remaining chef). This perhaps is the reason for the pervasive unevenness during a number of visits.</p>

        <p>DiMAGGIO'S, in Glen Cove, understandably attracted a large following during its relatively short history at 274 Glen Street (516-671-9323), with its vibrantly seasoned, authentic, Italian soul food and many early-bird dinner values. When the restaurant was sold a couple of months ago to the Mario Silvestri family, a friendly Italian crew who own ''A'' Tarantella in Brooklyn, it no doubt seemed logical to retain DiMaggio's menu while adding their own. Even before the restaurant's name changes, its menus proclaim ''DiMaggio's-soon-to-become 'A' Tarantella.''</p>
        <p>Although the maneuver might reassure regular patrons, DiMaggio's menu is big and Tarantella's is bigger. Together, they overload any kitchen and especially one with a new cast still adjusting to its surroundings. (Tina and Mario Silvestri, a mother-and-son team, are at work there, alongside DiMaggio's remaining chef). This perhaps is the reason for the pervasive unevenness during a number of visits.</p>
        <p>Although both sides of the menu (home-style Neapolitan and classic golden oldies) have lost a little of their luster, it's still possible to have a satisfying meal. Appetizers, although over-priced in comparison to entrees (there are $10.50 pastas, $12 and $14 seafood and meat main dishes, while starters run from $8.50 to more than $14), offer especially enticing choices.</p>
        <p>The Caesar salad ($7) is ''classic,'' as the menu claims, with its fresh greens, tangy dressing and tiny, garlicky croutons, and the antipasto buffet ($14 for two, $7 for one) is far superior to the usual salami and cheese mix. Its oniony, eggy frittata, marinated eggplant and tomatoes, grilled zucchini, peas and cheese- and radish-crowned stuffed mushroom all show thought and effort. The broth in an earthy pasta fagioli ($5) isn't thick but it is tasty, as are its onion, cannellini bean and prosciutto. But an appetizer of arugula, with baby shrimp and Fontana cheese, held little dressing, seasoning or interest. The shrimp, atop greens, weren't warm, and the portion size certainly did not justify the $11 price. The bruschetta ($6.50), three pieces of tomato, onion, olive oil- and garlic-soaked Italian bread, arrived with burned crusts.</p>
        <p>Pastas are gently priced. Half portions ordered as starters are an economical choice. A husky, peasanty, version of gnocchi ($11), served with chopped tomato and mozzarella or any number of sauces, was slightly doughy from undercooking. Better was a simple penne Siciliana ($10.50), with fresh eggplant, tomatoes and mozzarella. Risotto pescatore ($10.50), seafood mixed with Arborio rice, was soothing but soupy rather than creamy. (For a few dollars more the kitchen will add two little lobster tails.)</p>
        <p>Copy-cat accompaniments like boiled potatoes, firm green beans and chopped tomatoes are presented with meat and fish selections, many of which, under the new kitchen regime, have a homespun, Neapolitan slant. Most of the ones I sampled were in the satisfactory to ordinary category. Veal Marsala ($16), in a heady, winey mushroom sauce, was tougher than it should be. Gamberi oreganata ($15), eight tender, medium-size shrimp covered by bread crumbs and a mellow oreganata sauce, got passing grades, as did a tasty (but chewy) spezzatino alla titinella ($16.50). This stew of soup meat, onions and fried potatoes in a bold, rich rose sauce is best suited for folks who relish robust flavor and are undeterred by a bit too much gristle and fat. In many ways this full-bodied, though unrefined ''Tina's specialty'' presentation, which offers flavor, not finesse, represents ''A'' Tarantella's Naples-Brooklyn roots.</p>
        <p>A dry, grainy ricotta cheese cake ($5), refreshing sorbets stuffed into lemon, pineapple and coconut shells ($4.50) and a tiramisu ($5) that will appeal to coffee lovers as much as chocoholics concluded the meal.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>Rudi's, a family restaurant serving Central American and Italian food, owned by DiMaggio's Restaurants of Port Washington and Little Neck, opened three months ago at 247 Mineola Boulevard in Mineola (516-873-0018). The informal, 60-seat spot, with two chefs -- one Italian and one Salvadoran -- offers Latino entrees like pupusas, chorizos and rice and beans in the $8 to $10 bracket and Italian ones for a few dollars more. Rudi Miranda, a part owner, also cooks the Central American dishes.</p>
        <p>Cantina Di Pomodoro, a 24-seat, wine bar offering 40 wines by the glass and a limited blackboard menu of fish, pasta and meat, will soon replace the Pomodoro Market, at 62 Steward Avenue in Huntington. The chef, Luca Cullati from Hotel Cipriani in Borgoseia, Italy, will prepare three to six entrees daily. In addition to dinner and 350 wines, priced from $12 to $5,000 a bottle, the restaurant, owned by the Pomodoro-Pomodorino Group, will also offer wine and cheese snacks.</p>
        <p>The 200-seat White Water Grill (631-728-7373) opened on North Road in Hampton Bays in May, replacing Riptides. Its seafood-dominated menu, with two exceptions, contains dinner entrees from $16 to $21. The chef, Ken Pulomena, who came from Blue Water Grill, Dock's and John Clancy in Manhattan, prepares a blackened catfish with a sweet-potato crab hash in his own voodoo sauce.</p>
        <p>The Ted Milan Steak House, at 36 East Park Avenue in Long Beach (516-670-0007), which opened about six months ago, is a 55-seat spot, with a wall-size mural of old Long Beach, antique mirrors and a pressed tin ceiling. In addition to steaks, chops, chicken and fish dishes (which include salad and vegetable) in the $13.95 to $29.95 category, Debra Hladky, the executive chef, who worked at Lutece, the Polo Grill and Tupelo Honey, prepares creative weekly specials.</p>
        <p>Potpourri</p>
        <p>Aristodemos Pavlou, the chef at Coeur des Vignes, 57225 Main Road, Southold (631-765-2656), and Charles Drayton, the kitchen commander at Snapper Inn, 500 Shore Drive in Oakdale (631-589-0248), were among the chefs who were recently inducted into the Long Island Hall of Fame at the Great Chef Gala 2000. They received ''The Culinary Award of Distinction'' from the Suffolk Community College Culinary Arts Program and Foundation.</p>
        <p>Vincenzo Ricci is now a part owner of Matteo's restaurant, 300 West Jericho Turnpike, Huntington Station (516-421-6001). Mr. Ricci was a captain at Monte Carlo in Jamaica, Queens; a manager of La Terrazza, Cedarhurst, and a partner at Pasta Brokers, on York Avenue in Manhattan. There is also a new chef at Matteo's: Anthony Pizzuto, who spent six years at Umberto's of New Hyde Park, moved to Pippo's in Cedarhurst and then to Russo's on the Bay in Palermo, Sicily.</p>
        <p>Table 48 in Glen Cove (516-674-4848) has a new spring menu and pre-theater, three-course prix fixe for $30. It is offered between 5:30 and 6 p.m. daily. The restaurant guarantees to get patrons to Westbury Music Fair, Tilles Center and the deSversky Center by 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>Jerry and David's Red Horse Market, at 74 Montauk Highway, East Hampton (631-329-6655), is offering a special Sunday brunch-to-go menu.</p>
        <p>Pacific East, 415 Main Street, Amagansett (631-267-7770), will hold Long Island Wine Tasting Dinners every Wednesday through August. Each will feature a five-course dinner prepared by Michael Castino, with each course paired with a wine from the featured vineyard of the evening. The cost of the dinners will vary from $39.95 to $59.95.</p>
        <p>Sweetwaters Bar and Bistro, 470 Wheeler Road, Hauppauge (631-348-0808), now offers live entertainment six days a week, Monday through Thursday from 6 to 10 p.m., and on Friday and Saturday from 9:30 to 10:30 p.m.</p>
