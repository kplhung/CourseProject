        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Marriage Insurance for the Young'' (Preludes, June 18), which discussed prenuptial agreements for young couples:</p>
        <p>The column said that ''of the nearly 230,000 marriages that begin in June, more than half will end in divorce.'' That statement will probably prove incorrect.</p>
        <p>Such assertions, though often heard about the divorce rate, are based on data from recent history but, of course, do not necessarily project the future.</p>
        <p>From 1980 to 1997, the United States divorce rate dropped significantly. Today, demographers believe that it is more accurate to say that about 40 percent of all recent marriages are likely to end in divorce.</p>
        <p>But even that figure may be misleading in reference to young adults, because it includes not only first-time marriages, but also second and third marriages, which are significantly more divorce-prone.</p>
        <p>It is thus likely that more than 60 percent of this year's first-time marriages will last for life.</p>
