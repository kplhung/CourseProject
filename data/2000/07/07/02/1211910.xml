        <p>REBECCA RUGG read Biljana Srbljanovic's play ''Family Stories: Belgrade'' in the German magazine Theater Heute in March 1999, just as NATO began bombing Belgrade. Ms. Rugg, a dramaturgy and criticism graduate of the Yale School of Drama, translated it for the university's theater magazine this spring.</p>
        <p>''Here was a play that challenged and complicated the images of Serbia we were getting on CNN,'' Ms. Rugg said. ''The more I learned about political events over the past decade in Yugoslavia, the more moving and shocking the context of the play became.''</p>
        <p>Somewhere into the translation project, Lisa Channer, also a May Yale graduate, agreed to direct a student workshop production, which ran for three performances at the end of April.</p>
        <p>With only three weeks to dissect a very dense play and put it on the stage, Ms. Channer, 34, was the right person for the job. Before coming to Yale, she had run her own company, Sleeveless Theater, in Northampton, Mass. ''We created and produced original, mostly political works,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Channer was drawn to the absurdist touches in ''Family Stories: Belgrade'' and to a pivotal dream sequence in which three actors speak in the Brechtian sense not as players but as themselves. ''The play engages the audience and is cathartic in a profound and disquieting way,'' Ms. Channer said. ''The characters don't intellectualize; they act their lives and inflict their wounds.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, what kept them all going was what Ms. Rugg, 27, called Ms. Srbljanovic's theatrical craft and the play's sophisticated dramaturgy. ''The play lives on so many levels and creates its politics without being overly didactic,'' Ms. Rugg said.</p>
        <p>As graduate students, the two women were insulated from the risks that make many American resident theaters unadventurous and reluctant to cross geographic and linguistic borders. But bringing this dark, highly theatrical and farcical social-psychodrama to the stage was so grueling that at times, Ms. Rugg said here after the student production, ''everyone involved went a little crazy.''</p>
        <p>''We lived this madness onstage and were forced to look inward,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rugg worried about the intellectual ethics and linguistic challenge of the double remove: translating a Serbo-Croatian work from the German without making it sound too American. But, she said, ''the German translation was a very good and close one, and I ran mine by a lot of Yugoslavs.''</p>
        <p>AS for how such a disturbing play -- in which adults play children in a violently disturbed household -- might be interpreted by American audiences, Ms. Srbljanovic said simply: ''I never thought 'Family Stories: Belgrade' would be seen outside of Serbia when I wrote it.''</p>
        <p>In Germany, where more than 20 theaters have produced the play, audiences had no trouble identifying with its themes. As Ms. Srbljanovic said: ''Right after World War II, family life there was often psychologically destructive. The older generation had its secrets; elders were in denial or felt guilty about their roles under the Nazis, or had informed on their neighbors. Many didn't want change, and the kids suffered most. It is the same in any society in transition where there is a generational divide.''</p>
        <p>''This is hard-core social shock theater,'' she continued, ''where nothing is smooth or real. Everything is distorted and exaggerated from a child's vantage point, which is always a deconstructed view of reality.'' She compared it to viewing life through a funhouse mirror.</p>
        <p>To Ms. Channer and Ms. Rugg, ''Family Stories: Belgrade'' is more than a play about Serbia's dirty laundry. ''Biljana lives in a propagandistic society,'' Ms. Rugg said. ''So do we -- just a different one. This play includes our role in her culture's destruction.''</p>
