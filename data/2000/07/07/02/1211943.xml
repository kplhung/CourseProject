        <p>While the friendship and reconciliation that emerged from the Korean summit meeting two weeks ago was surprising, and sudden, officials here insist that actual unification is years, if not decades, away and can be achieved only gradually.</p>
        <p>South Korean officials have paid close attention to Germany's unification -- in which an economically stronger country swiftly absorbed its weaker brother -- and have determined, in the words of Park Jie Won, minister of culture and tourism, ''that it will not work on the Korean peninsula.''</p>
        <p>''North Korea would never agree to it, and South Korea's economy would not survive the high costs,'' Mr. Park said in an interview.</p>
        <p>However, if there is another thing to be learned from Germany's unification, it is that such processes are unpredictable and can happen faster than almost anybody expects. The leaders of East and West Germany did not plan to rush their reunification, but as thousands of East Germans overwhelmed the border, there was no choice but to merge quickly.</p>
        <p>The costs to South Korea in unifying with the North, which is in dire financial straits, are estimated at between several hundred billion dollars and a few trillion, depending on the method of calculation. But all estimates suggest that reunification by absorption would greatly damage South Korea's rebounding economy and would pose a far heavier financial burden than the one West Germany bore from its union with East Germany in 1990.</p>
        <p>Mr. Park, one of the main negotiators behind this month's Korean summit meeting, said that there would be no quick reconciliation on the Korean peninsula and that the heavily fortified border dividing North and South would not suddenly come crashing down. On the contrary, the minister said, North and South Korea would proceed very slowly, taking a series of measured steps in the coming months and perhaps years to break down the ideological and economic barriers that have divided them for more than a half century.</p>
        <p>Reducing military tensions, rebuilding the North's shattered economy and increasing cultural ties are chief among the measures.</p>
        <p>Through these efforts, Mr. Park said, Koreans from the North and South, who have long been socialized to regard each other as enemies, would begin to view themselves as one people, setting the stage for a formal union.</p>
        <p>But unforeseen events in North Korea could spoil South Korea's plans for an orderly reconciliation.  Little is known about the true state of affairs in North Korea. There appears to be no meaningful political opposition to the Stalinist regime of leader Kim Jong Il, who has kept his deeply impoverished country in a state of physical and ideological isolation. But selected members of the Communist elite have been allowed  narrow windows on the outside world, and there is no saying what effect even gradual contact with South Korea would have.</p>
        <p>Mr. Park said it was still too early to say exactly what type of political system a united Korean peninsula could have, and nearly impossible to set a timetable for reunification. Considering the political strength of both governments, Mr. Park talked of the possibility of what he called a ''co-federation.''</p>
        <p>If relations between the two Koreas advance, some senior government officials envision a day when Koreans would travel freely between the two countries, the North's factories, now idle, would manufacture consumer electronics and other products for South Korean conglomerates, and Korea would send a unified team to the Olympics.</p>
        <p>But the officials acknowledged that much work lies ahead. They said they had not anticipated the overwhelming success of the meeting.</p>
        <p>Some critics of the agreement struck between President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and the North Korean leader have said that it is very short on substance.</p>
        <p>''To achieve a peaceful coexistence on the Korean peninsula, we must link aid and economic development with North Korea's military and political issues,'' said Kim Young Ho, a professor of political science at Sungshin Women's University in Seoul. ''And so far Kim Dae Jung's government has not done that. Just pouring money into North Korea accomplishes nothing, because Kim Jung II will readily accept it and put it to good use.''</p>
        <p>Still, South Korean officials said  they are well on their way to realizing one of their first goals: reducing tension on the peninsula. Already, both North and South have stopped their propaganda broadcasts in the demilitarized zone and no longer refer to each another in disparaging terms. And planning is already under way for a wide variety of cultural exchanges in sports, the arts, religion, and journalism.</p>
        <p>The South Korean government is also encouraging South Korean and foreign companies to form consortiums to develop North Korea's infrastructure.</p>
        <p>During the summit meeting, officials said, the Korean leaders discussed using some of the more than one million North and South Korean troops stationed in the demilitarized zone to finish building the remaining 10 miles of railway that would connect the entire peninsula through the border.</p>
        <p>''Kim Jong Il realizes that it's better to use the soldiers for peaceful purposes rather than having them staring at each other all day and building up hostilities,'' Mr. Park said.</p>
