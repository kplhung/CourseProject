        <p>Rosemary Connors letter on Greil Marcus's June 18 article praises courage of musicians like Sleater-Kinney and Bruce Springsteen (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read Greil Marcus's article about Sleater-Kinney [''Raising the Stakes in Punk Rock,'' June 18] the morning after I saw Bruce Springsteen at Madison Square Garden, in the midst of his ''American Skin''/ ''41 shots'' controversy. Thank God that musicians like Springsteen and the members of Sleater-Kinney understand their own gifts, and act on their right -- their responsibility -- to take to heart the old ''myth'' as defined in the quotation from Stanley Booth: ''that music had the power to change people's lives.'' There's a place in the world for all the Britneys and Eminems, but I think there is a special corner of heaven for Bruce, Sleater-Kinney and all those musicians who have the courage of their convictions, and use their talent for weaving insight and melody into songs that shed some light into what's going on in the world around us.</p>
