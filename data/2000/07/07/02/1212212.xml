        <p>THERE are many definitions of mixed feelings. Frank Effinger has come up with his own: it's when you give up a great job for a dream job.</p>
        <p>Until he cleaned out his desk at the Rye Country Day School last month, Mr. Effinger had been the school's hockey and lacrosse coach, with more than 200 victories in each sport and never a losing season in either. ''A living legend here,'' the school's headmaster, Scott Nelson, said. Now Mr. Effinger, 47, is the head Eastern scout for the Minnesota Wild, an expansion team that will enter the National Hockey League in September.</p>

        <p>THERE are many definitions of mixed feelings. Frank Effinger has come up with his own: it's when you give up a great job for a dream job.</p>
        <p>Until he cleaned out his desk at the Rye Country Day School last month, Mr. Effinger had been the school's hockey and lacrosse coach, with more than 200 victories in each sport and never a losing season in either. ''A living legend here,'' the school's headmaster, Scott Nelson, said. Now Mr. Effinger, 47, is the head Eastern scout for the Minnesota Wild, an expansion team that will enter the National Hockey League in September.</p>
        <p>''I have mixed feelings,'' Mr. Effinger, a Larchmont resident, said while packing up his office. ''After a great 26 years, I'm going to miss a lot of things. I've gotten to know some great kids here.</p>
        <p>''But I'm excited at the opportunity to work at the highest level of professional hockey. Very few Americans do this.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, at the nonplaying levels, professional hockey is still very much a Canadian monopoly. But Mr. Effinger had done part-time N.H.L. scouting for three years -- first with San Jose and the last two years for Buffalo -- and his perceptiveness and insight had been noted.</p>
        <p>Doug Riseborough, the general manager of the new Minnesota team, said: ''I kept hearing from people that Buffalo has a real good guy who works out of New York. I heard it too many times not to meet him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Effinger said: ''It was last October.  We met at the Starbucks opposite Madison Square Garden. We talked philosophy, players, what to look for in a game and a player and where the sport was going.</p>
        <p>''Two days later, he called me with a job offer. I told him that, No. 1, I wanted to be in his organization, but, No. 2, I was committed to the school for the school year. I wasn't going to leave it or the kids hanging. That's the way I've always been.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Riseborough, a former New York Rangers player, appreciated the loyalty and accepted the delay, even though he needed as much advice as he could get before stocking his first-year team. ''This was a good guy and a good fit,'' he said. ''so we were willing to wait.''</p>
        <p>The Wild are getting far more than just loyalty, Mr. Nelson said. ''What distinguishes Frank is a knowledge of the game, of both games,'' he said. ''I'm glad I never had to coach against Frank.''</p>
        <p>Playing for him is another matter.</p>
        <p>''We have alumni,'' Mr. Nelson said, ''who come back to see Frank every year, a real tribute to how he has touched their lives. Frank and his late wife, Maria, were very influential with how they supported our kids.''</p>
        <p>Maria Effinger died of bone cancer in 1997. ''She and Frank were fellow parents to our boys,'' Debbie Campbell of Larchmont said. Her two sons, Peter and Matt, were standout goalies in lacrosse.</p>
        <p>''Frank had hundreds of kids,'' Mrs. Campbell continued. If a player got injured, he'd call that night and ask, 'How's our boy?' ''</p>
        <p>Then there was the coaching acumen. At Rye Country Day School, his hockey teams won 234 games, lost 100 and tied 20; in lacrosse, the record was 212 to 84. And he is in the Iona College hall of fame for compiling a 187-66-3 hockey record with three conference championships earlier.</p>
        <p>''He honestly is a hockey genius,'' a defenseman, Larry Kosilla, who will skate for Army next year, said.  ''We're a high school team, and we're playing N.H.L. traps. He's just a great teacher.</p>
        <p>''If we're losing, he'll pull out his notepad in the huddle. Whatever he writes on that notepad, it works. Always.  His hockey sense is tremendous.''</p>
        <p>Now he will be applying it at the sport's highest level.</p>
        <p>''It's a dream job,'' Mr. Effinger said. ''I'll travel a lot, but my main responsibility is the East, and it's a great location with the Devils, Flyers and Rangers nearby and an American Hockey League team in Hartford.</p>
        <p>''Imagine, getting paid to watch hockey games!''</p>
        <p>Recently, the local hockey community said goodbye at a roast for Mr. Effinger.</p>
        <p>''Everybody had a great time,'' Mr. Effinger said. ''There was even a table of high school referees there. I think they were the happiest to see me go.''</p>
        <p>FOR THE RECORD</p>
