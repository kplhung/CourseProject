        <p>BERLIN IN LIGHTS</p>
        <p>The Diaries of Count Harry Kessler. (1918-1937).</p>

        <p>It is Dec. 28, 1918, just over a month since German capitulation and the end of fighting in World War I. Kaiser Wilhelm II has abdicated and fled to the Netherlands. In Kiel the German Navy mutinies, and the black, red and gold flag of the republic flutters over the Reichstag. Karl Liebknecht calls for a socialist revolution. Before lunch, Count Harry Kessler goes to visit the Imperial Palace, and there, among the shattered glass, looted furniture and broken walking sticks, the tawdriness of the atmosphere out of which war had come weighs on him: ''In this rubbishy, trivial, unreal microcosm, furnished with nothing but false values which deceived him and others, he made his judgments, plans and decisions. Morbid taste and a pathologically excitable character in charge of an all too well-oiled machine of state. Now the symbols of his futile animating spirit lie strewn around here in the shape of doltish odds and ends. I feel no sympathy, only aversion and complicity when I reflect that this world was not done away with long ago.''</p>
        <p>Bad aesthetics, bad ethics. Kessler's verdict on the Kaiser takes a leaf from the book of his contemporary, the great Viennese satirist Karl Kraus, who, at the end of his colossal montage drama ''The Last Days of Mankind,'' had no less a character than God echo the Kaiser's famous statement: ''This was not my will.'' The higher you stand, the less pardon for not knowing what you're doing. Kessler's critical sense was sharpened by two things: he was by birth a member of this old order. Not only that, but his mother, a famous beauty, was reputed to have been the old Kaiser's last mistress, and wags even had it that Kessler was cousin to Wilhelm II. He wasn't, but it gives his judgment a certain piquancy, and we are left to read between the lines of his diary what the upper class thought of his allegiance to the Weimar Republic. He reports Richard Strauss's wife, Pauline, accusing him, in 1926, of being a class traitor. He says she ''bends forward to whisper it stealthily, that Count Kessler has become quite a Red. Oh no, I answer, I am just a simple democrat. Pauline: A democrat, you, who are a count? In that case you are fouling your own nest.''</p>
        <p>Kessler was never simple. Transfer of power is accepted more in the spirit of a disillusioned conservativism rather than out of any conviction for egalitarian virtues. ''This is the age of little men,'' he confides, in a passage in which he extols his ''submarine sailor friend,'' one of those rugged working-class types who+attracted Auden and Isherwood in 1930: like many of his class, he idealizes the worker while scorning the pretensions of his bourgeois Social Democrat colleagues. Hitler, for example, is clearly a little man, a subaltern grotesquely empowered by the chaos of the times.</p>
        <p>How can we account for Kessler's commitment? He is an aesthete; he would seem a perfect candidate for the circle of ascetic, often homosexual acolytes around his exact contemporary, the poet Stefan George, who made out of the slogan ''art for art's sake'' a code for living. In such politicized times, it was a painfully inadequate pose. Before 1914, the orchid in the buttonhole of many German writers effortlessly became a badge for jingoism and war fervor; after 1918, retreat into the ivory tower and disdain for the ''little men'' played straight into the Nazis' hands. Kessler knew that without social democracy there would be no democracy at all.</p>
        <p>This new edition of Kessler's diary, ''Berlin in Lights,'' is edited by Charles Kessler, who is no relative of Harry's. The editorial notes, and the otherwise excellent introduction by Ian Buruma, divulge little about Kessler's youth. Born in 1868 to a German banker and an artistic Irish mother, he trained as a lawyer before devoting his energies and money to the arts. He introduced Impressionism to Germany, supported poets and artists (including Rilke and Munch), developed the Weimar seminars later to become the Bauhaus, and under his own imprint, the Cranach Press, produced classic fine books. He briefly served as a reserve officer in the early months of the war, worked as a cultural attache in Bern and was the first German diplomat in Warsaw after cessation of hostilities. Until 1924, he was constantly on the move across Europe, arranging new terms for the payment of German war reparations, observing the confusion after the imposition of the Versailles Treaty. In Germany it was an age of assassinations; Kessler was probably lucky not to have been shot himself. When Walter Rathenau, whose biography he later wrote, was murdered by right-wingers in June 1922, Kessler notes that more than 500 left-wing politicians had been killed since war's end.</p>
        <p>The title of this book, first issued in London in a marvelously fluent translation nearly 30 years ago, is misleading. It comes from a squib of verse by Kurt Weill, and was presumably meant to lend the book a sheen of cabaret naughtiness. Apart from the odd passing mention of ''voluptuaries'' and all-night bars in Berlin, Kessler is remarkably chaste about Babylon-on-the-Spree. His is really an account of the early days of that chimera, the United States of Europe -- single currency and customs union and all -- reminding us that it was on diplomats' lips long before the moral disaster that is conventionally thought to be its raison d'tre. Then as now, it was primarily a French-German affair. Kessler's cultured Europe is a lost continent though. Despite the craze in the 20's for all things American, it is evident from his descriptions that Paris and Berlin were still dazzled by their own weltglanz. It is hard to imagine French audiences today flocking to view a German film (''M</p>
        <p>What distinguishes his diary (apparently begun in 1880, making this book merely its latter third), is Kessler's distanziert tone -- its elegance, precision and shrewdness. The man who brought his gifts of mind to bear on the tragic carnival of his era was a distinguished prose writer. Many of his entries have an aphoristic force: ''All education is violence, just as every state is.'' About the private man we learn almost nothing, other than the names of obscure high-society friends. He is a Proust with a social conscience, forthright about his dislikes: Ernst Toller's play ''Die Maschinenstrmer'' is ''untalented rubbish,'' the poet Else Lasker-Schler ''this beastly person.'' At first hand he witnesses George Grosz's attempts to become the German Hogarth, noting that ''he is reactionary and revolutionary in one, a symbol of the times.'' He supplies a story to Hugo von Hofmannsthal, who works it up into ''Der Rosenkavalier.''</p>
        <p>Repeated visits to the Nietzsche Archive in Weimar, which he supported financially in its early days, convince him that Nietzsche's infamous sister is ''a flapper at heart.'' She in turn insists on calling him her ''oldest friend,'' even though he ridicules her right-wing leanings and the pontificating Oswald Spengler she invites to speak at the 1927 Nietzsche Congress. (Soon self-appointed ''supermen'' will be inviting themselves.) He meets Cocteau, Busoni, Einstein, the Woolfs; visits the Cadbury factory at Bourneville; and hears a 13-year-old Yehudi Menuhin play a recital. At a dinner party he watches Josephine Baker dance naked except for a pink apron, and coolly notes: ''A bewitching creature, but almost quite unerotic.'' Hitler appears in 1923, and looms larger as the diary enters Auden's ''low dishonest decade.'' In 1933 this secretary to his times leaves Germany, never to return.</p>
        <p>Many comments are eerily undeceived. I wonder if he ever reread his blatant entry for Saturday, Jan. 10, 1920: ''Today the Peace Treaty was ratified at Paris; the War is over. A terrible era begins for Europe, like the gathering of clouds before a storm, and it will end in an explosion probably still more terrible than that of the World War.'' In other words, war was anything but over. This is a man who has seen and understood a world on the way down before he has lived it. Purgatory for Kessler ended in 1937, when he died in France. And then the storm came. What does the diary leave us? His faith certainly, and a style.</p>
