        <p>PAST TIME</p>
        <p>Baseball as History.</p>
        <p>By Jules Tygiel.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 258 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Oxford University Press. $25.</p>
        <p>GAMES resist change; they incline to the timeless. So, inevitably, the histories written about them deal with the evolution of the society around them, not their own transformations. If a baseball fan from 1900 rode a time machine to this year's opening game, there would have been very little about the sport new to him: nine players, nine innings, three strikes, three outs, 90 feet between the bases, hits, errors, bases on balls -- most of the terms would be familiar. The uniforms would look slightly different, the blare from the sound system would be disconcerting and the players' salaries incomprehensible. Black, Hispanic and Asian players would be a novelty, too. But these changes are technological, social, economic -- not the game's. This is the history that Jules Tygiel tells in this extraordinary collection of essays, which, the author says, is a history not of baseball but of American culture as seen through the sport's interaction with developments in the social, political, financial and intellectual evolution of the United States.</p>
        <p>''Past Time'' is concerned with ''how each generation reinvented the national pastime to fit its own material reality and ideological perceptions,'' but this is no plodding, would-be Marxist analysis of baseball. Tygiel's forte as a historian is his eye for what may appear nugatory or marginal but, when focused upon, illuminates the temper of a given moment. His nine essays concern turning points in baseball and American history, arranged in chronological order. They cover the rise of the game from the mid-19th century to the present, and while each chapter is an individual unit, the book leaves one with the feeling of having read a complete history of American baseball. Tygiel's heroes are large and small, and their accomplishments range from the invention of the box score to that of rotisserie baseball.</p>
        <p>Tygiel, a professor of history at San Francisco State University and the author of ''Baseball's Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and His Legacy,'' places the sport in broad yet precise cultural contexts. He argues convincingly, for instance, that baseball became a national game because improvements in transportation and communication (railroads, the telegraph) unified the United States in the aftermath of the Civil War. Baseball became a symbol of that reunification. Tygiel also argues that the development of the social sciences and of statistics in the mid-19th century led Henry Chadwick to invent the box score and to establish methods to calculate and keep baseball records. Tygiel points out that Branch Rickey's creation of the farm system in the 1930's is coeval with the emergence of the first chain stores, which contributed to the creation of a national culture by making small towns feel they were part of a larger whole. While it is not particularly original to remark that Babe Ruth came onto the scene at the same time as radio broadcasting and the movies, Tygiel goes further by allowing that Ruth was also instrumental in the advance of public relations and advertising as businesses. He was among the first celebrities produced by those industries.</p>
        <p>Tygiel's best essay traces the interlaced, contrasting -- and clashing -- careers of Branch Rickey and Larry MacPhail. The lives of these two moguls coil around the history of 20th-century American baseball like two snakes clasped in mortal strife. Rickey, the sanctimonious, hypocritical puritan who kept track of attendance from his home on Sundays while piously refusing to go to the ballpark; MacPhail, the crass entrepreneur with vision, able to discern the potential profit of night baseball, television and aviation -- these former associates who became bitter rivals wound up in New York leading the two top teams: Rickey the Brooklyn Dodgers, MacPhail the Yankees. Inspired by greed and his much-proclaimed principles, Rickey was willing to bring about the racial integration of the game -- his specialty was the exploitation of labor, and black players, owned by weak Negro leagues teams, were a free market. MacPhail thought that large numbers of black fans at the stadiums would diminish the value of major league franchises. Like many owners, he rented ballparks to Negro leagues teams, and saw clearly that the integration of the majors would destroy his tenants, putting an end to that lucrative sideline. Rickey and MacPhail had contrasting mixtures of vision, chicanery, ambition and the will to win. Rickey, the former catcher, was obsessed with training techniques to squeeze the most out of his players; MacPhail, more forward-looking, was obsessed with business innovations that could renew the industry. Tygiel's strength in this superb essay is his affection for these flawed figures.</p>
        <p>Some of Tygiel's best and most revealing stories are about forgotten innovators. Thus we discover that Ben Shibe (after whom a park in Philadelphia was named) ''made his fortune by perfecting the machines that produced standardized baseballs.'' It was Harold Arlin, from Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, who first broadcast a baseball game, on Aug. 5, 1921. A fascinating unsung hero is the prescient Allan Roth, who, as a hobby, began in the 1940's to compile ''the most detailed analysis of baseball ever undertaken.'' Roth could cite hitters' averages against individual pitchers and what they did when ahead or behind in the count -- commonplace today but revolutionary then. Rickey, always fascinated by the scientific approach to the game, hired him. Tygiel recounts the dramatic moment when the Dodger publicist Irving Rudd, seeing Ralph Branca coming in to pitch to Bobby Thomson on that fateful Oct. 3, 1951, asked Roth how the right-hander fared against the Giant third baseman: ''Roth, staring out at the field, just shook his head sadly.''</p>
        <p>''Past Time'' is not a paean to baseball, but it is not a destructive critique either. On the issue of racial integration, for instance, Tygiel writes, the end of segregation meant that ''fewer, rather than more, African-Americans would earn their living from baseball in the latter half of the 20th century. The failure of major league teams to hire black managers, coaches and front-office personnel compounded this problem. The nearly universal celebration of Jackie Robinson's triumph notwithstanding, integration would produce negative as well as positive consequences.'' Tygiel notes that in 1951, four years after Robinson joined the Dodgers, ''only three teams in each league fielded black players.'' (Also by then, the Negro leagues were in sharp decline and midcareer players were scrambling for jobs.)</p>
        <p>Mythmaking is, of course, part of the history of baseball, a story unto itself that someone ought to write. The urge to play cannot be explained by material need; it emerges either before or after it. Myths wanting to account for the origin of this urge cannot reach it -- not even a modern one like cultural history. Tygiel is aware of this and refrains from making overambitious claims. But he also engages occasionally in mythmaking of his own and is blind to the influence the game itself has on the business of baseball. A leitmotif in ''Past Time'' is the slow pace at which the baseball industry adapts to change. Could this not be a reflection of the game's inherent resistance to innovation? I do not see slowness in a negative light, perhaps because I am, like everybody else, a potential mythmaker myself.</p>
        <p>But I fear that the consolidation of the two major leagues and the investiture of limitless power on a commissioner (who is, after all, one of the owners) could mean an unchecked rush to alter the game. In my nightmares I see the World Series in neutral, warm-weather sites, with teams not representing cities but only themselves as brand names. As with the new retro parks, nostalgia will just be another commodity, and the rules may even be tampered with, as in basketball, to generate excitement and greater revenue. Three sets of three innings, with the winner of two declared the victor, to create more endgame situations? Sudden death, as in other sports, by starting all extra innings with two outs and the bases loaded? Could something like this really happen? Tygiel is optimistic that it will not: ''Despite the perennial warnings of baseball Cassandras, time has yet to pass baseball by. What remains to be seen is not whether the game will survive, but how Americans in a rapidly changing world will again reinterpret and reinvent their national pastime.'' I hope that, being right about so much in the game's past, Tygiel is also good at predicting its future.</p>
