        <p>Letter from Mary-Powell Thomas comments on William Safire's June 26 Op-Ed column about retirement age</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Grab That Third Rail'' (column, June 26), William Safire points out that as we've gotten older, the retirement age has unfortunately remained the same. He suggests that businesses create ''plans to better utilize older workers.''</p>
        <p>Any such plans should include ways to ease the time burden on younger workers. People often work 40 to 80 hours a week when they are young -- even if they're raising children -- and then zero hours after 65.</p>

        <p>A survey in California found that 80 percent of respondents would like to see those hours redistributed, so they could have more leisure in their middle years. Perhaps Mr. Safire's proposed government incentives could include inducing companies to hire more workers for fewer hours, giving us all a better quality of life throughout our lives.</p>
