        <p>1. The young German photographer Burkhard Schittny is inspired by Egon Schiele's ''fascinating bodywork, the movement, the expressions on the faces, the very thin, angular, undernourished bodies.'' Schittny creates his technofusion of art and fashion by reworking his transparencies on the computer, using Photoshop to add outlines, erase parts of the picture and heighten color in the manner of a Schiele drawing. And if you think Schiele is a stretch as a style icon, get this: Schittny also shoots fashion images inspired by Francis Bacon.  2. Schiele at one time did fashion sketches himself and preferred to wear clothes of his own design. The black pants, white shirts and ties he wears in photographs and the suits, coats, tweeds and textures worn by his male sitters fit with fall's emphasis on classics, like this cotton-blend shirt, $370, vest, $290, and wool-blend pants, $530, all by Jil Sander. At Bergdorf Goodman.</p>

        <p>1. The young German photographer Burkhard Schittny is inspired by Egon Schiele's ''fascinating bodywork, the movement, the expressions on the faces, the very thin, angular, undernourished bodies.'' Schittny creates his technofusion of art and fashion by reworking his transparencies on the computer, using Photoshop to add outlines, erase parts of the picture and heighten color in the manner of a Schiele drawing. And if you think Schiele is a stretch as a style icon, get this: Schittny also shoots fashion images inspired by Francis Bacon.  2. Schiele at one time did fashion sketches himself and preferred to wear clothes of his own design. The black pants, white shirts and ties he wears in photographs and the suits, coats, tweeds and textures worn by his male sitters fit with fall's emphasis on classics, like this cotton-blend shirt, $370, vest, $290, and wool-blend pants, $530, all by Jil Sander. At Bergdorf Goodman.</p>
        <p>3. Not to be outdone by his fashion colleagues, John Galliano cited Schiele as a reference for the headline-grabbing ''hobo'' couture show he staged for Dior in January. ''Schiele has been a constant inspiration since my days as a student,'' the designer says. ''There is a beauty in both the psychological aspect and in the color and line of his work.'' Fashionable Schiele collectors include Ronald Lauder, chairman of the Museum of Modern Art and scion of the cosmetics clan, and Silvia Venturini, the Fendi family member responsible for designing the infamous Baguette.  4. Schittny sifted through scores of ''California dream boys'' before picking out Scott Barnhill and Jeremy Hassol, a newcomer recently spotted in Central Park, for this article. To recreate Schiele's unruly prepunk hairstyle, Karlo, our groomer, used Ariland's Hairgum in extra fort on Jeremy. Pomade, $5.99, and stick, $7.99, both at Ricky's.  5. And if you've got it -- or rather, if you've got less of it -- flaunt it. Helmut Lang's semi-sheer silk gauze shirts for fall in black, gray and cream are perfect for displaying a pancake stomach and the type of protruding ribs found in Schiele's self-portraits. Just don't go catching Spanish influenza. Shirt, $320. At Helmut Lang, 80 Greene Street.  6. The Schiele look calls for a classic shoe or boot, like the ones offered by A. Testoni, Jimmy Choo, Tim Little, Santoni or John Lobb. (Pictured here, Lobb's Appleford boot, about $740.) If you really want to go the distance, the new John Lobb boutique at 680 Madison Avenue also offers a custom shoe service. Three times a year, Alain Sarazin, a last maker, comes to town to take measurements and presents you with the finished product eight months later. Prices are $3,000 for shoes, $4,000 for ankle boots.  7. Schiele's erotic drawings of under-age girls scandalized his fellow Austrians -- and he is still causing a flap. ''Portrait of Wally,'' a painting of Schiele's mistress from the Modern's 1997 exhibition ''Egon Schiele: The Leopold Collection,'' is languishing in the museum's vaults after a family came forward charging that the Nazis had confiscated the painting from them. Its ownership is now under investigation by the U.S. Attorney's office. For latter-day enthusiasts, Schiele drawings are, surprisingly enough, still available -- even affordable. According to Jane Kallir of Galerie St. Etienne in Manhattan, which specializes in German and Austrian Expressionist art: ''Schiele was amazingly prolific in his short life. He left some 3,000 works on paper.'' You can buy a drawing without color for $50,000 to $60,000 and an original print for $3,000 to 6,000.</p>
