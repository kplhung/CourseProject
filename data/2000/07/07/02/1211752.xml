        <p>Dr. Kalliopi Nikolopoulou and Edward Weare Batchelder are to be married today in Monemvasia, Greece. The Rev. Stavros Angelakos is to perform the ceremony at the Greek Orthodox Church of Panagia Chrysafitissa.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nikolopoulou, 33, is keeping her name. Next month, she is to become the Andrew W. Mellon assistant professor of comparative literature at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. She graduated from Hobart and William Smith Colleges and received a doctorate in comparative literature from the University of Rochester.</p>
        <p>She is the daughter of Eleni Kosmidou of Thessaloniki, Greece, where she retired as a nurse practitioner at the Agios Demetrios Hospital.</p>
        <p>Mr. Batchelder, 44, is the special projects editor for Lingua Franca, a magazine in New York, and also writes about music for other magazines. He graduated from Harvard University and received a master's degree in German and comparative literature from the University of Rochester. His previous marriage ended in divorce.</p>
        <p>He is a son of Nathaniel Horton Batchelder Jr. of Barnstable, Mass., and the late Elizabeth Burnquist Batchelder. They retired from the Casady School in Oklahoma City, where his father taught English and his mother taught Greek mythology and English composition.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom's grandmother Evelyn Beatrice Longman Batchelder was the sculptor who designed ''Golden Boy,'' the Apollo-like statue that stood in the lobby of the AT&amp;T Building in New York and is now on the grounds of the company's headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J.</p>
