        <p>COLORFUL model engines like those shown here chug up rocky, wooded hillsides and wind among miniature evergreens and bright summer flowers in the Everett Children's Adventure Garden at the New York Botanical Garden. The Summer Train Show opened yesterday and will roll through the garden until Sept. 10. The trains pass intricate replicas of the homes of some of America's beloved storytellers and artists. The replicas are made of all natural materials and include Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House on the Prairie, the farmhouse from Grant Wood's ''American Gothic'' and Edgar Allan Poe's Bronx cottage. The Summer Train Show is the work of Paul Busse of Applied Imagination, who is also the designer of the garden's Holiday Train Show.</p>
