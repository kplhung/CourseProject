        <p>Fourth of July</p>
        <p>It would be hard to find an Independence Day celebration more Main Street, U.S.A. than the one staged every year at Mystic Seaport. The staff gets decked out in 19th-century Sunday best, Uncle Sam leads a parade through the grounds in his red, white and blue tails and top hat, and a roster of orators sound off on the significance of the day. The ceremonials are capped with the singing of ''America,'' the national anthem of the 1800's.</p>

        <p>Fourth of July</p>
        <p>It would be hard to find an Independence Day celebration more Main Street, U.S.A. than the one staged every year at Mystic Seaport. The staff gets decked out in 19th-century Sunday best, Uncle Sam leads a parade through the grounds in his red, white and blue tails and top hat, and a roster of orators sound off on the significance of the day. The ceremonials are capped with the singing of ''America,'' the national anthem of the 1800's.</p>
        <p>During the day, visitors are encouraged to join in games of croquet and children can compete in a spelling bee and spend some time in the Children's Museum and Discovery Barn. But holiday or no, the daily life of the 19th-century maritime village goes on uninterrupted with boat builders, carvers, weavers, iron forgers and barrel makers hard at work.</p>
        <p>Anchored in the Mystic River, three tall ships with colorful signal flags in their riggings may be boarded, including the Charles W. Morgan, the last wooden whaling ship afloat, seaport officials say. Small boats may be rented by the hour and the steamship Sabino makes regular trips on the river.</p>
        <p>Seaport hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily (it takes several hours to see and do even half of what is available) and there are snack bars and a full-service restaurant on the grounds. Admission is $16, $8 for children 6 through 12 and free for those under 6.</p>
        <p>The seaport is at 75 Greenmanville Avenue, Exit 90 from Interstate 95. The number to call for more information is (888) 9SEAPORT.</p>
        <p>Antiques on Parade</p>
        <p>Spread out on the long Madison green come Saturday from 9 to 4, rain or shine, will be the considerable contents of the North Madison Congregational Church's 27th Annual Antiques Show.</p>
        <p>In addition to the display of quality antique furniture, clocks, glass, dolls, china, silver, quilts, jewelry, carpets and collectibles, an antique and classic automobile show will be in progress. Refreshments will be supplied by the church bakery shop.</p>
        <p>Admission will be $3.50, free for children under 10 with an adult. Visitors might round out the day by picnicking and strolling the wooded paths and spacious beach of Hammonasset State Park.</p>
        <p>Cookout Time</p>
        <p>They call it Skitch's Beloved Barbecue -- a cookout to be savored each year around this time at the Silo in New Milford, an unusual culinary school, gourmet shop and art gallery founded and operated by Ruth and Skitch Henderson, the orchestra conductor. Part of the menu and an extra hand at the grill are supplied annually by Jim Dougherty, owner of The Egg and I Pork Farm.</p>
        <p>Together, these three create a feast of spit-roasted loin of pork, fire-baked stuffed apples, rosemary-grilled chicken, pineapple slaw, fresh  beets, skillet-fried potatoes and onions, and apricot bread pudding.</p>
        <p>It all takes place next Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. at The Silo, 44 Upland Road and the tab is $100, or $190 for two. The number to call for directions and reservations is (860) 355-0300.</p>
        <p>White Barn Gala</p>
        <p>Lucille Lortel's White Barn Theater and Museum in Westport celebrates it 53rd season this year, with an opening gala scheduled for next Sunday at 6 p.m. Ms. Lortel, one of the American theater's most devoted and generous producers, died last year.</p>
        <p>The opening will focus on the great dancers and choreographers of the 20th century who were associated with the White Barn at one time or another, including Geoffrey Holder, Carmen de Lavallade, Donna McKechnie, Jack Cole and Katherine Dunham. It will begin with a museum exhibition, followed by a stage presentation at 7 p.m. and ending with a champagne reception. Tickets are $100 of which $80 is tax deductible.</p>
        <p>The next production on July 14 through 16 is called ''The Abbott Touch,'' honoring George Abbott, the legendary Broadway producer of 140 shows. Songs and dances from some of them will include ''The Pajama Game,'' ''On Your Toes,'' ''Pal Joey'' and ''Damn Yankees.''</p>
        <p>The rest of the season promises to be gala all the way. Among the many treats are a musical evening with Bea Arthur, accompanied by Billy Goldenberg on July 21 through July 23. On Aug. 11 through Aug. 13 Salome Jens will portray Marlene Dietrich in a one-woman show titled ''Falling in Love Again.''</p>
        <p>On Aug. 25 through Aug. 27 June Havoc will star in the Vernon Duke-Howard Dietz musical ''Sadie Thompson,'' based on ''Rain,'' a Somerset Maugham story that was filmed twice, first with Greta Garbo, then with Joan Crawford.</p>
        <p>The season will end on Sept. 1 through Sept. 3 with Leslie Caron telling Colette's life story in the novelist's own words.</p>
        <p>Individual tickets are $27 and $30, series subscriptions are $176 and $200.</p>
        <p>Tickets and a complete schedule are available by calling (203) 227-3768. The theater is on Newtown Turnpike.</p>
        <p>Russian Writers</p>
        <p>''Pushkin to Nabokov: Russian Literature at Yale,'' an exhibition at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library through July 15, contains books collected by the university for more than a century.</p>
        <p>The most recent acquisition is the first edition of Pushkin's first work, ''Ruslan and Ludmila,'' published in 1820 in St. Petersburg. It came up for auction five days before this exhibition opened.</p>
        <p>Pushkin, considered to be the greatest Russian writer, and Nabokov, the greatest exiled Russian writer of the 20th century, became linked when Nabokov published a controversial English version of Pushkin's ''Eugene Onegin'' in 1964.</p>
        <p>Among the additional works in the exhibition are an 1897 edition of Chekhov's plays, Gogol's ''Dead Souls'' (1842), Turgenev's ''Fathers and Sons'' (1862), Dostoyevsky's ''Possessed'' (1873) and Tolstoy's ''Anna Karenina'' (1878).</p>
        <p>Twentieth-century writers include Boris Pasternak, who won the 1958 Nobel Prize for ''Doctor Zhivago;'' the poet Anna Akhmatova, the futurist Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1933.</p>
        <p>The library, at 121 Wall Street in New Haven, is open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., free of charge. The number to call for more information is (203) 432-2977.</p>
        <p>Rain's Significance</p>
        <p>Rain is often hard to come by in the Southwest, which may be why Native Americans in that region set such store by it, reflected symbolically in their art, music and customs.</p>
        <p>An exhibition on view through Sept. 4 at the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center focuses on ''Expressions of Rain in Native American Cultures,'' revealing more than most of us would see in the more than 100 objects displayed.</p>
        <p>The exhibition was organized by the Heard Museum in Phoenix and was seen at the British Museum in London. Traditional and contemporary art work was gathered by seven  curators who mined the artistic output of the Hopi, Navajo, Apache and Tohono O'odham tribes of Arizona and the Zuni and Rio Grande pueblos of New Mexico. The curators appear in a continuously running video explaining the importance of rain in their culture.</p>
        <p>Among the art and artifacts are kachina dolls, baskets, pottery, paintings, sculpture, textiles and jewelry that contain subtle and sometimes whimsical symbols of rain ranging from clouds to frogs to butterflies and rainbows.</p>
        <p>The museum is open daily from 10 a.m.to 7 p.m. Museum admission is $12, $10 for people 55 and older, $8 for children 6 through 15 and free for younger children. The number to call for more information is (800) 411-9671.</p>
