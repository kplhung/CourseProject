        <p>LISTEN up, class. We hate to spoil your holiday weekend, but an alarming new survey of American history knowledge  2/3-- released just days before Independence Day, no less 2/3 -- suggests that the nation is in desperate need of summer school. The report, sponsored by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, a Washington-based nonprofit group that promotes liberal-arts study, posed 34 high-school level questions randomly to 556 seniors at 55 leading colleges and universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Brown.</p>
        <p>Only one student answered all the questions correctly, and the average score was a sobering 53 percent -- even with a couple of gimmes about cartoon characters and rap stars tossed in. But maybe it's not too surprising: according to the survey, none of the schools examined require American history courses for graduation.</p>
