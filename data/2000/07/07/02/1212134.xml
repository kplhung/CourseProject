        <p>IT is both a Hollywood legend and a fact that the people who create glamorous films and television shows are often not especially glamorous. Take the case of Darren Star: the son of an orthodontist from Potomac, Md., a boy who used his bar mitzvah money to buy a subscription to Variety, a quiet, friendly and modest 38-year-old writer and producer who eschews fancy clothes, clubs and trappings and somehow seems unlikely to have been involved in the hugely successful and unmistakably flashy shows ''Beverly Hills 90210'' and ''Melrose Place,'' as well as HBO's acclaimed ''Sex and the City.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Star, who also helped create two new television shows for the fall, the WB network's ''Grosse Pointe'' and Fox's ''The Street,'' admitted that his shows are tinged with glamour and fantasy.

        <p>IT is both a Hollywood legend and a fact that the people who create glamorous films and television shows are often not especially glamorous. Take the case of Darren Star: the son of an orthodontist from Potomac, Md., a boy who used his bar mitzvah money to buy a subscription to Variety, a quiet, friendly and modest 38-year-old writer and producer who eschews fancy clothes, clubs and trappings and somehow seems unlikely to have been involved in the hugely successful and unmistakably flashy shows ''Beverly Hills 90210'' and ''Melrose Place,'' as well as HBO's acclaimed ''Sex and the City.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Star, who also helped create two new television shows for the fall, the WB network's ''Grosse Pointe'' and Fox's ''The Street,'' admitted that his shows are tinged with glamour and fantasy. ''I enjoy bringing a slightly larger-than-life quality to characters in fairly ordinary circumstances,'' he said while eating scrambled eggs in a Santa Monica hotel coffee shop overlooking the beach. ''There's a gloss that draws in audiences and allows me to tell the stories I want to tell.''</p>
        <p>He shrugged. ''It also happens to be the train I'm on,'' he said. ''And, for the moment, there's no reason to get off it.''</p>
        <p>Why should he? Mr. Star is not only one of the most successful writer-producers on television, but also one of the most prolific. By the fall season, he will have three shows on the air: ''Sex and the City,'' the hit comedy series that seeks to offer a candid view of sex and relationships among some (what else?) beautiful women in Manhattan; ''The Street,'' about successful and, yes, handsome young turks on Wall Street; and the suddenly controversial ''Grosse Pointe,'' which is Mr. Star's tongue-in-cheek look at a teen-age television soap opera that's very much like ''Beverly Hills 90210.'' The fact that the soap opera actors are not only depicted as shallow and silly but actually resemble some real-life counterparts has already stirred problems for Mr. Star.</p>
        <p>The powerful television producer Aaron Spelling, who has a complicated relationship with Mr. Star as both a mentor and a competitor, has complained that his daughter, Tori Spelling, is being lampooned on ''Grosse Pointe.'' Ms. Spelling was one of the stars of ''Beverly Hills 90210''; a ''Grosse Pointe'' character, Marcy Sternfeld, is an actress with family connections that got her a job on the fictional series. Mr. Star said that, under pressure from WB, he had changed the hair color of the actress, Lindsay Sloane, who plays Marcy Sternfeld, and deleted a scene in which the actress becomes sick because of an eating disorder.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Star said he has fought Mr. Spelling's efforts to influence the network, particularly in regard to the show's nepotism plot line. ''This is not Tori Spelling,'' Mr. Star insisted. ''I'm not out to hurt anyone's feelings. I've made some minor changes.'' But Mr. Star said that he would seriously object were the WB network to ask him for weekly changes in the character. Mr. Spelling did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Star has plainly made an effort to move beyond the teen and 20-something genre that, in many ways, he helped create. After moving to New York in 1995 -- he still has a home in the Hollywood Hills -- Mr. Star created ''Central Park West'' for CBS. The glitzy soap opera about rich and beautiful people in New York, which starred, among others, Mariel Hemingway, Raquel Welch, Ron Liebman and Lauren Hutton, flopped. Mr. Star said he believed the series failed because CBS, with its older audience, was the wrong network for a show initially designed for young professionals.</p>
        <p>''I was looking for a lover of one of the younger women on the show and I got this call from CBS saying that they really wanted Gerald McRaney, and I realized the show was really going to have to change,'' Mr. Star said. Mr. McRaney, in his 50's, had been the star of the CBS series ''Major Dad.''</p>
        <p>At that point Mr. Star optioned the book ''Sex and the City,'' by Candace Bushnell. ''I did this show because I was sick of network television,'' Mr. Star said. ''I did 'Melrose Place,' which had a huge audience but no respect. I wanted respect. I couldn't really tell stories in my voice. I couldn't really tell stories that I, myself, wanted to see. And I felt the idea of a comedy about sex was something I really wanted to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Star, who produces the show with Michael Patrick King, brushed aside the criticism that its sex-obsessed women are perhaps too one-dimensional and verge on caricature. '' 'Seinfeld' was sex-obsessed too -- that show wasn't about his job,'' Mr. Star said. ''Most shows about single guys are about sex too. The difference is we don't veil it under double-entendres here, because it's HBO.''</p>
        <p>Chris Albrecht, HBO's president of original programming, said that Mr. Star's success on television rested in part on his ability to deal with real issues: high-schoolers coping with teenage angst and sexuality (''Beverly Hills 90210''), young people struggling to forge careers (''Melrose Place'') and successful women in their 30's searching for happiness (''Sex and the City''). But Mr. Star then places his characters in a glamorous -- sometimes improbably glamorous -- setting.</p>
        <p>''You've got relatability and you've got fantasy, and this makes people want to watch these shows week after week,'' Mr. Albrecht said.</p>
        <p>Sandy Grushow, chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment Group, has known Mr. Star since the early days of ''Beverly Hills 90210.''  ''Darren has an uncanny ability to understand what the public wants,'' he said. ''He has his finger on the pulse of what's going on, what people are talking about. And he captures it and executes it brilliantly.''</p>
        <p>Sarah Jessica Parker, who plays the New York sex columnist who narrates ''Sex and the City,'' and is also a producer of the series, said that Mr. Star's writing was deceptive. ''It's often appropriately glib and surfacey, the characters are colorful, but then in the last three minutes he can turn the knife and kill you,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Often the shows end on an unexpectedly poignant or believable note, Ms. Parker said. As a result, she said, women relate to it and men are engaged by it. ''When I walk down the street what people most often say to me is, 'This is my life,' '' she said. ''They relate to the hunt, the journey, the disappointments, the hurts, the ridiculousness, the whims and the vulgarity of looking for love. It just resonates with people.''</p>
        <p>Apart from indulging his taste for fancy restaurants in New York and Los Angeles, Mr. Star, who is single, lives his life almost entirely around his work. Several years ago he met with Madonna to discuss a film project. ''She invited me to attend the Independent Film Awards in New York,'' he said. ''It was something I was excited to do. I'm a huge Madonna fan. But I was working. I showed up an hour late. She wasn't happy.''</p>
        <p>Growing up in Potomac, a suburb of Washington, Mr. Star was taking screenwriting courses at American University while still in high school. At the University of Southern California and U.C.L.A., he majored in creative writing. After graduation, he worked as a waiter at a Hamburger Hamlet and as an assistant to a publicist. At 24, he sold his first screenplay, ''Doin' Time on Planet Earth.'' The movie quickly disappeared.</p>
        <p>At the time, he was living in an apartment complex in West Hollywood (the inspiration for ''Melrose Place''), and his unproduced screenplays soon won him a reputation as someone who could write dialogue for teenagers.</p>
        <p>Barry Diller, then chairman of Fox, came up with the idea of a television series set in a high school. Mr. Spelling was brought in to produce, and Mr. Star, who was 28, was asked to write the pilot. The series began in the fall of 1990, and ended this May, after 10 years. Mr. Star's involvement with the show lasted five years.</p>
        <p>''Yes, the kids were beautiful and rich, for the most part, but that wasn't the reason for the success of the show,'' he said. ''It was about the power of friendship. And there was a universal appeal for that show, I think, because parents did not come in and solve their kids' problems, as in most shows about teenagers. This was a show in which kids solved their own problems. And that appealed to a lot of people because that's what adolescence is about.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Star said that although he is often offered movie jobs, the fast pace of television suits him better. And, he said, so does New York: ''L.A. was too insular for me, too myopic, and I really love New York. I'm doing the Wall Street show because I was surrounded by Wall Street culture. And even I, like everyone else, was starting to watch CNBC. And then I got a call from my broker in New York, a guy I had never actually met. And I met him for drinks. And I expected, like, my father to walk into the room. And this 26-year-old kid came in.</p>
        <p>''And I'm like, 'This is the guy I'm trusting all my money with?' It was scary. And then it got me thinking. I began thinking that this could make a very interesting show.''</p>
