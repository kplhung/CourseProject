        <p>Most lawyers might have been dragging if they had been handling the defense for either American General, accused of charging higher life insurance rates for blacks than for whites,  or Waste Management, accused of misleading investors about its projected earnings. Ralph C.  Ferrara, a partner at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, handled both. By mid-June, when the companies announced settlements of huge class action lawsuits a day apart, he was reeling.</p>
        <p>He had spent the final week on airplanes, shuttling among Washington (his home base as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission's), New York (negotiating with opposing lawyers on these and other cases) and Nashville (where the American General case was set). ''It was hell,'' Mr. Ferrara, 55, recalled. ''I was getting third-degree burns from my word processor, my ears will have a permanent buzz from the phones, and my pager was vibrating so much I think I'll need a hip replacement. When you're 35, you do this with elan, but at 55, it's a real push.''</p>

        <p>It was what has become a pretty standard week for him since 1995, when Congress passed a law that, by halting class action suits for securities law violations, prodded many lawyers to take up other class action complaints.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferrara, maintaining his priorities, still got back to Washington in time for his regular 50-mile weekend bicycle rides.</p>
