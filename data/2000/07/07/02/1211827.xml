        <p>Talk about shallow. Whether on an AstroTurf-covered terrace in Chelsea or in a freshly mown backyard in Westchester County, scenesters this summer are rolling up their capri pants and sipping their sea breezes standing in 10 inches of water. The inflatable kiddie pool, once reserved for Shirley Temple drinkers, is making a splash at grown-up cocktail parties, even among those who don't have a kiddie to go with their pool. Erik Hanson, a painter, gave a shin-soaking shindig last month at his Peekskill, N.Y., home for the opening of an exhibition he coordinated called -- no pun intended -- ''Floating Dialogues: Imagery and Abstraction'' at the Paramount Center for the Arts there. ''Some people didn't want to take their socks off at the party,'' he admitted. ''But with most people, once the ice was broken, a big smile came on their faces.'' Nancy Plominski, a guest at the party, said: ''It was perfect because my feet were killing me. I had on new shoes, and it was so hot that day.''</p>

        <p>The possibilities include a $49.95 10-foot ''family swim center'' by Intex from toysrus.com and a self-inflating fish-shaped pool from the makers of the AeroBed for $199.95 at Hammacher Schlemmer. The Pottery Barn Kids catalog offers two high-design pools for $59: one shaped like a sailboat (above), the other like a whale, which spouts water.</p>
