        <p>When Dave Lenovitz gets in the car and heads out to places like Detroit or Des Moines to scout about for surplus plates and bowls, his wife, Julie Gaines, continues with the work of running their store, Fishs Eddy. They opened a third Manhattan location June 15 at Mercer and Broome Streets in SoHo. (Their second store is at 77th Street and Broadway.)</p>
        <p>The dishes in the store are made of china for heavy-duty use in restaurants, clubs and dining halls. All are surplus or overstocked, and none are used, Ms. Gaines said. A 25-year-old celery dish from the Greenbrier Hotel costs $28 and a dinner plate from Trader Vic's restaurant is $48, while a USAir saucer is 95 cents. Dinner plates from Elmira College are $12 and plates from the International Monetary Fund $35.</p>

        <p>The new store, with 1,800 square feet on two levels, is slightly smaller than the original store at 889 Broadway (19th Street) which opened 12 years ago and is named after a town in Delaware County, N.Y., that the couple once visited. ''This one is a little more focused,'' Ms. Gaines said of the SoHo store, which devotes more space to the dishes and less to frills like dried roses, dish towels and T-shirts.</p>
