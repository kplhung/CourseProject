        <p>Whatever emotional problems Elian Gonzalez may develop later in life, he can never say he was unwanted as a child. For seven bizarre months, almost everyone seemed to want him -- on both sides of that odd political fault line off the tip of Florida.</p>
        <p>In the end, the courts had the last word. The Supreme Court chose not to hear the case, unable to find any grounds for an appeal. On news of the court's refusal to get involved, Elian and his entourage (how many 6-year-olds have entourages?) quickly headed back to a cheering welcome in Cuba.</p>
        <p>That ended the drama, perhaps, but the ripples still roll onto both shores. In Cuba, Fidel Castro got a definite jolt of revolutionary caffeine from the epic Battle for Elian, and now he wants to keep that energy humming in his unceasing campaign to end, or at least ease, the American trade embargo.</p>
        <p>And, after 38 long years, such a prospect suddenly seemed a shade more likely. The Cuban-Americans who take a hard line on Havana -- a group whose political heft vastly outweighs its numbers -- suddenly found itself on the defensive and reshuffled its leadership to present a new, younger face to Washington.</p>
        <p>It wasn't just Elian, of course. After the 1997 death of Jorge Mas Canosa, an anti-Castro dynamo who often seemed to dictate United States policy on Cuba, the exile lobby lost steam -- witness the accord in Congress on lifting the ban on sales of food and medicine to Cuba. Many in Little Havana got a temporary boost from having Elian around.</p>
