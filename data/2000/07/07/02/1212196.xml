        <p>The show, which consists of 30 works by nine local artists, contains more than a few surprises, most notably the work of Charles Augustus Smith.

        <p>FLORAL painting has long been one of the staples of representational art. Because of its decorative quality, many see this form as craft; some artists, however, have managed to add something extra to this oft-too-familiar genre. Examples of both kinds of botanical works can be viewed at the current exhibition at the Chappaqua Library Gallery here, titled ''From the Garden.''</p>
        <p>The show, which consists of 30 works by nine local artists, contains more than a few surprises, most notably the work of Charles Augustus Smith. Besides his commercial work, Mr. Smith also managed to produce a large number of curious fine-art paintings. His works from the 1940's, which mix the experimental approach of Max Ernst with the dreaminess of Odilon Redon's imagery, was inspired by the poetry of Emily Dickinson.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith's small ''Untitled'' (circa early 1940's) oil on Masonite, which is in a display case, shows a variety of techniques. Some of the details in this floral still life are created by leaf printing, paint scraping and scratching. A second work, ''My Nose Gave'' (circa early 1940's), at first glance looks like the ground cover of a dense forest. Upon closer inspection, a few puzzling little people begin to appear here and there. One imagines he began with layers of arbitrary, dark-colored paint applications to which, in response to the imprecise, abstracted shapes, he adds plants and people.</p>
        <p>Next to Mr. Smith's paintings are two additional treasures by the photographer Consuelo Kanaga. Despite the intimate size of these prints, Ms. Kanaga maximizes the power and scale of her subjects by editing or cropping. In ''Frances With a Flower'' (circa 1930's), Ms. Kanaga brings her camera lens close enough to see the texture of the sleeping woman's skin. The harsh sunlight, the sharply cast shadows and the oddly placed flower, which rests beneath the subject's nose, add to the tropical feel of the work. A second print, ''Camellia'' (1927-28), is also simple and profound. Again, because of Ms. Kanaga's cropping, the flower becomes monumental, and the stout glass that holds its water becomes a reservoir.</p>
        <p>Above these works hang two neo-post-Impressionist paintings by George Kelly; one wonders why the curator of the show, Larry D'Amico, included these two brash works when putting together such a display of discreet works. Joanne Oechsner's two paintings seem a little out of place in this exhibit, since they, too, are loosely painted.</p>
        <p>Conversely, Zelda Appleton's tunnel-vision color photographs bring the viewers' attention back to the sneaky details. Here, one imagines the artist spending hours on end, waiting for the precise moment when a combination of the simplest and most basic aspects of nature make magic, proving patience is a virtue.</p>
        <p>Ms. Appleton's ''Violet/Dewdrop'' (1995) shows at extremely close range the precise moment when a water droplet becomes perfectly round just before it falls. The tight depth of field, which allows only the highly reflective water droplets to be in focus, results in a wondrous view of one very compelling, albeit painfully simple, moment.</p>
        <p>Ms. Appleton achieves another alluring effect in ''Wake Robin'' (1995). Here she captures the soft, filtered light of the sun as it backlights a freshly opened flower. But the insect in ''Golden Eye Lacewing'' (1995) seems to be waiting for the photographer/ voyeur to say or do something.</p>
        <p>Susan Parslow uses the old technique of painting light oils or watercolors on a black-and-white print. ''Hydrangea'' (1999) delivers an otherworldly effect, as the artist combines the tinted purple and yellow flowers with the background of uncolored, curly top hydrangea. On the other hand, Cornelia Cotton's three color photographs, which have a nice, cozy quality, look a little too much like shots from an interior design or an architecture magazine.</p>
        <p>Corinne Lapin-Cohen's ''Passion Flower, Passiflora Caerulea'' (1998) has its flaws with regard to perspective; despite that, it is one of this exhibition's more unusual straight botanical-type paintings. In her watercolor, Ms. Lapin-Cohen enhances three important aspects of her subject: the ornamental detailing in the flowers, which alludes to attention-getting tactics; the warm-colored sweet fruit as the coveted, albeit fleeting prize; and the viney appendages that suggest self-loathing -- all alluding to passion's precarious, double-edged ramifications.</p>
        <p>Margaret Robinson's watercolor, titled ''Virginia Bluebells (Mertensia Virginica)'' (1996), is the most resolved Realist painting in the show. The way in which she captures the delicate, almost lighter-than-air, bell-shaped pink-and-blue flowers is candy for the eyes. To heighten the delicacy of the flowers, Ms. Robinson includes two almost imperceptible spots of decay on the leaves, which quietly add a hint of fragility.</p>
        <p>Eleanor B. Wunderlich's paintings are far more calculated with respect to design. For instance, in two of her four works she includes a painted border, which heightens the presence of the negative space. Gallery visitors might also take a moment to ponder the different shades of green in each of the various leaves she paints. This would help the nonpainter better understand just how important accurate color really is to the Realist artist.</p>
        <p>''From the Garden'' ends July 22. For more information, the number to call is (914) 238-4779.</p>
