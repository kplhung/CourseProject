        <p>WHEN I was a child in Manhattan, summer vacation signaled the start of hours spent playing inside air-conditioned apartments, leavened by forays to the Good Humor truck or to roller-skate around the block under the watchful eye of neighborhood doormen. These activities seemed very average to me, and I reserved my excitement for a pastime that represented the truly exotic: camping.</p>
        <p>The idea of sleeping under the stars -- even seeing the stars -- epitomized the sublime. I lay in my room at night pretending that the steady stream of cold air from the window unit was a breeze, and that the hum of traffic was the burble of a running brook.</p>

        <p>WHEN I was a child in Manhattan, summer vacation signaled the start of hours spent playing inside air-conditioned apartments, leavened by forays to the Good Humor truck or to roller-skate around the block under the watchful eye of neighborhood doormen. These activities seemed very average to me, and I reserved my excitement for a pastime that represented the truly exotic: camping.</p>
        <p>The idea of sleeping under the stars -- even seeing the stars -- epitomized the sublime. I lay in my room at night pretending that the steady stream of cold air from the window unit was a breeze, and that the hum of traffic was the burble of a running brook.</p>
        <p>Eventually, my father took me camping in the White Mountains in New Hampshire, where I discovered that along with the pleasant attributes of outdoor life -- the crackle of the fire, the sound of the wind in the trees, the piney smell of the campsite -- came some rather difficult logistics.</p>
        <p>Our tent was made of pale orange canvas, and its aluminum poles had to be put together piece by piece by piece -- an endless process. The tent pegs came in a tiny, moldering bag that reminded me of the pouches in which gold panners kept their meager finds. The tent was poorly ventilated and damp, and all night, no matter which way I turned in my soggy cloth sleeping bag, rocks and twigs jabbed at me. I forced myself to focus on the joy of setting marshmallows on fire.</p>
        <p>Still, I was an instant addict. In subsequent years, I pitched innumerable tents. At summer camp, I went on canoe trips, gleefully portaging a canoe with my fellow grimy bunkmates (this was a benefit of camping I hadn't foreseen: no showers!). I acquired my own canoe paddle and engaged in high-minded discussions about whether or not using soap in lakes would kill off the plant life. Even the trip on which I stepped on a fish hook (after being told repeatedly not to walk around barefoot) did not dampen my enthusiasm. I drank bug juice with pine pitch in it and ate scores of hot dogs.</p>
        <p>As I got older and busier, my desire to go camping waned. When I finally made plans to head into the woods again, last summer, it had been a dozen years since my last night of ghost-story terror intensified by strange rustlings in the underbrush. The occasion was a cross-country drive, on which my friend Noah and I planned to camp in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.</p>
        <p>Envisioning hot cocoa and reading by flashlight, I went in search of a tent -- and got something of a shock. Nagivating the outdoors first meant navigating the 21st century. The woods seemed very far away.</p>
        <p>Instead of heading out to Eastern Mountain Sports or leafing through the L. L. Bean catalog, as I might have done 10 or even 5 years ago, I went on the Internet. There, I discovered the Web site of Recreational Equipment Inc., the Seattle-based outdoor gear store. Then I found the link to the REI  Outlet Web site, (www.rei-outlet.com) designed for -- not to mention directed at -- people who want to prove, or perhaps improve, their physical prowess without paying retail or setting foot in a store.</p>
        <p>Within minutes, I had located the perfect  tent for the perfect price ($52.95). It was made of hunter green nylon, and had fiberglass poles, a window in the back, and a screen across the front flap. A nifty fly to ward off rain went over the top. I couldn't test the zippers or lie down in it, but one click and it was mine.</p>
        <p>Having made such short work of my task, I spent some time cruising through some of the unbelievable numbers of items offered on the site to see if there was anything I couldn't live without. Most of of it was stuff I'd never heard of.</p>
        <p>There were ''hydration backpacks,'' with tubes running from built-in reservoirs for easy drinking. There were no fewer than 30 styles of hiking shoes -- for day hikes, long hikes, winter hikes, summer hikes. There were Therm-a-Rest self-inflating mattresses in 10 styles. There were water filtration systems, gourmet cook sets, even a Java Press for brewing that perfect latte around the coals.</p>
        <p>While some of these improvements seemed eminently reasonable -- for example, making sleeping bags out of materials that do not absorb water -- a lot of it seemed excessive. Did I really need microfiber pants that convert into shorts for a three-night camping trip? Yet they were tempting.</p>
        <p>True, much of this stuff is meant for people who do things like hike the Appalachian Trail from North Carolina to New Hampshire. But marketing departments for these outfitters must figure that certain people will feel that even one night in the wild requires a headlamp and a two-way radio -- just in case someone gets lost looking for the water tap.</p>
        <p>I refrained, however. Luckily Noah was already the proud owner of a pair of Therm-a-Rests.</p>
        <p>When the great day finally arrived, we were traveling light. We pulled up to our campsite, pulled out our tent and prepared for battle. In my mind's eye, I had imagined us struggling with poles and confusion; in reality, we had the thing pitched in under five minutes.</p>
        <p>Having budgeted the hour or so left before dark for putting up the tent (not to mention arguing about it), I was unsure of what to do next. Then I realized it was time for the part of camping that was fun, which, thanks to the miracles of modern technology, had arrived early. I got a novel, put on a sweater, and promptly fell asleep on my air mattress.</p>
        <p>A FEW hours later, we started to get hungry, and the issue of collecting kindling for the fire arose (we had opted not to buy a gas camp stove, theorizing that these were for sissies). Who was going to go out there into the dark woods to look? And furthermore, had we remembered bug spray? In the end we both went, but some of the old ill will that I remembered so well from previous camping trips had begun to well up.</p>
        <p>I found this oddly comforting -- all the high-tech efficiency was getting on my nerves. Dinner, naturally, was franks and beans cooked to a slow scorch over the fire. We topped it off with s'mores and then it was time for bed. The trip to the wash house wasn't bad -- we walked along the path with a flashlight, banging the tin pot we'd cooked our dinner in against our knees, listening to the friendly chirping of birds and insects.</p>
        <p>Sometime in the creepy dark of early morning, I woke up and wanted to go to the bathroom. My left arm, which had been out of my sleeping bag, was freezing cold. It was pitch black. I heard noises outside and my mind immediately flicked to a helpful article I had scanned on the REI site, ''Reasons for Using Bear-Resistant Food Containers.'' Hadn't I seen some signs about bears on the way to the wash house earlier? Maybe it would be better just to try to go back to sleep.</p>
        <p>I looked over at my sleeping companion. Should I wake him and ask him to walk me to the bathroom, or was this too pathetic? Would he be angry? Worse, would he think less of me? My certainty that there were bears just outside the zippered front flap  grew with every passing second. Though I knew it was absurd, I was scared, not to mention uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>Then it hit me: Despite Web sites, fancy gear and halogen flashlights, camping was still camping. Certain things, after all, cannot be mitigated. I felt claustrophobic in my sleeping bag, and because we'd forgotten to zip that handy back window shut, my sneakers were squishy with dew.</p>
        <p>The tent was small and cramped, and blessedly, the outdoors, the unknowable world of stars and bears and strange noises in the night, was still great.</p>
