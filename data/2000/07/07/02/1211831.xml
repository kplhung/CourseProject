        <p>SO here we are in Dullsville, having a thrill a minute. Not because of the nightlife, or even the wildlife, but because we roared into this western Ohio hamlet in Chevrolet's fastest, most secret, most exciting production Corvette yet.</p>
        <p>Called the Z06, it has 385 horsepower -- 35 more than a standard 2001 'Vette -- and it is aimed head-on at weekend racers whose priorities are speed, speed and speed -- in that order. The car, with a price of $47,500, reaches dealerships this month and is likely to show up immediately in autocross competitions or at Corvette Club track events.</p>

        <p>SO here we are in Dullsville, having a thrill a minute. Not because of the nightlife, or even the wildlife, but because we roared into this western Ohio hamlet in Chevrolet's fastest, most secret, most exciting production Corvette yet.</p>
        <p>Called the Z06, it has 385 horsepower -- 35 more than a standard 2001 'Vette -- and it is aimed head-on at weekend racers whose priorities are speed, speed and speed -- in that order. The car, with a price of $47,500, reaches dealerships this month and is likely to show up immediately in autocross competitions or at Corvette Club track events.</p>
        <p>What Chevrolet has done is to rework its fixed-roof hardtop, which arrived as a 1999 model. Although the hardtop was already the stiffest, lightest and fastest Corvette, Chevy reached into its bag of tricks to create the Z06: The 5.7-liter V-8 engine was reworked to produce 385 horsepower, the suspension was revised and the unloaded weight was cut to 3,115 pounds -- almost 100 pounds lighter than the '01 coupe and convertible and 38 pounds lighter than the previous hardtop. That model will no longer exist other than as the Z06.</p>
        <p>Chevy engineers say the Z06 easily outperforms its coupe and convertible siblings, which will not be available with the new engine. It also handles better and will circle a track faster than the ''King of the Hill'' Corvette ZR-1 of 1990-95, said Dave Hill, chief Corvette engineer. Mr. Hill says the new car is capable of zero-to-60 sprints in 4 seconds and a quarter-mile run in 12.6 seconds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill says engineers found the Z06 would do laps at their test track 3 to 4 seconds faster than the 350-horsepower coupe.</p>
        <p>All that track talk is well and good, but how does the Z06 perform on the open road? Heading out of Cleveland, the driver's first impression is that this is definitely a harder-edged car. It's not a Corvette for everybody.</p>
        <p>The suspension is stiffer, with a larger, stronger front stabilizer bar. You feel everything the vehicle encounters on the road -- a tradeoff for the improved handling.</p>
        <p>Part of the gain in handling comes from wheels that are an inch wider than those on the standard Corvette, and although the tires are bigger, they are a total of 23.4 pounds lighter. That's because the Z06 does not use the run-flat tires found on other Corvettes. In case of a flat, the driver has Chevrolet's best wishes, a miniature air compressor and a repair kit that includes a squeeze bottle of sealant.</p>
        <p>The car is also noisier, partly because of a hatchback configuration that amplifies sound, and partly because its weight-loss regimen included thinner glass.</p>
        <p>On lightly traveled rural roads, the Z06's special nature is appreciated. The car changes direction quickly, and taking turn after turn at increasingly higher speeds can make the driver feel inadequate -- incapable of fully exploiting its grip.</p>
        <p>Plus, there is the revised V-8, called the LS6. Exclusive to the Z06, it is based on the regular 5.7-liter LS1 in regular Corvettes. Changes include improved breathing, thanks to a new titanium exhaust; unique to the Z06, it weighs almost 18 pounds less than a conventional exhaust system.</p>
        <p>The new engine reaches peak horsepower at 6,000 r.p.m. and peak torque (385 foot-pounds) at 4,800 r.p.m. That compares with 350 horsepower at 5,600 r.p.m. and 375 foot-pounds at 4,400 r.p.m. for the LS1.</p>
        <p>The LS6 is amazingly flexible, providing strong acceleration in almost any gear of the new six-speed manual transmission. Just pick a gear and let the engine do the rest. Shift if it pleases you. Don't if you feel lazy. And this engine can be a ridiculously relaxed cruiser. In sixth gear, at 90 m.p.h., it turns over only 2,300 times a minute.</p>
        <p>Subtle touches set the car apart from lesser 'Vettes: Z06 emblems on front fenders, light-gray wheels over red brake calipers, scoops that funnel air to the brakes, racier-looking instruments, a red engine cover. On a Saturday afteroon in Dull, about 100 miles southwest of Toledo, it didn't take the Z06 long to catch the eye of Bobbie Clark, who'd been mowing his lawn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark, a retired corrections officer, is responsible for signs around the hamlet, also known as Dull Station, like ''6 Houses Makes 1 Dull Town'' and ''Dull Station. Population 22, 6 Dogs and 10 Cats.'' He puts up the signs and spruces up the area, he said, because he appreciates its history.</p>
        <p>Chevy, likewise, has honored the Corvette's history by invoking the car's legendary first chief engineer, Zora Arkus-Duntov. In 1963, he created the first Z06 package, aimed at purists who wanted a 'Vette they could pick up at the dealership and take directly to the racetrack.</p>
        <p>But there are a few other places where a driver can judiciously put the car's capabilities to good use. The Z06 forces the driver to become a sneak thief -- grabbing some extra speed on an entrance or exit ramp or on an open stretch of road when no one's around -- and passing becomes an opportunity instead of an annoyance.</p>
        <p>Should enthusiasm overcome common sense, help is available. All 2001 Corvettes come with Chevrolet's second-generation active-handling system, which senses oversteer or understeer and makes adjustments to help bring the car back into balance. But the system has been reworked to be even less intrusive to an enthusiast driver, briefly reducing wheel spin without cutting engine power so much that the car bogs down.</p>
        <p>The system can even detect the difference between a skilled driver who is visually anticipating a slide and countersteering correctly, and a driver who is playing catch-up, said Mr. Hill, the engineer.</p>
        <p>This Corvette certainly doesn't suffer from any distractions. Rather, it is very focused -- aimed at the most serious Corvette enthusiasts, those who want the most when it comes to performance on the track or simple bragging rights.</p>
        <p>INSIDE TRACK: For drivers, no dull moments.</p>
