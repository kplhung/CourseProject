        <p>Angelo Cataldi insists he is still steamed about the day last August when he was ejected from the sands of Avalon for lack of a beach tag. In addition to talking about it on his sports-radio show in Philadelphia, he is fighting the conviction and challenging the beach-fee law in court.</p>
        <p>And last week he stood with an ally, Assemblyman Neil M. Cohen of Roselle, who each year renews his campaign to abolish beach fees altogether. At a news conference here, Mr. Cohen promised to make a nuisance of himself again this summer, with Mr. Cataldi's help.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cataldi, who as a morning-show host on WIP-AM has a bigger audience, has repeatedly beat up the Avalon beach patrol on the air. (Conversation on the sports station, which The Philadelphia Inquirer has called the antidote to National Public Radio, often wanders off subject.)</p>
        <p>''This is a nightmare for me,'' Mr. Cataldi, his jacket studded with beach tags, said at the news conference. ''I hate lawyers and I hate politicians. I'm a goofball radio guy in Philadelphia.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''The only reason I'm here is that I was mad then, and I'm mad now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen has bad memories, too -- from childhood summers in Bradley Beach -- of a person with a pith helmet and too much sunscreen who came after small children to make sure they had beach tags.</p>
        <p>He is serious, though, about the beach fees, which are seldom seen outside New Jersey. ''People from out of state are shocked to find out you have to pay $3 to get access to the Atlantic Ocean,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen, a Democrat, says the state should pay for beach maintenance, which is about $20 million a year. Having failed since 1997 to budge the Legislature on proposals for a dedicated fund and a constitutional amendment guaranteeing free public access, this year he introduced a bill, which also languished, that would create a commission to study beach fees.</p>
        <p>Almost all shore towns require beach tags, typically costing $3 to $5 for a day. The state courts have chipped away at municipal prerogatives, ruling first that beach towns could not exclude nonresidents, then that they could not charge nonresidents higher fees, and then that fees could not exceed actual maintenance costs.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cataldi said many towns offered their reduced seasonal rates only before Memorial Day, when nonresidents cannot buy tags, or stop selling tags early in the day. ''They've got a thousand different ways of putting the screws to the little guy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He and his attorney, George T. Kotch, want to challenge the state law that enables shore towns to charge fees, arguing that they are unconstitutionally discriminatory. ''The original impetus for charging beach fees was to keep minorities off the beach,'' Mr. Kotch said. ''Now it's to keep lower-income people off the beach.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kotch said he would raise the issue before the appellate division of Superior Court, where Mr. Cataldi's conviction is on appeal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cataldi noted that he was not exactly a little guy, but the renter of a $3,500-a-week house, on his two-week vacation in Avalon. He was on the beach, with a badge from the house supply, when his 22-year-old daughter, Meredith, dropped by -- with no badge, and a beach inspector trailing her.</p>
        <p>When she could not produce a tag, the inspector summoned a police officer, who reported that Mr. Cataldi's daughter shouted and cursed. (''The male then quieted her and said he would take the summons,'' the arrest report said, ''but not before informing me of his career as an important radio broadcaster.'')</p>
        <p>Mr. Cataldi was convicted in Municipal Court and fined $55 and $27 in court costs. A Superior Court judge upheld the conviction and sentence. At that point, Mr. Cataldi proceeded to the appellate division, contending, among other things, that an arrest was made without probable cause and that the lower courts improperly refused to admit evidence on the issue of whether Avalon's revenue exceeds reasonable beach-maintenance costs.</p>
        <p>The municipal prosecutor, Michael Donohue, said in an interview, ''I don't think Cataldi's case really has anything to do with the validity of the beach tag structure.''</p>
        <p>''He's kind of tried to turn it into that,' Mr. Donohue went on. ''Angelo Cataldi is an entertainer, and he's firing up his listeners.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Assemblyman Cohen saw another legislative session close without action on his beach-access bills. ''I'm a realist,'' he said. But he added. ''We'll be doing things down the shore'' to raise public ire. ''Two years ago, we went down with magnets. This year, T-shirts.''</p>
