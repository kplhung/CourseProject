        <p>After more than two years of rumors, squabbling and legal wrangling, a Canadian developer has finally bought one of the most sought-after corporate corners in Manhattan, and plans to build a 35-story skyscraper there.</p>
        <p>In all likelihood, the planned 1.2 million-square-foot tower near Grand Central Terminal, at the southwest corner of Madison Avenue and 42nd Street, will become the new home of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, real estate executives say. It would be the latest headquarters project among a handful of major office towers under construction or in the planning stages.</p>
        <p>Richard Clark, the president of Brookfield Properties Corporation's operations in the United States, confirmed that the company closed the deal with Credit Suisse First Boston on Friday. He said it was a complicated process that required the signing of 190 documents.</p>
        <p>''We're excited,'' Mr. Clark said. ''This gets us going again. It'll be a great addition to the 42nd Street corridor.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark said he was in negotiations with a major financial institution, although he would not identify it. But real estate executives who know of the plans said the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the largest bank in Canada, was expected to take at least two-thirds of the space in the tower. In what has become a routine demand by the city's most profitable corporations, the bank has asked the Giuliani administration for millions of dollars in tax breaks for the project.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, the Canadian Imperial Bank was planning to move into 7 World Trade Center when the current tenant, Salomon Smith Barney, suddenly decided to stay put. The bank, which owns a stake in Brookfield, looked at other possible locations before focusing on Madison Avenue.</p>
        <p>Just a few blocks north of the Brookfield site, Bear Stearns &amp; Company is building a tower at Madison Avenue and 46th Street, while to the west, workers are digging the foundation for the Ernst &amp; Young Building at 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue. Morgan Stanley is building its third tower in the Times Square area on Seventh Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets.</p>
        <p>Demolition has already begun on the world headquarters for the company formed by the expected merger of America Online and Time Warner in the twin-towered Columbus Center project at Columbus Circle. And The New York Times recently signed a nonbinding letter of intent with state and city officials to pay about $85 million for control of a site on Eighth Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets, for a new headquarters.</p>
        <p>Brookfield's proposed tower at Madison Avenue and 42nd Street has been a long time coming. The complex $150 million deal involved buying the 22-story, 87-year-old building at 300-310 Madison Avenue and two town houses, as well as air rights from three adjacent town houses, the Rogers Peet building and nearby Grand Central Terminal. Demolition of the office building, which is largely vacant, is expected to begin soon, according to Brookfield. Mr. Clark said construction should begin early next year.</p>
        <p>The project would be the first of several new office towers planned by Brookfield, which owns a large development site on Ninth Avenue at 31st Street and is one of several developers vying to build the New York Stock Exchange project in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>But if the 42nd Street deal is a new beginning for Brookfield, it is an exit ramp for another developer, Harry Macklowe. Mr. Macklowe had put the site together for his own comeback project, a large office tower. But he ran into trouble with his lender, Credit Suisse First Boston. After a long tug of war, First Boston took over the site and hired Mr. Macklowe to buy several adjacent parcels. Brookfield was supposed to buy the site last fall, but a new battle erupted between Mr. Macklowe and First Boston, delaying the sale for months.</p>
        <p>Brookfield now has control and is using Mr. Macklowe's old architect, Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, if not his designs.</p>
