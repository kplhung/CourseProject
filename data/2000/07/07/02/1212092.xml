        <p>Defying nature, Jazzland Theme Park opened recently east of New Orleans with a spectacular 4,000-foot-long roller coaster, 29 other rides and French Quarter-style architecture constructed on a platform four feet above what was formerly a soggy playground for alligators, armadillos and nutria.</p>
        <p>The casual visitor will be unaware that much of the 55-acre park is built on a massive but unobtrusive steel and concrete shelf resting on 18,000 wood pilings, 50 feet tall, sunk deep into the soft, damp earth of Louisiana's Mississippi River delta.</p>

        <p>Defying nature, Jazzland Theme Park opened recently east of New Orleans with a spectacular 4,000-foot-long roller coaster, 29 other rides and French Quarter-style architecture constructed on a platform four feet above what was formerly a soggy playground for alligators, armadillos and nutria.</p>
        <p>The casual visitor will be unaware that much of the 55-acre park is built on a massive but unobtrusive steel and concrete shelf resting on 18,000 wood pilings, 50 feet tall, sunk deep into the soft, damp earth of Louisiana's Mississippi River delta.</p>
        <p>Originally planned as an attraction focusing primarily on the infectious homegrown rhythms that attract millions of people annually to the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, the French Quarter Festival and the city's music clubs, Jazzland was expanded to include a variety of rides with names like the Muskrat Scrambler, Lafitte's Pirate Ship, Zydeco Scream and the Voodoo Volcano.</p>
        <p>A children's section, Kids' Carnival, offers an interactive playground and scaled-down versions of some of the adult rides.</p>
        <p>Among the music attractions is a Cajun-style dance hall near 17-acre Jazz Lake, where the last remaining alligators were ousted to make way for a five-times-a-day water-ski show. Popular Louisiana musicians perform at the dance hall daily from 4 to about 9 p.m. Dance hall food will include such Louisiana dishes as grilled or smoked Creole chicken ($6) and seafood boudin ($5).</p>
        <p>The Pontchartrain Beach section, offering fried catfish po-boys for $6, recalls the city's smaller, Art Deco lakeside amusement park that closed in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>Developed at a cost of $110 million, Jazzland is at 12301 Lake Forest Boulevard about eight miles east of the French Quarter near the intersection of I-10 and I-510; (504) 253-8100.</p>
        <p>Admission is $31; $26 for children. Open daily from June 2 to Aug. 20. The hours during May vary. Open weekends only from Aug. 26 to Oct. 29, and closed during the winter.</p>
