        <p>Letter from Steve Idemoto on William Safire's suggestions on indexing Social Security retirement age, in June 26 Op-Ed</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>William Safire suggests indexing the Social Security retirement age to life expectancy (column, June 26) both to improve Social Security's finances and to keep our minds active and healthy. But America is the most productive country in the world. Forcing the retirement age to 72 would be a slap in the face of the millions of American workers who work long and hard every day.</p>
        <p>For the wealthy, retirement age is a moot point. For the rest of us, retiring with our minds and bodies intact is a dream fulfilled. A full Social Security benefit cuts across class lines without punishing those at the lowest income levels.</p>

        <p>A more equitable way to increase Social Security financing is to lift the cap on taxable income and bring all state and local employees into the system.</p>
