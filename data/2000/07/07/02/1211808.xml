        <p>Brazilians Shine</p>
        <p>Q.: Is it true that most shoeshine men around town are Brazilian?</p>
        <p>A.: Actually, yes. Though the study of employment patterns in immigrant communities is an imprecise science, a study by Maxine L.

        <p>Brazilians Shine</p>
        <p>Q.: Is it true that most shoeshine men around town are Brazilian?</p>
        <p>A.: Actually, yes. Though the study of employment patterns in immigrant communities is an imprecise science, a study by Maxine L. Margolis, a professor of anthropology at the University of Florida, estimates that 90 to 95 percent of the shoeshine men working in the city are Brazilian.</p>
        <p>Many, in fact are from the same town: Governador Valadares, a city of 250,000 in Brazil's arid interior that since the 1960's has seen a large percentage of its population migrate to New York to escape that country's economic chaos and hyperinflation. Many work long days at menial jobs like washing dishes, cleaning houses or driving livery cabs, then return home after several years with what amounts to a small fortune.</p>
        <p>In ''An Invisible Minority: Brazilians in New York City'' (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1998), Ms. Margolis writes that in the 1960's, two brothers left Governador Valadares and found jobs shining shoes in Midtown. ''Word filtered back of the money to be made, and by the end of the decade a small contingent of Brazilians were shining shoes in the vicinity of Grand Central Station,'' she writes.</p>
        <p>''Their numbers slowly increased as networks of friends and relatives found shoeshine jobs for new arrivals in the city, and by the early 1980's this job sector, once the domain of African-Americans, was monopolized by Brazilians.''</p>
        <p>Getting Rid of Grit</p>
        <p>Q.: What goes on inside the low, 30's-style industrial building at 110th Street and the F.D.R. Drive? The words ''Manhattan Grit Chamber'' are carved above the door.</p>
        <p>A.: In communities like New York City, where glass, sand and gravel wash into the sewer along with storm water, a grit chamber is sometimes used to allow heavy, abrasive materials to settle before they can damage pumps or clog pipes at a water treatment facility.</p>
        <p>Geoffrey Ryan, spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection, said in the mid-30's, planners worried that grit would clog the deep underground tunnels linking sewers in Manhattan and the Bronx to the new water pollution control plant at Wards Island.</p>
        <p>The city built two grit chambers, this one and a Beaux-Arts gem designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White on Bruckner Boulevard in Mott Haven,  the Bronx. The chambers are emptied every few days and their contents trucked to out-of-state landfill sites. They function today exactly as they did in the 1930's, Mr. Ryan said, but grit chambers were not deemed necessary for the city's 13 other water treatment plants.</p>
        <p>Why Time Stands Still</p>
        <p>Q.: What happened to the clock on the steeple of St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery? I used to consult it on my way to and from work, but it's been stuck at 6:05 for ages, and I wonder if it will be repaired before I retire.</p>
        <p>A.: The clock was hit by lightning late last summer and hasn't ticked since, said Joan Coddington, administrator of the church. St. Mark's, built in 1799, is the city's second-oldest church building, after St. Paul's Chapel on lower Broadway (1766). The steeple wasn't added until 1828 and the carillon clock, which unlike the rest of the church is not a city landmark, dates from a renovation after a catastrophic 1978 fire.</p>
        <p>The church still awaits an estimate of repair costs, and an insurance settlement has not been negotiated, Ms. Coddington said.</p>
        <p>''We are a very poor church, with a congregation of about 60 people,'' she said. ''We have no idea what it will cost. We might have to put together a public appeal.''</p>
        <p>The carillon still chimes on the quarter hour, she said, though one  note sounds off key.</p>
