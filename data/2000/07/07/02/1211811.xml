        <p>WHEN you're hot, you're hot.</p>
        <p>I'm not talking about the weather, but about the attitude of many investors when choosing an investment adviser. They're surprisingly eager to follow an adviser with a poor long-term record, provided that he or she has had recent success. They believe that such advisers have so-called hot hands -- that just because they have beaten the market or their peers in the short term, they are likely to keep doing so for at least a while longer.</p>
        <p>These same investors, meanwhile, are quick to shun advisers with splendid long-term returns if their recent performance hasn't measured up.</p>
        <p>But can investment advisers really have hot hands? Statisticians have researched the matter exhaustively, and the picture that has emerged is somewhat mixed.</p>
        <p>The good news for hot-hand advocates is that investors will make more money by investing in last year's top market-beaters than they will by following advisers at the bottom of last year's list.</p>
        <p>The bad news is that this strategy probably won't help investors beat the market.</p>
        <p>Andrew Metrick, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, conducted one of the most extensive studies on the question. First he scrutinized every buy or sell recommendation on an American stock by 153 investment newsletter editors from 1980 to 1996. Then he constructed two hypothetical portfolios -- the first designed to follow the stock-picking recommendations of the 10 percent of advisers with the best performance during the previous calendar year, the second following the recommendations of the 10 percent with the worst records. He repeated the process every Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>Over all, the winners' portfolio produced a 15.7 percent return, annualized, from the end of 1980 through the end of 1996, versus 8.9 percent for the losers' portfolio. The overall stock market, meanwhile, gained 14.9 percent a year, on average, over the period.</p>
        <p>Great. So it appears that some advisers indeed have hot hands.</p>
        <p>There is a problem, however. The winning managers' portfolio may have beaten the overall market by 0.8 percentage point a year, but the calculations did not take transaction costs into account. It is likely that these costs would substantially reduce, if not eliminate, that advantage.</p>
        <p>BUT how do we explain that the hot advisers still outperformed Professor Metrick's losers portfolio by nearly 7 percentage points a year? I suspect that some advisers play an icy cold hand, either because of poor stock-picking ability or high transaction costs. In any event, the research suggests that while investors shouldn't necessarily follow advisers with the best one-year performance, they should certainly avoid those with the worst.</p>
        <p>Similar results have emerged from studies of mutual funds. Mark Carhart, a former assistant finance professor at the University of Southern California and now co-head of quantitative strategies at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, examined the performance of United States stock funds from 1962 through 1993. He initially found support for the hot-hand idea. During any given year, the previous year's top-performing funds have, on average, beaten the worst performers from the year earlier. But he later found that the pattern was more a function of the worst funds continuing their lackluster performance than the best ones continuing to shine.</p>
        <p>So, it seems, hot hands don't really exist in the world of investment advisers and newsletters. But cold ones do. Or to turn a phrase, when you're hot, apparently, you merely aren't freezing.</p>
