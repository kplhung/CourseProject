        <p>JIM THE BOY, by Tony Earley. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) A first novel, a coming-of-age novel, a Southern novel -- and yet no monsters, no parental abuse, erotic turmoil or domestic dysfunction! This clear, balanced, understated book makes growing up seem somehow possible.</p>

        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>THE ANGEL ON THE ROOF: The Stories of Russell Banks. (HarperCollins, $27.50.) An outstanding regional realist's relentless anatomy, in 31 stories, of contemporary life, chiefly in bleak sections of the northeastern United States.</p>
        <p>BEE SEASON, by Myla Goldberg. (Doubleday, $22.95.) An intelligent, dispassionate first novel that constructs and deconstructs a somewhat off-center Jewish family whose lives change when a hitherto ordinary fifth-grade daughter turns out to be an all-American spelling bee champ.</p>
        <p>JIM THE BOY, by Tony Earley. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) A first novel, a coming-of-age novel, a Southern novel -- and yet no monsters, no parental abuse, erotic turmoil or domestic dysfunction! This clear, balanced, understated book makes growing up seem somehow possible.</p>
        <p>LIVING TO TELL, by Antonya Nelson. (Scribner, $24.) A whole family -- the Mabies of Wichita, Kan. -- is the protagonist of this novel of wry, obsessive self-observation, beginning with the return of a son from a prison sentence for killing his grandmother in a drunken car crash.</p>
        <p>MOCKINGBIRD YEARS: A Life in and Out of Therapy, by Emily Fox Gordon. (Basic Books, $24.) A witty, sparkling memoir despite its principal matter: two decades of encounters with psychotherapists who were, with one splendid exception, remote, inappropriately involved or just peculiar.</p>
        <p>NO GREAT MISCHIEF, by Alistair MacLeod. (Norton, $23.95.) A Canadian orthodontist is this novel's narrator and the current focus of a tumult of memory and longing generated by a Scottish family that settled on Cape Breton in 1779.</p>
        <p>PLOWING THE DARK, by Richard Powers. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25.) An awfully smart novel of brute juxtaposition that crosscuts between two screening rooms of the mind: a cell in Beirut where an American hostage is held and a virtual-reality lab in Seattle.</p>
        <p>PONTIUS PILATE, by Ann Wroe. (Random House, $26.95.) A historian reconstructs the ambience in which the prefect of Judea spent his days, developing an absorbing, if speculative, biography of the Roman who judged Jesus.</p>
        <p>QUITTING THE NAIROBI TRIO, by Jim Knipfel. (Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam, $23.95.) The author, a gifted stylist, recounts his hospitalization after a suicide attempt some 15 years ago, the useless care he received and his own self-treatment through reading the works of Jacques Lacan.</p>
        <p>SHAKESPEARE'S LANGUAGE, by Frank Kermode. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $30.) A distinguished scholar and critic's investigation of Shakespeare's sensibility as conceived and as expressed in the development of his writing.</p>
