        <p>If an anniversary offers a convenient way by which a person can measure life's progress, then June 24 was a remarkable date for the Rev. Syngman Rhee. On that day, he was elected moderator of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the highest office in the nation's largest Presbyterian denomination.</p>
        <p>The election occurred exactly half a century after Mr. Rhee had been violently uprooted from his childhood home. ''Fifty years ago on this very day, the Korean War broke out,'' he said, ''and I became a refugee fleeing North Korea to the south. I was 19.'' He fled with a younger brother, leaving his parents, an older brother and four sisters, about whom he would hear nothing for 28 years.</p>
        <p>A well-known figure in ecumenical circles, Mr. Rhee (who is not related to the former South Korean president of the same name) is the first Asian-American to hold the moderator's job in the 211 years that American Presbyterians have maintained the office, the occupant of which serves a one-year term. He says he is excited that he was elected in the same month that the leaders of North and South Korea held their first summit meeting, offering hope for reconciliation between the two nations. That is a goal for which Mr. Rhee has worked, as an official within the Presbyterian Church and, in the early 1990's, as president of the National Council of Churches, which represents 35 Protestant and Eastern Orthodox churches.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rhee will soon embark on 12 months of nearly nonstop travel, meeting and preaching among the denomination's churches and seminaries. As moderator, he will have a national platform from which to expound a message of reconciliation, not only for Korea but also for the church, which has suffered a serious internal rift, primarily over how its members should respond to gay men and lesbians within their congregations. Three years ago, Presbyterians amended their constitution to forbid ordination of noncelibate gays as ministers, elders and deacons -- a decision that remains bitterly opposed by a substantial minority within the church.</p>
        <p>''To me, reconciliation is like building a bridge,'' Mr. Rhee said in an interview in a hotel here, across the street from the convention center where the Presbyterians' General Assembly, the policy-making body that elected him, was having its annual meeting.</p>
        <p>But trying to bring together opposing sides can be very difficult, even personally painful. In describing his experiences as an advocate of reconciliation between the Koreas, Mr. Rhee said, ''I was called all kinds of names -- pro-Communist, North Korean sympathizer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rhee, married and the father of three children, came to the United States in 1956 and was ordained a minister four years later. He holds a master's degree from Yale Divinity School and a doctorate from Chicago Theological Seminary.</p>
        <p>Until a merger in 1983, Presbyterians were divided into Northern and Southern churches, the legacy of a split in the Civil War. In the 1970's, Mr. Rhee worked for the Northern church, in a department that dealt with Christians in the Middle East. In his travels, he found that both North and South Korea maintained embassies in the same nations.</p>
        <p>In 1978, at a friend's urging, he decided to contact the North Korean Embassy in Egypt to try to obtain information about members of his family who had remained in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, at the war's outbreak. Mr. Rhee learned that father -- a Presbyterian minister who was imprisoned and died in the war -- had been friendly with a man who later became a very high official in the Communist government. Within days of the meeting, Mr. Rhee said, he received an invitation from his father's former friend for a private visit to North Korea.</p>
        <p>He hesitated to accept, he said, out of concern that if word of the trip got out, it could endanger his younger brother, a businessman in South Korea, where the government was hostile to the North. But after much prayer, he decided to go. ''Life depends on God, and God must have a purpose in providing this unexpected opportunity,'' Mr. Rhee said.</p>
        <p>In Pyongyang, he was reunited with his sisters. He learned his mother had died eight years earlier and his older brother had been killed in the war.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on his theme of reconciliation, Mr. Rhee said that as a young minister involved in the civil rights movement, he had learned from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that in a situation in which people are oppressed, they ultimately have the initiative, rather than the oppressor. King told him, he said, that the oppressed have a choice: to seek revenge for their hurts or to forgive and seek a new relationship.</p>
        <p>Forgiveness is fundamental to Christianity, Mr. Rhee said. ''Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation,'' he said. ''We should not be enslaved by the past, if we are looking for the possibility of a new day.''</p>
