        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I enjoyed very much Bernard Holland's article ''Of Music, Painting and Parallel Lines'' [June 18]. But as a visual artist, of course, I sometimes see the same things from a different viewpoint.</p>
        <p>Dancers have told me: ''At least you can hang it on the wall.'' They, like the musicians Mr. Holland speaks of, envy those of us who see an owner of our work and see ownership as a point of pride.</p>
        <p>But the fact that somebody owns the work in such a private way is not always to an artist's advantage. A writer works for months or years on a book. It is sold and the more people who read it, the better. A music group creates new work. They cut a CD and millions can hear it, and not at a big price.</p>
        <p>It takes me about two months to execute a painting, although I may have the idea in my head for years. I sell it to one person; one household gets to know this thing I've made. If I am lucky, a museum will eventually collect my work and then I have a larger audience, though still nothing like selling a CD or a novel. If the museum ever makes a postcard or calendar out of it (once I'm dead), then my audience will get bigger. While it is true that an art print and a CD are about the same in experience, i.e., not the real thing, to get to that CD is so much easier for the recording artist. How easy is it to collect or experience, on the mass market, contemporary visual art? From what I've seen, my chances grow once I'm dead.</p>
