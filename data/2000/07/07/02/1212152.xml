        <p>Although Amtrak has been operating some renovated Acela cars on the Northeast Corridor, they have been coupled to older engines and the trains have not reached the 150-mile-per-hour speeds expected from the new locomotives. Hopes for getting the all-new equipment into service last winter were dashed when the wheels wore excessively in high-speed tests.</p>
