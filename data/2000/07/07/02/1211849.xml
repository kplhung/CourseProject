        <p>LOUIS SCHWEITZER does not look like a gambler.</p>
        <p>Tall and lanky, a kind of Gallic Abe Lincoln, Mr. Schweitzer, 57, is a grandnephew of Albert Schweitzer and a distant cousin of Jean-Paul Sartre. Like many of the business elite of France, he is a product of L'Ecole Nationale d'Administration; he was chief of staff in the 1980's for Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, now the finance minister, and still enjoys good political connections. Mr. Schweitzer is, in short, the very model of French establishment probity.</p>
        <p>Yet he now finds himself chairman and chief executive of the auto giant Renault, which likes to boast that it was built on a bet. In company lore, its founder, Louis Renault, started by winning a wager in 1898 that a Renault with an innovative crankshaft could beat a car with a bicycle-like chain drive, common at the time, up a winding road in Montmartre. Renault won.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Schweitzer has become a gambler of sorts, too. Last year, he flew to Japan to sign a $5.4 billion deal to acquire a controlling stake in Nissan Motor after DaimlerChrysler had rejected the carmaker as unsalvageable. Mr. Schweitzer is wagering that a restored Nissan will become a solid partner in a globe-circling alliance.</p>
        <p>Nor is Nissan his only high-stakes wager. In 1996, he ventured into Latin America, building a $1 billion factory in Brazil, the first that Renault had built anywhere in 20 years, to make its successful Megane sedan. Last year, he paid $50 million for 51 percent of the Romanian carmaker Dacia, to gain a steppingstone into Eastern Europe. He also struck a deal to manufacture Renaults in an idle factory near Moscow. And this year, he bought a controlling stake in Samsung, the bankrupt South Korean carmaker.</p>
        <p>In the process, he has focused Renault on cars. First, he unloaded the company's foundry, bus-making divisions and Renault Automation, which makes auto factory equipment, to Fiat. In April, he sold the  industrial vehicles division to Volvo, while taking a 20 percent stake in that company.</p>
        <p>What is sobering, however, is that Renault has often lost on its biggest bets. In 1987, not long after Mr. Schweitzer joined the company, a strategy to enter North America by acquiring American Motors went sour. Six years later, after Mr. Schweitzer had become chairman, a marriage he had arranged with Volvo collapsed.</p>
        <p>Never before, moreover, has the company had more at stake. If Mr. Schweitzer's bets do not pay off, Renault risks falling prey to a takeover, or being forced into a humiliating surrender of independence. Renault was nationalized after World War II, and  while part of it was sold to private investors in the 1990's, the government retains 44 percent. Would the government stay neutral if the independence of such a national institution were threatened?</p>
        <p>Renault once believed that the future belonged to the swift, not to the big. Today, Mr. Schweitzer says the world auto industry will one day be dominated by a half-dozen giants, like General Motors, Ford Motor, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler. He wants Renault to be one of them.</p>
        <p>''If Renault survives, it will be one of the great world carmakers,'' said Elie Cohen, a leading French economist. ''If it fails, it will disappear.'' Mr. Cohen, echoing other experts, said Renault was, in a sense, ''condemned to take important risks, if it wanted to have a chance at survival.''</p>
        <p>The challenges are enormous. In Romania, economic progress has been dismal; at Samsung, Renault's reorganization has yet to begin. But the biggest test, most experts agree, will be in Japan. If Nissan, a stumbling, debt-ridden company, fails to revive in Japan and in the United States, the burden on Renault could prove unsustainable.</p>
        <p>''The future of Renault is being played out in Tokyo,'' Mr. Cohen said.  FEW people would have predicted all this when Mr. Schweitzer took over in 1992. Then, Renault was struggling with bad quality, a narrow product line and an overreliance on the French market. A few years before, without huge infusions of taxpayer money, Renault would have gone under or been taken over -- if anyone had wanted to buy it.</p>
        <p>Today, the company is among Europe's leaders in building cars cheaply and has largely overcome its quality problems. Models like the Scenic minivan are among Europe's most reliable. ''They are looked upon much more seriously today by the German manufacturers,'' said Stephen Reitman, who follows Renault at Merrill Lynch in London.</p>
        <p>The changes have meant profits. Renault's operating profit, before absorbing Nissan's losses, is strong, reaching 1.48 billion euros, about $1.4 billion, in 1999. It faced a loss of 330 million euros from Nissan last year, and that will hit 376 million euros just in the first half this year. Renault's stock price has gyrated accordingly. After soaring in January to a 52-week high of 54.95 euros, it fell to 38.60 in February and recovered to 51.80 in late May. But it has since slipped to 47.6 euros. Most analysts, not surprisingly, have adopted a wait-and-see attitude about the company's prospects.</p>
        <p>Still, the transformation of Renault reflects deep changes in France. As the government privatizes industries, executives like Mr. Schweitzer, steeped in traditional business practices, have learned to compete in a brasher, riskier climate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schweitzer's analysis of Renault's situation was simple: The breakdown of his proposed marriage with Volvo resulted in large part from continued government control of Renault, which Volvo shareholders felt was a threat to independence in making business decisions.</p>
        <p>Moreover, with Renault factories running at low capacity, cars were pricey; the slightest market downturn led to losses, as happened in 1996, three years after the Volvo breakup, when Renault had a net loss of just over $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schweitzer began by pushing the government to slash its stake. Helped by the election in 1993 of a conservative prime minister, Edouard Balladur, Mr. Schweitzer induced the government to cut its holdings to 52 percent, then to relinquish control by dropping to 44 percent.</p>
        <p>That was only the beginning. In 1996, to bring down costs, Mr. Schweitzer hired the man who, if all bets pay off, will probably be his successor: Carlos Ghosn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ghosn, now 46, had been the boy wonder at Michelin, the tire maker. When he was still in his 20's, he built Michelin's business in Latin America amid volatile national economies and, in Brazil, a soaring inflation rate. In 1990, he steered the merger of Michelin in North America with Uniroyal Goodrich. Though his methods earned him the title of ''le cost-cutter,'' colleagues recall human touches. When a Goodrich factory in Ardmore, Okla., was switched to multiple shifts, Mr. Ghosn (rhymes with loan) contacted local ministers, patiently explaining why some Sunday school teachers might not be available every week.</p>
        <p>Asked recently why he joined Renault, Mr. Ghosn showed his hunger to be tested. ''Renault, in Europe, is a prestigious name, with a very good history,'' he said. ''But I have always had an intuition that you don't join a company when things are good. You join when there are challenges, to earn your position.''</p>
        <p>MR. GHOSN'S recipes are classic. In purchasing, he cut the number of suppliers, to reduce administrative costs. In engineering, he created teams to develop products. In manufacturing, he reduced the number of models per plant and negotiated more flexible shifts. His plan was to save 20 billion francs -- $2.8 billion today -- in three years. ''We delivered it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nigel Griffiths, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's DRI in London, said one of Renault's greatest strengths was its use of manufacturing capacity, which he put at over 90 percent, close to American levels. ''Far better than the average in Europe,'' Mr. Griffiths said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ghosn's arrival signaled to workers and shareholders that ''this company has changed,'' said Philippe Martinez, head of the leftist labor union at Renault, Confederation Generale de Travail. ''It was good for the owners, but the message was political. It was a culture shock.''</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Ghosn who provoked the first test of Renault's independence. In 1997, he decided to close a factory at Vilvorde, Belgium, cutting 3,000 jobs. Renault workers in France and Belgium took to the streets, and the recently elected Socialist prime minister of France, Lionel Jospin, begged Mr. Schweitzer to reverse the decision. Mr. Schweitzer  said no.</p>
        <p>For many people, Vilvorde reflects just how much Renault has changed. Once a union stronghold, the company by 1997 had stopped being a social laboratory where politicians tested labor reforms before introducing them nationwide. Mr. Schweitzer's predecessor, Raymond Levy, signaled the change in 1992, closing Renault's oldest plant, at Billancourt, on an island in the Seine near Paris. The plant had long been a symbol of French labor militancy: in 1968, when students protested in Paris,  Mr. Schweitzer's cousin Jean-Paul Sartre stood at Billancourt's gates to call auto workers to join them. But at Vilvorde, the unions ultimately accepted the inevitable. It was Renault's last major labor unrest.</p>
        <p>THE changes at Renault say much about Mr. Schweitzer's own evolution. His experience has enabled him to manage both politics and business. Mr. Cohen, the economist, says a peculiar blend of French culture and Protestant ethic enabled him to make painful decisions. ''He lost friends on the left,'' Mr. Cohen said, adding that ''he is a man totally identified with Renault.''</p>
        <p>A French executive who has known Mr. Schweitzer since college days calls him a ''quintessentially French mind: conceptual, yet not lost in fantasies; able to decide.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Schweitzer and the Brazilian-born Mr. Ghosn worked hand in glove, despite enormous personal differences. Mr. Schweitzer is an expert in numbers; Mr. Ghosn received his degree from L'Ecole des Mines, a top engineering school, though he later earned a doctorate in economics at the University of Paris. While Mr. Schweitzer had been chief aide to a Socialist prime minister, Mr. Ghosn had always been in business. And the cerebral strain in Mr. Schweitzer contrasts with Mr. Ghosn's Latin exuberance.</p>
        <p>Yet the success of the two men would probably have been impossible without the artistic flair of a third.</p>
        <p>In 1987, when Mr. Schweitzer was chief financial officer, Renault hired a new chief designer, Patrick Le Quement, whose talent shaped the education of Louis Schweitzer -- and the transformation of Renault.</p>
        <p>Born in France and educated in Britain, Mr. Le Quement earned a reputation as one of Europe's most daring designers while working in the 1980's for Ford and Volkswagen. He joined Renault, he said, because of its tradition of risk taking. ''When you're a kid, you have your favorite Dinky toys,'' he said in an interview, referring to the toy cars known by generations of young English boys. ''Mine were Renault.''</p>
        <p>His first task was to complete the design of a diminutive model, later dubbed the Twingo. Mr. Le Quement took an earlier design, widened it and gave it headlights like frogs' eyes and a snoot that made it look, he said,  ''like a pet: in winter you don't want to leave it outside; you place it next to the fireplace.''</p>
        <p>The design polarized management. Some, like Mr. Schweitzer, hated it, though he now says his objection was to the way the project was financed. In a desperate appeal to the chairman at the time, Raymond Levy, Mr. Le Quement said he wrote that ''the biggest risk with the car was to take no risk.'' Mr. Levy agreed.</p>
        <p>By 1994, Renault was selling little Twingos about as fast as it could make them, nearly 20,000 a month. Under Mr. Le Quement, other remarkable models followed, including the Scenic, a micro-minivan that has also been a big seller.</p>
        <p>By the mid-1990's, when Renault decided to revive its luxury car line, Mr. Schweitzer was easily won over to a daring design based on a concept car called the Avantime, a futuristic sedan with an oddly truncated rear end and wraparound rear window.</p>
        <p>Not only are Renault's designs changing, but so is the way they are put together. Mr. Le Quement's office, adorned with bright canvases, has for two years been in Renault's new $785 million Technocentre, which opened in 1998 on former farmland west of Paris. In its central wing, La Ruche (the hive), and adjacent wing, Le Diapason (the tuning fork), experts from design and research, vehicle engineering, purchasing and product cost analysis -- once scattered over 50 sites -- work jointly to bring down costs and development time. Renault's successful subcompact, the Clio, took 40 months to develop before it was introduced in 1991; recent models have taken 36 months, and the target is 20.</p>
        <p>As for shopping for a partner in Asia, Mr. Schweitzer says the idea was born during the Asian economic crisis. ''We saw an opportunity,'' he said. Nissan ''was fundamentally a sound company, with good products.''</p>
        <p>The process was accelerated in 1998 when Daimler-Benz announced its takeover of Chrysler. ''This was an electric shock in the industry,'' Mr. Ghosn said. ''It was obvious for us that we had to connect fast.''</p>
        <p>The next year, Renault took its stake in Nissan, and Mr. Ghosn was dispatched to revive it. Now chief operating officer at Nissan, he will become president this summer, the first foreigner to assume such a prestigious role at a major Japanese corporation.</p>
        <p>At Nissan, Mr. Ghosn has set clear goals, and his record for meeting objectives is enviable. By the end of 2002, he said, 22 new models are planned, including four in Japan later this year. By the end of 2003, he wants to cut Nissan's debt by half, from $16.8 billion at the end of March. And he expects the company  to be profitable in the current fiscal year, which ends next March, after losses in seven of the last eight years.</p>
        <p>Change is also apparent elsewhere in the global operations. Today, Mr. Schweitzer says Renault is focusing on distribution. It is the European leader in shrinking order-to-delivery times, building about half its cars to order and delivering them in six to eight weeks. The goal, at least in Europe, is to make three-quarters of its cars to order and to deliver them in 14 days, matching what the Japanese often do in their home market. In April, to cut purchasing costs, it joined Covisint, the online marketplace set up by G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler to consolidate the search for parts and services.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schweitzer said he wanted to emphasize different Renault brands in different markets, making Renault strongest in Europe and Latin America; Nissan (and its Infiniti luxury division) in North America; Nissan and Samsung in Asia; and Dacia in Eastern Europe and emerging markets. It is not a novel recipe. Volkswagen supplemented its VW and Audi brands by snapping up Skoda in the Czech Republic and Seat in Spain. Yet unlike Volkswagen's cars, Renault's brands do not compete with one another. ''Why buy a Volkswagen at German prices,'' Mr. Cohen said, ''when you can get a Skoda, the same car, at Czech prices?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schweitzer says Renault's plans are on track, though much work remains. In Europe, Renault and Nissan have begun melding their sales organizations, but the bulk of reorganization is still ahead at Dacia and Samsung. In Latin America, Nissan models will be produced at Renault plants, and Mr. Ghosn says that by 2010 he wants 10 common platforms, or underbodies, so that the companies can build Renaults and Nissans everywhere, while maintaining the look, feel and identity of their separate brands. Nissan alone currently has some two dozen platforms, none of them shared with Renault or other brands.</p>
        <p>THE investment in Nissan has already paid off handsomely. Mr. Reitman of Merrill Lynch calculates that Renault's stake is now worth roughly 8.25 billion euros, or $7.8 billion, 65 percent more than Renault paid for it.</p>
        <p>One bottleneck could be finding managers to run all the operations. Mr. Reitman says one reason for selling the industrial-vehicles division to Volvo was to free up Renault management. To replace Mr. Ghosn when he left for Nissan, Mr. Schweitzer lured a senior Volkswagen executive, Pierre-Alain De Smedt, a Belgian who was chief executive of VW's Seat division.</p>
        <p>But that was an exception. Local talent is crucial to Mr. Schweitzer's concept, for despite all of Renault's globalization -- the common language of executive meetings and reports is now English, which Mr. Schweitzer speaks fluently -- he misses no occasion to stress his appreciation of national qualities.</p>
        <p>''I think car companies need roots,'' he said, since ''there are links between products, company culture and the nationality of the group.''</p>
        <p>The heart of his vision is the link with Nissan. ''We are talking about a binational group,'' he said, adding that such a structure could be ''clearly only fully productive if the two companies are working well.''</p>
        <p>''An alliance,'' he said, ''is not a substitute for bringing your house in order.''</p>
