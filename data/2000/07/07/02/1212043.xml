        <p>YOU say you're uninspired by your election choices? Are you focusing on the wrong candidates?</p>
        <p>Maybe you'll want to vote for Billy and Mandy, a pair of resourceful tykes who can outsmart the Grim Reaper. Or maybe you'd rather cast your ballot for the woman who dresses up her dog and her cat like little people, or the guy who lives in a trailer with a talking horse and a singing nephew.</p>
        <p>No, these candidates aren't running on some fringe ticket. They're running on the Cartoon Network.</p>

        <p>YOU say you're uninspired by your election choices? Are you focusing on the wrong candidates?</p>
        <p>Maybe you'll want to vote for Billy and Mandy, a pair of resourceful tykes who can outsmart the Grim Reaper. Or maybe you'd rather cast your ballot for the woman who dresses up her dog and her cat like little people, or the guy who lives in a trailer with a talking horse and a singing nephew.</p>
        <p>No, these candidates aren't running on some fringe ticket. They're running on the Cartoon Network.</p>
        <p>Since June 9 that cable channel has been offering the premiere of one animated short every Friday night at 9. After the 10th is shown late next month, the network, with help from viewer focus groups and a peek at the ratings, will choose three finalists among them and ask viewers to vote for their favorite. Those candidates will be shown again in time for the balloting, via mail, phone and the Internet. The winner is to become a Cartoon Network series in 2001.</p>
        <p>''Our viewers are never wrong,'' said Linda Simensky, the network's vice president for original animation. While this is the first formal election, she said, other pilots that were favorably received by the audience -- including ''Johnny Bravo'' and ''The Powderpuff Girls'' -- have gone on to become some of the network's most popular shows (and are also trotting out new episodes on weeknights during the summer).</p>
        <p>This week's Friday feature is ''Foe Paws,'' created by Chris Savino, who has worked as a story artist on other Cartoon Network shows. He has imagined a wise-guy cat and a goodhearted dog who are taken home from the pet shop by a woman with a burlesque Italian accent. She's lonely now that ''my children they get-a too big and they move away.''</p>
        <p>Next Friday you can meet Uncle Gus, created by Lincoln Pierce, who draws the syndicated comic strip ''Big Nate.'' Gus is the guy in the trailer with his nephew, Beeyotus, and Flapjack the talking horse. Their maiden voyage takes them to the zoo, where Gus is surprised to find that his long-lost love, Zeena, is the monkey expert. There's some monkey business, and Beeyotus ends up defeating Dwayne, the dominant male, in a fight. Thus Beeyotus becomes king of the apes. But what does that make Uncle Gus?</p>
        <p>The premieres began with Maxwell Atoms's ''Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy,'' in which Death, who has come for Billy's hamster, Mr. Snuggles, speaks with a West Indian lilt. Billy's something of a twit. When the Grim Reaper declares, ''I'm afraid it's curtains for Mr. Snuggles,'' Billy happily says, ''You got him curtains?'' But Mandy is smart enough for both of them, thank you. (This is the Cartoon Network, after all, one small piece of the planet where children, often girls, are generally considered much brighter and more noble than mere adults.) When Death asks, ''How low can you go?'' Mandy can be counted on to defeat him in a soulful limbo contest.</p>
        <p>This parade of animated newcomers has already included young protagonists like Trevor, who has some far-out daydreams during math class, and Nikki, who follows unhappy strangers on the street in her bumbling attempts to help them. Entries in coming weeks will feature Prickles, a klutzy cactus, and a pair of intellectual cavemen called Longhair and Doubledome who are hopelessly inept at dealing with their prehistoric existence.</p>
        <p>After the 10 premieres, the network will offer a preview of its new fall series, Mo Willems's ''Sheep in the Big City,'' on Aug. 18. This serial, complete with cliffhangers and overheated narration, tells the touching story of a sheep named Sheep, who is forced to flee his happy home at the farm of Farmer John, ''a man who loves farming so much his first name is Farmer.''</p>
        <p>Sheep is being pursued by the evil General Specific (he works with General Motors, General Assembly and General Hospital), who runs a top-secret agency and wants to use Sheep in the creation of a superpowerful weapon, the sheep-powered Destructo-Zap 3000. So Sheep leaves the farm and heads for the big city, where he finds a job as a telemarketer, shouting ''Baaaaah!'' into his telephone headset all day.</p>
        <p>Will the general find Sheep? Will Farmer John stop pining for his lost friend? Will Sheep call you just when you sit down to dinner?</p>
        <p>Like much of today's television animation, from ''The Simpsons'' to those ubiquitous commercials, most of the cartoon shorts shown this summer have a deceptively simple visual style. But these are sophisticated productions. Many will amuse adults, although all are suitable for children.</p>
        <p>Films like these don't just land unbidden on the Cartoon Network doorstep. Ms. Simensky said she and her colleagues kept in touch with a number of promising artists, putting a dozen or so of their new ventures into production each year. The films are made either by independent studios or directly by Cartoon Network under the imprimatur of Hanna-Barbera, another unit of Time Warner.</p>
        <p>''Some work, some don't,'' she said of the new films. Those that do work get their chance with the electorate.</p>
        <p>So maybe these are just the candidates the voters have been looking for. But if Uncle Gus wins, do you suppose he'll make Flapjack secretary of state?</p>
