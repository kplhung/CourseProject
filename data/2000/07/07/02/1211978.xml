        <p>In the third drowning off the waters of the Rockaway peninsula in less than a week, an 11-year-old boy who jumped into Jamaica Bay, near Far Rockaway, Queens, on Friday afternoon was pulled from the water by rescuers but died later at a hospital, the police said.</p>
        <p>The incident occurred at 3:20 p.m. in Norton Basin, where swimming is not allowed. The area is either part of the federal park system or privately owned, said Robert Lawson, a spokesman for the city's Parks and Recreation Department, which oversees its public beaches. Because the area is not a designated swimming area, lifeguards are not posted there, Mr. Lawson said.</p>

        <p>In the third drowning off the waters of the Rockaway peninsula in less than a week, an 11-year-old boy who jumped into Jamaica Bay, near Far Rockaway, Queens, on Friday afternoon was pulled from the water by rescuers but died later at a hospital, the police said.</p>
        <p>The incident occurred at 3:20 p.m. in Norton Basin, where swimming is not allowed. The area is either part of the federal park system or privately owned, said Robert Lawson, a spokesman for the city's Parks and Recreation Department, which oversees its public beaches. Because the area is not a designated swimming area, lifeguards are not posted there, Mr. Lawson said.</p>
        <p>The police said the boy, identified as Russell Joseph of St. Albans, Queens, was swimming with another child, who was not identified, when he went under the water and did not surface. The police responded to a call for help and sent divers to rescue the boy. He was taken to Peninsula Hospital, where he died at 6:05 p.m., the police said. It was unclear whether any adults were with the children when they went into the water.</p>
        <p>Last Sunday, a mother and her 6-year-old daughter drowned on the other side of the peninsula, off Rockaway Beach, in the Atlantic Ocean. The girl was swimming with her cousin about 7:20 p.m. -- more than an hour after lifeguards went off duty at 6 p.m. -- when her mother saw her struggling and jumped in to save her. The woman, Mercedes Segura, 40, of the Inwood section of Manhattan, and her daughter, Caridad Munoz, later died, but her niece  Rita Vega, 9, survived.</p>
        <p>That incident prompted the parks department to add evening patrols from 6 to 8:30 p.m. to two of the biggest city beaches, Coney Island and Rockaway Beach.</p>
