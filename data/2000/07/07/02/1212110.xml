        <p>WHEN Jill Kerr and Chris Ytuarte decided to live together, they considered  moving to Manhattan. But they never actually got around to looking, because whenever they would think of people they knew, people in their early 20's, squashed into small expensive apartments in, say, the East 90's, they knew they didn't want to live like that.</p>
        <p>Starting over and finding a place together seemed like a good idea, but in the end, they decided to live in the spacious one-bedroom, $950-a-month  apartment Ms. Kerr has been renting for two years, on 72nd Road in Forest Hills, Queens.</p>

        <p>WHEN Jill Kerr and Chris Ytuarte decided to live together, they considered  moving to Manhattan. But they never actually got around to looking, because whenever they would think of people they knew, people in their early 20's, squashed into small expensive apartments in, say, the East 90's, they knew they didn't want to live like that.</p>
        <p>Starting over and finding a place together seemed like a good idea, but in the end, they decided to live in the spacious one-bedroom, $950-a-month  apartment Ms. Kerr has been renting for two years, on 72nd Road in Forest Hills, Queens.</p>
        <p>Each has a commute to Manhattan of about 25 minutes; Ms. Kerr currently manages the library at an investment firm and is about to start a job writing reports for institutional clients in global communications. Mr. Ytuarte (pronounced EE-to-it) is a reporter covering fresh food for the trade publication Supermarket News.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kerr grew up in Floral Park, in Nassau County, right across the border from Bellerose, Queens, where Mr. Ytuarte was raised. Both still have a lot of friends living at home with their parents, in large part because moving out is so expensive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ytuarte, who worked at a newspaper last summer in New Hampshire, returned to New York in September feeling he had no choice but to go out on his own. ''I was sleeping on my dad's futon,'' he said. He could have lived with his mother, also in Queens, but she, too, has a one-bedroom apartment. It was a choice of futons, he said, and ''I wanted a real bed; I wanted to be out on my own.''</p>
        <p>He looked for studio apartments through the fall and winter, but found that he was spending most of his time with Ms. Kerr, whom he had recently starting seeing, years after they had met in their first year of high school.</p>
        <p>THEY are both 24, and people their age who live in Manhattan, Ms. Kerr said, often seem to live in tiny spaces subsidized by their parents. ''I don't know why people do it,'' she said. When she began looking for an apartment, she wanted space, and light, and air. If that meant forgoing Manhattan, she didn't mind, although Queens, she said, ''is considered out of it.''</p>
        <p>They think they're the youngest people in their apartment building, and they have no friends in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>They like it there, though, particularly the charming Austin Street, which has a Banana Republic, a Benetton and several good restaurants.</p>
        <p>Their apartment, in a rent-stabilized building where apartments that come on the market these days would probably rent for $1,200 or so, has high ceilings, beautiful wood floors and about 900 square feet, which gives them plenty of room. ''My cousin and her boyfriend lived in a studio in Manhattan,'' Mr. Ytuarte said. ''I don't understand how anybody can do that. I can sit out here, and Jill can be in the bedroom.''</p>
        <p>They have a pleasing, leafy view. It used to be more sweeping, encompassing the lake in Flushing Meadow, but in the spring a 10-story apartment building began rising nearby. ''It was a great view,'' said Ms. Kerr. ''It just had a very open feel. That's one of the best things about Queens,  that you don't feel claustrophobic.''</p>
        <p>They're upset by the change, but not so seriously that they want to move. Besides, Mr. Ytuarte said, he can still see Shea Stadium, where he goes 15 or 20 times every summer, for Mets games.</p>
        <p>''I still have the view I care about,'' he said.</p>
