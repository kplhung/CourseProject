        <p>I wondered how Swedesboro got its name -- for about 12 seconds. Then I saw the giant sign proclaiming that Swedes settled the town in 1638. Just below, I read of visits from Swedish royalty: Prince Bertil in 1938, and King Carl XVI Gustaf in 1976. I must admit, I was intimidated by the Swedish pedigree. My only brushes with the culture's cuisine have been Swedish meatballs and . . . . So it was with great relief that I stumbled upon Rode's Fireside, an old-fashioned American family restaurant. Within the unassuming exterior is a surprisingly spacious room, with ample tables and a large bar. (Covered outdoor seating is also available.) Above you are Tiffany lamps, ceiling fans, and hanging plants; below is a hardwood floor. And there's a big fireplace. After all, this isn't Rode's Space Heater Restaurant. I sat at the bar, because that is what lonely men do when they find themselves in Swedesboro on a Sunday afternoon. The wait staff, identically dressed in light red shirts, dark red aprons and khakis (I was assured this was not the national costume of Sweden), were all friendly and attentive. Like any self-respecting Pennsylvania border-town bar, Rode's offers Yuengling lager on tap. It nicely complemented an Old Hickory dhicken sandwich -- a juicy chicken breast, topped with cheddar, barbecue sauce and succulent bacon. But it's not just sandwiches; Rode's serves a full slate of pasta, steak, chicken, and seafood entrees, priced from $8.95 to $17.95. I saw a ''Fresh Eggs'' sign on the wall, and thought to myself, that it was one of those phony down-home decorations you see in T.G.I. Friday's. But back in the parking lot, I noticed a truck: ''Otto C. Rode Inc., Farm Fresh Butter &amp; Eggs, established 1880.'''What can I say? T.G.I.Rode.</p>
