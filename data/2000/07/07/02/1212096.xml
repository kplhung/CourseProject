        <p>Depending on how you look at it, Route 66 was a strip of the true vernacular or an asphalt hustle. Perhaps it was always both. Route 66 was commissioned in 1926, fully paved in 1938, its last stretch replaced by an Interstate in 1984. During the Depression and World War II, it was a historic migratory corridor from the Midwest to the Southwest and California. In ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' John Steinbeck called Route 66 ''the mother road'' but also, more accurately, ''the road of flight.'' It was the road across ''the Western States,'' a road on which no one ever traveled east, on which caravans of drifters and laborers and uprooted families moved in the one iconic direction, toward the Pacific Ocean. ''Need,'' Steinbeck wrote, ''is the stimulus to concept, concept to action.'' The action that grew up along Route 66 during its boom years is legendary. That was where, and how, America learned what it means to be on the road with an automobile. Every motel, every auto camp, every drive-in along the way was somebody's pipe dream come true, and the road ahead was a pipe dream, too. The highway followed the lay of the land. It ran down Main Street and right out of town. It carried away the people you knew and brought strangers in their place.</p>
        <p>As its economic importance dwindled, the highway's nostalgic importance grew, and it took only nostalgia to turn the Route 66 wayside into kitsch. The old continuous Route 66 is nearly as gone as the Oregon Trail. But America loves to memorialize its transience, and now Congress has passed a bill guaranteeing $10 million over the next 10 years to help rehabilitate Route 66.</p>

        <p>What remains is the scenery -- the wide-open void -- and the towns themselves. You know the names from the Bobby Troup song, recorded by Nat King Cole: St. Louis, Joplin, Oklahoma City, Amarillo, Gallup, Winona, Flagstaff, Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino. But also Chenoa, Ill; Baxter Springs, Kan.; Yukon and Elk City, Okla.; Tucumcari, N.M.; Peach Springs, Ariz.; Needles, Calif.; and a hundred others like them. They sound like left-behind places, but they're not. They're the dots that any cross-country highway connects almost anywhere in America.</p>
        <p>Route 66 is still the road of flight. The migration goes on, as these photographs by Edward Keating attest. It's no longer a mass movement, but the sense of drift is much the same as it was when people were fleeing the Depression, the Dust Bowl and debt. Turn your eyes very far from the main road, and you come across some of the people Edward Keating found -- prostitutes, topless dancers, missionaries, Bible distributors and the dislocated. The migration is sometimes actual, and sometimes an internal one, a readjustment of expectations, whether you stay put or move along. The transience that Keating memorializes isn't the tourist traps or the roadside architecture of America's hectic fantasy. It's something in the glance, something in the feeling you can see in these eyes. You try to stand still, they seem to say, but the ground moves beneath you. No matter what you do, the highway ends up running right down your back.</p>

        <p>Correction:  July 23, 2000, Sunday  A picture caption on July 2 with an article about Route 66 misidentified the location of an intersection in California. It was Los Angeles, not Santa Monica.</p>
