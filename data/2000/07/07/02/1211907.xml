        <p>The stock market ended a difficult first half on an upbeat note last week as investors breathed a sigh of relief after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged during its latest policy meeting.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average finished the week at 10,447.89, up 43.14, while the Nasdaq composite index closed at 3,966.11, up 120.77.</p>
        <p>The Fed acted precisely as everyone had expected, which is pretty unusual, said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W Baird &amp; Company in Milwaukee. The feeling now is that if inflation stays under control and we have a soft landing, maybe we won't see any more rate increases for a while.</p>
        <p>The Fed has raised short-term rates six times in the last year to slow the economy. Last week, while noting that inflation risks persist, the central bank decided against more increases for the time being.</p>
        <p>With that decided, investors focused on leading technology companies that are expected to post strong second-quarter profits, including Hewlett-Packard, whose stock price rose.</p>
        <p>Scattered earnings disappointments, though, dragged other stocks lower, including Goodyear and American Financial.</p>
