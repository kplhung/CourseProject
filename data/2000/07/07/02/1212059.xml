        <p>TWO glossy sources of awe and envy recently met in a Grasmere parking lot to signal that summer had come to Staten Island: a muscle car rally and the Hooters Calendar Girls. Cars and their owners gathered under the auspices of the Richmond County Corvette Club. The Calendar Girls were publicizing a Hooters restaurant that has been host to the club on Wednesday nights for two years. An otherwise unaffiliated group of men came to gawk.</p>
        <p>About 30 cars and their owners showed up, just one-third of the club's best attendance, but well above average for a night that threatens rain. Standing next to his 1969 Dodge Charger R/T, Chris Giardina explained: ''You get your engine and your undercarriage spotless. You drive in the rain. Just to clean it can take three hours.'' So why the healthy turnout? Let's just say everyone gets a calendar.</p>

        <p>TWO glossy sources of awe and envy recently met in a Grasmere parking lot to signal that summer had come to Staten Island: a muscle car rally and the Hooters Calendar Girls. Cars and their owners gathered under the auspices of the Richmond County Corvette Club. The Calendar Girls were publicizing a Hooters restaurant that has been host to the club on Wednesday nights for two years. An otherwise unaffiliated group of men came to gawk.</p>
        <p>About 30 cars and their owners showed up, just one-third of the club's best attendance, but well above average for a night that threatens rain. Standing next to his 1969 Dodge Charger R/T, Chris Giardina explained: ''You get your engine and your undercarriage spotless. You drive in the rain. Just to clean it can take three hours.'' So why the healthy turnout? Let's just say everyone gets a calendar.</p>
        <p>The owners arrange the cars in facing rows, not unlike a nature documentary in which large beasts gather at twilight around a watering hole. (If you pull in with a Honda sedan or other automotive beta male, you are politely but firmly waved to the back of the pack.) Then one by one they open their hoods. Members prowl down the rows and check out the engine modifications, in which  horsepower by the score is added.</p>
        <p>First things first, though. Most members head to the restaurant to enjoy their Wednesday night discount on beer and burgers, and the abbreviated symmetries of the employee dress code. What is it in pop culture that insists on combining cars with the revealed female anatomy?</p>
        <p>Short answer: sex. ''It's kind of like a flirtation thing,'' said Susie Lin (Miss June), who recites an example of cruise-strip dialogue: ''I've got a nice car. You've got a nice body. How about it, babe?''</p>
        <p>In the end, the Calendar Girls were a passing attraction. They filed into their limousine and were chauffeured to Manhattan for their next round of promotions.</p>
        <p>But a cool car is a joy forever. Carmine Fragpane said that 20 years ago he sold his 1959 powder blue Corvette for $15,000 (he had bought it for $1,000). He used the money for a down payment.</p>
        <p>''But I was dying for another Corvette,'' he said. Which explained his contented smile as he gazed at the 1993 cherry red model he bought just in time for the summer cruising season.</p>
        <p>John Ruggiero, a 40-year-old radiology supervisor, was also smiling. In April he won $15,000 at an Atlantic City slot machine.  As the machine lighted up, his mind fixed on the 1991 candy-apple red Corvette he had looked at the week before but could not afford.</p>
        <p>The money made his vehicular dreams come true, but Mr. Ruggiero still plays the slots. Why? Because there is always a better 'vette. ''If I hit another jackpot,'' he said, ''I'll trade in this car and buy the latest one.'' He looked at the traffic on Hylan Boulevard, seeing himself at the wheel of a bigger, bosser Corvette in an even sweeter summer to come.</p>
