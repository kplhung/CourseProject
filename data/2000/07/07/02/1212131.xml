        <p>IF the news is true, the record business is not being nice to classical music. The Washington Post reports that such respected labels as RCA Red Seal, Deutsche Harmonia Mundi and Melodiya, all owned or distributed by the international giant BMG, will be either shunted aside as minor activities of the American, pop-oriented RCA label or put out of business altogether.</p>
        <p>We do know that two of BMG Classics' busiest stars have been left dangling. Evelyn Glennie, the Scottish percussionist, generates enormous amounts of publicity because of her prowess and her struggles against deafness; James Galway, the Irish flutist, has ravished the sensible-shoe set for a generation. Yet Ms. Glennie has had her contract cut off without warning, and Mr. Galway's will not be renewed. The New York Times offers the further news (disputed by BMG Entertainment) that BMG Classics will not be recording at all outside this country.</p>

        <p>IF the news is true, the record business is not being nice to classical music.

        <p>We do know that two of BMG Classics' busiest stars have been left dangling. Evelyn Glennie, the Scottish percussionist, generates enormous amounts of publicity because of her prowess and her struggles against deafness; James Galway, the Irish flutist, has ravished the sensible-shoe set for a generation. Yet Ms. Glennie has had her contract cut off without warning, and Mr. Galway's will not be renewed. The New York Times offers the further news (disputed by BMG Entertainment) that BMG Classics will not be recording at all outside this country.</p>
        <p>Understandably, the hand-wringing has stirred up a breeze, and fingers are pointing every which way, often down in the direction of the bottom line. Never or rarely moneymakers, classical recordings have, quite frankly, been an object of charity in the marketplace. If pop-music profits made the cup run over, the producers of Beethoven and Brahms were there to catch the runoff. Record companies are no longer as responsive, and it is easy and sometimes proper to censure their crassness.</p>
        <p>Those not overburdened with culture have a hard time understanding why their increasingly hard-earned net income should be squandered on enterprises that sell 15,000 to 20,000 copies at most, as against the millions generated by Ricky Martin. But shake your fists at record companies all you want; they are reacting indirectly to a bigger problem: the nature of classical music as it has come to be.</p>
        <p>Popular music is predicated on the attractions of newness, the current classical business on the attractions of oldness. Taken at face value, the comparison is unfair. The newness of the Ricky Martin single has planned obsolescence -- a short, fast-moving shelf life -- built in. And although many of the world's interesting new musical impulses are coming from anywhere but high-art sources, the broad floods of pop releases are as quick and forgettable as summer fireflies.</p>
        <p>New classical composers aspire to music that is built to last. They are the inheritors of a 19th-century masterpiece syndrome that linked quality with permanence and durability. And maybe their products have both. But the problem is the public, which is not buying their records.</p>
        <p>It is admirable and necessary that foundations of one kind or other are helping to commit living composers to compact disc. The fact that the general public isn't rushing to buy books on the latest archaeological dig or genome discovery, or, for that matter, recordings of the latest chamber music of Wayne Peterson, doesn't mean that essential artifacts to a continuing culture shouldn't be propped up by donors and universities.</p>
        <p>But in the record business, philanthropy and industry have become hopelessly confused. With pop-music income under threat, corporate high-mindedness toward releases that people buy only in pitiful numbers has understandably weakened.</p>
        <p>The classical end has managed up to now by recording the standard repertory and then recording it again. If the recordings are old enough, they qualify as mythical voices from a distant past. The technical imperfections are cleaned up, and releases are repackaged and set out in bins next to the standard repertory freshly recorded and the standard repertory recorded not so long ago. They add up.</p>
        <p>Classical music on records is in trouble not because the BMG labels are being martyred by bad guys in fancy offices; it is the victim of a self-induced glut. In the early LP days, the proliferation of recordings created healthy competition among performances of the same piece. This stimulated listeners up to a point. But faced now with 50 choices of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony, customers -- even those who might want to own 5 to 10 versions -- are terminally embarrassed by such riches and walk away in despair.</p>
        <p>And the question lurks: after all the great orchestras and conductors of recent times have recorded their deathless interpretations of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony, what more is there to say about this piece? Ardent connoisseurs will argue for the great new revelation to come and keep on listening and comparing. Frankly, I know how the Beethoven Seventh goes, and the ideal performance of it is in my head.</p>
        <p>If one good thing comes out of this worrisome affair, it may be a forced re-examination of classical music's cult of comparison. The explosion of information produced by the long-playing record and the compact disc is of infinite value, but with it has come a new and, for me, unsettling way of listening.</p>
        <p>My latest information on the BMG ruckus comes from a summary report in the front pages of a new magazine, International Record Review. Thumbing through its subsequent pages, one discovers potential contributors to the problems the front of the magazine reports on.</p>
        <p>I am in awe of these writers as they juggle 50 years or more of recorded history, weighing the sound of versions A to Y against version Z, noting timings, bristling at cuts in the score or failures to make them. The knowledge of past performances and the energy with which it is pursued paints pictures for me of people at home in the midst of vast electrical apparatuses -- stopwatch in one hand, urtext in the other -- endlessly crisscrossing between the Mengelberg and the Furtwangler tempo, or the Heifitz and the Elman rubato.</p>
        <p>WHAT a horrifying way to listen to music. Necessary, perhaps, in that publications like this are a kind of Consumer Reports, aimed at setting the potential buyer on the right course, but horrifying nonetheless. I also suspect that the erudite justifications for opinions arrived at are in fact unwitting responses to personal instinct. And why shouldn't they be? Neither critics nor the performers we write about are persuaded in the end by scholarly proof; we manipulate proofs to accommodate what is in our hearts, and that was often fixed inside us by our earliest experiences.</p>
        <p>Comparison, of course, is part of the process. Every new thing that enters our heads collides with what is already there. Yet the comparisons bred of 50 recordings of the Beethoven Seventh poison the listening experience. Those who come away from Carnegie Hall grumbling that they heard the Beethoven Seventh conducted at better tempos in 1954 and with better brass playing a few years later have wasted their evening.</p>
        <p>This is a plea not for recorded music, which will find its way, but for the unencumbered ear, cleaned out for every night in the concert hall or in front of the record player. Give your favorite interpretation from the past an evening off. Compare as little as you can. Make this experience as new as possible. If we don't get back to hearing freshly, we shall soon find ourselves never hearing the Beethoven Seventh Symphony again, only performances of it.</p>
