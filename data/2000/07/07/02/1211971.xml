        <p>The past hangs heavy over Mexico's people and politics, but rarely has a moment seemed so pregnant with history as the presidential balloting scheduled for Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mexicans will choose either to vote in an opposition candidate for the first time since the Mexican revolution or, in an outcome that would be almost as extraordinary, to inaugurate a new century by freely electing the very party that dominated most of the last.</p>
        <p>Either result would usher in a period of some uncertainty. The leading opposition candidate, Vicente Fox Quesada, pledged to govern with caution if elected, but his victory would shatter an elite tied to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. A new triumph by the party that has won 13 consecutive presidential elections would outrage many in the educated and middle classes, with potentially volatile consequences.</p>
        <p>''Through the decades, the PRI created an atmosphere of eternal victory,'' said Homero Aridjis, a poet and former ambassador. ''But now the opposition has shown that defeat of the official party is possible. Mexico has changed.''</p>
        <p>In the rancorous presidential campaign that culminates with Sunday's balloting, the country abandoned a series of authoritarian traditions stretching back half a century. And in characteristic fashion, even as Mexicans lived a thrilling period of democratic innovation, they often debated their own history as fervently as their strategies for the future.</p>
        <p>''The weight of the past has sometimes been more present than the present itself,'' the author Enrique Krauze once wrote of Mexicans' singular preoccupation with history's legacy, the crucible of conquest and colonialism, reform and revolution that forged their modern outlook.</p>
        <p>That seemed true during much of the campaign, as the major candidates and their supporters restaged Mexico's battles and betrayals. Yet at the end of the grand debate, all Mexico seemed to grasp the momentous nature of the choice at hand.</p>
        <p>''This election is the culmination of struggles, initiatives and sacrifices stretching throughout our entire history,'' Porfirio Munoz Ledo, who ended his candidacy in June to endorse Mr. Fox, thundered last week. ''Never, since we became an independent nation, has power passed peacefully from one party to another through elections. This vote is a watershed.''</p>
        <p>In the balloting, voters will elect a president for a six-year term, 500 congressional deputies, 128 senators, two state governors and the mayor of Mexico City.</p>
        <p>In a final opinion poll published by the newspaper Reforma on June 22, the governing party candidate, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, was favored by 42 percent of voters, Mr. Fox of the center-right National Action Party by 39 percent, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, a leftist candidate, by 16 percent. The margin of error was 3 percent.</p>
        <p>Those results showed how Mexico's opposition forces have grown into a broad majority, but their division between two major candidates could bring a new governing party triumph.</p>
        <p>Mexico has a rich tradition of electoral fraud, but safeguards put in place by the autonomous federal agency organizing the election have greatly reduced the possibility for chicanery. One or more opposition parties are expected to be represented at the vast majority, if not all, of the 113,000 voting places. The government said it had authorized 860 foreigners to visit Mexico to observe the voting. Jimmy Carter is here, as are delegations sent by the Republican and Democratic parties.</p>
        <p>The PRI, founded in 1929 as an alliance of rival factions within the post-revolutionary army, long monopolized Mexican life. During its first decades, the party put the nation's finances on a sound footing, built thousands of schools and clinics, and raised living standards.</p>
        <p>Catholic intellectuals opposed to the land reform and other policies they considered socialist formed the National Action Party, known as the PAN, in 1938, and it has always been the most important opposition party. But it remained a mere sect during its first half century. The governing party has won 13 consecutive presidential elections, usually by sweeping margins and four times by alleged fraud.</p>
        <p>Over the last two decades, amid recurrent economic crises and revelations of party corruption, opposition strength has grown. Even in the last presidential balloting in 1994, however, the party's candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, received nearly twice as many votes as the National Action Party nominee, who came in second.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fox has mounted the opposition's fiercest assault, galvanizing support among millions of voters beyond his own party. Announcing his candidacy three years ago, he rewrote the political calendar in which no campaigning ever began before the sitting president had hand-picked his successor. His audacity forced Mr. Zedillo and his party to organize the PRI's first presidential primary, holding candidate debates and placing new emphasis on television.</p>
        <p>''Win or lose, Fox has changed Mexican politics forever,'' said Federico Estevez, a political scientist. ''His candidacy forced the ruling party to open up the process, bringing elite politics down to the level of the masses. That's a huge change.''</p>
        <p>But in a campaign that moved Mexicans toward a more modern presidential succession, the candidates often invited them to look over their shoulder, drawing contemporary lessons from past struggles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox, for instance, often dresses like an American cowboy, and his mother was born in Spain. In television advertisements, Mr. Labastida stoked Mexicans' lingering bitterness over the Spanish conquest and an 1847 American invasion in which Mexico lost territories from Texas through California, deriding Mr. Fox as a man with foreign roots and treasonous tendencies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Labastida reached back across 65 years of history to portray himself as an heir to President Lazaro Cardenas del Rio, Cuauhtemoc's father, who ruled with great popularity during the 1930's.</p>
        <p>''Who created our Social Security system?'' Mr. Labastida bellowed during a rally the other day. ''Who expropriated the petroleum? Was it a Martian, the PAN or was it one of our PRI presidents?''</p>
        <p>In recent months, Mr. Labastida cranked up his party's machinery, enlisting 21 PRI state governors and a string of his party's hoariest leaders, men associated with illicit fortunes and election fraud. They carried out a nationwide campaign to dispense taxpayer-financed giveaways to poor voters, often in exchange for written vote pledges.</p>
        <p>Those tactics may have helped Mr. Fox to persuade some undecided voters to adopt his reading of the recent past as one of PRI governments' acting as corrupt stewards while workers' real income plummeted.</p>
        <p>''Mexicans have been the great losers of the 20th century,'' Mr. Fox said in a televised debate in April.</p>
        <p>Weeks later, in another broadcast encounter with his rivals, he portrayed himself as the champion of Mexico's democratic movement, which has built since the 1970's.</p>
        <p>''The road has been long and difficult,'' Mr. Fox said. ''We're arriving at our goal, thanks to millions of Mexicans who have confronted PRI authoritarianism.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox's campaign to draw votes from across the political spectrum seemed to be snowballing until May, when a letter in which Mr. Fox courted the support of the Roman Catholic bishops stirred anticlerical animosities dating from the Inquisition.</p>
        <p>Distrust of the church smolders because of its often exploitative role during colonial rule; it was the largest banker until 19th-century reform laws expropriated ecclesiastical properties. Every president since Benito Juarez has come from a party with a strong anticlerical streak. Mr. Fox, in contrast, is an unapologetically devout Catholic.</p>
        <p>''If Fox wins, it will be the first time a party linked to the church has assumed power in Mexico since the 1850's,'' said Friedrich Katz, a historian at the University of Chicago.</p>
        <p>But the greatest obstacle to Mr. Fox's attempt to unite the opposition against the PRI was Mr. Cardenas, who broke with his father's party in 1987 and lost his own presidential challenge the next year, many believe through fraud. He finished last among the major candidates in 1994.</p>
        <p>Prominent intellectuals sought to negotiate an alliance between Mr. Fox and Mr. Cardenas last fall, but the effort collapsed because neither man would relinquish his candidacy. Mr. Fox has since insisted that a vote for Mr. Cardenas is a vote wasted.</p>
        <p>That argument posed a powerful quandary for the left. Some from Mr. Cardenas's party, and even a handful of former Communists, endorsed Mr. Fox, declaring that since the fall of the Berlin Wall their desire to oust the governing party had come to outweigh ideological considerations.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cardenas and most of his supporters spurned Mr. Fox's unity pleas. Some cited Mr. Fox's 1996 proposal to privatize Pemex, the state-owned oil company, an icon of Mexican nationalism since President Cardenas expropriated the oil fields from Standard Oil in 1938.</p>
        <p>Others looked further back, across centuries, to conclude that despite their current disgust with corruption, they have more in common with the PRI than with Mr. Fox and his conservative associates.</p>
        <p>In a final campaign speech, Amalia Garcia, the historian who is the president of Mr. Cardenas's party, outlined Mexico's national development as a struggle between conservative traitors like Mr. Fox and a line of heroic, modernizing leaders including Benito Juarez, President Cardenas and his son.</p>
        <p>''Since the dawn of our independence, our nation has been in conflict over two great visions,'' Ms. Garcia said. ''We're living the same historic dispute again today.''</p>
