      <block class="full_text">
        <p>IT isn't easy to become a Jew in Westchester.</p>
        <p>According to Jewish tradition, converts must be immersed in the mikvah, a ritual bath built according to strict Talmudic standards.</p>
        <p>And though there is at least one mikvah in the county -- at Young Israel of Scarsdale -- it is not open for conversion.</p>
        <p>''Any rabbi who wanted to officiate at a conversion was going to Riverdale or Stamford to use the mikva'ot run by Orthodox congregations there,'' said Rabbi Gordon Tucker of Temple Israel, a Conservative congregation in White Plains.</p>
        <p>But that is about to change: Rabbi Tucker's congregation is building its own mikvah, which should be completed in the fall. Situated in a room adjoining the main synagogue, the mikvah will be a circular pool, eight feet in diameter, with steps leading down to a floor which has a deeper pit where taller people can stand so they are fully immersed. It will cost $100,000 and will be available to Westchester Jews for conversions and for the variety of purification rituals for which mikva'ot (the plural of mikvah) have been used for centuries.</p>
        <p>The mere fact of a Conservative congregation's building a mikvah is unusual. Jews from liberal branches of Judaism often regard the mikvah with deep suspicion, because its primary purpose among the Orthodox is for women to ritually purify themselves after menstruation -- a rite that some see as sexist or even misogynist. Few members of the Conservative and Reform movements maintain this tradition.</p>
        <p>For their part, Orthodox rabbis have increasingly refused to allow non-Orthodox conversions in their mikva'ot in recent years. This has been particularly true in Israel, where the Orthodox community has questioned the legitimacy of the Conservative and Reform traditions. But it happens in this country, too.</p>
        <p>Partly for that reason, Conservative congregations are building their own mikva'ot in greater numbers, said Rabbi Jerome Epstein, the chief executive of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, which represents about 800 conservative congregations in the United States and Canada.</p>
        <p>''It is also becoming a real interest, outside the conversion issue,'' Rabbi Epstein said. ''Some are seeking to go to the mikvah on a regular basis, and some for special occasions -- prior to a wedding, after childbirth, before a special holiday.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Tucker said he planned to encourage the newer and more creative uses of the mikvah as well as the traditional ones. People might want to go to the mikvah after a divorce, he said, to signify their rebirth into the community. Women might want to use it, he said, after an unwanted pregnancy, or a stillbirth or miscarriage.</p>
        <p>There is nothing in the Jewish law about any of these uses, he said, but they fit in with the mikvah's historic role.</p>
        <p>''It was created as a rebirth ritual,'' Rabbi Tucker said. ''It goes back to an ancient Jewish idea, wanting to feel a sense of renewal and purity.''</p>
        <p>Dr. David Elcott, an author and lecturer on Judaism, said the new popularity of mikva'ot is part of a trend toward more ritual among Reform and Conservative Jews. ''You're seeing a radical change taking place, and this is part of that.''</p>
        <p>The mikvah will probably be a new experience for most Temple Israel members, said Robin Friedman, a congregant from White Plains. ''It's shrouded in mystery, and some of that is negative,'' she said. ''Maybe we can open it up and change people's views.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Tucker said he had never been denied the use of a mikvah. His congregation chose to build its own, he said, because ''there is an educational value in seeing the ritual of entry into the Jewish faith.''</p>
        <p>There is also the issue of convenience. Rabbi Tucker travels to other mivka'ot to officiate at conversions 10 or 12 times a year, he said, and other Westchester rabbis do the same. He expects many of them to start using the new mikvah.</p>
        <p>The mikvah plays a particularly important role in conversion, said Rabbi Michael Paley, executive director of synagogue and community affairs at the UJA-Federation of New York, because Judaism has traditionally been defined by a sense of belonging and obligation -- not faith, as in Christianity. ''The minimum for being a Jew is generally biological. So the conversion ritual has to be a re-birthing.''</p>
        <p>First mention of mikvah'ot dates back to the Torah, which calls for ritual immersion in ''living waters'' before entering holy precincts or after coming into contact with the dead or other causes of impurity. The regulations governing the construction of mikva'ot date back to the Talmudic period. The water must be natural water and it cannot be transported by hand.</p>
        <p>Because fresh water was scarce in ancient Israel, the rabbis ruled that a mikvah is valid if its main supply mixes with fresh water. Most modern mikva'ot use chlorinated water as their main supply, with a communicating tube to a smaller container of rain water, which is turned on just before someone enters the pool.</p>
        <p>User fees for the mikvah have not been set, but fees at other mikvah'ot tend to be about $50 for conversions and $10 for each regular use. The mikvah is likely to be managed by a committee of lay people.</p>
        <p>During the conversion ceremony, as it will be practiced at Temple Israel, a three-person rabbinic court stands above the convert (or in the next room, if it is the opposite sex) and listens for a splash. The convert -- who has already undergone an interview with the court to test his or her commitment -- then recites a prayer and immerses himself or herself two more times before being declared a full member of the faith.</p>
