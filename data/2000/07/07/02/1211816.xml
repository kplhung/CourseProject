        <p>THERE have been many incarnations of Sally Bowles, Christopher Isherwood's divinely decadent ''Berlin Stories'' heroine, and Liza Minnelli didn't seem the most logical choice to play her. But Ms. Minnelli proved her critics dead wrong about that in Bob Fosse's brilliant film version of CABARET (1972) and won an Oscar for her efforts. Joel Grey did the same, as the sexually ambiguous emcee of the Kit Kat Klub, where everything is beatiful - or pretends to be, as Nazi swastikas appear and begin to change Germany forever. Michael York is Sally's bisexual love interest, Marisa Berenson is his innocent Jewish student, and Kander and Ebb's music is as heartbreaking as ever - Saturday at 9 p.m. and Saturday/Early Sunday at 2 a.m. on Romance Classics.</p>

        <p>In his New York Times review, Bosley Crowther called it an ''obviously low-budget job,'' referring to the shocks as just ''old-fashioned and melodramatics, however effective and sure.'' At least, he allowed, ''the acting is fair.'' Despite Crowther's low opinion of it, PSYCHO (1960) is now considered Hitchcock's masterpiece. Anthony Perkins's portrayal of Norman Bates, the jittery mama's-boy manager of the dreary Bates Motel, typecast him for life, but it's fascinting cinema history, as is Janet Leigh's scary shower scene and every shot of the creepy Victorian mansion out back - Sunday at 8 p.m on AMC.</p>
        <p>Five years after ''Citien Kane,'' Orson Welles made THE STRANGER (1946), a terrific, atmospheric suspense drama about a Nazi war criminal (Welles) posing as a college professor in a sunny little Connecticut town. Edward G. Robinson is wonderfully single-minded as the federal agent out to unmask him. Loretta Young gets the best lighting as the professor's new wife, who refuses to suspect a thing, even after he kills her dog - Sunday at 8 p.m. on Channel 55.</p>
        <p>Write about what you know, they say. So Kevin Smith, a former Quick Stop employee, created CLERKS (1994), a bleak day in the life of a New Jersey convenience store and the video store next door. Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson play the title roles. Expect irreverence; this is a film that makes necrophilia in a public bathroom funny - Tuesday at 9:45 p.m. and Tuesday/Early Wednesday at 1:30 a.m. on IFC.</p>
        <p>The restaurateur brothers (Stanley Tucci and Tony Shalhoub) in Mr. Tucci and Campbell Scott's BIG NIGHT (1996) are a lot more dedicated to their careers. Despite that, their Italian restaurant is on the verge of closing. Now they're going for broke: they'll make a fantastic dinner for Louis Prima and his band (the film is set in the 1950's), and the evening will either make their reputation or they'll call it quits. ''Babette's Feast'' fans will be happy - Saturday at 6 p.m. on Lifetime.</p>
        <p>Geraldine Page is eloquently sad as a fading beauty and has-been actress in SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH (1962), Richard Brooks's take on Tennessee Williams's story about a lost weekend on Florida's Gulf Coast. Paul Newman is painfully needy as her companion, Chance Wayne, struggling, youngish would-be actor who has been struggling just a little to long. Ed Begley won the best supporting actor Oscar as Boss Finley, a local politician who will go to frightening lengths to keep his oddly named daughter, Heavenly (Shirley Knight), away from Chance. Hollywood's concept of age is always interesting: Mr. Newman was 37 when the film was released; Ms. Page was 38 - Wednesday at 6 p.m. on TCM.</p>
