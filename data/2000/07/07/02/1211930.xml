        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am concerned over your coverage of the surreptitious pasting of Margery Cohen's art in the advertisement spaces of the 181st Street subway station (Neighborhood Report, June 4 and June 11).</p>
        <p>The work was applied with a strong adhesive over the entire length of the uptown and downtown platforms. Her acts were illegal. She asked for a permit and it was denied. So she got a permit to videotape the installation of the artwork she was denied a permit to install.</p>

        <p>I am concerned over your coverage of the surreptitious pasting of Margery Cohen's art in the advertisement spaces of the 181st Street subway station (Neighborhood Report, June 4 and June 11).</p>
        <p>The work was applied with a strong adhesive over the entire length of the uptown and downtown platforms. Her acts were illegal. She asked for a permit and it was denied. So she got a permit to videotape the installation of the artwork she was denied a permit to install.</p>
        <p>She and her posse of a dozen friends and relatives should be fined for littering and also be made to pay for the removal of the artwork. The removal left the freshly painted advertisement spaces much worse for wear because the adhesive pulled away some of the paint. Any proceeds she may get from selling the videotape should be given to the M.T.A.</p>
