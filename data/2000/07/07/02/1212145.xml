        <p>THE book is called ''Kein' Angst, Baby!'' (''Don't Worry, Kid!''), and it has a voluptuous Valkyrie sizzling on the cover. Written for opera singers by opera singers and first published in 1992 by the New York Opera Newsletter, it is a guide to auditioning in Germany. American singers long regarded the German audition tour as a useful -- indeed, essential -- career move, and this book helped the uninitiated negotiate everything from writing a letter to a German agent to dealing with German telephones and money matters.</p>
        <p>But things have changed. International telephoning and banking have been facilitated by calling cards and automated tellers. German theaters are not hiring singers as they used to. And both of the authors of ''Kein' Angst, Baby!,'' Dorothy Maddison and Gail Sullivan, are back, training in the United States.</p>
        <p>''The hegemony of the American singer in Germany is over,'' said Peter Russell, the director of the Young Artist Development Program at the Metropolitan Opera.</p>
        <p>There are no official statistics on the numbers of American singers who used to go to Germany for the fall audition season. But in the mid-1980's it was reported to have been a couple of thousand.</p>
        <p>The promise of steady work was a powerful lure. More opera is performed in the German-speaking world on any given night than in the entire rest of the world. The former West Germany had more than 80 opera houses, supported by state subsidies. Each employed its own singers, who received year-round salaries (with an extra month's pay as a Christmas bonus), four to six weeks of vacation and full benefits.</p>
        <p>In America, by contrast, work was and is irregular. ''In the States, most of the companies still do four productions a year, and they do that production four times,'' said Pamela Rosenberg, the artistic director of the Stuttgart Opera, who is to become the general manager of the San Francisco Opera next year. In Germany, most houses adopted the repertory system, playing a different work from one night to the next, like the Met. But the average German house has a far longer season than the Met, with its seven and a half months, the longest season of any opera house in America. No company in the United States can give a singer a full-time job.</p>
        <p>German theater directors, moreover, have a decided prejudice in favor of American-trained singers, who arrive with a level of stage experience that most German conservatories don't offer. ''The training is absolutely better,'' said Klaus Schulz, director of the Stadttheater am Gartnerplatz in Munich, who makes regular trips to America to scout new talent.</p>
        <p>And the results of this preference are still in evidence. ''Every German opera house still has about 50 percent Americans,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''They'd have to shut every house in Germany if Americans didn't come.''</p>
        <p>Yet the picture has gradually been changing. In the 1960's, ''If you could speak some German and sing all right, you could probably get a job,'' said Frederic Mayer, a retired tenor. But by the 1980's it was a lot harder to get a foot in the door. Mr. Mayer, who sang in the ensemble at Gartnerplatz for more than 30 years, was also choir director at the English-speaking Church of the Ascension in Munich, which was an unofficial meeting place for auditioning singers. (It is recommended in ''Kein' Angst, Baby!'')</p>
        <p>''I see quite a few kids coming through and auditioning, but not masses, the way we used to in the 80's,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''Where we used to get 15 or 20 new singers every year, I probably see 3.''</p>
        <p>There are a couple of reasons for the falloff in young Americans. One is the opening of the former Soviet Union in the early 1990's, which released a huge wave of eager young singers from Eastern Europe who were willing to work for a lot less money than anyone else.</p>
        <p>''In the first five years, one could get the East bloc singers strikingly cheap,'' said Mr. Schulz of the Gartnerplatz. Even today, the Vienna State Opera has been known to alternate a highly paid superstar soprano in the same role with a young Eastern European singer who receives a mere fraction of the better-known singer's salary.</p>
        <p>At the entry level, the pay may not be as much an issue. ''Americans will also sing for not much money,'' said Inge Tennigkeit, an opera agent in Dusseldorf. ''They'll also sing in small theaters.''</p>
        <p>Still, there is no question that the Eastern Europeans have changed the playing field. ''I hear fewer Americans, because I can only hear 25 or 30 people, maximum, at each audition,'' said Karl-Erich Haase of Munich's venerable Stoll agency, who, as all the agents used to do in the 1980's, holds auditions once a week. ''You can only hear so many. And there are more Eastern Europeans now. The middle level of American singer has fewer chances.''</p>
        <p>Then there is German reunification. As the once wealthy nation stretched its resources to cover the costs of five impoverished new states, cultural subsidies suffered, and the budgets of opera houses -- along with those of museums, theaters and dance companies -- were frozen or slashed. A few smaller opera houses had to close. The effects have extended even to such major houses as those in Frankfurt and Hamburg, which have reduced their numbers of performances appreciably.</p>
        <p>With tighter budgets has come a tendency not to replace singers who retire or move to another house. In lieu of the year-round contracts that used to be the norm, theaters have been offering more and more part-time contracts and guest stints. From 1990 to 1997, the number of singers employed in German ensembles fell by about 20 percent. People who have ensemble jobs have tended to keep them, so there are fewer jobs free for incoming singers.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, as Germany tightens its belt, the American opera scene is expanding as never before: another reason fewer singers are crossing the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Of the 114 professional opera companies registered with the service organization Opera America, Mark Scorca, the group's president, reports, half have started since 1970. And 70 companies have some sort of training program. In the three years since its inception, Opera America's singer services program has grown threefold, to more than 1,300 members. ''I think it's much easier for American singers to make careers without going to Europe,'' said Diana Hossack, who directs singer services.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russell, of the Met's young artist program, elaborated: ''What I find frightening is that there are now so many different opportunities for young American singers in the States that a lot of us are vying for the best singers.''</p>
        <p>There are no rules about how to launch a singing career, and there have always been singers who have built fine careers at home. Amy Burton, a soprano who often appears at the New York City Opera, started out singing in regional companies around America.</p>
        <p>''Some years I was traveling 10 months a year,'' she said. ''I was still in the phase of, 'I can't believe they're paying me to sing: I'm having such a good time.' I was learning an amazing amount of repertoire.''</p>
        <p>Later, she sang in Europe but not on a full-time basis and not in Germany. ''I did consider a contract somewhere, and that was never very appealing to me,'' she said. ''I didn't want to live in Germany, for one thing.'' What she has created instead, she added, is ''not only an American career but one of the most New York-based careers that I know.''</p>
        <p>Dean Elzinga, a bass-baritone from California, has also started out along a peripatetic American-based path. ''I'm hardly ever at home,'' he said from a hotel room in Portland, Ore., during a recent run of ''The Mikado,'' before flying to New York for an acclaimed appearance with the Eos Chamber Orchestra in Peter Maxwell Davies's ''Eight Songs for a Mad King.'' Mr. Elzinga is spending three months at the Glimmerglass Opera, in Cooperstown, N.Y., this summer, after a season that carried him from Arizona to Alberta.</p>
        <p>This kind of nomadic life is fine for some; for others, it is enough to drive them away. ''I was really sick of being a secretary and then flying out to the Fort Lauderdale Opera for $600 and doing the rehearsal period for nothing,'' said Susan Davis Holmes, a soprano. ''Or the Bronx Opera for $350 for three months' work, hoping someone would see me from the New York City Opera. The pitiful thing was that people envied my career. I just couldn't handle the traveling and being uprooted all the time, and the uncertainty and no money. I said: 'I'll go to Germany, and I'll go twice. I'll go into debt. If I don't get a job somewhere, I'm quitting.' ''</p>
        <p>But there are still jobs in Germany, and Ms. Holmes got one. She spent four years in the ensemble of the small theater in Pforzheim, which she describes as ''a factory.'' A notorious risk of the German ensemble system is that singers work so much they wear out their voices; then the theater discards them. ''Once you're in a small house for longer than two years,'' Ms. Holmes said, ''people start not taking you seriously anymore.''</p>
        <p>But she landed an ensemble contract at a larger house, in Freiburg, and she has started making more prestigious guest appearances at theaters like the Stuttgart Opera: a textbook example of a young singer climbing the ensemble ladder. ''I have no interest in going back to the States,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Some young singers in the American opera loop do better financially than Ms. Holmes did in the tough New York market. While some American houses offer more prestige than pay -- Glimmerglass, the Opera Theater of St. Louis or the Virginia Opera, for example -- others are well financed, even in relatively unexpected places like Salt Lake City, New Orleans and Tulsa, Okla.</p>
        <p>''At a lot of regional houses, I expect to make somewhere between $1,000 and $3,000'' per performance, Mr. Elzinga said.</p>
        <p>Both fees and opinions vary. ''You can't make a good living singing only in America,'' said Richard Harrell, the director of the San Francisco Opera Center. ''The fees just aren't high enough.'' At the same time, Ms. Rosenberg, struggling to hire singers in Stuttgart, is shocked to learn that the Tulsa Opera, in a production of ''Aida,'' offers its Amneris $6,000 a night. ''We pay much less than they pay in the States,'' she said.</p>
        <p>And she labors under another disadvantage, because a change in German laws has driven taxes, even for foreign artists, so high that given a comparable choice they prefer to sing elsewhere. ''It's tougher for us to get a certain level of American singers to commit,'' she said. In recent months, the strong dollar has only contributed to the problem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Elzinga said that when he recently auditioned for London agents who might represent him in Europe, he was told that German fees had declined. ''You have less money to take home. But there are still really important houses and artists there if you can survive on what they pay you.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, plenty of people would still recommend a stint in Germany. ''I say to every American singer that they should get themselves over here and get a house position,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''You will do a role 20 or 30 times. You will be working at your profession much more.''</p>
        <p>EVEN Mr. Harrell, based in San Francisco, emphasizes that opera ''is essentially a European art form performed in European languages.''</p>
        <p>''It's important for someone who's going to make a career of it to go and spend some time there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Americans getting jobs in Germany now seem to be coming in at a higher level of professionalism. ''Many Americans come over with managers now,'' said Mr. Haase of the Stoll agency. ''It's easier for me when I simply talk to an agent and he brings me 10 good people.''</p>
        <p>But at least one agent feels that the overall level of Americans has declined drastically. ''First, not so many Americans are coming,'' Ms. Tennigkeit said. ''Second, they're not as well trained. The singers present themselves well, but in terms of pure vocal technique, they don't compare to those 10 years ago. The difference is absolutely blatant. Today, they're often the ones who have sung for a couple of years in America, and it didn't work over there, so they thought they'd try it in Germany.''</p>
        <p>In America, by contrast, Mr. Harrell, who hears some 600 entry-level singers a year, says that ''the people I'm hearing are getting better: better trained, more high-quality singers.'' Even allowing for personal tastes, one could infer, from these contrasting opinions, that young American talent today is more likely to audition for the San Francisco program than for a German agent.</p>
        <p>For those who do find work in the German-speaking world, it is an open question exactly what that contract translates into in terms of a larger career. Mr. Elzinga spent seven months at the Vienna Volksoper doing major roles: Escamillo in ''Carmen,'' Figaro in ''Le Nozze di Figaro,'' Mephistopheles in ''Faust.''</p>
        <p>''I thought it would lead to something, but it didn't,'' Mr. Elzinga said. ''I know a woman who worked in Germany for a long time who said it was quite a struggle to come back. She'd been out of the loop. If you're at the important but not star level in Europe and you want to break into the States, it's hard.''</p>
        <p>Just how hard, no one knows better than Ms. Sullivan and Ms. Maddison, who wrote ''Kein' Angst, Baby!'' in 1990. Although each of them landed a contract in the former East Germany, both are back in the United States. Ms. Maddison is finishing doctoral work at the University of Arizona; Ms. Sullivan is working a day job, living in Inwood, which she calls ''the diva ghetto,'' and still trying to break into the opera scene. Her next project is a tour in Abu Dhabi.</p>
        <p>She is not a big fan of Germany.</p>
        <p>''My advice to young singers would be to try all the young artists' programs in the United States first, unless they are sure they want to live abroad,'' she said. ''Even though it's a smaller world than it used to be, it's a very different culture. People need to think they're probably not going to start out in Munich or Berlin. They're going to start out in Erfurt. There you are, staring at your walls when you don't have rehearsal. They need to think about it instead of blindly running off because it's what everyone does. It's not what everyone does anymore.</p>
        <p>''It's not like 20 years ago, when you went to Europe and got trained and came back here and had a career. Today, you go to Germany, and you stay in Germany. When you come back, your European background doesn't mean a thing.''</p>
