        <p>Kevin Bacon has quite a resume: star of such hit films as ''Footloose,'' ''Diner,'' ''JFK'' and ''Apollo 13,'' subject of a popular trivia game (The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon) and now, rock star.</p>
        <p>Kevin and his brother, Michael, an Emmy award-winning musician, front a rock band that mixes diverse influences from country to soul, and have released two albums to good reviews.</p>
        <p>That is surprising -- at least to those who suspected that the Bacon Brothers would be a vanity outfit, stroking the ego of a big-time actor who had nothing better to do. What critics found, instead, were siblings who grew up singing together and  are now creating grown-up melodic songs featuring rich harmonies and expert musicianship.</p>
        <p>''We knew there would be a certain amount of eye-rolling going on,'' said Kevin Bacon, a few days before the band's latest New Jersey tour stop. ''It was inevitable. But the fact was we always played together. And we figured, look at the upside, people will come to the show because of the celebrity aspect, and then they'll hear great music and we've made a new fan. And that's just what happened.''</p>
        <p>The brothers believe that they share many qualities, like innate musicality, but that their differences make their music so appealing: Kevin's enormous energy, and Michael's intense restraint. Michael, who has made a living scoring music for television and film (he won his Emmy for the score to a 1993 documentary, ''The Kennedys''), calls Kevin the aggressive singer, the romantic, and refers to himself as more in the background, controlled.</p>
        <p>Michael views their audience asjaded music fans, like himself, who are not dying to hear the latest and greatest. ''They have to be drawn into something new,'' he said. ''They're a little disenfranchised.  They like to hear songs of a personal nature with universal appeal.''</p>
        <p>The two brothers, both married with children, like to write about their families and they feel people identify with that. Their music fits in well with the sudden rise of radio stations that play an adult-album-alternative format, or Triple A.</p>
        <p>Right now, Kevin is very happy to see males filling the seats in clubs  they play. ''I know we're devastatingly handsome and women flock to us,'' he joked, ''but the truth is our audiences were predominately women. Now we're finally getting to see guys sitting there knowing the music and singing along.''</p>
        <p>And their cultish audience? ''Oh, I can relate to that,'' said Kevin. ''It was like when I was a kid growing up in Philadelphia and being into a local guy like Bruce Springsteen when he was starting out. And suddenly he's on the cover of Time and Newsweek, and I'm like, 'Oh, please. He's our boy.' It's that fun feeling you get about being into something the rest of the world doesn't really know about.''</p>
        <p>When asked if writing songs and recording was the life of leisure, the  brothers groan. ''This is not easy work,'' said Michael. ''Sometimes it's like wringing blood from a stone. Plus the studio is not a comfortable place for me.''</p>
        <p>But no one has complaints about  performing live. The brothers structure their shows according to the type of place they are performing. Kevin said their shows ran the gamut of drunken bar music in  dives with mechanical bulls to more sedate performances at beautiful old theaters. But sedate for these two doesn't necessarily mean white gloves and solemn tones. They rock out, and their obvious influences -- James Taylor and Crosby Stills and Nash -- mesh well with the brothers' own musical sensibility.</p>
        <p>One song they promise to perform this Saturday is a cut from ''Getting There,'' a searing cover of Tom Waits's ''Jersey Girl.'' ''We play that every time we play New Jersey,'' Kevin said.</p>
        <p>If he had his choice, Kevin said, he would prefer a Grammy over an Oscar. ''Music is the most personal kind of expression you can get,'' he said. ''There's a lot of vulnerability being an actor. There are a lot of people involved controlling the product in a movie. A lot of times you feel like a puppet. ''With songs, we write about things that happen to us.''</p>
        <p>One of those special moments is when people react to a specific song, both brothers say, as one recent woman did to Kevin's song ''Angelina.'' ''She talked about the song helping her,'' Kevin said. ''That's an amazing reaction to music.''</p>
        <p>The brothers are working on a third record, and Kevin is promoting a summer film, ''Hollow Man.''</p>
        <p>The Bacon Brothers are currently letting loose with a six-piece band made up experienced musicians. But size doesn't matter to Michael, as he said: ''We just want people to  feel like they're sitting around a living room and we're entertaining them.''</p>
