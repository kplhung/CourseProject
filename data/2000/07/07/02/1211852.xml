        <p>FOR the stirring announcement that scientists have more or less succeeded in mapping the human genome, the private sector deserves a lot of the credit. The energy and innovation of one company, the Celera Genomics Group, a unit of the PE Corporation, transformed a plodding effort run by a public consortium into a feverish race. The job got done faster than expected, and lives may be saved.</p>
        <p>But another important conclusion must be drawn from this milestone, one that is crucial to business people lately inured to such heresy. It is that Uncle Sam is not the consummate bumbler he's made out to be.</p>
        <p>Forget all that stuff about Washington's irrelevance and ineptitude, slumbering bureaucrats and leaden regulations. The United States government is very good at some things, and directing the consortium that did this great deed has proved to be one of them.</p>
        <p>That this is news testifies to the apotheosis of private enterprise in our age. To hear people talk, you'd never know it, but the federal government has played a vital role at almost every important juncture in the nation's economic development. When it has erred, it has mainly been by bending over too far backward for the private sector.</p>
        <p>Washington didn't build the great railroads, but it did secure the continent and donate the land that made them pay. To the extent that the atom has been harnessed (and despite all that no-nukes business, it's been harnessed plenty), Uncle Sam's role was central, from the Manhattan Project to manufacturing nuclear fuel. The G.I. Bill helped create the graduates -- and the universities -- that fuel a modern technological economy. And the Interstate System of highways opened up the suburbs, for better or worse.</p>
        <p>Even the Internet, this transforming technology, this spawner of endless cant about the heroism of entrepreneurship, was cooked up by Washington bureaucrats to connect far-flung universities working on military projects.</p>
        <p>And now our genes.</p>
        <p>Did Celera play an important role? Sure. It brought to bear all the hallmarks of its breed: it was nimble, smart, innovative and daring. It did things faster and cheaper. And it had the benefit of its rival's data: The government-sponsored Human Genome Project posted its results on (there it is again) the Internet, where Celera could use it to check its own work and to bridge gaps.</p>
        <p>Now that the human genome is more or less cracked, the great puzzle is why so many Americans in business seem to think their government is good for nothing but squandering tax money. I think it is because Uncle Sam, feeling his postwar oats, dove into a series of quixotic battles that were better left unfought. The war on drugs, after all, is no more successful than the war in Vietnam or the war on poverty (though civil rights legislation has surely helped on that front). Covert intervention overseas, Watergate, the savings and loan debacle, partisan paralysis in Congress -- at every turn, it seems, our kinsman by the Potomac has worked hard to waste his accumulation of midcentury good will.  ON top of that, government by nature tends to monopolize things, and the evils of monopoly have never been more apparent. Competition works: FedEx and the United Parcel Service have surely forced the Postal Service to do better, and the mere threat of vouchers has improved many a public school. Celera's aggressive approach lit a fire under the government-backed consortium, and we are all better off for it.</p>
        <p>Yet the idea that government can't -- or shouldn't -- do anything is hubristic nonsense, and was recognized as such by no less than Adam Smith. If Washington is smart (stop laughing), it will both learn from and build on its genome success -- redirect farm subsidies into agricultural research, say, or expose Amtrak to competition from private passenger services, or use people's natural self-interest to construct a universal health insurance plan with built-in incentives to hold down costs.</p>
        <p>The trick is being sensible, not dogmatic,  about which things government can do and which it should leave to business. With the genome project, at least, Uncle Sam reminded us that he is capable of being more than just an expensive umpire.</p>
