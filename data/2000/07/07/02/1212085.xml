        <p>THE GOOSE IS LOOSE</p>
        <p>By Richard (Goose) Gossage</p>
        <p>with Russ Pate.</p>
        <p>Ballantine, $25.</p>
        <p>Richard Edward Gossage knew when he was 8 years old that he would become a baseball player: ''I had discovered I could throw harder and farther than any other kids my age.'' On April 15, 1972, Gossage, a rookie on the Chicago White Sox, heard the pitching coach say, ''Get Gossage up.'' ''There I stood, quivering, a 6-foot-3, 20-year-old rookie. . . . I was nave, innocent and as green as an unripe banana.'' In a meandering, anecdotal autobiography, written with Russ Pate, Gossage recalls his 22 years as a relief pitcher, first for the White Sox, then the Pittsburgh Pirates, Yankees, San Diego Padres, Seattle Mariners and, briefly, the Chicago Cubs. (He also played for a summer on a Japanese team.) He appeared in 1,002 games, recorded 108 winning games in relief -- third-best in baseball history -- and saved 310 games, also third-best. He also talks of games he lost. Pitching for the Padres against the Detroit Tigers in the last game of the 1983 World Series, with the Padres two games behind, Gossage, against the orders of his manager, Dick Williams, did not walk Kirk Gibson. ''On the second pitch -- WHAM! . . . Gibson sent a thunderous blast into the upper deck. . . . The World Series was history.'' Gossage pitched his final game, and was credited with a save, on Aug. 8, 1994. Gossage also writes about his wife, their three sons, colleagues he admired (or did not) and shenanigans players conjured up both on and off the field. His prose can be crude, but he is painfully honest about his role in a game the chosen few play.</p>
