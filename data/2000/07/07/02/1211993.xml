        <p>The advertisements, in stark black and white, began appearing in newspapers and on Web sites last month. ''Four out of five fourth graders in our city's most challenged schools fail to meet state standards in reading and writing,'' they said. ''Are you willing to do something about it?''</p>
        <p>With that blunt appeal, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy hopes to persuade New Yorkers to drop whatever jobs they are doing and teach in New York City's most troubled schools this fall. All college graduates with at least a 3.0 grade point average can apply, no matter how sparse their teaching experience and credentials.</p>
        <p>This month, Mr. Levy will choose 250 of the applicants -- who so far include bankers, lawyers, social workers, a speech writer, an acupuncturist, a zoo keeper and a judge -- to join a new program called New York City Teaching Fellows. The new teachers will work in failing schools starting this fall, earning the starting salary of $31,910, and the city will pay for them to get master's degrees in education and provide other support.</p>
        <p>Though the program is similar to Teach for America, the national organization that places recent college graduates in urban schools, it is aimed at slightly older people, who have been working for at least several years. Most of the applicants have already tried at least one career.</p>
        <p>''We are aiming for people who may have decided the job they are doing is not spiritually satisfying,'' Mr. Levy said. ''We are drawing in some extraordinarily gifted applicants, and it will be a great challenge to see whether we can keep them in the system and get their enthusiasm to be infectious.''</p>
        <p>Nearly 400 people have applied so far, a number that board officials say is promising considering that they began publicizing the program only two weeks ago. The board is hoping to select the 250 fellows by the end of July and to put them through a rigorous one-month training session (board officials call it boot camp) in August.</p>
        <p>The immediate goal is to help the city meet a new state requirement that only certified teachers work in failing schools, known as schools under registration review. Last year, New York City violated the requirement by hiring nearly 600 uncertified teachers to work in its 99 failing schools when it could not find enough certified teachers.</p>
        <p>Although the teaching fellows would be uncertified at first, they would complete the required coursework at the City University of New York over the next two years, a plan that Mr. Levy hopes will be acceptable to the State Board of Regents.</p>
        <p>The program is also a test of sorts for a larger effort to recruit people from other fields to teach in all 1,100 city schools. The Regents are to vote later this summer on whether to allow such programs in districts statewide.</p>
        <p>If the teaching fellows program works, it might be the model for a permanent ''alternate route'' program for New York City teachers. But the board is also considering other possibilities, like training prospective teachers itself instead of having them take courses at City University.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said he wanted to lure teachers from other professions mostly because the state's education schools were not turning out nearly enough teachers to meet the city's needs. For this school year alone, the Board of Education hired 9,000 new teachers, 60 percent of whom were uncertified.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levy also said he believed that ambitious, talented people from other fields could be an asset to the school system and bring fresh ideas. ''The challenge,'' he said, ''will be getting our act together enough to support these people once they're in the system instead of leaving them out in the cold.''</p>
        <p>The board plans to spend about $4 million on the program in the coming school year, most of which will cover the cost of graduate courses for the new teachers. The board has also hired the New Teacher Project, a consulting group affiliated with Teach for America, to help advertise the program, select the fellows and give them adequate support during the school year.</p>
        <p>''These folks know how to bring in talented people, how to keep them enthusiastic, how to train them to do a good job in the classroom,'' Mr. Levy said. ''We need their help because, with the best intentions, the system currently does every conceivable thing to make it difficult for them to succeed.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the 99 failing schools where the teaching fellows will be working -- mostly in Brooklyn and the Bronx -- have the highest teacher turnover rates in the city. Young, inexperienced teachers are the most likely to leave, frustrated by the lack of resources and guidance, the intense pressure to improve student performance and the daunting array of problems that their students bring to school.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said the teaching fellows' situation would be different because they would have constant support. Taking a cue from Teach for America, the program will provide each teaching fellow with a mentor -- possibly a senior teacher, although such arrangements have had only limited success in the past. Teachers from City University would periodically observe each fellow on the job. And all 250 fellows would meet every few months to discuss their experiences and offer advice.</p>
        <p>The New Teacher Project was responsible for the eye-catching advertisements for the fellows program and made sure that they appeared in places where young professionals were likely to see them: in The New York Times and The Village Voice, for example, and in Time Out, the weekly entertainment magazine. In the coming weeks, the ads will also appear on popular Web sites like Citysearch.com and Zagat .com. In addition, the New Teacher Project is sending mass e-mail messages to college alumni organizations and volunteer groups.</p>
        <p>At an informational session on Wednesday night, about 150 would-be teachers, most in their 20's and 30's, packed into a conference room at McKinsey &amp; Company, a consulting firm on East 53rd Street that donated space for the event. Were the neighborhoods where they would be teaching safe? they wanted to know. Would their classrooms have computers? Would applicants who attended New York City schools have an advantage?</p>
        <p>Robbyn Hasberry, a corporate recruiter, said she recently realized that the business world ''is not my calling.'' Ms. Hasberry, who is black and majored in education at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said part of the reason she wanted to teach in New York City was to help make the city's teaching force more racially diverse.</p>
        <p>Another woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she did not want her employer, a financial services company, to know that she was applying to the program, said she was earning a lot of money -- about three times the $31,900 starting salary for city teachers -- but her job was unfulfilling.</p>
        <p>''You go to an office every day and do these projects and they all start to blur,'' said the woman, who is 35 and lives in Greenwich Village. ''And you start looking for something with more value. I saw the ad and it answered the question, 'What can I do to make the world a better place?' I would be completely remiss to not at least check it out.''</p>
        <p>Several people conceded that they did not know whether they could get by in the city on a teacher's salary, and that it might prevent them from joining the program. But Mr. Levy -- who until recently made more than $500,000 a year as a corporate lawyer and now makes $245,000 as chancellor -- said he believed that the lower pay would not be a major deterrent.</p>
        <p>''More and more people want a sense of satisfaction that what they are doing is important to the larger social order,'' he said. ''This is an opportunity for people with dedication and social conscience and drive to make good on their altruistic impulses.''</p>
