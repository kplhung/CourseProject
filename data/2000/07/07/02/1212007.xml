        <p>A parade of past champions glided across a red carpet during an uplifting ceremony on Center Court today while the missing Pete Sampras sat in a training room with his left shin tethered to an electric stimulator.</p>
        <p>It was 20 minutes before his match, and Sampras was squeezing each second out of his treatment time for tendinitis before facing the dangerous windmill motions of the 6-foot-5-inch Justin Gimelstob. Almost an hour later, a distressed Sampras took a peek at two of the lingering legends perched as spectators in the Royal Box.</p>
        <p>''I looked up and saw Bjorn and the Rocket,'' said Sampras with a tinge of awe when he referred to Bjorn Borg and Rod Laver. ''In that first set, I wasn't too proud that they were watching. They're my idols. So you know who is there. At one point, I wanted to throw my racket up there; and they could play for me.''</p>
        <p>It had been two days since the tendinitis sneaked into his shin, two days since he had felt the court beneath his feet and the racket handle in his hand. For one shaky 24-minute first set, it was as if Sampras were trapped in an awkward meeting with a former flame. He was uncomfortable, disconcerted and timid in his approach to the situation.</p>
        <p>Then the ice was broken.</p>
        <p>Once he understood how much pain there would be, once he found his old rhythm again, Sampras was able to prop himself up with his serve and steady his attack with a series of delicate half-volleys in a 2-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 display of third-round resiliency.</p>
        <p>With the reality of Sampras's march onward in front of him, the animated Gimelstob gamely kept trying. Early in the third set, as he furiously charged forward for a delicate shot by Sampras, it looked as if Gimelstob jackknifed as he skidded to a stop and tumbled over the net cord.</p>
        <p>By the end of the set, he had slipped on the grass, slammed his hand on the lawn, and watched Sampras scamper for a lunging half-volley that cut a perfect angle across the net for a winner.</p>
        <p>All Gimelstob could do was smile in the absurdity of it all. If Sampras did not undo Gimelstob with his touch, he was blowing holes in his confidence with a serve that reached a high of 131 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>''When he came out of his mother's womb, God spent a little extra time on his right shoulder,'' said Gimelstob, a native of Morristown, N.J., who actually served more aces (12) than Sampras (11). ''He just touched it. So that helps. He's got a beautifully smooth action.</p>
        <p>''Have you ever seen him lose when he steps on the court? If you have to think about it, that's pretty good. Doesn't really matter if he's injured. He's a great player.</p>
        <p>''He seems to thrive on playing injured.''</p>
        <p>While Andre Agassi eased by with a straight-sets victory, another of Sampras's challengers, Gustavo Kuerten, did not hold up as well on the sixth day of Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>In need of a shot of Nyquil, a stuffy and achy Kuerten did not have the energy to produce an encore to his French Open title. Kuerten, seeded fourth, was upset by 114th-ranked Alexander Popp, 7-6 (6), 6-2, 6-1, on Court 2, known as the graveyard for elite players at Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>''I have a bad cold for a few days,'' Kuerten said. ''Really got me bad yesterday. Today, I think as the match was going, I feel maybe because I lost first set, too. I didn't feel enough power to see myself with a chance.''</p>
        <p>The seeded women remained on task today. Lindsay Davenport, Venus Williams and Monica Seles all held up to advance to the Round of 16. There was little uncertainty along the way.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere around Sampras was different. He was playing a hard server with great net coverage, but normally Sampras's match against the 99th-ranked player on the tour would not drum up such intrigue. But with Sampras chasing a record-breaking 13th Grand Slam singles title, with a quirky back that has put him face to face with his tennis mortality, the addition of tendinitis to his list of ailments was unsettling to the scene. The first set only added to the drama, albeit temporarily.</p>
        <p>''My racket felt like a foreign object,'' Sampras said. ''It doesn't happen that often.''</p>
        <p>Without practice time for two days, Sampras was testing his pain threshold throughout the first set. Slowly, his reaction time improved. Eventually, he got his footing for some clever returns of serve to break Gimelstob.</p>
        <p>''It's sore, and it will continue to be sore,'' said Sampras, who will play Jonas Bjorkman in the fourth round on Monday. ''I just need to find a way to play on it.''</p>
        <p>To escape one match did not firm up Sampras's belief in his endurance. A week ago, his confidence was in much better shape than it was even after his victory today.</p>
        <p>''I'm still in the tournament,'' Sampras said.</p>
        <p>''I have a day off, and then I play Bjorkman. I'm here to complete the tournament, win or lose. It is what it is.''</p>
        <p>He seemed dispirited more than re-energized. But sometimes with the hangdog Sampras, it is hard to decipher his real mood. There is a sense of determination, though. After all, Kobe Bryant managed. Bryant's ability to play with a sprained ankle in the N.B.A. finals did not escape the notice of Sampras, a Laker season-ticket holder.</p>
        <p>''Playing hurt is something I've learned to deal with,'' Sampras said. ''Everyone, at times in their career, whether it's Kobe Bryant in the finals, plays hurt. I use him as my inspiration. This is Wimbledon.''</p>
        <p>This is where his place in history is greatest. So as Sampras stayed alive in his attempt to break Emerson's record and to tie William Renshaw's mark for most men's titles at Wimbledon (seven), it was fitting that Borg and Laver were witnesses to his chase.</p>
        <p>''I would have loved to have been part of it,'' Sampras said of the parade of champions.</p>
        <p>''I was doing whatever I had to in order to play. It would have been an honor.''</p>
