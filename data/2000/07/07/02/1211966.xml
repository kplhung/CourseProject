        <p>Unable to fix the Cincinnati Reds' primary problem this season, Jim Bowden has embarked on a do-it-yourself plan.</p>
        <p>''I have five boys,'' Bowden said. ''I'm trying to make them all starting pitchers. We have a mound in the backyard and I'm going to make sure they all become pitchers. How else can we afford pitchers?''</p>
        <p>As a long-range solution, the Bowden plan is commendable. But what can it do for the Reds in their attempt to get back in the National League Central race this season? Bowden's sons --  J. B., Tyler, Chad and their twin brothers (even younger, not quite 2) -- are not going to replace Steve Parris, Ron Villone and Rob Bell. So what is a general manager to do?</p>
        <p>''Every night,'' Bowden said, ''I go home and my kids say, 'Do you have a pitcher, do you have a pitcher?' I tell them, 'It's not as easy as your Nintendo game.' They do trades every day on their video games.''</p>
        <p>The inability of Ken Griffey Jr. to hit the Ken Griffey Jr. way the first two months of the season focused attention on the newcomer as the culprit in the Reds' disappointing start. A few days into June and he was hitting a paltry .211.</p>
        <p>Nonsense, Bowden said, Griffey was not the problem.</p>
        <p>''That's hogwash,'' he said. ''This guy is playing Gold Glove center field, he's on pace to hit 50, 60 home runs and drive in 120. It's not his fault that other guys haven't hit. If they were on base when he's hitting these bombs, he'd have 180 R.B.I.''</p>
        <p>Even when he was not hitting for average, Griffey was slugging home runs -- 15 in the first two months, 11 more since in 22 games, in which he has also batted .338 and raised his season average to .247.</p>
        <p>When the Reds acquired Griffey from Seattle last Feb. 10, the Reds were immediately viewed as the team most likely to win the division championship. But just about at the midway point in the schedule, the Reds languish eight and a half games behind St. Louis (before yesterday's games).</p>
        <p>''If you had told me in spring training that on June 30 we'd have the same number of wins as the Yankees, I'd probably have been happy,'' Bowden said.</p>
        <p>But he is not happy.</p>
        <p>''It's my responsibility that we're not winning,'' Bowden said. ''I haven't been able to make deals for starting pitching. Why do the Yankees have the same number of wins as we do? Starting pitching. You don't win without starting pitching.''</p>
        <p>The Reds have sent one of their starting pitchers, a rookie, Rob Bell (5.28 earned run average), back to the minor leagues after 15 starts. Parris has a 5.67 E.R.A. and 11 losses, Ron Villone a 5.92 E.R.A. Only Denny Neagle (3.86) and Osvaldo Fernandez (3.21) have been consistently effective.</p>
        <p>''We have guys who get us down, 5-0, before we say hello,'' the usually resourceful Bowden said. ''If we have starting pitching, we can get back in this thing. There are pitchers out there who I think will make a difference. We can't afford to add payroll so we couldn't get Mussina or Radke, that type of guy, but we need someone to keep us in games for six innings.''</p>
        <p>As if on cue, Pete Harnisch, the Reds' No. 1 starter, returned from nearly two months on the disabled list with an ailing shoulder and pitched six shutout innings against Arizona Friday night. The Reds won the game for Harnisch's first victory of the season.</p>
        <p>Griffey did not get a hit in four times at bat, lowering his average to .244. In 11 seasons with the Mariners, Griffey was a .300 hitter seven times. He hit a career-high .323 in the strike-shortened 1994 season, then followed it with a career-low .258. He hit .284 and .285 the past two seasons, leaving him at .299 for his career.</p>
        <p>His batting average, then, has never really been an accurate barometer of his overall contribution. He has averaged 52 home runs the past four seasons, and his 26 home runs this season have helped keep the Reds close enough to the Cardinals to be able to make a run at them if the starting pitching cooperates.</p>
        <p>''He's awesome,'' said Bowden, an admittedly shameless admirer, ''one of the best players I've seen in my life.''</p>
        <p>Sosa's Discomfort</p>
        <p>Can Sammy Sosa rediscover peace and happiness on the North Side of Chicago? The Cubs certainly hope so, but the betting in baseball circles (where no betting is allowed) is that he will not. The furious love affair that had existed has been shattered, very likely beyond repair. One friend of Sosa said he was ''dying'' to get away from the Cubs.</p>
        <p>But Sosa probably lost his chance to go elsewhere when the Cubs squandered what appeared to be their best chance to trade him. The Yankees came within one player of making a deal, but they wouldn't give the Cubs the extra player they demanded.</p>
        <p>Officials of other clubs saw the Cubs' stance as greedy. ''They let a left-handed A-ball pitcher stand in the way,'' one general manager said contemptuously, referring to Alex Graman. ''This might have been the biggest trade blunder in Cubs history. They had an opportunity to get four pretty good young players.''</p>
        <p>The Cubs may find another team that would be willing to give up a cache of good young prospects and sign Sosa to a contract extension worth perhaps $18 million a year, but it's highly unlikely. As one general manager pointed out, next winter's free-agent crop will feature Alex Rodriguez, Juan Gonzalez, Manny Ramirez and Chipper Jones. A team that otherwise may be interested in Sosa could sign one of those players and keep their prospects.</p>
        <p>Andy MacPhail, the Cubs' president, does not see the team's circumstances as dire as others obviously do.</p>
        <p>''Any time you get involved in these type of things,'' he said, ''you have to satisfy yourself that you did your best for the organization and the player. We made a good-faith effort to accommodate the player, balancing that with what we perceived our needs to be down the road. The Yankees chose to go a different road, which is their prerogative.''</p>
        <p>When it was obvious their talks with the Yankees had died, the Cubs quickly took steps to try to repair the schism that had developed with Sosa. General Manager Ed Lynch spoke with him in Pittsburgh, and MacPhail contacted one of his agents. There is not much confidence outside of Wrigley Field that their words will create the peaceful coexistence the Cubs now desperately need.</p>
        <p>Deep on the Disabled List</p>
        <p>The Cleveland Indians, who reached yesterday alive but a shocking nine and a half games from first place, have had a full-time job shuffling pitchers. Because they have had so many pitchers hurt this season, they have had to bring pitchers up from the minor leagues when they hadn't planned to or signed free-agent pitchers who were available only because other teams had released them.</p>
        <p>''You anticipate that you'll have to go to Triple A and get three guys during the season,'' Mark Shapiro, the team's assistant general manager, said. ''You can't do it with seven. We're seven pitchers deep on the disabled list. No team is equipped to handle that.''</p>
        <p>In order, the Indians have added to their pitching staff this season: Sean DePaula (now on the disabled list himself), Jim Brower, Mark Watson (lost on waiver claim), Scott Sanders (released next day), Paul Rigdon (disabled list, later optioned to minors), Tim Drew (optioned next day), Justin Speier, Jared Camp (lost on waiver claim), Jamie Brewington, Kane Davis (optioned, later recalled), Willie Martinez (optioned three days later), Brian Williams, Jaime Navarro (designated for assignment after two starts), Mike Mohler (designated for assignment two days later), Andrew Lorraine, Alan Newman (designated for assignment two days later).</p>
        <p>Charles Nagy, a veteran starter who has been on the disabled list since May 18, is expected back just after the All-Star Game break. Jaret Wright, on the disabled list for the second time this season, won't be back until August, if at all this year.</p>
        <p>Trading Benefits</p>
        <p>On the same day last week, Wednesday, Cal Eldred gained his 10th victory against 2 defeats for the Chicago White Sox and Jeff Cirillo hit 3 home runs in a game for the Colorado Rockies. Eldred and Cirillo were traded to their teams a month apart last winter by the Milwaukee Brewers.</p>
        <p>With Eldred becoming one of two 10-game winners, the White Sox have grabbed a commanding lead in the American League Central. With Cirillo hitting .348 and driving in 61 runs, the Rockies are challenging Arizona for first place in the National League West.</p>
        <p>Jose Valentin was in the trade with Eldred and is the White Sox shortstop. Within that same month, the Brewers traded Fernando Vina to St. Louis, where he was hitting .290 as the regular second baseman for the first-place Cardinals before going on the disabled list.</p>
        <p>The Brewers, at last look, were languishing near the bottom of the N.L. Central.</p>
