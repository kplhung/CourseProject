        <p>THE question is: How much would it cost to contain the global AIDS epidemic? The short answer is: Well, how much have you got?</p>
        <p>How much would it cost to banish ignorance, to deaden lust, to shame rape, to stop war, to enrich the poor, to empower women, to defend children, to make decent medical care as globally ubiquitous as Coca-Cola -- in short, to get rid of all the underlying causes of the epidemic in the third world?</p>
        <p>The latest global survey of the epidemic was released last week by Unaids, the United Nations agency dealing with AIDS. It estimated that more than one-third of all 15-year-olds in the worst-affected countries are still destined to die even if infection rates somehow drop.</p>
        <p>In the United States, AIDS is usually addressed as a medical problem with to be solved with health care or public health policy. Overseas experts say that even seeing the epidemic that way is a luxury that reflects American thinking: any germ can be killed if it is hammered long enough with a big enough wad of dollars. But AIDS in the third world, said Anthony Kinghorn, a South African consultant to governments and businesses facing the epidemic, is ''really a welfare and education issue rather than a medical one.''</p>
        <p>In Zimbabwe and India and Haiti,  one cannot tackle AIDS the way it has been fought in San Francisco and New York. One cannot simply put baskets of condoms in all the gay bars and clean needles in all the methadone clinics or even send speakers to all the high schools and plant scary articles in the press.</p>
        <p>For one, much of the world at risk of AIDS can't read. Most of the world at risk has never used a condom. Most of the world at risk has never heard of Act Up and wouldn't dare heckle a president. And most of the world with AIDS thinks it doesn't have the disease and doesn't know anyone who does, because 95 percent of those infected in the third world have never been tested. (Most estimates come from anonymous testing at pre-natal clinics.) And most of the world cannot afford the drugs that Americans can.</p>
        <p>With such verities in mind, then, how is one to think about containing AIDS -- say, in Africa, the continent most dramatically affected so far?</p>
        <p>If there was money, what might be done with it?</p>
        <p>Certainly, estimates are bandied about. The Unaids survey mentioned a need for $2 billion a year for sub-Saharan Africa, of which about $300 million has been committed, said Dr. Peter Piot, head of the agency.</p>
        <p>But that figure seems negligible, given the scope of the disease. And it is, because Unaids estimates are painfully conservative. The $2 billion was only for prevention -- not care -- and only to bring standards up to the level of Uganda or Senegal, the only two African countries that have cut their numbers of citizens living with AIDS. It envisioned modest goals: condom handouts, blood testing, counseling for prostitutes and students, routine treatment for venereal diseases, and so on.</p>
        <p>WHEN Unaids tries to calculate the theoretical additional cost of medical care, ''it gets more difficult,'' said Bernhard Schwartlander, the agency's chief epidemiologist. The calculations are pared down to what realistically might be done. They include treating only people with access to medical systems that can do easier things like tuberculosis treatment and pre-natal care reasonably well. Most of the money would go for the cheapest drugs, like the antibiotic Bactrim, which prevents only  simple infections. Some money is allotted for more sophisticated drugs to fight drug-resistant tuberculosis and fungal infections, and for an ''AIDS cocktail'' of anti-retroviral drugs -- but in these cases, only enough to reach a fraction of those infected because those therapies must be closely supervised and the medical resources to do so are scarce.</p>
        <p>In addition, the calculations assume that the cocktail will cost only $1,400 a year (as opposed to the $12,000 a year or more that an American AIDS patient might spend). To get the cost that low, Western drug companies would have to cut their prices by 90 percent or the drugs would have to be purchased from Brazil, India or other countries that ignore patents.</p>
        <p>If that could all be arranged by 2005, Mr. Schwartlander said, the cost would be about $1.7 billion a year to get the cheapest care for the dying to 40 percent of all infected Africans and the AIDS cocktail to 10 percent -- an inadequate, but realistic, goal. ''If the drugs are more expensive or you increase the coverage rate, the costs explode accordingly,'' Mr. Schwartlander said.</p>
        <p>Nobody calculates what it would cost to give Africans and Asians the kind of health care that Americans -- even American welfare recipients -- receive. That would run into hundreds of billions, because one would have to start from ground zero, building the hospitals and importing the doctors.</p>
        <p>To put this in perspective: There are an estimated 34 million HIV-infected people in the world, at least 30 million of them poor. Poor not just by American standards, but by world standards: living on less than $2 a day. AIDS specialists rarely say this bluntly, but the truth is that most of those 30 million people have simply been written off, because the first priority for the first few billion dollars is prevention, not treatment.</p>
        <p>Not that it is possible to talk so straightforwardly about the terrible cost of AIDS -- at least not until more political leaders in Africa realistically confront the dimensions of the problem, and more governments overseas mobilize to help Africa.</p>
        <p>Alan Whiteside, an economist who studies AIDS in South Africa, which has the world's fastest-growing epidemic, puts it this way: ''You can't give up on the infected because of the message it sends.'' But if he had $1 billion to spend most wisely, he would spend it on ''giving women more power, caring for orphans and getting them education.''</p>
        <p>Then there is the overwhelming problem of poverty. An HIV-positive American can focus on his T-cell counts; an HIV-positive African in a rural village still has to focus on finding clean water and food.</p>
        <p>''In Uganda,'' said Mr. Kinghorn, the South African consultant, ''there are lots of kids who are aware of AIDS now. But they're simply not able to protect themselves. They have to do high-risk things to put bread on the table.''</p>
        <p>Once poverty is factored in -- especially when the dying young can no longer build an economy -- the question becomes: How much can be done with the least money? But that, too, is problematic. The cheapest form of prevention is condoms. The United States Agency for International Development is the biggest condom customer in the world. With its European counterparts, the total bill for Africa and Asia runs to Tens of millions of dollars. But distribution is the difficult part, along with overcoming prejudices against them. When, for example, will  grown men in Soweto stop teasing young men by asking, ''Oh, do you shower with your raincoat on too?''</p>
        <p>A vaccine would also be a cheap countermeasure. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has put up $250 million for the hunt, and the Clinton administration has offered $1 billion in tax credits to any company that invents one. But a vaccine, like a cure, remains elusive. Optimists say one might be found and approved in 10 years.</p>
