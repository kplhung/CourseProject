        <p>AT one time, venturing into a hotel restaurant was asking to have your wallet lightened in exchange for indifferent if not terrible food. No more.</p>
        <p>In downtown Chicago, where a spate of fine midsize and small boutique hotels  has opened in recent years, the affiliated restaurants play down their hotel connections to attract a broader clientele that might otherwise be skeptical. Their kitchens are run by well-established chefs, and their midrange prices and high quality compare favorably to those of independent restaurants. Most have entrances from the street as well as from the hotel, and they attract many customers who might not realize they are in a hotel restaurant (although a long jaunt to a lobby restroom can clue them  in).</p>
        <p>These restaurants include the only sports-theme restaurant I can recommend, Mike Ditka's; it is one of the city's best steakhouses, which is saying a lot in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Mossant Bistro</p>
        <p>At Mossant in the Hotel Monaco, the  motif is hats. Mossant was a late-19th century Parisian hat maker, and the menu logo is a hand tipping a gent's hat. The  bistro sports a handsome lounge and bar area inside the street entrance. Down a few steps to the dining room, diners view a long open kitchen along one wall where Steven Chiapetti, the talented new chef, presides. White-clothed tables and booths are framed by dark polished woods, an elaborate plaster ceiling and Art Nouveau sconces. Paintings depict women of the period in fashionable hats, and antique men's and women's hats hang alongside one of the big framed  mirrors. (As it happens, the building, circa 1912, originally housed a millinery company.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Chiapetti worked at Grapes and at the once hip but now closed Mango before arriving here a few months ago. He quickly raised Mossant out of a torpor. His European-influenced American bistro cooking shows off clever presentations with easy-to-like flavors.</p>
        <p>Meals begin with an amusement such as little rolls of smoked salmon with black olive puree or tuna tartare in a mango-cilantro emulsion. A salad of seven kinds of lettuce with cucumber, carrot and red currant tomatoes tossed with sherry vinaigrette makes a cheery summer starter. A heartier appetizer is an omelet of wood-roasted mushrooms with bacon served with a petite salad. A huge shrimp comes wrapped in coils of crusty  shredded potatoes on a bed of salt cod and potato brandade with sweet pepper oil.</p>
        <p>Lobster ''confit,'' decadent but delicious, is a dramatic example of Mr. Chiapetti's style. A wide bowl with a scale pattern holds poached lobster meat molded into a dome-shaped shrimp and lobster mousse. It is laid over slivered artichoke hearts and a pool of lobster hollandaise garnished with corn sprouts and the head of the lobster shell, and is served with a side dish of peeled fingerling potatoes in garlic cream sauce.</p>
        <p>Snapper fillet is also a success, baked in a broth of oven-dried tomato and fennel then finished with fragrant saffron sauce and served in a beautiful plate with a bluefish pattern. Pork tenderloin, wrapped in thickly sliced applewood smoked bacon then roasted, tops a generous bed of sweated leeks and portobello mushrooms.</p>
        <p>After the rather rich entrees, a smooth trio of apricot, green apple and coconut sorbets makes a light satisfying finish, while strawberry crepes with vanilla orange sauce boasts loads of ripe seasonal berries but less-than-delicate crepes. The mellow red 1991 Chateau Pradeaux Bandol ($50) was perfect with the pork and fine with the rich seafood.</p>
        <p>Caliterra</p>
        <p>True to its name, this restaurant specializes in California-Italian cuisine. Secluded up a grand staircase and down the hall on the second floor of the Wyndham Hotel, the expansive room was designed by Bogdanow Partners of New York City (also designers of Union Square Cafe in New York and Rubicon in San Francisco). A cozy lounge with a magnificent hardwood bar is separated by a baby grand piano from the dining room, which has an earthy Italian color scheme; a gleaming central display kitchen is anchored by a brick oven. Two walls of glass windows afford a panoramic view to the southwest.</p>
        <p>John Coletta, the chef, is a skilled veteran of several luxury hotel restaurants, most recently the Shangri-La in Singapore. His dishes can be flashy in ways that sometimes remind me of Wolfgang Puck's Cal-Italian  style, but he has his own take on the popular West Coast hybrid cuisine.</p>
        <p>Meals begin with an assortment of freshly baked breads and a savory white bean dip, and quickly progress to a gratis treat -- most recently fava beans with Parmesan. An ideal sharable starter is one of the thin crusted  pizzas; our party of four loved the expertly baked version with lamb sausage, roasted peppers and caramelized onions. Standout  individual appetizers are Sonoma duck foie gras with rhubarb and a caramelized spring onion ''brulee,'' and a terrific simple salad of shaved artichokes and Parmesan with Lucini extra virgin olive oil.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Mr. Coletta's dishes feature seasonal produce from suppliers that ''practice ecologically sound agriculture.'' Roasted organic chicken breast wrapped with prosciutto and sage and served on soft mascarpone polenta with fig-balsamic essence, for example, comes with a garden's bounty of baby carrots, pattypan squashes, asparagus tips, shelled peas, green beans and teardrop tomatoes. Lean lamb loin is accented with robust ''barley-caponata'' risotto and an abundance of morel mushrooms, and a pair of sauteed soft shell crabs -- a special -- are cleverly placed on a bed of mellow caramelized cauliflower and tangy caperberries. Like the artichoke salad, angel hair pasta tossed with seasonal baby tomatoes and fresh basil is a simple delight.</p>
        <p>Not especially Californian or Italian, the creme brulee is nevertheless very good, served in a pastry tart and scattered with blackberries and blueberries. The moist warm chocolate cake with Frangelico ice cream is more true to the theme. Appropriately, the wine list holds California wines made with Italian grapes, like the lush 1997 Swanson Sangiovese from the Napa Valley ($44). Even our young waiter's sunny disposition and breezy manner reminded us of California.</p>
        <p>Mike Ditka's</p>
        <p>Named for the famed Bears football player and coach (and now ex-coach of the New Orleans Saints), this restaurant is the city's classiest sports theme restaurant as well as a  first-rate steakhouse. In the Tremont Hotel in the luxurious Gold Coast  neighborhood just off the Magnificent Mile, the handsomely masculine multilevel restaurant showcases a huge collection of tastefully displayed  sports memorabilia, a big bar where behemoth martinis are poured (our  sharp and friendly waitress kindly split one from the shaker tableside for my wife and me), plus a cigar lounge with live music Friday and  Saturday nights. Even the menu cover looks and feels like football casing.</p>
        <p>Appetizers by the chef, Tom Kenny,  include reliable renditions of steakhouse regulars such as jumbo shrimp cocktail and a salad of iceberg lettuce wedge and beefsteak tomatoes, but he moves on to more interesting fare. Crisp, slightly spicy pan-fried crab cakes come with rice flavored with  buttery shrimp broth and scallion mayonnaise, and the paper-thin tuna carpaccio, sparkling fresh, is served with wasabi sauce and marinated vegetables.</p>
        <p>The lobster ''cigar'' is a crunchy fusion spring roll filled with lobster,  andouille sausage and scallions served over charred tomato and black bean relish. It has been replaced since my visit by a duck version; I would have liked it more if it had been less oily from frying. Cobb salads with or without shrimp make a light summer meal, or can be split as a starter.</p>
        <p>The kitchen griller handles like an all-pro thick aged New York strip and ribeye steaks. The latter is served with a crown of French fries filled with mashed potatoes. But the signature dish at Mike Ditka's is -- in Chicagoese -- ''Da Pork Chop.'' It's a hefty cut of juicy grilled pork served with sauteed cinnamon-flavored apples and green-peppercorn and roasted garlic au jus, as well as spinach and spaetzle. Other well-executed red meat options are thickly sliced pot roast with bourbon-maple glaze served over mashed potatoes with seasonal vegetables and one of the city's best hamburgers.</p>
        <p>The burger is almost $10 but of excellent quality and almost too thick to bite into. From a properly red-heavy steakhouse wine list, a bottle of  1996 Villa Antinori Chianti Classico Riserva ($42) was a fine choice..</p>
        <p>When dining here, I always order a side of creamed corn cut fresh from the cob in season. For dessert, we tucked into but couldn't possibly finish a memorable banana cream pie and a nostalgic root beer float.</p>
        <p>312 Chicago</p>
        <p>Named after the downtown Loop area code, this spot in the Hotel Allegro serves Dean Zanella's stylish Italian-influenced American food. The inviting bilevel space is clubby, with tapestried armchairs and banquettes amid antiques and mahogany pillars. On our first visits to 312 Chicago two years ago, my family was charmed by the room and the accommodating  service more than the food, which too often veered into unbalanced excess.  Now Mr. Zanella has the kitchen and his creations much better in control,  and our meals lately have been delightful.</p>
        <p>As always, the evening begins with  daily baked focaccia and other breads served with a tasty black olive tapenade. Grilled pheasant sausage with wild mushrooms and caramelized fennel is a fine hearty starter, or for something more summery, there's a feisty salad of smoked trout with baby green beans, shaved fennel and pine nut dressing. And a big portion of fried calamari with caper aioli is crisp and greaseless, superior to so many versions around.</p>
        <p>Among four pastas is homey rigatoni with Anna's veal meatballs poached in tomato sauce with ricotta salata cheese. Named for Mr. Zanella's grandmother, the well-seasoned meatballs and big al dente pasta  tubes will please kids and grownups alike. I was more taken with the  shellfish stew chock full of clams, mussels, lobster and shrimp in saffron-scented broth. My wife enjoyed the baby lamb chops in artichoke sauce but not the dry and heavy goat cheese spinach pie that accompanied it. From a respectable list of American and Italian wines, we were led by our well-informed waitress to a refreshing 1997 Oregon King Estates pinot gris ($28).</p>
        <p>The pastry chef, Lynn Buzza, does herself proud with a vanilla bean pine nut cake with cherry compote and cardamom whipped cream. The caramelized panna cotta with strawberries and rhubarb in red wine syrup, however, suffered slightly from over-caramelization approaching bitterness. But for the most part, 312 delivers both Italian and American dishes with panache.</p>
        <p>Atwood Cafe</p>
        <p>This restaurant is adjacent to the new Burnham Hotel in the Reliance Building, with entrances from either the hotel lobby or from State Street. Designed by the architect and city planner Daniel Burnham and completed by the architect Charles Atwood in 1894, the Reliance Building -- a precursor of the modern skyscraper -- is listed as a National Historic Landmark. Near the burgeoning Loop theater district, it is usually packed early in the evening with pre-theater diners. The handsome high-ceiling room with gold and black-lacquered columns and sofa as well as banquette seatings offers a grand downtown view through huge bay windows framed by cherry red velvet drapes. During the day, light floods the room, bouncing off grand mirrors.</p>
        <p>The chef, Heather Terhune, a veteran of Palladin in Washington, D.C.  serves charming modern American dishes on an eclectic assortment of brightly colored plates -- some shaped like painter's palettes. She enjoys employing Nuevo Latino flavors, as in her intriguing appetizer quesadilla of roasted duck and manchego cheese with ancho chile salsa, and in smoky and spicy grilled shrimp with pineapple, cucumber and mango salsa. A lovely salad of mixed greens comes with a choice of dressings.</p>
        <p>For the main course, our party of four enjoyed an ample bowl of mussels in a tomatoey white wine broth with shallots and tarragon, as well as deftly grilled lamb loin in blackberry-bourbon sauce with asparagus and roasted Yukon gold potatoes. A pot pie that changes daily may be made with chicken and vegetables or with vegetarian chili. Unfortunately, while the pie on our last visit looked and sounded great, with its coarse textured corn bread crust and barbecued pork and vegetable filling, it was made with a terribly oversalted gravy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Terhune previously worked as the pastry chef at 312 Chicago, and her Atwood Cafe desserts are a high point of the meal. A chocolate-espresso fudge cake with java chip ice cream and a lemon shortcake with strawberries and whipped cream vanished from our table.</p>
        <p>A natural accompaniment for the lamb -- and even enjoyable to finish with the fudge cake -- was a soft, fruity 1997 Thackery Pleiades VI California red blend ($45). Service, while amiable, can miss a beat at peak hours.</p>
