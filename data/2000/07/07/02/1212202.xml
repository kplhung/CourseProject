        <p>ALTHOUGH construction has barely started at the Meadows at North Valley Stream here on Dutch Broadway in this southwestern Nassau County community, people are constantly stopping by to inquire when the 104 co-op apartments will be available.</p>
        <p>The answer is ''soon.''</p>
        <p>Sales of the 880-square-foot two-bedroom apartments, being built on about four and a half acres by Meadowood Properties of Islandia, will begin on Wednesday. The price for all apartments is $139,000, and they are scheduled for occupancy in October. At least one of the purchasers must be 62 or older, and household income cannot be more than $42,500.</p>
        <p>Among the half dozen or so visitors on a recent morning was James Madaio, a retired letter carrier who has lived in the area for 40 years with his wife, Catherine. His situation may be typical: he is 73, his wife is 72, and they no longer want their four-bedroom Cape Cod and its annual taxes of $5,000. But they also want to stay close to their children who live nearby, Mr. Madaio said.</p>
        <p>At the Meadows, residents will pay no more than $750 a year in property taxes  under a special zoning provision adopted in 1986 by the Town of Hempstead, which includes North Valley Stream, an unincorporated area. Under the zoning, developments for the elderly -- one family member must be at least 62 -- that are priced lower than market rates can qualify for property-tax abatements.</p>
        <p>The payments are called ''in lieu of taxes'' to differentiate them from regular real estate taxes. The payments in lieu of taxes are based on taxes paid on the property before new improvements are made, and they are frozen at that level for 25 years. The town may adjust the amount initially if the assessor thinks it is too low. There are also income qualifications for buyers.</p>
        <p>The authority for granting abatements comes from Article 5 of the Private Housing Finance Act, a 1942 state law. The law is supposed to encourage construction of rental and for-sale housing for moderate-income families, and Article 5 provides the authority for granting abatements. Municipalities can set their own guidelines, but the law requires that the incomes of qualifying renters or purchasers cannot exceed the median for the area as defined by the federal government. In Nassau and Suffolk, the median is currently $76,500.</p>
        <p>The Town of Oyster Bay and more recently the Village of Massapequa Park have also adopted what is often referred to as ''golden age'' zoning to encourage moderately priced housing for their elderly residents.</p>
        <p>Priority in all cases is given to residents of the school district in which the project is built, or to the parents of residents. Next in line are town or village residents or their parents, and the next priority is given to county residents and their parents.</p>
        <p>The purpose, said John Venditto, the Oyster Bay town supervisor, is to ''make it possible for our seniors to enjoy their later years with dignity as active and viable members of the communities they helped build.''</p>
        <p>The tax abatement must be given to a single entity, so projects are set up as co-op  corporations. Purchasers receive shares in the corporation and proprietary leases that entitle them to live in a certain apartment.</p>
        <p>AN incentive to builders is that density allowances are much higher for these developments than normal. In Hempstead, for example, the maximum allowance is 30 units to the acre instead of 20.  Marlene Kastleman, a spokeswoman for the Town of Hempstead, said that prices must be approved by the town, which takes into account variables like the size of the units, the amenities offered and the development's location.</p>
        <p>To perpetuate below-market prices, resales are also regulated and resale prices must be based on annual increases in the  Consumer Price Index from the time the apartment was bought plus any improvements that have been made. New purchasers also have to meet income limits.</p>
        <p>The stipulations for buyers at the Meadows at North Valley Stream are typical.  Priority will be given to residents of the North Valley Stream School District 13;  parents of school-district residents will be next in line. To qualify for an apartment, individuals can make no more than $37,100 a year, and for couples, the limit is $42,500. About 300 people have already put their names on a waiting list, said Douglas S. Partrick and James L. Neisloss, the partners in Meadowood Properties, the developer. Demand generally outstrips supply, so buyers are chosen on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
        <p>Because payments in lieu of taxes come to only $62.50 a month, the total monthly maintenance will be $198.46, which will include charges for water, the clubhouse and maintaining the grounds and buildings' exteriors. Owners will pay for their own gas heating and electricity, estimated at about  $105 a month. Mr. Neisloss said he expects that most buyers will sell a home in the area -- prices of $200,000 to $250,000 are typical --  and then pay cash for their apartments.</p>
        <p>In Hempstead, 1,283 units of tax-abated co-op housing in six projects have been completed under the ''golden age'' program, and five more projects, with 235 units including the 104 at the Meadows, are in various stages of development. The first project in Hempstead was Cedar Cove in Seaford. Its 71 one-bedroom apartments, completed in 1992, were priced at $89,500. The $139,000 two-bedrooms at the Meadows are the most expensive apartments so far.</p>
        <p>In the Town of Oyster Bay, which started its program in 1993, 1,020 units have been built or are under construction in six projects, and another 290 apartments in two projects are under review by town agencies prior to public hearings. In Oyster Bay, the price range has been $110,000 to $163,597.</p>
        <p>Although the Town of Huntington does not have a specific designation for tax-abated housing, one such co-op project, the Knolls at Melville, with 228 apartments, was built in 1998 by the Benjamin Development Corporation of Garden City. Steve J. Israel, a town councilman, recently proposed legislation that would require all developers to set aside 20 percent of their units for moderate-income families. A public hearing is scheduled for July 11.</p>
        <p>In the Town of North Hempstead officials are awaiting a committee report, due in about two months, on housing for moderate-income elderly residents, said Michael Levine, the town's planning commissioner.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey D. Forchelli, the managing partner in Forchelli, Curto, Schwartz, Mineo, Carlino &amp; Cohn, a Mineola law firm that represents developers of projects receiving tax abatements, said, ''There is a serious need for this type of housing, and public officials are responding to that need.'' One of the concerns people have about projects for the elderly is that ''seniors vote down school budgets,'' he said. But since taxes on ''golden age'' projects are frozen for 25 years, residents are much less likely to oppose school budgets, he said. In fact, they might be more likely to support school budgets that include money for adult-education classes they could enroll in.</p>
        <p>Applications for the co-op apartments must first be submitted to the municipality, and income eligibility is reviewed. The apartments are marketed and shown by private real estate brokers. For example, Prudential Long Island Realty in Syosset represents several of the developers. Its Senior Housing Consultants division has information available on all the co-op developments. Bart Cafarella and Fern Karhu, who run the division, discuss available co-op developments and other housing options for the elderly on their radio program, ''Seniors on the Move,'' at 7 p.m. every Monday night on WLUX-AM (540).</p>
        <p>In Woodbury, a developments currently under construction -- but already sold out -- is Woodbury Meadows, where 114 apartments are being built on Woodbury Road by  an affiliate of Jobco, a Great Neck developer. The two-bedroom, two-bath apartments with 1,175 square feet will be ready for occupancy in December. They were priced at $149,600. Monthly maintenance of $287  includes a $125.66 payment in lieu of taxes.  Income could not exceed $60,000 for an individual and $67,000 for a couple.</p>
        <p>Sales are expected to begin later this month at another development, Woodbury Gardens, on Jericho Turnpike, where 214 apartments are being constructed by E.O. Associates of Garden City. It will have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments with 1,100 square feet, priced at $163,597. Income limits are $60,000 for an individual and $67,000 for a couple. Monthly maintenance, including payments in lieu of taxes, has not yet been determined but will be under $300, said Robert Lippolis, the development company's director of operations. The project includes a 6,000-square-foot clubhouse with an indoor pool, and it will have an security gate with a video camera.</p>
        <p>In the Village of Massapequa Park, which adopted ''golden age'' zoning last September, sales are expected to start after Labor Day at its first project, Whitewood Landing. The 48 apartments are being developed by the Blue and Gold Development Corporation of Riverhead. Bob Havasy, the managing principal in Blue and Gold, and Steven Sameroff of North Hills recently completed a 100-unit co-op in Woodbury called Woodbury Cove, now sold out. The two-bedroom apartments there were priced at $139,500.</p>
        <p>At Whitewood Landing, the two-bedroom, two-bath apartments with 1,000 square feet,  are all priced at $165,000. Annual family income cannot exceed $70,000; monthly maintenance, including payments in lieu of taxes, is expected to be around $300.</p>
        <p>''Golden age'' housing sometimes faces  opposition because communities fear that it will change their single-family neighborhoods, Mr. Havasy said. ''Regardless of the fact that you are keeping grandma and grandpa in the community, people don't want these projects in their backyard,'' he said. ''But once they are there, people love them because they make great neighbors.''</p>
