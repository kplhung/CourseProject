        <p>It was a rough afternoon in Phoneix yesterday for the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
        <p>Ken Griffey Jr., who argued with his father in the dugout, and Pokey Reese left the game with minor injuries, reliever Manny Aybar was thrown out for hitting Tony Womack with a pitch and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Reds by 9-6, Cincinnati's first loss at Bank One Ballpark.</p>
        <p>Griffey could be seen yelling at his dad, Reds coach Ken Griffey Sr., when he was taken out of the game in the fifth inning with a twisted right knee. The younger Griffey was not available for comment.</p>
        <p>Jay Bell singled, doubled and tripled and Steve Finley hit his third home run in four games for the Diamondbacks.</p>
        <p>Alex Cabrera, in his fifth game since being called up from Class AA El Paso, was 3 for 3 with three R.B.I. for the Diamondbacks, but left the game after straining his left groin running out an R.B.I. double in the fourth inning.</p>
        <p>Going into the game, the Reds were 7-0 in Phoenix since the Diamondbacks came into the league in 1998, but Arizona jumped on starter Osvaldo Fernandez for five runs in the third inning, three of them on Finley's 23rd homer of the season.</p>
        <p>Griffey was hurt when he dodged out of the way of shortstop Barry Larkin as the two players converged on Luis Gonzalez's bloop single to short center field in the fourth. After being examined by the trainer and finishing the inning, Griffey was lifted for the pinch-hitter Alex Ochoa in the fifth.</p>
        <p>Reese was hit in the left wrist by a pitch from Armando Reynoso leading off the fifth. He left the game immediately, and the injury was diagnosed as a bruise.</p>
        <p>While Griffey and Reese left without talking to reporters, Reds Manager Jack McKeon said neither injury was serious.</p>
        <p>''Pokey's was not bad,'' McKeon said. ''I was planning to give him the day off tomorrow anyway. Junior's not bad, either. He didn't want to come out of the game, but we went ahead and took him out at the end of the inning.''</p>
        <p>GIANTS 4, DODGERS 1: Rich Aurilia went 3 for 4, including a two-run homer, and Kirk Rueter pitched six shutout innings for host San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Ramon Martinez also hit a two-run homer for the Giants, who snapped a three-game losing streak and beat their archrivals for the first time at Pacific Bell Park in five tries.</p>
        <p>Rueter (6-4) allowed seven hits with two walks and two strikeouts, and left after throwing 95 pitches. It was his fourth consecutive victory. Robb Nen struck out the side in the ninth for his 13th save in 17 opportunities.</p>
        <p>CARDINALS 10, ASTROS 9: Mark McGwire hit his major league-leading 30th home run for host St. Louis.</p>
        <p>McGwire hit the first pitch he saw from Octavio Dotel for a three-run shot in the first inning. He reached the 30-homer mark for the 11th time in his career.</p>
        <p>McGwire became the first player ever to have 30 homers at the All-Star break four times. Cincinnati's Ken Griffey Jr., who has 26 home runs this year, has done it three times.</p>
        <p>McGwire has homered in five straight games at Busch Stadium. Despite playing in only 66 of the team's 80 games, McGwire is on pace for 61 home runs. He has 552 career home runs.</p>
        <p>PHILLIES 4, PIRATES 3: Paul Byrd pitched seven strong innings for his first victory in almost two months for host Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Byrd (2-6), an All-Star last season, allowed five hits and three runs, struck out five and walked one in his first victory since May 3. It was Byrd's third straight strong start since being recalled from Class AAA Scranton on June 18.</p>
        <p>Byrd breezed through the first six innings as he retired 24 of 27 batters. His toughest inning was the seventh when he allowed the Pirates to get within 4-3.</p>
        <p>MARLINS 6, EXPOS 5: Ryan Dempster won a true Canada Day pitching matchup and Mark Kotsay had three hits, including a home run, as Florida Marlins beat host Montreal.</p>
        <p>Dempster (9-4), a native of Schelt, British Columbia, bested Mike Johnson (3-3) of Edmonton, Alberta, in a rare matchup of Canadian starters on the country's 133rd birthday.</p>
        <p>Just 8,529 fans were on hand at Olympic Stadium as the Expos fell to 4-7 on their 12-game homestand.</p>
        <p>BREWERS 4, CUBS 0: Jeff D'Amico came off the disabled list to dominate Chicago, allowing two hits over eight innings for host Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>D'Amico (3-4), who had been on the 15-day disabled list with tendinitis in his pitching arm, took a no-hitter into the sixth inning.</p>
        <p>He missed all but one inning of the last two seasons after two major arm surgeries, but the right-hander's successful comeback hit its highest point with an overpowering victory over Chicago.</p>
        <p>Eric Young broke up D'Amico's no-hit bid with a solid one-out single to right in the sixth. Young advanced to second on a flyout but was stranded when Sammy Sosa grounded out.</p>
