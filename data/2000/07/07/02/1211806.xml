        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a geriatrician I am greatly troubled by the Food and Drug Administration's proposal to make antibiotics, anti-hypertensive agents and other drugs available without a prescription (front page, June 28). People over the age of 65 are already likely to take multiple drugs with potential interactions and are most likely to suffer dangerous adverse reactions.</p>
        <p>There is a common belief that over-the-counter medicines are inherently safe. They are not. I have seen scores of patients who have suffered internal bleeding, confusion and kidney failure from medicines like Advil and Aleve, and life-threatening diarrhea from unnecessary antibiotic use.</p>

        <p>Many doctors do not know how to optimally prescribe medicines to older people. There is little reason to believe that most patients, even those with access to medical Web sites, will fare any better.</p>
