        <p>Sarah Ann Sulick, a daughter of Eileen Ryan Winnick of Westport, Conn., and George Sulick of East Haven, Conn., is to be married this afternoon to Stanley Myint, the son of Milica Myint of Belgrade and Aung Myint of Yangon, Myanmar. Wally Meyer, a justice of the peace, is to officiate in Westport.</p>
        <p>The bride, 30, and the bridegroom, 34, work in London, where she oversees acquisitions for Renaissance Films, a production company, and he is an associate and banking specialist at McKinsey &amp; Company, the management consulting concern.</p>
        <p>The bride graduated magna cum laude from the University of California at Los Angeles and received a master's degree in cinema and television from the British Film Institute and the University of London.</p>
        <p>Her father, who was the winemaker at Crosswoods Vineyards in North Stonington, Conn., until 1990, is a landscaper for LaFlamme Services in New Haven. Her mother works in New York as a preparation coach for people making television and other public appearances, including authors, physicians and executives. The bride is a stepdaughter of Carol Roper and of Stan Winnick. Mr. Winnick is the vice president of Bonn-Fiore Inc., a New York building contractor.
