        <p>As its reign atop the South Carolina Statehouse finally came to an end today, the Confederate battle flag had become almost as much a curiosity as an object of division, a symbol of the state's exhausted recent history even more than of its distant past.</p>
        <p>The arguments about the flag might have grown familiar over its 38-year presence, but they were often riveting, and no issue has delineated the state's racial chasm more clearly. There was plenty of partisanship among the crowd of about 3,000 who came to watch the flag's removal at noon today, and even a few unruly if nonviolent confrontations between the rowdiest elements at each end of the historical spectrum. But many in the crowd seemed both relieved and wistful, as if they would miss the emotional charge the debate had injected into public life.</p>
        <p>''I can't remember when it wasn't up there,'' said Dwight Enroe, a 32-year-old diesel mechanic who drove his family of four down from Spartanburg for a last glimpse, even though he favors its removal. ''For a while it seemed like that was all anybody talked about, that and video poker. What are we going to fight about now?''</p>
        <p>By a strange and resonant coincidence, the other issue that has obsessed the state for the last decade -- the insistent spread of video gambling machines -- also came to an end this weekend. Thanks to a State Supreme Court decision last October, the 34,000 machines that had noisily overtaken most of the state's gas stations and convenience stores were illegal as of midnight Friday, the largest shutdown of a state's gambling industry in nearly a century.</p>
        <p>The two issues were related principally by the intensity of the passions they created, and by their ability to eclipse virtually any other substantive discussion during legislative sessions and statewide elections. Amid the red tide of battle flags and the countervailing signs of ''shame'' at the Capitol today, many South Carolinians saw the holiday concurrence as a signal of renewal.</p>
        <p>''This is a momentous weekend,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. of Charleston, who has campaigned prominently against both video poker and the flag. ''After all these years of paralysis, the people of South Carolina finally rose up at the grass roots and got their representatives to respect their wishes. This state really can control its own destiny, and now we can get to education and everything else we put aside.''</p>
        <p>The vote to remove the Confederate flag from the dome and the Senate and House chambers came in May, after legislators finally tired of years of pressure from business and religious leaders, as well as a statewide tourism boycott imposed by the N.A.A.C.P. The moral argument against the flag as banner of slavery was ultimately unpersuasive; many suburban legislators who had previously supported the flag as a benign symbol of Southern heritage said the weariness of their constituents and the damage to the state's economy finally changed their minds.</p>
        <p>But the decision came only after flag supporters insisted on a compromise, which was played out today a few seconds after the flag's removal: A smaller, square version of the flag, once carried by the Army of Northern Virginia, was raised by Confederate re-enactors on a pole at the main entrance to the Capitol, adjacent to a monument to rebel soldiers. The new flag was almost too small to catch a breeze this afternoon, but its continued presence on the Capitol grounds has infuriated many prominent blacks.</p>
        <p>''It's clear that the movement to another flagpole was intended not to resolve the issue, but to continue the reign of the flag,'' said Dwight James, executive director of the state N.A.A.C.P. Conference, which conducted a silent protest march of about 800 people to the Capitol this morning. ''They're trying to distract those who have called for economic sanctions against the state, but it won't work.'' The boycott has already shown some signs of weakening, but the organization plans to maintain it as long as the flag flies in its new location.</p>
        <p>The end of video poker was likewise the result of a middle-class revolt against the enormous size of power of the gambling industry, which at its peak in 1999 was generating $3 billion in yearly revenue, mostly from players further down the economic ladder. A referendum against the machines was on the verge of passage last year when the state's high court beat the voters to it.</p>
        <p>''It was the same group that ultimately came together against the flag, too,'' said Richard Gergel, a prominent Columbia lawyer who brought a racketeering lawsuit against the video industry. ''They saw the social cost to the people who were gambling, and the economic cost to the state. And they finally made the political system respond.''</p>
        <p>But the gambling shutdown also had its costs. As the machines were unplugged, an estimated 3,000 people lost their jobs, many of them senior citizens who had been the required attendants in the game rooms.</p>
        <p>''Everyone's here to say goodbye,'' said David Whigham, the general manager of Treasures, a chandelier-bedecked ''casino'' that was packed with last-minute players all day Friday. ''The politicians and the churches thought they were ending some kind of vice, but really they were just breaking up a family.''</p>
