        <p>IN less than two months, Paul Romer has to decorate 66 rooms for film sets in 11 countries on three continents.</p>
        <p>''Good thing Ikea is all over the world,'' said Mr. Romer, producer of ''Big Brother,'' CBS's latest foray into voyeuristic television, which has its debut on Wednesday. On the show, five men and five women, all strangers, live together for 89 days in a 1,800-square-foot house built around TV lights and cameras. They must perform specific tasks in return for increased food allowances; one person is eliminated from the competition each week, based on viewers' votes. The last one home wins $500,000.</p>
        <p>After the program captured 60 percent of the viewing audience in Spain and the Netherlands, networks from Poland to South Africa bought customized versions, sending its Dutch creators at Endemol Entertainment into their 11-nation hyper-drive production schedule.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romer joined Endemol in 1995 and became known for shows of the ''Candid Camera'' variety. He called his original concept ''The Golden Cage'' and planned to isolate contestants in luxurious accommodations for a year, only to hurl emotional trials at them. But psychologists said the trauma might cause permanent damage. ''It wouldn't make for good television,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Romer decided to shorten the contest and to pack volunteers in a stripped-down, two-bedroom house -- no phones, TV's, radios or computers. Then he consulted with people who know how humans behave when cloistered far from the rest of the world: a submarine captain, the leader of a North Pole expedition and a Dutchman who took a team up Mount Everest. Their advice helped shape the atmosphere of the house. A psychologist told him that the color red encourages confession, so each set has a red room where contestants talk to the camera.</p>
        <p>Finally came the furniture, which was easy on the production budget, at around $20,000 a house. ''We were going back to basics,'' Mr. Romer said, ''so we went to the most basic store.''</p>
