        <p>Office space availability is down in Westchester County but, surprisingly, so are rent costs. A tight real estate market has seen a dip in available space from 15.5 percent to 14.5 percent and a drop in rents from $22.23 a square foot to $22.05, according to the latest quarterly market report from Newmark &amp; Company Real Estate, a regional commercial real estate concern.</p>
        <p>''I think that variance can be explained,'' Gil Ohls, a managing director at Newmark, said. ''In suburban markets you have differences almost from neighborhood to neighborhood and block to block because of the varying degrees of quality and importance of location.''</p>

        <p>The report said 369,684 square feet of office space was rented by high-tech Internet and telecom companies flocking to the area, particularly to White Plains. Only northern Westchester experienced some rising rents. Stay tuned: the report said ''more activity is expected in coming months.''</p>
