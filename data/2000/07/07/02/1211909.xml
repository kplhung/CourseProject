        <p>A pastel shell that Thelma Dear of Morristown found on a  Florida beach one day reminded her of soft angels' wings. It inspired an entire collection of shells and shell fragments that Mrs. Dear has assembled into small, whimsical animals, people and abstract objects of art, which is on display at the Newark Museum through July 30.</p>
        <p>Unlike many shell collectors, Mrs. Dear has as much use for pieces of shell or water-worn shells as she does for perfect specimens. Her work is marked by fanciful titles such as ''Poor Old Lady. I Have to Sell my Beloved Pet's Home,'' and ''I'm Glad I Have This Muff. It's Cold Up Here!''</p>
