        <p>TALES FROM THE DODGER DUGOUT</p>
        <p>By Carl Erskine.</p>
        <p>Sports Publishing, $19.55.</p>
        <p>From 1948 to 1959, Carl Erskine was a solid right-handed pitcher for the Dodgers. During his career, he had a record of 122-78, threw two no-hitters and led the National League in winning percentage in 1953. Along with his abilities on the mound, he proves himself to be a talented storyteller in his charming ''Tales From the Dodger Dugout.'' Erskine gives equal time to teammates, coaches, friends and opponents in what amounts to a series of short, snappy baseball anecdotes. While Erskine's stories span his entire life, the best are the ones that evoke his playing days in Brooklyn. Not only does he reminisce about great Dodgers like Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella, he also includes stories about Ebbets Field fixtures like the organist Gladys Gooding -- she always played ''Back Home Again in Indiana'' as Erskine, a native of Anderson, Ind., warmed up -- and the raucous Dodger fan extraordinaire Hilda Chester.</p>
        <p>John D. Thomas</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 9, 2000, Sunday  A brief review in the Book Review last Sunday, about ''Tales From the Dodger Dugout,'' by Carl Erskine, misspelled the name of the Brooklyn Dodgers' organist at Ebbets Field. (It was also misspelled in the book.) She was Gladys Goodding, not Gooding.</p>
