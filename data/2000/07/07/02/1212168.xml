        <p>HERE'S a little real life morality play about suburban life and manners in sedate northern Westchester.</p>
        <p>You pull into a gas station with your 9-year-old daughter in the back seat. At the pump across from you is a black Toyota playing the tape deck so loud it could make a car shake in Putnam County. It's typical boom box fare, thunderous, throbbing rap -- not your kind of music, but it's a free country, more or less, and it takes all kinds.</p>
        <p>But as you get out of the car to fill your tank, you realize that almost every word you can decipher is one that can't be used in this newspaper. (Indeed, it strikes you in passing as sort of an intriguing linguistic riddle -- how can the artiste, whoever he may be, spew out so many verboten words in such profusion and still end up with something approximating a real sentence?)</p>
        <p>You are not, you like to think, a totally clueless, hopeless, addled, over-the-hill, geezer fossil, but this does seem like thoroughly offensive and even provocative behavior. You wouldn't allow that music anywhere near your kids anyplace you had control of. You wouldn't consider imposing it on someone else. Should you sit quietly and live with it on a sunny Sunday at the gas station in Millwood or should you politely tell the other driver you wish he'd keep his music to himself?</p>
        <p>Let's add a complication: the driver is black -- a large black man with his shirt mostly unbuttoned in the midafternoon heat and a badge identifying him as a prison guard. You are white, and the casual encounter is taking place in a part of Westchester that will never win any awards as the diversity capital of America.</p>
        <p>You could argue that the problem with your suburban life is that there's not enough of this -- that it's a big, messy, diverse, often foul world out there and there are worse things than having your kid encounter a minor, harmless sliver of it amid the comfortable monochrome of suburbia. If the guy was implicitly or explicitly (well, let's make that explicitly) sending a signal you didn't want to hear, maybe he was onto something. You could argue that you'll be there for five minutes at the most, so it's no big deal. It's not likely a polite request will produce an instant cessation of the annoyance anyway. And what could be messier than an ugly clash at the gas pump? What good could come out of it?</p>
        <p>Not one for confrontation, you fill up and drive on. Still, you wonder. What if the driver were white, some snotty rich kid in his dad's Land Rover? Would it be appropriate then to tell him he's welcome to his own choice of profanity but he doesn't have to share it with you? If appropriate then, why not with the Toyota? What if it were a working-class white kid, spewing forth either profane or racist garbage? What if you were black but just as offended by the X-rated rap? Would it be appropriate to speak up?</p>
        <p>It's pretty safe to assume that in most cases, certainly in the ones focused on race, a sense of suburban politesse trumps everything else. Most people would keep their qualms to themselves and figure their daughter won't be irreparably harmed -- if she's even tuning in -- by a few minutes of syncopated filth. Some people, you assume, would take a welcome-to-the-real world view of the whole thing or provide standard liberal nostrums about the real obscenity being the violence all across the media, not a stream of offensive words thundering out of some prison guard's car.</p>
        <p>You don't really think -- or would not even want to think -- that living in a green corner of Westchester gives you and your kids a free pass from the messiness hovering just down the road, up the alley, back in the city. Still, the moment with its wisp of race and anger stays with you like an intrusive thought that hovers in your brain.</p>
        <p>Race, as this newspaper has been reminding us of late, remains the great divide. But it can seem an invisible one in many corners of the suburbs. It's there, of course, percolating just beneath the surface as close, it turns out, as the car at the next gas pump and the millions of questions that a brief encounter can produce.</p>
        <p>So, dear reader, over to you. Is there a real dilemma here or just white-bread squeamishness? What would you do? Why would you do or not do it? You can reach me at Countylines@nytimes.com.</p>
