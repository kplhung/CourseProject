        <p>Clint Black is a pretty straightforward guy, but he does offer up one surprise. He's from Long Branch. That's New Jersey, not Texas. But it was his eventual move to the Lone Star state that propelled him into country music fame. In 1989, he led the new-country vanguard which included Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson and Trisha Yearwood and stood out with his fluid R&amp;B-laced vocals and well-crafted accessible songs like ''Killin' Time.'' He performs at the PNC Arts Center in Holmdel Thursday, part of a tour supporting his latest album, the all-acoustic ''D'Lectrified,'' which includes a song from ''Monty Python's Meaning of Life,'' which has to be a country music first. As if that's not enough, his repertory covers country, rock, R&amp;B and Dixieland. Not bad for a Jersey boy.</p>
