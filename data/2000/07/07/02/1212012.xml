        <p>Ed Bernstein had a point to make.</p>
        <p>The price of prescription drugs had become an issue in the United States Senate race in Nevada, as in many Congressional races elsewhere. Mr. Bernstein, the probable Democratic nominee, wanted to drive home his assertion that former Representative John Ensign, the Republican nominee and the leader in the polls, was beholden to drug companies because over the years he had accepted almost $100,000 in campaign cash from them.</p>
        <p>So last Thursday in Las Vegas, when 20 elderly people came to hear Mr. Bernstein commiserate about the price of pills and shots, he opened up the dialogue by dumping $100,000 on the table. In cold, hard cash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ensign's acceptance of $100,000 in drug company money, Mr. Bernstein declared, ''stands against working families, against seniors, against Americans getting affordable prescription drugs.''</p>
        <p>''I will not stand on the side of the drug companies,'' he added. ''I'll stand on the side of you.''</p>
        <p>Did Mr. Bernstein, who readily acknowledged that he had withdrawn the money from his bank only a few hours earlier and would forthwith return it, make his point?</p>
        <p>''I hope he's for real,'' said Trish Barrios, who was in the audience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ensign accused Mr. Bernstein of using ''a bad political stunt'' to launch ''an ugly personal attack.''</p>
        <p>Did Mr. Bernstein, a trial lawyer, ever accept any campaign money from special interests, like trial lawyers?</p>
        <p>There is ''good'' special interest money and ''bad'' special interest money, he replied, arguing that lawyers seek only to help, whereas drug companies seek only to gouge.</p>
