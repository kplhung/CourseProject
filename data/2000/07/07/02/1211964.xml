        <p>CRA-A-A-CK!</p>
        <p>No noise in the major leagues compares to the impact of Mike Piazza's bat with a thrown baseball. Not McGwire. Not Sosa. Not Griffey.</p>
        <p>The collision carries to the far corners of a crowded ballpark, and also crashes through the speakers of a television set or a radio.</p>
        <p>That impact makes you pick up your head to see where the ball is heading, the way Piazza's savagely clubbed three-run homer thudded against the left-field facade Friday night. The wallop stunned the Braves at the end of an improbable and by now historic 10-run rally in the eighth inning that allowed the Mets to shock the Braves, 11-8, at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>The two teams went at it again yesterday afternoon -- and Piazza had another home run in the Mets' 9-1 victory -- after barely enough time for the concussion to die down, along with the cheers and the holiday fireworks.</p>
        <p>Now that resonance is part of the deepening relationship between two ball clubs, the Mets and the Braves, perhaps just in time for the geniuses of baseball to realign it out of significance.</p>
        <p>Thrown together in the National League's East Division, the Mets and the Braves have created their own little duel, still lopsided in favor of Atlanta, but at least starting to take on some depth and equality.</p>
        <p>Rivalries make the games mean something, give them a context. Otherwise, they are just contests between fine athletes. When the Giants take on the Washington Redskins on a grim autumnal afternoon, fans reminisce about how Lawrence Taylor urgently waved for the medics after breaking Joe Theismann's leg at midfield. There is a history.</p>
        <p>When the faded Boston Celtics meet the resurgent Los Angeles Lakers, there are memories of ancient series in late spring, Russell and West, McHale and Abdul-Jabbar. There is a history.</p>
        <p>When Italy plays France in the finals of the European soccer championships today, there will be memories of the 31 times these nations have played, starting in 1910. France has won the last two World Cup encounters, 2-0, in Mexico City in 1986 and then the quarterfinals in St. Denis in 1996, on the dreaded penalty kicks. My wife and I watched in a French cafe in Aix-en-Provence, and she kicked me under the table to stop me from twitching every time Roberto Baggio made a move. There is a history.</p>
        <p>Now the Mets and the Braves are just getting interesting, but in fact the two teams go back a ways.</p>
        <p>The Braves have their roots in a damp and seedy little nook called Braves Field in the Back Bay section of Boston, when they used to play the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants 11 times each, home and away.</p>
        <p>After the Braves moved to Milwaukee in 1953 the Mets were founded from the dregs of other rosters in 1962 and Spahn and Aaron visited the rusted, rickety Polo Grounds. They were swept in a doubleheader by the dismal Mets, after which Bobby Bragan, the manager of the Braves, said he was glad to escape this ''chamber of horrors'' -- surely a description Bobby Cox might have revived for Shea on Friday night. The Braves and Mets have had their differences. On May 4, 1964, in County Stadium (you could look it up, but I was there), the clubs staged an old-fashioned dust-up at home plate, after Ed Bailey of the Braves resented a characteristic hard slide by Ron Hunt.</p>
        <p>In the confusion, the Mets' 73-year-old manager wound up underneath 23-year-old Denis Menke of the Braves, who had this horrible thought: ''Oh, my God, I've killed Casey Stengel.''</p>
        <p>Hah. Fat chance. Writers went out drinking with Casey long after midnight. The old boy looked a little creaky but totally denied ever being on the field during the fray. He was still going strong at last call, as I vaguely remember. There is a history.</p>
        <p>The Mets beat the Braves in the 1969 National League Championship Series. The Mets beat the Braves regularly when they were good in the 80's. The Braves beat the Mets pretty regularly since they got good in the 90's. There is a history.</p>
        <p>Fans can surely remember how the Braves killed the Mets' wild-card hopes on the final lost weekend of 1998. They certainly can recall how the Braves put the Mets into a tailspin last September, but then how the Mets roared back from a three-game deficit to throw the fear of Melvin Mora into the Braves before finally succumbing in the 11th inning of the sixth game.</p>
        <p>Counting the playoffs last year, the Mets had won only 9 of 32 games from the Braves in the past two seasons, going into yesterday. ''It's a good rivalry,'' said Stan Kasten, the president of the Braves, being gallant. ''The Mets are one of the two or three best teams in this league.''</p>
        <p>There are even latter-day Hunt-Bailey traces in Piazza's being upended by Brian Jordan in the playoffs last year, but nobody duked anybody this time around.</p>
        <p>Then there is the matter of John Rocker, who took it personally when verbal assassins shouted ugly things at him from the stands. Rocker's diatribe against New York (actually against the diversity of America itself) was the reason for the heightened police presence at Shea this weekend.</p>
        <p>Now the Braves will take a while to shake the memory of all those bases on balls, the sizzle of the fuse cord leading to the terminal explosion of Piazza's brute home run. The history grows.</p>
