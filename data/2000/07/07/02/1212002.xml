        <p>Even a course-record 61 by Kirk Triplett could not steal the spotlight from Mark Calcavecchia today at the Greater Hartford Open.</p>
        <p>Calcavecchia's second straight six-under-par 64 put him at 17-under 193 through 54 holes, three strokes ahead of Notah Begay III, who shot a 67 at the Tournament Players Club at River Highlands. Calcavecchia, 40, had shared the second-round lead with Begay, who is seeking to become the first player to win back-to-back tournaments this year. Begay, a teammate of Tiger Woods on the 1994 Stanford team that won the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship, won his third title in 10 months last Sunday when he captured the St. Jude Classic in Memphis.</p>
        <p>Triplett -- who broke the course record of 62 that had been shared by five players -- and Edward Fryatt (66) were tied for third place, four strokes off the pace, after a round that was played in sunny, windless weather on a course whose soft greens and firm fairways continued to yield low scores.</p>
        <p>Several missed putts at the start hurt Begay, who has become a spectator favorite during his second year on the P.G.A. Tour. ''You can't miss 2-foot putts like I did,'' Begay said. ''I made some stupid mistakes at the start, but I kept patient and I'm happy where I'm at.''</p>
        <p>Calcavecchia likes to take breaks during the PGA Tour season. Indeed, this is his first tournament in a month. ''I like to get away,'' said Calcavecchia, who is 40th on the money list with earnings of $595,023. ''I didn't touch a club during the month that I took off. I swam, took the kids to water parks and I bowled a lot. Matter of fact, I had a 706 series with one game of 267.''</p>
        <p>Paired with Begay today, Calcavecchia had a fast start. He birdied the first two holes and went ahead by three strokes when Begay missed a 2-foot putt on the second hole.</p>
        <p>Begay drew within a stroke of Calcavecchia with birdies on the next two holes, but that's as close as he would get as Calcavecchia opened a four-stroke lead at the turn. Having taken only 30 strokes on the front nine, Calcavecchia stood at 16 under.</p>
        <p>Calcavecchia, who had seven birdies and one bogey during his round, went to 17 under on No. 11 and to 18 under on the 13th to lead by five strokes. But Begay pulled within three strokes when Calcavecchia had his only bogey of the round, on No. 17, before parring the final hole.</p>
        <p>Triplett did not have any bogeys in his round, which included nine birdies.</p>
        <p>He had a 31 at the turn, then bettered that with a 30 on the back nine that included consecutive birdies on Nos. 15, 16 and 17.</p>
        <p>''I keep waiting for the greens to get hard, but they're still soft,'' said Triplett, who had a 72 on Friday after an opening-round 64. ''I think the course is playing a little bit short because the fairways are firm and the greens are receptive. That's why we're still getting low scores.''</p>
        <p>A 61 was not a new experience for Triplett, who ranks 11th on the money winning list with earnings of $1,321,209.</p>
        <p>''I've shot 61 twice before for course records on par-72 courses,'' said Triplett, who tied for second place here in 1995 behind Greg Norman.</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>CHARLES HOWELL, the National Collegiate Athletic Association champion who is playing in his first tournament as a professional, carded a 68 to stand at four-under-par 206 . . . This event attracted 9 of the top 25 money winners, all of whom but DAVIS LOVE III and TOM SCHERRER survived the 36-hole cut. Demonstrating how score-friendly the Tournament Players Club at River Highlands is, 86 of the 156 players in the field broke par in the opening round on Thursday and 51 did on Friday. Of the 83 players surviving the 36-hole cut, 47 bettered par 70. . . . Even without such marquee names as TIGER WOODS, DAVID DUVAL and PHIL MICKELSON, the Greater Hartford Open continues to draw among the largest galleries on the Tour. Today's crowd was estimated at 65,000.</p>
