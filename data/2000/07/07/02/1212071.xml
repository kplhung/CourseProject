        <p>MacArthur's War</p>
        <p>Korea and the Undoing of an American Hero.</p>
        <p>By Stanley Weintraub.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 385 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>The Free Press. $27.50.</p>
        <p>WAR is hell, goes the adage. The Korean War was no exception. It was also one hell of a mess. The mess began with the map. The line of 38 degrees latitude is nothing more than a surveyor's stripe that happens to bisect the Korean peninsula -- a cartographic accident with fateful implications. At the end of World War II Soviet troops accepted the Japanese surrender north of the 38th parallel, and American troops did the same to the south of it. Moscow as well as Washington proclaimed the goal of a united Korea, but both powers swiftly proceeded to set up rival governments, then seemed to lose interest in Korea altogether. By 1949, both had withdrawn their occupation forces, leaving two insecure, itchy regimes -- Kim Il Sung's at Pyongyang in the north and Syngman Rhee's at Seoul in the south -- eyeing each other belligerently across the arbitrary boundary that separated them.</p>
        <p>On June 25, 1950, North Korean armored columns clanked across the parallel, seeking to unite the peninsula under Communist rule. Stanley Weintraub, a professor at Pennsylvania State University and a mightily disillusioned Korean War veteran, calls the three-year conflict that ensued ''MacArthur's War.'' It might just as accurately be called Truman's War. Indeed, the struggle between President Harry S. Truman and Gen. Douglas MacArthur for control over the Korean conflict forms the central drama of Weintraub's spirited history.</p>
        <p>In 1950, MacArthur was 70. A hero of two world wars, supervisor of the reconstruction of postwar Japan and commander of the American forces in the Far East, he was ''senior to everyone but God'' in the American military. But time and historians have dimmed his reputation. Weintraub paints MacArthur as arrogant, egomaniacal and almost criminally headstrong: part satrap, part Caesar and entirely a law unto himself. If there were a prize for the Writer Who Most Loathes MacArthur, Weintraub would be a serious contender.</p>
        <p>He would, of course, face stiff competition. Truman, who distrusted the general from the war's outset, called MacArthur Mr. Prima Donna. Truman and MacArthur alike saw the North Korean attack as a Soviet-sponsored test of the West's resolve. But Truman also viewed the Korean assault as a feint, a ploy to distract the United States in Asia while the Russians readied their main punch in Europe. The president therefore decided that Korea would be a limited war, confined to specific ends and restricted in means. So while instructing MacArthur to defend South Korea, the president had the general's orders written so as not to give him too much discretion.</p>
        <p>Sheer desperation at first left small room for discretion. MacArthur flung into Korea a few scratch units gone slack from easy duty in occupied Japan. The wretchedly equipped Americans could do little more than join the pell-mell South Korean retreat down to Pusan, at the peninsula's southern tip.When the fighting stabilized in September, desperation gave way to daring. Daring, in turn, bred delusion and eventually disaster.</p>
        <p>MacArthur now championed a hair-raisingly bold scheme to launch an amphibious landing at Inchon behind the enemy's lines. Given Inchon's tricky 30-foot tides, the general himself estimated that success was a 5,000 to 1 shot. But on Sept. 15, 1950, he pulled it off, vastly enhancing his already formidable mystique. Victory at Inchon bewitched almost everyone in the American chain of command, up to and including the president. Once-cautious men who had declared the restoration of the 38th parallel boundary as their only war aim now recklessly sought to bring all of Korea under Syngman Rhee's rule. Truman and the Joint Chiefs of Staff authorized MacArthur to cross the 38th parallel -- but only after swallowing the sorcerer of Inchon's claim that China would never intervene on North Korea's behalf. The only conditions they imposed were that he undertake no air or naval action against China and that he permit only South Korean troops into the zone of the Korean-Chinese frontier along the Yalu River.</p>
        <p>To ensure that MacArthur understood those limitations, Truman flew 7,000 miles to parley with his imperious general at Wake Island. If China tried to put ground troops across the Yalu River, MacArthur assured his commander in chief at their October 1950 meeting, there would be ''the greatest slaughter.'' The war, he predicted, would be over by Thanksgiving. But meanwhile, Weintraub says, MacArthur fell to his knees nightly to pray for Chinese intervention, so that he might have the climactic Asian military showdown that he not-so-secretly wanted.</p>
        <p>Two days before Thanksgiving, American soldiers, dispatched by MacArthur far northward in direct violation of Truman's orders, were urinating triumphantly into the Yalu. Hours later, some 260,000 Chinese troops appeared as if from nowhere and hurled MacArthur's troops southward in a grisly repetition of the flight toward Pusan. By Christmas, the battered and humiliated Americans were struggling in subzero cold to re-establish a defensive line near the 38th parallel.</p>
        <p>This second rout infuriated MacArthur. He requested 34 atomic bombs. He contemplated sowing a belt of radioactive cobalt to interdict further Chinese advances. He demanded authority to blockade and bomb China and to unleash Chiang Kai-shek's troops from Formosa (now Taiwan) against the Chinese mainland. In short, he threatened to turn the Korean War into a full-blown war against China -- the outcome that civilian authorities were most determined to avoid. When Washington demurred, MacArthur publicly accused the administration of appeasement. All this was too much for Truman. On April 11, 1951, the president relieved MacArthur of his command. Truman was excoriated by the general's legions of worshipers, but most historians have praised him for asserting the principle of civilian authority over the military.</p>
        <p>Here ''MacArthur's War'' abruptly ends. Weintraub offers neither a comprehensive history of the Korean War, which continued for two years after MacArthur's dismissal, nor a thorough exploration of Truman's side of the controversy. But for depicting the agony of the war on the ground, and for cutting MacArthur down to size -- or off at the knees -- this impassioned book has few equals.</p>
