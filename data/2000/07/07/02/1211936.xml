        <p>SUMMER in the city is all hard edges. New Yorkers tan on tar, grill on brick, take grounders off macadam, porch-sit on iron fire escapes. Band music doesn't waft from a gazebo on a green, it ricochets off marble columns at Lincoln Center plaza.</p>
        <p>So city people have developed ways of softening the season. Rituals are observed that make summertime in the city bearable, if not idyllic.</p>
        <p>They may even make life temporarily sensual and pleasant, particularly if the ritual calls for consuming frosty liquids on a stoop. Throw in a stolen kiss or a down-the-line triple, and they verge on the sublime.</p>
        <p>Some New Yorkers take pride in their sexy cars, for example. At one spot in Staten Island where car owners congregate, so do the latest models, including ones called Susie and Michelle.</p>
        <p>In Flushing, Queens, Chinese dragon boats practice at Meadow Lake for the big race in August. When the finish is tight, these vessels look like a herd of waterborne beasts straining their snouts toward the line.</p>
        <p>Early census data show that Manhattan leads the city in the number of cinemaphiles renting cell-sized studios. So if you screen it outdoors, they will come. Show the movie at Bryant Park, the mecca of open-air theaters, and New Yorkers will scheme ingeniously to grab the choicest spot.</p>
        <p>In a corner of the Bronx, the beach is a concrete strand in a warehouse zone. On Sundays, it is where Latin bands use loose-limbed rhythms to move the crowd in waves.</p>
        <p>And in Brooklyn, as the mercury rises, so does the drive to find Haagen-Dazs at midnight. At the chain's original store, in Brooklyn Heights, the hot and hungry  lick their lips, dreaming of pralines and cream.</p>
