        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I remember the first time I saw Kobe Bryant play basketball. It was a breezy Friday night in the fall of 1994, and he led Lower Merion High School to a romp over Haverford High, another suburban Philadelphia school. At the time, I was a fledgling freelance reporter for The Main Line Times, and watching Kobe, I felt energized, my senses sharp. He reminded me of Michael Jordan -- the leaping ability, the agility, the swagger, the style -- and I knew I had just seen a prodigy.</p>
        <p>Six years later, after watching Kobe carry the Los Angeles Lakers to an overtime victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 4 of the N.B.A. finals, this time on television in my apartment, I was energized again.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I remember the first time I saw Kobe Bryant play basketball. It was a breezy Friday night in the fall of 1994, and he led Lower Merion High School to a romp over Haverford High, another suburban Philadelphia school. At the time, I was a fledgling freelance reporter for The Main Line Times, and watching Kobe, I felt energized, my senses sharp. He reminded me of Michael Jordan -- the leaping ability, the agility, the swagger, the style -- and I knew I had just seen a prodigy.</p>
        <p>Six years later, after watching Kobe carry the Los Angeles Lakers to an overtime victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 4 of the N.B.A. finals, this time on television in my apartment, I was energized again.</p>
        <p>I turned to my friend Ted, a Lower Merion native as well, and said: ''Do you believe this? He's just become a legend. And he grew up right around the corner from us on Remington Road. And he's just 21.''</p>
        <p>I recently had lunch with an old neighborhood friend's mother who, like me, lived in the town of Wynnewood, Pa. She had crossed paths with the young Kobe, too, because her youngest son had caught the basketball bug at Lower Merion High. Some Saturdays she would take her son to practice and pick up Kobe, who lived up the street, on the way.</p>
        <p>She told me how one day she joined the team at its annual fund-raising car wash. She remembers Kobe standing off to the side, holding a sign advertising the car wash. ''You've got to go out near the street and hold your sign up, Kobe,'' she told him. ''No one's going to see you if you stand back here.''</p>
        <p>Hard to believe that the shy 10th-grader's face popped up on a video screen in a Times Square store-front window as I walked home from work one night.</p>
        <p>For all of us who ever played basketball growing up in the neighborhood, Kobe represents a dream. He dreamed big and followed his dream. And that's what we should all do: follow our dreams.</p>
