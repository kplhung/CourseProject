        <p>TEN years ago, Stacy Weissman and her husband, Larry, moved into a house in the Westchester village of Rye Brook. This year, when the Weissmans and their two sons outgrew their quarters,  Mrs. Weissman didn't think twice. They bought a larger new home in the village.</p>
        <p>''We could have gone and bought another house anywhere, but we wanted to stay in Rye Brook,'' she said. ''It's a small, very close-knit community where everyone knows everyone else, and because of this, adults and children alike have the opportunity to form very special friendships here.  Sure, I can get more house and more land further north, but what we have here is more important to us.''</p>

        <p>TEN years ago, Stacy Weissman and her husband, Larry, moved into a house in the Westchester village of Rye Brook. This year, when the Weissmans and their two sons outgrew their quarters,  Mrs. Weissman didn't think twice. They bought a larger new home in the village.</p>
        <p>''We could have gone and bought another house anywhere, but we wanted to stay in Rye Brook,'' she said. ''It's a small, very close-knit community where everyone knows everyone else, and because of this, adults and children alike have the opportunity to form very special friendships here.  Sure, I can get more house and more land further north, but what we have here is more important to us.''</p>
        <p>Other couples before them have felt the same way. Walter and Bunny Niles, now in their 80's, have lived in Rye Brook for 42 years. ''We educated three children here,'' Mr. Niles said, ''and the school system was great. The cultural life is great. The people are great. Now we belong to a very active senior group and do a lot of things. What do you need beyond that?''</p>
        <p>Rye Brook's small-town charm, its schools and its proximity to major highways, to the Westchester County Airport and to shopping malls have resulted in a ''tight housing market,'' said Marcia Rogull, an associate broker at the Julia B. Fee real estate company in Rye.</p>
        <p>Once a bastion of moderate-sized homes nestled close together, Rye Brook has recently seen a substantial amount of new construction, much of it large, expensive houses. ''It used to be rare to find a home here over $800,000,'' Ms. Rogull said. ''We never really had that kind of pricing. But houses are appreciating and going for higher prices than they have in the past.''</p>
        <p>Rye Brook was an unincorporated area in the Town of Rye, in southeastern Westchester, until it officially became a village on July 7, 1982. Its growth doesn't surprise  Francis L. Filipowski, its mayor. ''At 18, we think of ourselves as a young adult trying to formulate for the first time a master plan to try and identify what the future holds for us,'' he said. ''It's exciting that everyone here can help define the community and plot where we can go from there.''</p>
        <p>One problem that the village has faced in the last decade is a decline in property tax assessments of about $8 million. The International Business Machines Corporation moved out about eight years ago, and the Rye Town Hilton and the 106-acre Doral Arrowwood Resort and Conference Center won tax appeals.</p>
        <p>Now, the village's tax base is beginning to increase because of the construction of new homes and offices. Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, has just opened a national training center at Doral Arrowwood.</p>
        <p>About 70 percent of the village is in the Blind Brook school district, and the remaining 30 in the Port Chester school district. Homes in the Port Chester district are frequently older Cape Cods, ranches and small colonials built on small lots. In the Blind Brook district, typical houses are larger split-levels and colonials on one-third acre. The median price of a house in the Port Chester district is $400,000, and $550,000 in Blind Brook.</p>
        <p>Many first-time buyers are attracted to the Rye Hills section of the village, Ms. Rogull said, a neighborhood in the Port Chester district with about 175 homes, typically three-bedrooms of about 1,600 square feet with one or two baths. Prices range from $250,000 to $400,000.</p>
        <p>SINGLE-FAMILY cluster housing of 2,000 to 2,800 square feet is available in the $400,000 to $675,000 range at Talcott Woods, which has a homeowners association and a neighborhood pool, said Susan Glasgall, a sales agent at Houlihan/ Lawrence in Rye.</p>
        <p>In the mid-$550,000 to $750,000 range, new houses are available at Belle Fair, a 248-home development by Spectrum Skanska. At Blind Brook Estates, a development of 40 new homes, two are available for $900,000,  each with 3,600 square feet plus an unfinished basement.</p>
        <p>Houses in the Hillandale area are the most diverse and among the most expensive: prices range from $550,000 to $1.2 million, and lot sizes from three-quarters of an acre to an acre.</p>
        <p>Besides single-family homes, town houses, condominiums and two-family houses are also available. At the Arbors, one- to four-bedroom town houses, 250 in all, range from $250,000 to $400,000. At Rye Ridge, 80 garden-style condominiums are priced from $140,000 to $180,000 for two and three bedrooms.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rogull said that there are about 100 two-family houses in the village; a three-bedroom apartment in one rents for about  $1,500 a month. At the Arbors, a two-bedroom town house rents for about $3,000.</p>
        <p>Besides the choices in housing, what makes the village unusual, and appealing to many, is its two different school districts.</p>
        <p>When Maureen Josephson and her husband, Thomas, a computer consultant, bought a house in Rye Brook in 1993, ''we wanted to live in the Port Chester school district because it was a big school district and, having boys, we wanted them to be in a big sports program,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''I didn't like the idea of my kids being with the same 50 or 60 kids starting from kindergarten,'' she added. ''I liked that they'd get to be with a lot of different kids.  It's more like real life then. When you go to college and go to work, you have to learn to get along with all kinds of people. By doing it now it becomes the norm, instead of being unusual. I like the fact that my kids go to school with some children who come in Mercedes and some in taxis.''</p>
        <p>In the Port Chester school district -- officially, the Port Chester-Rye Union Free School District -- there are four elementary schools, a middle school and a high school.  More than 60 percent of the district's 3,385 students represent minorities, many of whom are learning English as a second language, said Dr. Charles Coletti, the superintendent. ''Here we have an expectation that every child, regardless of their ethnicity, will not only reach the New York State standards but master them in every subject,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Port Chester Middle School was named a New York State School of Excellence by state's Department of Education for the 1999-2000 academic year. Dr. Coletti said the district was able to accomplish this by bringing the school and the community together, using $500,000 in federal money earmarked for improving education.</p>
        <p>''I think of our school as a large supermarket offering every convenience,'' he said. ''We've turned our schools into a one-stop center for education, community services and family services.''</p>
        <p>Among the district's more unusual offerings: the middle school has its own planetarium, and the high school has an exchange program with schools in Spain and Italy.</p>
        <p>Of the district's 166 high school graduates this year, 50 percent will go on to four-year colleges and 50 percent to two-year colleges or technical schools. On the College Board tests this year, students averaged 455 in verbal and 457 in math, compared with statewide averages of 495 in verbal and 502  in math.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the Blind Brook-Rye Union Free School District is considerably smaller, with an enrollment of 1,108. ''It's like a private school,'' said Dr. James B. Van Hoven, the superintendent. The student-faculty ratio is 12 to 1, and students are provided with ''a high-powered academic program in a very intimate setting,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''There's a tremendous amount of personal attention given by our faculty,'' he continued, ''and because of this, we also have a very strong reputation of providing excellent services for students with learning needs, too.''</p>
        <p>THE district recently spent $2.5 million on computers, and with a $16.75 million bond issue that passed in January,  the district will begin building a new middle school, with grades six through eight.</p>
        <p>Both the elementary school and the combined middle and high school have received the National Excellence Award from the federal Department of Education. High school students can choose from nine advanced-placement courses. All of the district's 56 graduates this year will go on to four-year colleges. Students averaged 617 in verbal and 635 in math on the College Board tests this year.</p>
        <p>Rye Brook has almost 100 acres of parkland. Crawford Park is the largest, with 35 acres, soccer and softball fields, day camp and after-school programs. The park, the estate of Everett and Edna Gregory Crawford, was donated to the Town of Rye in 1973, and residents can rent the Crawford mansion for parties. Residents can swim at Oakland Beach on the Long Island Sound in Rye, and next year, the village plans to open  a new teen center. There are two golf courses, a nine-hole course at Doral Arrowwood, which is open to the public on weekdays and after 2 p.m. on weekends, and an 18-hole course at the private Blind Brook Country Club.</p>
        <p>Rye Brook can trace its history to the earliest days of the American colonies. In 1660, settlers from Greenwich, Conn., negotiated a treaty with Chief Shenarockwell of the Mohican tribe, and named the area Rye after the town in East Sussex, England, the home of some of the colonists.</p>
        <p>Even after World War II, Rye Brook was a sparsely populated area of large estates, farmland and open space. By 1980, its population had grown to 8,000, said Jules Harris, the village historian, but because residents ''had only a small voice'' in the Rye Town Council, they decided to incorporate Rye Brook as a separate village.</p>
