        <p>All roads may lead to Rome, but these days not everyone traveling on them can reach downtown. Since April 6, tour buses  have not been allowed to circulate freely or park within the historic center. City officials passed the regulations to avoid potential traffic jams as many thousands of pilgrims visit Rome in the Jubilee Holy Year.</p>
        <p>Today, tour buses entering Rome must pass through one of six checkpoints on main roads into the city. (As the system becomes increasingly computerized, they will be reduced to three.) At the checkpoint, the bus is registered and upon payment of a fee, which can be paid in advance, is issued a permit. Different kinds of permits exist, some giving access to a parking spot at one of the 18 new lots inside the city limits. Most of them  are open 24 hours a day and are guarded around the clock.</p>

        <p>All roads may lead to Rome, but these days not everyone traveling on them can reach downtown. Since April 6, tour buses  have not been allowed to circulate freely or park within the historic center. City officials passed the regulations to avoid potential traffic jams as many thousands of pilgrims visit Rome in the Jubilee Holy Year.</p>
        <p>Today, tour buses entering Rome must pass through one of six checkpoints on main roads into the city. (As the system becomes increasingly computerized, they will be reduced to three.) At the checkpoint, the bus is registered and upon payment of a fee, which can be paid in advance, is issued a permit. Different kinds of permits exist, some giving access to a parking spot at one of the 18 new lots inside the city limits. Most of them  are open 24 hours a day and are guarded around the clock.</p>
        <p>In the past, tour-bus drivers would park wherever they could, and this often contributed to Rome's notoriously congested traffic. Since the measure went into effect, bus drivers found without a permit, or illegally parked, are fined.</p>
        <p>After registration, buses can circulate freely outside the third-century Aurelian walls, but they can only venture into the historic center -- delineated by the walls -- to drop off and pick up passengers near the principal tourist attractions, hotels and restaurants. The designated parking lots are within walking distance of public transportation (city buses, trams or the subway) and the new J-line Jubilee buses that connect the principal pilgrimage sites as well as Rome's monuments. There are nine J-line buses, all air-conditioned.</p>
        <p>The new regulations, which were hotly contested by tour operators and bus drivers before the city relaxed those regarding the drop-off sites and cost of the permits, have most Romans breathing a sigh of relief.</p>
