        <p>Leslie Lipton letter disputes Anthony Tommasini's June 11 article opposing sentimentality of new generation of American art song composers (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Anthony Tommasini's article about the facile, pandering, pop-influenced, non-intellectually rigorous, sentimental new generation of American art song composers [''A Sudden, Facile Flowering of American Song,'' June 11] has left my heart pounding in my chest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tommasini's compliments fall to composers whose work he describes as ''abstract,''  ''economical,''  ''astringent,''  ''complex,'' ''knotty,''  ''rigorous,''  ''jagged,'' ''pungent'' and ''lean and spiky.'' Ricky Ian Gordon is influenced by pop music. Horrors. Because his music is accessibly lyrical, he is seen as trying ''to bridge popular and concert styles.'' Horrors again. Because Emily Dickinson's ''Will There Really Be a Morning'' is, as described by Mr. Tommasini, an ''acute, unflinching poetic'' reflection, it therefore suffers from the song's lack of knots, jags, spikes and astringencies.</p>

        <p>Mr. Tommasini's compliments fall to composers whose work he describes as ''abstract,''  ''economical,''  ''astringent,''  ''complex,'' ''knotty,''  ''rigorous,''  ''jagged,'' ''pungent'' and ''lean and spiky.''

Because Emily Dickinson's ''Will There Really Be a Morning'' is, as described by Mr. Tommasini, an ''acute, unflinching poetic'' reflection, it therefore suffers from the song's lack of knots, jags, spikes and astringencies.</p>
        <p>''Will There Really Be a Morning'' is set in a breathtaking sweep of sadness and longing by Mr. Gordon, written, undoubtedly, in a burst of emotion that disqualifies it from Mr. Tommasini's high regard. That Mr. Gordon's sophisticated and original songwriting is beautiful, and moving, and a product in part of its times is O.K. with this little pilgrim. A song need not be inaccessible, ''knotty,'' ''spiky'' or ''jagged'' to be challenging -- or to be art.</p>
