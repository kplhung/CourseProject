        <p>In her letter published June 25 [''Even Background Levels of Radiation Are Harmful''], Miriam Goodman assumes, incorrectly, that I am uninformed about potential health hazards of low-level radiation.</p>
        <p>She missed the point of my earlier letter. I know about these hazards, but I still have dental X-rays when needed. Life includes many unavoidable risks.</p>
        <p>A real reduction of the level of ''natural'' ionizing radiation would bankrupt the country. I did not argue against a cleanup of nuclear waste, but there comes a point of diminishing returns. The nuclear waste at Brookhaven National Laboratory approaches this point: It is worth noting that some of the lowest levels of natural radiation background have been achieved at Brookhaven Lab.</p>
        <p>My suggestion to anyone concerned about natural radiation is that they are free to spend their own money to try to clean up the radiation in their own backyards. I do not like to see tax money wasted. If they cannot find any radioactivity in their soil, they can work on a cosmic radiation shield for their homes.</p>
