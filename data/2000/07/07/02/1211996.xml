        <p>A Queens woman fell off a subway platform in the Union Square station in Manhattan early yesterday and was killed by an oncoming train, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The woman, Carolyn Waldron, 25, an advocate for the homeless mentally ill at the Urban Justice Center in Manhattan, was waiting for a train just before 2 a.m. when she fell, apparently accidentally, the police said. At least five people saw the incident and said Ms. Waldron, who lived on 44th Street in Queens, had not been pushed, the police said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Waldron had spent the evening at the Stuyvesant Town apartment of a friend, Joanne Messina, who said Ms. Waldron left about 1:30 a.m. to go home, the police said. Ms. Messina said the two had watched movies together and her friend had not been depressed or despondent.</p>
        <p>Ms. Waldron, who majored in American studies at Fordham University and planned to go to law school, grew up in Upper Darby Township, Pa., where her family lives. Ms. Messina said she had known her for five or six years.</p>
