        <p>Believers in the biblical injunction against building houses on sand found an ally in the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which published an analysis of shoreline building with an alarming conclusion: a quarter of the houses within 500 feet of the coasts on the ocean and Great Lakes are in danger of falling to the waves in the next 60 years.</p>

But advocates for coastal dwellers called the report a thinly disguised attempt to drive residents from the beach.</p>
