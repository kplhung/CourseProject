        <p>THERE are the investment bankers who talk of things like deficit figures and inflation targets when discussing Brazil, Latin America's largest economy. Then there are the bankers, like Francisco Gros, who talk of Miss Piggy.</p>
        <p>As a high-ranking executive at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Mr. Gros wrote in an online newsletter late last year that ''we Brazilians suffer from what could be called 'Miss Piggy' syndrome -- we believe ourselves to be wonderful, while others, unfortunately, do not see us quite that way.''</p>

        <p>THERE are the investment bankers who talk of things like deficit figures and inflation targets when discussing Brazil, Latin America's largest economy. Then there are the bankers, like Francisco Gros, who talk of Miss Piggy.</p>
        <p>As a high-ranking executive at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Mr. Gros wrote in an online newsletter late last year that ''we Brazilians suffer from what could be called 'Miss Piggy' syndrome -- we believe ourselves to be wonderful, while others, unfortunately, do not see us quite that way.''</p>
        <p>As one of Brazil's leading figures on Wall Street, Mr. Gros developed a reputation for talking tough. Now, however, he is toning down his approach after being named in February to one of the most coveted posts in Brazil's government, the presidency of the country's powerful development bank.</p>
        <p>''I hope that stuff doesn't come back to haunt me,'' said Mr. Gros, who is 57.</p>
        <p>He probably does not have much to worry about, given his reputation as a consummate insider among the coterie of Ivy League-educated economists, bankers and academics who have run Brazil for much of the past decade. But many other Brazilians question whether their interests are best served by a group of bankers bent on globalization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gros says he wants the bank to temper its worldly investing approach with a renewed emphasis on lending to small and medium-sized companies. But the bank still concentrates on supporting major companies in industries like steel and telecommunications.</p>
        <p>Among Brazil's worldly group of financiers, perhaps no one is worldlier than Mr. Gros. The son of a French diplomat, he grew up on three continents, in Brazil, France and the United States, and attended  Princeton as an undergraduate. After graduate school in economics at Columbia, he returned to Brazil and began a career in the high-flying financial circles of Rio de Janeiro.</p>
        <p>Soon, he began playing the game of musical chairs that is familiar in Brazil, in which leading figures from the private sector accept high-profile jobs in government, then return to the private sector.</p>
        <p>Between stints as an executive at Unibanco, one of Brazil's largest banks, and as president of Aracruz Celulose S.A., a large manufacturer of eucalyptus pulp used in paper products, Mr. Gros served twice as president of the country's central bank. He was also a partner in a small investment bank, Banco BFC S.A.</p>
        <p>After his last term at the central bank, which ended in 1992, he returned to the private sector. He joined Morgan Stanley as its chairman for Latin America, helping to build the institution into a leading investment banking presence in the region.</p>
        <p>Jetting between his homes in New York and Rio, Mr. Gros became a fixture on network television here, discussing the direction of the world's ninth-largest economy. His candid assessment of Brazil's challenges made him a favorite among journalists.</p>
        <p>So few people were surprised by his appointment by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to head the National Bank for Economic and Social Development, a multilayered institution that rivals international lending organizations like the World Bank in its size. It is known as the B.N.D.E.S., its initials in Portuguese.</p>
        <p>With the exception of Banco do Brasil S.A., another institution controlled by the government that focuses more on consumer banking, the development bank is probably the most powerful financial institution in Brazil.</p>
        <p>''It is a banker's dream to run the B.N.D.E.S.,'' said Edmar Bacha, a former president of the development bank who now heads the New York office of Banco BBA-Creditanstalt. ''It is the only domestic provider of long-term capital, and its size makes it one of the most powerful institutions, financial or otherwise, in the country.''</p>
        <p>The bank has the largest lending budget of any Brazilian bank, at nearly 24 billion reais, or $13.2 billion. During the Cardoso administration, which began in 1995, a fivefold increase in its government support  transformed the bank from a financier of infrastructure projects into the main arm of economic policy.</p>
        <p>As Brazil opened its economy to foreign investment and competition, the bank was there at every step. The bank guided the world's largest privatization program in the 1990's, selling some $90 billion of state assets. Often, this role put it in touch with the world's leading investment banks, which competed to handle the sales.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Gros's tutelage, Morgan Stanley won one such contract, serving as co-manager with Salomon Smith Barney for the $21 billion privatization of Brazil's telecommunications monopoly in 1998.</p>
        <p>Through its investment banking unit, modeled on the International Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the World Bank, the development bank financed many of these takeovers.</p>
        <p>In fact, the freewheeling use of its funds, which it provided to companies regardless of their national origin, has been a major source of criticism by opponents of the government's privatization program. Last week in Brasilia, left-wing congressmen moved to limit the bank's financing capabilities in privatization deals.</p>
        <p>''I don't see why a public institution in a poor country like Brazil is providing money to foreign companies that have cheap access to borrowing overseas,'' said Aloizio Mercadante, a Sao Paulo congressman from the Workers Party.</p>
        <p>Because of the bank's big role in guiding policy, Mr. Gros will have to mitigate the tension resulting from a government seeking to rapidly modernize the economy and an opposition questioning whether Brazil is bending too far in its rush to globalization.</p>
        <p>''Brazil is at a stage in which it needs something more than people who see the country as a balance sheet,'' said Clovis Rossi, a columnist for Folha de Sao Paulo, Brazil's most widely read newspaper. ''It may be that neo-nationalists don't help the economy to grow further, but a collection of bankers does not seem to be the best alternative.''</p>
        <p>TO be sure, Mr. Gros is not alone among high-ranking officials in having a background in international finance. The central bank president, Arminio Fraga, a close friend, is a former hedge fund manager for George Soros. Another former banker, Development Minister Alcides Tapias, is Mr. Gros's immediate superior.</p>
        <p>''We're a cosmopolitan bunch, but that alone is not enough,'' Mr. Gros said. ''Accepting the inevitability of an open economy and preparing Brazil for a growing global role are the challenges ahead.''</p>
