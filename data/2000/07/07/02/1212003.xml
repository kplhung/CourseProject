        <p>Col R Kliemann letter defends Atlanta Braves relief pitcher John Rocker for his incendiary comments about homosexuals and minorities blaming instead author of article in Sports Illustrated and attendant media frenzy (S)</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>In the case of John Rocker, it appears that a young man who would probably classify as a redneck spent a number of hours with a reporter who had an agenda. Being young, full of testosterone and naive, Rocker did not know how to play the interview game. He has paid a terrible price for verbalization of individual biases. A big segment of the news media is now exploiting political correctness for all it's worth. This poor young fool has nowhere to hide from the scrutiny of public focus. The crushing national news media response against this young man's foolish statements is unwarranted.</p>
        <p>Stop! Leave John Rocker's baseball career in the hands of whatever talent he has.</p>

        <p>Play fair. Examine the intent of the clown who wrote the article.</p>
        <p>Examine the intent of those who relentlessly pursue the issue. The excitation of revenge ultimately causes more physical and emotional casualties than minor stupid statements. Forgiveness rarely causes damage.</p>
