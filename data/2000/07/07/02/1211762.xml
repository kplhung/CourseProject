        <p>THE hit television show ''Survivor'' is credited with rejuvenating CBS, attracting loads of those coveted viewers between 18 and 49. That means the network, which mature Americans have long called their own, can now sell more ads at higher prices.</p>
        <p>What remains difficult to understand is why Network Row and Madison Avenue think young eyeballs are worth more to them than older ones.</p>
        <p>Consider these statistics:</p>
        <p>* Seven baby boomers will turn 50 every minute until 2014, according to American Demographics magazine.</p>
        <p>* People over 50 have half the nation's disposable income, and those over 65 enjoy twice the discretionary income of people 25 to 34, according to Theodore Roszak, the author of ''America the Wise: The Longevity Revolution and the True Wealth of Nations.''</p>
        <p>* The net worth of households headed by people over 60 grew by 30 percent over the last decade, double the national average, according to a recent survey by the University of Michigan.</p>
        <p>So what's going on? Why are advertisers acting like a bunch of anti-Willie Suttons, aiming where the money increasingly isn't?</p>
        <p>Mr. Roszak suggests that corporate America and its media are at war with the Census Bureau. In a 1998 article in Civilization, the magazine of the Library of Congress, he put it succinctly: ''The young are a vanishing breed. The future lies with the old.''</p>
        <p>While war may be too strong a metaphor, and the young aren't really about to vanish, there is little doubt that the advertising industry is generally well behind the curve of America's changing demographic landscape. And the reason may lie in the demographics of the advertising business, where many decisions are made by people in their 20's and 30's who have only the vaguest notion of, or interest in, life past 50.</p>
        <p>Ann A. Fishman, 58, the president of the Generational-Targeted Marketing Corporation in New Orleans, recalls a meeting she once had at an ad agency in New York. ''I was struck by the fact that every person I met except one was young,'' she said. ''But you can't have one age group watching the store. You wind up not being sensitive to the various generational groups.''</p>
        <p>Nowhere is the disconnect between Madison Avenue and demographic reality more obvious than inside the covers of Modern Maturity, published every other month by AARP. The magazine has two versions, for working and retired subscribers, and a total circulation of 20.5 million, the largest of any magazine and almost double each of its two closest competitors, Reader's Digest and TV Guide, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. By further comparison, Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping have a circulation of 4.5 million each; Time magazine's is 4.1 million.</p>
        <p>But you would never guess the circulation of Modern Maturity from its advertising volume. Publications aimed at younger people -- like women's fashion magazines, or Maxim for young men, or Fast Company or Red Herring, which focus on technology, business and the Internet -- attract so much advertising that they can be as fat as phone books. But not Modern Maturity.</p>
        <p>Some of this youth-market myopia, however, is likely to fade as the 80 million baby boomers and their money decamp into the golden years.</p>
        <p>Bill Novelli, associate executive director of public affairs for AARP, says Modern Maturity is trying to position itself to rise with the boomer tide. In 1998, the organization ditched its old name, the American Association of Retired Persons. Surveys and focus groups show that boomers hate words like ''retired'' that remind them of ''old.'' And a lot of people in their 60's and 70's don't think of themselves as old, either.</p>
        <p>''There are big changes coming in the magazine,'' he said. ''It's going to become more of a lifestyle magazine, more vibrant and youthful in its aim. We think we have enough elasticity to appeal to both the 55-year-olds and the 75-year-olds.'' Recent covers, featuring celebrities like Paul Newman, Judge Judy and Cheryl Tiegs, are signals of the changes, he said.</p>
        <p>He also said executives are considering a switch to monthly publication, the addition of newsstand sales and, perhaps, a change in name.</p>
        <p>The repositioning will make the magazine more boomer-friendly just as the advertising industry is about to be jerked into reality by that aging group and its buying power.</p>
        <p>''Media buyers and media planners are young,'' Mr. Novelli said. ''A mind change has to take place. But they are awakening.''</p>
        <p>And yet: Modern Maturity, which already charges advertisers about one-third as much per subscriber as Time does, is considering cutting its ad rates.</p>
