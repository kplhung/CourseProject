        <p>AMONG the city's neighborhoods, Brooklyn Heights is a jewel. The city's first landmarked historic district, its quiet ambience suggests a backward trip in time. Film makers frequently use streets like Joralemon Street to evoke early New York.  Yet Brooklyn Heights has major problems. As one of the city's oldest neighborhoods, it lacks open green park space, and its narrow streets are often clogged with traffic.</p>
        <p>Now this district is threatened by an ill-conceived plan for massive commercial development on the 75-acre waterfront strip that abuts the neighborhood. This plan for a Brooklyn Bridge Park is overloaded with elements that don't belong in a public park -- a 370-room hotel, conference center, parking lot for 1,500 cars, commercial recreation facilities, art galleries, office space, boutiques and a dozen restaurants -- in addition to the usual amenities you want to find in a park, like playing fields, a skating rink and a swimming pool.</p>

        <p>AMONG the city's neighborhoods, Brooklyn Heights is a jewel. The city's first landmarked historic district, its quiet ambience suggests a backward trip in time. Film makers frequently use streets like Joralemon Street to evoke early New York.  Yet Brooklyn Heights has major problems. As one of the city's oldest neighborhoods, it lacks open green park space, and its narrow streets are often clogged with traffic.</p>
        <p>Now this district is threatened by an ill-conceived plan for massive commercial development on the 75-acre waterfront strip that abuts the neighborhood. This plan for a Brooklyn Bridge Park is overloaded with elements that don't belong in a public park -- a 370-room hotel, conference center, parking lot for 1,500 cars, commercial recreation facilities, art galleries, office space, boutiques and a dozen restaurants -- in addition to the usual amenities you want to find in a park, like playing fields, a skating rink and a swimming pool.</p>
        <p>Imagine the outcry if anyone should propose the building of hotels, parking lots and shopping facilities in Central Park or Prospect Park!  Central Park, with 843 acres, or Prospect Park, with 526, could far more easily accommodate them than these 75 acres.</p>
        <p>The new mantra in planning for public parks, it seems, is that they must pay for themselves. Every public-minded citizen should fight this claim. The existence of parks should not depend on selling or leasing public space to for-profit enterprises.</p>
        <p>Instead of fighting for the public nature of a public park, however,  civic groups and elected officials in Brooklyn have acquiesced. They brook no dissent to their plan to build a hotel and parking lot on the borough's precious waterfront. They must recognize that a lot for 1,500 cars will draw even more automobiles to a community already choked with traffic. It is incomprehensible that the project's planners do not rely on mass transit.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the plan's most objectionable feature is that it will funnel pedestrians to the park through Joralemon Street, a quiet residential street that culminates in a cobblestone block with narrow sidewalks.  The thousands of people who would travel that street each day from the subway to the park will not be able to stop for a cup of coffee because most of Joralemon is lined by private landmarked houses. An alternative park design has been drawn up by the architect Donald M. Rattner. He  maintains that it makes far more sense to build a pedestrian bridge that would connect the new park to  Montague Street, the main street of Brooklyn Heights, whose shops, coffee bars and restaurants would welcome a pedestrian influx.</p>
        <p>Defenders of the current park plan claim that critics are simply resisting ''progress,'' that they want to ''turn back the clock.'' They forget that the advocates of progress are sometimes wrong, as when they wrapped Manhattan in highways, cutting off public access to most of its waterfront.</p>
        <p>Sometimes it is right to resist progress, especially when progress threatens grievous damage to a community that has prided itself on preserving its history. The current plan's critics, like Waterfront Development Watch, do want a park, but they don't want South Street Seaport or Chelsea Piers. They want a beautiful space open to the public, where people may enjoy vistas of the city and its harbor, where children can play in fresh air, surrounded by trees and grass. They want a real park.</p>
