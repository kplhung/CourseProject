        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While Graham Fuller's appreciation of Billy Wilder's wonderful ''Apartment'' [''An Undervalued American Classic,'' June 18] was certainly not unwelcome, I hardly think a film which was a critical and commercial success, won six Oscars (including best picture) and is universally regarded as the capstone of its writer-director's career (after 1960 Wilder never again connected with the public and the critics on the same film) can be termed ''undervalued.'' A list of truly overlooked and underappreciated Wilder films (titles which are completely unknown to the public at large, though gaining widespread critical favor) would have to include ''A Foreign Affair'' (1948), ''Ace in the Hole'' (1951), ''Kiss Me Stupid'' (1964), ''The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes'' (1970) and ''Avanti!'' (1972).</p>
