        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for focusing on the matter of the small town of Holmdel against the huge Southland Corporation and our yearlong efforts to stop the proposed location of their 7-Eleven store adjacent to the New School of Monmouth County.</p>
        <p>The children in this conflict have provided the most sobering viewpoint in this unwieldy process.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for focusing on the matter of the small town of Holmdel against the huge Southland Corporation and our yearlong efforts to stop the proposed location of their 7-Eleven store adjacent to the New School of Monmouth County.</p>
        <p>The children in this conflict have provided the most sobering viewpoint in this unwieldy process. These children, ranging in from 5 to 14 years old, have gotten a first-hand education in something not usually taught in the classrooms: local politics. Often a confused child would turn to another during the endless testimony and cut to the chase:</p>
        <p>''Don't they know there's a school next door? Don't they care about their delivery trucks coming so close to our playground?''</p>
        <p>Many good points were presented during these community meetings, pertaining to the loss of property values for adjacent homeowners; the dangers of stop-and-go-traffic on this corner, already notorious for accidents; the undersized dimensions of the proposed parking lot; and the plan of the founding fathers of Holmdel to purposefully keep 24-hour stores out of this peaceful town. But the most touching argument comes from the children, against whose very lives Southland is betting.</p>
