        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a composer, and also director of the Aviva Players, a 25-year-old concert series that performs songs and chamber music by female composers of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, I was delighted and encouraged to read of the continued power of art songs. Anthony Tommasini's knowledgably optimistic article gives an overview of American songs from this past century, heard in wonderful recent concerts such as the New York Festival of Songs and the ones to which Ned Rorem played host at the 92nd Street Y. Sadly not heard in these celebrations were any songs by female composers. Missing from these programs and lists are songs by the American composers Amy Beach, Vivian Fine, Miriam Gideon, Mary Howe, Ursula Mamlok, Lou Rodgers, Jeanne Singer, Julia Smith, Joyce Susskind, Joelle Wallach, Judith Zaimont -- to name just a few. By the year 2000 women as poets, playwrights, novelists, directors, choreographers and designers are in the public's mainstream -- but who will sing our songs?</p>
