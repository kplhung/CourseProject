        <p>Wandering through Burlington County's Old Prison, it is not hard to imagine prisoners in the 19th century locked up behind inch-thick oak and iron-banded doors inside their tiny fireplace-heated cells with little to do but contemplate their fate.</p>
        <p>It is far more difficult to envision the life of those inmates who were still incarcerated here in 1965, the last year the 154-year-old building served as the county jail.</p>
        <p>Situated along historic High Street here, the jail continued to draw curiosity seekers for years after it no longer housed prisoners, but a leaking roof, chipping lead-based paint and arcane plumbing forced the county to close the building in 1993. Now, with an $850,000 face lift, the building -- designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987 -- is again open, though as a museum.</p>
        <p>One of the earliest examples of modern prison architecture, the county jail was designed by Robert Mills, then 26 years old and the country's first professionally trained architect. The Burlington County Jail was one of his earliest commissions. He later served as Architect of Public Buildings and designed the Washington Monument, the Treasury building, the United States Post Office and the United States Patent Office.</p>
        <p>The need for a new county jail arose in 1796, when the county seat was moved from Burlington City to Mount Holly. But it took the county freeholders another 11 years to purchase land adjacent to the courthouse,  where the new prison would be built. In 1808 they commissioned Mills to draw up plans.</p>
        <p>Under the influence of the British architect Benjamin Latrobe, who was a pioneer in modern penology, and the Quaker Friends Society, who were leaders in prison reform and who also had an active presence in Burlington County at the time, Mills believed that a prison's design could have a rehabilitative effect on its inhabitants.</p>
        <p>His plans for a new jail incorporated such radical notions as providing individual cells where prisoners could reflect and repent, creating cellblocks to separate hardened criminals from those who might be serving a sentence for unpaid debt, providing light and heat within the cells and developing a work program for inmates to learn a skill.</p>
        <p>When the jail opened in 1811, at a cost of $24,201 -- more than double the budgeted price of $10,000 -- it was considered a great success, except for the work program, which never functioned very well, said Janet Sozio, president of the Historic Burlington County Prison Museum Association, the organization that runs the newly opened prison museum.</p>
        <p>''This was the 'factory' where they'd make baskets, and shoes and shingles,'' said Ms. Sozio, pointing to a large open space on the ground floor of the old prison. ''Mills had the idea that you could rehabilitate these people if you taught them a trade. But most of them had been arrested for drunkenness or vagrancy, so they were they were only in here for a week or 10 days. You can't rehabilitate someone in that time.''</p>
        <p>By the time the old prison closed, the ''factory'' had been turned into a bunk room for the road crew, where as many as 20 prisoners shared the space, Ms. Sozio said. Originally designed for about 40 prisoners, the jail was holding close to 100 inmates before it closed in the mid-1960's.</p>
        <p>Dave Kimball, a retired historian with the National Park Service who is now vice president of the Prison Museum Association, has pieced together details of prison life by going through the jail's daily logs and commitment books, which date from the late 1800's. Mothers were at times committed with their nursing babies, men were jailed for adultery and fornication, and using the bathroom at the end of the cellblock was a privilege, not a right.</p>
        <p>''If you were on good behavior, you got to use the bathroom,'' Mr. Kimball said. ''If you acted up, you were handed a bucket and sent back to your cell.''</p>
        <p>The jail's restoration was begun in 1993, when a new red cedar shake shingled roof was put on. Phase two was an arduous lead paint abatement project, while the latest phase, completed last month, included all new lighting and plumbing, replastering and painting of all interior surfaces, and the installation of a wheelchair lift and handicapped-access bathroom to comply with county and federal requirements for public buildings.</p>
        <p>With all the work completed, the stone and brick building is expected to be a popular tourist destination for this sleepy county seat. Mr. Kimball, Ms. Sozio and anyone else they can get to volunteer as a docent will lead tours through the prison's three floors on the last Saturday and Sunday of each month from May through September. Ms. Sozio expects to expand the schedule when they get more volunteers. She is also hoping that people will come forward with memorabilia from the old prison so the association can mount exhibitions within the now largely empty space.</p>
        <p>Now, visitors are escorted through the work room, the kitchen and the cellblocks, where they can see a sample of inmate graffiti from the 19th century, plus the maximum-security cell with an iron bolt for chaining a prisoner's leg to the floor. The warden's quarters contain the log books and photographs of some of the more famous prisoners, like Albert DeSalvo, later known as the Boston Strangler, who while stationed at nearby Fort Dix was charged in 1955 with molesting a young girl in Pemberton and sent to the county jail. He was let off, since, as Ms. Sozio said, ''in those days, people weren't able to bring charges against someone for child molestation.''</p>
        <p>The tour ends in the prison yard, where, until 1905, scaffolding was erected on several occasions for public hangings. Now it is a grassy, tree-filled space, the only reminder of its original identity the surrounding 20-foot stone wall, which many prisoners escaped over, according to Mr. Kimball.</p>
        <p>''The place was a sieve,'' said the 70-year-old historian. ''Some simply walked out the front door. Others would tear up their sheets and turn them into ropes that they threw over the wall. Most of the time, only one warden was on duty, so, given the best will in the world, there was no way he could supervise all the cells.''</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Brennan remembers the somewhat lax attitude at the jail in its final years when her father, Frances (Luke) Brennan, was county sheriff and jail warden. Stopping by on a Saturday, her father left her in the basement kitchen to be served a piece of cake by the cook, who she later learned had been charged with murder.</p>
        <p>''I was about 8 and I was a little worried that my father would leave me with a murderer,'' said Ms. Brennan. ''But he assured me that people only kill people they know, and since he didn't know me, I was safe.''</p>
