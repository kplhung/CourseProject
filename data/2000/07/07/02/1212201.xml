        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>Scene: Bedroom of a young couple watching ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' The show ends and the lights go off.</p>
        <p>He: ''I'm feeling very amorous tonight. How about you?''</p>
        <p>She: ''No, I have a headache.''</p>
        <p>He: ''Is that your final answer?''</p>
        <p>She: ''Yes.''</p>
        <p>He: ''I think I'd like to phone a friend.''  JOYCE JOSEPH</p>
        <p>And in that vein, on the back of a black leather jacket worn by a burly and bearded motorcyclist was this  message: ''If you can read this, she fell off.''</p>
        <p>INFLATION</p>
        <p>Today I bought a two-door for</p>
        <p>What Father bought a Tudor for.</p>
        <p>BOB McKENTY</p>
        <p>Overheard on a recent Sunday at the Clifton Commons mall, one young man to another: ''I was thinking of going running, but I don't run.''</p>
        <p>Passing by a cashier at the Sears in Livingstone Mall recently, I could not help but notice a customer who was having a lively conversation with her friend. She was waving her arms, and it was clear that she was upset with something or somebody.</p>
        <p>I only heard her final words' ''People are worse than anybody.''</p>
        <p>DORIS L. MEYER</p>
        <p>SWITCHEROO</p>
        <p>For Mother's Day they gave her aprons,</p>
        <p>Frilly things of pink and blue.</p>
        <p>On Father's Day, for his suit pocket,</p>
        <p>Silken hankies of every hue</p>
        <p>Regarding each other with eyebrows lifted,</p>
        <p>And pondering whether the kids would feel bad</p>
        <p>They quietly switched what they had been gifted,</p>
        <p>This corporate Mom and stay-at-home Dad.</p>
        <p>MARILYN COHEN VASEN</p>
        <p>I am waiting my turn recently at a dry cleaners in Denville when the first customer in line, a girl of 13 or 14, places a badly stained jacket on the counter.</p>
        <p>''I need your service,'' she says.</p>
        <p>With that, the clerk regards the large brown stain.</p>
        <p>''Chocolate ice cream,'' the girl says. ''I took my sister's jacket without her permission and got ice cream all over it. I need it cleaned and back in the closet before she finds out.''</p>
        <p>''I hear you,'' he says.</p>
        <p>AUDREY CORN</p>
        <p>At the Short Hills Mall, shoppers have tried to follow the frequent addition of new shops and the ever-changing location of older ones. Now even the employees there are confused.</p>
        <p>For example, while having lunch at Bloomingdale's recently, a store employee approached as I sought out the grilled veggies at the salad bar.</p>
        <p>Employee: ''Can you tell me where you found that great skirt?''</p>
        <p>Me: ''In my closet.''</p>
        <p>Employee: ''And what level is that on.''</p>
        <p>MARILYN COHEN VASEN</p>
        <p>POSTCARD  FROM SEA GIRT</p>
        <p>''The seashore's shrinking!'' ecologists roar.</p>
        <p>''It's shrinking, receding,'' they screech.</p>
        <p>No news to me, fellas. Come look at my floor,</p>
        <p>And see what's become of the missing seashore --</p>
        <p>I'm sweeping it back to the beach.</p>
