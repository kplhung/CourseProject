        <p>AMANDA PARKER has gotten the news. Pilot Career Consultants, the Glastonbury company for which she works as an office assistant, will be open for business tomorrow, the day that is the key to this long July 4 weekend.</p>
        <p>That's fine with her, though. Open or not, she doesn't plan to be there.</p>
        <p>Ms. Parker told her boss she's taking that day off. She plans to spend her time looking for a new apartment, a task better suited for a four-day period than for a weekend and a spare day in the middle of the week. ''That gives me four straight days to get things done,'' Ms. Parker said.</p>
        <p>July 3 has become for many an important part of the Independence Day break this year, as many Connecticut workers question the idea of coming in for a single day in between days off. And companies have responded in different ways.</p>
        <p>July 4 is a federal holiday, so all federal and state agencies will get a paid vacation day. In private companies, according to the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, 54 percent of Connecticut employees will get July 4 off as a paid holiday. (The group said the number would be higher if the holiday had fallen on a Monday or Friday.) Getting off the day before, however, is another matter; only 16 percent of Connecticut employees are given off July 3 as well.</p>
        <p>Priceline in Norwalk, for example, will be closed on Tuesday, but expects employees to work tomorrow. People who want tomorrow off will have to take a vacation day. At the South Beach Beverage Company, also known as SoBe, in Norwalk, employees can choose which day they want off as a paid holiday, they just can't take both without using up a vacation day. Patricia Solum, director of human resources at Sobe, said that because policies differ from company to company, some people would get the day off and others would not.</p>
        <p>''This is the most messed up holiday,'' Ms. Solum said. ''July 4 always floats, so it's a pain in the neck. It's a problem for morale; people have a lot of things going on with their families, and if people have different days off, it creates problems sometimes.''</p>
        <p>Tom Morton, a SoBe marketing representative, is taking tomorrow and Tuesday off. He plans to spend tomorrow with his parents watching the fireworks at Short Beach in Stratford.</p>
        <p>''My parents and friends are showing up at noon Monday, and we're just going to eat and get drunk all day,'' Mr. Morton said. ''We won't have to go anywhere; you just lay on your back, look up and you can see the fireworks from right behind my parents' house.''</p>
        <p>Some state offices will also be closed tomorrow, but the decision whether to shut down is up to the person running each office. At the University of Connecticut School of Social Work in West Hartford, for example, the dean exercised his option to close the school because a majority of employees will use a vacation day tomorrow and the office would have been short staffed.</p>
        <p>''Nearly everyone requested that day off,'' said Bruce Parkhurst, the director of finance and administration for the school. ''When I went back and talked to those who wanted to work, they saw how few people would be here and decided they didn't want to, either.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Parkhurst's plans, his July 3 will include time with his family. ''I'll just be doing stuff with my kids,'' he said. ''The theme parks will be packed to the hilt, I'm sure, so we'll probably just end up doing things in town. We'll go to the pool, maybe take a trip to the beach.''</p>
        <p>One company used July 3 as a means to get employee feedback. William Mercer, a human resources consulting firm in Stamford, gave the day off as an incentive for filling out a company-wide survey. The company, which has more than 40 of its worldwide offices in the United States, surveys workers on issues that affect them. As an incentive for workers to complete the survey, they promised tomorrow off as a paid holiday if 95 percent of workers in the United States filled out the survey. It turned out that the company got a 98 percent response, so they were given the day off.</p>
        <p>Virginia Decker, a spokeswoman for William Mercer, said the vacation day was the best motivation to get responses. ''Because many people have floating holidays, they often take that day off,'' she said. ''It's an in-depth survey, and we felt a vacation day would be a good incentive to get workers to complete it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Decker pointed out that methods of encouragement like these are a proven way to hire and retain strong employees. By giving workers what they want in vacation, the company gets what they want in employee feedback.</p>
        <p>''We believe in this so much, we do this survey every other year,'' Ms. Decker said. ''You have to know what people like and what they don't like, and incentives like that are instrumental in getting the response rates so high.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Parker of Pilot Career Consultants said she knows clients will be contacting her company tomorrow, but she also knows the value of a long weekend. ''As much as I'd like to be available to the clients,'' she said, ''I need that extra day to take care of a few things myself.''</p>
