        <p>Fresh from a victory with the return of Elian Gonzalez, President Fidel Castro vowed today to press a nationwide campaign for changing American policy toward Cuba, but suggested that he did not expect immediate success with either of the candidates to succeed Bill Clinton in the White House.</p>
        <p>''Neither of them inspires any confidence whatsoever,'' Mr. Castro said in a written message read at the first rally since Elian returned home on Wednesday. ''Whoever is the next president of the United States should know that here is Cuba with its ideas, its example and the rebelliousness of its people; that all aggression and all attempts to asphyxiate us or put us on our knees will be defeated.''</p>

        <p>Fresh from a victory with the return of Elian Gonzalez, President Fidel Castro vowed today to press a nationwide campaign for changing American policy toward Cuba, but suggested that he did not expect immediate success with either of the candidates to succeed Bill Clinton in the White House.</p>
        <p>''Neither of them inspires any confidence whatsoever,'' Mr. Castro said in a written message read at the first rally since Elian returned home on Wednesday. ''Whoever is the next president of the United States should know that here is Cuba with its ideas, its example and the rebelliousness of its people; that all aggression and all attempts to asphyxiate us or put us on our knees will be defeated.''</p>
        <p>A crowd estimated by officials at 300,000 packed the plaza of this historic town to hear a succession of speakers inveigh against the American trade embargo, which they said had caused billions of dollars of economic damage, and the Cuban Adjustment Act, which grants asylum to Cubans who reach American soil.</p>
        <p>The crowd was told that that Cubans had to channel the same energy they used in the last seven months to call for Elian's return into a renewed fight against policies that the speakers said had weakened Cuba's economy and led people like Elian's mother to take to the sea in risky attempts to flee.</p>
        <p>''Now begins the second stage that will also be triumphant,'' Raul Castro, the minister of the armed forces and the president's brother, said after the rally. ''What other solution do we have? What other solution do the Americans have? Invade us? I would not like to see that because we would pay a terrible price. But they would pay as terrible a price as we have.''</p>
        <p>Just as he promised not to change their tactics, he insisted that there would be no change in Cuba's political system despite the speculation about what might happen when Mr. Castro, 72, dies.</p>
        <p>''Now they talk about the famous transition,'' he said at a 15-minute news conference. ''I have read hundreds of articles about that famous transition. Who will come after Castro? Will his brother be able to control the situation? Here, anybody can control the situation. You cannot cover the sun with your finger.''</p>
        <p>That theme has been sounded often in the last seven months, as the Cuban government found, for the first time in many years, that it had the overwhelming support of its people on the emotional issue of uniting a motherless boy with his father. Most of the people at the rally wore tiny pictures of Elian in the arms of his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>Behind the crowd, a billboard featured a quote from Jose Marti, the 19th-century poet and Cuban nationalist. ''I am son of my son,'' read the quote. ''In him I am reborn.''</p>
        <p>By trying to harness the rejoicing for the Gonzalez family and its victory, officials hoped to renew their revolution. Despite rumors that Mr. Gonzalez would be at the rally, he was at a seaside Havana house where his son and several friends are staying. Officials have insisted they would not use the boy in any public appearances. But they invoked the family's example often.</p>
        <p>''Those who thought we would get tired have learned the reality,'' Felipe Perez Roque, the foreign minister, told the rally. ''On a day like today we affectionately congratulate Juan Miguel Gonzalez, an exemplary father and son of a people who struggled for a noble cause, not just for his son, but to show that you cannot use a child for political manipulation.''</p>
        <p>The rally leavened harsh political talk with dance and music, including pieces in a traditional rural song style with improvised verses about Elian, the embargo and other issues. During the speeches, the rustle of tens of thousands of paper flags waved by the crowd was more common than applause.</p>
        <p>People said they agreed with the goals of the new campaign, often repeating the same phrases about ''doing away with the unjust laws.''</p>
        <p>In recent days, a number of Havana residents had said they needed a break after too many months of hectoring the United States.</p>
        <p>''They get taken to the rallies and they shout, 'Elian! Elian!''' said one man who declined to identify himself. ''This has been enough. They take you there and give you flags. It's like we're in a spaceship here.''</p>
