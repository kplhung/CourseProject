        <p>IN a move that promises to make one of South America's lesser-known tourist destinations more appealing to American visitors, Ecuador, whose attractions include the Galapagos Islands, spectacular volcanoes and Amazon jungle, is abandoning its currency, the sucre, in favor of the dollar.

        <p>IN a move that promises to make one of South America's lesser-known tourist destinations more appealing to American visitors, Ecuador, whose attractions include the Galapagos Islands, spectacular volcanoes and Amazon jungle, is abandoning its currency, the sucre, in favor of the dollar. Both currencies are in use at the moment, but the transition to the dollar is expected to be complete by September.</p>
        <p>The shift comes after the value of the sucre dropped from 6,200 to the dollar at the beginning of 1999 to 25,000 to the dollar in January of this year, when dollarization was decreed. That plunge in value made Ecuador probably the biggest bargain for visitors to Latin America, a distinction it is likely to retain for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>''As a result of the drastic devaluation that occurred in the year leading up to dollarization, the price of our packages was reduced 15 to 20 percent,'' said Pablo Burbano, president of Metropolitan Touring, a leading travel agency in Quito, the Ecuadorean capital. ''The dollar goes a long way here, and even though dollarization means things will get a little more expensive, we are going to continue to be a cheap destination for the next few years.''</p>
        <p>For American tourists, the new system  simplifies typical tourist transactions. ''Visitors are not going to have to worry anymore about changing money or things like what the commission is on traveler's checks compared to cash,'' said Maria Carmen Granizo, president of the Ecuadorean Association of Tourism Companies, a trade group. ''All they need to do is bring their dollars and use them directly.''</p>
        <p>Ecuador is not the first country in Latin America to adopt the dollar as its national currency. Panama did so soon after gaining its independence from Colombia in 1903, and Argentina in recent years has maintained the peso at a one-to-one parity with the dollar; the two currencies can be used almost interchangeably.</p>
        <p>But in Ecuador, an Andean country of 12.5 million people notorious for its political and economic volatility, the shift to the dollar has proved controversial. Undertaken in hopes of providing stability, the change had barely been announced when a military coup overthrew President Jamil Mahuad. Dollarization protests by Indian and labor groups continue, but there has been no reported hostility toward American visitors.</p>
        <p>One consistent complaint of dollarization opponents, somewhat odd coming from people who are used to calculating prices in multiples of 10,000, is that the new system is too complicated and hard to use. There has also been a spurt of inflation, as stores and businesses round prices up to the nearest dollar, but that is expected to abate soon.</p>
        <p>''In the past, because we did not have a strong currency, we were always having to change prices and our interest rates were very high, which discouraged investors,'' said Rocio Vazquez, Minister of Tourism and Environment. ''Our prices have always been competitive, but now we think we can also compete with the quality of our product,'' he said, and attract, for example, more international hotel chains.</p>
        <p>It is clear, however, that Ecuador's domestic tourist industry will have to adjust. Most leading hotels were already billing customers in dollars, based on the exchange rate of the day, to protect themselves from currency fluctuations and thus are likely to be unaffected. But for tour operators, the new system will require more efficiency and foster greater competition.</p>
        <p>''In the past, the exchange rate has always been used as a cushion against any unforeseen problems or costs,'' Ms. Granizo said. ''If the exchange rate was 15,000 today, you knew it was going to be 18,000 tomorrow, so you were protected if, for instance, you had to suddenly contract an extra bus at the last moment. But that buffer has now disappeared.''</p>
        <p>Another result of dollarization is that Ecuador is likely to make a greater effort to draw American visitors to a country that is only a four-hour flight from Miami. In the past, tourism efforts have focused much more on Europe, to the extent that, according to the Ecuadorean Embassy in Washington, Ecuador does not currently even have a tourism information and promotion office in the United States. But Ecuador's tour operators are planning what they call a caravan to visit the United States later this year to promote all-inclusive and other packages aimed at the American market. Of the 508,000 tourists who visited Ecuador in 1999,  down slightly from 1998, barely one third were from the United States, and many of those came to study Spanish in low-budget exchange programs.</p>
        <p>''Due to the atmosphere of social agitation our country experienced, our image abroad was hurt,'' Ms. Vazquez said. ''But to the extent that the economy stabilizes as the dollarization plan is implemented, we expect that the flows of visitors and of capital will resume.''</p>
