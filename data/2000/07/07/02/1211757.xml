        <p>AFTER hearing Britney Spears' current hit, ''Oops!  . . . I Did it Again,'' 8-year-old Will Jones of High Bridge, had a revelation. The second-grader told his mother, ''I know why she calls the song 'Oops! . . . I Did it Again,' he said ''It's because the song sounds just like her last record.''</p>
        <p>It is difficult to argue with such insight, but the familiarity of Ms. Spears' music, and the fact that it trickles down to 8-year-olds is part of the formula that is making Britney Spears a musical superstar.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spears, at 18, is very much the teenager. Her speech is peppered with ''cool,'' ''like'' and ''really, really.'' She reverts easily to a subtle Southern drawl, and she exudes the kind of youthful fun apparent in her music.</p>
        <p>As for Will Jones's comment, she doesn't mind. ''I think it's cool that I have my sound, and no one can touch that,' she said. ''I'm marking my territory.''</p>
        <p>The public's current love affair with teenage singers (it happens every generation), began in country music in 1996, with the powerful voice of 13-year-old LeeAnn Rimes and her Patsy Cline sound-alike hit ''Blue.'' Before we knew it, we had Ms. Spears, Backstreet Boys, Christina Aguilera and many more waiting in the wings. The face of pop music had changed.</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Spears burst onto the scene in 1998 with the infectious hit single, ''Baby, One More Time,'' she was, however, groomed for fame from her early childhood. Born in rural Kentwood, La., she spent her youth performing in talent shows and dance reviews. She studied in New York during her summers at the Off-Broadway Dance Center and the Professional Performing Arts School and had begun acting in television commercials. At 10, she landed a role in the Off-Broadway production ''Ruthless,'' based on the movie ''The Bad Seed,'' an evil role that some mean-spirited critics say she is still playing.</p>
        <p>A year later, at 11, she donned a pair of big ears and joined the new ''Mickey Mouse Club Show'' for two years. It was then when she decided she wanted a music career. She was soon signed by Jive Records, home of the Backstreet Boys, and she joined producers Eric Foster (Whitney Houston) and Max Martin (Backstreet Boys) to create a debut album that would shatter all records.</p>
        <p>''I worked hard to get here,'' she said. ''That this is an overnight success is the biggest misconception.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Spears began touring malls with 'NSYNC, and when her debut album was released, she became, at 17, the youngest musical artist to have a No. 1 debut album and single. It has since sold 12 million copies, while her new album, ''Oops! . . . I Did It Again,'' is at 3 million in sales in just five weeks.</p>
        <p>The midriff-baring Ms. Spears has been dogged by controversy ever since her libidinous ''Baby, One More Time'' video and her racy 1999 cover photo in Rolling Stone. She has been accused of everything from receiving breast implants to lip-synching her songs in concert. She was  taken to task for wearing suggestive clothing, and being a bit too sexy for her pre-teenaged audience.</p>
        <p>''I can't worry what everybody thinks,'' she said. ''I think you're the sexiest when you're trying to be yourself. And I try to be myself.''</p>
        <p>In the 2000 Grammy Awards, Ms. Spears lost to her rival, the much less known Ms. Aguilera -- the more pretentious but better singer of the two.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Spears persevered, triumphing with sold-out shows, massive record sales and an endearing recent stint as host on ''Saturday Night Live,'' in which she scored points with a funny, self-deprecating monologue.</p>
        <p>''It was my idea,'' she said, ''I was ready to make fun of myself and have fun.''</p>
        <p>But for some, there is a lot to make fun of. For example, Ms. Spears's idea of singing is dancing. And singing isn't really what's on display at a Britney Spears concert. There is a lot of flash-pyrotechnics, dancing, video displays, a half-dozen costume changes, and rigging effects that makes one forget they are at a musical concert.</p>
        <p>Despite all her young fans, her show is not just for kids. The parents who accompany their youngsters have the pleasure of hearing the diva (whose vocal ability is a bit limited) revamp some of their own favorite songs like ''Satisfaction'' and ''The Beat Goes On.'' It's one of those things that sounds worse than it actually is, thanks to irresistible rhythmic production and urgent beats.</p>
        <p>Aside from daring outfits and some suggestive dancing (Ms. Spears, wearing a pink cowboy hat, does a little number swinging around a pole), the show is tame compared with what else is out there vying for young people's musical attention.</p>
        <p>Costumes are, of course, essential to the concert, and Ms. Spears' wardrobe includes her notorious Catholic schoolgirl uniform from ''Baby, One More Time'' video fame, which she removes for something more revealing.</p>
        <p>The songs, for the most part, are weak, and aside from their obvious teeny-bopper hooks, serve as mere background for flamboyant set designs, wardrobe and eight dancers. Plus, it is the audience's guess whether the near-perfect sounding vocals are pre-recorded or enhanced.</p>
        <p>''I'm never lip synching,'' Ms. Spears insists.</p>
        <p>All that said, who cares? Any criticism a grown up with sophisticated tastes might have are lost on Ms. Spears's young audience. They don't care if she has the range of Barbra Streisand or the dancing ability of Gwen Verdon; she gives them what they want. A sweet, Southern girl, who might be a bit naughty, who dances the robotic way dancing is done nowadays and who sings songs that, when they work, are perfect pop songs that stick in your head until the next big thing comes along.</p>
        <p>For a first-time concert experience for the children, it is certainly a winner. For the accompanying adult, just be aware that you'll be humming her songs for the next few weeks. All in all, no harm done.</p>
