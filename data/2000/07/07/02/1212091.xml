        <p>Jem (and Sam)  By Ferdinand Mount. Carroll &amp; Graf, $13.95.</p>
        <p>This novel of Restoration London is about a drinking buddy of Samuel Pepys (and possibly the author's ancestor) who struggles mightily to overcome his envy of Pepys's career, connections and wife. The result is ''a brilliant pastiche of 17th-century prose'' in which ''the historical detail feels rich and accurate,'' Michael Upchurch wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II  By John W. Dower. Norton/New Press, $15.95.</p>
        <p>A historian assesses the impact of the Allied occupation of Japan between 1945 and 1952 on modern Japanese history. His nuanced account, which won a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award, dissects the pretensions and practices of the operation, as well as the ambiguities, bad policy making and bureaucratic bungling of the period. He finds much to praise and to deplore in the occupation's legacy. Last year in the Book Review, J. A. A. Stockwin called this ''a magisterial and beautifully written book'' that includes ''many amazing documentary photographs.''</p>
        <p>The Woman Who Cut Off Her Leg at the Maidstone Club: And Other Stories  By Julia Slavin. John Macrae/Picador USA, $12.</p>
        <p>These tales of suburbia and the fears and self-destructive impulses underlying family commitments are infused with the grotesque: one woman grows teeth all over her body, while another swallows the yard worker she lusts after. ''Slavin's uncluttered, room-temperature prose renders the monstrous familiar, even beautiful,'' Charles Taylor wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>The Hungry Ocean: A Swordboat Captain's Journey  By Linda Greenlaw. Hyperion, $14.</p>
        <p>A female fisherman (not a fisherwoman, she insists) describes her grueling seafaring life and her many voyages off the Atlantic coast. ''It is a story of triumph, of a woman not only making it but succeeding at the highest level in one of the most male-dominated and most dangerous professions,'' Douglas Whynott said here last year. Lone Voyager: The Extraordinary Adventures of Howard Blackburn, Hero Fisherman of Gloucester, by Joseph E. Garland (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $13), tells of a sailor who survived for five days alone in an open dory during a winter storm off Newfoundland in 1883 by allowing his hands to freeze to the oars as he pulled for land. This account of his ordeal (he lost all his fingers) and his subsequent exploits is told with ''scrupulous detail and much narrative skill,'' Henry Beetle Hough wrote in these pages in 1963.</p>
        <p>The Undiscovered Chekhov: Forty-three New Stories  By Anton Chekhov. Translated by Peter Constantine. Seven Stories, $16.95.</p>
        <p>By the time he was 26, Chekhov had published more than 400 stories and vignettes in popular Russian magazines. This collection of early tales, which has been reissued with five new stories, is a ''delightful compilation,'' Donald Fanger wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>Midnight Champagne  By A. Manette Ansay. Harper Perennial, $13.</p>
        <p>This novel explores the thwarted romantic lives of guests at the Wisconsin wedding of a young couple who have known each other only briefly. The author ''weaves in and out of the sundry dramas with grace, warmth and a good deal of humor,'' Laura Jamison said here in 1999.</p>
        <p>The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of:  How Science Fiction Conquered the World  By Thomas M. Disch.  Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $13.</p>
        <p>A well-regarded science fiction novelist argues for the genre's literary merits while blaming it for encouraging delusory popular fantasies and wacko religious cults. ''Disch is an eloquent storyteller and polemicist'' and his book ''is consistently rewarding,'' Alexander Star wrote here in 1998.</p>
        <p>The Moral Life of Children  By Robert Coles. Atlantic Monthly, $13.50.</p>
        <p>Traveling to the world's trouble spots, a child psychiatrist interviews a wide variety of children to examine the way they develop their moral awareness. In a companion volume, The Political Life of Children ($13.50), also reissued by Atlantic Monthly, he studies the way youngsters think about politics. ''There is no one who is more interested in what children say, sing, don't say or don't sing -- and why -than Robert Coles,'' Neil Postman said in these pages in 1986. ''He is to the stories that children have to tell what Homer was to the tale of the Trojan War.''</p>
        <p>White Widow  By Jim Lehrer. PublicAffairs, $12.</p>
        <p>Set in the 1950's, this novel revolves around a happily married bus driver in small-town Texas whose life unravels when he becomes obsessed with a mysterious woman passenger. The result is ''an oddly affecting morality tale,'' the Book Review said in 1997.</p>
        <p>Buxton Spice  By Oonya Kempadoo. Plume, $11.95.</p>
        <p>This tale of village life in Guyana, narrated by a young girl in a rich creole, is set in the 1970's during a period of racial turmoil. '' 'Buxton Spice' is a superb, and superbly written, novel of childhood and childhood's end,'' Patrick Markee wrote here last year.</p>
