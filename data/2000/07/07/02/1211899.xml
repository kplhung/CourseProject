        <p>IT is possible to have a beautiful lawn without the use of pesticides. But the burden is on the gardener. A lush, strong turf, without the chemicals, will thrive and have few troubles, but its success will depend on how well some practices are followed. Here are some basics to keep in mind.</p>
        <p>Grasses</p>
        <p>The most popular lawn is Kentucky bluegrass, which is noted for its velvet texture and ruggedness. Several cultivars have been bred and if a solid bluegrass lawn is insisted upon, then a blend of several of these cultivars is best.</p>
        <p>But for practical purposes it is often wiser to grow a mixture of grasses that includes perennial ryegrass and fine fescues. Of course, this kind of information is best put to use when a new lawn is seeded, in September. But if the lawn is already green and growing, then all the good maintenance methods should be followed.</p>
        <p>Soil</p>
        <p>What is underneath supporting all those grass roots is important. Just because it cannot be seen, it doesn't mean it should be ignored. Although the advice to have your soil tested is heard many times, there is good reason. Nutrients in the soil and fertilizers are most readily available (soluble) to grass roots when the pH reading between 6 and 7. A pH reading below 6 indicates that the soil is acid and the more acid it is, the more the lawn nutrients are unavailable. An appearance of moss in the lawn is a good indicator of an acid-type soil.</p>
        <p>As for vital grass nutrients, iron especially is tied up at low soil pH.</p>
        <p>The solution for low pH (acid soil) is an application of lime, but this quantity must be calculated carefully by professionals, usually after a soil-test report is returned. Most state colleges test soil through their cooperative extension offices.</p>
        <p>Fertilizer</p>
        <p>Lawn feeding is one area where overdosing is common. The commercial hype for sales is overwhelming sometimes. If applied fertilizer is not absorbed by the grass roots, it ends up in the aquifers and water-supply system, encouraging the growth of algae and cutting off the supply of oxygen in the water. Since grass roots keep functioning into the early winter months, fall applications of fertilizer will be readily absorbed to stir development of a strong root system.</p>
        <p>Norman W. Hummel Jr., one of the turf and grass experts at Cornell University, recommends lawn feeding two or three times annually. For a two-time feed it should be done in the spring and again in early fall. For a three-time feed, applications are made in late spring, early fall and late fall.</p>
        <p>Mowing</p>
        <p>This is an important facet of lawn maintenance. Set the mower to cut high, about three inches and no lower than two inches. ''There is a direct relationship between mowing height and the size of the root system,'' Mr. Hummel said. ''The shorter the mowing height, the shallower the root system will be, making the lawn more susceptible to drought injury.''</p>
        <p>The motto for mowing is follow the one-third rule. That is, if the lawn is three inches high, then mow so that the grass becomes two inches high. (Be sure the mower blade is sharp enough to cut, not tear, the grass blades.)</p>
        <p>Here is another bit of advice: Environmental Defense, a national advocacy group, notes that ''Mowing the lawn with a gas mower produces as much pollution in half an hour as driving a car 172 miles.'' This fact may help to explain the recent surge in the sales of the good old-fashioned push mowers or the battery-powered mowers.</p>
        <p>Watering</p>
        <p>Summer is on the way with its heat, humidity and drought. The grass reacts by going dormant. But too many homeowners forget this and dash out with the sprinklers, or worse, install underground sprinklers to keep their lawns green. Shallow watering in the summer weakens the grass and usurps valuable ground water. It is discouraging to see timed underground sprinklers going strong during a summer shower.</p>
        <p>The key then to lawn care without pesticides is to maintain a strong, deep-rooted turf. If troubles do occur, then the rules of Integrated Pest Management should follow. Joseph Heller, an educator at the Westchester Education Center of Cornell Cooperative Extension, described it as ''scouting and monitoring'' in a search for clues about the problem.</p>
        <p>The sight of one bug should never mean a dash for the spray can. Find out what is really going on, then apply a practical solution.</p>
