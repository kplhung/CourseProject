        <p>After a year hidden away at the New York Public Library, Paul Berman, a journalist and cultural critic, was finally ready to meet his public, with an impressionistic lecture that touched on religion, sex and Spanish imperialism.</p>
        <p>The hourlong talk by Mr. Berman, one of the first 15 fellows at the library's new Center for Scholars and Writers, focused on two Latin American poets, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz and Ruben Dario. He recited long quotations of poetry in Spanish, sometimes passionately, then offered his own English translations. He did not use notes. It was almost like performance art.</p>
        <p>When it was over, no one in the small audience asked any questions. At earlier lectures by library fellows -- one about the letters of Arturo Toscanini, the Italian conductor, another about the children's books of William Godwin, an anarchist political philosopher -- there had been excited chatter and raised hands.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berman, 50, the author of ''A Tale of Two Utopias: The Political Journey of the Generation of 1968,'' could not explain the reaction, just his lecture. ''It was presented as a work of art,'' he said. ''It was presented as an adventure in poetry. It was not a polemic. People were puzzled. What can I say?''</p>
        <p>The awkward moment was an extreme example of the difficulties faced by the library's new center as it tries to find a public face. In a somewhat utopian effort to create an intellectual community, 15 fellows were thrown together in a renovated suite of offices on the northeastern corner of the landmark Humanities and Social Sciences Library at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>The one-year residency, one of the more generously endowed humanities fellowships in the country, comes with a stipend of $50,000 and a housing allowance for out-of-towners. The fellows included novelists, historians, journalists, university-based scholars, a doctor and a musician.</p>
        <p>The public had only a few opportunities to learn what the library fellows were up to. Aside from the series of five free lectures, including Mr. Berman's in early May, the fellows mostly kept to themselves, though early on they did ask one another: how would the center make use of its prominent address? What would be its public face?</p>
        <p>Other humanities institutes have faced these kinds of questions. ''It's a paradox,'' said Jocelyn Carlson Baltzell, former associate director of the New York Institute for the Humanities, a sort of lunch club for intellectuals in Greenwich Village, and now the associate director of the Los Angeles Institute for the Humanities.</p>
        <p>''Maybe it's mixing two irreconcilable aspects of intellectual life,'' she said. ''In medieval terms, there is a life of action and a life of contemplation, two separate lives. How could you possibly blend them? You get a hybrid.''</p>
        <p>The library fellows devoted their days to contemplating, reading and writing in glass- and oak-paneled offices equipped with computers and louvered hardwood blinds that snapped shut for privacy. They shared a telephone and met over a buffet lunch in the lecture room every day. Offerings from the library's vast collections were delivered at least twice daily on a rolling cart.</p>
        <p>The time seemed to melt away. On the last official day of the program on May 26, they swapped practical advice on how to download documents onto computer disks. They packed their books and boxes and traded e-mail addresses. One of the more important memos circulating was a list of the best pastry and coffee shops in Vienna, compiled by Christian Fleck, a sociologist from Austria. Some leftover Champagne materialized at lunch. There was a tinge of sadness.</p>
        <p>Francine Prose, a novelist who is writing a book on the lives of women known principally for having been muses to well-known artists, said the intellectual dividends of the program would become apparent from work produced by the fellows. ''For me, the great beauty of it was the ability to do my work,'' she said. ''Sure, it's nice if all that other stuff happens. But every moment I got to be in my office working is a real blessing.''</p>
        <p>D. Graham Burnett, a historian, found that having the time to read in solitude was precious indeed.</p>
        <p>''The process of scholarship is really reading,'' said Mr. Burnett, who had a futon delivered to his office because he does not read well sitting up.</p>
        <p>The center's leading donors, Dorothy Cullman and her husband, Lewis B. Cullman, insisted that writers be included to spice things up. They gave $10 million.</p>
        <p>Twelve fellows were named by an anonymous selection committee after a rigorous application process. Three were chosen by the center's director, Peter Gay, a Yale historian. The applicants had to demonstrate that their work would benefit directly from access to the library's collections.</p>
        <p>In announcing the first class of fellows last year, the library's president, Paul LeClerc, said he had envisioned the center ''becoming a great intellectual spark plug in the life of New York.''</p>
        <p>In a recent interview, Mr. LeClerc said he would not abandon the spark plug metaphor. ''A certain amount of sparks happened this year, and we'll see more in the future,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That sentiment was shared by Mr. Gay, 77, the author of more than 20 books on subjects including the Enlightenment, Sigmund Freud and bourgeois culture. ''We'd like New York to notice that we're here, but they will,'' he said. ''I'm very optimistic about that.''</p>
        <p>Some similar programs are more ambitious in their public outreach, like the National Humanities Center in Research Triangle Park, N.C., which holds monthly lectures, concerts and exhibitions and an occasional large public conference. But the library fellowship's low profile is not a surprise to some in the intellectual world. Stanley N. Katz, president emeritus of the American Council of Learned Societies, said Mr. LeClerc and Mr. Gay were ''traditional and cautious.''</p>
        <p>Even so, a fellowship program faces a delicate balancing act when it tries to engage the public, Mr. Katz said, because prospective fellows ''will only come to this sort of thing if they will have time primarily to themselves.''</p>
        <p>And Mrs. Baltzell, of the Los Angeles Institute for the Humanities, said she believed that such centers were elitist by their nature. ''The idea of evangelical intellectuals is an oxymoron,'' she said. ''To go out with a missionary purpose is antithetical to the contemplative life.''</p>
        <p>One of the library's 15 fellows, Andrew Delbanco, a Columbia professor, said he expected the center's relationship with the public to evolve.  ''In its first few months, it's finding its way,'' he said. ''I would like to see the engagement of the center with the larger life of the city deepened and developed for the future.''</p>
        <p>Even in private, the library fellows found that their best intentions sometimes fell short. Earlier this year, two of them, Anthony Holden, a British journalist and biographer, and Dr. Howard Markel, a pediatrician and medical historian, started discussions of Dickens's ''Bleak House'' with three other fellows.</p>
        <p>(Mr. Holden is researching a book on Leigh Hunt, the English poet, critic and essayist, who is caricatured in the novel, and Dr. Markel has written five scholarly papers on Dickens and medicine.)</p>
        <p>Another fellow, Pamela Clemit, a specialist in British Romantic literature, had taught the novel at the University of Durham in England. But she said she was told only belatedly about the discussions. By then, the discussions had collapsed because of conflicting schedules.</p>
        <p>The fellows often exchanged ideas over lunch. At one informal lunch talk, Sven Beckert, a Harvard history professor, told the others he had decided to write a book about cotton to get at issues of global business.</p>
        <p>The hands of fellows shot up. Ada Louise Huxtable, the architectural historian and critic, offered that labor relations in the early mill villages were coercive, that workers were virtually indentured servants. Kathleen Neal Cleaver, a law professor who was the first woman on the Black Panthers' central committee and the former wife of Eldridge Cleaver, said land was available for cotton farming only because the Army had cleared it of Indians. The pediatrician made a point about cotton and disease. One novelist suggested a narrative about how a bale of cotton came to be distributed. The Latin America specialist suggested a comparison with coffee. Mr. Delbanco wondered if ''coercion'' was too broad a term to encompass both factory wage labor and slave labor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gay wondered about the role of the state, observing, ''It's more complicated than you make it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Beckert nodded politely. Later, he said: ''That was the great thing about the center. It brought people from very different perspectives together.''</p>
        <p>Generally, the departing fellows had no complaints. After all, the program had given them handsome stipends and nice offices for a year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cleaver, for one, said she felt part of a special group because it was the first, and the groups could be quite different five years from now.</p>
        <p>But she could not help noting that in its first year, the fellowship was not particularly diverse, either by gender or race. ''How could it not strike you?'' she said. ''This is New York City. It is a raucously diverse city, and that's not the way you would describe the collection of scholars.''</p>
        <p>Library Names Fellows for 2nd Year</p>
        <p>The New York Public Library has announced the names of the second class of 15 fellows appointed to its Center for Scholars and Writers for the academic year beginning this fall.</p>
        <p>The center's director, Peter Gay, chose three of the fellows: Andre Aciman, associate professor of literature and language at Bard College; Rachel Hadas, poet and professor of English at Rutgers University; and Bernhard Schlink, novelist and professor of law at Humboldt University of Berlin.</p>
        <p>The other 12 fellows were chosen by an anonymous selection committee from 204 applicants from 22 countries: Jonathan Bush, visiting professor, University of Texas School of Law; Joseph Cady, adjunct associate professor of behavioral medicine at the Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education, City University of New York Medical School; Ileen A. DeVault, associate professor of labor history, Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations; Steve C. Fraser, independent scholar; Walter Frisch, professor of music, Columbia University; Francisco Goldman, novelist; Eiko Ikegami, professor of sociology of the graduate faculty at New School University; Phillip Lopate, Adams Chair professor, department of English, Hofstra University; Anne Mendelson, independent scholar; Claudia Pierpont, independent scholar; Colm Toibin, novelist; and Serinity Young, visiting assistant professor of religious studies, Southern Methodist University.</p>
