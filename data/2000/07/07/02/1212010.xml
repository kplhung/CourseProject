        <p>Comment on North Carolina governor's race; Republican Richard Vinroot is eager to link himself with presidential candidate George W Bush; Democrat Mike Easley is less happy about link with Al Gore, since no Democrat has carried state since 1976 (Campaign Briefing) (S)</p>

        <p>Richard Vinroot, the Republican nominee in this year's governor's race in North Carolina, seldom misses an opportunity to link his candidacy to that of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Mr. Bush is running ahead of Vice President Al Gore in most Tarheel State presidential preference polls, and Mr. Vinroot, a former mayor of Charlotte, knows a coattail when he sees it.</p>
        <p>In polls, Mr. Vinroot is running behind his Democratic opponent, State Attorney General Mike Easley.</p>

        <p>Richard Vinroot, the Republican nominee in this year's governor's race in North Carolina, seldom misses an opportunity to link his candidacy to that of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Mr. Bush is running ahead of Vice President Al Gore in most Tarheel State presidential preference polls, and Mr. Vinroot, a former mayor of Charlotte, knows a coattail when he sees it.</p>
        <p>In polls, Mr. Vinroot is running behind his Democratic opponent, State Attorney General Mike Easley.</p>
        <p>''As Bush goes, so go we,'' Mr. Vinroot likes to say. And where Mr. Bush goes when he shows up in North Carolina, Mr. Vinroot tries to follow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Easley has a different take on coattails. What he knows is this: While Democrats may be dominant generally in North Carolina, only one Democratic presidential candidate has managed to carry the state in the last eight elections -- Jimmy Carter in 1976.</p>
        <p>What to do, then, when Al Gore shows up?</p>
        <p>It happened the other day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore flew in to give a morning commencement speech at Tarboro High School, a few miles from Mr. Easley's hometown, Rocky Mount. Mr. Easley did not show.</p>
        <p>That afternoon, Mr. Gore appeared in Raleigh at North Carolina State University, a jog down the road from Mr. Easley's office.</p>
        <p>Again, Mr. Easley did not show.</p>
        <p>Well, not exactly . . .</p>
        <p>He did show, but not until the speech was over and the crowd had drifted off. Then the men had a talk.</p>
        <p>Mr. Easley says he is a good Democrat. There is no serious dispute about that in his party. The thing to keep in mind, he says, is that some races ''take on a life of their own.''</p>
        <p>Thus far in his travels about the country, Mr. Gore has not run into many races like that.</p>
