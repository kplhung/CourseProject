        <p>Because of an editing error, an article on May 28 about Calpernia Addams, who is in the process of changing sexes to female from male, and the murder of her boyfriend, Pfc. Barry Winchell, included an erroneous statement about a meeting between Addams and Kathi Westcott, a lawyer, and Rhonda White, a gay rights advocate, after the murder. Westcott did not say that Addams, ''for the sake of clarity,'' should tell reporters to refer to her as a male. White and Westcott discussed the press with Addams but did not make a specific proposal about how the press should refer to her.</p>
