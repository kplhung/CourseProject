        <p>Mark Messier officially became a free agent yesterday. And there is little doubt around the National Hockey League that the 39-year-old center's next move will be to re-sign with the Rangers, three years after he left New York in a messy divorce and six years since leading the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup in 54 seasons. The Rangers have not been to the playoffs since Messier left.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was the first day free agents could officially talk to teams. Did the Rangers talk to Messier?</p>
        <p>''Of course,'' Glen Sather, the Rangers' new president and general manager, said last night. ''I had permission from Brian Burke'' -- the general manager of the Vancouver Canucks, for whom Messier played last season -- ''to talk to Mess three days ago.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if Mark will end up in New York. But I will certainly talk to him. I'm sure he would like to come back. That is the indication I got from him. And I expressed to him that I would like him to come back. But we still have to make a deal.''</p>
        <p>Sather is not expected to make many moves until after his son Shanon's wedding in Alberta on July 8, but he did not rule anything out. ''I don't think in this business that anything stops you from making a deal that could help your hockey team,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One N.H.L. official said yesterday that Sather was close to making several moves.</p>
        <p>Sather is on the verge of bringing in Ted Green from Edmonton to be an assistant to the general manager, the official said. (The Rangers have yet to name a head coach, although Ron Low, one of Sather's coaches when he was in Edmonton, is considered the favorite for the job.)</p>
        <p>Sather is also working on a deal that would bring the 24-year-old left wing Matt Johnson from Atlanta.</p>
        <p>There has been speculation that Johnson would be acquired for Stephane Quintal, a 31-year-old defenseman, and Darren Langdon, a 29-year-old left wing, but Sather said, ''Do you think I'm out of my mind?''</p>
        <p>''You seem to forget Quintal had a pretty good year the year before last,'' Sather said. ''Matt Johnson's a tough guy, for sure. But I'm not sure Langdon couldn't whip him himself.''</p>
        <p>Langdon, the Rangers' de facto enforcer the last few years and one of the most popular players in the dressing room, played just 21 games last season before undergoing season-ending abdominal surgery.</p>
        <p>Still, the acquisition of the 6-foot-5-inch, 232-pound Johnson, who has accrued 825 penalty minutes in 246 N.H.L. games, would address one of the Rangers' most glaring needs. Sather has taken over a team that has long lacked a physical presence.</p>
        <p>Johnson is one reason: it was his hit on Jeff Beukeboom on Nov. 19, 1998, when Johnson was a member of the Los Angeles Kings, that eventually led to Beukeboom's retirement because of postconcussion effects.</p>
        <p>Quintal became unpopular in the dressing room after he was quoted in a French-language newspaper in Montreal as saying he regretted signing with the Rangers before last season. The Rangers suspended him for the last four games of the season.</p>
        <p>Sather is also believed to be working on a deal that would send another unpopular Ranger, Valery Kamen sky, to Vancouver. Kamensky was one of the Rangers' biggest busts after signing a four-year, $17 million contract; he had 13 goals and 19 assists in 58 games. The Canucks, however, may be willing to take on only $500,000 annually of Kamensky's salary.</p>
        <p>The Rangers lost out yesterday on the free agents Dallas Drake, who signed with St. Louis, and Scott Thornton, who signed with San Jose.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>MATHIEU SCHNEIDER, a Rangers defenseman the past two seasons, said yesterday that two teams had expressed interest in his services but that the Rangers were not one of them. ''We're not really expecting anything until later in the week,'' said Schneider, who added that, ''all things being equal,'' he would prefer to re-sign with the Rangers. . . . IGOR LARIONOV, a 39-year-old center who was on two Stanley Cup-winning teams in five seasons in Detroit, signed a one-year contract with Florida. He chose the Panthers over the Calgary Flames and signed a one-year deal worth $1.8 million. . . . Anaheim agreed to a multiyear deal with center GERMAN TITOV, a free agent who scored 17 goals in 70 games last season with Pittsburgh and Edmonton. . . . Dallas center GUY CARBONNEAU, a three-time Selke trophy winner as the league's best defensive forward, announced his retirement yesterday. Carbonneau, who at 40 was the N.H.L.'s oldest player last season, played 19 seasons.</p>
