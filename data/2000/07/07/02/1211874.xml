        <p>''ITHINK the truth is my friend in this,'' Vice President Al Gore said as he released the transcript of a contentious sworn interview with a Justice Department official over fund-raising in the 1996 election. Ordinary folks trying to untangle the 123-page document may wonder how Mr. Gore really treats his friends.</p>
        <p>That's not to say that Mr. Gore's answers were very different from those in any questioning of a smart, well-prepared witness disinclined to help his adversary.  They were, however, very different from human conversation.</p>
        <p>What is it about legal proceedings and particularly those pretrial sworn interviews known as depositions that turn sophisticated people into quibblers, dissemblers or amnesiacs? Why can't they just respond to the questions posed as people respond in everyday conversations?</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is not alone in having questions raised about his candor under oath, questions that had House Republicans putting pressure on Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint a special counsel. The independent counsel Robert W. Ray recently concluded that the testimony of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on the dismissal of several White House travel office employees in 1993 was at least truthful enough that Mr. Ray did not think he could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she had lied.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was, in fact, tolerably forthcoming as far as depositions go. At times, he was precise, even a little funny. He knew that on the day of the interview he had been vice president for ''seven years and two months and 28 days.'' He recounted his delight on learning in the spring of 1996 that his schedule would include a luncheon at a Buddhist temple in California. ''This ought to be interesting,'' he said he remembered thinking. ''Little did I know.''</p>
        <p>But in the face of an impressive series of documents that suggested the contrary, he stoutly resisted his interlocutors' efforts to make him concede that fund-raising was going on at either White House ''coffees'' (of which he attended either one, according to Mr. Gore, or some 30, according to other reports) or the luncheon at the Buddhist temple.</p>
        <p>Part of the answer for all the parsing is that depositions are preparation tools meant to prevent surprises at trial. They are very rarely considered in their entirety or even used at trial. Lawyers sometimes use them to contradict witnesses who change their stories on the stand; occasionally the transcripts are read to the jury when witnesses are unavailable.</p>
        <p>With the advent of videotaped depositions, and their use in and out of the courtroom, a lawyer's standard advice to witnesses -- to say as little as possible -- may no longer be wise, particularly when those witnesses are public figures. The evasive responses of Microsoft's Bill Gates helped undermine his corporation's case. President Clinton, on the other hand, is thought to have helped himself with his garrulous and expansive grand jury testimony, whatever its truthfulness.</p>
        <p>A lawyer prepares a witness by stating that the enterprise embarked upon is an exercise in playing defense, and that the questioner is the enemy. The object is not to give up any ground.</p>
        <p>The witness, the lawyer continues, must become a user-unfriendly computer, producing a truthful answer but not a particularly expansive one.  The witness is not obligated to reformulate the questions or respond to what the questioner is plainly, if clumsily, driving at.</p>
        <p>The lawyer also reminds witnesses that their names on a document -- as addressees or perhaps even as authors -- are no proof that they have ever seen it, much less that what it says is true. The lawyer will note the value of stock answers like ''I don't know'' or ''I don't remember.'' It may also be suggested that perjury prosecutions are rare and that the crime is a long coast dotted with countless safe harbors. Perjury requires a statement that is known to be false when said, actually false rather than merely misleading, and material to the case.</p>
        <p>One Supreme Court case demonstrates just how hard perjury is to prove. A witness was asked, ''Do you have any bank accounts in Swiss banks?'' He said no, truthfully. ''Have you ever?'' The witness, who once had a personal account there, replied: ''The company had an account there for about six months, in Zurich.''  Because the last answer was literally true, although certainly misleading, the defendant's conviction was reversed.</p>
        <p>Ordinary conversation is a very different beast. A chat with a friend over a beer is filled with answers to the question you meant to or should have asked, with corrections of mistaken premises, with volunteered information, with little anticipations and courtesies and clarifications.</p>
        <p>Even so, everyday life is full of misunderstandings.  It is no easy task to communicate even where both sides are trying their best. Now factor in the adversary system, and the chances of learning anything the witness chooses not to convey diminish radically.</p>
        <p>None of this is to suggest that life outside of litigation is an Eden of truth-telling. Mr. Gore was questioned mercilessly about a seemingly harmless courtesy letter to a supporter after a visit to Taiwan. He was made to assess his own truthfulness, sentence by sentence. ''No, I was actually glad I was not with them on the rest of the voyage,'' he testified. And, he continued, ''the statement that the 'meetings with the government and business leaders were fascinating' appears to be an overstatement, as does the description of the visit to the Fo Kuang Shan facility as being 'almost overwhelming.' '' So too ''the statement that it was 'the most enjoyable trip I have ever taken.' '' The entire thing was a tissue of lies or, as Mr. Gore put it, ''within the customary bounds of this sort of communication.''</p>
