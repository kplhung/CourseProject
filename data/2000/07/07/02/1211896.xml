        <p>Caroline Woolsey Ferriday received the cutting from a Mr. Brooks, who, according to documents left by Ms. Ferriday, also sent cuttings from the Napoleon willow to others. ''In the spring of 53, true to his word, Mr. Brooks sent me 3 cuttings -- 2 throve and were subsequently planted in the orchard,'' Ms. Ferriday wrote in her garden notes. ''It comes from a willow whose ancestor overhung the Emperor's tomb at St. Helena and whose progeny have been carfeully preserved, ever since.''</p>

        <p>Attached to that note is another note Ms. Ferriday received informing her of the death of Mr. Brooks. The note, which is undated, mentions the willow.</p>
        <p>''Dear Miss Ferriday, Mr. Brooks would be very much pleased to know his 'willow slips' had grown so well as he had sent them to 'kin or connections' of Napoleon and his sisters, many living in Texas, Nebraska, etc.''</p>
