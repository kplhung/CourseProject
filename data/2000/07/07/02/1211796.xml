        <p>Once, push-button phones were a novelty. Now, with new wireless services, phones can push your buttons. SmartRay .com, a wireless media network, and Inshop.com, a Web site that specializes in shopping information, have teamed up to deliver free shopping alerts to subscribers.</p>
        <p>By filling out a questionnaire posted on Inshop's site, selecting favorite shopping locations, brands and products, users can customize alerts, which appear a few times a day as brief text messages on their cell phones, pagers or modem-linked PDA's. SmartRay's network offers other info-alerts, like a daily task reminder service, updates from ESPN Sports Ticker and jokes from Humor.com.</p>

        <p>Once, push-button phones were a novelty. Now, with new wireless services, phones can push your buttons. SmartRay .com, a wireless media network, and Inshop.com, a Web site that specializes in shopping information, have teamed up to deliver free shopping alerts to subscribers.</p>
        <p>By filling out a questionnaire posted on Inshop's site, selecting favorite shopping locations, brands and products, users can customize alerts, which appear a few times a day as brief text messages on their cell phones, pagers or modem-linked PDA's. SmartRay's network offers other info-alerts, like a daily task reminder service, updates from ESPN Sports Ticker and jokes from Humor.com.</p>
        <p>For people concerned that all that cell-shopping and joking could be hazardous to their health (a theory not yet proven), there is Zeropa, a tiny device shaped like a ladybug, which attaches onto or near a cell phone's antenna and is supposed to protect users from the electromagnetic radiation produced by the phone.</p>
        <p>Slightly less than an inch long, the product is made of a patented combination of ceramics designed to absorb electromagnetic waves. A study conducted by the University of Utah showed that Zeropa did reduce the amount of electromagnetic energy -- measured as heat -- absorbed by the body. The device is $29.95 on the Internet at 1-800-mobiles.com and at many cell phone stores.</p>
        <p>Why the cute shape? The design was inspired by a ladybug's knack for killing harmful insects said Lance Mallet, the president of RPM Inc., which makes the Zeropa.</p>
