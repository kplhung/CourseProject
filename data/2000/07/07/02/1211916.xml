        <p>Ask Gen. Wesley K. Clark how he felt about leaving the military in April after 34 years in uniform, and he proudly interjects, ''Thirty-eight, including West Point.''</p>
        <p>As Supreme Commander of NATO, General Clark, 55, had been in charge of allied forces in Yugoslavia. Though he is hardly the first to exchange dress blues for a business suit, he is not joining a military contractor or becoming a lobbyist.</p>
        <p>Instead, he is joining Stephens Group Inc. as what the company calls a corporate consultant. ''It will be in the merchant banking area, particularly business in the high-tech field,'' General Clark explained by telephone last week from San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he and his wife, Gert, were vacationing. He plans to be a deal maker as well as an adviser to the Stephens family and its businesses. ''Some of these are going to be private, and others will be going public,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Those businesses include emerging technology concerns ranging from e-commerce to surgical biomaterials. According to General Clark and to Warren A. Stephens, the company's chairman, these fields are a perfect match with the general's experience in military technology and his engineering degree from West Point, where he finished first in the class of 1966.</p>
        <p>Based in Little Rock, Ark., where General Clark was born and raised, the Stephens Group is the family's private holding company for businesses including the Stephens Inc. investment banking firm. The general and the chief executive first crossed paths during one of General Clark's visits home.</p>

        <p>PRIVATE SECTOR  Correction:  July 9, 2000, Sunday  A picture last Sunday with a brief report in the Private Sector column about Gen. Wesley K. Clark and his new role as a corporate consultant was published in error. It showed Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, who succeeded General Clark as NATO's supreme commander, not General Clark.</p>
