        <p>George Steinbrenner usually refers to his manager and his general manager by their first names when the Yankees are playing well. Joe and Brian, the principal owner will call them.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees are slumping, they looked terrible in a loss Friday, and Steinbrenner met with his manager and general manager today, referring to them afterward by their last names, Torre and Cashman.</p>
        <p>''I have a manager and a general manager who have delivered three world championships to New York in three out of the last four years,'' Steinbrenner said; Cashman was an assistant to Bob Watson in 1996. ''I've never had a better relationship since I've been in the game, and I'm not going to be critical or go against their judgment. They both feel that this team will be in the series.''</p>
        <p>The World Series, Steinbrenner meant. ''They both feel they can win the division,'' he continued. ''It's good enough for me. If you got questions about this or that, you've got to ask Torre or Cashman.</p>
        <p>''I had lunch with them today, and they convinced me, and I'm going to be going with them this year. They told me they will get it done and get it turned around. It would do no good for me to get into it, and do this and do that like I did years ago, because I have two people who have delivered and I have to trust what they tell me.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner initially had plans to have lunch with Torre alone, but he asked Cashman to go along after the Yankees' brutal  6-4 loss to Tampa Bay on Friday, when relievers Jeff Nelson and Todd Erdos issued walks with the bases loaded to force home the Devil Rays' last two runs.</p>
        <p>''There's no denying that I can't understand the way they're playing,'' Steinbrenner said. ''The guys who are not doing their jobs, they know who they are, so it doesn't do any good to point out who they are. It's now gut-check time. As David Cone himself said, 'Put up or shut up.' That's where we are right now.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner seemed somewhat taken aback by a question about whether the Yankees dynasty of recent years was falling apart. ''Nothing is forever, but I don't think the dynasty has crumbled,'' he replied. ''I have been assured by both men not to be concerned -- they're concerned, naturally -- but not to worry, they'll turn this thing around. It depends on those guys out there on the field, they've got to do the job.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner would not comment on how close he thinks the Yankees came to paying the high cost to acquire Sammy Sosa before opting for David Justice. ''We got the guy that we wanted, let's put it that way,'' he said, ''and we didn't mortgage the house to do it.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees have been in the market for a pitcher, and their desire to augment their staff is most likely heightened by the fact that they will play seven games in six days next week, including the day-night doubleheader against the Mets on July 8. They have been talking to Pittsburgh about Francisco Cordova and Jose Silva, and with Oakland about Omar Olivares (possibly in a package with John Jaha). They would have interest in Curt Schilling if the Phillies right-hander ever became available, but any negotiations with Philadelphia would be protracted because the Yankees would contend with other bidders.</p>
        <p>A Benching or a Breakout</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre has praised the intensity of first baseman Tino Martinez for years, saying how much Martinez pushes himself. When Martinez has slumped, Torre has theorized that he beats up on himself. Martinez's average had sunk to .259 after Friday's game, and Torre said before today's 6-1 victory over Tampa Bay that he might give him a day off Sunday.</p>
        <p>''He's just fighting it right now,'' Torre said. ''If it doesn't look better today, then I'll get him a day off tomorrow, and hopefully he can have two off-days in a row and then come back on Tuesday. I'm just so reluctant. You really can't break out of a slump on the bench. A couple of hits today could ease everything for him.''</p>
        <p>Martinez drove in three runs with a double today, and had another hit as well, improving his batting average to .261. But he was clearly annoyed about questions that inferred that his slump was the result of his putting too much pressure on himself.</p>
        <p>''It's always 'pressing,' it's never my swing,'' he said. ''If I'm pressing, that's the easy way out. I'm out here every day, working on my swing.''</p>
        <p>Martinez has had a problem with his neck on which he will not elaborate; Torre indicated before the game that the neck ailment was no longer a problem. ''He may have gotten into some bad habits when he got this thing with his neck,'' Torre said. ''But I think that part of it is a lot better. I remember a few years ago when he got hit in the back by Benitez. He got into some bad habits in trying to play with that and wound up in a little bit of a slump.'' Martinez was hit by a pitch in 1998 by Baltimore's Armando Benitez, and it took months for him to regain his swing.</p>
