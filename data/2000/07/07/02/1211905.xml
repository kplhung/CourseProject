        <p>Sold out of Ricky Martin's recent concert? Don't fret, there's another Latin heartthrob in town. Marc Anthony, who will perform at the PNC Arts Center next Saturday and Sunday, has been riding the salsa wave with a voice that possesses more color and range than Mr. Martin's and a repertory that includes songs like ''Livin' La Vida Loca'' a run for their money. And like Mr. Martin, though it seems as though he is an overnight sensation, Mr. Anthony has been paying his musical dues for years. Be prepared for a lot of screaming from the audience. This is the (young) Frank Sinatra of Latin music.</p>

        <p>One of America's most influential bands, the Toasters, introduced ska to a dance-ready nation in the early 1980's, and made the way for commercial breakthroughs by more rock-oriented ska bands like the Mighty Mighty Bosstones. If you're interested in the horn-heavy sound and danceable beat, this is the band that set the rules. They will appear Friday at Asbury Fast Lane in Asbury Park.</p>
