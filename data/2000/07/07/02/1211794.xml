        <p>IN August 1998, Scott Robinson Hirsch boarded the Manhattan-bound Hamptons Jitney in East Hampton, N.Y., loaded up the seat next to him with reading material, and prayed that no one would have the nerve to bushwhack all his papers and take the spot. Of course, as jitney riders know, passengers will leap over any obstacle, like the horses at the annual Hampton Classic.</p>
        <p>At the next stop, Bridgehampton, N.Y., Melissa Mather Pearsall boarded with an armful of flowers from her garden. ''There were only a few seats to choose from,'' remembered Ms. Pearsall, who was until recently an associate at the Manhattan law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft.

        <p>IN August 1998, Scott Robinson Hirsch boarded the Manhattan-bound Hamptons Jitney in East Hampton, N.Y., loaded up the seat next to him with reading material, and prayed that no one would have the nerve to bushwhack all his papers and take the spot. Of course, as jitney riders know, passengers will leap over any obstacle, like the horses at the annual Hampton Classic.</p>
        <p>At the next stop, Bridgehampton, N.Y., Melissa Mather Pearsall boarded with an armful of flowers from her garden. ''There were only a few seats to choose from,'' remembered Ms. Pearsall, who was until recently an associate at the Manhattan law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft. ''I thought, 'I'll take the one with the cute guy.' ''</p>
        <p>She soon learned ''the cute guy'' was a Bowdoin College graduate who loves sailing, history and all things English, especially Winston Churchill. As a child, Mr. Hirsch, now 33 and on leave from his job as a portfolio manager at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Company, the Wall Street bank, even played with a miniature castle, filling it with toy antique furniture. ''Scott must have been a lord in an earlier life,'' said his mother, Holly Young Huth, a writer of children's books who lives in Gold Hill, Colo. ''He's very into tradition and the old ways and landed gentry.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Pearsall, 32, also loves tradition. She graduated from Yale University and is a descendant of the Rev. Samuel Mather, one of Yale's founders. She spends every weekend at the Bridgehampton house of her parents, Otis Pratt Pearsall, a partner in the law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter, and Nancy Boden Pearsall, a residential real estate developer.</p>
        <p>On the jitney ride, she and Mr. Hirsch talked nonstop as she busily addressed invitations to a party she was giving. ''Melissa is all about energy and enthusiasm,'' Lucy Dabinett, her college roommate, said. ''At Yale, she was the type of person who would go to an event in the evening, be the last to leave, get up at the crack of dawn to play golf, then write two papers in a few hours so she could go out and socialize again. We were all so exhausted just keeping up with her.''</p>
        <p>After two and a half hours of conversation, Mr. Hirsch got off the jitney, carrying her phone number. A few days later, they went out to lunch, and soon they were riding the jitney together almost every weekend, often eating dinners by candlelight at her family's 18th-century Bridgehampton house, with its wide plank floors, antique furniture and window panes as blurry as sea glass. ''This is a couple straight out of the 18th century,'' said the bridegroom's father, Gerry Strasser Hirsch, a management consultant in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Last year, the subject of marriage began to creep into their conversations like an ocean fog. ''We talked about marriage in the third party, as lawyers might,'' Ms. Pearsall recalled. ''We'd say, 'If you were to engage in a legal contract, how many kids might one want?' 'How might one want to spend Christmas?' ''</p>
        <p>They took their vows on June 24 in the late afternoon behind the Pearsall house, in a small crab apple orchard filled with honeysuckle-yellow light. Afterward, 270 guests gathered for cocktails on the meticulously manicured lawn, amid English gardens and trees as old and still as grandfather clocks.</p>
        <p>Many guests were discussing the couple's honeymoon -- five months' sailing on a chartered yacht around Europe and the Caribbean -- as well as the way they met. Few could believe they had found each other on the Hamptons Jitney, where one is more likely to encounter runaway lap dogs or angry passengers with boundary problems. ''I grew up going out to East Hampton, and I never met anyone on the jitney except difficult women who need their space,'' Kimberly Donaldson, a bridesmaid, said.</p>
        <p>The matron of honor, Katharine Pearsall, the bride's cousin, added, ''It's a very rare thing to sit down and meet your soul mate on the jitney.''</p>
