        <p>The New York City teachers' union has thwarted a plan by the principal of the School for the Deaf to replace 35 teachers who are not proficient in American Sign Language with those who are, officials said.</p>
        <p>Martin Florsheim, the principal, told 35 teachers on Tuesday that they would be working at new schools in the fall, said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the teachers' union.</p>
        <p>Union representatives quickly intervened, tentatively negotiating the number to about 10, said Ms. Weingarten, who added that principals did not have the authority to remove tenured teachers. Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education, said officials were investigating the incident.</p>
        <p>Dr. Florsheim's efforts are representative of a larger debate about the education of deaf students.</p>
        <p>The average deaf 18-year-old American cannot read above the fourth-grade level. Some advocates for the deaf say the problem lies in the fact that American Sign Language, called signing, bears no relationship to English in syntax, grammar or spelling. Ms. Weingarten said last week that methods of teaching deaf students other than sign language should be explored. But proponents of sign language, like Dr. Florsheim, who is deaf, say the problem is not with sign language but with the people teaching it.</p>
        <p>The Board of Education made American Sign Language the primary language of the deaf school in 1998, after vociferous complaints from some parents about the quality of teaching there. The school, also known as Junior High School 47, runs from prekindergarten to grade 12.</p>
        <p>Barbara Fass, a deaf mother of two deaf daughters, Esther, 7, and Adele Idy, 4, was one of the complaining parents. Both children attend the school. Ms. Fass said on Friday that she was disappointed that Ms. Weingarten had prevented Dr. Florsheim from replacing the teachers.</p>
        <p>''I completely disagree with Randi Weingarten's comment that there are other methods of teaching,'' Ms. Fass wrote in response to a question. ''A.S.L. is a language, and how is that possible for her to say that there are other methods? Is she fluent in A.S.L., and if not, what right does she have?''</p>
        <p>Terri Thomson, the Queens representative on the board, spearheaded the effort to make sign language the primary language at the school.</p>
        <p>She said on Friday that though she was not familiar with what had happened on Tuesday, she was aware of continuing staffing changes to ensure that students were well educated.</p>
        <p>''At each of our public agenda meetings, a group of parents would come to testify because their children were getting poor educations,'' Ms. Thomson said. ''Some were being taught through sign language interpreters who were not teachers, and the quality was poor. We heard from students who told of failing tests. Many said they felt isolated going to school, walking around with sign language interpreters. What they cried out for was a program where they could be taught in their home language -- A.S.L.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Florsheim, the first deaf principal of the school, has mostly hired teachers fluent in sign language to his staff of 87 since becoming principal in 1996. The school, which is on East 23rd Street at Second Avenue in Manhattan, has about 300 students.</p>
        <p>American Sign Language is an important touchstone to the deaf. It had been banned from schools for more than a century in an effort to make deaf students learn and behave more like hearing children. In the late 1960's, William Stokoe Jr., a linguist at Gallaudet University, a university for the hearing-impaired in Washington, pushed for it to become recognized as a language.</p>
        <p>But now, at a time when high-technology jobs are increasingly replacing vocational jobs, and when medical technology is making it possible for deaf children to gain partial hearing through cochlear implants, some parents and educators are pushing for broader forms of communication.</p>
        <p>Another method is cued speech, which can supplement sign language. It breaks words into syllables and conveys them with hand signals and lip reading, so that a deaf person can link visual signs and sounds to the language as it is written and spoken. Others include oral-auralism, which essentially is lip reading with the help of hearing aids; signing exact English, which is using a type of sign language to depict English just as it is spoken; and auditory verbal therapy, which teaches the maximum use of hearing aids without the lip reading.</p>
        <p>''I'm exasperated by this situation,'' Ms. Weingarten said of the incident at the school. ''Here's a school designed to help kids who are deaf or hard of hearing, and one of the approaches is supposed to be A.S.L. Dr. Florsheim believes that A.S.L. is the only way. It's a good method, but it is not an exclusive method. There are some kids who will benefit from others. That is not something he understands.''</p>
