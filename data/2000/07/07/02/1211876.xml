        <p>CARMEN SALINAS, a popular television talk show host, was warming up a huge crowd for the party in power before a speech by its presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida Ochoa. She did not emphasize his views or personality. ''Labastida is the man, the good one, the winner,'' she said. It was all the crowd needed to hear.</p>
        <p>In most democracies, parties nominate candidates they hope will win by persuading citizens to vote for them. But this is Mexico. And the party was the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, which has governed since its founding in 1929. In that party, things work differently.</p>
        <p>During the decades when the PRI held a virtual political monopoly, its insiders picked the candidate they knew would win and then instructed citizens to vote for him. Today, the monopoly has waned. But even so, PRI voters still expect to be told who is the likely winner. Their party is still driven by patronage, and they want to be on the right side of whoever will dole it out. And so the thing is to know who is ''el bueno,'' the good one, the winner.</p>
        <p>It is a facet of a political culture that sets the PRI apart from parties born of pluralistic democracy. And that is the all-important issue at stake today as Mexicans vote.</p>
        <p>For the first time, the PRI is going into a presidential election in which there is a real possibility that it could lose. It promises to be the most fair and open election the country has ever had. Polls show Mr. Labastida running even with a moderate conservative, Vicente Fox Quesada of the National Action Party or PAN (A leftist, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, is trailing.)</p>
        <p>All of the candidates call themselves democrats, but Mexicans are nevertheless making a fundamental decision about the kind of democracy they want. The question is, what do you have if there are free elections and an autocratic party wins?</p>
        <p>On one side of the contest is the PRI, a party accustomed to top-down control whose most consistent ideology has been its commitment to staying in power.</p>
        <p>On the other is an opposition that arose from popular movements for citizens' rights and a balance of powers between the president and Mexico's legislature. The opposition is democratic in the way that most  United States voters understand the term. The PRI is not. Yet millions of Mexicans flock to the PRI as the party that represents their interests the best.</p>
        <p>Mexicans recognize that the central dispute in the election is over ''la alternancia'' -- the idea of parties alternating power.</p>
        <p>PRI leaders argue that actual alternation isn't needed -- that it is enough for them to reform their party's values from within. They point to the first competitive primary that nominated Mr. Labastida as proof of a new PRI. ''As long as we have the option of alternating power, we have democracy,'' said Sandra Fuentes Berain, a top official in the Labastida campaign. ''Alternating power is not a requirement.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fox and Mr. Cardenas hold that their country will not become a democracy until the PRI is removed. Denise Dresser, a political analyst, puts it this way: ''Mexicans have truly never had the chance to throw the bums out. Tasting that experience would be extraordinarily empowering. It would inject a whole new fresh air into the process.''</p>
        <p>PRI leaders make no bones about the authoritarian nature and genius of their party. ''In this election, you are going to see the machinery of the PRI, like few parties in the world have,'' said Emilio Gamboa Patron, one of Mr. Labastida's top campaign managers. ''I'll bet not even the party in China has a machine like the one we have built up over the years.''</p>
        <p>The PRI, in fact, was created by Mexican strongmen determined to impose order on the chaos of the 1910 Mexican Revolution. To this day, Mr. Gamboa said, its work to forge national unity and spread services like clinics and schools and other political largesse throughout the land still cements its followers' loyalty. ''Our party kept the social peace,'' Mr. Gamboa said.</p>
        <p>M ANY PRI supporters who turned out to cheer Mr. Labastida knew little about him, other than that he was their man. But his rallies turned into dense crushes as followers pressed to shake his hand or, with luck, have a picture taken with him that they could display in transactions with the government.</p>
        <p>While the opposition scorns busing people to rallies and giving them free lunches, PRI voters would not have it any other way. Mr. Labastida campaigned with massive hand-outs to voters and networks that pressured government employees to vote for the PRI.</p>
        <p>Wary of change, PRI followers have been forgiving of its corruption scandals and long-term economic policies that have failed to lift the poor. ''I'd rather have an old devil I know than a new devil I don't,'' said Cristina Luna Flores, 42, a rural homemaker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox's party, the PAN, has deeply conservative Catholic and business-oriented roots. But its rightist ideas were tempered as it evolved into a a resistance movement against the PRI, battling to defend electoral victories against PRI fraud.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox, to be sure, evokes another anti-democratic figure in Mexican politics, the caudillo or political warlord. He is a strong-willed, hard-driving candidate who overwhelmed and sometimes even ignored his party. But he forced the PAN to modernize its platform and endowed it with a new organization for getting votes. In doing so, he mobilized millions who are not PAN militants but want something new.</p>
        <p>They range from young people to the wealthy elite and even the military. ''We need change,'' said Fernando Antonio Reyes, 49, an active duty army lieutenant who was in a Fox crowd. ''The PRI has taken away all our buying power. We can't take its corruption anymore.''</p>
        <p>Whoever wins, the closeness of the race means Mexico will face new conflicts. If Mr. Labastida wins, it will probably be with less than 50 percent of the vote, the first time a PRI president will not have a majority mandate.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Fox wins, his battles to govern with a legislature controlled by his adversaries may sorely test the assumption that change at the top is the soul of democracy.</p>
        <p>Either way Mexico will remain a strange hybrid - an electorate in pursuit of democracy with an authoritarian force at its very core.</p>
