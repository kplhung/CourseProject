        <p>THE annual migration to New York of new college graduates, degrees in hand, entry-level jobs on the horizon, seems as inevitable as the changing of the seasons. Just as predictable is the sticker shock they face when they plunge into the hunt for an apartment, when they realize that what they might pay for an entire house in Birmingham or Boise is barely enough for a studio here.</p>
        <p>That of course has been true, to one degree or another, for years, but the price tags presented to the class of 2000 seem particularly breathtaking, even compared to those of last year when the market was already torrid.</p>
        <p>''The cycle of soaring rents has to break somewhere, but we've been saying that for years and years and it only gets more incredible and more shocking every year,'' said Michael Shapot, an associate broker with Coldwell Banker/Hunt Kennedy in Manhattan who has many young people among his clients. ''It is a landlords' market. They are demanding, demanding, demanding -- and getting, getting, getting.''</p>
        <p>Supply and demand, with a New York twist, are part of the reason.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the booming economy in general and the demand for co-op apartments in particular, ''co-op owners who once rented their apartments are now selling them because they are getting top dollar and are choosing not to rent any longer,'' Mr. Shapot said. ''There are some new buildings, but they are selling out or renting out incredibly quickly at prices that the class of 2000 is unwilling or unable to pay.''</p>
        <p>So unless the graduates have trust funds or six-figure salaries, they are finding themselves scaling down the visions they brought to the city: trading in elevators for walkups, banding together with more roommates than they had planned on, putting up temporary walls to carve bedrooms out of living rooms or relinquishing the idea of Manhattan altogether and finding haven in Brooklyn, Queens, the suburbs.</p>
        <p>Even then, they are making further compromises, like giving up a quick walk to a subway stop. Some, defeated altogether by the size of their paychecks relative to the going rents, return to the nest and parents.</p>
        <p>''This is a wealthy city, and it is starting to shape up that only kids with silver spoons can be here,'' said Andrew Heiberger, president and owner of Citi Habitats, a residential brokerage company that rented 5,400 apartments in Manhattan last year and  caters to what he described as ''upwardly mobile professionals.''</p>
        <p>But even a silver spoon, inherited or earned, may not be sufficient. Consider the case of Chip Krotee of Minneapolis, who is about to begin a job as a trader with Merrill Lynch, and Arjay Jensen of St. Louis, who will work for Goldman Sachs. Roommates at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, where they received their masters of business administration degrees in May, they figured they would find a place to live with relative ease. The moving allowances their companies gave them included payment of brokers' fees.</p>
        <p>''The brokers we called suggested we come to New York three or four weeks before we were ready to move and bring lots of cash,'' Mr. Krotee said the other day from his home in Minneapolis, where he was packing. ''We came up on May 24 figuring we'd be safe if we brought two months' rent. We were hoping to find a two-bedroom apartment somewhere on the West Side below 90th Street for $3,500 a month for the two of us.''</p>
        <p>They were shown six or seven apartments, two of which they deemed ''tenable.''</p>
        <p>''We were willing to take them outright, but we were rejected,'' Mr. Krotee said. ''We were told we needed assets of $1 million, and even with those assets landlords wouldn't look at us unless we had worked in New York City for two years. We also needed a guarantor in the tristate region with income 100 times our rent.''</p>
        <p>THEY did find a two-bedroom apartment in a prewar building on West 73rd Street. ''There the management was fine,'' Mr. Krotee said, ''but because we had no New York City guarantor, we had to put six months' rent, or $24,000, in a security deposit and had to take out loans.''</p>
        <p>''The fact that we have M.B.A.'s, six-figure salaries, perfect credit ratings and fixed assets that are not too shabby didn't matter,'' he said, looking back on the painful search.</p>
        <p>Steven Blase Boyd of Kearny, N.J., felt much the same way after he began looking for an apartment to share with three friends from Georgetown University: Benjamin Meyer of Kansas City, Kan., Nathan Swem of Shellbourne Falls, Mass., and Nicolina Kuh of Arlington, Tex. They all graduated last month and have jobs at investment banking firms like ING Barings and Warburg Dillon Read.</p>
        <p>''We found a place on East 57th Street that was a steal at $4,900, a 35th-floor penthouse with three bedrooms and two terraces, and our four salaries covered the rent,'' Mr. Boyd said. ''But they only wanted two people signing the lease and there were no two of us whose salaries covered 40 times the rent.'' (The annual income -- including salary, dividends and interest -- that landlords  require of tenants can vary, Mr. Heiberger said; 40 to 52 times the monthly rent is usual.)</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Boyd said, they were limited to one guarantor, and they had no one individual who could fill that role.</p>
        <p>At one point, Mr. Boyd grew so frustrated by endless red tape that, he said, ''even though I love the three people I'll be living with, friends since freshman year, I seriously contemplated dropping out and going to Hoboken or Jersey City by myself.''</p>
        <p>Pondering what it takes to make landlords become almost as picky as co-op boards, he said: ''We have gone to a better school where we've all graduated with honors. I was only cum laude, the other three were magnas. We are financially responsible. I paid for a year of Georgetown out of my own pocket and we all have well-paying jobs.'' Now they have signed a lease on a sublet on West 106th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue for $4,100 a month. No guarantor was required, but they are awaiting approval from the board of the co-op building. ''If they turn us down, I don't know who they want in that apartment,'' Mr. Boyd said.</p>
        <p>The rents being paid by Mr. Krotee, Mr. Boyd and their roommates do not seem out of line with current prices in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''Based on the income requirement of nine out of 10 buildings, a salary of 50 times one months' rent, someone earning $60,000 would barely qualify for a $1,200 studio,'' Mr. Heiberger said. ''And a $1,200 studio is the bottom of the barrel in the city. It would be a fifth-floor walkup or on the first floor facing an alley with a view of the trash.''</p>
        <p>''The minimum for most studios is $1,500 and they go up to $2,200,'' he continued. ''One-bedrooms that you can convert to two are $2,400, and two-bedrooms that you convert to three are around $3,600. Once you get into three bedrooms, the prices jump greatly to $6,000 and you're competing with couples with families who are raising kids in the city.''</p>
        <p>In addition, landlords, who tend to prefer older and presumably more settled tenants, are raising the bar higher in other ways. For example, the requirements for guarantors, without whom many landlords will not consider a renter right out of school, are tightening up.</p>
        <p>''Guarantors are required to make 75 times the monthly rent,'' Mr. Heiberger said. ''They must submit their own financial information that is more onerous than a mortgage application to prove that they are able to support their own obligations plus the obligations of the tenant. Six out of 10 landlords require the guarantor to be from New York State, eight of 10 that they be from the tristate area and 10 out of 10 that they be from the United States. Kids and their parents are being forced to pay more than their tuition for their senior year of college in advance just to get the key.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the fact that their nest may be empty no longer automatically ends parental financial obligation. Ryu Suzuki, who will start as an associate for UBS Warburg on Wednesday, came to New York in May right after graduating from Oberlin College. He would not have been able to move into the apartment he found -- a $2,000-a-month condo studio in Murray Hill -- had his parents, who flew here from Tokyo to make sure that he found a safe place, not been willing to put up a year's rent, $24,000, in advance. ''Having recently purchased a new house in Tokyo, they were not shocked about the prices,'' Mr. Suzuki said.</p>
        <p>Even a medical degree does not ensure safe passage through the roiling rental waters. ''It seems to me that if someone is starting out as a physician in New York and has the credentials, landlords would bend a little,'' said John Lemery of Saratoga, N.Y., whose son, Dr. John M. Lemery, just graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and started work last week as an intern in emergency medicine at the Bellevue Hospital Center.</p>
        <p>''He needed something reasonably close to Bellevue because he will work 12-hour shifts and undergo all that goes with being an intern,'' Mr. Lemery said. Dr. Lemery found a 300-square-foot studio in a doorman building on East 47th Street for $1,675 a month.</p>
        <p>''We had to pay the first and last month's rent on a two-year lease, security deposit and brokerage fees which came to more than $8,300,'' Mr. Lemery said. ''It all had to be deposited in certified funds with the broker. They wouldn't take a personal check, and I had to guarantee the lease, provide them with a copy of selected information on my income tax return and get a letter from my bank saying that we are creditworthy.''</p>
        <p>Besides providing advance payments, bank records, tax forms, references and guarantors, apartment seekers must be prepared to make snap decisions or almost inevitably forfeit opportunities even in less desirable apartments.</p>
        <p>JACOB BERCOVICI, a new graduate of the New School for Social Research in Manhattan, is moving to Williamsburg in Brooklyn because the apartment he occupied for two years in Park Slope has been sold.</p>
        <p>''I was told there was a new building in Williamsburg, and when I called, a woman told me there were eight apartments left,'' he said. ''When I went to see it, there were only two left. So many apartments had been pulled out from under my feet that I was ready to take it on the spot. It was close enough to what I was looking for and I didn't feel like going crazy. There was a guy in line behind me, and once I said I would take it, the broker turned to him and said, 'Now there is only one left,' so he took it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bercovici, a painter who is looking for a teaching job, was scheduled to move in with a roommate yesterday, and together they will pay $1,775 a month for a 1,400-square-foot loft. ''Everything else in the neighborhood was at least $500 more,'' he said. ''There is no gas in the building yet, which is why it is so cheap.'' The building is being converted from commercial to residential status.</p>
        <p>''Sadly, $2,000 a month is a steal,'' said Annie Livingston of Portland, Ore., who  graduated from Yale last year, is now the assistant public relations director at Swann Galleries in Manhattan and has been renting a room in a friend's co-op.</p>
        <p>She and her Yale roommate, Sarah Karnasiewicz of Southbury, Conn., an operations design assistant at the Whitney Museum of American Art, spent their lunch hours and evenings since the beginning of May pursuing an apartment, and said they had probably tramped through 30 of them.</p>
        <p>They made every effort to avoid using the services of a broker, Ms. Livingston said, because brokers ''charge 15 percent of the year's rent and don't do much,'' but in the end, they found their new home last Tuesday through an agent, Adam Feingold of New York City Apartments.</p>
        <p>They said it was love at first sight when they saw the apartment -- which has two bedrooms, two baths, a living room and an eat-in kitchen -- in a newly renovated four-story town house on 78th Street east of Second Avenue. Especially because the rent is $2,200 a month.</p>
        <p>The search was an education for the  women, who just last weekend were told by a broker that it was unlikely they would find a decent two-bedroom apartment for less than $4,000 a month.</p>
        <p>''When we started out, I thought that paying $1,000 a month was ridiculous,'' said Ms. Karnasiewicz, who has been camping out with friends, ''moving from floor to floor depending on the kindness of strangers'' since the start of the search. ''Now I think we are getting a great deal for the money. To get anything halfway decent or clean for less than $2,500 seems like a bargain.''</p>
        <p>''I didn't think I would be in a palace, but I expected to find something small, clean and comfortable and would go where the prices took me, anywhere where I would feel safe,'' she said. ''Then when we started looking, I realized we are definitely not in a position of power. No matter what state an apartment is in, it will be rented, probably to people making twice as much money as we are.''</p>
        <p>They got their apartment by getting to it first -- after they had begun to consider leaving Manhattan. ''We had been looking for weeks,'' she said. ''On Tuesdays at 1 p.m., when the new Village Voice listings come online, the day before the paper is printed, I go through them and make calls. I was the first person to call -- 20 minutes after the listing was posted -- and we raced over there right from work. We knew within minutes that this was it.'' Ms. Karnasiewicz's father is the guarantor.</p>
        <p>In the past, the draw of communities outside Manhattan was directly proportional to their proximity to subway or PATH stations, but even that is changing with rising demand. ''People are not so insistent any more on being right at the No. 7 subway stop,'' said Scott Cooper, a broker with Cooper Real Estate in Woodside, Queens. ''Since apartments here are in such great demand, people who used to want to be no farther than four blocks from a subway now consider 10 blocks.''</p>
        <p>Asked what locales were the most popular alternatives to Manhattan, Mr. Heiberger listed Hoboken, Jersey City and Fort Lee in New Jersey, Astoria in Queens, Long Beach on Long Island, and Williamsburg, Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights.</p>
        <p>But what is considered reasonable one year can become pricey the next. As rents rise in Park Slope, which once got the spillover from Brooklyn Heights, Windsor Terrace is becoming more popular. Rents there are 10 to 15 percent lower than in Park Slope, said John P. Burke Jr., a broker with John P. Burke Realty. A two-bedroom apartment in Windsor Terrace would be $1,650, compared to $2,200 in Park Slope, he said. ''There has been more demand for two-bedrooms this year over last,'' he said, ''mainly because few people can afford to live alone and must share to get by.''</p>
        <p>Rents in Astoria have been escalating as well. A one-bedroom apartment there that would have averaged $750 to $800 a month a year or so ago is now $900 to $1,000, Mr. Cooper said.</p>
        <p>WHICH communities are considered likely to be the next magnets for the young? The graduates are not as willing as suburban homeowners to travel more than a half hour to reach the city, brokers say, but migration east in Queens to Bayside seems to be starting, and boundaries are beginning to stretch to Staten Island and Great Neck on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Great Neck, that affluent North Shore community? ''Yes,'' Mr. Heiberger said. ''you can still get a one-bedroom apartment there for $1,200.''</p>
        <p>Tufts University class of '99 graduates Sarah Rosen, an assistant producer at Dateline NBC, and Chelsea Switzer, an events coordinator at Chelsea Piers, barely considered Manhattan, even though that was where they wanted to live.</p>
        <p>''We knew it would be impossible,'' Ms. Rosen said. ''We wanted to find something for $1,500 a month and with one bedroom that we could subdivide. We each wanted our own room and were not willing to have someone living in the living room.''</p>
        <p>They registered with an apartment listing service that provided them with addresses of places in their price range. ''Nothing they sent us to was in Manhattan,'' Ms. Rosen said. They also responded to newspaper ads, through which they found a two-bedroom third-floor walkup in Park Slope that was $450 above their budget. ''We saw it and said, 'We will kick ourselves if we don't take this,' and then the rent went up another $50 a month because we had them build a wall,'' she said. ''We immediately decided we needed a third roommate.''</p>
        <p>Through an ad they put on the Tufts alumni Web page, they recruited Stefan Kimball, a new graduate of Penn State, who has a job as a paralegal with Latham &amp; Watkins and who was scheduled to move in yesterday. The fact that the apartment is not in Manhattan doesn't seem to matter to Mr. Kimball, whose family lives in Finland. ''I like the idea of living in New York, not New Jersey,'' he said. ''Park Slope is pretty cool, and we have a nice view of Manhattan from the window. I'm paying $800, and for someplace like Park Slope, that seems like a bargain.''</p>
        <p>For those unshakable in their resolve to be in Manhattan, Gus Perry of Stein-Perry Real Estate in Washington Heights said, ''We are absolutely seeing more young people up here, and in Inwood and the north Harlem areas. This is the only place you can find a large one-bedroom for under $1,500 on the island of Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>Nichole Argyres, a book editor who graduated from the University of Michigan four years ago, and David Gordon, who graduated from its school of music in April, are moving to Inwood in August.</p>
        <p>''We had to choose whether we wanted a good location and a really small apartment or live in Brooklyn or the Bronx,'' Ms. Argyres said from Ann Arbor. ''We knew that David would be studying at the Manhattan School of Music, which is near Columbia, so we wanted to try to be in Manhattan. To live elsewhere would be a huge commute.''</p>
        <p>They found what is termed a ''junior four'' (one large bedroom and one small) for $1,300 a month. ''It's spacious in a great location 20 minutes from downtown on the express and there is lots of green,'' Ms. Argyres said happily.</p>
        <p>How much farther young people will be willing to commute to work and play in Manhattan remains to be seen. And what current trends portend for the post-college generation of the future is an open question.</p>
        <p>As Lucy Martin Gianino, an actress who is also a real estate broker with Coldwell Banker/Hunt Kennedy, put it: ''If I could give my children one gift, it would be a co-op.'' Ms. Gianino has three children, Gemina, 30, a teacher who is about to enter the  Harvard Graduate School of Education, Antonia, 27, a stage manager for the play ''Rent,'' and Gian-Murray, 22, a new graduate of Wesleyan University who will be an intern for a year with the Actors Theater of Louisville in Kentucky. ''It is my big concern as the parent of three children who are all in the arts or education,'' Ms. Gianino said. ''Will they be driven out of the city as everyone here becomes an investment banker? Will they have to leave professions they love to earn a buck so they can put a roof over their heads?''</p>
