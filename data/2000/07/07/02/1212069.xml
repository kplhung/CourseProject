        <p>''Nov. 19, 1930</p>
        <p>''Dear Mrs. Rawlings:</p>
        <p>''We are very much inclined to publish your novel, 'High Winds,' in the magazine, but would you consider certain suggestions for the revision of it, to that end, which we think might very much improve it, excellent as we think it is as it stands.''</p>
        <p>So begins ''Max and Marjorie'' (University Press of Florida, $34.95), a remarkable correspondence -- and what one might call a remarkable love story (never an affair) -- between two remarkable people. Mrs. Rawlings was Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, who was to achieve immense success within the decade as the author of ''The Yearling'' and, later, of ''Cross Creek.'' Her correspondent was Scribner's Maxwell E. Perkins -- 70 years ago, and still, the most respected and honored editor in American publishing history.</p>
        <p>They were an unlikely pair. She had been a feminist journalist and poet, something of a good old gal, who -- unhappily married -- found herself raising oranges in remote inland Florida and turning her hand to fiction. He was a mild-mannered, conservative Yankee raised on trust funds -- one grandfather was both a senator and secretary of state; the other has been called America's first art critic. Also unhappily married, and the father of five daughters (when the fourth was born he sent a one-word telegram to his mother: ''GIRL''), Perkins was not really at ease with women except when editing them. His early fame came from his having discovered F. Scott Fitzgerald and steered Ernest Hemingway through all but his first book, but he was to become most widely known as the editor who wrestled the larger-than-life Thomas Wolfe to the ground, carving from his larger-than-plausible manuscripts both ''Look Homeward, Angel'' and ''Of Time and the River.'' Throughout the 1930's and 40's his reputation grew -- for his diffidence and insistence on privacy as well as for his extraordinary string of successes. When he died, in 1947, he was working on his last discovery, James Jones's ''From Here to Eternity.''</p>
        <p>The first exchange with Mrs. Rawlings presages the tone of their professional relationship. Perkins jumps immediately to several pages of specifics: structure, characterization, motivation. ''One expects at the start that Florry at least, will more completely transcend typicality, that her individuality would make her more of a character in her own right than she is, apart from her value as a representative of the Florida Cracker.'' ''On Page 7 the first paragraph seems to us an intrusion of the writer.'' Etc., etc. And then a windup paragraph emphasizing that ''we should like to arrange to publish'' the revised manuscript. Of course, that ''we'' was he, but it was less an editorial we than a determined de-emphasizing of self. The letter reaches her at home in Cross Creek, Fla., and Rawlings replies with a courtesy and diffidence equal to his: ''It is extremely considerate of Scribner's to give me an opportunity to improve my story of the Cracker interior of Florida, 'High Winds.' I appreciate your painstaking criticism and the story can only profit by your editorial suggestions.''</p>
        <p>Two complicated people, moved by a common goal -- to produce the best possible writing -- had found each other, and apart from the minor irritations that inevitably arise between author and publisher over a long collaboration, they progressed through the next 17 years from a gratifying and productive professional relationship to a true meeting of minds. There was in Rawlings none of the ego-need so many writers are shackled with. She didn't require cosseting and worrying over like Fitzgerald, careful handling like Hem, titanic effort and emotional asbestos like Wolfe. Her talent was smaller than theirs, no doubt, but it was individual and real, and she was rock solid -- sensible, with excellent judgment, an obsessive worker never satisfied, and full of feeling. She saw life much as Perkins did -- in a way, they came to act as moral touchstones for each other. Most of all, they trusted each other. And, of course, she was a tremendous success: ''The Yearling'' -- to us a boys' book and a vehicle for Gregory Peck -- was the No. 1 best-selling novel of 1938, a Pulitzer Prize winner and admired by everyone from Fitzgerald to Margaret Mitchell to Ellen Glasgow (''It . . . tempts me to use the word 'genius.' And genius as a term in literary criticism does not often appeal to me'').</p>
        <p>The editorial relationship between Marjorie and Max goes on as it began. For her early novel ''South Moon Under,'' he again suggests cuts, structural changes, strengthening of certain characters. ''At the end of this chapter would it be out of place to have old Lantry dance with Piety, as he did with the older girl, or instead of with Sarah?'' (He knows that editing lies in the details.) She replies with characteristic modesty to his model editorial letter: ''Your diagnosis and prescription are so specific, that I think between us we can have the patient on his feet in no great while. You have a truly amazing genius for taking the product of another's imagination in the hollow of your hand. It is the height, I suppose, of critical sympathy and understanding.'' But even before her letter reaches him, he is writing again -- drawing back from seeming to impose or demand: ''Ever since I wrote you I have been worried for fear what I suggested might seem to you to be asking a great deal. . . . What I suggested was perhaps more by way of example, to show what it seemed to us was required.'' (Note the ''perhaps'' and the ''us.'')</p>
        <p>He also knows that editing lies in another, larger kind of sympathy -- the sympathy that can intuit the kind of book a given writer may have it in him or her to write. ''The Yearling'' was his idea: ''I was simply going to suggest that you do a book about a child in the scrub.'' Rawlings: ''Such a book had never occurred to me. My first reaction was one of sheer distress, and then on second thought I was quite intrigued.'' His further reflections on this project reveal him in two lights. Referring to ''Huckleberry Finn,'' ''Kim,'' ''Treasure Island'' and others, he says: ''All these books are primarily for boys. All of them are read by men, and they are the favorite books of some men. The truth is the best part of a man is a boy.'' This is his romantic and innocent side. His sharp and humorous side comes out in the same letter: ''The sales department always wants a novel. They want to turn everything into a novel. They would have turned the New Testament into one if it had come to us for publication.'' Some things never change.</p>
        <p>Other things change slowly. It would be more than four years of constant communication before Mrs. Rawlings and Mr. Perkins became Marjorie and Max. Occasionally there were flare-ups: ''Scribner proofreading is the worst of any publishing house in the country.'' ''The jacket design of course is your affair and not mine, but when 'South Moon Under' meant that the moon was invisible under the earth, it was very silly to have a large quarter-moon behind some pine trees.'' Max rises to the defense in a flap over English rights, but only to defend the owner: ''What happened was wholly my fault. . . . What I am concerned about is that you should get so totally wrong an impression of Mr. Scribner who is quixotically, almost, fair and true and considerate. You would know it if you saw him.'' (Later, Rawlings was to become so close to the entire family that she made a Scribner daughter her literary executor.) But such agitations are momentary and of no importance. By 1933, she has enough confidence in their shared approach to life to be able to write him, about a proposed public dinner in New York, ''Can you imagine anything more revolting than a large room crawling with authors?''</p>
        <p>His belief in her soundness is most clearly expressed in his eagerness to have her know his other writers. In 1936, he writes: ''I should like to have Scott Fitzgerald see you, for I think you would do him a great deal of good. He is in a very defeatist state of mind, has been for years. . . . If you are near Asheville and tell me so, and are willing to see Scott, and perhaps be somewhat depressed by it first, I'll send him.'' The meeting takes place, and she reports: ''Max, we had a perfectly delightful time. Far from being depressing, I enjoyed him thoroughly, and I'm sure he enjoyed it as much. He was as nervous as a cat, but had not been drinking. . . . I do not think you need to worry about him, physically or psychologically. He has thrown himself on the floor and shrieked himself black in the face and pounded his heels -- as lots of us do in one way or another -- but when it's over, he'll go back to his building blocks again.''</p>
        <p>A few months earlier, Perkins had brought her together with Hemingway. ''The man astonished me. I should have known, from your affection for him, that he was not a fire-spitting ogre. . . . Instead, a most lovable, nervous and sensitive person took my hand in a big gentle paw and remarked that he was a great admirer of my work. . . . There is, obviously, some inner conflict in Hemingway which makes him go about his work with a chip on his shoulder, and which makes him want to knock people down. He is so great an artist that he does not need to be ever on the defensive. He is so vast, so virile, that he does not need ever to hit anybody. Yet he is constantly defending something that he, at least, must consider vulnerable.''</p>
        <p>Often Max writes her about Wolfe. In 1935 he even urges her to ''write to Tom about his book and put a little hell into the letter. . . . It might be very effective. But there must be no collusion between us.'' This is an extraordinary gesture of trust, for Wolfe was Perkins's greatest worry as well as the writer he loved the most. A few years later the three of them are out together for an unlikely night on the tiles, and she writes to Perkins afterward, recalling ''Tom Wolfe plowing his way among the vegetables in a drizzle of rain at four o'clock in the morning, while you and I followed like pieces broken off from a meteor in transit. I shouldn't have started the argument about suicide in the Chinese dive if I'd known he would take it so personally! I have always found suicide a delightful abstraction for discussion, but when I found that he thought I was urging him to do it, and refused at the top of his lungs, 'even to satisfy his publishers,' I wished I had argued about something simple, like transcendentalism.'' Her outrage when Wolfe breaks away from Scribner's for another publisher evokes a characteristic response from Max, focusing on what he sees in Wolfe as ''a kind of desperate tearing himself loose in order to stand up alone. And of course that is what he ought to do, in fact, and must do, if he is to become a really great writer.''</p>
        <p>The tragic Oedipal drama of Perkins and Wolfe played itself out all too quickly, and when Tom died in 1938, having sent from his deathbed a moving and loving letter to Max, Rawlings wrote with her characteristic understanding and sympathy: ''I have grieved for you ever since I heard of Tom's death. I grieve, too, for the certain loss of the work he would unquestionably have done, for his very touching letter to you shows a chastening and mellowing of that great half-mad diffusive ego, that would have been a guarantee of the literary self-discipline we all so wanted for him. . . . I know how glad you must be that you never withdrew your personal goodness from Tom, even when others were bitter for you.''</p>
        <p>In fact, 1938 was a climactic year in many ways -- not only Wolfe's death and the overwhelming success of ''The Yearling'' but a dangerous illness and operation confronting Rawlings. By this time, writer and editor are so in tune that she can comment on his personal life in ways that few others would have dared. His wife, Louise, whom he had foolishly prevented from pursuing an acting career, has grown increasingly restive, and has moved toward a romantic Catholicism that severely tested the patience of the not very ardently Episcopal Perkins. Rawlings writes of her: ''She is very sweet and a little pathetic, and I understand her. You are so much wiser than she -- you must not be intolerant. The Catholic matter will probably fade away. I don't mean to be presumptuous in speaking so. But you know that.'' That he could break through his reticence to raise so personal a subject indicates both how troubled his feelings about Louise were and how much confidence he placed in Marjorie.</p>
        <p>Only weeks later, before going into the hospital, she wrote to him, ''If by chance I should not come out of it, I do wish I could make it clear to you and to everyone else interested in me for whatever reason, that it would be the sort of death that would not matter. . . . I have lived so full and rich a life, with so much more than my share of everything, that I feel indebted to life, instead of life's still being indebted to me.'' Perkins reacted with two uncharacteristic letters. One was to the man Rawlings was planning to marry, begging him to ''inform me as soon as you possibly can. We here are her publishers, but that has nothing to do with it. It is for personal reasons that I am concerned and I hope you will wire me as soon as you can after you hear the result of the operation and all. . . . I do not know to whom else I could turn, and I shall feel most anxious until I hear.'' To Marjorie herself, on the same day, he writes by hand, ''Even if I had never seen you, &amp; we had done everything by letter I should be profoundly concerned because the privilege -- which is what it was -- of cooperating with you as an Editor has been one of the happiest &amp; most satisfying experiences I have ever had, -- or ever shall -- &amp; I am most grateful for it.''</p>
        <p>If that is Max's most fervent moment with Marjorie, perhaps hers with him comes a year later, and can serve as an epitaph to their friendship: ''I think you must know how conscious I am of the special quality of our relationship. It existed from the beginning, in my recognition and appreciation of your great critical gift, and I cannot conceive of its being changed by anything. I should expect you to have the same patience with me, the same understanding of what I try to do, if the results were completely unsalable. And you must surely know that no material returns from my work could possibly be as important to me as the doing of the work; and that there is more satisfaction in your verdict of approval than in that of any best-seller list. When I have done the best I can with any piece of writing, and you say it is all right, then I am done with it. What happens in the way of money and awards and what not, is remote, and has no more connection with the work itself than would an inheritance from someone I had never heard of. My mental contact with you is a basic thing. I shall need it and want it and feel free to ask for it as long as I write. I could not imagine your withholding it, and you must not ever imagine for one moment that I could put other things ahead of it, or fail to appreciate it.'' (Max in reply: ''Being a Yankee, I am not very expressive, but I am mighty glad that you do value my opinions.'')</p>
        <p>''Max and Marjorie'' is a revelation of two extraordinary -- even noble -- characters, as well as something rarely found in books: a convincing account of an evolving friendship. The letters between Perkins and Fitzgerald are very different -- permeated by Scott's unfailing sweetness and generosity and acuity and by Max's unending concern for him, shoring him up psychologically, emotionally and financially (even lending him money). Fitzgerald discovers Hemingway and steers him to Perkins, and indeed is consistently brilliant on other writers -- from Sherwood Anderson to Raymond Radiguet. (In 1940, in his very last letter to Max, he writes, ''No one points out how Saroyan has been influenced by Franz Kafka. Kafka was an extraordinary Czechoslovakian Jew who died in '36. He will never have a wide public but 'The Trial' and 'America' are two books that writers are never able to forget.'') He also understands the role Max plays in the lives of his writers (this is in 1938): ''What a time you've had with your sons, Max -- Ernest gone to Spain, me gone to Hollywood, Tom Wolfe reverting to an artistic hill-billy.''</p>
        <p>The correspondence with Hemingway is compelling in other ways -- and a corrective to the current view of Hem. He generally comes across as manly rather than macho, perceptive rather than insensitive, explosive but quietly repentant -- a man strung out by the tension of trying to be a great writer. These letters are far more concerned with publishing matters than editorial ones. Max is at his most gingerly with editorial suggestions, and those he actually makes are, even more than usual, cloaked in hesitations and qualifications: ''I do think that bringing in a speech, just because it is one, does tend to make the book seem too miscellaneous perhaps. I would rather favor leaving it out.'' His prose is punctuated with quaint, almost fussy locutions: Heaven Knows ; I hope to thunder; I would like to do it mighty well. What amounts to his passive aggression is nailed by Hemingway: ''I have to have some one I can trust and can write frankly to and that person has always been you Max only now I can't write frankly about anything without fear of offending you.'' Yet on Max's death, Hemingway writes to Charles Scribner: ''We don't need to talk wet about Max to each other. . . . If it would do any good you might let it be known that while Max was my best and oldest friend at Scribner's and a great, great editor he never cut a paragraph of my stuff nor asked me to change one. One of my best and most loyal friends and wisest counselors in life as well as in writing is dead.''</p>
        <p>In the last half-century, publishing has drastically changed. To a great degree, the loyalties, decencies and courtesies of Perkins's day are gone. It is hardly true today that, as Max wrote to Marjorie in 1932, ''these times are very adverse to advances, and generally speaking, there is no occasion to pay one on a first novel.'' (Needless to say, literary agents were less active then.) Communication has speeded up -- when one of Marjorie's books is taken by the Book-of-the-Month Club, Max writes her the news, instead of telephoning -- but book production has slowed down; in the 30's, books were routinely published three or four months after a manuscript was completed. Finally, alas, a book like ''Max and Marjorie'' can never happen again -- extended letter writing is more or less a thing of the past. The one constant is editing: not just old-timers but ardent young men and women, in love with publishing, are still going home every night toting manuscripts -- and pencils. Even if they don't know it, they are acting in a tradition exemplified and strengthened by Maxwell Evarts Perkins.</p>
        <p>Max's effect on his writers, and on American letters, is amply illustrated not only in ''Max and Marjorie'' and the collections of correspondence with Fitzgerald, Hemingway and Wolfe (the complete Wolfe-Perkins correspondence is coming out next fall), but also in A. Scott Berg's esteemed biography; in an early collection of letters, ''Editor to Author''; and in the reminiscences of various colleagues and writers. But his effect on the generation of editors who followed him is less well understood. Certainly when I entered publishing, in 1955 -- eight years after his death -- Perkins was the great legend, given his unique combination of shrewdness, humility and editorial genius. How were young editors to measure up to this paragon? (Talk about the anxiety of influence!) Well, of course we couldn't, and then it stopped mattering. But there are still twinges. Rereading Scott Berg, I was foolishly pleased to realize that I live on the same enclosed garden in the East 40's where Perkins lived, and I was tickled at learning of Max's culinary arrangements. Apparently, Erskine Caldwell, then an unsuccessful Scribner writer, was being wooed by another publisher, who treated him to a sumptuous lunch. Caldwell, Berg writes, could not help silently comparing this reception with the one and only time Maxwell Perkins had bought him a meal. It was at a lunch counter. Max had ordered for both of them -- orange juice and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. I was reminded that after I had worked on a number of books with John le Carre, he had it inserted into a contract that I was to take him out at least once for a decent meal. Unknowingly, in this regard at least I had lived up to Maxwell Perkins.</p>
