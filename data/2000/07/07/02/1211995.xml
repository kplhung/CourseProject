        <p>Marlene Tejada's friends say she had been looking forward to seeing her 18-month-old goddaughter again.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tejada, 16, told the baby's mother, Belen Gonzalez, that she had missed the energetic toddler while mother and baby visited relatives in Miami last week. Ms. Tejada asked if the baby, Nebelyn, could spend a few nights at the apartment at 511 Quincy Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where she lives with her family, and Ms. Gonzalez, who lives nearby, agreed.</p>
        <p>But the baby was fussy when she awoke Friday morning, refusing the bottle of cold milk and strawberry syrup that Ms. Tejada prepared as the two watched television, the police and family members said.</p>
        <p>And when the toddler began pulling pots and pans and cleaning supplies from a cabinet beneath the kitchen sink, her young godmother lost her temper, the police said.</p>
        <p>A little more than an hour later, the baby was dead, and Ms. Tejada was charged yesterday with second-degree murder.</p>
        <p>She told investigators that she had ''tried to teach the child a lesson'' by pouring a pink cleaning solvent down her throat, a law enforcement official said.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Gonzalez and other family members said yesterday that they did not believe that the teenager, who dates Ms. Gonzalez's 19-year-old son, had killed the child. It was more likely, said Ms. Gonzalez's older daughter, Barbara Duenas, 16, that Nebelyn had ''gotten into something,'' as toddlers are wont to do.</p>
        <p>''It's an accident, but only God knows what really happened,'' Ms. Gonzalez, 41, said yesterday, sitting in her well-kept but cramped two-room apartment. She said Ms. Tejada was the only person she had trusted to take care of the baby.</p>
        <p>Ms. Duenas added: 'Marlene has been there since Day 1. Pampers, sneakers, whenever my mother said she needed something for the baby, she would always bring back double the next day.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday Ms. Gonzalez, her eyes bloodshot, slumped on the edge of her bed, weeping as she flipped through an album of baby photographs. A corner of the bedroom was devoted to the baby, where a blue mesh bag filled with Pokemon toys and pacifiers hung from the apartment's fuse box door over the crib.</p>
        <p>Around 10:30 on Friday morning, when Nebelyn rejected the bottle of milk and would not stop crying, Ms. Tejada phoned Ms. Gonzalez and asked what to do to calm the baby, according to family members and the authorities.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gonzalez cooed to the baby over the phone, and recommended a bottle of juice, Ms. Duenas said.</p>
        <p>As the teenager mixed some carrot juice and water, the toddler began making mischief under the kitchen sink, the authorities said. Ms. Tejada, according to another law enforcement official, started screaming, but the baby was intent on emptying out the cabinet under the sink.</p>
        <p>Enraged, Ms. Tejada then grabbed the infant by the jaw and poured the contents of a bottle down her throat, holding the child as she kicked and screamed and tried to break free, the official said.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the official said, the toddler gulped for air, and Ms. Tejada used a rag to wipe away the excess cleaning solvent, then began feeding her the juice mixture.</p>
        <p>But Nebelyn began to turn blue. Ms. Tejada took the baby into the bedroom and with her sister-in-law, tried to revive her and called 911.</p>
        <p>The baby was taken to Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead at 12:42 p.m.</p>
        <p>A police official quoted investigators as saying that the liquid in the bottle was probably a mixture of cleaning solvents.</p>
        <p>Nebelyn is the second child that Ms. Gonzalez has lost, she said. She gave birth in July 1982 to a baby with a deformed heart who died after 13 days.</p>
        <p>And yesterday, she was talking about funeral plans for another child, saying she wanted the baby to be cremated and have a service at St. Barbara's Roman Catholic Church nearby. ''I don't want her in the cemetery; the cemetery is too cold for her,'' Ms. Gonzalez said. ''She's an angel; I want her sleeping here.''</p>
