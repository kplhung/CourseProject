        <p>WITH the season of graduations, commencements, moving-up ceremonies and other end-of-year rituals just completed, one equally meaningful rite of passage, at least for parents, goes unremarked.</p>
        <p>As a suburban mother who drove her last official car pool a few days ago, I wish there had been something to acknowledge my new status and my ambivalence at reaching this milestone.</p>
        <p>I'm not quite sure what I expected -- a farewell bouquet, a certificate, a trumpet fanfare? But somehow, as I pulled into my driveway after delivering my son and a neighbor to high school for the last day of classes, and my daughter to middle school, locking the car door seemed anticlimactic.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was more poignant because my last official car pool duty coincided uncomfortably with my 16-year-old son's receiving his junior driver's license. In September, he, as a high school senior, will drive his younger sister to high school. No more early morning rush to get them both out the door with the right lunches and book bags, and no more waiting for the afternoon phone call to find out when to retrieve them.</p>
        <p>And as much as I griped and chafed about the restrictions that car-pooling responsibilities often imposed on my working day, I know how much I will miss the routine, and the privileged glimpse it gave me into my children's lives.</p>
        <p>When my husband and I moved to the suburbs with our nearly 2-year-old son, I soon realized that life revolved around car pools: car pools for nursery school, after-school play dates and classes, birthday parties and athletic events. Through the years, I got used to the inevitable question, ''Who are we car-pooling with?'' whenever another activity loomed on the calendar. I came to understand that chauffeuring duties were less of a burden and more of an opportunity to know my children and their friends in ways I couldn't have imagined.</p>
        <p>Nor am I alone in my ambivalence. For Florence Cohen of Hartsdale, who has a son in college and a daughter entering her senior year of high school, being liberated from car pooling is a decidedly mixed blessing.</p>
        <p>''I feel I have this new-found freedom, where I don't have to juggle my schedule,'' she said. ''But I miss listening to their conversations when we're in the car.''</p>
        <p>I know what she means. As a witness to their conversations and concerns, I easily learned who was friends with whom, the social hierarchy of their respective grades, which teachers rated highly and which ones made their lives miserable, as well as who was hot and who was not in popular music.</p>
        <p>Even when there isn't a clear end to the car-pooling role, its evolution marks a change for many mothers.</p>
        <p>''It's very gradual,'' said Donna Berliner of White Plains, whose youngest child just graduated from high school and who also has two older daughters. ''Car pools give way long before your child is driving by himself. Car pools are based on neighborhoods and are put together by mothers. When your child is about 12, car pools tend to disintegrate because your child wants to be with his friends. Everybody is running in a dozen directions, so you're actually ending car pools a lot earlier than you expected.''</p>
        <p>My suddenly leisurely mornings and unstructured afternoons now beckon with possibility, but also loss. I know that I am now, first through small doses and increasingly in larger ones, losing control, not only of where and how my teenage children go places, but also of the intimate knowledge of how they spend their days.</p>
        <p>For elusive and active teenagers, those few minutes every day in the car were often my only opportunity to have their undivided attention and keep up with their lives. When they were small, I used to sit at the edge of our driveway and rejoice as they first mastered their plastic riding toys, tricycles and bicycles and relished their daily steps toward independence. Now that the moment is almost here, I am torn by ambivalence, proud of whom they have become and mournful for my increasingly peripheral presence in their lives.</p>
        <p>And so, as I toss my son the car keys, along with a warning to be careful, I recognize that I am where I need to be, on the sidelines of my children's lives as they drive forward into the future.</p>
