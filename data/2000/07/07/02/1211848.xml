        <p>THE deciphering of the human genome, announced last week by rival public and private teams, promises to change the practice of medicine in profound ways in the decades to come. But for investors, whose focus may be a bit more short term, surprisingly little changed last week.</p>
        <p>Investing in medicine, whether the stocks of pharmaceutical giants or smaller biotechnology concerns, has always been about identifying those groups most likely to turn scientific discoveries into safe, effective drugs, and to manufacture and market them efficiently. One can also invest in tools companies -- the providers of chemical reagents, laboratory equipment and, increasingly, data, that are used to discover and develop new drugs, although these products usually offer lower margins.</p>
        <p>One of these tools companies, Celera Genomics Group, a unit of the PE Corporation, joined with the Human Genome Project, a consortium of academic centers, to announce last Monday that they had compiled a rough but nearly complete draft of the human genome. While the consortium's data becomes part of the public domain, Celera plans to sell access to its genome data by subscription, seeking in effect to become the Bloomberg of biology.</p>
        <p>Celera only has six subscribers, but some analysts said last week's news should spur others to sign up. One bullish analyst was Eric Schmidt of SG Cowen; the announcement, he said, ''will serve as an impetus to new collaborations, as Celera has clearly demonstrated its capabilities.''</p>
        <p>But there are many other ways to play the genomics card. Celera is actually a latecomer to the industry, compared with companies like Incyte Genomics, which has more than 20 subscribers to its database of genes, or Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Human Genome Sciences, both of which have sold data on a more limited basis and are concentrating on making drugs using genomics discoveries. Many mature biotech companies, like Amgen and Genentech, have genomics programs of their own, as do several big pharmaceutical companies.</p>
        <p>''We've been fairly negative on genomics stocks,'' said Stuart Weisbrod, a portfolio manager with the Merlin Biomed Group, a New York hedge fund. ''I don't think they reflect economic value yet, and there's been a big misconception on the part of the public that once you have a gene you can have a drug in a bottle in two years. It takes 10 years, and even then, most drugs fail.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, while sequencing the entire genome is a major scientific accomplishment, there is far more utility in sequencing individual genes whose functions will provide the target for new drugs. Merlin's only major holding in a genomics company is Incyte.</p>
        <p>''Incyte has a gene database which is already being used to develop drugs'' by more than 25 large drug company partners, Mr. Weisbrod said. ''They have over 500 issued patents with utility, and Celera has zero.'' (Merlin also has a small stake in Genset, the French genomics company, which he believes has been overlooked.)</p>
        <p>Kris Jenner, manager of the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences fund, is also an investor in Incyte, as well as in Affymetrix, which makes so-called gene chips used in analyzing genomics data, and PE Biosystems, Celera's sister company, which makes gene sequencing machines and other laboratory equipment, and which, unlike Celera, is profitable.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jenner said he did not believe that investors had to own shares of the genomics companies themselves to benefit from genomics discoveries. ''There will be many beneficiaries of that knowledge, and that includes the pharmaceuticals companies,'' he said. ''You don't necessarily have to have a concentrated focus in companies identified by Wall Street as 'genomics' companies.''</p>
        <p>Genomics is a consideration, but investments in drug companies should be based primarily on nearer-term factors, he said. ''There is not an immediate benefit likely to be seen by an investor in distant derivative players like a Pfizer, an Eli Lilly or a Genentech,'' he said, although he owns all three based on other merits.</p>
        <p>While genomics companies may have an edge in the research phase of producing a new therapy, mature biotechnology and large pharmaceutical concerns have proved  their ability to develop, manufacture and market drugs. All of these companies have access to genomics, whether through major collaborations or internal efforts.</p>
        <p>''The simple fact of life is drug discovery will be driven by a variety of tools applied to the raw data from the human genome; every company is going to do that,'' said Viren Mehta, head of Mehta Partners in New York. ''Nothing fundamental in the industry has changed, except we are going to apply these new insights. So we are focused on companies with management who we think have the vision to apply the new science successfully.''</p>
        <p>MR. MEHTA is an investor in Millennium and Human Genome Sciences but also looks for companies that can use genomics data most directly in drug discovery. These include Abgenix and the Cambridge Antibody Technology Group -- two producers of so-called monoclonal antibodies, genetically engineered copies of immune-system proteins -- as well as Transkaryotic Therapies, which has a novel gene-switch technology for producing proteins in the body. Among larger companies, he owns Pfizer, Pharmacia and American Home Products.</p>
