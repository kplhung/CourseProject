        <p>In 1845, Edgar Allan Poe, the dark knight of American literature, moved into a cottage at 85 West Third Street, where he lived for a brief time. Now scholars and preservationists are urging New York University, which owns the property, not to tear it down.</p>
        <p>The university plans to demolish the house and three adjacent buildings to erect a tower as high as 13 stories.</p>
        <p>Poe and his ailing wife lived in the four-story red brick cottage for several months. More than 70 scholars and professors argue that Poe wrote  some of his best works there, like his short story ''The Cask of Amontillado.''</p>
        <p>''Poe published his first substantial compilation of poetry, achieved his lifelong dream of acquiring his own literary magazine and worked on at least three important short stories,'' says a petition signed by scholars and others.</p>
        <p>The Municipal Art Society and other preservation groups have also criticized the university's plan to demolish the row of buildings near the Poe house. The proposed tower, they say, would radically alter the area.</p>
        <p>But N.Y.U. officials maintain that Poe did not create anything of significance during his stay. Besides, they argue, the exterior and interior of the house have been heavily altered during its various incarnations as an Italian cafe, a gay dance bar, a fraternity house and, currently, law school offices.</p>
        <p>Lynne Brown, a university spokeswoman, said N.Y.U. officials had met with community groups and had asked its architects to study the feasibility of alternate plans.</p>
        <p>But time appears to be running out for the cottage. The city's Landmarks Preservation Commission recently declined to take up the matter and the Department of Buildings has issued demolition permits.</p>
        <p>''By the end of the summer, the law school will want to move ahead,''  Ms. Brown said.</p>
