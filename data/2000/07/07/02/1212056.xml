        <p>Jose Valentin, making his first major league start in the outfield, hit a bases-loaded triple and host Chicago beat Boston by 7-2 yesterday</p>
        <p>Valentin, a shortstop starting in right field because Magglio Ordonez was out with a sore knee, cleared the bases to cap a four-run sixth inning as Chicago won for the 21st time in 28 games.</p>
        <p>Mike Sirotka (8-6) allowed four hits and a run in eight innings to win for the fifth time in six decisions.</p>
        <p>Boston outhit the White Sox, 6-5. But the Red Sox, their lineup ravaged by injuries, made three errors, and right fielder Izzy Alcantara was slow getting to two other balls that fell in front of him.</p>
        <p>The defensive effort ruined a decent performance by Paxton Crawford (0-1) in his major league debut. Crawford gave up four hits in five and one-third innings, but only three of the six runs against him were earned.</p>
        <p>ORIOLES 12, BLUE JAYS 5: Harold Baines homered twice, and Will Clark and Charles Johnson also connected as host Baltimore beat Toronto.</p>
        <p>Baines hit a solo shot in the third inning and put Baltimore up by</p>
        <p>10-1 with a three-run drive in the fifth. It was the 13th two-homer game of his career.</p>
        <p>Sidney Ponson (5-4) pitched an eight-hitter and tied his career high with nine strikeouts to help Baltimore to its fourth victory in five games. Before their 8-3 victory Friday, the Orioles had lost 13 straight to the Blue Jays since April 10, 1999.</p>
        <p>Raul Mondesi homered for Toronto but left the game in the fifth inning after injuring his right ankle chasing down a ball in right field. The severity of the injury was not immediately known.</p>
        <p>TWINS 4, INDIANS 3: Denny Hocking lined a two-run single in the 10th inning as visiting Minnesota rallied to beat Cleveland.</p>
        <p>The Twins scored the tying run in the ninth on Cristian Guzman's two-out single.</p>
        <p>The Minnesota starter Brad Radke gave up seven hits and struck out seven in eight innings.</p>
        <p>Radke, eligible for free agency at the end of the season and the subject of trade rumors, and the Twins are close to a four-year contract extension that would be worth $36 million.</p>
        <p>Steve Karsay (1-5) walked Midre Cummings to open the Twins 10th and Matt Lawton followed with an infield single. After Ron Coomer grounded into a double play, Corey Koskie was intentionally walked.</p>
        <p>Hocking foiled the strategy with a line single to right.</p>
        <p>Eddie Guardado (4-2) gave up a solo homer to Ricky Ledee with one out in the 10th. Ledee hit his first home run since being traded from the Yankees in the deal for David Justice this week.</p>
        <p>Bob Wells got the last out for his sixth save.</p>
        <p>TIGERS 8, ROYALS 7: Rob Fick's run-scoring single tied the score in the ninth, then Ricky Bottalico walked Rich Becker with the bases loaded to force in the winning run as visiting Detroit outlasted Kansas City.</p>
        <p>Bottalico (7-2) gave up singles to Tony Clark and Dean Palmer starting the ninth as he blew his sixth save in 11 opportunities.</p>
        <p>Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his league-leading 22nd save.</p>
        <p>Jorge Fabregas hit a two-out solo homer in the eighth off Doug Brocail (4-3) to cap Kansas City's comeback and give the Royals a 7-6 lead.</p>
        <p>Palmer, 3 for 4 with three runs batted in, and Bobby Higginson each hit their 16th home runs as the Tigers mounted a six-run lead in the sixth.</p>
