        <p>Alonda Martin, Wendy Strite, Becky Martin, Esther Myers, July 4, 1999, Hyde County, N.C.</p>
        <p>Alonda Martin (left): ''Wendy's my first cousin. Esther Myers is the deacon's wife. Becky is my aunt and also my sister-in-law. I married her husband's brother. My sister also married another one of the brothers. It's sort of strange. But I'm 21, and I was seven months pregnant, and I was really enjoying getting together to talk about God and talk about the everyday, telling each other our struggles. I find real comfort in talking to the older ladies in my church. It's simple living. I don't do it because it's old-fashioned; I do it because I feel that that's what God requires of me. It wasn't a real hard decision for me. ''</p>

        <p>Alonda Martin, Wendy Strite, Becky Martin, Esther Myers, July 4, 1999, Hyde County, N.C.</p>
        <p>Alonda Martin (left): ''Wendy's my first cousin. Esther Myers is the deacon's wife. Becky is my aunt and also my sister-in-law. I married her husband's brother. My sister also married another one of the brothers. It's sort of strange. But I'm 21, and I was seven months pregnant, and I was really enjoying getting together to talk about God and talk about the everyday, telling each other our struggles. I find real comfort in talking to the older ladies in my church. It's simple living. I don't do it because it's old-fashioned; I do it because I feel that that's what God requires of me. It wasn't a real hard decision for me. ''</p>
        <p>Wendy Strite (second from left): ''Becky had invited us over for lunch. We often do that after church on Sunday. It's just a quiet, peaceful life -- whatever the Bible says, we do, even if it's sometimes inconvenient.</p>
        <p>I once tried baby-sitting, but our home life suffered. And I wasn't any further ahead. Other women might be able to do it if they really try hard, but I lost my calm just trying keep up. I stopped and since then I've been a keeper-at-home like God says we should be. That's Esther, she's my grandmother, my mom's mother. Becky is my aunt, and Alonda is my cousin. Oh, you would shake your head if you came to our family gatherings.''</p>
        <p>Becky Martin (second from right): ''I'm a Mennonite, and the Bible says show hospitality without grudging. I imagine I was making roast beef, mashed potatoes, gravy and corn. Usually my husband will mash the potatoes. A lot of men don't know how to cook. But he's better at making the gravy than I am. I've told some people already. I told people that I knew wouldn't care, like my sister -- she'll like me just as good if I made the gravy or not. Other people would just be shocked.''</p>
        <p>Esther Myers (right): ''I remember I was enjoying the visit. I'm in my 60's, and they were all younger, in their 20's or 30's, but we have really good fellowship together. We're Mennonites, so we don't conform to styles and fashions. We keep to ourselves. We don't have TV or radio. We all love the same Lord. So there's not quite the generational gap that the rest of the world would have. It's comforting. Especially for an older person who doesn't really like a lot of change.''</p>
