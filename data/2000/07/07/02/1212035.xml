        <p>Letter from Don Mennie on William Safire's thoughts on Social Security in his June 26 Op-Ed column</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>William Safire argues that a later retirement age is ''the key to what alarmists label 'saving Social Security' '' (column, June 26). While it is true that people are living longer, I see no evidence that those extra years are so robust and healthy that they should be burdened with career obligations.  There is ample evidence, however, that employers are addicted to youth.</p>
        <p>The chief executives of dot-coms brag about how they never hire anyone over 35, while brick-and-mortar businesses dump older workers when they merge or the economy dips. How will our vast but aging population support itself if employers won't hire older workers and the government won't let them retire with dignity?</p>

        <p>A sea change in marketplace attitudes and medical technology will be needed before we change the retirement age to 72 and beyond.</p>
