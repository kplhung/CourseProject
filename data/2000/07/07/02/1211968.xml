        <p>A judge today convicted 10 of 13 Jewish men accused by the Revolutionary Court of being spies, asserting that their years of religious piety were a cover for espionage and illegal aid to Iran's enemy, Israel.</p>
        <p>The men -- shopkeepers, Hebrew teachers, a part-time rabbi, an English professor and an electrical utility official -- were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 4 to 13 years. Most were convicted of being members of an illegal group, recruiting others to join it and of ''cooperating'' with Israel.</p>
        <p>Two Muslim men convicted of aiding the spy ring were also convicted and sentenced, to two and four years. Two other Muslims, arrested because they had dealings with some of the Jewish defendants, were acquitted along with three Jews.</p>
        <p>The case has been closely monitored by Western governments as an indicator of Iran's adherence to international principles of justice and human rights. Several European countries and the United States have said the conduct and outcome of the trial would affect their future relations with Iran.</p>
        <p>The verdicts were condemned outside and inside Iran.</p>
        <p>In Washington, President Clinton said in a statement he was ''deeply disturbed'' by the verdicts and called on Iran to overturn the sentences.</p>
        <p>''The proceedings have been rightly criticized around the world for their failure to accord due process of law to the defendants,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Shiraz, where many of the convicted men were counted among the religious leaders of the close-knit group of 6,000 Jews here, the mood was grim at Sabbath services at the city's biggest Jewish gathering place, Rebbezedde Synagogue.</p>
        <p>''This is unbearable for the Jewish community because these were religious people who guided us and were our leaders,'' said one woman who refused to give her name. She and a dozen other women who gathered to speak about the trial said they all wanted to emigrate. The court's ruling, she said, is a warning that to be an observant Jew in Iran is grounds for suspicion.</p>
        <p>''We feel insecure,'' the woman added. ''At the office where I work, my colleagues act differently toward me now. It's worse than it was for us at the beginning of the revolution.''</p>
        <p>Esmail Naseri Mojarrad, the spokesman for the three-lawyer team that began representing most defendants only days before the trial began, said he would appeal the convictions if family members wished.</p>
        <p>An appeal, he added, would be based on the absence of any evidence other than the Jews' own confessions, which he dismissed as invalid because they were made by men who had been in prison for nearly 16 months without access to lawyers.</p>
        <p>The court did not prove, Mr. Naseri Mojarrad said, that the men passed or even had access to classified information: ''So if they are not guilty of collecting information, exactly what kind of cooperation are they supposed to have given?''</p>
        <p>Eight of the defendants confessed in court to spying and two of those were paraded before cameras of the state television channel to repeat their statements for national broadcast. Jewish leaders in Iran have harshly criticized the televised confessions as fostering general mistrust of Jews.</p>
        <p>But Iranian officials have gone to unusual lengths to defend their handling of the case, denouncing the international attention as interference in internal affairs.</p>
        <p>In a rare gesture, the 72-page decision of the Revolutionary Court judge, Sadegh Nouri, was read by a court official to reporters and foreign diplomats who have monitored the trial since late April.</p>
        <p>The norm for the Revolutionary Court, which handles political trials as well as drug-smuggling and national security matters, is not to announce a verdict at all, and to keep both trials and evidence secret.</p>
        <p>Hussein Ali Amiri, the head of the provincial judiciary in Shiraz who gave unusual weekly briefings during the trial, said each defendant had faced five separate charges relating to spying, each carrying a possible sentence of 10 years in prison.</p>
        <p>The men could also have been charged with a special count in Iran's Islamic penal code -- acting against God -- that carries the death penalty. But the judge, who also acted as the prosecutor under Iranian law, decided against that charge, Mr. Amiri said.</p>
        <p>While the case has traumatized Iran's Jews, a dwindling population of about 30,000, it has not reverberated through the country as a whole. Iranians have been absorbed, instead, in the political battles between reformers allied with President Mohammad Khatami and religious conservatives who control the judiciary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khatami has not commented on the trial except to assure foreign visitors that it would be fair and that the court would act independently.</p>
        <p>But the convictions may have a tangible impact on his efforts to create warmer relations with the West. Last week, a planned visit for July 4 by the British foreign minister, Robin Cook, was abruptly canceled. In just over a week, Mr. Khatami is scheduled to visit Germany.</p>
        <p>The European Union issued a statement from France, which has just assumed its rotating chairmanship, calling for a reversal of the convictions.</p>
        <p>Judge Nourani's decision today gave few details of the activities the convicted men were supposed to have conducted on behalf of Israel. But it did indicate that Jews in Iran have been monitored by intelligence agents, even though investigation in this case was said to have begun only in October 1998.</p>
        <p>The judge's long narrative accused some of the Jewish men of working for Israel for more than 20 years, since before the Islamic revolution that overthrew the shah in 1979. It said the espionage group began under the tutelage of a Shiraz rabbi identified only as Itzhak, who passed information to Israel's secret service, Mossad, by telephone and fax and through traveling Iranians.</p>
        <p>''Why was the network so extensive?'' the judge wrote in one section. ''Because, according to the accused, it was founded on the basis of Judaism and its success was due to the fact it tried to keep religion alive.''</p>
        <p>Shiraz Jews, speaking privately, said that Itzhak is their former rabbi, Itzhak Balalaness, who emigrated to the United States in 1991.</p>
        <p>The rabbi, they said, was a charismatic and active figure who helped revitalize Jewish life in Shiraz. Several of the men convicted in the spy trial were quoted in the judge's report praising the rabbi.</p>
        <p>One, Farhad Seleh, was reported to have said: ''He created love for Israel in our hearts. He used to say that serving Israel was like serving Torah and that in our Jewish books it says that we should move before others move against us.''</p>
        <p>The judge said that the spy network, as he called it, had collected information about the location of military bases and information about Iran's politics, culture and economy. Only two defendants, however, were convicted of passing information.</p>
