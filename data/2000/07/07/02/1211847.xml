        <p>THE SETTING -- The cool, vaultlike showrooms of Omo Norma Kamali,  designer known for her bare-it-all bikinis and stretchy swimsuits. Not only is it a sample sale day at the 56th Street store, but also, the Fourth of July holiday looms. With casual desperation, shoppers examine more than 30 styles of suits in a rainbow of fruity colors, shimmery metals and predator skins. At discounts of 40 to 75 percent, prices are $25 to $123.</p>
        <p>Top 40 music thumps over the sound system, and when a TLC song, ''Damn Unpretty,'' starts to play, a shopper looks up with a wry smile.</p>

        <p>THE SETTING -- The cool, vaultlike showrooms of Omo Norma Kamali,  designer known for her bare-it-all bikinis and stretchy swimsuits. Not only is it a sample sale day at the 56th Street store, but also, the Fourth of July holiday looms. With casual desperation, shoppers examine more than 30 styles of suits in a rainbow of fruity colors, shimmery metals and predator skins. At discounts of 40 to 75 percent, prices are $25 to $123.</p>
        <p>Top 40 music thumps over the sound system, and when a TLC song, ''Damn Unpretty,'' starts to play, a shopper looks up with a wry smile.</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- ''How do you put this on?''</p>
        <p>''Is there anything in small and red?''</p>
        <p>''Does this go? Does this cover up all the fat?''</p>
        <p>Voices float up from the tiny dressing rooms as Anne Westphal, in a business suit, pulls out the Babe in black. Ms. Kamali is a baseball fan, and her 2000 collection of swimwear is named for her favorites: the Daryl, the Sammy, the Bernie and so on. The Babe is a one-piece with two gaping cutouts on the sides from  waist to hips. It is sexy, especially in cire, a popular Lycra material that looks like leather.</p>
        <p>''See, I like this one,'' Ms. Westphal, 30, says of the Babe in black. ''I just need a bathing suit for summer, something different. But everything here is small!''</p>
        <p>A minute later, Fran Harris asks, ''Why don't they have this in a small?'' Ms. Harris, 42, a fashion broker in braids and brown bandanna, has gone to Kamali sample sales for years. Her arms are laden with shiny black suits. ''I love this woman!'' Ms. Harris says, praising Ms. Kamali's flattering fabrics and geometric cutouts. ''She's like the Coach bag of swimming suits.''</p>
        <p>She adds: ''She covers the poor spots and makes us look sexy. See?''  She swings a suit toward another woman standing in the Orlando and a sheared cover-up. The woman smiles shyly. She is not as enthusiastic about her ensemble.</p>
        <p>''Usually it's easier, but I'm having trouble today,'' she says. ''I'm a mother of four, so I'm looking for the suit to manage them in and look pretty.''</p>
        <p>There is a friendly feel today, with no jockeying for dressing rooms or quick grabs for suits newly hung up. Perhaps it is because Kamali is not crowded today, or because swimsuit shopping is such a vulnerable act.</p>
        <p>When the mother of four reemerges in a low-cut number with  prominent slits, a cluster of women is waiting with encouragement.</p>
        <p>''How can I wear this?'' she cries out. ''I'm pushing it.''</p>
        <p>''You look great!''</p>
        <p>''But look at this hole!''</p>
        <p>''Well, maybe you're right. That one's a little low.''</p>
        <p>A round of giggles, and then it's back to the racks for the Mariano.</p>
