      <abstract>
        <p>Parking garage near United Nations building, with 179 parking spaces, sells for $7.5 million cash, or $40,000 for each space; realtor says price was so high because of location and because of bidding war (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The parking garage at 100 United Nations Plaza does not look much different from other parking garages in the tonier parts of Manhattan, but its 179 parking spaces are thought to have had the highest price tags in New York. The $7.5 million cash purchase price for the garage, just off the northeast corner of 48th Street and First Avenue, with entrances on both 47th and 48th Streets, works out to more than $40,000 for each space.</p>
        <p>But those who have -- or want -- everything, even a $40,000 parking space, will have to content themselves with parking there hourly (from $15), daily ($16 to $25) or monthly ($435, $470 for a SUV). The garage, a  condominium at the bottom of a 52-story building, and its parking spaces are not for sale individually. The garage condominium was sold in April by the Albanese Development Corporation to the Quik Park corporation, headed by Hank Sopher.</p>

The garage, a  condominium at the bottom of a 52-story building, and its parking spaces are not for sale individually. The garage condominium was sold in April by the Albanese Development Corporation to the Quik Park corporation, headed by Hank Sopher.</p>
        <p>The garage sold for as much as it did in part because of its location, but largely because several bidders got into a bidding war, according to Robert A. Knakal of Massey Knakal Real Estate Services, who represented both parties in the transaction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knakal said that the Trump World Tower project directly across the street also probably sparked bidder interest.</p>
        <p>POSTINGS: 179 SPACES NEAR THE UNITED NATIONS  Correction:  July 16, 2000, Sunday  A report in the Postings column on July 2 about the purchase of a garage misstated its location and one of its entrance streets. The garage is just off the northwest corner of 48th Street and First Avenue, not the northeast corner. In addition to its entrance on 48th Street it has an entrance on 49th Street, not 47th.</p>
