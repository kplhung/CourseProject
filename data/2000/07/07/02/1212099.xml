        <p>Q The board of the co-op I live in decided some time ago that one way to raise money for the co-op would be to offer shares in the roof to residents of the top floor. Those shareholders would be able to purchase the right to build up from their apartments and onto the roof. The area around those new floors would be turned into a roof garden that would be accessible to all shareholders. The board appointed a committee to investigate the plan's feasibility. One member of the committee is the chairman of the co-op, who also owns one of the top-floor apartments. Does the board have the right to make such decisions and to go as far as spending money obtaining city approvals? . . . Judith M. Kass, Manhattan.</p>

        <p>Q The board of the co-op I live in decided some time ago that one way to raise money for the co-op would be to offer shares in the roof to residents of the top floor. Those shareholders would be able to purchase the right to build up from their apartments and onto the roof. The area around those new floors would be turned into a roof garden that would be accessible to all shareholders. The board appointed a committee to investigate the plan's feasibility. One member of the committee is the chairman of the co-op, who also owns one of the top-floor apartments. Does the board have the right to make such decisions and to go as far as spending money obtaining city approvals? . . . Judith M. Kass, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A Andrew S. Berkman, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that the powers of a co-op board are subject to what is known as the business judgment rule established by the New York State Court of Appeals. Mr. Berkman said that under the rule, the courts will not interfere with actions taken by boards if those actions were taken in good faith and in furtherance of corporate purposes, and are within the scope of the board's authority.</p>
        <p>''All of the foregoing are subject to interpretation,'' he said. ''But if there has been adequate disclosure about the board's actions, and if the co-op as a whole will benefit, the directors are likely to be acting within the scope of their authority.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berkman said that shareholders who disagree with the board's actions should carefully review the bylaws and the proprietary lease to determine whether there is any language that would prevent the board from taking the action it proposes.</p>
        <p>He said that since the roof garden would constitute an improvement of the building, and since the issuance of additional shares should ultimately reduce the maintenance charges paid by all other shareholders, the plan seems not only feasible but perhaps beneficial to tenant-shareholders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berkman said that it would be important for the board to get independent fair-market appraisals for the sale of the proposed new shares.  He said it would also be prudent for the board to ensure that the costs of the proposed transaction -- including additional insurance premiums, consulting costs, legal expenses and appraisal fees -- be borne by the buyers of the roof rights.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Berkman said, it would be proper for those purchasers to bear the cost of obtaining the new certificate of occupancy that would have to be issued at the completion of construction.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Berkman said, while there would not be anything illegal about the chairman of the co-op serving on the new committee, it might be appropriate for him to abstain from voting on the matter as a board member since he stands to benefit personally.</p>
        <p>Insurance Coverage On Termites</p>
        <p>Q Is termite damage usually covered by the standard homeowner's insurance policy. If such coverage is separate, how much does it cost? . . . Hal Gunwalt, the Bronx.</p>
        <p>A Jean Salvatore, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute, an insurance industry trade organization based in Manhattan, said that standard homeowner's insurance policies do not cover termite damage. Ms. Salvatore added that she is not aware of any insurance carriers that provide such coverage.</p>
        <p>''Insurers usually exclude termite and vermin infestations from their policies,'' Ms. Salvatore said. ''Such problems are considered a property maintenance issue, and it is usually up to the homeowner to properly maintain the home.''</p>
