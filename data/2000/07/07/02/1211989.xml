        <p>Al Leiter was excused from Shea Stadium early on Friday night. He drove back to his Manhattan apartment and was about to pull into the parking garage under his building. Then he reconsidered.</p>
        <p>Underground, Leiter knew, he would lose the radio signal from the Mets-Braves game. So he stayed in the car at the corner of 83rd Street and First Avenue and listened as Edgardo Alfonzo singled in two runs and Mike Piazza drove in three with a home run. Leiter's teammates had completed a stunning comeback with a 10-run inning.</p>
        <p>''It was almost even better,'' Leiter said, ''because when you listen to it on radio, you can just imagine.''</p>
        <p>Leiter did not have to imagine yesterday. The rivalry was right there before him, and the Mets left-hander embraced it -- as a pitcher and as a hitter. He worked seven strong innings, striking out a season-high 12 batters, and stroked an improbable single to ignite a scoring outburst as the Mets pounded the Braves and Greg Maddux, 9-1.</p>
        <p>Derek Bell had four hits for the Mets, who have won 9 of their last 10 games and can pull even with Atlanta for first place in the National League East with a victory today.</p>
        <p>The Mets' stirring memories of Friday night's 11-8 victory had not faded yesterday morning. Shortstop Melvin Mora spoke of standing on base, praying that Alfonzo would deliver. Manager Bobby Valentine reflected on the last time he had seen a team score nine runs with two outs in its last time at bat.</p>
        <p>Piazza noticed that his teammates seemed upbeat, more relaxed. That game meant something, Alfonzo said. The Mets know they can beat the Braves, he said, and now they can focus less on the umpires -- who they believe sometimes allow a bigger strike zone for Atlanta pitchers -- and more on simply executing.</p>
        <p>The Mets went out and piled on the National League's superpower yesterday. But if they accomplished anything special from that, they were not saying. Blowout victories are quickly forgotten, and there may be no carry-over effect.</p>
        <p>''You wish there was,'' Mets third baseman Robin Ventura said, ''but if you get a pitcher that's throwing great, there's no carry-over. It all depends on how your pitching is and how their pitching is.''</p>
        <p>Leiter (10-1) pitched effectively and deep into the game, as he has all season, allowing six hits and three walks in his seven innings. The Mets have lost only 2 of his 16 starts, and he seems certain to make the All-Star team.</p>
        <p>His counterpart yesterday may also make that team but was not nearly himself in the early going. Maddux lasted only two innings, his shortest outing in four years, and allowed seven runs on seven hits. His pitches were up and he seemed exhausted, but Maddux said he felt fine despite missing Thursday's start with the flu.</p>
        <p>With one out in the first inning, Bell bounced a double over third base and moved to third on a groundout. Piazza struck out on a sinker in the dirt, but the pitch was wild, getting away from catcher Fernando Lunar, and Bell raced home as Piazza beat Lunar's throw to first. The Mets led, 1-0, and Leiter would help them extend the lead.</p>
        <p>Leiter boasted this spring that after many years, he had finally found his swing. A .103 career hitter, Leiter declared that he would belt his first home run this year. In fact, he has been awful, with just 2 singles in 31 at-bats (.065) before yesterday.</p>
        <p>But after Benny Agbayani bashed a two-out, bases-empty home run to give the Mets a 2-0 lead in the second, Leiter flared a single to left.</p>
        <p>''I just saw it and slapped it and got lucky,'' Leiter said.</p>
        <p>For Maddux, the single was disastrous. He had failed to retire the pitcher, and by the time he got another out, the Mets had scored five more runs.</p>
        <p>Mora and Bell doubled. Alfonzo singled. Maddux got a visit from the pitching coach, Leo Mazzone, but Piazza clanged his next pitch off the camera pavilion in center field for his 23rd home run. The Mets had a 7-0 lead, and every run came with two outs.</p>
        <p>''It was unreal,'' Braves Manager Bobby Cox said.</p>
        <p>It must have seemed that way to Leiter, who was expecting a close game. He wound up getting his 100th career victory, a milestone he doubted he could achieve when he was struggling with injuries a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Leiter was also relieved to win so he could relax and enjoy his postgame appointment. He drove back to Manhattan again for a Bruce Springsteen concert at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>Leiter is a longtime fan who has Springsteen music played over the public address system before he pitches. If things keep going this well for the Mets, one song may be especially appropriate: ''Glory Days.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>MIKE PIAZZA extended his streak of games with a run batted in to 14. He is three games from tying the 78-year-old record held by the Chicago Cubs' Ray Grimes. . . . DEREK BELL has scored a run in 11 games in a row, a Mets record, and has a 12-game hitting streak in which he is batting .465. Bell said he was concentrating on pulling the ball and simply reacting when he was pitched away, and that was helping him hit to the opposite field. . . .  General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS said the right-hander GRANT ROBERTS was on a pitch count on Friday night for Class AAA Norfolk, in case the Mets want to promote him to start for RICK REED on Tuesday. Roberts used his changeup more, but had a subpar outing over 70 pitches. The Mets are not saying whether Roberts, BOBBY M. JONES or PAT MAHOMES will take Reed's place.</p>
