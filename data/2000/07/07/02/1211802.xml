        <p>TIME flies when you're having fun. Zip-zap, and suddenly the year is halfway over.</p>
        <p>Trouble is, for most investors the last six months have not been a lot of laughs. All three major market indexes are under water for the year.</p>
        <p>The last time that happened was in 1994, according to Birinyi &amp; Associates, a stock market research firm. And the midyear tally stands in sharp relief to the first six months of 1999, when the Dow Jones industrial average was up nearly 20 percent, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up almost 12 percent and the Nasdaq gained 22.5 percent.</p>
        <p>But that's old news. The issue now is what happens from here to New Year's Eve.</p>
        <p>Byron R. Wien, chief United States investment strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, took some time last week to revisit the recent past and to talk about the next six months. Following are excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. Did the market pan out in the first half as you thought it might?</p>
        <p>A. From the beginning of the year, I thought the market was going to have a rough time of it. The first six months haven't been as rough as I thought they would be, but it has been a difficult market. This is the first year in the last six that it has had a difficult time.</p>
        <p>I also thought that people would begin to take a tougher look at technology stocks. And I anticipated that the price of oil would go up to $30 a barrel and stay there. I thought that would benefit energy and oil and service stocks, and it has, but not as much as I thought.</p>
        <p>Q. Some people think the Fed is about done tightening, and that the market is poised to do better when it stops. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>A. I think it is naive to think the economy will slow down enough for the Fed to indicate publicly that they are done.</p>
        <p>The Fed might move to a neutral policy position. The economy is clearly slowing as it responds to a deceleration in money supply growth, and that will take some near-term pressure off interest rates.</p>
        <p>I don't think a recession is anywhere in sight, but I do think we are going to have slower growth and a deceleration in profit growth. But inflation is going up. So I don't think the Fed will tell investors to relax.</p>
        <p>Q. Does that mean the market will remain under pressure for the balance of the year?</p>
        <p>A. Since the market's performance in the first half was a bit better than I had anticipated, it means the second half will be a little worse than I had hoped. By the end of the year, I expect the major averages will be within 10 percentage points of where they finished in 1999. Basically, this is not going to be a big money-making year.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you expect more market volatility?</p>
        <p>A. I don't know if conditions will be as volatile as they were, but I expect volatility to stay high.</p>
        <p>The volatility we have seen is not due to the Fed, which is doing what is expected. It has to do with the fact that people are trying too hard. They are used to making a lot of money in the stock market, and they are impatient. They tend to migrate to where the action is, which is what creates the volatility. But there will not be a lot of discernible trends over the next six months.</p>
        <p>Q. Has the correction we have seen in technology stocks made them attractive buys?</p>
        <p>A. I own a lot of technology stocks, and I like a lot of technology stocks, but it is hard for me to say there are a lot of outstanding values here. Even the technology stocks I bought recently, JDS Uniphase and Brocade, are not cheap. Intel, another favorite of mine, is not cheap.</p>
        <p>Q. Are there stocks you think should do well over the next six months or more?</p>
        <p>A. I still think energy stocks will do well. I think there are some opportunities in old-economy stocks, including financials. Biotechnology and health care companies intrigue me. And hospital management companies are undervalued, even though they have come back a bit.</p>
        <p>As far as individual names are concerned, in hospital management I like Columbia/ HCA [HCA -- the Healthcare Company], Tenet Health Care and Health Management Associates. Immunex is a biotech company I like. And in energy I like Tosco, Exxon Mobil and BP Amoco.</p>
        <p>Q. Will the results of the November election matter to the stock market?</p>
        <p>A. The only way the election could have an impact is if the same party wins control of both the White House and Congress. If that happens it would be bad. The status quo has been fine for financial markets.</p>
        <p>It would be bad because if Gore wins and the Democrats take the House, his spending programs will be negative for the market. And if Bush wins and the Republicans keep control in Congress, his tax program will go through. But it will be too stimulative and result in additional tightening.</p>
