        <p>A decision by the top policy-making body of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) on Friday to amend the church's constitution to forbid ministers from officiating at same-sex unions now moves the controversy over the issue to the local level among Presbyterians, as the question of whether to ratify the amendment is taken up within the church's regional jurisdictions later this year.</p>
        <p>The amendment -- stating that neither church property nor church officers may be involved in any blessing of same-sex unions -- will  become binding within the 2.6 million-member denomination only if it is approved by two-thirds of the 173 presbyteries, the regional jurisdictions, within the next year.</p>

        <p>A decision by the top policy-making body of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) on Friday to amend the church's constitution to forbid ministers from officiating at same-sex unions now moves the controversy over the issue to the local level among Presbyterians, as the question of whether to ratify the amendment is taken up within the church's regional jurisdictions later this year.</p>
        <p>The amendment -- stating that neither church property nor church officers may be involved in any blessing of same-sex unions -- will  become binding within the 2.6 million-member denomination only if it is approved by two-thirds of the 173 presbyteries, the regional jurisdictions, within the next year.</p>
        <p>As a result, Presbyterians throughout the nation may become involved in emotional and divisive debates, similar to the one that engaged those attending the denomination's General Assembly, the policy-making body, during its annual meeting here. The meeting, which began on June 24, concluded today.</p>
        <p>Late Friday, by a vote of 268 to 251, the assembly's commissioners approved the amendment that rules out any official sanction of same-sex unions, declaring instead that the Bible and the church's historic confessions of faith ''teach that God's intention for all people is to live either in fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman or in chastity in singleness.''</p>
        <p>And in another display of how divided church leaders are over this matter, the committee that recommended the amendment was similarly split, urging its adoption by a vote of 25 to 22.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the Rev. Jerry Anderson, a Glen Ellyn, Ill., minister who heads the Presbyterian Coalition, an organization that supports a prohibition on clergy officiating at same-sex unions, said he expected the presbyteries to back the amendment overwhelmingly.</p>
        <p>Presbyterians in the pews, he said, tend to be more conservative than those who attend the General Assembly. ''A close vote here does not mean a close vote there,'' Mr. Anderson said, referring to the meetings of the presbyteries, which will begin later this year and continue through next spring, concluding before the assembly meeting in June 2001.</p>
        <p>But some commissioners at the assembly who opposed the amendment said they did not accept Mr. Anderson's prediction, and said recent Presbyterian history was on their side. In 1994, the assembly approved a similar amendment. But in the voting among the presbyteries later that year and early the next, it fell short of the two-thirds majority necessary for it to become part of the denomination's constitution.</p>
        <p>The question of how major religious organizations should relate to gay men and lesbians in their pews has become one of the most contentious issues they face. And the responses of religious bodies show how widely divided they are, one from another, on such questions as whether to permit their clergy to officiate at same-sex unions, or whether to ordain gays as clergy members.</p>
        <p>In March, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, which represents the spiritual leaders of more than 800 Reform synagogues in North America, became the largest religious organization in the nation to adopt a policy supporting its members if they choose to officiate at same-sex unions. But two months later, the United Methodist Church, the second-largest Protestant denomination in the country, voted to affirm a four-year-old policy that bars its ministers from conducting such unions, under penalties that include the loss of ministerial credentials.</p>
        <p>The intensity of the controversy within religious organizations over these issues reflects a larger debate in society over gay rights, a debate in which major institutions have taken different tacks. Earlier this year, the Vermont Legislature voted to extend  legal recognition to civil unions between same-sex couples, breaking decisively with a trend in which many states have taken a nearly opposite approach, passing ''defense of marriage'' laws that carefully define a legal marriage as a contract between a man and a woman.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Presbyterians with a more conservative outlook have tended to have the upper hand in the church. Three years ago, they succeeded in passing an amendment that forbids the church from ordaining noncelibate gays as ministers, elders or deacons. An effort by that measure's opponents to soften its language failed in 1998.</p>
        <p>But more liberal Presbyterians said they had not given up. Mitzi Henderson, an elder who serves as co-moderator of More Light Presbyterians, an organization that supports gay rights, said, ''I don't think it's the end of the struggle.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 11, 2000, Tuesday  An article in some copies on July 2 about a vote by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) in favor of an amendment to the church constitution to bar ministers from officiating at same-sex unions misstated the purpose of an amendment ratified by the church in 1997. The 1997 amendment prohibits the ordination of anyone who is sexually active outside marriage, not just noncelibate gays and lesbians.</p>
