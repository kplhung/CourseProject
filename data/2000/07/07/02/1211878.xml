        <p>IT was a Supreme Court term of surpassing interest, rich in symbol and substance, a vivid reminder of the court's power to scramble settled expectations, put old questions to rest and, ultimately, to have the last word.</p>
        <p>The justices stood by some precedents and repudiated others. They invalidated four federal laws, continuing on the path of subjecting the exercise of congressional authority to close and skeptical scrutiny.</p>
        <p>During the term that began last Oct. 4 and ended June 28, the court decided only 73 cases, the fewest number of any term since the early 1950's. Although small, the docket ranged over almost the entire constitutional landscape. The First Amendment alone, with its provisions governing association, religion and free speech, injected the justices into state electoral systems, high school football games and sexually explicit cable television programming.</p>
        <p>In addition, some of the court's most important rulings were statutory: the invalidation of the Food and Drug Administration's regulation of tobacco and a decision keeping many medical malpractice cases against health maintenance organizations out of federal court.</p>
        <p>The H.M.O. decision was unanimous, as were more than a third of the court's rulings. But the court was more sharply divided than usual, with the middle ground often seeming to disappear. Twenty cases were decided by 5 to 4 votes, a higher propotion than in most recent years. A solid conservative bloc consisting of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas hung together and prevailed in 13 of the 20.</p>
        <p>The four more liberal justices -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- voted as a group in the majority in only one 5-to-4 case, the decision striking down Nebraska's abortion law, where they were joined by Justice O'Connor. The six remaining close cases were scrambled: for example, in the case striking down a federal regulation on sexually explicit programming on cable television, Justice Thomas, who often displays a libertarian bent on free speech issues, and Justice Kennedy, who almost always adopts the free speech position, were in the majority to strike down the regulation, while Justice Breyer, often sympathetic to government interests in speech cases, voted in dissent.</p>
        <p>At the center of the court this term were Justice O'Connor, who cast only five dissenting votes; Chief Justice Rehnquist, who cast eight; and Justice Kennedy, who dissented nine times. Chief Justice Rehnquist's position at the center of the court is itself a measure of how conservative the court has become; Associate Justice Rehnquist had been the court's most frequent lone dissenter when President Reagan chose him 14 years ago to succeed Chief Justice Warren E. Burger.</p>
        <p>Now, for example, on criminal law, Chief Justice Rehnquist's vote is a fair indicator of the court's center of gravity. To his right, Justice Scalia, who dissented 15 times this term, and Justice Thomas, who dissented 12 times, were the two dissenters from the chief justice's decision that reaffirmed the Miranda ruling. To the chief justice's left, Justice Stevens dissented 28 times and Justice Ginsburg 23, on cases ranging from equal protection to congressional authority to prisoners' rights.</p>
        <p>Yet the labels conservative and liberal do not fully capture this court. ''Which cases were most visible to the public this year?'' John G. Roberts Jr., a Supreme Court practitioner and and former deputy solicitor general during the Bush administration, asked rhetorically the other day. ''Probably school prayer, abortion, and Miranda, and the conservatives lost all three,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''The conventional wisdom needs to be taken skeptically.''</p>
        <p>The key to this court's mysteries may lie in examining where the justices commit their energy. Questions of individual rights, such as race and due process, are not the front-burner issues at the court that they were a few years ago, perhaps because the justices have reached a kind of settlement: affirmative action has been sharply limited, while at the same time the due process guarantee is alive and well.</p>
        <p>Instead, what animates the justices are questions of the court's own institutional turf in particular and the allocation of governmental power in general, both among the branches of the federal government and between Washington and the states.</p>
        <p>''The court is reflecting in a bunch of different doctrines the general sense that the federal government is too big, too powerful, too incompetent,'' said Professor Christopher H. Schroeder of Duke University Law School. Cases this year in which the court struck down state incursions into the federal government's authority in foreign affairs were not the contrary, he said, reflecting instead ''the classic 18th-century notion that where we need the federal government, we need it internationally.''</p>
        <p>The lines in the court's federalism debate have been clearly drawn, with the open question being where the court plans to take it next. One logical path, Professor Schroeder said, would be in the libertarian direction of giving individual citizens more ammunition against government authority through strengthening the Fifth Amendment doctrine against the uncompensated ''taking'' of private property, for example. But Justice Scalia has pushed the takings argument as far as his current colleagues seem willing to follow, trying but not quite succeeding in making much land-use regulation constitutionally questionable as a ''regulatory taking'' for which landowners must be compensated.</p>
        <p>So, like questions that this election-year term has raised about the court's future, this is one that does not have a clear answer. Even a casual look at the term's 5-to-4 decisions shows what could lie ahead, depending on which president gets to fill which vacancies, if any. The four liberal dissenters from the decisions curbing federal authority would move quickly to overturn those precedents if they gained another vote, while at the same time, Justice Thomas and three other conservative justices -- minus Justice O'Connor -- who came up one vote short of dramatically lowering the barrier to public aid to parochial schools would not hesitate to move quickly in that direction. To that degree, the term that ended last week is as much prologue as last word.</p>
        <p>Following are summaries of the term's most important decisions.</p>
        <p>Abortion</p>
        <p>The court ruled that because the procedure that abortion opponents call partial-birth abortion may be the most medically appropriate way of terminating some pregnancies, it cannot constitutionally be banned. The 5-to-4 decision, Stenberg v. Carhart, No. 99-830, invalidated a Nebraska law while rendering the laws of 30 other states unconstitutional as well. Justice Breyer wrote the majority opinion; the dissenters were Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justices Scalia and Thomas and, surprisingly in light of his earlier support for abortion rights, Justice Kennedy.</p>
        <p>By a 6-to-3 vote, the court ruled that a Colorado law creating a ''no-approach'' zone outside medical offices did not violate the free speech rights of abortion protesters seeking to urge women not to go through with their abortions. Justice Stevens wrote the opinion in Hill v. Colorado, No. 98-1856. Justices Scalia, Thomas and Kennedy dissented.</p>
        <p>Federalism</p>
        <p>By the 5-to-4 vote that has become familiar from the court's increasingly bitter debate over the proper allocation of federal and state authority, the court struck down a central provision of one federal law, the Violence Against Women Act, and invalidated the application of the federal age discrimination law to the states.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, when the justices saw a case as presenting a straightforward issue of the supremacy of federal law -- as opposed to a federal incursion into a traditional area of state authority -- the court was most often unanimous in upholding the federal law.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion in the Violence Against Women Act case, United States v. Morrison, No. 99-5, declared that ''the Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.'' The decision invalidated the law's civil damages provision, which permitted suits in federal court by victims of crimes ''motivated by gender.''  The dissenters were Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.</p>
        <p>By the same 5-to-4 lineup, the court ruled in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, No. 98-791, that Congress lacked authority to make the states, as employers, liable to suit under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Writing for the majority, Justice O'Connor said the government's interest in eradicating age discrimination on the job yielded to the states' sovereign immunity.</p>
        <p>In another case involving state immunity, the court avoided the Constitution and looked only to Congress's intent in ruling that Congress did not mean to make states liable to suit under the False Claims Act for defrauding the federal government. Justice Scalia wrote the opinion in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. Stevens, No. 98-1828, with Justices Stevens and Souter dissenting.</p>
        <p>In a unanimous decision, the court rejected a states' rights challenge to the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, a federal law that bars states from selling personal information about licensed drives and automobile owners. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion in Reno v. Condon, No. 98-1464.</p>
        <p>The court was also unanimous in upholding the supremacy of federal law in two cases with foreign policy implications. In one, Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, No. 99-474, an opinion by Justice Souter held that a federal law placing sanctions on Myanmar, the former Burma, pre-empted a Massachusetts law that withheld state business from companies that do business with that nation's repressive military regime.</p>
        <p>In the second case, the court invalidated Washington State's safety and environmental regulations for tanker traffic along its coast. Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion in United States v. Locke, No. 98-1701.</p>
        <p>Due Process</p>
        <p>In a case about the right of parents to resist interference in their children's lives from grandparents and others, the court ruled 6 to 3 that a Washington State law went too far in permitting a judge to order grandparents' visiting rights over a mother's objection. The splintered opinions in Troxel v. Granville, No. 99-138, invoked the Constitution's due process protection for parental child-rearing decisions, but failed to agree on a definitive approach. Justice O'Connor wrote a plurality opinion that Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Breyer and Ginsburg joined. Justices Souter and Thomas provided additional votes on the parents' side. Justices Kennedy, Stevens and Scalia dissented.</p>
        <p>Criminal Law</p>
        <p>The court's 7-to-2 reaffirmation of Miranda v. Arizona, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, was the leading criminal law case. The court said in Dickerson v. United States, No. 99-5525, that because Miranda ''announced a constitutional rule,'' Congress was not free to replace the famous Miranda warnings with a case-by-case test of whether a confession was voluntary. The decision invalidated a 1968 law, known as Section 3501, by which Congress had purported to overrule Miranda. Justices Scalia and Thomas dissented.</p>
        <p>The court struck down New Jersey's hate crime law, ruling 5 to 4 that the Constitution requires the jury to make the central finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, of whether a crime was motivated by bias. The New Jersey law left this job to the judge. The decision, Apprendi v. New Jersey, No. 99-478, cast doubt on federal and state laws in which judges make the crucial findings that determine sentences. Justice Stevens wrote the majority opinion; the dissenters were Justices O'Connor, Breyer and Kennedy, along with Chief Justice Rehnquist.</p>
        <p>The court's other criminal law cases were a mix of search-and-seizure issues and cases interpreting a 1996 law restricting state inmates' access to federal court. The outcome was mixed as well.</p>
        <p>The court ruled, 5 to 4, that flight at the mere sight of a police officer can often -- although not always -- be suspicious enough to justify the police in conducting a stop-and-frisk search. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the majority in Illinois v. Wardlow, No. 98-1036, upholding the search of a man who bolted from the sight of police cars converging on a Chicago street. Justice Stevens dissented, joined by Justices Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.</p>
        <p>Criminal defendants prevailed in two other search cases. Justice Ginsburg wrote for a unanimous court that an anonymous tip that a person is carrying a gun is not enough to justify a stop-and-frisk search in the absence of some indication that the information is reliable. The case was Florida v. J.L., No. 98-1993. And the court ruled 7 to 2 that, without some particular suspicion of wrongdoing, law enforcement agents cannot walk down the aisle of a bus squeezing passengers' overhead carry-on bags to see if any might contain contraband. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, in Bond v. U.S., No. 98-9349, while Justices Breyer and Scalia dissented.</p>
        <p>In interpreting the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, a 1996 law in which Congress limited the rights of state inmates to challenge their convictions in federal court by means of petitions for writs of habeas corpus, the court made clear that federal judges still have an important role to play despite the new law's limitations. Applying the new law, the court overturned death sentences in two cases.</p>
        <p>In the first, the court was unanimous in ruling that a Virginia death row inmate, Michael Williams, should not have been penalized by the state's failure to provide needed evidence. Justice Kennedy wrote for the court in Williams v. Taylor, No. 99-6615.</p>
        <p>A second ruling under the 1996 law, also confusingly called Williams v. Taylor, No. 98-8384, was more convoluted, producing two controlling opinions. First, the court interpreted a provision barring federal courts from setting aside a state court decision unless the state ruling was an ''unreasonable'' application of federal law. The question was the meaning of ''unreasonable.''</p>
        <p>Just because a decision was wrong did not make it necessarily unreasonable, Justice O'Connor wrote in a 5-to-4 portion of the ruling that was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Kennedy, Scalia and Thomas. In dissent, Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer said federal judges should not have to defer to state court decisions they regarded as incorrect, even if plausible.</p>
        <p>But by a 6-to-3 vote, in a portion of the opinion by Justice Stevens, the court then granted relief to the inmate in this case, Terry Williams, on the ground that he had not received effective assistance of counsel. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Thomas and Scalia dissented.</p>
        <p>In an 8-to-1 decision, the court ruled that documents produced in response to a broad subpoena under a grant of immunity cannot be used as evidence if the prosecutor did not previously know of the documents' existence. The case, United States v. Hubbell, No. 99-166, grew out of Kenneth W. Starr's prosecution of Webster L. Hubbell, the former associate attorney general, on tax evasion charges. In an opinion by Justice Stevens, the court ruled that Mr. Hubbell's production of thousands of personal financial records was a ''testimonial act'' that was shielded by his immunity agreement. Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented.</p>
        <p>First Amendment: Free Speech</p>
        <p>In an important campaign finance case, the court voted 6 to 3 to reaffirm the constitutionality of low limits on campaign contributions and rejected the argument that such limits can be valid only if aimed at documented instances of corruption. The case, Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, No. 98-963, was from Missouri, where a $1,000 contribution limit mirrors that of federal campaign law. Justice Souter wrote the opinion, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and by Justices O'Connor, Breyer, Ginsburg and Stevens. Justices Kennedy, Scalia and Thomas dissented. Several justices, although not a majority, wrote separately to suggest that beyond this case, the court's entire approach to campaign finance might have to be reconsidered in the future.</p>
        <p>The court ruled unanimously that public universities can collect student activity fees even from students who object to particular activities, as long as the policy is neutral as to the student organizations' viewpoints. Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion in Board of Regents v. Southworth, No. 98-1189, a case from the University of Wisconsin that was followed closely throughout the higher education world.</p>
        <p>Sexually explicit expression was at issue in two cases. By a 6-to-3 vote, the court upheld a nude dancing ordinance from Erie, Pa., that requires dancers to wear at least pasties and a G-string. Justice O'Connor wrote a plurality opinion for herself, Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Kennedy and Breyer, while Justices Scalia and Thomas voted separately to uphold the ordinance. Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Souter dissented in City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., No. 98-1161.</p>
        <p>In the second case, the court voted 5 to 4 to strike down a federal law that required many cable television systems to limit sexually explicit channels to late-night hours. Justice Kennedy's majority opinion, U.S. v. Playboy Entertainment Group, No. 98-1682, was joined by Justices Stevens, Thomas, Souter and Ginsburg. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Breyer, Scalia and O'Connor dissented.</p>
        <p>First Amendment: Association</p>
        <p>The court ruled by a 5-to-4 vote that the Boy Scouts can ban gay members because opposition to homosexuality is part of the organization's expressive message. Application of New Jersey's anti-discrimination law violated the Boy Scouts' right to freedom of association, Chief Justice Rehnquist said for the court in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, No. 99-699. The dissenters were Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.</p>
        <p>The court struck down California's blanket primary, under which all voters get a single ballot from which they can choose candidates of any party affiliation. The system stripped parties of their right to political association, Justice Scalia said for the 7-to-2 majority in California Democratic Party v. Jones, No. 99-401. Justices Stevens and Ginsburg dissented.</p>
        <p>First Amendment: Religion</p>
        <p>The court ruled 6 to 3 that the practice of organized, student-led prayer at public high school football games amounted to an unconstitutional establishment of religion. Justice Stevens wrote the majority opinion in Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, No. 99-62. The dissenters were Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the court lowered the barriers against public aid to religious schools, upholding a federal program that places computers and other equipment in parochial school classrooms. The vote in Mitchell v. Helms, No. 98-1648, was 6 to 3, but the majority splintered over how far to go. Justice Thomas wrote a plurality opinion for himself, Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Kennedy, with a narrower concurring opinion by Justices O'Connor and Breyer declined to go so far.</p>
        <p>Civil Rights</p>
        <p>In an employment discrimination case, the court ruled unanimously that even in the absence of smoking-gun evidence of discrimination, a plaintiff can prevail by showing that an employer's innocent-sounding explanation for its action was a lie. Justice O'Connor wrote the opinion in Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, No. 99-536.</p>
        <p>The court overturned a provision of Hawaii's constitution under which only descendants of the native Hawaiians can vote in elections for trustees of the state's Office of Hawaiian Affairs. Voting 7 to 2 in Rice v. Cayetano, No. 98-818, the court found the provision to violate the 15th Amendment, which provides that the right to vote shall not be denied on account of race. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion. Justices Stevens and Ginsburg dissented.</p>
        <p>In an important voting rights case, the court ruled by a 5-to-4 vote that the Justice Department must approve districting changes -- even those adopted with a discriminatory purpose -- as long as the changes leave minority voters no worse off than before. Prevention of backsliding is the only test for Justice Department ''preclearance'' under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the court said in Reno v. Bossier Parish, No. 98-405. Justice Scalia wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Thomas. Justice Souter wrote a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer.</p>
        <p>Federal Law and Regulation</p>
        <p>The court ruled 5 to 4 that the Food and Drug Administration never received authority from Congress to regulate tobacco products. The court's interpretation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was a blow to the Clinton administration's anti-smoking policy; the invalidated rules restricted the marketing of cigarettes to children and teenagers. Justice O'Connor wrote the court's opinion in F.D.A. v. Brown &amp; Williamson, No. 98-1152, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas. Justice Breyer dissented, joined by Justices Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg.</p>
        <p>Interpreting the federal law that governs employee health benefits, the court ruled unanimously that the financial incentives that health maintenance organizations give doctors to hold down costs do not amount to a violation of the federal duty to put patients' interests first. The decision, Pegram v. Herdrich, No. 98-1949, handed the patients' rights debate back to Congress. Justice Souter wrote the opinion.</p>
        <p>Voting 5 to 4, the court upheld a provision of a recent federal law, the Prison Litigation Reform Act, that restricts the authority of federal judges to keep in place court orders governing the operation of state and local prison systems. Justice O'Connor wrote the majority opinion in Miller v. French, No. 99-224, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas. Justices Souter, Stevens, Breyer and Ginsburg dissented.</p>
        <p>In an important environmental case, the court upheld the ability of private plaintiffs to invoke so-called citizen suit provisions of federal environmental law and bring lawsuits to stop pollution. Justice Ginsburg wrote the 7-to-2 opinion in Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw, No. 98-822. Justices Scalia and Thomas dissented.</p>
