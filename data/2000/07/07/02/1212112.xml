        <p>THE idea is not new: A resort or restaurant in the Caribbean, where winter is the high season, opens a spot in the Hamptons and sends its chef and staff there for a busy summer. This year's entry is the Cerulean Restaurant, a spin-off of the Cerulean Villa in Anguilla.</p>
        <p>The newcomer makes its home in the 1770 House, a historic inn on Main Street in East Hampton. The dining rooms of the antique-filled inn have had a face lift. The dark wood ceiling beams remain but everything else is airy, light and tropical. Tropical here does not mean plastic palm trees. The look is sleek and sophisticated.</p>

        <p>THE idea is not new: A resort or restaurant in the Caribbean, where winter is the high season, opens a spot in the Hamptons and sends its chef and staff there for a busy summer. This year's entry is the Cerulean Restaurant, a spin-off of the Cerulean Villa in Anguilla.</p>
        <p>The newcomer makes its home in the 1770 House, a historic inn on Main Street in East Hampton. The dining rooms of the antique-filled inn have had a face lift. The dark wood ceiling beams remain but everything else is airy, light and tropical. Tropical here does not mean plastic palm trees. The look is sleek and sophisticated.</p>
        <p>The white walls are dotted with original art and partly covered with a colorful fabric depicting Caribbean women with laden baskets on their heads. Tables are topped with snowy white napery and shallow bowls holding floating candles and flowers. A fireplace filled with flickering candles is a focal point. Tall wicker chairs with comfortable cushioned seats complete the picture.</p>
        <p>The staff is sharp. The servers, in cerulean blue shirts, know the menu, describe dishes accurately and make few mistakes. They also take the time to be friendly.</p>
        <p>The restaurant calls its food tropical-Asian-Caribbean and emphasizes seafood. The menu is small and manageable (five appetizers, six entrees). It is also limited. I loved nearly everything I tasted, but many diners will be hard-pressed to find something they like. Five of the six entrees are fin fish, the last is a beef tenderloin-lobster tail combination. All of the appetizers, with the exception of the soup, are fish or seafood. A person at our table wished aloud for a simple green salad.</p>
        <p>Those caveats aside, the food is wonderful: lightly cooked fish, sweet seafood and just enough Asian and island spins to make it interesting. Tops among the openers is the warm lobster salad, a mound of sauteed fresh soybeans and shiitake mushrooms piled upon arugula and crowned with lobster and balsamic vinaigrette. Also turning heads was the sushi-quality soy-cured tuna mated with black sesame-dotted green beans, segments of orange and a drizzled ginger emulsion.</p>
        <p>Three other successes were rouget escabeche (cold poached fish in a spicy marinade) escorted by fiddlehead ferns and a mango chutney; an offering of cold, sliced, cooked monkfish foie gras with a sour mango relish and a clump of mizuna, and a marinated seafood tasting (scallops ceviche, braised octopus in tomato-lime brine and three small oysters on the half shell with different toppings). A tasty cold soup, pumpkin vichyssoise, came in last only because of the exalted company it kept.</p>
        <p>Cerulean serves the ultimate surf and turf: a flavorful grilled beef tenderloin paired with a sweet Maine lobster tail. A fragile potato galette (a ring of paper-thin fried potato slices), sauteed chanterelles and a Szechuan pepper sauce complete the magic plate. Of the fish, the top pick is the perfectly cooked Chilean sea bass perched on a hash of corn, tiny potato cubes and crab meat, with baby spinach and a warm citrus vinaigrette. Also memorable are the monkfish medallions presented with roasted figs, Swiss chard and a sweet-tangy pepper-Port sauce.</p>
        <p>Desserts are just as special. Each had its champion. Chocolate lovers found the moist chocolate bread pudding with banana ice cream and buttered rum sauce a must. My personal favorite was the ginger panna cotta. The satiny custard sported a grilled mango topper one night, a white peach compote another. The pineapple tatin, a crisp open-faced tart with coconut sorbet and mango sauce, drew sighs of ''wonderful,'' as did the mixed berry shortcake with white chocolate ice cream. The shortcake was really a construction of crisp shortbread cookies and a compote of red and yellow raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and strawberries.</p>
        <p>Cerulean Restaurant  143 Main Street at the 1770 House, East Hampton. (631) 329-5550.</p>
