        <p>What We Don't Know</p>
        <p>about Children</p>
        <p>By Simona Vinci.</p>
        <p>Translated by Minna Proctor.</p>
        <p>155 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $21.</p>
        <p>CHILDREN often appear strange to us, like otherworldly beings sent among adults to shame them through shrewd mimicry. Their inner lives can seem both intricately vast -- the toddler who asks if the air ever sleeps -- and gratingly narrow, as when the same child throws a tantrum, his whole world aflame for the sake of a Popsicle. Do children grasp their own contradictions? How aware are they of their effect on us? Just what goes on in the mind of this alien, the child? And why should we regard children as strange? After all, their world was once ours too.</p>
        <p>Given the title of the Italian writer Simona Vinci's first novel, ''What We Don't Know About Children,'' we might expect her to provide some answers to such questions. Her brief and avidly provocative story tells of a group of children who congregate regularly during a languorous summer vacation for sexual high jinks in an abandoned shed. The five children include three boys -- Mirko, 15; Luca, 14; and Matteo, 10 -- and two 10-year-old girls, Martina and Greta. As adolescents, or nearly so, they should be more apprehensible to us than very young children, but in many ways their twilight state of becoming is even more opaque. Able to throw on persuasive, wise-to-the-world masks, these kids work hard to shield their raw, unformed selves from adults as well as from one another.</p>
        <p>Sullen, peremptory Mirko is the band's charismatic leader; he introduces the others to their dirty clubhouse on the outskirts of a small Italian town, which they soon furnish with discarded mattresses, candles and a tape player. He insists that they all bring their most prized possession to the shed so it can ''become somewhere special to go to, a place that was part of them, like their rooms at home.'' But not quite like home; it also becomes ''a place apart, different, with its own laws. A place where the gaze, the authority and also the love of mothers and fathers never entered.''</p>
        <p>This makeshift Neverland serves as an outpost in the distant realm of their own adulthoods because it is here that they begin to learn about sex. Mirko brings them magazines with glossy pages and indelible images: ''The women had triangles between their legs, neatly covered with hair. Below the hair, they opened up like fruit cut in two, split.'' He then choreographs re-enactments of the depicted couplings. Afterward, the children are overwhelmed by sensations of novelty and confusion. Vinci sure-handedly finds her way into a 10-year-old's metaphoric vocabulary to produce a credible comparison: it is ''like when someone comes over to visit and touches all your things, moves your books, listens to your records, sits on your bed . . . and there you are after they've left, alone in your room with the lingering smell of other people's bodies.''</p>
        <p>Ably translated by Minna Proctor, Vinci's prose is rich, if not at times oversaturated, with the sensory immediacy of childhood. The effect is amplified by Vinci's refusal to pull back to a reflective middle distance. By adhering to the perceptual boundaries of early adolescence, she successfully immerses us in memories of our own awkward ages. When we witness the younger children's acquiescence in the face of Mirko's crude threats and manipulations, we readily recall how childhood was a moral free-zone where primal fealties counted for so much more than abstract judgments about conduct. Mirko gets Luca to initiate intercourse with Greta by employing little more than ''a sarcastic look. As if to say, welcome to the amazing, grown-up world'' of sex. While the boy clumsily performs atop the nearly immobile Greta, Matteo and Martina fix their eyes to the screen of a Game Boy. Their moral inattentiveness, at once both appalling and alluring, is instantly recognizable as the core state of adolescent being -- the casual pose draped over feverish incomprehension.</p>
        <p>The claustrophobia of this child's-eye view is most keenly felt in the constriction of the novel's verbal expression. If Vinci has an ear for children's inner thoughts, she has also picked up on their sometimes maddening inarticulateness. Too often she relies on vague expressions to register complex emotional shifts: ''Out of nowhere something changed,'' ''After those magazines it was never the same'' or ''Something was changing.'' Teenagers do talk like this -- It was strange to teach someone else about your own body'' -- but a little goes a long way, even in such a short novel.</p>
        <p>The progression by Mirko and his followers from giggling sex play to intercourse and finally to rape is plainly foreshadowed in the opening pages when we meet Martina and Matteo, who brood like textbook trauma cases. They have witnessed a gruesome, deadly assault, the inadvertent final step in a dance begun by Mirko and a pair of shadowy child pornographers who feed him increasingly violent hard-core magazines to seduce the children into sadomasochistic scenarios. The idyllic scenes of kittenish sex games are predictably perverted by the serpent, the adult.</p>
        <p>INDEED, there is something a bit pat, and certainly calculating, about the whole story. The loss-of-innocence tale is well worn (even this one's saw-toothed sexual violence was predated by more than 30 years in Hubert Selby's ''Last Exit to Brooklyn''). ''What We Don't Know About Children'' created the expected fuss in Italy; in an interview, the author attributed it to the way everything ''concerning children and sex is always treated with malice.'' Considering that her novel graphically describes the anal rape (with a tennis racket) of a little girl, this sounds more than a bit disingenuous.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Vinci recreates the children's consciousness, as well as their tactile reality, with disturbing, often poetic effect. As the friends bury the rape victim's mutilated corpse, one of them wonders about its cuts and bruises: ''Do you think there's enough time for them to turn into scars?'' No adult would ever inquire about such a thing, but kids would -- even kids who have watched impassively as a girl was raped to death. Such are the wild incongruities that make them seem like strangers in our midst. For a little while -- maybe all we could really stand -- Vinci plunges us into their fitful atmosphere. We see as they do, feel as they do. It is a bracing, scary, yet familiar feeling because ultimately what we don't know about children is precisely what we do know about ourselves.</p>
