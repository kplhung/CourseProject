        <p>Never let it be said that the beauty industry won't try to turn the smallest detail into big money. Minutia-market of the moment: the humble eyebrow, which has grown from a chic grooming concern into a booming business. Last month, the Avon Centre Salon &amp; Spa opened Eliza's Eyes, an ''eyebrow boutique'' run by Eliza Petrescu, a brow specialist, that includes three private service areas, a gift shop, a refreshment area and two specially trained ''E-ssociates.''</p>
        <p>Valerie Sarnelle, the owner of the Los Angeles eyebrow salon Valerie Beverly Hills, offers Brow Parties (cocktails, waxing, hors d'oeuvres, tweezing) and recently gave them for Allure and Vanity Fair magazines. The Completely Bare salon on Madison Avenue is offering ''Take a Brow'' classes every Monday, where for $25 customers can have their brows shaped and are taught how to maintain and enhance them. And ''The Eyebrow,'' a new glossy vanity table book from Regan Books, is written by Robyn Cosio (with Cynthia Robins), who owns her own haircutting and eyebrow salon, the Bungalow, in Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>If brows are the fashionable feature, what makes a fashionable brow? ''Think Gene Tierney and Hedy Lamarr eyebrows,'' Ms. Cosio said. ''They had what is now the look of the moment: very glamorous, not skinny, not thick. Brows with a beginning and an ending, that don't just fade off.'' Just like a movie, ''The Big Tweezey''?</p>
