        <p>Those patriotic fireworks displays of light, color and noise may also be explosions of toxic particulates, an environmental magazine reports.</p>
        <p>The Earth Island Journal, a quarterly magazine published by the San Francisco-based Earth Island Institute, says in an article in its summer issue that aerial displays can generate increased levels of airborne arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, copper, zinc and chromium. Citing a Swedish technical journal, the article links airborne chemical particulates to lung cancer and heart attacks.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the most noted study of the effects of fireworks displays on public health was conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency on July 4, 1976, in St. Louis. Taking atmospheric samples near the site where a large fireworks display was held that night, the E.P.A. found that the total concentration of fine particulate matter in the air, post-fireworks, was about twice that of the morning's measurement. The level of arsenic was found to be more than 28 times the level detected 12 hours before, and the level of the toxic element antimony about 200 times the previous level.</p>
        <p>Scientists differ on how to interpret such data. ''It's a threat,'' said Philip K. Hopke, chairman of the chemistry department at Clarkson University and a member of the E.P.A.'s Strategies Advisory Committee. ''For those susceptible, it could be another insult that could really hurt them. It's a real possibility.'' Those susceptible include people with cardiopulmonary illnesses or asthma, and children, whose immune systems may not be able to fight off the effects of short-term exposure to airborne particulates.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, says Jonathan M. Samet, co-author of a report by the Health Effects Institute in Cambridge, Mass., which studied the correlation between microscopic air pollutants and cardiopulmonary-related deaths in 90 American cities, ''we don't really know what the effects are of short-term exposure for these people.''</p>
        <p>Fireworks makers, understandably, strongly object to charges that their products are unsafe. John Steinberg, president of the Pyrotechnics Guild International, said the industry is ''very highly regulated'' and, ''Fireworks made in or imported into the U.S.A. must exclude harmful chemicals.''</p>
