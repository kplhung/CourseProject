        <p>Drifting through the Indonesian archipelago, we rarely committed to a full, Western-style meal. It was hot. The air was heavy and fragrant, and it descended from time to time in little spurts like the cough of an impatient god. Far be it from mere mortals to make long-term commitments. We snacked.</p>
        <p>Sate -- pieces of meat or fish threaded on bamboo skewers, marinated in a mixture of sweet soy with lime, peanut sauce, garlic and sometimes chili pepper and grilled over charcoal -- is the culinary sum of Indonesia's weather, its sensory sophistication, its mystical bent. It was everywhere and never the same.</p>
        <p>There were chicken strips thin as rubber bands, threaded on skewers, mopped with curry paste, coconut milk, fish sauce and lime. There was sate latat: beef and coconut cut so small that it takes its name from the local word for ''fly.'' There was a shrimp sate, a sate made from little balls of minced seafood and a ground lamb sate so huge it required multiple skewers. Every place we paused, there was a grill on the sidewalk, on the back of a bicycle, in the trunk of a battered car, in clay pits by the roadside or in fancy restaurants. Sate allows one to live moment by moment, bite by bite.</p>
        <p>The dishes themselves are not as difficult to recreate as the context. It's not that you need palm trees and jasmine in the air; indolence and a sense of impermanence, however, are crucial to savoring sate. A summer weekend and a campfire come to mind.</p>
        <p>Sate scholars hold Java, Indonesia, as the birthplace of the dish. The same concept -- skewered, marinated and grilled meat or fish -- is central to the cuisines of Thailand, Vietnam, the Arab countries, India and Malaysia (where it is called satay).</p>
        <p>One school holds that Arab spice traders of the 15th century introduced kebabs, along with Islam, to Java. Another believes that traders from India took the idea of skewered meat to Indonesia. No one doubts that it was in Indonesia that the fragrant marinades, dipping sauces and sambals reached their apogee.</p>
        <p>In things sate, the blend of sweet and sour, salty and hot is what differentiates one dish from another. An Indonesian sambal will brighten the most ponderous meat; a rich coconut-milk-and-peanut dipping sauce will turn the leanest fish voluptuous; soy-and-lime is, by turns, dark and bright. With four different skewers and three different dips, the possible permutations can stretch from sunset to blue moon.</p>
        <p>The simplicity of creating a wildly diverse sate universe makes it apt for summer, the season of the senses. By providing a variety of meats and fish, a selection of marinades ranging from sweet to spicy, an array of dipping sauces (which can be made a day ahead) and some white-hot coals, a host allows guests to cook to suit their tastes, their moods, the moment.</p>
        <p>Fiery Chicken Sate  1 1/2 tablespoons dark brown sugar</p>
        <p>1/4 cup panang curry paste (see note)  1 cup unsweetened coconut milk  2 tablespoons fish sauce (see note)  1 teaspoon lime juice  1 1/2 tablespoons ground coriander  1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 24  1/2-inch wide and 4-inch long strips  24 12-inch wooden or bamboo skewers, soaked in hot water for 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>1. In a large nonreactive bowl, whisk together the sugar, curry paste, coconut, fish sauce, lime juice and coriander. Add the chicken and toss until well coated. Transfer the mixture to a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to 12.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat the broiler or grill. Remove the chicken from the marinade and thread each strip onto a skewer. Grill or broil the skewers, turning once, until cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Sate Komo  (Indonesian Beef Sate)  (Adapted from ''The Exotic Kitchens of Indonesia,''  by Copeland Marks)  3 pounds beef round or sirloin, cut into  3/4-inch cubes</p>
        <p>1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk  1 1/4 cups grated coconut  2 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar</p>
        <p>1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce  1 to 2 tablespoons seeded, finely chopped red or green bird chilies (see note)  6 wooden or bamboo skewers, soaked in hot water for 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>1. In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients, mixing well. Set aside at room temperature to marinate for 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat the broiler or a grill. Slide the beef cubes onto the skewers, using 4 to 5 cubes per skewer. Press the beef into the marinade to get as much of the coconut as possible to cling to the meat. Grill, turning once, until browned and cooked to the desired doneness, 3 to 6 minutes per side. Serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Spiced Lobster Sate  3 cooked lobster tails, shelled and split, each tail cut into 6 pieces</p>
        <p>1/4 cup Balinese thousand-spice sauce (see recipe)  6 lemongrass stalks  2 teaspoons vegetable oil  2 red bird chilies, seeded and thinly sliced (see note)  1 clove garlic, finely chopped  1 small shallot, thinly sliced  1 lime, cut into 6 wedges.</p>
        <p>1. In a large bowl, toss the lobster and the sauce until well coated. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.</p>
        <p>2. Cut the tough, thin ends from the lemongrass stalks for use as skewers, and reserve the tender middle portions for another use. Carefully slide 3 lobster pieces onto each lemongrass ''skewer.''</p>
        <p>3. Preheat the broiler or a grill. Broil or grill the lobster, turning once, until browned and just heated through, about 2 1/2 minutes per side.</p>
        <p>4. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, over medium-high heat, heat the oil. Add the chilies, garlic and shallot and cook until lightly browned and soft, about 3 minutes.</p>
        <p>5. Transfer the lobster skewers to a serving platter, top with the chili mixture and surround with the lime wedges. Serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Ninh Hoah (Skewered Vietnamese Meatballs)  1 pound ground pork</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper  3 stalks lemongrass, tough outer leaves discarded and ends trimmed, minced  6 cloves garlic, minced  2 medium shallots, minced  1 tablespoon granulated sugar  2 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch  1 tablespoon fish sauce  6 wooden or bamboo skewers, soaked in hot water for 10 minutes  Lettuce leaves for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. In a medium bowl, mix the pork, pepper, lemongrass, garlic, shallots, sugar, cornstarch and fish sauce. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 12.</p>
        <p>2. Using your hands, divide the meat mixture into 18 equal portions and roll into individual balls. Gently push 3 meatballs onto each skewer.</p>
        <p>3. Preheat the broiler or a grill. Broil or grill the meatballs, turning once, until uniformly brown and crisp, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving platter lined with lettuce and serve with peanut sauce (see recipe) on the side.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 first-course servings.</p>
        <p>Balinese Thousand- Spice Sauce  (Adapted from the Four Seasons Resort Bali AT JIMBARAN BAY)  4 teaspoons vegetable oil  1 large shallot, finely chopped  4 cloves garlic, finely chopped  3-4 red bird chilies, seeded and finely chopped (see note)  2 1/2 tablespoons galangal, peeled and finely chopped (see note)  1 tablespoon kentjur (lesser galangal), peeled and finely chopped (see note)  1 tablespoon fresh turmeric root (see note), peeled and finely chopped, or 1 teaspoon ground dried turmeric</p>
        <p>1/2 tablespoon ground coriander  3 candlenuts or macadamia nuts, ground or finely chopped (see note)  1 tablespoon shrimp paste (see note)</p>
        <p>1/2 tablespoon black peppercorns, cracked</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  2 cloves, crushed</p>
        <p>1/2 cup sweet soy sauce (see note).</p>
        <p>1. In a large skillet, over medium heat, heat the oil. Add all the ingredients except the sweet soy sauce and cook, scraping the bottom of the pan frequently, until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes more.</p>
        <p>2. Transfer the mixture to a blender. Add  3/4cup water and process until smooth. Return the puree to the skillet, place over medium heat and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the soy sauce, lower the heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. If the mixture seems too thick, stir in a few tablespoons cold water.</p>
        <p>3. Strain the mixture in a sieve over a large bowl. Use in the spiced lobster sate (see recipe).</p>
        <p>Yield: About  1/4 cup.</p>
        <p>Lemon-Chili  Green Sauce  (Adapted from Wild Ginger, Seattle )  4 small green bird chilies (see note)  3 to 4 cloves garlic  1 tablespoon cilantro leaves</p>
        <p>1/4 cup lemon juice.</p>
        <p>In a blender, combine all the ingredients and process until smooth. Serve as a dipping sauce with your favorite sate.</p>
        <p>Yield: About  1/2cup.</p>
        <p>Peanut Sauce</p>
        <p>1/2 cup shelled unsalted peanuts  1 tablespoon peanut oil  2 teaspoons red curry paste (see note)  1 teaspoon granulated sugar  1 cup unsweetened coconut milk  2 teaspoons dark soy sauce  1 tablespoon lime juice.</p>
        <p>1. In a food processor, pulse the peanuts until coarsely ground.</p>
        <p>2. In a medium saucepan, over low heat, heat the oil. Add the curry paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in the peanuts, sugar and coconut milk. While whisking constantly, bring to a boil.</p>
        <p>3. Remove from heat and stir in the soy sauce and lime juice. Serve warm with Ninh Hoah (see recipe).</p>
        <p>Yield: About 11/3 cups.</p>
