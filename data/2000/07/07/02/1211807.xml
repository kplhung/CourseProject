        <p>JOSEPH HADDAD, a pediatric ear, nose and throat doctor in Manhattan, said he realized how dropping out of managed care was paying off for him as he sat watching his son's preschool graduation. Dr. Haddad's workload has shrunk markedly -- 20 percent fewer surgical cases, a similar decline in office visits -- since he stopped abiding by the insurers' fee scales last year.</p>
        <p>Now he is home for dinner most nights and can attend his older son's activities. ''You realize how important that is when your kid keeps waving at you the whole time,'' he said, recalling the graduation ceremony. Ditching managed care, he said, ''was really a quality-of-life issue.''</p>
        <p>A number of doctors around the country have taken the same calculated risk in the last few years, by deciding to stop settling for what insurance would pay. They cite low reimbursement rates that forced them to make up revenue in volume, crowding their waiting rooms with patients and rushing their care. The pace and the paperwork stole too much time from their personal lives, the doctors say. And frankly, some just disliked making less money.</p>
        <p>Most of these rebel doctors practice in cities where there are plenty of affluent patients who can pay cash or who have access to old-fashioned indemnity insurance that simply reimburses the patient for most of the bill. Doctors in suburbs where managed care has all but cornered the health insurance market have less scope to drop out.</p>
        <p>Barney Softness, a pediatrician on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, decided last year to tell his managed-care patients -- who made up about one-third of his busy practice -- that he would no longer accept their insurance. Half left immediately, and he finished the year on a sour financial note. But he was happy.</p>
        <p>''A great benefit was, it was much quieter,'' Dr. Softness said. He and his partners were able to reduce the number of patients each saw in an hour to just four, from five or six under managed care. ''We had time to do it right,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Then something happened: The lost patients started coming back. ''Some said, 'It is worth it to us,' ''  Dr. Softness said, ''the implication being that they were getting mill-like treatment.'' Now, he said, ''we are back to being as busy as we were.'' If it gets too busy, he said, he may have to stop accepting new patients.</p>
        <p>As it happens, I have firsthand experience of the changes in Dr. Softness's practice: My own baby has been seen by his partners since shortly after they dropped the plans. Care was great, service speedy at first; lately, I've been kept waiting from 10 to 40 minutes, though once we get into an examination room, I still feel that my child is the only one the doctor is seeing that day. I'm a loyal fan.</p>
        <p>And yet, my own primary-care doctor, who accepts many insurance plans, never makes me wait, and never rushes me either.</p>
        <p>In fact, few patients feel that their doctors neglect their care as a result of insurance company pressures, according to a new survey by the Center for Studying Health System Change, an independent research organization in Washington. The study, based on interviews with 59,000 Americans, found that while 44 percent thought that the companies do influence doctors' care decisions,  only 7 percent said they believed doctors put insurers' interests ahead of patients' needs. The center got similar results in 1997, before the backlash against managed care had gathered steam.</p>
        <p>The response may mean that patients are simply not aware of how stressed-out their doctors are. Or it may signal that patients do not agree with their doctors' view that quality erodes as revenues rise. Even if they do agree, most patients have little choice: few earn enough to afford doctors' fees on their own, and doctors say they have had to turn away patients for financial reasons. ''There are a lot of interesting cases that I might want to do, but can't, because the families are constrained by their choice of insurance,'' Dr. Haddad said.</p>
        <p>JONATHAN SHELDON, a family doctor in Denver who opened a no-managed-care office after working for a managed-care company in Vermont, said he has found a way around the problem. He charges patients $4 a minute. If he sees them for 10 minutes, they pay $40, which, he said, is cheaper than an office visit at most nearby clinics. ''It is a win-win,'' he said. ''I have patients who are rich and poor, and they come because they love the service.''</p>
        <p>At a clinic, a patient might pay $60 for a 10-minute visit -- or the same for an hour, making it hard to say if Dr. Sheldon's approach really optimizes care and cost for patients.</p>
        <p>Most doctors do not have the chance to test such theories. Peter Shutkin, an internist in New Canaan, Conn., recently decided that he had had enough of Aetna. But while he may fantasize about extending the take-a-hike message to the other four plans he accepts, he knows it's no use. ''Practically, I don't think it would work,'' Dr. Shutkin said. ''I wouldn't have any patients left.''</p>
