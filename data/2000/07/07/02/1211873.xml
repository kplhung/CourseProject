        <p>Human genome is program, set of precisely coded instructions that evolution has written for design, operation and maintenance of a person; genome's programming language, announced at White House ceremony last week, has only four letters, designated A, G, C and T after chemical units of DNA, but these suffice to express instructions for building most complex known object in universe, the human brain (M)</p>

        <p>COMPUTERS are uncaring devices that run on electrons and the cold numbers in their programming. They are hard, boxy things and essentially hateful. People are soft, warm, fuzzy, logic-averse creatures who like to cuddle and are mostly rounder than they want to be. Surely nothing connects two such far distant realms.</p>
        <p>Alas, something does, something that last week was pried out from the obscurity where for four billion years  it has been gradually evolving its present shape.</p>
        <p>Just as surely as any shrink-wrapped Microsoft disk, the human genome is a program, a set of precisely coded instructions that evolution has written for the design, operation and unfortunately rather limited maintenance of a person. That people should be operated by such a specific script is as amazing as it would be to find that robots have souls.</p>
        <p>The genome's programming language has only four letters, designated A, G, C and T after the chemical units of DNA, but these suffice to express the instructions for building the most complex known object in the universe. The human brain is thought to possess about 100 billion nerve cells wired together with 100 trillion interconnections. The connections are so cunningly engineered that some scientists suspect there is not a single miswiring in the entire system.</p>
        <p>How do you go from four letters to the complexity of the brain? That's pretty easy. You just build one layer of complexity on top of another until you have what you need. The four letters spell out 64 three-letter words. The words, in strings of about 300, constitute some 50,000 instructions, a k a genes, and the body's cells, of which the brain has about 1,000 different varieties, each use a special subset of the instructions.</p>
        <p>Can our self-image of fuzzy free spirits long survive when the genome proves that life, at its deepest level, is scripted by a logical program? The program's control is so tight that, as has long been known, a single error in the instructions can cause malfunctions such as sickle-cell anemia and other hereditary diseases.</p>
        <p>Even in matters of behavior, the program can be astonishingly precise. A favorite laboratory animal, the microscopic roundworm known as C. elegans, can be found in soils around the world, peacefully eating bacteria. Some C. elegans colonies are very social and all dine together. In others, solitary feeding is the rule. Biologists at the University of California in San Francisco recently discovered that both social and solitary feeding in the worm are controlled by the same gene. In the 215th word of the gene, the solitary feeders have the letters G-T-T, the social feeders T-T-T. Just as in computer programs, a single letter can make all the difference.</p>
        <p>Because the genome's designer has an absolute lock on the biological software market, the human genome is written in the same programming code as is that of roundworms. But no doubt our behavioral instructions have somewhat more wriggle-room than the worm's because the choices we must make to survive are rather more complicated.</p>
        <p>OVER the next few years we should get to read  those behavioral instructions. Whatever they are -- instincts to slaughter or show mercy, the contexts for love and hatred, the taste for obedience or rebellion -- they are the determinants of human nature.</p>
        <p>''We have caught the first glimpses of our instruction book, previously known only to God,'' Dr. Francis Collins, head of the Human Genome Project, said in announcing its decipherment at a White House ceremony last Monday.</p>
        <p>The Genesis account, to continue Dr. Collins's thought, tells us there were two trees in the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life. God evicted Adam and Eve because he feared that, having tasted the Tree of Knowledge, his problem tenants would eat next of the Tree of Life and live forever.</p>
        <p>The genome, to borrow the Genesis writer's metaphor, is surely represented by both trees, entwined around each other like two strands of a double helix. Have we not now broken back into the garden for a second bite?</p>
        <p>From the Tree of Knowledge we will learn to read the programming instructions that shape human nature and determine the implicit survival rules of human societies. From the Tree of Life we will learn to fix the programming errors that limit longevity and, should we choose, to change the program so as to extend lifespan many decades.</p>
        <p>Linguists trying to reconstruct the language spoken by the ancestral human population have found that the world's major language groups bear strong echoes of the mother tongue's words for ''one'' and maybe ''two,'' but nothing more. Perhaps the first people, like many primitive cultures today, had a counting system that went, ''One, two, many.''</p>
        <p>But now that we have lost our innocence and can count the different degrees of infinity, we can see that that world is constructed of numbers, just as Pythagoras taught, and that beneath the velleities of human nature lies the same powerful programming language whose G-T-T/T-T-T switch determines the sociality of the roundworm.</p>
