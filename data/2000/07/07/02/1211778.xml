        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It was with great pleasure that I read Michele Willens's article ''The Heart Was Their Guide, in Love and the Arts'' [June 11] about the dancer Lorna Burdsall and the filmmaker Estela Bravo. The article came as such a surprise because until now most Cubans, regardless of their talents, who have opted to remain in their country have been ignored or vilified by our media. Ms. Willens has pierced the faceless enemy label that has depersonalized the Cuban people in the eyes of many Americans. This depersonalization has tended to neutralize our natural inclination to object to our government's attempt to starve our Cuban neighbors through almost 40 years of embargo.</p>
        <p>I happen to know both Lorna Burdsall and Estela Bravo, as friends and as artists. How deplorable that two of the outstanding dancers and filmmakers of our time are almost entirely unknown to United States audiences. Every one of Estela Bravo's 26 documentary films has won international awards. These films are known in most other countries of the world.</p>

        <p>Many of us who have seen Cuba with our own eyes, despite the unconstitutional quarantine by our State and Treasury Departments, hope that Ms. Willens's article will help to reestablish mutual respect and normal relations between our people.</p>
