        <p>We discussed the possibilities. Could it be a person named Bibb who sold a small, dark green lettuce with especially tender leaves?

        <p>The waiter asked, ''Would you like a bibb lettuce salad?''</p>
        <p>My lunch guest, Frederic Cassidy of the Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE), nodded yes. Then the great lexicographer looked off into the distance and said, ''I wonder who Bibb was.''</p>
        <p>We discussed the possibilities. Could it be a person named Bibb who sold a small, dark green lettuce with especially tender leaves? Or, not eponymous, the noun could be related to the piece of cloth tied under a child's chin to catch dripping food, which, when topped by lace and tucked under the chin of ladies, is enshrined in the phrase best bib and tucker. Was there some connection to the Latin bibere, ''to drink,'' source of imbibe, ''to absorb fluids,'' which would describe the use of a baby's bib -- and bibulous, ''tipsy,'' which might suggest an alcoholic beverage to wash down a salad? That reminded us to order a glass of wine, and we went on to fresh speculations.</p>
        <p>Cassidy's mind was like that, delightedly examining the origins of words and phrases that most users of the language accept without thinking. He liked archaisms too: ''Let me know if the next volume of DARE doesn't reach you next week, and I shall snib the publisher.'' Was snib, I asked, a variant of snub? ''Sorry -- a Chaucerian word slipped out,'' he replied. ''Means 'to rebuke sharply,' I suppose related to snub in the Scandinavian. Don't you think a word like that deserves revival?''</p>
        <p>The Jamaican-born Cassidy, who died last month at 92 while still hard at work on the final volumes of his great dictionary, never snibbed anybody. Though an intensely purposeful scholar, he was a gentle soul whose love of the dialects and colorful metaphors of the American language was contagious. I have been an unabashed shill (slang origin in ''gambler's decoy,'' now meaning ''pitchman'') for the University of Wisconsin's DARE for nearly two decades because Fred's organized wonderment made me a believer.</p>
        <p>He was the master of the whatdyacallit question, asked by teams of interviewers in the furthest reaches of urban and rural America. This led to an understanding of patterns of usage by region. If you're hungry for a hoagie, you're probably in Pennsylvania or New Jersey; all along the Atlantic Coast, you ask for a sub; if you're in New England, you demand a grinder, in New York a hero, in Louisiana a po' boy and a torpedo all over.</p>
        <p>(In New York City, this can be washed down with a two cents plain, which is straight soda water, also called seltzer and in expensive bars sparkling water; with chocolate syrup added, it becomes a chawklit phosphate, and with milk added to that, an egg cream. DARE is the only dictionary to report authoritatively, from the mouth of a delicatessen owner, that an egg cream contains neither egg nor cream.)</p>
        <p>Whatdyacall those little accumulations of dust under the bed? In the Northeast, it's kitten fur and pussy willows; in the Midwest, it's dust bunnies and dustballs; up toward Illinois, it's goose feathers; and in Pennsylvania, woolies. There are scattered entries for bunny tails, cussywops, fooskies, woozies, house moss and midnight fuzz.</p>
        <p>Cassidy sent his interviewers out to ask pedestrians: What is it you do to save steps by crossing a square diagonally?</p>
        <p>The ''national'' answers were cut across and go kitty-corner. That last has nothing to do with felines; catty-corner and variants catty-bias, catty-cue and catty-godlin are rooted in the French quatre, part of ''four corners.'' Americans in the South and West added the suffix -wampus, which led, said Fred, ''to catawampus and its huge brood: catty-wamp, kitty-wamp, even canky-wampus.''</p>
        <p>In Minnesota, they angle across; Missourians cut cabbages; Texans jayhawg, Marylanders walk bias acrost and North Carolinians take a nigh cut. New Englanders are not likely to understand the Southern antigogglin'. ''The older sense of gogglin' refers to eyes that squint; people who squint don't see things straight. They get things crooked, or antigogglin'.''</p>
        <p>When I looked slaunchwise at him, he looked back at me skewhiffy and allowed himself to philosophize: ''Nobody wants to go straight all the time. To describe the unstraight, everyday things, we seem to feel a need for more lively language. As long as we're going to be crooked or diagonal, why not make it keywampus?''</p>
        <p>The spoken voice was more valuable to him than the written citation. Example: In 1991, as President Bush was about to decide to end pursuit of Saddam Hussein's forces in Iraq, Gen. Colin Powell was asked to call Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf to see if he agreed. An eyewitness, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, reported that Powell used the hotline to Riyadh and told the president, ''Norm says he can handle it.'' Question to the dialect lexicographer: What does I can handle it mean?</p>
        <p>''Print hides the voice,'' said Cassidy. ''One meaning is 'I can control something that needs control.' A quite different meaning, indicated by inflection, is 'This hurts my pride, dignity, sense of what I deserve, but I can accept it and not let my feelings show.' ''Or, as has been noted from the dawn of dialectology, it ain't what you say, it's the way that you say it.</p>
        <p>What next for DARE? Cassidy's baton will be picked up by his longtime top editor, Joan Houston Hall, and philanthropists who want to preserve our cultural heritage should contribute to Cassidy DARE Fund, U. of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis., 53706. Volume IV, letters P to Sm, will be coming out in late 2002. Each volume has cost $75; if your local librarian doesn't have them, look skewhiffy at him.</p>
        <p>And on the subject of lettuce, Fred Cassidy, following his wonderment, would inform you that a leading American horticulturist of the 19th century was Major John Bibb.</p>
