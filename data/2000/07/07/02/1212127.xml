        <p>This summer, Peconic Bay Winery's label for a new wine, rose of merlot, will be designed and placed on bottles, and East Enders will be in for a treat. (The estate's name has shifted under the new owners, Paul and Ursula Lowerre, from Peconic Bay Vineyards.)</p>
        <p>The '99 harvest brought an oversupply of young merlot, said the general manager, Matthew Gillies, and the staff decided to experiment with a rose -- luckily, it turns out.</p>
        <p>Pinkish-salmon in color, the wine (to be priced at perhaps $12), sleek, piquant and upbeat, captures the character of traditional rose; it conveys not actual sweetness but enough fruity heft to carry an impression of sweetness.</p>
        <p>Macari's coral-salmon '99 Rose d'Une Nuit, made from merlot, cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon grapes, has a complex tropical-fruit tilt, perhaps orange-tangerine. The bouquet is meaty, with an almost smoked bacon vein. These features give the wine ($12) an exotic character. A flaw? Maybe. No matter, the result is pleasing, and a triumph of interesting flaw over sterile perfection.</p>
        <p>The dry '99 Wolffer rose ($10) from Sagpond Vineyards in Sagaponack is, as usual, Tavel-like. Why vary the style of a South Fork favorite?</p>
        <p>Watch for the rose at tailgate picnics at the Hamptons Classic horse show. In addition, it is born to accompany Proust at poolside. (It is no criticism of the wine to say the finish in Proust is longer.)</p>
