        <p>A dangerously large number of young people in the developing world do not know how to protect themselves from the virus that causes AIDS, according to a report from Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund.</p>
        <p>Girls are especially ignorant about the disease, Unicef found. A survey of 34 countries found that in about half, more than 50 percent of girls from age 15 to 19 said they did not know that a person with AIDS could appear healthy. In Chad, the figure was 83 percent; in Niger, 81 percent; and in Nepal, 80 percent.</p>

        <p>A dangerously large number of young people in the developing world do not know how to protect themselves from the virus that causes AIDS, according to a report from Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund.</p>
        <p>Girls are especially ignorant about the disease, Unicef found. A survey of 34 countries found that in about half, more than 50 percent of girls from age 15 to 19 said they did not know that a person with AIDS could appear healthy. In Chad, the figure was 83 percent; in Niger, 81 percent; and in Nepal, 80 percent.</p>
        <p>''This knowledge gap is one important element in understanding the higher H.I.V. infection rate among girls in many countries,'' the report said. The survey of what young people know about AIDS is part of Unicef's annual Progress of Nations report, to be published Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Efforts to reach and teach girls are hampered by ''poverty, local customs, violence and social or religious bias,'' Unicef said.</p>
        <p>But even some knowledge of AIDS and how H.I.V. is transmitted does not necessarily change young people's perceptions about their vulnerability or change behavior, the report also found. In Haiti, Zambia and Zimbabwe -- where risks of being infected are high -- the Unicef survey found that more than half of sexually active girls said they did not consider themselves at risk.</p>
        <p>One of the greatest challenges to health services, the report said, ''is how to help young people convert the information they have about H.I.V./ AIDS into personal awareness of risk.''</p>
