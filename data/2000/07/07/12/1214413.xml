      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Writers in general, and novelists in particular, have a notoriously difficult time grasping the basic concept of the vacation. Leaving our desks is not quite the same as stealing a few days away from the office. For one thing, our fictional characters tend to go along with us, like a troupe of unwanted houseguests intruding on our holiday plans. All our obsessions concerning plot, tone and style are not about to lighten up; all the technical problems that bedevil us are not likely to solve themselves just because we announce we're taking a break.</p>
        <p>Like many writers, I can't remember the last time I took a vacation, unless you count (and I don't) those weekends of recuperative hibernation, of nearly uninterrupted catch-up sleep. Even when I travel, I'm usually on assignment, writing a travel piece. Left to my own devices, how would I know where to eat and sleep, what to look at, where to go? For me, more often than not, a true vacation means that I have fled to the country and told almost no one where I'm going. For a week, or even a weekend, I can stay at my desk, actually concentrate and get some writing done. The phone doesn't ring, the mail goes unopened, the complications and commitments of my ordinary life are put on hold. What I consider to be a vacation is having time to work.</p>
