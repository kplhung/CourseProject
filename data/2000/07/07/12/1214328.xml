        <p>Does New York City need lessons in how to redevelop its waterfront? Take a look at what London has done. Does London need guidance in revitalizing old neighborhoods? Have a gander at New York's methods.</p>
        <p>Those themes emerged when the government of the City of London, which is one of 33 boroughs that make up the overall city, decided to study the economies of the two cities with an eye to strengthening London's economic base.</p>
        <p>In the process, the recently completed study turned up some advice for New York. But if the reaction yesterday of one New York City official is typical, that advice may be seen as cautions from a well-meaning cousin who happens to be out of touch.</p>
        <p>As viewed from the City of London, the borough that contains the city's financial district, London and New York are ''without debate the leading global cities in the year 2000,'' and are cities whose economies have arrived ''at an extraordinary point of  symmetry.''</p>
        <p>Among the ''striking parallels,'' according to the 402-page study, made public last month, are the cities' leading roles as centers of finance, culture, communications and tourism. But they also have common problems: long-term declines in older manufacturing industries; growing disparities in incomes; local unemployment rates that, though improving, remain higher than those of their nations'; and difficulties in ''lifting the education and skills levels of residents and immigrants.''</p>
        <p>Those parallels are played out in cities with nearly identical numbers of residents: 7.4 million in New York's 5 boroughs and 7.2 million in London's 33.</p>
        <p>Among the lessons ''London can learn from New York's successes,'' according to the study, is the redevelopment approach used in downtown Manhattan, which has involved rezoning and other policies to stimulate both commercial rejuvenation and residential development.</p>
        <p>London can also benefit from a system like New York's business improvement districts, dozens of which  have proliferated in the city's commercial areas over the last two decades. The districts levy special taxes on property owners in their jurisdictions to pay for sanitation, security and other services and to promote local businesses.</p>
        <p>The districts have attracted so much interest from London that the Central London Partnership, a group of business interests and local government officials, sent a delegation to New York recently to meet with leaders of some districts.</p>
        <p>And the study also urged London's government to look at how New York had encouraged utility companies to participate in programs for supporting small manufacturing companies.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the study says, ''London provides lessons for New York in the extensive redevelopment of its great waterfront, a process which is lagging'' in New York.</p>
        <p>And it urges state and city officials in New York to look at how London has expanded public transportation, including its recent expansion of the  Underground.</p>
        <p>In New York, the study says, little has been done in the last 30 years to expand the capacity of the region's public transportation, though it acknowledges that financing has been proposed for the long-delayed Second Avenue subway and that a rail link is being built to Kennedy Airport.</p>
        <p>Among the study's directors was Rosemary Scanlon, an economic consultant, who served as deputy state comptroller for New York City and  as chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. She took part in the study while she was a visiting research fellow at the London School of Economics.</p>
        <p>Responding yesterday to some of the study's suggestions, Michael G. Carey, president of New York's Economic Development Corporation, took issue with some of the assertions, including that of not doing well on waterfront redevelopment.</p>
        <p>''They're not aware of the different things we're doing,'' he said. He mentioned the park being built along the Hudson River from Battery Park City to 59th Street, plans for a Brooklyn Bridge Park along the Brooklyn waterfront and other plans to revitalize Coney Island and the area around the ferry terminal in St. George, Staten Island.</p>
        <p>''And we reopened Howland Hook,'' he said, referring to a major  Staten Island site for receiving seaborne freight.</p>
