        <p>IF you like exotic things, you can pick up a rare disease on a trip, but what is more likely to spoil your vacation is an injury. Epidemiologists avoid the word ''accident,'' because it sounds like raw fate, a one-ton safe falling 10 stories onto a tourist. They now discuss ''injury prevention.'' It's a good place to start a good vacation.</p>
        <p>In North America, you will probably go by car. The major cause of breakdowns on Interstate 95 in Connecticut, and doubtless other Interstates, is flat tires. Check all tires before you go, the fifth in particular. If possible, drive to the next exit before using the jack: a pedestrian on a highway is an invitation to an acci -- injury, according to the Connecticut safety patrol.</p>

        <p>IF you like exotic things, you can pick up a rare disease on a trip, but what is more likely to spoil your vacation is an injury. Epidemiologists avoid the word ''accident,'' because it sounds like raw fate, a one-ton safe falling 10 stories onto a tourist. They now discuss ''injury prevention.'' It's a good place to start a good vacation.</p>
        <p>In North America, you will probably go by car. The major cause of breakdowns on Interstate 95 in Connecticut, and doubtless other Interstates, is flat tires. Check all tires before you go, the fifth in particular. If possible, drive to the next exit before using the jack: a pedestrian on a highway is an invitation to an acci -- injury, according to the Connecticut safety patrol.</p>
        <p>Owners of cars with 70,000 miles or more should check the manual and have the timing belt replaced.</p>
        <p>Here are more safety tips:</p>
        <p>Motels with interior hallways are generally safer. Try to park where you can see your car. The room's door should have three things: a peephole, a chain or a flop-over hasp and a deadbolt. Use them all. A balcony door should have a bar to keep it shut.</p>
        <p>When you get into a hotel bed, put the room key and a flashlight (the flat little Flashcards do fine) on the bedside table. In an emergency, take both with you, in case you need to get back into the room.</p>
        <p>Learning the Heimlich maneuver is worthwhile, but people who choke in restaurants have usually had too much to drink. Vacations enhance this peril. Slow up on your drinking and chewing, medical experts say.</p>
        <p>Dig out your passport and check the expiration date well ahead of traveling to a foreign country (and remember that Canada and Mexico are foreign countries). If the passport expires in less than six months, it's renewal time. On the Web, check www.travel .state.gov for application forms. Renewal by mail will take 25 days. If your trip is in two weeks, call a regional passport office for an emergency appointment. Take your airline ticket for proof; letters from travel agents cut no mustard.</p>
        <p>''International driver's permit'' is a misnomer: it is really a photograph ID that you can buy at a local AAA Club; it says in nine languages that you have a valid driver license. If you do not have a valid driver license, forget this plan. The permit may help if you are in a remote country and the police stop you: they can learn in their own language what your little card is. The AAA is the authorized agency in the United States to issue permits.</p>
        <p>Take a good map any time you are driving. The Michelin brand is superior (but expensive: $10 to $15 for a road map). Take along a flashlight to read the map. Write down the phone number of the hotel itself, not the hotel's central reservations number.</p>
        <p>If you are one adult going to Mexico but you are taking a child, even your own, expect to be asked at the airline gate for a notarized letter saying you have sole custody, permission for the trip or that the other parent is dead. If you are traveling with someone else's child, take documentation from both parents. No joke; this is an antikidnapping effort.</p>
        <p>For trips to places where medical care may be uncertain, or is two airline connections away, buy good trip insurance when you put a deposit on a tour. Read the caveats before you pay. Forget flight insurance: get a good magazine with the money instead.</p>
        <p>Adventurous trips should be preceded by a visit to a travel medicine clinic; searchable clinic lists are at www.istm.org or www.astmh.org. Clinics will give you prescriptions for malaria prophylaxis if your destination warrants it; more vital, the clinics will boost your tetanus shots.</p>
        <p>On an adventure trip, avoid swimming in fresh water unless you can smell the chlorine from a standing position. Beautiful Lake Malawi, and many oases, are rife with schistosomiasis and other dreadful diseases that everyone, including travel agents, wish would disappear. Salt water is generally better, but if you see something that resembles a sewer outflow, you may want to retreat to a pool.</p>
        <p>If you get into difficulty overseas, the United States consulate should be  called. But neither it nor an embassy will lay out cash for your ticket home or for your bail; nor will either one undertake anything that contravenes the country's laws. If the police said that you were going 120 kilometers in a 100-kilometer zone and did not appear sober, you must cope, honeymoon or not. Look up ''extraterritoriality'' -- local laws prevail. On the other hand, if someone at home has money to wire to you, the consulate will tell you how to arrange it.</p>
        <p>The State Department issues travel warnings and less dire advisories on many countries. You can read them at www.travel .state.gov/warnings.  Perhaps you do a lot of things your mother might disapprove of, so make up your own mind in regard to an endurable level of hazard. When asked to summarize a lifetime of travel counseling, Dr. Hans Lobel, a malaria authority at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta,  replied, ''Take your condoms and buckle your seat belt.''</p>
