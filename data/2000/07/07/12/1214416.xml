        <p>THE good news for those of us who like our history to be entertaining (and who doesn't?) is that a new Flashman book will be appearing in August. It's called ''Flashman and the Tiger'' and, like the 10 volumes of the memoirs of the roguish, womanizing, cowardly Harry Paget Flashman to appear so far, it is written by George MacDonald Fraser, who would have been a first-rate historian if he hadn't decided to be a first-rate historical novelist instead. Mr. Fraser's new book tells three relatively brief episodes from the life of the ''celebrated Victorian soldier, scoundrel, amorist and self-confessed poltroon'' -- including one in which he reluctantly helps to foil an assassination attempt against Franz Josef, emperor of Austria.</p>
        <p>The new Flashman adventure suggests a summer reading program that will provide about one part edification for every two parts diversion. The great thing about the Flashman books is that Mr. Fraser bothers to get his details right, whether he is writing about the Sepoy Mutiny in India, the Crimean War or Custer at the Little Bighorn. His stories are carefully plotted and briskly told, with large casts of offbeat characters, plenty of suspense and a main character, Flashman, who has no illusions about himself.</p>

        <p>The new Flashman adventure suggests a summer reading program that will provide about one part edification for every two parts diversion. The great thing about the Flashman books is that Mr. Fraser bothers to get his details right, whether he is writing about the Sepoy Mutiny in India, the Crimean War or Custer at the Little Bighorn. His stories are carefully plotted and briskly told, with large casts of offbeat characters, plenty of suspense and a main character, Flashman, who has no illusions about himself.</p>
        <p>''They truly believed my heroic reputation, and thought I was the kind of derring-do idiot who'd answer the call of duty and danger like a good 'un, itching to fight the good fight,'' he says in Mr. Fraser's coming volume. One of the many pleasures of the Flashman books is to discover the ways in which that statement is true and untrue at the same time.</p>
        <p>My suggestion would be to pick a historical moment that you would like to read about and start there, since the Flashman adventures do not have to be read in order. My favorites include ''The Flashman Papers,'' the first in the series (published 31 years ago), in which our Victorian soldier and sybarite finds himself caught up in the British-Afghan War of 1842; ''Flashman at the Great Game,'' centering on the Indian mutiny of 1857; ''Flashman and the Mountain of Light,'' which tells you more about the politics of British India than you thought it was possible to know; and ''Flashman and the Dragon,'' set amid the British-French expedition against China during the Qing Dynasty.</p>
        <p>Whichever volumes you read, Flashy's jaundiced, politically incorrect and yet historically respectable accounts of major events will be an irregular, eccentric, Rabelaisian course in 19th-century history. You will learn things and have a lot of fun besides.</p>
