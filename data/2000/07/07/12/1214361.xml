        <p>College admissions officers seem to believe that disregarding SAT scores will make the application process more fair, that elite schools will no longer ''favor the rich'' (Editorial Observer, July 10).

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>College admissions officers seem to believe that disregarding SAT scores will make the application process more fair, that elite schools will no longer ''favor the rich'' (Editorial Observer, July 10). But is there any factor in the college application process that cannot be manipulated by wealthy, overenthusiastic parents?</p>
        <p>Recommendations are often inflated, extracurricular activities exaggerated, application essays edited or even written by teachers or parents. Grades, the one factor nearly every college considers most important, do not clearly illustrate a student's intelligence level or work ethic. Tutoring is omnipresent in many affluent communities.</p>
        <p>With such a large range in quality of high schools and in admissions criteria for colleges, shouldn't there be some sort of objective standard? Until we find a flawless method by which we can measure the intelligence of a high school student, the SAT remains the next best thing.</p>
