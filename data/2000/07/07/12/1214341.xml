        <p>CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN always likes being one of the guys.</p>
        <p>An unreconstructed tomboy, she seems unable to resist a mountain bike, a ski slope or basketball with her bodyguards. As New Jersey governor, she's driven a snowplow, flown in a fighter jet and performed at a rodeo. One former aide remembers a staffer suggesting that she hang by ropes from a window at the top of the State House to examine the sorry condition of the gold dome.</p>
        <p>''You could see her eyes light up,'' the former aide said. ''She gets caught up doing these things.''</p>
        <p>So four years ago, while riding late at night with state troopers fighting rampant crime in Camden, she jumped at the chance to frisk a real, live crime suspect. The troopers stopped the man and, after determining he was unarmed, offered him to the governor for a rare bit of executive privilege. A trooper snapped a picture of the governor flashing a toothy grin with her gloved hands on the young black man's torso.</p>
        <p>The picture leaked out a few days ago and now, this particular episode of Outward Bound in the Garden State has turned as precarious as rappelling down the State House dome without a net.</p>
        <p>Here is a governor whose tenure has been substantially defined by the issue of racial profiling, performing an unnecessary -- and perhaps illegal -- search of a black man who, by the way, was accused of no crime.</p>
        <p>In a news conference here yesterday, the governor expressed anger at those expressing anger at her actions. She said she regretted there was a picture floating around that some were ''taking out of context'' to detract from the crime-fighting accomplishments in Camden.</p>
        <p>She said that she should have thought twice when offered the chance to frisk the man but that the picture ''has no meaning'' in the racial profiling debate and offered no apology.</p>
        <p>The way the governor described it, the frisk was something out of the toddler's classic ''Pat The Bunny.'' The governor's version would read: ''The trooper can pat the suspect. Now YOU pat the suspect.''</p>
        <p>What she said yesterday was, ''At one point, one of the troopers asked me if I wanted to do a pat-down, and I said fine.''</p>
        <p>But the grainy photograph is a perfect image of the tension between minority residents and law enforcement. The crime that Mrs. Whitman sent the state troopers to combat was real, but the young black man became a prop in a show of police force. Too often during a police roundup on the street, young minority men ''no longer are people,'' said State Senator Wayne Bryant, Democrat of Camden. ''There is nothing that allows you to search him twice just for your own glory.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman seemed offended yesterday that she was being dragged back into the cauldron of racial profiling. It became a dominant issue in April 1998 when troopers shot and wounded three unarmed minority men during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike.</p>
        <p>Faced with a federal investigation and the findings of her attorney general, Mrs. Whitman acknowledged last year that the state police had discriminated against minority drivers and had also subjected its own minority employees to racial discrimination and sexual harassment.</p>
        <p>The governor demanded the resignation of the state police superintendent for comments she deemed racially insensitive and replaced him with the first black man to head the force.</p>
        <p>Her tackling of racial profiling (albeit just before it tackled her), coupled with her tax cuts and support of some abortion rights, has given her a prominent perch as a moderate Republican.</p>
        <p>She is expected to play a visible role at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, including welcoming delegates at a Camden event. Her supporters give her long-shot prospects as a running mate with George W. Bush and better odds for a cabinet or ambassadorial appointment in a Bush administration.</p>
        <p>As a wealthy, white Republican from New Jersey's horse country, Mrs. Whitman has always been regarded warily by many minority leaders. She polled well among minority voters in her first race for governor in 1993. Her campaign manager, Ed Rollins, later boasted  of paying black clergymen to suppress the black vote -- a claim the governor denied and Mr. Rollins later recanted.</p>
        <p>She was also criticized by minority leaders for appearing regularly on the radio show of Bob Grant -- a conservative whom she later denounced -- and for saying that young black men fathered children out of wedlock as part of a competition she said was called ''jewels in the crown.''</p>
        <p>''It's been a learning process,'' said the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, director of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey, ''and I guess she's still learning.''</p>
