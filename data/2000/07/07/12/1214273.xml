        <p>Sitting on the grass weeping, Tima Mehmedovic pointed to the spot where she had last seen her husband. Five years ago to the day, he was among thousands of men from Srebrenica who were taken away by Serbian forces and killed in probably the worst massacre of civilians Europe has witnessed since World War II.</p>
        <p>Today she was among thousands of Muslim women and a few dozen men, relatives of the dead or those still missing, who returned to the site for a memorial service. They came in fleets of buses, under heavy police protection. Many of them, like Mrs. Mehmedovic, were returning to their hometown for the first time since 1995, when at the height of the war in Bosnia they were separated from the men, herded on to buses and trucks and deported.</p>
        <p>More than 3,500 people attended today's prayer service in the compound of a vacant battery factory, women in traditional head-scarves and baggy pants mingling with Western diplomats and United Nations officials. Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian Muslim leader, also attended, the first high level Bosnian official to visit the scene since the war.</p>
        <p>Srebrenica represents the darkest days of the war not only for the Bosnian Muslims, but also for the United Nations and its troops, whose task had been to safeguard the town,  but who failed in the face of the Serbian onslaught. In recognition of that failure, the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, sent a message to the people of Srebrenica today expressing his remorse.</p>
        <p>For the Serbs now living in the area, the subject is explosive and the ceremony was an unwelcome reminder of the world's opprobrium for the massacre. Srebrenica is now populated only by Serbs and lies in the Serbian entity within Bosnia, where few Muslims have dared return since the war.</p>
        <p>Townspeople stood on corners to watch the buses go by and a few young men made gestures, whistled and jeered. ''They want to blame the Serbs for everything and want the world to think the Serbs are bad,'' said Stevo Lazarevic, a car factory worker who stood with a group of Serbs watching the buses arrive.</p>
        <p>But the day passed without any violence. ''We came here not to take revenge, not to forgive,'' said Mustafa Ceric, the chief Muslim cleric in Bosnia, as he led the prayers. ''We are here to let the world know that we will not abandon our request for justice.''</p>
        <p>For Mrs. Mehmedovic, a mother of three, it was both frightening and painful. ''I don't know what I feel, but it's very hard,'' she said, twisting a handkerchief in her hands. ''I will never forget this place, but I am afraid of going crazy,'' she said, looking around tearfully.</p>
        <p>In 1995, she had sought refuge in the factory compound with her husband and grown son, along with about 20,000 others, hoping that the 450 Dutch troops stationed here would ensure their protection. After two days in the compound, a Serbian soldier allowed her and her son to get on a truck and leave as her husband was held back.</p>
        <p>''I last saw him standing on the asphalt road there,'' she said, pointing to the entrance to the compound. ''I do not know what happened to him. We never found him. We do not know anything.''</p>
        <p>Thousands of men disappeared during those few days. Hundreds were separated from their wives and children in front of Dutch troops at the compound and were hauled off and executed. Thousands tried to escape through the wooded hills and make the long trek to Bosnian-controlled territory. Only a few made it; the vast majority were killed or captured and then shot in mass executions.</p>
        <p>Those buried in mass graves in the area were moved and reburied in some cases. Many of the men who died in the hills have never been found.</p>
        <p>War crimes investigators have found and exhumed more than 4,000 bodies from sites in the area but have been able to identify only 80, according to Kathryne Bomberger of the International Commission on Missing Persons.</p>
        <p>''This day is shameful for the international community,'' said Kadira Jusic, a neighbor of Mrs. Mehmedovic, sitting beside her on the grass. ''Why did they let them kill us? They were innocent people, all of them who died. And it's shameful that five years later we cannot find their bodies,'' she said, her voice sharp, her eyes brimming with tears.</p>
        <p>Reconciliation between Serbs and Muslims remains far off and plans for refugees to return home remain just that. Only three Muslims have returned to live in Srebrenica, which is filled with Serbian refugees from other areas, and they face a precarious existence. Serbs have set fire to at least four houses in the last month, targeting those being prepared for returning Muslims. Just hours before today's ceremony another house was ablaze, that of an old Muslim woman who had been planning to return home in two weeks.</p>
        <p>Hajrudin Nalic, 45, is one of the three Muslims who have returned. He reclaimed his flat in May and keeps a low profile, drinking coffee with the neighbors he knew from before but not mixing with the newcomers. ''The first night I was very scared, but I have not been threatened,'' he said. He has painted the flat and is planning to bring his wife and two daughters to join him. ''Everyone has to go back to their homes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Unemployed and struggling to pay rent in Tuzla, he had decided to try to come back and reclaim the cafe he used to run in Srebrenica. Yet a month ago, the cafe was looted, then  demolished, brick by brick. ''I do not take it as a message to leave but I am not sure if I can manage now,'' he said sadly. ''But I am going to try. That's why I came.''</p>
