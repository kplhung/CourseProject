        <p>FOR almost three years, Sue Torres was the chef at Rocking Horse Cafe Mexicano in Chelsea, a showcase for the possibilities of Mexican food beyond the tyranny of nachos, burritos and refried beans. When she left Rocking Horse to become the chef at Hell's Kitchen, which opened several months ago in Clinton, I couldn't help wondering which direction her cooking would take next.</p>
        <p>The answer is that she's moved in several directions at once, all of which make Hell's Kitchen unusual and appealing yet ultimately hard to pin down. She has continued her creative use of Mexican flavorings and cooking techniques, added ingredients and dishes from the global palette of contemporary American cooking, and also included a few throw-ins to satisfy a neighborhood clientele that may not be interested in experimenting.</p>

        <p>FOR almost three years, Sue Torres was the chef at Rocking Horse Cafe Mexicano in Chelsea, a showcase for the possibilities of Mexican food beyond the tyranny of nachos, burritos and refried beans. When she left Rocking Horse to become the chef at Hell's Kitchen, which opened several months ago in Clinton, I couldn't help wondering which direction her cooking would take next.</p>
        <p>The answer is that she's moved in several directions at once, all of which make Hell's Kitchen unusual and appealing yet ultimately hard to pin down. She has continued her creative use of Mexican flavorings and cooking techniques, added ingredients and dishes from the global palette of contemporary American cooking, and also included a few throw-ins to satisfy a neighborhood clientele that may not be interested in experimenting.</p>
        <p>This last group will be happy with fried calamari ($8) -- they can skip the ancho chili dipping sauce -- and the beefy sirloin steak ($18) served with shallot confit and a sweet potato gratin. But if you're interested in what Ms. Torres can do when she's inspired, head directly for the interpretations of Mexican dishes.</p>
        <p>Her appetizer of tuna tostadas ($8) is brilliant. The small rounds of fresh fish are imbued with coriander and seared, then planted on crisp corn tortillas with guacamole and pineapple, a combination that melds effortlessly. In another appetizer, shreds of rich duck confit are encased in a flaky corn pastry, creating little empanadas ($8) that go beautifully with a sweet mole sauce made with figs. Ms. Torres extracts maximum flavor from a tortilla roll of chayote and portobello mushroom ($6), served with a smoky chipotle sauce, and I very much liked a cold peach soup ($6), thickened with a little yogurt and served with just a hint of chili.</p>
        <p>Ms. Torres devotes part of her menu to quesadillas, house-made flour tortillas layered with cheese and other fillings. In size, they are like small main courses; in spirit, they succeed because they retain their clear Mexican identity even with creative enhancements.</p>
        <p>I loved a quesadilla made with artichokes, mushrooms, fennel and Idiazabal ($14), a smoked Spanish sheep's milk cheese that was a wonderful foil for the fennel. I also liked a quesadilla of earthy chili-rubbed lamb, watercress and Manchego.</p>
        <p>The great potential shown in her appetizers and quesadillas unfortunately fades with the main courses. The best is a grilled pork loin ($16) flavored with chili and set over steamed corn and pineapple, but I didn't know what to make of shrimp served with coconut rice and lemon-grass broth ($17), except that it was way too sweet. Black bass bouillabaisse ($17) lacked the anise jolt that should have come from avocado leaves, the Mexican equivalent of a shot of Pernod. A poblano relleno ($14), stuffed with mushrooms, potatoes and other vegetables, had a nice, spicy bite, but seared tuna with black corn truffle sauce ($17) was strangely unflavorful.</p>
        <p>In atmosphere, Hell's Kitchen is international, with music that is more Cuban than Mexican, waiters who won't have to travel far if they pass their auditions, and fascinating chandeliers made of old wine bottles. There is a small wine list, with some good choices like a tangy New Zealand sauvignon blanc from Glazebrook ($24). Incidentally, the loud music and hopping bar suggest that ordinary conversations will be difficult, but once you sit down the acoustics are surprisingly good.</p>
        <p>After the main courses, desserts ($6 each) rebound to another high. Sorbets are wonderfully intense, made of different fruits each night and served over fruit with a surprising touch of chili. Other good choices include a fabulous coconut flan, a dense bittersweet chocolate terrine and a sweet banana empanada.</p>
        <p>After desserts like these, I certainly left Hell's Kitchen on a happy note. Yet, looking back, I couldn't help feeling a little let down. If only those main courses could live up to the rest of the meal, Hell's Kitchen would be an unalloyed pleasure.</p>
