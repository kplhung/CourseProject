        <p>Luis H. Alvarez stopped eating for 40 days to protest electoral fraud. Sergio Aguayo endured death threats for organizing election observers. Homero Aridjis, a prominent poet was ostracized by official literary circles for exposing government failures on the environment.</p>
        <p>To them, the July 2 presidential vote, which ousted a seven-decade-old regime and elected an opposition leader, Vicente Fox Quesada, as president, was not just an election but another Mexican revolution.</p>
        <p>It was the end of decades of lucha, or struggle, the dreamy but stubborn pursuit of an ideal. In different ways, all kinds of Mexicans came to believe that the omnipotent Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, could one day be toppled by the ballot.</p>
        <p>''Mexican democracy does not have one father or mother, it has thousands,'' said Mr. Aguayo, an elections monitor. ''We each decided, with our own intensity, to say no to submitting to the system.''</p>
        <p>The democracy movement was jolted to life after 1968 when President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz sent army troops to fire on a Mexico City student demonstration, killing dozens. It surged again after 1988, when Carlos Salinas de Gortari became president in a vote that most Mexicans believe was stolen by the PRI.</p>
        <p>Early on, Mexican democrats rejected Fidel Castro's call to armed rebellion. While PRI governments preached nationalism, the democrats looked to the 1960's civil rights movement and routine transfer of power through the polls in the United States. The movement grew through opposition political parties and civic groups, the opening of independent news media and campaigns for clean and fair elections.</p>
        <p>Here is a look at four Mexicans who dedicated years of work to these purposes:</p>
        <p>Luis H. Alvarez, 80, Politician</p>
        <p>Although his friends thought he had lost his mind, Mr. Alvarez took on the PRI back in 1958, when the system was at its apogee. He was the presidential candidate of the National Action Party, or PAN, now Mr. Fox's party. When Mr. Alvarez's caravan rolled into one town, the local PRI warlord greeted him by declaring he was under arrest.</p>
        <p>''Why?'' Mr. Alvarez asked.</p>
        <p>''You are an opposition presidential candidate -- that's illegal,'' the PRI leader responded, and threw him in jail.</p>
        <p>Slowly the PAN began winning elections. The PRI, seeing the need for some outlet for popular discontent with its rule, allowed the opposition to keep victories that did not threaten its grip on national power.</p>
        <p>In 1986, however, the PRI decided that the governor's post in the border state of Chihuahua was one it could not lose. PRI operatives brazenly raided polling stations and stuffed fistfuls of pre-marked ballots into the boxes. Mr. Alvarez, then the mayor of the state capital, declared a hunger strike that lasted 40 days.</p>
        <p>His protest was widely echoed. Businesses in the state shut down for 48 hours. Voters sat in to block border crossings to the United States. President Miguel de la Madrid defended the ''patriotic fraud,'' saying that the PRI could not allow a strategic border state to fall to the PAN. The PRI won that vote but the world became aware of its abuses.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Alvarez is finishing a term as federal senator. With a big smile, he called Mr. Fox's election ''a dream made real.''</p>
        <p>Sergio Aguayo, 52, Elections Monitor</p>
        <p>Mr. Aguayo's turning points were marked by three death threats he received from the PRI regime.</p>
        <p>As a teenager in the early 1960's in a working-class barrio in Guadalajara, he had fistfights with PRI student gangs.</p>
        <p>''The PRI's key word was loyalty,'' Mr. Aguayo recalled. ''To get into politics you had to agree to be humiliated. I never did.''</p>
        <p>He was swept up in the pro-democracy student movement in Mexico City in 1968. But when he tried to organize at home in Guadalajara, armed PRI student squads came after him. Soon many of his friends were driven underground and became leftist guerrillas. Mr. Aguayo refused to join them. ''I thought taking up rifles was suicide and would  get us nowhere.''</p>
        <p>Since he did not hide, he was a PRI target and received his first death threat. He fled back to Mexico City.</p>
        <p>He became a college professor but used his spare time to organize civic groups to defend Indians in the southern state of Chiapas. The second threat was a handwritten note from the Chiapas security police in 1981, telling him to leave the state. Mr. Aguayo realized that Mexico needed groups to defend human rights, which PRI governments spurned as the agenda of a meddling United States. Three years later he helped found the Mexican Academy for Human Rights.</p>
        <p>Offended by what seemed to be PRI fraud in the presidential vote of 1988, Mr. Aguayo turned to elections monitoring. He modeled his observer group, Alianza Civica, on the American civil rights movement. By the 1994 presidential race, it was organized all over the country.</p>
        <p>He got his third death threat, a detailed note indicating that the sender knew all of his movements.</p>
        <p>This year Mr. Aguayo ran for Congress as a human rights candidate from a splinter opposition party, and lost. But he is happy. ''At the end of this 40-year story, we beat the authoritarian system, '' he said, astonished. ''We won.''</p>
        <p>Elena Poniatowska, 67, Writer</p>
        <p>A feminist, Ms. Poniatowska is worried about what Mr. Fox, a Catholic who opposes abortion, will do on women's issues. But she was thrilled that the PRI was defeated peacefully. ''My people acted nobly.''</p>
        <p>Descended from Polish royalty, Ms. Poniatowska started out in journalism in the social pages of a Mexico City daily.</p>
        <p>In 1968, friends told her to see for herself what Tlatelolco Plaza in Mexico City looked like after the army broke up a student demonstration. ''There was blood in the stairwells,'' she recalled. ''President Diaz Ordaz reacted to the students like a father who slays a disobedient son by clubbing him over the head with a chair.''</p>
        <p>The Mexican press largely omitted the student deaths. Ms. Poniatowska wrote a book of personal accounts of the massacre.</p>
        <p>In 1984 she helped start La Jornada, a daily newspaper that remains fiercely critical of the PRI. After a 1985 earthquake leveled whole blocks in Mexico City, La Jornada was the only newspaper of several where she wrote that would carry her reports on the search for the dead and on corruption in public construction.</p>
        <p>Although the long student strike at the national university that ended last February was unpopular, Ms. Poniatowska's columns helped protect the leaders from abuse after the police broke it up.</p>
        <p>''When I was younger my society friends told me that I did not get invited anywhere because I was on the wrong side of the fence,'' she said. ''I was always with strikers instead of government ministers. Now I am sure that I was on the right side of the fence.''</p>
        <p>Homero Aridjis, 60, Poet and Environmentalist</p>
        <p>Mr. Aridjis first fell out with the PRI system 18 years ago by refusing to follow a government order to cancel a poetry festival. With Ted Hughes and Lawrence Ferlinghetti already in Mexico City, he said, he went ahead and held an improvised festival anyway.</p>
        <p>''They started to block me,'' Mr. Aridjis said, recalling a time when PRI governments had the power to decide which writers would become famous. ''I ceased to exist as a poet.''</p>
        <p>In 1985, after a day of black asphyxiating smog over the capital city, Mr. Aridjis rallied 100 Mexican artists and intellectuals to sign a declaration telling the government, ''This contamination is killing us all.'' The petition gave birth to the Mexican environmental movement, endowing it with extraordinary moral authority. A few years later Mr. Aridjis's demand that lead be removed from gasoline was met by the government.</p>
        <p>Since then he has fought to protect monarch butterflies, protested the slaughter of sea tortoises, and battled for gray whale sanctuaries, forging new ways of badgering the government and letting himself in for new forms of harassment.</p>
        <p>This year's election, he said, opens up new possibilities for his cause.</p>
        <p>''We could never hope to have respect for the environment in Mexico without democracy, without accountability,'' Mr. Aridjis said.</p>
