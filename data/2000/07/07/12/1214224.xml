      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Drop a little cube into boiling water and get, not everyday chicken or beef bouillon, but a porcini mushroom broth for making a risotto, mushroom soup or a stew. Plop another tiny cube, a creamy frozen square of minced garlic, into a pasta sauce, and watch it dissolve, releasing a sharp jolt of flavor.</p>
        <p>The porcini cubes, from Italy, are sold in boxes of 10 for $1.98 at Fairway, 2127 Broadway (74th Street) and 2328 12th Avenue (132nd Street), and at Zabar's, 80th Street and Broadway. The garlic cubes, from Israel, come frozen; each is the equivalent of one clove and is made only of garlic, vegetable oil and salt. They are sold in packages of 20 for $2.99 at Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas (Ninth Street) and 133A West 66th Street.</p>

        <p>Fairway also carries cubes made of herbs like oregano, rosemary, basil or parsley, which can add flavor to broths and sauces; they are $1.98 for eight. And Zabar's has a tomato and onion bouillon cube. I would take these cook's helpers along on summer camping trips. One caveat: they are salty, so don't do any seasoning until they've been added.</p>
