        <p>As a teenager growing up in Indiana, I worked in my father's grocery for 75 cents an hour. Since I was the boss's son, I got all the lousy jobs, like cleaning up spilled milk that had soured in the refrigerator, so that no one would think I was getting special treatment. I was paid for a 40-hour week, but I was working my father's hours. We'd get up at 5:30 a.m. to stop by a market and pick up the produce, and we didn't get home until 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>On the hour drive to the store and on the trip home -- at least the times I was awake -- I learned life's lessons from my father. He taught me about integrity and respecting people no matter what their stature. He had a wallhanging in the kitchen: ''Don't try to teach a pig to sing. It wastes your time and annoys the pig.'' I have that saying framed in my office. It reminds me that you have to start with a certain amount of capability or you're pretty limited in what you can do.</p>

        <p>On the hour drive to the store and on the trip home -- at least the times I was awake -- I learned life's lessons from my father. He taught me about integrity and respecting people no matter what their stature. He had a wallhanging in the kitchen: ''Don't try to teach a pig to sing. It wastes your time and annoys the pig.'' I have that saying framed in my office. It reminds me that you have to start with a certain amount of capability or you're pretty limited in what you can do.</p>
        <p>Every Memorial Day at our backyard barbecue, we'd listen to the Indy 500 on the radio and keep track of who was leading. I had oversized postcards of all the drivers on my bedroom wall, and I still remember the year -- 1955 -- that Bill Vukovich, who had won two years in a row, was killed while leading a third consecutive time.</p>
        <p>Working at Eli Lilly had a special aura in my town. One summer I asked a neighbor who worked there as a trucker if he knew of any jobs. I got a summer job unloading coal cars and cleaning boilers, and I worked weekends there while attending Purdue. In my junior year I learned that they were only hiring pharmacists, so I switched my major from chemistry to pharmacy. After Purdue I went straight to Indiana University for my M.B.A. in marketing, but when Lilly recruited on campus I couldn't get an interview. Now they were only hiring accountants. Luckily, I had developed a few contacts, so I got a job.</p>
        <p>Then they asked my geographical preference, and I said Denver or Dallas or San Francisco. They came back with Terre Haute, and I said ''no thanks,'' assuming I had a choice. The second time, they explained it so that there could be no doubt -- I'd be going to Toledo.</p>
        <p>When Eli Lilly was spinning off the division that became Guidant, I went to J. P. Morgan in New York to seek debt financing. My daughter, a high school senior, had quite a reputation as a cross-country runner and soccer player. One of the bankers came up to me afterward, and I thought he wanted to acknowledge me. Instead he asked: ''Are you Stephanie Dollens's father?''</p>
        <p>For the I.P.O. road show, a few of us went on a 10-day trip and gave 55 presentations. By the 55th time I spoke I even bored myself. On one trip, from Boston to New York, we hadn't eaten all day, so we ordered a pizza on the way to the Lilly corporate plane and told them what hangar we'd be in. We persuaded the pilot to hold the plane so we could have the pizza delivered.</p>
        <p>Once, in San Francisco, we had a new person in human resources. He was a corporate type who was from the Midwest like me. He wanted to fire a scientist found sleeping under a workbench in the R&amp;D lab, and he needed my approval. I asked the man's name.</p>
        <p>When he told me who it was, I suggested he go and look at the patent wall and count the number of times the man's name appeared. I said that the scientist had probably been working all night and that the next time he saw him under the bench he might want to get him a pillow.</p>
