        <p>Gallo Blue Chip turned out to be a great horse after receiving a low ranking as a 2-year-old. He was ranked 21st but won all eight of his races.</p>
        <p>Now as a 3-year-old, Gallo Blue Chip is the overwhelming favorite to capture the $1,150,000 Meadowlands Pace on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Gallo Blue Chip was made the 8-5 early favorite today in the post-position draw even though he will leave from the ninth spot in a field of 10 horses in the richest pacing event in the history of harness racing.</p>
        <p>Trained by Mark Ford and driven by Daniel Dube, Gallo Blue Chip captured his elimination heat last Saturday by almost three lengths in 1:50.1 for his fifth victory in 10 starts this season. His time was the fastest of all three eliminations for the 24th edition of the Meadowlands Pace.</p>
        <p>Gallo Blue Chip also captured the $1 million North America Cup on June 24, also in 1:50.1 for the second-fastest time in the history of that race. It was the biggest career victory for Ford, Dube and Martin Scharf, the owner. All three were making their first appearance in a million-dollar race. ''Things have been working out pretty good,'' Ford said today. ''I wish we can a better draw, but it could also be worse.''</p>
        <p>Scharf bought Gallo Blue Chip for $100,000 at the beginning of his 2-year-old campaign, and the son of Magical Mike surprised everyone by winning all eight races he entered. But his biggest victories came this season and he could increase his earnings this season to almost $1.2 million with a victory Saturday.</p>
        <p>''Winning the North America Cup was a thrill and a relief,'' Scharf said. ''Even if you know a horse is good, he has to prove it. I've been in this business for 10 years and you never really know if you have that caliber of a horse.''</p>
        <p>Scharf and his crew have high hopes for Saturday's race, the seventh on the card, because the last five winners of the North America Cup have gone on to capture the Meadowlands Pace.</p>
        <p>Gallo Blue Chip's record for the year is five victories and two second-place finishes in 10 events. He started the season poorly by breaking stride in his first three races because he was hit in the eye with a whip.</p>
        <p>''He made breaks in all three, but we managed to straighten things out,'' Ford said. ''He's a little hard to train. You won't be impressed if you train him in the middle of the week, but he is good when he races.''</p>
        <p>Tyberwood, who finished second to Gallo Blue Chip in the North America Cup and third in last Saturday's elimination, is the second early choice at 4-1. The third choice at 5-1 is the entry of Astreos and High on Emotion, both trained by Brett Pelling, who has trained three Meadowlands Pace winners, including last year with The Panderosa.</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>JOHN CAMPBELL, who has driven five winners in the Meadowlands Pace, will drive Ain't No Stopn Him, who is at 8-1 and will leave from the fifth spot. . . . The other horses in the field of 10 are San Gimignano at 6-1; Mr. Prez at 10-1, along with Aces N' Sevens; Jersey Bouncer at 12-1; and Indian Territory at 30-1.</p>
