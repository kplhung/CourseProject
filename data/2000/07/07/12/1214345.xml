      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In an exercise in pedagogical archaeology, Harold O. Levy, the chancellor of New York City schools, recently ordered his legal staff to sift through more than 30 volumes of Board of Education regulations and bulletins accumulated over the last five decades with a kind of Jarndyce v. Jarndyce reverence for bureaucratic minutiae. After reviewing them, Mr. Levy eliminated 94 of 169 regulations and all but 150 of 1,500 special circulars. Like pottery fragments, the now obsolete documents trace the cultural history of the schools. They begin at a time of idealism and innocence, when space was a new frontier and every school had a piano (in tune), and end in the present era of grim pragmatism, marked by concerns about poverty, drugs, homelessness and union work rules. Here are some highlights.</p>

They begin at a time of idealism and innocence, when space was a new frontier and every school had a piano (in tune), and end in the present era of grim pragmatism, marked by concerns about poverty, drugs, homelessness and union work rules. Here are some highlights.</p>
        <p>DEC. 19, 1960  Christmas Message</p>
        <p>In the middle of all the currents and cross-winds besetting all of us in today's world, it is comforting to know that there are constants; there are fixed truths by which we may guide our thought and action. They are found in the great ethical and moral deposits of the Judeo-Christian philosophy. . .  -- John J. Theobald, superintendent</p>
        <p>APRIL 10, 1961  Piano Inventory Report</p>
        <p>Requests for additional pianos or replacements will be given sympathetic consideration if they are justified in terms of actual need . . . Requests for tuning and minor repairs will be honored only if made on official card forms which may be obtained from the Music Bureau.</p>
        <p>FEB. 26, 1962  Welcome to Colonel Glenn</p>
        <p>We suggest that principals of schools adjacent to the route of the parade from Idlewild Airport to City Hall and from City Hall to the Waldorf-Astoria, Manhattan, permit all pupils who receive parental permission to be excused to watch the parade when it passes through their area . . . Some pertinent topics which may be discussed: the importance of the exploration of space . . . career and character of Colonel Glenn . . .</p>
        <p>OCT. 24, 1962  Civil Defense Drills</p>
        <p>It is probable that present international tensions can and will be resolved through peaceful means. Nevertheless, our great responsibility requires preparation against every foreseeable contingency.  -- Bernard E. Donovan, acting superintendent (during the Cuban missile crisis)</p>
        <p>DEC. 5, 1963  Pupil Suggestions for Suitable Memorial Tribute to the Late President John F. Kennedy</p>
        <p>It is hoped that the interest and participation of our school children in this activity will indicate to the public at large the deep concern felt by our pupils at the tragic death of President Kennedy.  -- Calvin E. Gross, superintendent</p>
        <p>APRIL 5, 1968  A Memorial to Rev. Martin Luther King</p>
        <p>Each school should today and on the day of Dr. King's funeral conduct appropriate exercises in classrooms or assemblies which will emphasize the ideals for which he crusaded so powerfully to raise the sights of man . . .</p>
        <p>SEPT. 27, 1968  Education of Pregnant Students</p>
        <p>In recent years the number of pregnant girls of school age has been increasing steadily. These students present a unique educational problem for which we have been attempting to make provisions.</p>
        <p>SEPT. 17, 1976  Phasing Out of Special Schools (Pregnant Girls)</p>
        <p>As a result of drastic cuts in budget necessitated by the fiscal crisis, it will be necessary to phase out the following installations as of February 1, 1977 . . . No new pupils will be admitted.  -- Irving Anker, chancellor</p>
        <p>DEC. 6, 1976  Gifts to Board of Education Personnel</p>
        <p>Please indicate, tactfully but firmly, to parents and children that the giving of presents to secretaries and teachers is not in the best interest of all the children and is therefore forbidden.</p>
        <p>FEB. 15, 1977  Drug Abuse Reporting Form</p>
        <p>We are preparing to collect all available data on drug use among our school children.</p>
        <p>SEPT. 4, 1979  Eligibility for Free and Reduced Price Meals and/or Free Milk</p>
        <p>No denial of meals as a disciplinary action . . .</p>
        <p>DEC. 28, 1979  Parking on School Property</p>
        <p>The parking of cars of members of the teaching or custodial staff or outsiders on school premises shall not be permitted except upon the written authorization of the chancellor.  -- Frank J. Macchiarola, chancellor</p>
        <p>SEPT. 4, 1984  Reports of Suspected Child Abuse and Maltreatment</p>
        <p>The principal or designee must report this immediately . . .  -- Nathan Quinones, chancellor</p>
        <p>AUG. 8, 1988  Uniform Visitor Control Procedures</p>
        <p>In all schools the principal will assign a school safety officer to the school's main entry. . . A color-coded pass that only allows the visitor to go to the general office should then be issued . . .</p>
        <p>AUG. 23, 1988  Elimination of the Use of Time Clocks by Professional Staff</p>
        <p>It is my view that professionals should not be required to use time clocks . . .  -- Richard R. Green, chancellor</p>
        <p>OCT. 26, 1989  Victim Support Program</p>
        <p>. . . has been established to provide practical assistance and psychological support to staff members who are victims of school-related assaults.  -- Bernard Mecklowitz, acting chancellor</p>
        <p>DEC. 6, 1990  Lesson Plans</p>
        <p>The New York City public schools and the United Federation of Teachers have incorporated the following into our 1990-91 agreement . . . the specifics of each (lesson) plan will be left to the professional judgment of the teacher. Lesson plans are for the personal use of the teacher . . . Since the mechanical, ritualized collection of lesson plans does not further these goals, it is prohibited.  -- Joseph A. Fernandez, chancellor</p>
        <p>Compiled with assistance from Daniel McCray, chancellor's legal staff.</p>
