        <p>A FRIEND told me recently that he'd just bought a car without driving it first. I was appalled. ''How could you buy it without getting the feel of it?'' I asked. ''But it's loaded!'' he responded. ''The leather, the CD player, all the goodies.''</p>
        <p>I was still appalled. And I quickly saw a parallel in the college search now rattling about our household. With our son careering toward his senior year in high school, my wife and I pore over college guides. We are looking, at least in part, for a college that is both ''loaded'' -- as measured not by CD's but by average SAT's, faculty ratios, academics, whatever excellence can be quantified -- and at the same time a realistic choice.</p>

        <p>A FRIEND told me recently that he'd just bought a car without driving it first. I was appalled. ''How could you buy it without getting the feel of it?'' I asked. ''But it's loaded!'' he responded. ''The leather, the CD player, all the goodies.''</p>
        <p>I was still appalled. And I quickly saw a parallel in the college search now rattling about our household. With our son careering toward his senior year in high school, my wife and I pore over college guides. We are looking, at least in part, for a college that is both ''loaded'' -- as measured not by CD's but by average SAT's, faculty ratios, academics, whatever excellence can be quantified -- and at the same time a realistic choice.</p>
        <p>The crucial thing, though, is finding a college that will feel right to our son. His choice of a college, with whatever guidance we manage to sneak in along the way, is a dauntingly big decision. It will be the first place he lives on his own, might well provide him with lasting friends, and will do much to shape his future, professionally and otherwise.</p>
        <p>But while it's easy to get a feel for a car (if you drive it, that is), it's awfully hard to really test drive a college. The manner of the tour guide on the day you visit, the weather, your mood, some oddity in the cafeteria, a chance comment from someone who knows someone who goes there -- any or all could loom out of proportion. Many colleges set up weekends for accepted students, but even those depend largely on the few students you link up with.</p>
        <p>Another friend told me recently that her son, who is midway through college, had really chosen the wrong school. He had visited this college first and loved it. But, she later realized, it was the college experience he'd gotten a delicious taste of -- the glorious independence. It hadn't fully sunk in, apparently, that independence would come at any college, and that colleges differ greatly.</p>
        <p>That tale reinforced my instinct to see as many colleges as our schedules, and patience, would allow over the winter and spring. Our son made it to about 10 schools, ranging from giant Boston University to tiny Muhlenberg, along with midsize schools like Villanova, which, is the size that feels right to him now. But it can become a blur. When we did the whole drill -- including information session -- at two schools in a single day, we all suffered severe tour overload.</p>
        <p>I marveled at all the computer hookups, the wired dorms, the smart cards that get you everything from dorm access to potato chips (hey, I thought, it looks like fun going to college now), and scanned the parade of students to see if they leaned more to Abercrombie or pierced eyebrows. I also tried to get a sense of how much temptation there would be to party your education away. (My conclusion: the temptation is everywhere, in spite of the sober, rehearsed answers given by tour guides.)</p>
        <p>My wife and I, as we hover nervously over this process, bring far different perspectives to bear. While she's trying to recreate the positive college experience she had, I think in terms of helping him avoid my bad experience.</p>
        <p>After a wrong turn in freshman year, she found her niche and lapped up college and graduate school gleefully. I, however, squeaked into a ''loaded'' college via the waiting list, panicked at the sudden competition, skipped numerous classes, and flunked out in my junior year. I took so long to try again elsewhere that, in an educational Mobius strip, a college classmate had become an admissions dean at the school where I finally finished.</p>
        <p>And I often catch myself considering colleges in terms of what I would prefer. I like cities, for instance, and often wish I could get to know Boston better, so I was immediately intrigued by Boston University. But no, it's my son's turn.</p>
        <p>I've heard people say that you should go to a good school not so much for the professors but for the caliber of students you'll rub shoulders with -- and, of course, ''network'' with later in your awesomely dynamic careers.</p>
        <p>Well, O.K. But unless I missed something, college is still mainly about learning -- learning guided by professors. No statistics about a school's supposed excellence can provide a clue about which professors will strike a spark in which students. The one professor branded in my memory was not at the high-octane college I first attended, but at the school for dropouts (not its official name) where I finished. He was a fiery red-headed man who, with his rich, resonant voice threatening to burst the confines of the tiny classroom, brought Donne and Shakespeare to dancing life.</p>
        <p>I want that magic for my son. How do we track it down?</p>
        <p>The answer, of course, is that I probably won't. It will be up to him.</p>
