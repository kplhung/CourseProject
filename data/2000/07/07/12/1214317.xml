        <p>William C. Thompson Jr. was unanimously re-elected president of the Board of Education yesterday, and he promised that his coming run for city comptroller would not interfere with his duties on the board.</p>

        <p>William C. Thompson Jr. was unanimously re-elected president of the Board of Education yesterday, and he promised that his coming run for city comptroller would not interfere with his duties on the board.</p>
        <p>''It is my intention at this point to serve a full term,'' Mr. Thompson said after the 7-to-0 vote. ''There's a lot of talk about me running for comptroller and yes, I am going to do that. But I don't think it distracts from the job I am going to do here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson, a Democrat, was appointed to the board in 1994 by Howard Golden, the Brooklyn borough president. Since 1996, he has served four consecutive terms as board president. His fifth term will end next June, just as his race for city comptroller will be heating up.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani considered trying to oust Mr. Thompson from the presidency last year, after Mr. Thompson refused to support his proposal to experiment with a voucher program that would use tax dollars to finance private school tuition for some students. But the mayor backed down at the last minute, saying that a change in leadership could delay improvements to the school system.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Giuliani praised Mr. Thompson at a news conference and announced that he had again directed his two appointees to the board, Irene H. Impellizzeri and Ninfa Segarra, to support Mr. Thompson's re-election, making it all but certain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson said yesterday that he had met with the mayor this week and described their conversation as nonconfrontational. But he said that he would continue to oppose Mr. Giuliani's voucher plan, and he expressed wariness about several other mayoral proposals, including one to privatize the management of failing schools and another to sell the board's labyrinthine headquarters at 110 Livingston Street in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''There are still going to be a number of things that we will continue to disagree about,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''I've always stood up for what I believed in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson also said that he disagreed with Mr. Giuliani's proposal to replace across-the-board salary increases for teachers with merit raises, which would be limited to teachers whose students improve academically over the course of a school year. The city will be negotiating a new contract with the teachers' union over the next year, and the union has said that merit raises would be unacceptable.</p>
        <p>''I am not a believer in merit pay only,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''But I do believe in merit pay on top of real baseline salary increases. I just think that right now we have an erosion of teachers in this city, and we need to make sure that we increase the number of qualified teachers.''</p>
