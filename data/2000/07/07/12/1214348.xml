        <p>Scott Layden stood on the top floor of an abandoned town house in Harlem yesterday morning. His sleeves were rolled up after knocking down old drywall for two hours, which left the arms and the face of the Knicks' general manager caked with plaster, soot and sweat.</p>
        <p>It was all part of the Knicks' rehabilitation project with Fannie Mae.</p>
        <p>In the next three days, Layden will extend a clean hand and polished smile to Brian Grant, the Portland Trail Blazers power forward, who is the most recent free agent to figure into the Knicks' own reconstruction plans.</p>
        <p>Grant is coming to New York tonight and will meet with the Knicks tomorrow and Friday. Although other teams have expressed interest in Grant, the Knicks are the first team he will be visiting since he announced last month that he had opted out of his contract with the Trail Blazers.</p>
        <p>Layden said he planned to sell Grant on the green hills and mansions of suburbia, along with the team's success within Madison Square Garden in order to persuade him to sign with the Knicks on Aug. 1.</p>
        <p>''I think it's an opportunity for him to get to know him, to know us and the city,'' Layden said. ''I think we need to talk to him about the team and the organization, show him the outstanding city we have here and the outlying areas.''</p>
        <p>Unlike Detroit's Grant Hill and San Antonio's Tim Duncan, the two highest-profile free agents, Grant agreed at least to visit the Knicks. He will bring his wife, Gina, on the trip as well.</p>
        <p>The Knicks are interested in the 6-foot-9-inch Grant for his offensive rebounding presence and his hard-working six years of experience in the league. Grant, 28 years old, would be part of a sign-and-trade deal, because of the Knicks' salary cap restrictions. The Trail Blazers could very likely ask for Latrell Sprewell or Allan Houston in exchange.</p>
        <p>Grant, who came off the bench this season for Rasheed Wallace, last month opted out of his contract with Portland, forgoing a deal that would have paid him $40 million in the remaining four seasons on his seven-year deal. Grant averaged 21 minutes this season, a career low, and was hampered by injuries.</p>
        <p>He missed seven games at the beginning of the season while recovering from surgery to his left knee and also suffered from plantar fasciitis in his right foot, missing eight games late in the season.</p>
        <p>''He's a solid player, a very good offensive rebounder with a good low-post game,'' Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ''He's had some trouble at times with injuries, but he's a very, very good player and he's been able to do that for good teams.''</p>
        <p>Grant could still re-sign with Portland, which is eager to keep him.</p>
        <p>''We want Brian back and we will work to re-sign him,'' Trail Blazers General Manager Bob Whitsitt has said of Grant. ''He has been a very important piece of the puzzle and we will work very hard to keep him in Portland.''</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers have reportedly made another offer to Grant, though his agent, Mark Bartelstein, would not discuss specifics.</p>
        <p>''That's between us and the Blazers right now,'' Bartelstein said.</p>
        <p>Grant is expected to ask for the maximum salary starting at $9 million a year.</p>
        <p>Studious Draft Picks</p>
        <p>The Knicks' second-round draft pick, St. John's guard Lavor Postell, and the last pick in the National Basketball Association draft, Pete Mickeal, are eager to make a good impression. The two players were the first to arrive yesterday at the community service project on Frederick Douglas Boulevard.</p>
        <p>Postell and Mickeal, who was acquired with Erick Strickland in a trade with Dallas, have been working out together and learning the Knicks' plays for the last five days in anticipation of the start of the team's summer minicamp, which begins today at Fairfield University.</p>
        <p>''They're both hard-working, tough-minded players,'' Jeff Van Gundy said. ''I'm very interested to see how they play.''</p>
        <p>Charlie Ward was the other Knicks player who helped with the project yesterday, not getting too dirty before leaving to run his summer basketball camp.</p>
        <p>Even though the Knicks seem to have a surplus of guards after the draft, Van Gundy asserted that Ward was still the starting point guard.</p>
        <p>''Oh absolutely,'' Van Gundy said. ''There's no question.''</p>
        <p>Weis Is Delayed</p>
        <p>There is still a question, however, about the Knicks' Frederic Weis, last year's first-round draft pick, who is still unsigned.</p>
        <p>He is on the Knicks' summer camp roster, but will not be arriving from France in time to attend today.</p>
        <p>''I don't know when he is coming,'' Scott Layden said. ''His father is ill right now.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks do know that Seton Hall's Shaheen Holloway will be among the free agents attending the summer camp.</p>
