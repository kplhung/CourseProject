        <p>Bob Katz Op-Ed article says fatal fight between two hockey dads in suburban Boston underscores the inappropriate intrusion of adults into children's games; says parents today see sports as a way for children to develop the drive and perseverance they will need for adult achievement, not as a way for developing the skills that enable them to have fun and enjoy life more (M)</p>

        <p>Parents of children involved in organized sports may be tempted to think that the tragedy in suburban Boston last week, when a fight between two hockey dads turned fatal, has nothing to do with them. We'll tell ourselves that an event like that has more to do with the individuals involved than with youth sports in general.</p>
        <p>But marginalizing the episode -- a 42-year-old truck driver was charged with manslaughter after the other man died of brain injuries outside a hockey rink where their sons had played a pickup game -- is just a convenient way to deflect troublesome concerns before they creep too close. Sideline parents are quite familiar with the syndrome of getting worked up at their kids' sporting events.</p>

        <p>Parents of children involved in organized sports may be tempted to think that the tragedy in suburban Boston last week, when a fight between two hockey dads turned fatal, has nothing to do with them. We'll tell ourselves that an event like that has more to do with the individuals involved than with youth sports in general.</p>
        <p>But marginalizing the episode -- a 42-year-old truck driver was charged with manslaughter after the other man died of brain injuries outside a hockey rink where their sons had played a pickup game -- is just a convenient way to deflect troublesome concerns before they creep too close. Sideline parents are quite familiar with the syndrome of getting worked up at their kids' sporting events.</p>
        <p>Watching your child compete is a singularly wrenching experience. Nobody is immune from bad behavior. I have watched in disgust as some jerk lambastes a hapless 8-year-old (''Use your left foot!''), only minutes later to hear myself howling an equally pointless rant (''Watch the ball!'').</p>
        <p>Whenever the topic of bad sideline behavior arises, it is often dismissed as a situation that has always been with us. Many parents, especially fathers, have long been accused of seeking thwarted glory through their children.</p>
        <p>But something different is at work these days, whatever the special circumstances of last week's confrontation, and it is becoming severe.</p>
        <p>Over-the-top parental intensity does not have to turn fatal to be seen for what it clearly is: adults intruding on children's games. People who might previously have viewed sports as little more than extracurricular activities are buying into the more serious notion of sports as a metaphor for success. From the best-selling homilies of Pat Riley and other jock proselytizers to the inevitable sports analogies used by high-flying corporate chiefs to explain upticks on the Nasdaq, the culture is awash in the notion that these are more than mere games.</p>
        <p>The message, unwittingly accepted by too many parents, is that a child's success or failure on the playing field is somehow a meaningful indicator of his or her potential in life.</p>
        <p>Few parents are so deluded as to believe that their child is preparing for the Olympics or the major leagues, but when they speak openly of how youth sports build winners by inculcating drive and guts and perseverance, they are projecting forward to the world of adult achievement. That is one large burden to place on what might otherwise be casual games.</p>
        <p>It is my fear that last week's tragedy involved two dads who in their zeal to do right by their sons forgot what youth sports are all about -- children acquiring skills that enable them to have fun and to enjoy life more. This should be victory enough, for child and parent alike.</p>
