        <p>The South Korean government and labor leaders agreed today to end a strike by bank workers who walked off their jobs earlier in the day to protest mergers that could lead to thousands of layoffs.</p>
        <p>An estimated 20,000 of the country's 65,000 unionized bank workers went on strike today, as reports circulated about last-minute talks between the union and government.</p>
        <p>The union, the Korean Federation of Bank and Financial Labor Unions, had called the strike to protest legislation that would authorize the creation of financial holding companies, which regulators have suggested may be the first step in merging troubled banks. Bank workers, like workers in other Korean industries that have undergone major reorganizing in the last two years, fear that consolidation will lead to layoffs.  Union leaders hailed the agreement reached today. ''A major achievement was in making sure government-influenced bank decisions will no longer be allowed,'' said Lee Yong Deuk, the chief of the banking union.</p>
        <p>But South Korea's top financial regulator said that while the government promised not to order banks to merge, it still intended to proceed with its revamping efforts.</p>
        <p>''We expect increased momentum in implementing the next round of financial restructuring,'' said Lee Yong Keun, the chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission.</p>
        <p>Details of the agreement between the union and the government will be announced on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Still, investors saw the announcement as a sign that the government would not be diverted from an overhaul of financial services. Bank stocks surged today, even as the benchmark stock index fell 1.72 percent. Bank reorganization was a part of the package of changes the South Korean government accepted in return for a $58 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund in late 1997. In December 1997, there were 33 South Korean banks, including state-invested banks. By the end of last year, there were 23. From December 1997 to 1998, the number of bank workers fell to 75,332 from 113,493. Kim Dae Shik, a professor of economics at Chung Ang University here, noted that the government's resolve in cleaning up troubled investment trusts weakened last year, compared with its closing of banks in 1998. ''During the last two and a half years, there was no set gauge that governed bank restructuring,'' he said. ''I believe the government will use the next round of restructuring as a milestone for its restructuring drive.''</p>
