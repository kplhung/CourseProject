        <p>Making Friends On Trip to Balkans</p>
        <p>It is blossoming into a surprisingly cozy mutual admiration society: GOV. GEORGE E. PATAKI and BIANCA JAGGER have had nothing but flattering things to say about each other since their trip to the Balkans with a delegation that met with officials in Kosovo, Montenegro and Bosnia.</p>
        <p>A few days after they returned last month, Ms. Jagger said she had been very impressed by the governor, who is a Republican.</p>
        <p>''He was always in good humor,'' said Ms. Jagger, a frequent champion of liberal causes who once dated SENATOR ROBERT G. TORRICELLI, a Democrat. ''He is very personable, and it was easy to deal with him, and these are not easy trips.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jagger even said she thought that Mr. Pataki could be vice president. ''He would be capable of anything he desires to do,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki returned the favor yesterday at a news conference in Albany that his aides had scheduled so he could talk about the trip.</p>
        <p>''I have an inherent skepticism of celebrities who I read about in the press,'' the governor said when he was asked about Ms. Jagger. ''But she was very serious, very hard-working, very well prepared. Whether it was being ready at the bus at 5 o'clock in the morning for a very torturous ride or sitting through dozens of meetings, and not just sitting through them, but participating and being prepared.''</p>
        <p>Some New Faces At Breakfast Table</p>
        <p>Now is the time when athletes are turning up on cereal boxes. Yesterday, PETE SAMPRAS became the first active tennis player to have his picture on a Wheaties box since CHRIS EVERT in 1987. (Arthur Ashe was pictured posthumously in 1997.) Mr. Sampras said he was thrilled ''to join the likes of Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali and all the other great athletes who have been on the Wheaties box.''</p>
        <p>Today, the Ladies Professional Golf Association is to announce that three touring pros will be pictured on boxes of Multi-Grain Cheerios (a type of Cheerios sweetened with brown sugar). The three -- LORIE KANE, CRISTIE KERR and JANICE MOODY -- will appear somewhere on the package, on the back if not the front. ''We don't have all our plans nailed down yet,'' said a spokesman for General Mills, which makes Multi-Grain Cheerios.</p>
        <p>Doer, Not Viewer</p>
        <p>On a typical Monday, eight million people watch the soap opera ''The Young and the Restless.'' The ratings from two days ago will not be released by Nielsen Media Research until next week, but this much is certain: GOV. JESSE VENTURA of Minnesota, who made a cameo appearance in Monday's episode, did not bother to watch.</p>
        <p>''You go out, you do it, you have fun doing it,'' The Associated Press quoted him as saying. ''I'll see a tape of it later. I did it weeks ago. It's not fresh in my mind now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ventura played himself in a scene with ERIC BRAEDEN, who plays the evil industrialist Victor Newman.  Victor asked Mr. Ventura why he was not running for president.</p>
        <p>''Why don't you run with me?'' Mr. Ventura said. ''We'd be the dream ticket.''</p>
        <p>Victor called that an ''interesting idea'' but raised a question: who would run for president, and who for vice president?</p>
        <p>''That would be a problem,'' Mr. Ventura said. ''If our egos were to clash, I don't think the country could survive it.''</p>
        <p>End of scene. Backstage, there was some writing going on, and not for the script. A spokeswoman for ''The Young and the Restless'' said that Mr. Ventura was given BOB BARKER'S dressing room on the day the episode was videotaped. Mr. Barker, the host of the game show ''The Price Is Right'' and an animal-rights supporter, left a note welcoming Mr. Ventura and saying he hoped that all of Mr. Ventura's pets had been spayed or neutered. The spokeswoman said that Mr. Ventura left a note for Mr. Barker that said they had.</p>
