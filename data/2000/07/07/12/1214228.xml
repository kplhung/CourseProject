        <p>Correction of July 5 review of Tish Boyle's new dessert cookbook</p>
      </abstract>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The By the Book column in the Dining section last Wednesday about two cookbooks focusing on old-fashioned desserts misstated an ingredient in a recipe for cherry pie in ''Diner Desserts'' by Tish Boyle, and then based its criticism of the book on that error. The recipe calls for fresh or frozen cherries and describes canned cherries as ''a distant third choice.'' But the column said it called for canned and added: ''That's the downside to throwback baking. It's too bad the author did not suggest fresh fruit as an alternative.''</p>
