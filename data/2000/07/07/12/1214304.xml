        <p>John F. Welch Jr., chairman of General Electric and one of the most successful executives in business, is expected to become one of the highest paid authors as well.</p>
        <p>Several major New York publishers began bidding for the right to publish a book by Mr. Welch with John A. Byrne, a senior writer for Business Week. A deal for the right to publish the book in the United States could be announced as early as today, for an advance of more than $6.5 million, according to people involved in the bidding.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for General Electric, based in Fairfield, Conn., said Mr. Welch planned to donate the proceeds to charity. Mr. Welch, who is 64, plans to retire next year. Although several books have been written about Mr. Welch's widely admired business philosophy, publishers hope his book will have a singular appeal to executives and managers.</p>
        <p>The expected advance would be among the highest paid for a book by a public figure. By comparison, Gen. Colin Powell, a returning war hero and aspiring presidential candidate, sold his memoirs for about $6.5 million, in a deal that included the right to sales outside the United States as well.</p>
