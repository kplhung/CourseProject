        <p>Is time money? No, but it is worth a lot more to many workers. By a margin of almost two to one, respondents in a recent national survey by Harris Poll that was commissioned by FleetBoston financial said they would rather have more time off than be paid more money.</p>
        <p>Is it any wonder? The average employee works almost two more hours a week than in 1982, according to the Brueau of Labor Statistics. Over the same period, the percentage of married ocuples who both work has risen to 47 percent from 39 percent, putting even more time pressures on families.</p>
        <p>Given these trends, something has to give, and for many employees that something is sleep. Almost half of the respondents in the Harris survey said they logged six hours of sleep or less each night.</p>
        <p>Still, though 83 percent of the respondents in the survey said employers had a responsibility to recognize that employees have lives outside of work, 62 percent believed they had to work long hours to show a commitment to their employers and their jobs.</p>
        <p>That loyalty may seem surprising given that three-quarters of those surveyed said they did not worry about job security, almost 40 percent said they were living paycheck to paycheck and more than 70 percent said they were not able to save money.</p>
