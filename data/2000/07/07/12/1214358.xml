        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I agree that the proposal by the American Federation of Teachers to add a fifth year to high school is inadequate (''Recipe for Weaker Schools,'' editorial, July 7). I suggest instead that the school day and the school year be lengthened.</p>
        <p>I propose that the day start at 8 a.m. and end at 4:30 or 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, and that the school year begin in mid-August and end in mid-July. There could be a break for the week around Christmas and another the week around Easter.</p>
        <p>The advantages of this schedule would include less free time for students to get into trouble; more time to develop skills; more time to explore academic material in depth; improved academic achievement; and higher completion rates.</p>
        <p>The United States has the fewest school days of any industrialized country, and it shows.</p>
