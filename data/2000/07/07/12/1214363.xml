        <p>The Indian software company Infosys Technologies Ltd., the first Indian company to list its stock in the United States, announced a profit of 1.27 billion rupees in the three months that ended on June 30, up from 606.1 million a year ago. The profit included an extraordinary gain of 54.9 million rupees. Total income rose to 3.71 billion rupees from 1.84 billion rupees. The rise in earnings was largely driven by a sharp jump in revenues from e-commerce projects. Infosys's chairman and chief executive, N. R. Narayana Murthy, said the company would continue to post earnings growth in line with the rest of India's software companies.</p>
