        <p>Editorial scores plans by House Republican Campaign Committee to defy 1974 law that limits what state and national parties can spend in coordination with candidates</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Using an array of dubious legal strategies, the Republican and Democratic parties have for years circumvented many of the nation's campaign fund-raising laws. Now comes word that the House Republican Campaign Committee is so worried about winning Congressional races this year it is considering defying a 1974 law that limits what state and national parties can spend in coordination with candidates. Such an action would be another flagrant violation of the spirit of the election laws at a time when the public has been disgusted by campaign spending and fund-raising excesses.</p>
        <p>Proponents of busting the spending limits base their case on a recent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which declared them unconstitutional. But the United States Supreme Court has yet to be heard on the matter, and in any case the appeals court ruling applies only to the six states within its jurisdiction -- Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. Indeed the Federal Election Commission took an unusual step in June, warning the parties that the ruling applies only to these states and that, if the Supreme Court overrules the 10th Circuit, it would apply the law retroactively to any violations.</p>

        <p>Using an array of dubious legal strategies, the Republican and Democratic parties have for years circumvented many of the nation's campaign fund-raising laws. Now comes word that the House Republican Campaign Committee is so worried about winning Congressional races this year it is considering defying a 1974 law that limits what state and national parties can spend in coordination with candidates. Such an action would be another flagrant violation of the spirit of the election laws at a time when the public has been disgusted by campaign spending and fund-raising excesses.</p>
        <p>Proponents of busting the spending limits base their case on a recent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which declared them unconstitutional. But the United States Supreme Court has yet to be heard on the matter, and in any case the appeals court ruling applies only to the six states within its jurisdiction -- Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. Indeed the Federal Election Commission took an unusual step in June, warning the parties that the ruling applies only to these states and that, if the Supreme Court overrules the 10th Circuit, it would apply the law retroactively to any violations.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that parties may spend unlimited amounts of money for candidates as long as the spending is not coordinated with the candidates themselves. But the money at issue in the new case is money that would in fact be spent in direct coordination with the candidates and their campaigns. If parties were allowed to spend money this way, it would encourage anyone who had given the legal amount to a candidate to turn around and give it to a party on his behalf. Such a step would mark another evisceration of the whole concept of curbs on fund-raising and spending.</p>
        <p>The House Republican effort comes at a time of anxiety over winning seats. As John Broder and Don Van Natta report in today's Times, Democrats actually have more in the bank at present than Republicans for House races. But being behind should not tempt Republicans to gut the law. The fact that they are considering such a step, first reported in The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, suggests that campaign leaders have learned no lessons over the past few years -- no lessons from the public demand for campaign reform, no lessons from the growing popular cynicism and revulsion over a corrupt political system. It would be insulting for House Republicans to show brazen disrespect for the law as well.</p>
