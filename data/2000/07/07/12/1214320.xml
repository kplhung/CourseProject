        <p>In an inverted salute to Mussolini's dream of Fascism through physical culture, the Stadio dei Marmi, a 1937 track stadium ringed by colossal marble nude athletes is filled again -- this time by the Big Gym outdoor fitness center, a kaleidoscope of skateboards, paddle tennis courts, aerobics classes, blaring pop music and a two-story inflatable Pepsi can.</p>
        <p>Nearby, some of the most famous examples of Fascist architecture show signs of neglect and decay, including the 25,000-foot-long esplanade of mosaics that exalt Fascist conquests laid beneath a towering obelisk inscribed, ''Mussolini Dux.''</p>
        <p>The Foro Italico, a sprawling 1930's sports complex that includes the Stadio dei Marmi, is up for sale, part of a long inventory of public buildings that the government is seeking to sell to reduce its debt and meet European Union budget targets.</p>
        <p>Right-wing groups, including a small neofascist party, Movimento Sociale Italiano, have papered the streets with leaflets and posters that say, ''Hands off the Foro Mussolini,'' its original, and still taboo, name.</p>
        <p>Alleanza Nazionale, a right-wing party that has severed its ties to Fascism, calls it Foro Italico, in posters that scream, ''Culture cannot be sold!''</p>
        <p>Beneath the heated politics, however, the ado over the Foro Italico signals a broader shift in Italian sensibilities. Fascist architecture, long ignored or despised by most Italians as a disturbing reminder of an ignoble period of their history, is enjoying a comeback.</p>
        <p>''When I started studying this architecture, people told me I was crazy, that it was 'ugly and Fascist,' '' Giorgio Muratore, a professor of architecture at the University of Rome, said. ''It is only recently that people are willing to say, 'It's Fascist, but it is beautiful.' ''</p>
        <p>Professor Muratore has spent 30 years promoting a reappraisal of architects like Luigi Moretti, a Mussolini follower who designed, among other structures, a 1934 fencing pavilion, the Casa della Scherma, which is considered the architectural jewel of the Foro Italico. In 1981, the Justice Ministry took over the building to hold members of the Red Brigade terrorist group and remains a high-security courthouse, pending its sale. Mr. Moretti, who died in 1973, also designed the Watergate Hotel in Washington.</p>
        <p>Foreigners have long vaunted the ingenuity and daring of the Fascist architects, who sought to blend the classicism of ancient Rome with 20th-century functionalism and rationalism. Architecture was Mussolini's favorite mode of propaganda, and he commissioned monumental projects like the Foro Italico and E.U.R., a vast state office park that includes the stark Palazzo della Civilta del Lavoro, known as the square Coliseum.</p>
        <p>''These architects were young, they were convinced Fascists,'' said Giorgio Ciucci, an architectural historian who heads the National Academy of St. Luke here. ''It was a revolutionary movement based on youth and radical change. Architects were the interpreters of the revolution.''</p>
        <p>All over Italy, post offices, train stations and entire towns like Sabaudia, a seaside resort, reflect the grandiosity, but also the boldness, of a totalitarian regime that took power in 1922 and ended in 1943, when Mussolini was overthrown. He and his mistress were executed in 1945 and hanged by their feet in a Milan square.</p>
        <p>From the end of World War II until recently, much Italian thinking on Fascist architecture was molded by Bruno Zevi, a Jewish architectural critic who fled the Fascists' racial laws in 1940, returned to Italy in 1945 and, until his death in January, pilloried architectural classicism, modern and even ancient, as the reflection of oppression and totalitarianism. He often said, only half-jokingly, that the ''square Colosseum'' should be blown up.</p>
        <p>Ordinary Italians, awash in ancient ruins and medieval, Renaissance and Baroque treasures, mostly ignored or mocked Fascist buildings as exemplars of bad taste. The reappraisal by intellectuals began in earnest in the early 1990's, when the end of the cold war eased the the fierce politicalization of architecture, and Fascism as a viable political movement seemed long dead.</p>
        <p>Younger critics and professors began detaching aesthetics from the taint of ideology. Exhibitions, retrospectives, history books and tourist guides signaled revived interest. In 1996, Sergio Poretti, a professor of architecture at the University of Rome, began publishing Do.co.mo.mo, an artsy biannual journal devoted entirely to Fascist art and architecture.</p>
        <p>The controversy over the Foro Italico, however, has sparked a more general re-evaluation of Fascist architecture. The property, which includes the Stadio Olimpico, the largest soccer stadium here; tennis courts, swimming pools and the Stadio dei Marmi, could bring in as much as $490 million, according to some estimates. At least five bidders -- including KPMG, the accounting and consulting firm, working with Lazard of Milan -- are vying to help the Italian treasury broker the sale. Bankers say the properties are marketable not only as sport centers, but also as entertainment sites.</p>
        <p>Last week, the treasury selected a division of American Appraisal Holding, the Italian branch of American Appraisal Associates of Milwaukee to help it assess the Foro Italico market value.</p>
        <p>The property is being managed by the Italian National Olympic Committee, which uses many of the sports areas for training. The Stadio dei Marmi is being used by Big Gym, a fitness company, under a summer lease.</p>
        <p>The center-right opposition seized the sale as a political bludgeon, complaining that foreigners could end up erecting McDonald's arches over a chunk of modern Italian history.</p>
        <p>''It's absurd,'' Alessandra Mussolini, a granddaughter of the dictator, said. ''It's not just a part of history. It's a part of Rome.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mussolini, a member of Parliament for Alleanza Nazionale, said she had no problems with the Foro Italico's style -- or history. ''I like everything Fascist, and especially the architecture,'' she said. ''I live in a 1930's building.''</p>
        <p>Culture Minister Giovanna Melandri said most of the 16 Foro Italico lots were labeled historic sites, which, under Italian law, sharply limits their use and alterations. That did not mollify critics on the right or left.</p>
        <p>''It's not enough to say, 'We imposed so many conditions on the sale that no one will want to buy it,' '' Professor Muratore, a Communist, said. ''The Italian state should say that the Foro Italico, like the Colosseum, is not for sale.''</p>
        <p>A new generation of Italians seems to like the look of the Foro Italico, without worrying about its provenance. ''It's beautiful, imposing, it's majestic,'' Maria Rosaria Iorio, 20, a major in political science at the University of Rome, said as she gazed up at the Stadio dei Marmi while awaiting aerobics class.</p>
        <p>Neither she nor her friend Luisa De Vita, 19, was sure when or why it was built. ''I don't think its ancient,'' Ms. Iorio said. ''Maybe 19th or 20th century.''</p>
        <p>Told that it was built under Mussolini, the women shrugged. ''We studied him in school, and he didn't only do bad things,'' Ms. Iorio said. ''He built a lot of towns and schools.''</p>
        <p>Ms. De Vita agreed, saying: ''We have gotten so used to skyscrapers and glass office towers, but this is closer to our roots. It's classical, but with a modern feel.''</p>
