        <p>Ozires Silva, the new president of Brazil's largest airline, Varig, says he has earned the right to speak his mind about airplanes. He assembled models as a child, flew military jets in the air force and built passenger jetliners into the country's leading export business.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Silva, 69, a former top executive of the Embraer aircraft maker, is blunt about the problems that he says confront Varig -- high costs, big debts, excessively stringent government rules and a bad reputation among the flying public.</p>
        <p>''The hostility that our society has toward air transportation companies is palpable,'' Mr. Silva said. To remake Varig, he said, ''we have to remove these obstacles; you have to have soil that is relatively fertile in order to grow.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Silva, who had been a member of the Varig board, was appointed in May to replace Fernando Pinto as president after the airline reported a $53 million loss last year and its debt grew to almost $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pinto was not directly blamed for Varig's problems -- the Brazilian economy was a large reason. The recession last year caused passenger numbers to drop precipitously, while the devaluation of the real, Brazil's currency, virtually doubled the industry's already large stock of dollar-denominated debt.</p>
        <p>Of Varig's three major Brazilian competitors, one, Vasp, is battling to keep creditors from repossessing its planes, while the others, TAM and Transbrasil, have entered into what amounts to a merger that enabled them to cut flights and costs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pinto, nonetheless, did make some strategic decisions that hurt Varig. One of the most notable was a cutback in routes to save money. United States carriers quickly filled the gap and have been taking away a larger percentage of Varig's international passengers.</p>
        <p>As it became more obvious that the company needed a strong hand Varig's board decided Mr. Silva was that hand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silva has made a career of his love for airplanes. At age 13, he was already building them: models imported from the United States to his small town in the interior of the state of Sao Paulo. Even as a child, he remembered in an interview, he would open the kits and wonder why, with so many natural resources, Brazil even had to import wood for the base of the plane.</p>
        <p>''I asked myself why Brazil had fallen behind in this race,'' Mr. Silva said. ''Why couldn't Brazil manufacture its own planes?''</p>
        <p>The question stuck with Mr. Silva for 25 years, as his fascination with aviation grew. At 17, he joined the air force. He had his start as a pilot by carrying mail and supplies to distant outposts in the middle of the Amazon, landing his hydroplane on the region's snaking uncharted rivers.</p>
        <p>By his late 20's, Mr. Silva, who was already a seasoned pilot, had become a flight instructor at the Galeao air  base in Rio de Janeiro. It was there, he said, during a particularly illuminating 3 a.m. flight check over the crescent shaped Atlantic beaches, that he decided to return to his passion of building airplanes.</p>
        <p>After earning a degree in aeronautical engineering at the Aeronautical Technology Institute in Sao Paulo state, Mr. Silva came up with the design for the Bandeirante, the first-ever regional commercial jet.</p>
        <p>''At the time, we never imagined that we would be able to export the plane, so we didn't give much thought to the name and used something very Brazilian,'' Mr. Silva said. ''It turned out to be a huge complication. Imagine an American trying to say Bandeirante. It eventually became the Bandit.''</p>
        <p>Appealing to nationalist sentiments that Brazil should build its own planes, Mr. Silva finally persuaded the government and the military to support him. Embraer, known formally as Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica, was born.</p>
        <p>''On Dec. 22, 1969, the minister of the air force called me to his office and said that Embraer had to begin operations on Jan. 2, 1970, and that I was to be the president,'' Mr. Silva said. ''I was shocked. When I tried to convince him that I was not the person for the job, he told me: 'You have already created enough problems for me. Don't create another,' and threw me out of his office.''</p>
        <p>The decision was fortuitous. Mr. Silva ran Embraer off and on for 21 years until its privatization in 1995. Despite some bumps in the road, many consider Embraer the country's greatest corporate success. Indeed, the company is currently Brazil's largest exporter.</p>
        <p>With Varig, Mr. Silva has a similar challenge -- to build a competitive airline. As a start, he plans to renegotiate the company's debts with banks and leasing companies. He also wants to take over some of the routes that his competitors have been forced to give up in recent months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silva said he also would concentrate on using his influence in military and aviation circles to persuade lawmakers in Brasilia to relax the stringent controls that govern the air transport industry in Brazil.</p>
        <p>His first priority, he said, will be to press for the removal of price controls, which now limit how much the airlines can charge on domestic and international routes. Until the restrictions are removed and the airlines are allowed to adjust prices to fill seats, he said, Varig and other Brazilian carriers would have trouble making money.</p>
        <p>''When I go to Congress, I am not going to ask them to get rid of price controls,'' Mr. Silva said. ''I am going to ask them to explain to me why they exist in the first place. They won't have an answer because there isn't one.''</p>
        <p>The government says changes will be made. A bill before Congress would create a National Civil Aviation Agency, which would be responsible for reorganizing the entire industry to increase competitiveness. How and when the changes will be made remains unclear, but Mr. Silva says he plans to be in the middle of those decisions.</p>
        <p>''In the end, I would like to contribute to creating conditions so that the next 500 years of Brazil are different than the last 500 years,'' Mr. Silva said.</p>
