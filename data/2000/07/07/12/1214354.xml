        <p>Despite an intensive weeklong campaign to round up truants, more than 130,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade -- nearly 40 percent -- are missing from the most ambitious summer school program in New York City's history, the Board of Education said yesterday.</p>

        <p>Despite an intensive weeklong campaign to round up truants, more than 130,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade -- nearly 40 percent -- are missing from the most ambitious summer school program in New York City's history, the Board of Education said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The poor attendance is a costly and potentially embarrassing culmination to months of obsessive planning. And it shows how hard it is to make a difference in the lives of children, even when everything seems in place on paper, in a system as big and complex as New York City's.</p>
        <p>As summer school opened last Wednesday, Chancellor Harold O. Levy and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had announced with much fanfare that more than 300,000 students were registered. More than 200,000 of those students are required to go, and the rest are being strongly urged to attend.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy, who was hired in January for his management skills, conceded that the rocky start of summer school was a setback. ''The real honest answer is, we should have 100 percent attendance on the mandatory side,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So far, 24 percent of the students mandated to attend in third through eighth grade have not showed up, and half of the high school students required to attend are absent. While the rate of absenteeism is about the same as last year, when the city experimented with a much smaller summer school program, expectations were much higher this year, as the Board of Education and Mr. Giuliani vowed to end social promotion, the automatic advancement of students with their age group, even if they are failing.</p>
        <p>Across the city yesterday, a survey of more than a dozen schools by The New York Times found scattered problems with classrooms that lacked air-conditioning, schools that were not providing transportation, and some that were serving bag lunches instead of hot meals. But attendance was by far the biggest obstacle.</p>
        <p>From Bushwick to Harlem, many teachers were standing in front of nearly empty classes. The Board of Education has budgeted $150 million on instruction alone, for small classes of 12 to 15 students, yet many schools had just six to eight students in a class, and some had as few as three.</p>
        <p>At P.S. 132 in Springfield Gardens, Queens, several classrooms enjoyed the rare luxury of two teachers instructing the same class. In East New York, Brooklyn, teachers said it was common to find three teachers assigned to one class, with not enough students to go around.</p>
        <p>It was not clear yesterday whether the excess teachers would be laid off if attendance problems continued. The board hired more than 15,000  teachers for the summer session.</p>
        <p>Miles away, at P.S. 165 on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the principal, Irma Marzan, was stunned when Andrew C. Weidmann, a teacher, reported that only 5 of his 15 students had showed up for class.</p>
        <p>One teacher at P.S. 165, who asked to remain anonymous, said she had only a quarter of the supplies she needed. She said she had been promised ''math manipulatives,'' as the little colored blocks and tiles used to teach math are called, and picture books to help children learn to read. Neither had arrived.</p>
        <p>Several students at P.S. 25 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, said they were in classes with no air-conditioning. At P.S. 129 on 130th Street and Convent Avenue in Harlem, Shantal Lee, a fourth grader, said there were only fans in her classroom, and she not received any textbooks. Rose Garcia said her son, Elvis, a third grader at the same school, was given a notebook and work sheets, but no textbooks.</p>
        <p>At P.S. 153 in Harlem, 109 out of 392 students are missing, said the principal, Jeffrey Litt, although attendance monitors had rounded up 56 children in one day by visiting their homes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Litt said many parents had told him they were sending their children to visit grandparents in the Dominican Republic or Puerto Rico. Some parents said they were working, and could not pick up their children when the program ended at 1:45 p.m. Mr. Litt said a mother on workfare told him that she had to put her son in day care, instead of summer school, or she would lose the day care slot in the fall.</p>
        <p>''They're willing to give up a year of a child's life, and I think that's crazy,'' Mr. Litt said.</p>
        <p>Parents across the city complained that Fridays are a hardship because they have to find child care. There are no classes at most schools on Fridays, even though teachers are paid to report to work.</p>
        <p>At Walton High School in the Bronx, attendance was about 40 percent, and teachers complained that  the fans were as loud as motorcycle engines. Officials said 23 teachers failed to show up at Walton last week, and the school had to find substitutes.</p>
        <p>Amid the complaints, there were schools and districts where summer school was going smoothly.</p>
        <p>Attendance was highest in the more affluent districts, like Bayside, Queens, with 86 percent of mandatory students, and District 2, from Chinatown to the Upper East Side, with 84 percent. The worst attendance was in poor districts with low test scores, like District 7 in the Bronx, where attendance among voluntary students was 43 percent.</p>
        <p>At Middle School 118 in the East Tremont section of the Bronx, the principal, Robert Schreier, said attendance has risen to 80 percent, from 75 percent last week. He attributed the high attendance to telephone calls and meetings with parents.</p>
        <p>At M.S. 293 in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, the principal of the summer program, Paula Paterniti, said calls home has raised attendance to 85 percent from 65 percent last week.</p>
        <p>From the first day of school last Wednesday, anecdotal evidence indicated that many students were not showing up, but Mr. Levy, hoping the situation would improve, refused to release official numbers until yesterday. In the meantime, he said, school officials had made thousands of calls and visits to parents.</p>
        <p>Adding to the confusion, Mr. Levy revised the overall numbers even as he announced the shortfall. Last week, officials said there were 319,000 students enrolled in summer school, this week, the register rose to 327,000, which officials attributed to students in high schools and parochial schools who decided to enroll at the last minute. But of the new total, 197,000 were present Monday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said of the 64,000 students in grades three to eight who were mandated to attend summer school, 76 percent are in class. They will be held back if they do not pass a test at the end of the summer. The 24-percent truancy rate for the mandatory students is about the same as last summer, when a quarter of the 35,000 students required to attend summer school in grades three, six and eight failed to show up.</p>
        <p>Rudy Crew, then the chancellor, did not discover the missing students until the end of the summer, when they became a political liability and one factor in his ouster in December.</p>
        <p>Of the 107,000 students in kindergarten to eighth grade who have been urged to attend summer school voluntarily, 65 percent were in school yesterday. The voluntary students will be promoted to the next grade even if they do not attend, although they were performing in the bottom half of all students citywide last year. The worst attendance was in high school, where only 54 percent of the 157,000 students who registered were attending.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said he would ask the State Legislature to make summer school compulsory for failing students.</p>
