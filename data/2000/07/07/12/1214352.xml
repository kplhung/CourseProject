        <p>In an aggressive bid to topple the Republicans' fragile six-seat majority in the House of Representatives, House Democrats have built a substantial financial advantage over the Republicans.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had $37.4 million in the bank at the end of last month, $15.2 million more than the National Republican Congressional Committee had, according to second-quarter fund-raising reports to be filed this week at the Federal Election Commission. The gap has more than doubled since it first became apparent at the end of the last reporting period in March.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' $37.4 million is highest cash-on-hand figure in the party's history. It is 10 times the amount they had in the bank at a similar point in 1998 and 7 times as much as they had in reserves in July 1996.</p>
        <p>Although the Republicans have raised more money over all for House contests, their edge over Democrats is far less pronounced than in previous election cycles and the Democrats have husbanded their resources. Republicans, on the other hand, have spent $68 million of the $90 million raised for House races.</p>
        <p>Democratic Party officials say their financial success is partly a result of lingering anger at the impeachment of President Clinton and partly because the goal of retaking control of the House is in sight. As an example of the Democrats' newfound fund-raising prowess, a dozen nonincumbent Democratic candidates for House seats in contested districts have already raised $1 million or more for their races. At this point in 1998, no nonincumbent Democratic House candidate had raised $1 million.</p>
        <p>Analysts from both parties say 30 to 40 House races will be competitive this fall, and those races are expected to cost at least $3 million each and even more in areas where television advertising costs are high, party strategists said today.</p>
        <p>Both parties had raised record sums through June 30 for House contests, and the fast pace of fund-raising means there will be many contests in which the amount spent will swell into seven figures, numbers seen more often in Senate contests. And a recent federal appeals court ruling in Colorado has encouraged the political parties to consider ignoring federal spending limits on individual candidates' races.</p>
        <p>Two-thirds of the $60 million raised by the Democratic Party came in the form of large, unlimited contributions known as ''soft money.'' About half of the $90 million raised by the Republican Party came in large soft-money contributions. Much of the federally restricted ''hard'' money raised by Republicans comes through direct mail, a form of political fund-raising that is extremely expensive. So the Republicans have spent substantial sums raising still more money.</p>
        <p>In an effort to close the widening cash gap with Democrats, the House Republicans have started a $16 million program, named Battleground 2000. The money for the fund is being donated by Republican members of the House, from their own campaign funds, in amounts ranging from $700,000 from a few House Republican leaders to $10,000 from House freshmen. It will be spent to support Republicans who face tightly contested challenges in carefully selected districts nationwide.</p>
        <p>''We will look at each individual district and see what Republicans need most -- get out the vote campaigns, media campaigns, phone banking,'' said Marit Babin, a spokeswoman for the Republican Congressional committee.</p>
        <p>Despite the Republican push to narrow the gap, campaign finance experts say they cannot remember the last time the Democrats held such a large cash-on-hand advantage over the Republicans, who have routinely outraised the Democrats by at least 2 to 1 for many years.</p>
        <p>''The Congressional Democrats are in a far stronger financial position than the Republicans going into the general election,'' said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21 and a campaign finance expert. ''And to my knowledge, that has never happened before.''</p>
        <p>Led by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, and Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, the Democratic campaign committee has used a variety of methods to attract large donations from individuals and corporate political action committees. For example, Democrats expect to raise $1 million at an Aug. 27 fund-raiser in Newport, R.I., featuring the singer Tony Bennett. The event is being billed as a chance for big donors and corporate lobbyists to rub elbows with senior House Democrats who will become committee chairmen if the Democrats regain control of the chamber.</p>
        <p>The Democratic committee is also getting a substantial assist from Mr. Clinton, who has headlined 14 events for House candidates, raising $8.3 million. Vice President Al Gore has appeared at three major House fund-raising dinners in recent months, bringing in $3.8 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy, chairman of the Democratic House committee, said that money is flowing to House candidates in part because many donors do not believe Democrats will gain seats in the Senate and are uncertain about Mr. Gore's ability to defeat Gov. George W. Bush for the presidency.</p>
        <p>''I think we're clearly benefiting from the perception that we need to have a last line of defense,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''We need to have an insurance policy if this does not end up being a banner year for Democrats'' elsewhere on the ballot.</p>
        <p>He said that his job was to ensure that House candidates in tight races have the resources to compete, and he declared that the goal was within reach.</p>
        <p>''The way things are shaping up now,'' Mr. Kennedy said, ''we're not going to lose a single seat for lack of money.''</p>
        <p>A longtime Democratic fund-raiser also attributed the party's success to an abiding hunger to retake the House. ''We've been out six years and people are hungry,'' said the fund-raiser, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''They're anxious to get back in.''</p>
        <p>David Plouffe, the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said that donors of all kinds had helped fatten the committee's accounts. Small contributions are coming in at a record pace, he said, as well as large gifts from unions, including a $1 million check from Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union, the largest single contribution the committee had ever received.</p>
        <p>Mr. Plouffe said the committee was getting ''a lot more from the Washington corporate community'' -- meaning lobbyists -- as well as an increase in gifts from wealthy Democrats who in the past gave chiefly to presidential and Senate candidates.</p>
        <p>He also said that Democratic House members have already contributed $5 million to the committee from their own campaign accounts.</p>
        <p>Spending on House races by Republicans in particular could be increased significantly by a new campaign finance loophole that was created in May by a federal appeals court in Colorado.</p>
        <p>The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Colorado and five other Western states, struck down a 1976 federal election law that limits how much money political parties are permitted to spend directly on behalf of individual House and Senate candidates. The cap was $67,000 per House district. Although the ruling covers only six Western states, House Republican leaders and strategists are considering a plan to funnel millions of dollars to highly contested races nationwide. The decision will likely be appealed to the United States Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Since the appeals court decision, the Federal Election Commission has issued an unusual statement that warns the political parties that the $67,000 limits are still in effect.</p>
        <p>''No decision has been made,'' said Ms. Babin, the House Republican committee spokeswoman. ''Our lawyers are still looking at it.''</p>
