        <p>HarperCollins Publishers agreed yesterday to acquire Fourth Estate, a small and highly regarded British publishing house based in London, whose authors include the popular historian Dava Sobel and the novelist Annie Proulx.</p>
        <p>HarperCollins, a unit of the New York-based News Corporation, said that Fourth Estate's founder, Victoria Barnsley, would assume the title of chief executive and publisher of HarperCollins UK, the unit's British division, a position which has been vacant for several months.</p>
        <p>Fourth Estate will become an imprint of HarperCollins, continuing to publish about 100 books a year. The new imprint will also begin publishing titles in the United States.</p>
        <p>Jane Friedman, president and chief executive of HarperCollins Publishers, said the deal served the dual purposes of recruiting Ms. Barnsley to head the British division and continuing an effort to expand HarperCollins. She said the company had made a series of recent acquisitions, including Echo Press, a publisher of literature in the United States. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>The acquisition raised questions in publishing circles on both sides of the Atlantic because Fourth Estate was planning to publish an unauthorized biography of the News Corporation's chairman, Rupert Murdoch, by Michael Crick, an outspoken British author and soccer enthusiast who has criticized Mr. Murdoch in the past.</p>
        <p>When another of Mr. Murdoch's businesses, the satellite television company BSkyB, sought unsuccessfully to acquire control of the soccer team Manchester United, Mr. Crick led an organization of the team's fans opposed to the deal. ''It is a strange coincidence,'' Ms. Friedman said, adding that the company understood that in light of the ''awkward situation'' the author might want another publisher for his biography of Mr. Murdoch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crick could not be reached for comment, but his wife said he expected to negotiate an agreement with Fourth Estate, allowing him to publish elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Fourth Estate was one of the last prominent independent publishers in Britain, along with Bloomsbury Press and Faber &amp; Faber.</p>
