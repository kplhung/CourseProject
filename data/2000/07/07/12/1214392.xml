        <p>Derek Jeter tucked his jersey into his uniform pants and listed the people who were at the All-Star Game to watch him start for the American League tonight. Jeter mentioned his parents, his sister and three of his friends from New York, shaking his head as he talked about securing enough decent tickets. But Jeter should not have stopped his list at six people.</p>
        <p>Besides Jeter's family and friends, there were 51,317 other fans who were at Turner Field to watch him, too. It happened that way because a game that was missing marquee players like Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr., Alex Rodriguez and Pedro Martinez, and was being called the All-Scar Game, developed into another enticing stage for the amazing Jeter.</p>
        <p>Jeter stroked three hits, knocked in two runs and scored one run to power the American League past the National League, 6-3, and become the first Yankee to win the most valuable player award in the All-Star Game. Manager Joe Torre chose his shortstop as the starter after Rodriguez sustained a concussion last Friday, and Jeter poked a two-run single off the Mets' Al Leiter in the fourth inning to break a 1-1 tie in helping the A.L. win the game for the fourth straight year.</p>
        <p>''You have to play a lot of years before you can be considered a Yankee great, and I've only played four years,'' Jeter said. ''This is my fifth year. Hopefully, I can play a few more years and start that debate.''</p>
        <p>The debate has already started. Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Reggie Jackson, Thurman Munson, Dave Winfield, Reggie Jackson, Don Mattingly, Rickey Henderson, Paul O'Neill and Mariano Rivera have all played in All-Star Games as Yankees since the M.V.P. was first given in 1962, but none ever won what Jeter did tonight. The National Baseball Hall of Fame took Jeter's black Louisville Slugger P72 bat that he used for all three hits back to Cooperstown, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''Right now, I'm very happy, obviously,'' Jeter said. ''But I think in due time, when I sit down and get a chance to reflect on it, then you realize how special it is. And I wasn't aware that no other Yankee had won this award, and it's kind of hard to believe.''</p>
        <p>The fans lined up outside Turner Field early on a steamy day. Some had their tickets, some were searching for tickets, and most were eager to watch the finest players in baseball. Well, they were eager to see most of the best players in baseball. The list of injured players was stunning for its size and stature.</p>
        <p>Players like McGwire, Griffey, Rodriguez, Martinez, Cal Ripken Jr., Mike Piazza, Barry Bonds and Greg Maddux are not once-in-a-lifetime All-Stars. They are future Hall of Famers and the type of players fans thirst to watch. But all eight, plus Manny Ramirez, were spectators, and that seemed odd. Atlanta's Bobby Cox, the National League manager, lamented that some fans would not get to see ''their heroes and superstars.''</p>
        <p>But there were still plenty of stars here tonight and plenty of excellent performances. Jeter doubled in the first, the only blemish off Randy Johnson in Johnson's eight-pitch cruise through his only inning. David Wells was crisper as he whiffed two in two shutout innings, throwing 23 of his 27 pitches for strikes and then hanging out with his 8-year-old son, Brandon, in the dugout.</p>
        <p>''Well, I enjoy the spotlight for the fact that I'm afraid to fail,'' Wells said. ''I want to be the hero.''</p>
        <p>So did Jeter. The A.L. loaded the bases against Leiter on a walk, Travis Fryman's single and Barry Larkin's error in the fourth. With one out, Jeter, the Yankee, faced Leiter, the Met. The two had opposed each other last Friday when the Yankees beat the Mets, 2-1, at Shea Stadium, but both claimed they did not think about facing a fellow New York player.</p>
        <p>Jeter had spoken to Roberto Alomar earlier in the game about trying to resist swinging at Leiter's cut fastball, a pitch that starts out over the plate and dives in hard on right-handed hitters. Leiter threw the cutter on the first pitch. Jeter could not resist, and he blooped it over Larkin at shortstop for a two-run single that put the A.L. ahead to stay, making the score 3-1.</p>
        <p>''I didn't hit it well,'' said Jeter, who had struck out in his other two All-Star at-bats in 1998 and 1999 before tonight. ''I just hit it in the right place.''</p>
        <p>Leiter, who was the losing pitcher, said: ''He pulled his hands back and managed to hit it far enough. It's a line drive in the box score.''</p>
        <p>Kevin Brown, the N.L.'s third pitcher, had scant control as the A.L. took a 1-0 lead in the third. After Jim Edmonds sprinted to the center-field warning track and made a gorgeous basket catch on Mike Bordick's 395-foot fly ball, Brown looked lost. The $105 million pitcher with the mean streak had a wild streak as he walked Alomar, permitted Jeter's single, walked Jason Giambi and walked Carl Everett to force in a run.</p>
        <p>In the bottom of the third, Chipper Jones quickly equaled the score when he belted James Baldwin's 2-0 fastball to left-center field for a homer. Since Jones was playing on his home field in Atlanta, he rounded the bases with a huge smile and pointed to the fans behind the plate when he scored. Jones became the 13th All-Star to rip a homer in his own ballpark.</p>
        <p>''It was awesome,'' Jones said. ''I mean, it's every little boy's dream.''</p>
        <p>It looked as if Jones might be tonight's hero, especially when he had one of the three singles off Oakland's Jason Isringhausen to chisel the deficit to 3-2 in the fifth. But Isringhausen retired Sammy Sosa and Jeff Kent to preserve a one-run lead and ensure that Jeter would be the most valuable player on this starry night.</p>
        <p>''You get butterflies before the game,'' Jeter said. ''It's a situation where you've got the best players in baseball here. You want to have fun, but you also want to do well. But the No. 1 priority, I think, is just to come out here and give the fans a good show.''</p>
