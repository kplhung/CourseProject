        <p>Clifton Richards was more than just a mailroom clerk. He tackled the phones, mastered new software and bought supplies at the Social Science Research Council, a nonprofit foundation where he worked in Manhattan. Always friendly, invariably dependable, he seemed to be a true asset, his co-workers say. He even dressed better than many of the staff, they say.</p>
        <p>Then, $650,000 in checks turned up missing over three months, the foundation says, and the United States Postal Police were called in to investigate. In March, Mr. Richards was charged with bank fraud, accused of stealing 22 grant payments from the company's mail and pawning them off to an intermediary for pennies on the dollar. (Efforts to reach him or his lawyer for comment were unsuccessful.)</p>
        <p>Now, the shaken managers of the foundation are setting up security protocols they never knew they needed. ''It's analogous to what one would do when someone burglarizes your home,'' said Craig Calhoun, the president. ''You change the locks; you put in a burglary system. But that doesn't mean you're invulnerable or can stop this from happening again.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, in enterprises of all sizes and shapes, from shoestring nonprofits to giant corporations, the scale of employee theft has soared. Spurred by the gold-rush mentality of the late 1990's, emboldened by technology and quick to prey on the loose financial controls at start-ups and small companies, workers at every rung of the corporate ladder are stealing more money than ever before, fraud examiners say.</p>
        <p>Though it is unclear how much the number of incidents has grown, a 1998 survey of 5,000 businesses, government agencies and nonprofits calculated an average loss of $624,000 from check fraud by employees, including forgeries and mailroom theft, nearly twice the figure in a 1994 poll. The survey, by consultants for KPMG, the accounting firm, also found that the looting of company bank accounts by employees using A.T.M. cards had more than doubled, to an average of $300,000.</p>
        <p>Theft and misuse of company credit cards by employees tripled, to an average loss of more than $1.1 million, from 1994 to 1998, the KPMG survey showed. And the average loss from employee expense account abuse grew to $141,000, nearly seven times what it was four years earlier.</p>
        <p>Fraud investigators say these statistics only scratch the surface of a surge in workplace larceny. Anonymous surveys are one thing. But, fearful of bad publicity, companies are loath to report theft cases to law enforcement, masking a problem that has grown alongside the soaring economy.</p>
        <p>''In the early 1980's, when I first started in this business, I was not a very busy person,'' said Toby Bishop, a partner in the fraud division at Arthur Andersen, the consulting firm. ''Today, I can't handle all of what comes in the door.''</p>
        <p>When the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, which is based in Austin, Tex., conducted one of the nation's first comprehensive studies on employee fraud in 1996, it reported that companies typically lost 6 percent of their annual revenues to such theft, roughly twice most earlier estimates.</p>
        <p>Two years later, in a survey of 587 fraud examiners, nearly 70 percent said that fraud levels had increased since the initial report and that they expected the trend to continue.</p>
        <p>Fraud examiners attribute much of the recent wave of office criminality to the stock market boom that has created hordes of overnight millionaires and stirred impatience with the occasional pay raise.</p>
        <p>''You see the guy down the street who cashed in his stock options and is now worth a million dollars, and you're still making $30,000,'' said John Warren, general counsel of the fraud examiners' group. ''It makes it easier to rationalize fraudulent behavior.''</p>
        <p>Then there is the widening gap between executive and worker compensation. Edward Wolff, an economics professor at New York University, says corporate chief executives made an average 400 times what their average employees did in 1998, up from a ratio of just 40 a decade earlier. The disparity in pay has fueled discontent and eroded loyalty to such a degree that stealing on the job is often seen as acceptable behavior, fraud investigators say.</p>
        <p>''It used to be extremely rare that anyone would acknowledge theft taking place,'' said Jim Baker, founder and president of Baker Technologies Inc. in Rowlett, Tex., who has been investigating fraud for 30 years. ''Now it's rare that we don't hear of someone knowing about it. People have a cavalier attitude. There's no shame attached to theft.''</p>
        <p>One consequence of the growth in such theft has been a large gain in the number of fraud investigators. Membership in the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, the principal professional group, has increased to about 25,000 from about 8,200 in 1992.</p>
        <p>''They see it as a growth industry,'' Mr. Warren, the general counsel, said.</p>
        <p>Stealing often starts in the mailroom, a favorite haunt of unscrupulous employees, investigators say. ''When you get a new employee, where do you stick them? The mailroom,'' said Patrick Casey, a federal postal inspector and spokesman for the postal police. ''That's often the lowest-paying job in the corporation, yet a lot of the company's money goes through there. Criminals sometimes seek out those jobs because they realize they will have access to the ingoing and the outbound checks.''</p>
        <p>But workplace theft is costliest when committed by high-ranking employees, who tend to have the most access to funds. According to the fraud examiners' association, the median loss from crimes by managers is $250,000, four times that of crimes by employees. And the median loss from owners and executives is $1 million, 16 times that of their employees.</p>
        <p>In some ways, workplace thieves have become easier to catch. Technology has expanded the arsenal of video cameras, decoys and other tools used by fraud investigators. But computers, modems and the Internet also offer employees new ways of tampering with financial records, transferring funds and covering their tracks.</p>
        <p>''It's a double-edged sword,'' said Bill Olsen, the mid-Atlantic director for business fraud and investigation at Arthur Andersen. ''With the same technology we're using to detect and deter fraud, there are people out there who are using it to commit crimes.''</p>
        <p>Many investigators also worry that a growing inattention to the issue is making it easier for employees to steal. As labor shortages threaten rapid growth, companies are becoming more likely to forgo thorough background checks so as to speed up hiring.</p>
        <p>And with the pressure to post record earnings quarter after quarter, many businesses have cut back on departments like accounting and security that help detect theft but do not generate revenue. Start-ups, racing to post profits, are particularly short on checks and balances.</p>
        <p>''Internal controls are still very much viewed as cost centers,'' said Richard H. Girgenti, director of investigations at KPMG. ''What doesn't dawn on management is the connection between money spent on fraud protection and the bottom line.''</p>
        <p>Still, even the most elaborate safeguards can fail. The Social Science Research Council says, for example, that Mr. Richards came from an employee agency that professed to do background checks. The foundation itself has five accountants in a staff of just 50, an unusually high ratio, even in the private sector.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richards has yet to stand trial on the federal charges. The complaint says that he admitted taking the checks and that a teller at Chase Manhattan Bank approved cashing them. Investigators say they suspect that the teller deposited the stolen checks in false accounts. The bank said it was looking into the matter and would reimburse the foundation if any wrongdoing was uncovered.</p>
        <p>The foundation said it did not know anything was amiss until students who had been awarded research grants started calling from schools around the world, asking when the money would arrive. Then it took weeks to track down the source of the thefts.</p>
        <p>''The scariest thing is that we kept watching it happen and it kept coming,'' said Kristine Dahlberg, the foundation's chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>Inadequate staffing and an atmosphere of trust often make nonprofits susceptible to theft, but investigators say that most fraud still occurs at corporations, large and small, where money and opportunities for fraud abound.</p>
        <p>Many regard the ever-increasing trend toward corporate mergers as a prime opportunity for white-collar criminals. ''When merging with companies that have different profiles, management's eyes are off the ball,'' said David Sherwin, a partner with Ernst &amp; Young who oversees the company's fraud surveys. ''There is no real status quo anymore. The old benchmarks are no longer valid, so it becomes easy for fraud to go undetected.''</p>
        <p>Steve Albrecht, associate dean at the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young University, says that in his consultations with national banks, he noticed fraud levels rising 33 percent a year from 1996 to 1998. As huge mergers become common and layoffs ensue, Mr. Albrecht said, employees cease to identify with the companies they work for, developing a sense of detachment that makes theft simpler to justify.</p>
        <p>''Employees are not viewed as long-term investments; they're viewed as short-term assets that can be bought and sold,'' Mr. Albrecht said. ''As a result, there's not the allegiance to the organization that there used to be.''</p>
