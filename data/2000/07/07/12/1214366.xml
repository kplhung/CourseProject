        <p>Two clients of Mullen Advertising are undertaking account reviews.</p>
        <p>Monster.com, the Internet job- search Web site operated by TMP Worldwide, is unexpectedly reviewing its American account, with billings estimated at $75 million to $90 million, after two years at Mullen. The agency created a hugely successful Super Bowl commercial last year for Monster.com, featuring youngsters complaining about dead-end jobs.</p>
        <p>Jeff Taylor, chief executive at Monster.com in Maynard, Mass., attributed the review to a need ''to look at some larger-agency capabilities.'' Kitty Bartholomew, a spokeswoman for Mullen, said the agency planned to participate in the review; though Mullen has only one office, it has a parent with worldwide resources, the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>The larger agencies that work for Monster.com around the world include Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, for Europe, and Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide, a Mullen sibling, for Asia and Australia.</p>
        <p>Skip Pile, chairman and chief executive at Pile &amp; Company in Boston, which is managing the review, said four finalists would be chosen in early September, with a decision planned for later that month.</p>
        <p>The other review is being started by L. L. Bean, the apparel retailer, after Bean and Mullen issued a statement announcing that they had parted ways after two years. Bean's billings were estimated at $20 million to $25 million.</p>
        <p>Richard Donaldson, a spokesman for Bean in Freeport, Me., called the review a reassessment ''across all our sales and marketing channels.'' Mr. Pile, whose company is also handling the Bean review, said three finalists would be selected in September, with a decision that month.</p>
