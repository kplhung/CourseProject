        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average rose for a third consecutive session yesterday, lifted by continued good earnings news from old-line cyclical companies and optimism that the Federal Reserve may have finished raising interest rates.</p>
        <p>Led by International Paper, which reported better-than-expected second-quarter results yesterday, and Alcoa, which beat Wall Street estimates on Monday, the Dow gained 80.61 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,727.19.</p>
        <p>''International Paper and Alcoa sort of set the tone and brought back a lot of the cyclical areas of the market,'' said James Paulson, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management. ''Technology stocks faded late in the day, but by and large most of the market was pretty strong.''</p>
        <p>Strength in cyclical stocks as well as good performances from drug, oil services and integrated oil companies led the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, which rose 5.26 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,480.88.</p>
        <p>Technology stocks did not fare so well.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index fell 23.87 points, or 0.6 percent, to 3,956.42. JDS Uniphase, which fell for a second consecutive day, and Yahoo were among the biggest losers.</p>
        <p>Worries about second-quarter earnings helped to drag Yahoo down 4 1/2, to 105 1/2. But after the market closed, the company reported earnings that beat Wall Street estimates. After hours, Yahoo rebounded and traded as high as 114.</p>
        <p>International Paper was among the best-performing Dow stocks. It surged 3 5/16, to 35 1/4. And Alcoa rose for a second consecutive session, closing at 32 1/2, up 2 13/16.</p>
        <p>''Concern about an unfriendly Fed is persistently coming out of the market,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''That is causing investors to show interest in rate-sensitive areas like papers, chemicals, metals and autos.''</p>
        <p>Financial service stocks, which would also stand to benefit if the Fed stopped raising interest rates, also did well yesterday.</p>
        <p>Citigroup rose  3/4, to 66. Merrill Lynch gained 2 13/16, to 129. And Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette rose 2 1/8, to 47 1/2.</p>
        <p>Integrated oil and oil services stocks did well after BP Amoco announced a sharp increase in capital spending for the next three years.</p>
        <p>Schlumberger, a chief supplier to BP Amoco, gained 6 5/64, to 74 61/64. Halliburton rose 4 49/64, to 46 49/64. And Baker Hughes gained 3 13/16, to 34 3/16.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Mixed</p>
        <p>By Reuters</p>
        <p>Treasury bond prices were mixed yesterday after a speech by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, offered nothing hawkish on interest rates.</p>
        <p>The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, to 103 9/32. The note's yield was unchanged at 6.04 percent.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond remained at 105 5/32, and its yield stayed at 5.88 percent.</p>
