        <p>The former president of a union local testified yesterday that Dennis Sullivan, the chief negotiator for District Council 37, the union of municipal workers, helped rig the union's 1995 contract ratification vote.</p>
        <p>The testimony from the former president, Gary R. Tenenbaum, rocked the Manhattan courtroom where two former top officials of the union are on trial on charges of vote fraud. Mr. Sullivan is so respected that the union leader brought in from Washington to clean up the district council named Mr. Sullivan as one of his deputy trustees.</p>
        <p>Chris Policano, a council spokesman, said last night that Mr. Sullivan denied all the allegations. And Lee Saunders, the trustee running District Council 37, said: ''These are allegations that we're hearing for the first time. The testimony given by Tenenbaum today completely contradicts what he told our professional in-house investigation in the course of their investigation of the ratification vote and is not supported by any evidence we have uncovered. Obviously they are serious allegations, and if they prove to be true we will take appropriate action.''</p>
        <p>Ever since the the huge embezzlement and vote-rigging scandal at District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees became public two years ago, resulting in more than two dozen indictments or guilty pleas, Mr. Sullivan has remained in a prominent position in the council, helping lead efforts to negotiate a new contract with the Giuliani administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan is one of the closest aides to Mr. Saunders, who has run the council since November 1998. Mr. Sullivan had also been the right-hand man of the council's former executive director, Stanley Hill, who was forced out in disgrace in November 1998. Mr. Hill and Mr. Sullivan are  among the few former top council officials not to be indicted. The council is an umbrella group representing 56 union locals and 125,000 workers.</p>
        <p>On Monday, prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's office began to lay out their vote fraud case against two who had been among the council's most powerful leaders: Albert A. Diop, the former president of a union local representing 24,000 city administrative assistants, and Martin Lubin, the council's former No. 2 official.</p>
        <p>In testimony yesterday, John McCabe, former director of District Council 37's white-collar division, and Mr. Tenenbaum, former president of a local representing recreation workers, directly tied Mr. Lubin to the vote fraud, saying he was occasionally in the room where ballots were being tampered with. So far there has been less testimony tying Mr. Diop to the vote fraud.</p>
        <p>Union officials who have pleaded guilty have admitted to throwing out hundreds of no votes and writing yes votes on ballots to ensure approval of the 1995 contract. The five-year agreement included a highly unpopular two-year wage freeze as well as a three-year promise of no layoffs and a 12 percent raise in the contract's last three years.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Mr. Lubin and Mr. Diop insisted that their clients were innocent, saying that people who had already pleaded guilty to participating in the fraud had implicated their clients to win lighter sentences.</p>
        <p>In another surprise in the courtroom yesterday, Mr. Tenenbaum acknowledged taking part in the vote fraud, saying Mr. Lubin and Mr. Sullivan had told him to greatly exaggerate the number of members who voted yes in a voice vote at a meeting of his union local.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors revealed that Mr. Tenenbaum, a former member of the executive council's board, had recently pleaded guilty to vote fraud  and would be sentenced to six months in prison and five years of probation. Mr. Tenenbaum has also admitted to fabricating and inflating expense reimbursement vouchers.</p>
        <p>Jane Tully, one of the prosecutors, said the council had a long history of vote fraud, dating to at least 1992. She said that one union official who had pleaded guilty acknowledged rigging elections at union locals for $1 a vote. If a candidate for a local's presidency needed 300 fake votes to win, the price would be $300, she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCabe, the former official who has pleaded guilty to vote fraud, testified that the presidents of seven or eight union locals had bowed to pressures from top union officials to rig the vote count to help rescue the  five-year contract and save Mr. Hill from embarrassment.</p>
