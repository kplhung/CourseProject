        <p>China Looks to Pick Up Reform Pace  Though China has been marching famously on the road toward economic change for more than two decades, barriers to capital formation keep most private businesses from providing more than a handful of jobs.

Dollens, chief executive of Guidant, says he learned life's lessons from his father during drives to and from work at the family grocery store: ''He taught me about integrity and respecting people no matter what their stature. He had a wallhanging in the kitchen: 'Don't try to teach a pig to sing. It wastes your time and annoys the pig.' I have that saying framed in my office. It reminds me that you have to start with a certain amount of capability or you're pretty limited in what you can do.'' The Boss. [C8.]</p>

        <p>Profit Triples at International Paper  International Paper, the maker of paper and forest products, said that its second-quarter profit more than tripled as a result of higher prices and cost-cutting.
