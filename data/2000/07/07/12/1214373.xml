        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While I applaud your effort to keep our high-tech economy moving along by recommending that Congress raise the H-1B visa cap to ease the high-tech worker shortage (editorial, July 5), I am sorry that you do not recommend the retraining of American workers to help ease the shortage. High-tech companies are very quick to demand new bodies to help fuel their growth, but they are very slow to retrain (or train, for that matter) the many underemployed (or unemployed) people who live and work near these businesses.</p>
