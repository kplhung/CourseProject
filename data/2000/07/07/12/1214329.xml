        <p>For years, Southern California has been engaged in an epic pollution battle, the struggle to get rid of the brown smog that hangs over the skyline on a hot summer day.</p>
        <p>Now the region is caught in another struggle that will provide a new test of its political will and the social conscience of its residents: rethinking a system that dumps nearly a trillion gallons of polluted urban runoff each year into the ocean alongside some of Southern California's most fabled beaches.</p>
        <p>In the dry summer months, Southern California's beaches are considered among the cleanest in the nation, with pollution concentrated near storm drain outlets and in the protected coves preferred by mothers and their children.</p>
        <p>But during winter rains, the region's entire coast suffers. Beaches that attract some 50 million visitors annually become off-limits as storm drainage races to the ocean, bringing with it the waste of everyday life, from cigarette butts to oil, lawn fertilizer, human waste and animal feces.</p>
        <p>The outcome here is expected to be a test for the rest of the nation. The pollution of coastal waters has reached a crucial stage, with beach closures last year reported from Huntington Beach, Calif., to Key West, Fla., to Southern New England.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the pollution caused by runoff in Southern California is not a new problem. Indeed, it is a function of the way the region developed its storm system, a network of concrete waterways designed to avert flooding by directing runoff to the ocean.</p>
        <p>But rampant development and increased water testing that revealed the extent of the problem and the related health risks are raising the level of debate among environmental advocates, state and local officials and the federal government.</p>
        <p>Experts predict that solving the problem will cost billions of dollars and will rival the efforts to control smog.</p>
        <p>With pressure for a solution mounting, Congress is considering legislation that would require water testing and the posting of unsafe conditions at beaches nationwide.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has already established minimum quality standards for recreational waters and has developed a program, still in its infancy, to give the public access to water-quality information.</p>
        <p>In California, Gov. Gray Davis recently provided an additional $5 million for jobs to help enforce regulations regarding discharges and polluted runoff, while public awareness campaigns urge residents to think twice before pouring something  down their gutters.</p>
        <p>''What we need more than anything else is a real sea change of people's understanding of the problem,'' said David Beckman, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Southern California. ''It's about the environment and public health, and if you don't care about those two things, it's about your wallet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Beckman likens storm drains to ''bazookas pointed at the ocean'' bombarding swimmers and surfers with bacteria and other pollutants. From Ventura to the Mexican border, the volume of runoff grew to nearly a trillion gallons annually in 1995 from 65 billion gallons a year in 1972, said the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project, a consortium of sanitation districts and regulators.</p>
        <p>A 1996 study by the University of Southern California and the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project of 17,000 people found that people who swam near a storm drain were 50 to 150 percent more likely to report  symptoms like fever, diarrhea, nausea and upper respiratory ailments than those swimming farther away.</p>
        <p>But as the problem worsens, environmental groups say government agencies are not enforcing regulations that would limit it. The resources defense council, a nonprofit environmental group, has petitioned the E.P.A. to force the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board to enforce regulations regarding discharges or be removed from its role as overseer.</p>
        <p>''The Clean Water Act requires big cities, large industrial entities and large construction sites to comply with storm water regulations, but noncompliance is rampant,'' Mr. Beckman said.</p>
        <p>Alexis Strauss, the director of the E.P.A.'s water division for the Western states, said the governor's approval of $5 million for additional manpower for the water quality  boards would probably help resolve the defense council's concerns in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Of the 150 employees on the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, 7 work in the storm water program, overseeing some 3,500 industrial operations, 96 cities and 2 counties plus construction sites.</p>
        <p>''We have taken every effort to deal with storm water pollution commensurate with our capability,'' said Dennis Dickerson, executive officer for the control board.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dickerson noted that the board established measures to limit litter discharge and has increased its efforts to enforce municipal permits on runoff levels. In January, the board approved stricter standards that would force builders to install abatement measures in many commercial projects.</p>
        <p>But the new standards are being challenged by a number of cities, builders and oil companies.</p>
        <p>Richard Montevideo, who represents 32 of the 33 cities in Los Angeles County that have challenged the regulations, said they were poorly written, not well researched and might hold unknown dangers for the environment.</p>
        <p>The regulations require new development projects to filter or treat the first three-quarters of an inch of runoff in a 24-hour period. The standard is written to include projects like commercial developments of more than 100,000 square feet, gasoline stations, auto repair shops and developments of more than 10 houses. But, Mr. Montevideo said, the wording would also seem to make the rules apply to some homeowners -- specifically those on hillsides or those living in environmentally sensitive areas -- if they make improvements.</p>
        <p>He also said the new regulations would hamper the development of low-to-moderate income housing because of the cost involved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montevideo, who also represents building-industry groups, wants the state water board to consider a less restrictive program.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles, Santa Monica and West Hollywood have all endorsed the new standards, and several innovative projects to address the problem are in place or in the works. For example, Los Angeles County has established diversions affecting five drains where polluted runoff is a problem. During dry weather the runoff is first channeled into sewage treatment plants.</p>
        <p>The county is also using nets and other barriers to collect trash that flows into drains and has spent $5 million in the last four years to educate residents about how they can help eliminate the problem.</p>
        <p>In Santa Monica projects include a $10 million recycling plant that will treat the water and then pump it for use irrigating parks and street medians.</p>
        <p>While such projects provide alternatives in dry weather, the solution for handling runoff in wet weather remains elusive.</p>
        <p>Whatever the outcome of the debate, the Los Angeles region is at  ground zero for the runoff issue, which exists nationwide.</p>
        <p>''We're seeing the effects of runoff pollution at beaches all across the country,'' said Kelli McGee, coastal programs counsel with the American Oceans Campaign, which is dedicated to preserving oceans and coastal habitat.</p>
        <p>Quantifying the problem, Ms. McGee said, is difficult because only 10 states have monitoring programs.</p>
        <p>The House has passed a bill that would require coastal states to establish minimum standards for water quality, monitor them and post when levels exceed safe levels. A similar bill is working its way through the Senate.</p>
        <p>The federal legislation is modeled after a California bill passed in 1997 that required testing of water for bacteria at beaches with 50,000 visitors a year between April and October and required warnings when bacteria reached a certain level.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles region is problematic because storm water systems are separate from sewage systems. This is to prevent the torrential rains, which typically occur during the winter, from overwhelming sewage treatment systems.</p>
        <p>In the Los Angeles area, with some 10 million residents living in what amounts to a concrete bowl that slopes toward the ocean, rainfall is directed into paved rivers and creeks that force the water to the ocean. But along with that water comes every piece of garbage and a variety of pollutants left behind on streets.</p>
        <p>''That, in a nutshell, is the problem,'' Mr. Beckman said.</p>
        <p>The pollution problem is most prevalent in the winter when rains are heaviest. That fact is best illustrated by the annual report done by Heal the Bay, a group that for 10 years has issued a review of water quality at the beaches. Of the 263 beaches reviewed this year, 174 or 66 percent received an A, for excellent water quality in dry weather. In wet weather, that figured dropped significantly, with only 25 percent of the beaches receiving an A or a B for excellent to good water quality during weather.</p>
        <p>Although the problem is worse during the winter months, it still occurs during the summer. Much of Huntington Beach was closed to swimming from July 1 through Labor Day last year because of high bacteria counts. The cause is still unknown, but investigators have zeroed in on runoff.</p>
        <p>And beaches geared for children, many of which are near storm drains and in calmer waters, tend to be a problem year-round. Mother's Beach in Marina del Rey, for example, is routinely declared unfit for swimming.</p>
        <p>While strides are being made to divert or treat runoff during the summer, solutions are nonexistent for the winter months.</p>
        <p>Charles Moore, a surfer for more than 40 years who operates a boat for microbiological testing, is aware of what lurks in the waters. But he does not always heed the warnings. Recently, Mr. Moore got a painful lesion he believes was the result of surfing in contaminated waters at Seal Beach in Orange County.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore and four companions all got sore throats. A boil developed on Mr. Moore's forearm, which had to be treated with antibiotics. The problem worsened until he had to be hospitalized for treatment of a streptococcus infection, which he said doctors diagnosed as a form of flesh- eating virus.</p>
        <p>While no one can be certain whether the infection was related to surfing in polluted waters, Mr. Moore -- who has surfed in the area for 42 years -- believes it was and will not take chances again.</p>
        <p>''What I have to do after this enormous trauma is stay very wary and very concerned about discharges,'' he said. ''It hurts because this is my home. This is my roots, my ocean, my bay, my river mouth. It's legend with surfers. Now that's been taken away.''</p>
