        <p>THE THIRD PARTIES</p>
        <p>NADER IS MINNESOTA-BOUND  Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota has become a must stop on the campaign circuit of presidential contenders. So it should not be a surprise that Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee, plans to come calling on Mr. Ventura on Friday. Mr. Nader said he had asked for a meeting with Mr. Ventura because he had ''a lot of ideas for him as governor.'' Mr. Nader also wants to seek Mr. Ventura's counsel on ballot access matters and on finding his way into the presidential debates. Does Mr. Nader want an endorsement, too? He said that he never asked for endorsements and that Mr. Ventura was not about to make one. But, he said, ''you don't have to leap a chasm of logic to realize I'd like that.''</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>ALLUSIONS TO CAMPAIGNS PAST  The year 1948 has suddenly loomed large in the presidential race. It began when the Bush campaign turned to Senator Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican, to blunt Al Gore's efforts to look Trumanesque as he attacks Congress as a ''do-nothing-for-people'' legislature. The long-serving Mr. Thurmond noted in a statement issued by the Bush campaign that he had actually campaigned for president against Harry S. Truman. ''Mr. Gore, I knew Harry Truman. I ran against Harry Truman. And Mr. Gore, you are no Harry Truman,'' Mr. Thurmond said, paraphrasing a line that Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, used against his opponent, Dan Quayle, in 1988. Democrats quickly noted that Mr. Thurmond ran against Truman in 1948 as a segregationist Dixiecrat. And they pointed out that the statement was released on the same day that Mr. Bush was appearing before the N.A.A.C.P. and speaking of bettering relations between Republicans and black voters. ''Political doublespeak, thy name is George W. Bush,'' said Jenny Backus, the press secretary for the Democratic National Committee.</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>THE RIDGE FACTOR FOR BUSH  A new poll in Pennsylvania shows that Gov. George W. Bush would benefit significantly in that important state if he added Gov. Tom Ridge to his ticket. The Keystone Poll, conducted by the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville University, shows a statistical dead heat in a head-to-head contest, with Mr. Bush at 44 percent and Mr. Gore at 40 percent. The survey of 634 registered voters has a sampling error of plus or minus four points. If Mr. Ridge is added to the Republican ticket, Mr. Bush's lead would extend to 51 percent to 39 percent, beyond the margin of error.</p>
