        <p>EVERY long road trip has at least one variation on this scene:</p>
        <p>Lunchtime. Two hundred miles to go. Everyone is hungry, the children are fighting in the back seat, the only FM station within range is called Lite 101, and the open road stretches ahead like a long afternoon of Kenny G.

        <p>EVERY long road trip has at least one variation on this scene:</p>
        <p>Lunchtime. Two hundred miles to go. Everyone is hungry, the children are fighting in the back seat, the only FM station within range is called Lite 101, and the open road stretches ahead like a long afternoon of Kenny G. Exit 57 beckons in the distance. The FOOD PHONE GAS LODGING sign mentions two fast-food places and a ''family restaurant.'' This is hardly promising, but you might as well pull off, right?</p>
        <p>Not necessarily. It is possible to eat well on the road, or better than well. With a little homework before you set out, you may be able to find out that terrific barbecued pork lies in wait just 3.2 miles south of Exit 57, or that fluffy plate-size pancakes with home-canned blueberry sauce are served in a diner just outside the state park.</p>
        <p>There's no denying that America has been paved with look-alike fast-food restaurants since the building of the Interstate highway system in the 1950's and 60's. But this onslaught has by no means wiped out the kinds of places that serve authentic American food: Philadelphia cheese steak, Gulf Coast oysters, Michigan cherry pie.</p>
        <p>''Even though franchise food has spread like the plague,'' said Michael Stern, the author, with his wife, Jane Stern, of the guidebook ''Eat Your Way Across the U.S.A.'' (Broadway Books, 1999), ''the regional food we delight in finding is still very healthy and thriving.''</p>
        <p>And the search for places that serve such food has gotten easier, thanks to the rise of another kind of superhighway -- the electronic one. The suggestions that follow have been gleaned not only from guidebooks and interviews, but also from the Internet, where a community of devoted (not to say fanatical) eaters has gathered, happy to pass along tips, finds and information.</p>
        <p>GUIDEBOOKS -- ''Eat Your Way Across the U.S.A.'' is the latest in a series of books by the Sterns that are still the gold standard of this genre. The couple, both 53, have been at it since the mid-1970's, and by now they say they have driven three million miles and eaten in tens of thousands of restaurants. The current book lists about 500.</p>
        <p>The prose in ''Eat Your Way'' is at best workmanlike, but the descriptions are evocative and the couple's enthusiasm is undiminished after all these years. By zeroing in on regional food, the Sterns avoid a serious weakness of more traditional guidebooks like the AAA Guides, the Mobil Travel Guides and the Frommer's America on Wheels series, which tend to tilt toward the comfortable, predictable and expensive.</p>
        <p>But their book has limitations. It has rough maps, but no driving directions; you will have to call ahead (not a bad idea in any event). More important, even with 500 listings, it covers only a small fraction of what is out there. Western Massachusetts, for example, is a desert to the Sterns.</p>
        <p>Virtually every region has dining guidebooks that can be found in local bookstores. Who could resist a title like ''A Locals' Guide to South Carolina's Best-Kept Dining Secrets'' (by Brian Katonak and Lynne Katonak; Sandlapper Publishing, 1999)? Or ''Diners of Pennsylvania'' (Brian A. Butko and Kevin Joseph Patrick; Stackpole Books, 1999)? And it is worth asking whether the region you'll be visiting is covered by the Zagat Surveys. These tall, thin green- or burgundy-colored volumes, with their capsule reviews supplied by readers, are mainly limited to large cities, but where they do exist they are useful and comprehensive.</p>
        <p>ON THE WEB -- The Zagat Surveys are available at www.zagat.com, and the Sterns have just started a Web site, at www.roadfood .com. Most newspapers have Web sites, many with archives of local restaurant reviews. But www.chowhound.com leaves all of these sites in the dust.</p>
        <p>The heart of Chowhound.com is a set of  message boards on which visitors can post queries or comments to which other visitors can respond, creating DNA-like strands of messages on topics like where to eat in the Finger Lakes, where to find Russian cooking in New Jersey and the merits of a restaurant called the Old Heidelberg in South Warsaw, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''This is exactly why I built the site,'' said Jim Leff, a 37-year-old jazz trombonist from Jackson Heights, Queens, who started Chowhound.com in 1997 and says it now receives 24,000 hits a day. ''As a user, I just love being able to say, 'Listen, I'm going to Baltimore; where's the real place for crab?' You'll get the guys who've tried all 95 crab places and really, really know.''</p>
        <p>FOLLOWING YOUR NOSE -- No guidebook can cover every Interstate exit. Surfing the Web is not an option at 65 miles an hour. And whether in print or in cyberspace, any set of restaurant listings begs the question: How did you find them in the first place? If all you have is your native guile, how do you find a good place to eat?</p>
        <p>That question was posed to Chowhound .com's ''general topics'' message board, and as Mr. Leff predicted, the chowhound community responded with a host of common-sense suggestions, including these:</p>
        <p>* ''Try to stop in a town that looks big enough to have a real main street and small enough so we don't waste time or get lost.''</p>
        <p>* ''Art or craft gallery owners seem to have a pretty good pulse on the food scene, as do antique dealers.''</p>
        <p>* ''Plan your trip to take you through college towns. In western Massachusetts, for instance, Amherst, Northampton and Great Barrington offer tons of good restaurants a short drive from major routes.''</p>
        <p>* ''Look for full parking lots at lunchtime. Not foolproof certainly, but it separates the strong from the weak in the market.''</p>
        <p>* ''Find an excuse to go inside and take a peek at what people are eating. It's the only way I know to weed out the promising facades from the real deal.''</p>
        <p>Jane and Michael Stern ask plenty of questions, too, both before they set out and when they arrive. Good people to sound out, Mr. Stern said, are salespeople who might have covered the territory you'll be visiting, or people who were students there. And when you arrive, he said, ''don't ask, 'Is there a good restaurant?'; ask, 'Where do you go out to eat?' ''</p>
        <p>''If you're lucky,'' he went on, ''they'll say, 'It's not much, but we always go for the she-crab soup at the Sweet Shoppe.' ''</p>
