        <p>We usually think of vacation as a stratagem to divert your brain with new sights and tastes (a ''change''). The idea is to shed the worries of your life and restore your energy to face them again. I wonder, though, if that is often the result. The vacation I remember most was the one during which I realized I wanted to kill my husband.</p>
        <p>He was standing with his back to me, gazing into a magnificent and deep canyon in Utah, and it came to me that if I were to hurl myself at him with all my force, precipitating him thousands of feet into the chasm, my troubles would be over. Only then did I begin to suspect that all was not right in my life. Vacations sometimes provide the leisure to realize unpleasant things you haven't had time to notice before, and maybe it's this that makes it so hard for almost everybody to come home to face real life again.</p>

        <p>Some might say that homicidal emotions were only natural in someone in the throes of a three-week camping trip in a VW van with two other adults (husband and housekeeper) and four children under the age of 6.</p>
        <p>That was not how I saw it at the time. Then, it seemed an epiphany in the classic literary sense, an event after which nothing afterward would be the same.</p>
        <p>Of course, I didn't do it, but perhaps only because I was afraid it wouldn't work.</p>
        <p>We had driven from California through a series of beautiful national parks with camping gear -- the whole kit of Coleman stove, camera, sleeping bags, maps, diapers, endless boxes of Kraft macaroni and cheese. The children slept inside the VW, after trying to sleep outside on an air mattress on the ground as we did. So did the housekeeper, who had come along only because she wanted to visit relatives who lived near Denver. Sleeping on the ground didn't seem natural to her or to me, but we had convinced ourselves that we were having a back-to-nature experience, with the attendant high thoughts.</p>
        <p>It was in Yellowstone that the bear came into camp as we were having supper. We had heard what you do -- abandon the food and scamper for cover inside your car or your tent. When we were safely inside the van, I realized that we had left the baby outside, in the dark by the embers of the fire, to the mercy of the wild beast. A moment of panic, of inexpressible maternal chagrin, of terrified resolve. Perhaps a fleeting exchange of glances with the baby's father, before I dashed outside and snatched up the precious bundle.</p>
        <p>What I cannot remember now is whether this was before or after the moment on the cliff. Perhaps it doesn't matter. I think this was my last vacation, and certainly my last camping trip, so memorable in every other detail.</p>
