        <p>SARATOGA shimmered in my mind's eye long before I saw the real thing, and when I finally got there, taking a Trailways bus up from the Port Authority in the summer of 1969, the shock of recognition was acute. It was like seeing a famous painting for the first time after knowing it only from books. That analogy sounds strange, but, in fact, I have felt the full intensity of my first view of Saratoga only one other time, years later, coming upon Seurat's ''Sunday on la Grande Jatte'' on my first visit to the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
        <p>Both the painting and the town -- actually the city of Saratoga Springs -- seemed so exactly right, so perfectly and utterly themselves, bestowing pure pleasure without the disconcerting element of surprise. I have returned to Saratoga many times since, but never without paying a moment's mental homage to that first glimpse of the Victorian houses on Union Avenue, the turreted roof of the racetrack's grandstand, the colonnaded fronts of the bathhouses in the Saratoga State Park, with their beckoning air of mystery and faded decadence.</p>

        <p>SARATOGA shimmered in my mind's eye long before I saw the real thing, and when I finally got there, taking a Trailways bus up from the Port Authority in the summer of 1969, the shock of recognition was acute. It was like seeing a famous painting for the first time after knowing it only from books. That analogy sounds strange, but, in fact, I have felt the full intensity of my first view of Saratoga only one other time, years later, coming upon Seurat's ''Sunday on la Grande Jatte'' on my first visit to the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
        <p>Both the painting and the town -- actually the city of Saratoga Springs -- seemed so exactly right, so perfectly and utterly themselves, bestowing pure pleasure without the disconcerting element of surprise. I have returned to Saratoga many times since, but never without paying a moment's mental homage to that first glimpse of the Victorian houses on Union Avenue, the turreted roof of the racetrack's grandstand, the colonnaded fronts of the bathhouses in the Saratoga State Park, with their beckoning air of mystery and faded decadence.</p>
        <p>It is not, in fact, necessary to like horse racing or even horses to appreciate Saratoga, which offers music, dance, Revolutionary War history and Gilded Age memorabilia among its considerable non-equine attractions. But it is not by chance that my visits over the years have coincided with the thoroughbred racing season. (Saratoga Race Course's season, its 132nd, runs this year from July 26 until Labor Day; Saratoga Raceway, a nearby harness track, with which I also gained familiarity during my four years as a correspondent in The Times's Albany bureau, offers nighttime racing about 10 months a year.)</p>
        <p>Serious sport takes place in Saratoga: it is a prime testing time for 2-year-old colts and fillies making their first starts, as well as a proving ground for the 3-year-old veterans of the Triple Crown races. Major league racing shuts down elsewhere in New York State, and the entire operation moves to Saratoga. But for all the weightiness of the enterprise, the atmosphere is that of a country festival, where various subpopulations share a common interest while pursuing it in very different ways.</p>
        <p>For the most part, these different groups come together only at the spot behind the stands where the horses are saddled for the next race. There, picnickers in their shorts and jeans cross paths with well-dressed owners and the serious horseplayers up from the city, who are there not because it is Saratoga but because it is where the action happens to be. There are many ways to experience Saratoga and, having tried as many as possible, I can attest that each has its charms.</p>
        <p>I have feasted on filet mignon in the clubhouse and on a spicy Caribbean stew dished out by its cook from a pushcart on the lawn behind the grandstand. (Speaking of food, breakfast at the track is a particular treat while watching the morning workouts and enjoying the produce of local farms, like the locally famous Hand melons.) I have stood in line at the downtown Holiday Inn, where reserved seats for the track are sold for the next day's racing, and I have flashed the season's pass that Albany reporters used to receive as a perk from the New York Racing Association. (Note to editors: the statute of limitations on this ethical lapse has expired.) I have held my place on a grandstand bench with a folded copy of The Daily Racing Form, and I once watched the races from the Governor's box.</p>
        <p>It was on that occasion, in the mid-70's, that I met Ogden Phipps, who owned Buckpasser, a retired champion of a decade earlier and my all-time favorite racehorse. There was much that I wanted to ask Mr. Phipps, a towering figure in the sport, but I found myself tongue-tied. ''How is Buckpasser?'' I finally managed to say.</p>
        <p>''He's fine, I saw him just the other day,'' Mr. Phipps replied, as if my question had been the most natural thing in the world. I was as star-struck as if someone had casually mentioned just spending a day on a Hollywood back lot with Paul Newman.</p>
        <p>THE owners and other high-society participants in the racing season, some of whom maintain elaborate second homes in Saratoga, generally keep to a private social calendar. But there is one opportunity to pass among them, at the annual yearling auction, held early in the season by the Fasig-Tipton company, in a special sales pavilion near the track. On display, in hundreds of stalls behind the pavilion, are some of the most regally bred young horses on the planet, their fragile beauty at once breathtaking and, given the weight of the human hopes they will soon be asked to carry, poignant as well.</p>
        <p>Admission to the auction itself is limited to the in-crowd, but I confess that more than once, having dressed for the occasion, I have walked in, made a purposeful beeline for an empty seat and simply sat down. (Note to the Fasig-Tipton people: the statute of limitations on this offense has expired.) The downside to crashing the yearling sales is having to worry about the humiliation of being thrown out if the seat's real owner arrives to claim it. But the sale runs for several nights, and not everyone attends all the time.</p>
        <p>The reward is to witness a colorful and singular event. One at a time, the yearlings (most are 16 or 17 months old, since thoroughbred breeding is timed for early spring births) are led down the runway into the sales ring. A groom follows a few paces behind, with the equipment for the discrete removal of the inevitable product of the young horses' nervousness. The auctioneer, who appears to know most members of the audience by name, gives a brief description of the yet-to-be-named yearling's genealogy, with the accomplishments of the sire and dam, and the bidding begins.</p>
        <p>I HAPPENED to be attending the sale the night in August 1974 when Richard Nixon announced that he was resigning the presidency. The auction was suspended and, in almost complete silence, the crowd rose and walked outside, where a big television screen had been set up. When President Nixon finished speaking, we all went back inside and the bidding resumed. The next day, I brought a transistor radio to the track so that I could listen to President Ford proclaiming that our long national nightmare was over.</p>
        <p>Racing at Saratoga has been growing in popularity, with average daily attendance of about 25,000. On hot days, rainy days or days of major races, it can feel crowded and uncomfortable. As a result, our recent practice on family trips has been to arrive in Saratoga over a weekend and relax by taking in a performance at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center and strolling around town. We spend Monday at the track.</p>
        <p>It is an uncrowded day, when the racing is not necessarily the best -- there are often a few unbettable races for 2-year-old maidens, horses who have never won a race or, in many cases, even started in one. But all the aesthetics of the scene are there. Gambling itself is not really what draws me to Saratoga, in any event; there are many more convenient places to play the horses and, as only a casual racegoer these days, I know better than to harbor any expectation of beating the races. Still, we have had our good days at the betting window. When our daughter, Hannah, was about 8, she picked up the rudiments of how to read the past performances and selected several long-priced winners in a row, urging them home with great enthusiasm. One hard-bitten fellow in the next row came over and asked if he could touch her hair, for good luck.</p>
        <p>After a hiatus of a few years, we will be returning this summer to stay at Union Gables, a friendly 10-room bed and breakfast just down Union Avenue from the track. Built in 1901, the Queen Anne-style house is a former Skidmore College dormitory, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. I like to carry my breakfast out to the front porch, take a seat and indulge in the momentary fantasy that this is my home and that I belong there -- which, in a way, after all these years, I suppose I do.</p>
