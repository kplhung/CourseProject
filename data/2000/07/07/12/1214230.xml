        <p>MEMO from Northern California to those seeking longevity: Forget hemp nuts. Try bug juice and lanyards. Before moving from Brooklyn, N.Y., to Piedmont, Calif., less than a year ago, it would not have occurred to me that I would soon be taking family travel advice from a clinical sexologist I met at a workout studio in Berkeley. I surely never imagined that the following summer, along with my family, I would be sitting in a dining hall packed with fellow professionals and their families singing: Bruce! Bruce! Strong and able. Get your elbows off the table!</p>
        <p>One of the hardest, and perhaps most unheralded, aspects of moving is leaving summertime rituals behind. I'm thinking of beloved places like the crystalline swimming hole beside the pasture in the Berkshires, or the trail fragrant with wild raspberry bushes in the Adirondacks.

        <p>MEMO from Northern California to those seeking longevity: Forget hemp nuts. Try bug juice and lanyards. Before moving from Brooklyn, N.Y., to Piedmont, Calif., less than a year ago, it would not have occurred to me that I would soon be taking family travel advice from a clinical sexologist I met at a workout studio in Berkeley. I surely never imagined that the following summer, along with my family, I would be sitting in a dining hall packed with fellow professionals and their families singing: Bruce! Bruce! Strong and able. Get your elbows off the table!</p>
        <p>One of the hardest, and perhaps most unheralded, aspects of moving is leaving summertime rituals behind. I'm thinking of beloved places like the crystalline swimming hole beside the pasture in the Berkshires, or the trail fragrant with wild raspberry bushes in the Adirondacks. So my spirits lifted when my friend told me about Berkeley Tuolumne Camp (pronounced too-WAH-la-me), a camp for families managed by the city of Berkeley, nestled beside the south fork of the Tuolumne River, just up the road from Yosemite National Park.</p>
        <p>A sign saying ''Emerald City: 23 Miles'' is the first indication you have arrived at the Berkeley camp (as opposed to the San Jose camp, the Sacramento camp, the Oakland camp or the other family camps run by Northern California municipalities in a tradition dating to the 1920's).</p>
        <p>One of my favorite childhood memories was the week at summer's end, when my family would go to post-camp at Camp Nebagamon in the north woods of Wisconsin, where my father had been a camper. It was a time when our family could be together in a cabin, the nights crisp with nascent autumn, and my father and his friends could act silly and boast about whose canoe left the most aluminum on rocks of the Brule River. Set in the Stanislaus National Forest, with Robinson Crusoe-esque bridges criss-crossing the river, Berkeley Tuolumne -- or B.T.C. as it is known -- is a whole summer of post-camp. It is a place to which families, about a quarter of them Berkeley residents and most with a Berkeley connection, return year after year; many are former campers.</p>
        <p>Each day, the bulletin board lists activities for grown-ups and children, separately and together, including pottery, yoga, juggling and unicycle workshops, raku and watercolor (with a different artist-in-residence each week), volleyball games, evening Coketails for children and cocktails for adults and visits to the sweat lodge. My favorite was lanyard-making with Shairie and Jason, although it became clear that making lanyards at age 45 requires bifocals.</p>
        <p>IT is a close-knit community -- some may say too close -- where children roam freely and when someone yells, Dad!, 10 heads turn. Like all camps, Tuolumne has its traditions. We discovered the first one when the ''mait dogs,'' as the energetic high school and college students who make up the maintenance staff are known, pulled up to our car in green carts resembling rickshaws (actually former World War II ammunition carts) and magically proceeded to unload our vehicle. They thundered down the pine-needle path to our cabin, a canvas tent with a wood floor and no door, equipped with thin mattresses and steel-bed-frames. (Judging from their comfort, probably World War II vintage as well.)</p>
        <p>As one might expect of Berkeley-in-the-wild, sloppy Joes are not on the menu, while there are 17 varieties of tea. But the forest is not immune to Berkeley politics: a few years ago, irate campers rose up in defiance when a city councilwoman proposed replacing BBQ and other summer staples with texturized vegetable protein.</p>
        <p>We arrived, appropriately, in time for lunch, before the venerated quiet hour (actually 75 minutes of fanatically enforced downtime, aided by the hypnotic sound of the waterfall). The day was a scorcher, but my son Jacob, 9, ordered hot chocolate and promptly spilled it all over the table. A Julia Roberts look-alike appeared instantly, wielding a sponge. ''Don't worry about it,'' she said angelically. ''You're on vacation!''</p>
        <p>It is this youthful enthusiasm that makes campers like Jim Bird, an anesthesiologist from Menlo Park who grew up going to Tuolumne and had returned with his parents and his family, perpetuate the traditions. Dr. Bird could be found one morning hovering over a slab of clay in the pottery studio. He was fashioning it into a pre-Columbian-style figurine, muttering, ''I'm going to fire this thing, bury it and then sell it on eBay.''</p>
        <p>Dave Mocosko, a 31-year-old information technology consultant from Silicon Valley, was sitting in one of the green Adirondack chairs in front of the dining hall, the camp's town square, absorbed in a lanyard. ''This is exciting,'' he said. ''I've frittered away an entire morning.''</p>
        <p>And so it went over the course of two lazy days. (The average stay is five and a half days.) The mornings and afternoons came and went, and then came and went some more, punctuated by the sound of blue jays and Ping-Pong. Mark Twain couldn't envisage a more perfect fishing spot than the one here, a small, gentle island with tree stumps surrounded by translucent trout-filled pools.</p>
        <p>''This is our sacred week,'' said JoAnne Copperud, an environmental engineer from Oakland. ''My children like Camp Tuolumne better than Christmas.''</p>
        <p>Over the years, her children (a 12-year-old girl and 10-year-old boy) have felt safe enough to test their independence, beginning with walking to the cabin by themselves when they were very young. ''This is where they take leaps forward,'' Ms. Copperud observed, sitting by the river at twilight.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1922, the camp is part of the organized family camping movement that flourished in Northern California in the 20's, when municipalities and universities, responding to Bay Area fog and urbanization, began purchasing land and existing buildings for their citizens. (The University of California at Berkeley and Stanford University also have family camps.) The early Berkeley campers reached the Tuolumne River in touring cars, attending camp in silk stockings and white shoes.</p>
        <p>THE camps, about 15 in all, survived intact with modern improvements (if communal bathrooms to which one staggers in the middle of the night clutching a flashlight can be called such). Befitting a city of purists, the Berkeley camp is kept rustic, shunning swimming pools, cars on the premises and electricity in the cabins. The kitchen adheres to current boycotts.</p>
        <p>California is once again at the forefront: Peg Smith, the executive director of the American Camping Association, said that family camps, most of them special programs for families set up at regular camps, have grown about 500 percent over the past 12 years. ''It's one of the most remarkable increases we've seen in any camping trend,'' she said, attributing it to a longing for family time and a sense of community.</p>
        <p>Jerry Horn, the director of the Berkeley camp, noted that one appeal is that ''families also get a vacation from each other.'' Children can play basketball, for instance, while adults can learn to use stilts.</p>
        <p>''One thing American culture doesn't foster is parents playing,'' said Scott Gelfand, a veteran counselor who produces the staff musical and runs the Buddy Club, a Bay-area children's entertainment company. ''This is a place where children get to see parents being silly.''</p>
        <p>The camps remain a well-kept secret, although for the cognoscenti, the Berkeley camp's waiting list is now ''worse than private school,'' in Ms. Copperud's words. (Berkeley residents get first dibs.) The best known is probably Camp Mather, the City of San Francisco camp, established on the site of a former timber mill and railroad station built for the construction of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in 1913.</p>
        <p>At the Berkeley camp, a five-day stay for a family of four averages about $700 for Berkeley residents and about $1,000 for nonresidents. (The camp's finances are independent of the city, and it basically supports itself.) There is no minimum stay, and per- diem rates amount to about $250, three meals a day included. For more information, you can write to Camps Office, Health and Human Services, 2016 Center Street, Berkeley, Calif., 94704; call (510) 644-6520; or consult the camp's Web site, at www .berkeleycamps.com.</p>
        <p>The Tuolumne River is in its glory here, forming what may be the quintessential swimming hole, with smooth granite boulders for diving. The water, which is bracingly cold, glitters with gold mica flecks, conjuring up images of the forty-niners. Our sons, Jacob and his brother, Gabe, 6, spent blissful hours doing what children are supposed to do in the summer -- their raft was the Titanic; the boulders, icebergs.</p>
        <p>We learned from them. ''You know the great thing about clay?'' Gabe observed at the pottery wheel. ''If you mess it up, you can start all over.''</p>
        <p>On our last morning, the entire dining room sang the goodbye song. I'll spare you the details, but what is it about camp that causes sane people to burst into song? Judy Vared, who is now in her 50's and began coming here at age 2, vividly recalled the fire fall on the Fourth of July, since discontinued, in which staffers lighted pine cones and let them fall flickering into the river. ''There aren't too many traditions I can pass on to my kids, and camp is one,'' she said. ''Probably the simplest, best one.''</p>
        <p>We missed Table Night, in which each table performs a skit after dinner (the Lord was merciful). But on the way home, pulling away from the Ponderosa pines after the juggling lessons, I realized that I was beginning to feel rooted. A ritual was starting. So was a lanyard.</p>
