        <p>''A splendid entertainment for the entire family -- no sex, no violence'' was how Alfred Leslie archly plugged his new film ''Pull My Daisy'' in Variety in 1959.</p>
        <p>''And then I quoted a line of Jack's: 'Doing something and saying goodbye and saying goodbye and doing something are both the same,' '' he said.

        <p>''A splendid entertainment for the entire family -- no sex, no violence'' was how Alfred Leslie archly plugged his new film ''Pull My Daisy'' in Variety in 1959.</p>
        <p>''And then I quoted a line of Jack's: 'Doing something and saying goodbye and saying goodbye and doing something are both the same,' '' he said. ''Which means, I think, living a life is enough to be able to get through life, and you don't always have to be enormously active or a great star.''</p>
        <p>The Jack in question is, of course, Jack Kerouac. That many of the Beats went on to achieve a potent stardom is almost beside the point. From its inception, Beat lent itself to myriad interpretations, but to people like Kerouac, it derived mostly from ''beatific.''</p>
        <p>On Friday at 10 p.m., Channel 13/WNET will present ''Pull My Daisy,'' a slice --  more a sliver -- of a day in the lives of the Beats. In its television debut, the film leads a program of five shorts that reflect the Beat philosophy, part of the channel's independent film series ''Reel New York.''</p>
        <p>A sort of wry social commentary, the film is at once about nothing and everything. There is no plot, no story, no action or drama. Photographed in grainy black and white, a band of urban troubadours enter a loft on the Lower East Side and wreak merry havoc on the lives within. Slouching on a sofa, flasks in hand, the men spout poetry and ponder spirituality, their voices sounding oddly the same, their mouths not quite in sync with the vocal track, which scats along to a loose, bluesy beat. Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso and Larry Rivers are doing what they did best: hanging out, kicking back, taking it all in. As the narrator, a coolly ebullient Kerouac makes his words their own.</p>
        <p>Directed by Mr. Leslie and the photographer Robert Frank, the film was based on an act from Kerouac's unproduced play  ''The Beat Generation'' and named for a poem by Ginsberg and Kerouac. The play, in turn, was inspired by an incident in the lives of Neal Cassady, Kerouac's partner on the road, and Cassady's wife, Carolyn, who aspired to suburban respectability in Northern California.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leslie, now 74, envisioned the project as part of a trilogy, but almost immediately ran into a stumbling block in Kerouac's syntax. ''When I read his text and thought of the actors speaking the lines, I thought it was insane,'' he said. ''It didn't sound right. I decided against shooting.''</p>
        <p>Only after hearing Kerouac read the script himself did a concept take shape. ''What troubled me,'' Mr. Leslie said, ''was that there were no characters in Jack's work. All of Jack Kerouac is written as a monologuist taking everybody's part.'' So it was decided: Kerouac would do all the speaking for everyone.</p>
        <p>Watching the film in a sound studio, Kerouac dubbed its narration as David Amram, the composer and musician who would later write the score for ''The Manchurian Candidate,'' sat in a booth and played the piano.</p>
        <p>Not quite 30 minutes long, ''Pull My Daisy'' opened at the Cinema 16 Film Society in Manhattan as an ''outrageous success, though it made no money and was marginalized immediately,'' Mr. Leslie said. After winning first prize at the San Francisco Film Festival, it quickly lost momentum.</p>
        <p>He stored the film in his West 22nd Street studio, but lost it to a 1966 inferno that killed 12 firefighters. But some scraps were found in the rubble, and he kept them in a refrigerator until a grant in 1990 enabled him to restore the work. A release print had been discovered in the meantime and was presented to the Museum of Modern Art. In 1997, the Library of Congress installed  ''Pull My Daisy'' into its film archive for safekeeping.</p>
        <p>'' 'Pull My Daisy' in 1959 looked like an insane work to people,'' Mr. Leslie said. ''It looked chaotic and unstructured, and people didn't know how to deal with it. But the film had a very, very wide influence because it opened up a way for people to think of being more independent in their vision.''</p>
        <p>''It was a formal film, quiet in tone and movement,'' he continued. ''It had a strong subtext of subversiveness, a Samuel Beckett, Chehkovian kind of quality in which nothing happens. Like a Seinfeld incident of nothing. But I thought in that you could see the naturalness of all of the lives of people.''</p>
        <p>Over time, the trappings of the Beats wore thin, especially to those at the movement's vortex.</p>
        <p>'' 'Pull My Daisy' came about largely from a group of painters and writers who wanted to make a movie to show their children and grandchildren what we were really like,'' said Mr. Amram, 69, who also appeared in the film. ''The image of a beatnik had become so horrific that it was something we couldn't identify with anymore.</p>
        <p>''In 'Pull My Daisy,' nobody looks like a beatnik,'' he said of the cliched turtlenecks, berets and goatees that Kerouac likened to a Roman Catholic school dress code, and the movement's subtext of drugs and malaise. ''We all shared a joy of life, the ability to work hard at what we were trying to do artistically, at having fun.</p>
        <p>''The film is so lighthearted and joyous and funny, it's the antidote to the Beat label,'' he added. ''That was the albatross around all our necks.''</p>
