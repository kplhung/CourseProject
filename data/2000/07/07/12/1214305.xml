        <p>Chad Pennington was branded as the Jets' quarterback of the future when he was selected in the first round of the draft. But today, the Jets announced that they had signed Ray Lucas, the backup quarterback who salvaged last season after Vinny Testaverde was injured in the first game. Lucas agreed to terms for one year at $385,000 with several financial incentives. ''When you search for the heart of the team, there's a lot of heart in Ray Lucas,'' said Coach Al Groh.</p>
        <p>The Jets also made official a one-year deal with receiver Yatil Green, who missed his first two seasons of pro football after suffering knee injuries and last year caught 18 passes for 234 yards for Miami.</p>

        <p>That leaves Pennington as the only player still unsigned. Groh said he was hopeful that the deal would be done by the time players reported Thursday for physicals and a conditioning run. Groh added that he did not think the Jets would have to cut anyone to stay under the salary cap. Two-a-day practices begin Friday.</p>
