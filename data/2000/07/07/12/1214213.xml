        <p>A CENTURY ago, a vacation was the privilege of a minority of Americans. Today, it is held as a sacred right, even if many people do not seem to have time to take it. Below, a sampling of facts and figures on the true national pastime.</p>
        <p>ALL WORK AND NO PLAY -- American workers get far less vacation time than those in other industrialized countries.

        <p>A CENTURY ago, a vacation was the privilege of a minority of Americans. Today, it is held as a sacred right, even if many people do not seem to have time to take it. Below, a sampling of facts and figures on the true national pastime.</p>
        <p>ALL WORK AND NO PLAY -- American workers get far less vacation time than those in other industrialized countries. Here are the figures in days, according to the World Tourism Organization: Italy, 42; France, 37; Germany 35; Brazil, 34; Britain, 28; Canada, 26; South Korea, 25; United States, 13.</p>
        <p>THE NEW ECONOMY? -- When they do travel for pleasure, Americans have a hard time cutting the electronic umbilical cords that bind them to their working lives. Over the past year, 46 percent of vacationers took a cell phone, according to a survey by the Travel Industry Association of America; 18 percent took a beeper and 6 percent a laptop.</p>
        <p>BOOKING ON THE NET -- The travel association said that 39 percent of people planning a family vacation used the Internet in 1999, up from 26 percent the year before. Thirty-four percent used a travel agent, down from 37 percent the year before.</p>
        <p>FAMILY VALUES -- Americans with children opt for traditional destinations; others would rather gamble. Of those taking trips with children in 1999, according to the travel association, 26 percent went to theme parks, 25 percent to historical sites, 23 percent to the beach, 22 percent to a family reunion and just 5 percent to a casino. For couples traveling without children, casinos led the list, at 27 percent, followed by a trip to a city (21 percent), a historical site (20 percent) and the beach (19 percent).</p>
