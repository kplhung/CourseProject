        <p>Adapted from an early unproduced play by Rainier Werner Fassbinder, Francois Ozon's ''Water Drops on Burning Rocks'' never leaves the confines of a Berlin bachelor pad done up in exquisitely detailed mid-70's decor. After a credit sequence of generic French accordion music played over color postcards of the city, the camera settles in the empty apartment to await the entrance of Leopold (Bernard Giraudeau), the suave 50-year-old who lives there, and Franz (Malik Zidi), a 19-year-old redhead he has apparently just picked up.</p>
        <p>What will transpire between Leo and Franz seems self-evident before they exchange a word. The older man, decked out in a snazzy tweed blazer and a red silk ascot, has fairly unambiguous designs on his companion, who wears a black leather jacket, tight jeans and an air of rather studied innocence. But the art of seduction, like the related arts of dramaturgy and filmmaking, is often a matter of taking a circuitous route to a foregone conclusion. And so Leo reminisces about a woman he once loved, Franz natters on about his fiancee, and the two of them play a desultory game of ludo, a board game involving dice and little toy horses.</p>

        <p>Adapted from an early unproduced play by Rainier Werner Fassbinder, Francois Ozon's ''Water Drops on Burning Rocks'' never leaves the confines of a Berlin bachelor pad done up in exquisitely detailed mid-70's decor. After a credit sequence of generic French accordion music played over color postcards of the city, the camera settles in the empty apartment to await the entrance of Leopold (Bernard Giraudeau), the suave 50-year-old who lives there, and Franz (Malik Zidi), a 19-year-old redhead he has apparently just picked up.</p>
        <p>What will transpire between Leo and Franz seems self-evident before they exchange a word. The older man, decked out in a snazzy tweed blazer and a red silk ascot, has fairly unambiguous designs on his companion, who wears a black leather jacket, tight jeans and an air of rather studied innocence. But the art of seduction, like the related arts of dramaturgy and filmmaking, is often a matter of taking a circuitous route to a foregone conclusion. And so Leo reminisces about a woman he once loved, Franz natters on about his fiancee, and the two of them play a desultory game of ludo, a board game involving dice and little toy horses.</p>
        <p>Their conversation then takes a surprising -- that is to say an entirely predictable -- turn (''Have you ever slept with a man?'' ''Why do you ask that all of a sudden?''), and its consummation is followed by the equivalent of a dropped curtain, as a title card announces the beginning of Act II.</p>
        <p>''Act'' is something of a double-entendre, since each of the first three sections of the film concludes with a different character stretched out naked on the bed in anticipation of the attentions of another. Mr. Ozon, who has confessed to taking a few liberties with Fassbinder's script, presents a beguiling and disconcerting blend of anxiety and comedy, and achieves an improbable marriage of Gallic levity and Teutonic gravity.</p>
        <p>By the second act, which takes place six months after the first, Franz and Leo have settled into the tedium and petty power struggles of a long-term relationship. The apartment, which had seemed a den of erotic mystery, has become a prison of middle-class luxury. Leo's predatory charm has given way to bullying truculence and Franz's naivete has turned into ditziness. Their sexual attraction persists, offering at once surcease from their domestic warfare and a chance to carry it out by other means.</p>
        <p>''Water Drops on Burning Rocks,'' which opens today at the Film Forum, is a brilliant satire of emotional politics. In retrospect, the script, written when Fassbinder was 19, anticipates his mature films, with their romantic pessimism, their air of jaded sophistication and their unexpected reserves of compassion. It also shows his appetite for complication. After two acts of Leo and Franz, ''Water Drops on Burning Rocks'' invites Anna (Ludivine Sagnier), Franz's loyal, fresh-faced fiancee, and Vera (Anna Thomson), Leo's possibly transsexual old flame, into the previously all-male love nest, and the movie seamlessly slides from soigne sex farce into orgy, musical, tragedy and morality play. The ending is a mess, but a mess perpetrated by a young genius. And cleaned up, as much as anyone would want or hope, by another. Mr. Ozon's movie is sure to enthrall Fassbinder fans, for whom the great bad boy's death in 1982, at the unthinkable age of 36, remains an immitigable loss. But this is very much Mr. Ozon's movie, rather than just a bit of recovered juvenilia or a hastily filmed theatrical performance. The director uses the formal constraints of a single set and a limited cast as an opportunity for dexterous and kinetic camera work, which seems perpetually to discover fresh angles and new perspectives on the same decor. The decor, by the way, is amazingly evocative down to the smallest detail: shag carpets, oversize books bound in white leather, a fat rotary-dial telephone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ozon enlivens this studied realism with moments of inspired theatricality, as when the four characters burst into a hip-shaking line dance to the strains of a German disco record. And for all the specificity of its setting, ''Water Drops on Burning Rocks'' seems to unfold, like a late Bunuel movie, in a surreal trans-European dreamland. Are Leo and Franz German or French? Where on earth is Vera from? It hardly matters, since for the duration of this mordant, mischievous film you have no real desire to leave their fastidiously decorated purgatory. And neither, for all their protestations to the contrary, do they.</p>
