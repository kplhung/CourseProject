        <p>You are eagerly anticipating a trip to one of the world's great cities, but dreading the thought of looking like a tourist. What to do? Just leave those bright plaid Bermuda shorts at home, and follow these tips from Times correspondents.</p>
        <p>IT is easy to spot the tourists in London. Those who are young and don't mind urban grime tend to congregate in the center of Trafalgar Square, where they sit among the pigeons and discuss whether or not to jump into the fountains. Those in family groups flock to Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, Madame Tussaud's and the Tower of London. These places, delightful as they might be once their perimeters have been penetrated, should be rigorously avoided by the discerning visitor.</p>

        <p>You are eagerly anticipating a trip to one of the world's great cities, but dreading the thought of looking like a tourist. What to do? Just leave those bright plaid Bermuda shorts at home, and follow these tips from Times correspondents.</p>
        <p>IT is easy to spot the tourists in London. Those who are young and don't mind urban grime tend to congregate in the center of Trafalgar Square, where they sit among the pigeons and discuss whether or not to jump into the fountains. Those in family groups flock to Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, Madame Tussaud's and the Tower of London. These places, delightful as they might be once their perimeters have been penetrated, should be rigorously avoided by the discerning visitor.</p>
        <p>Instead, buy Time Out, a weekly magazine that tells you what's on and what's new. (Time Out New York is an offshoot of the London version.) If Time Out has a slightly leftish slant, it is also thorough and discerning and should be consulted if you plan to go to the theater and want to avoid tourist traps like, well, ''The Mousetrap,'' the desiccated Agatha Christie play in the West End.</p>
        <p>This summer, do not leave London without paying a visit to the Tate Modern, a soaring space on the less-traveled south side of the Thames River. It will be full of tourists, but only smart ones like yourself, and the crowds will be well leavened by art-appreciating natives.</p>
        <p>After that, take the tube to Hampstead Heath and go for a long, meandering walk. With its delightful mix of the cultivated and the wild, the Heath is the perfect place to contemplate the past and anticipate the future.</p>
        <p>Afterward, browse among the boutiques on Heath Street and Hampstead High Street, before stopping at Ben's Cookies, which has the biggest, chewiest, gooiest cookies in all of London.</p>
        <p>A word about how to dress: London can turn cold and rainy at any moment, even in the summer. American tourists here often mistakenly think they can get by in the lightest of shorts and T-shirts. They're the ones shivering and complaining at the crosswalks. Smart locals, however, know they should always carry an outer covering, even if it's just a cheap raincoat.</p>
