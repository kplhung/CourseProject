        <p>The American painter Ellsworth Kelly, the French sculptor Niki de Saint Phalle, the British architect Richard Rogers, the German composer Hans Werner Henze and the American composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim are the recipients of the 12th Praemium Imperiale Awards, presented by the Japan Art Association for outstanding achievement in the arts. The recipients were announced yesterday at a ceremony at the Tate Modern in London.</p>
        <p>The five awards, among the largest in the arts with a stipend of about $140,000 each, are given in areas not covered by the Nobel Prizes: painting, sculpture, architecture, music and theater-film. The prizes will be presented, along with commemorative medals from the Japanese imperial family, in Tokyo on Oct. 26.</p>
        <p>Recipients of the awards are selected each year by the art association on the recommendations of a board of international advisers representing Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Past recipients have included the actor John Gielgud, the painter David Hockney, the architect Frank O. Gehry and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.</p>
        <p>The association also presents a grant of about $47,000 to an organization that supports the development of young artists. This year's winner is the Ulster Youth Orchestra, which said it planned to use the award to perform and study in England for the first time.</p>
        <p>The announcement ceremonies are rotated among the advisers' home cities. This year's host was Sir Edward Heath, the former British Prime Minister, who has been an adviser since the awards began in 1989.</p>
