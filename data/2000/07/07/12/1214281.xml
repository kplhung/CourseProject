        <p>As the widely publicized hopes of a cure for AIDS have vanished and the limitations of standard drug therapy have become increasingly apparent, scientists are urgently seeking new strategies to make better use of therapies they have, researchers said today.</p>
        <p>Their discussion took place here at the 13th international AIDS conference.</p>
        <p>One strategy came from a top United States government scientist who announced promising early findings from two new trials aimed at giving long breaks in treatment to people infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
        <p>The aim is to help the body cope with the virus on its own for varying periods and make it easier for infected people to take the drugs. But the interrupted therapy would not be a cure.</p>
        <p>Need for such new solutions was underscored by studies reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention questioning how long the drug combinations being used will remain effective against the virus.</p>
        <p>Combinations of anti-H.I.V. drugs successfully suppressed the virus for 12 months or more in only one-third of infected Americans, so patients are having to change drugs and regimens increasingly often to maintain their benefits, said Dr. Scott Holmberg, an epidemiologist at the C.D.C.</p>
        <p>No one here is questioning that many infected people have benefited greatly from the combinations of newer and older anti-H.I.V. drugs.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Mauro Schechter of Brazil said scientists might have overestimated the contributions of the group of drugs known as protease inhibitors in lowering the death rates from AIDS.</p>
        <p>Other drugs, which prevent the many secondary infections that result when H.I.V. damages the immune system, have received less credit than they deserve in lowering death rates, Dr. Schechter, of the University of Rio de Janiero, said in urging a renewed interest in such drugs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schechter also said that giving patients a break from taking their pills for extended, planned periods could make drug regimens safer and more affordable if studies showed the technique to be successful.</p>
        <p>Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., said many studies had made it ''clear that eradication of H.I.V. is not possible with the drugs currently available,'' and that prolonged or lifetime courses of drug combinations were not feasible for most infected people.</p>
        <p>The sobering realization contrasts with the optimism, if not euphoria, that enveloped the AIDS meeting in Vancouver in 1996, when leading experts talked about the prospects of curing AIDS.</p>
        <p>Dr. Fauci reported that he and scientists at 10 or so medical centers in the United States and Europe were conducting trials on the effectiveness of various ways to give interrupted therapy. For example, participants in some studies stop taking drugs for varying periods of time until H.I.V. rebounds to a predetermined level in their blood.</p>
        <p>Dr. Fauci's team has begun two small trials to determine whether patients can stop and restart therapy for specified periods in well-defined cycles. Both trials include people who took drugs that suppressed H.I.V. to levels undetectable by blood tests.</p>
        <p>One trial involves 70 participants. Half are taking their drugs continuously. The others are taking the drugs for two months and then stopping them for one month. In nine participants, the virus rose when they stopped taking the drugs -- although to lower levels each time -- but returned to undetectable levels after they resumed the same therapy.</p>
        <p>In the second study, participants are alternating drug therapy for a week and then stopping for a week in repetitive cycles. The week's break does not give the virus enough time to rebound except in a rare case, Dr. Fauci said.</p>
        <p>He expressed hope that over time, cycles might be extended so patients could forgo drug therapy for six to eight months. In an interview, he said that ''we are not trying to immunize them to the point where we could completely stop therapy.''</p>
        <p>Because less medication would be taken, the intermittent therapy presumably would reduce unwanted side-effects.</p>
        <p>To Dr. Fauci, the greatest potential benefit of intermittent therapy would be in providing Africans an easier and more affordable way to take the drugs that are widely used in rich countries.</p>
        <p>A drawback is that the tests to measure H.I.V. levels in the blood are now needed before individuals start the intermittent therapy, and the tests are not widely available in Africa. But Dr. Fauci expressed hope that if the studies document the therapy's benefits, simpler ways will be found to carry it out in Africa, where AIDS has hit with devastating force.</p>
        <p>Because it is planned, the interrupted therapy being tested in the studies differs from the drug holidays that many infected people take on their own, running the risk of creating viral resistance to drugs.</p>
