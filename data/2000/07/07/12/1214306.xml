        <p>The last time Caryn Wilson played in a tournament in the metropolitan area was at the United States Open tennis championships in Flushing Meadows, Queens.</p>
        <p>In those days, in the late 1970's and early 80's, Wilson, who was then Caryn Copeland, also played singles and doubles at Wimbledon and in the Australian Open. Wilson was a star captain of the Stanford women's tennis team that added a National Collegiate Athletic Association team championship in 1982 to the N.C.A.A. women's doubles title she won with with Alycia Moulton in 1981.</p>

        <p>The last time Caryn Wilson played in a tournament in the metropolitan area was at the United States Open tennis championships in Flushing Meadows, Queens.</p>
        <p>In those days, in the late 1970's and early 80's, Wilson, who was then Caryn Copeland, also played singles and doubles at Wimbledon and in the Australian Open. Wilson was a star captain of the Stanford women's tennis team that added a National Collegiate Athletic Association team championship in 1982 to the N.C.A.A. women's doubles title she won with with Alycia Moulton in 1981.</p>
        <p>These days, though, Wilson is hitting golf balls, not tennis balls, in preparation for Thursday's opening round of the Japan Airlines Big Apple golf tournament at the Wykagyl Country Club. Her days as a world-class tennis player long gone -- she left the Women's Tennis Association tour in 1986 after three years on the circuit -- Wilson is a 39-year-old rookie on the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour.</p>
        <p>So, too, is another golfing late bloomer with other athletic credentials, Debbie Williams, 40. Like Wilson, Williams did not take up golf until she was 31. Her late start followed a career as one of the nation's best javelin throwers, good enough to have set a Big Ten record and to have competed in seven United States Olympic Festivals, six as a javelin thrower and one as a softball player.</p>
        <p>Given the elite field here that includes the four-time winners Annika Sorenstam and Karrie Webb, as well as 9 of the 10 leading money earners on the L.P.G.A. tour, it is questionable that either Wilson or Williams will make the 36-hole cut on Friday. Both newcomers have struggled during their rookie seasons, with Wilson missing the cut in all eight tournaments she has played and Williams making the cut in one of five events.</p>
        <p>But no one can deny Wilson the distinction she achieved last year when she qualified for the United States Open golf tournament. Wilson's feat has been matched by only one other athlete, Althea Gibson.</p>
        <p>''The big difference is that Althea won the tennis open while I never came close,'' Wilson said.</p>
        <p>The presence of Wilson and Williams in the field of 144 at this year's tournament is an accomplishment in itself considering their late starts in a sport in which most of their competitors have been playing since they were preteens. The 29-year-old Sorenstam, for example, began playing when she was 12, while Webb, who is 25, started at 8.</p>
        <p>At least Williams, who still holds the women's javelin record at Michigan, has made some money, albeit not much -- $1,505 and No. 1,283 on the tour while making the cut in both tournaments she has played this year on the Futures Tour. Wilson, by contrast, has collected only $771 after making two of six cuts in Futures Tour tournaments.</p>
        <p>''It's a good thing my husband has made some good investments,'' Wilson said before a practice round today at Wykagyl. ''In golf, unlike team sports, you can wind up playing for nothing, as I have this year.''</p>
        <p>With a smooth, fluid swing, the 5-foot-5-inch Wilson looks every bit the professional golfer she has been for the last two years, although she did not qualify for the L.P.G.A. tour until last fall. Her husband, Stan, a former television reporter and anchorman, serves as her caddy and drives their mobile home to tournaments.</p>
        <p>Her progress as a golfer has been relatively swift. After six years as a tennis coach at Stanford, at Santa Monica Junior College and with the national women's team, Wilson and her husband moved to Rancho Mirage, Calif., in 1992.</p>
        <p>''We joined Mission Hills,'' Wilson said of the course near Palm Springs, ''and before long I began hitting some golf balls. By the end of the year I was down to a 9 or 10 handicap, and the next year I won the club tournament.''</p>
        <p>Five years later, Wilson reached the semifinals of the North/South Amateur Championships and won a tournament on the Players West satellite tour as an amateur.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt my tennis helped me as a competitor,'' said Wilson, who combined with her mother, Ginny, to win the 1994 national mother-daughter tennis doubles championship, the last competitive tennis event she entered. ''It's helped my focus and my work ethic. Also, at my age, I'm not going to get intimidated.''</p>
        <p>Having competed against some of the world's best women's tennis players may have also helped.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to talk about some big wins in tennis, but there weren't many on the tour,'' Wilson said. ''But I did help launch quite a few careers. I lost to Gabriella Sabatini in Japan, when she was 14 and virtually unknown, and she went on to win the tournament. I also remember blowing a 4-1 lead in the third set to Tracy Austin when she was starting out. And I lost a match to Pam Shriver not long before she won the U.S. Open at the age of 16.''</p>
