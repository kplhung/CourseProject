      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Monday about Tiffany F. Goldberg, who was attacked on Sunday with a piece of concrete on a Manhattan street, misstated the affiliation of the Marble Collegiate Church, where she sings in the choir. It is part of the Reformed Church in America, not the Presbyterian Church. The error was repeated yesterday.</p>
        <p>A caption yesterday misstated the origin and date of a picture of Ms. Goldberg in some copies. It was by Ralph McCall in 1994, not from her 1992 high school yearbook.</p>
