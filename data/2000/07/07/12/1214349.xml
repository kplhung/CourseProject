        <p>The Senate took a first step today toward a vote on a Republican proposal to repeal the federal estate tax, and Democrats scrambled to avoid defections that could allow passage of the bill later this week.</p>
        <p>The legislation, which passed the House last month with support from some Democrats, would gradually eliminate the federal tax on large estates. Republicans said the tax robs many people at death of much of any wealth they have accumulated for their heirs, and hits family-owned farms and small businesses particularly hard.</p>
        <p>''The idea that the federal government would reach into the grave and pull back half of a life's work offends people regardless of race, sex, region, financial situation or anything else,'' said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader.</p>
        <p>The Senate began debating the estate tax bill today as Congress also prepared to take up other tax legislation. The Senate also plans to begin debate this week on a Republican plan to cut taxes for married couples.</p>
        <p>In the House today, a bipartisan group unveiled a bill, which could come to the floor for a vote as soon as next week, that would allow increased tax-free contributions to individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has signaled that he would veto the estate tax bill. But mindful that 9 of 45 Democratic senators have endorsed repeal of the estate tax, Democratic leaders unveiled an alternative proposal today that would eliminate the tax for most family-owned businesses and farms but leave it in place for a relatively small number of multimillion-dollar estates.</p>
        <p>But it was unclear whether Democrats would be able to block the Republican bill as it confronts a procedural hurdle. To cut off debate on the bill and bring it to a final vote, the legislation's sponsors would have to muster 60 votes, meaning that Republicans would have to be joined by at least five Democrats.</p>
        <p>The nine Democrats who support estate tax repeal urged Mr. Lott tonight to allow consideration of the Democratic alternative as well as other Democratic amendments.</p>
        <p>So far Mr. Lott and his Democratic counterpart, Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota, have been unable to agree on what measures should be considered, and if there is no agreement that Mr. Lott could force a vote on cutting off debate later this week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle said he is confident that all 45 Democrats will stick together to block a final vote on the bill if Republicans do not allow them to vote on the amendments they want to offer. But Mr. Lott said that if he can find a way to have a final vote, the bill would win support from as many as 70 senators.</p>
        <p>The Republican bill would decrease federal revenues by $104 billion over the first 10 years, and $750 billion in its second decade. Democrats said their alternative would reduce revenues by $64 billion over the first 10 years and $300 billion over the second decade.</p>
        <p>Democrats said that by insisting on full repeal of the tax, Republicans were intent on handing over a huge chunk of projected federal budget surpluses to the rich while doing nothing to address issues of concern to working people.</p>
        <p>Under current law, estates valued at up to $675,000 are exempt from federal taxation, and the exemption is scheduled to rise to $1 million in 2006. Family-owned businesses and farms are exempt up to $1.3 million. Above those levels, estates are subject to a graduated tax with a top rate of 55 percent.</p>
        <p>The issue has become politically potent as the 76 million members of the baby boom generation, their wealth swollen by the strong economy and stock market, has begun estate planning.</p>
