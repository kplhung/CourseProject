        <p>Editorial support efforts to preserve Anderson Cottage, where Pres Abraham Lincoln spent his summers and where he wrote Emancipation Proclamation</p>

        <p>The summer cottage where President Lincoln sought solitude and relief from the pressures of office was also the place where he wrote the Emancipation Proclamation, the most important document of his administration. Anderson Cottage, four miles north of the Capitol, has served as a summer home for at least five other presidents. It was a particular favorite of Lincoln, who would spend summer afternoons reading underneath the canopy of a copper beech tree that still stands by the cottage.</p>
        <p>If any house is deserving of rescue it is this one, and it is thus heartening to learn that the National Trust For Historic Preservation is raising money from private sources to repair the cottage and add new facilities, including an education center. There is already $750,000 in public money in hand, drawn from the Save America's Treasures program, which is underwritten by Congress.</p>

        <p>The summer cottage where President Lincoln sought solitude and relief from the pressures of office was also the place where he wrote the Emancipation Proclamation, the most important document of his administration. Anderson Cottage, four miles north of the Capitol, has served as a summer home for at least five other presidents. It was a particular favorite of Lincoln, who would spend summer afternoons reading underneath the canopy of a copper beech tree that still stands by the cottage.</p>
        <p>If any house is deserving of rescue it is this one, and it is thus heartening to learn that the National Trust For Historic Preservation is raising money from private sources to repair the cottage and add new facilities, including an education center. There is already $750,000 in public money in hand, drawn from the Save America's Treasures program, which is underwritten by Congress.</p>
        <p>The 14-room house, in Early Gothic Revival style, currently serves as an office for the United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home and is therefore federal property. Its use as office space, its general neglect and Washington's legendary humidity have damaged the cottage over the years, and leaking radiator pipes are threatening its interior woodwork.</p>
        <p>The money, as well as President Clinton's recent designation of the house as a national monument, will protect a 157-year-old landmark and allow the general public to share its history. As an important link to the Lincoln era, the cottage's accessibility to the public is of fundamental educational and national significance.</p>
        <p>The effort also reflects well on the whole idea of public-private partnerships. Save America's Treasures is run jointly by the White House Millennium Council, established by Hillary Rodham Clinton two years ago, and the National Trust. Altogether the council plans to contribute $30 million in federal money this year to help preserve 71 endangered historical sites, and the National Trust a similar amount. Together they will do much to sustain some of the nation's most compelling pieces of history.</p>
