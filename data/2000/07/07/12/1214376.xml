        <p>ALL that Tom Ott wanted was to do what he considered the right thing. He didn't realize his homosexuality would get in the way.</p>
        <p>He had heard on the radio that scores of hospitals in and around New York City were caught in a severe, even alarming, blood shortage. That was on the Fourth of July. Being a red-blooded sort, he called the New York Blood Center the next day offering his veins for the tapping.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Ott, a 46-year-old social worker living in Brooklyn, remembered that he had become awfully woozy the last time he gave blood. He asked his partner of 18 years to pick him up at the blood bank.</p>
        <p>''I don't think you can give blood,'' the partner told him. ''I said, 'Why not?' '' Mr. Ott recalled. ''And he said, ''Because you're gay.' So I called the 800 number again'' -- the number for would-be donors, by the way, is (800) 933-BLOOD -- ''and asked if it's true that gays can't give.''</p>
        <p>The woman who answered the phone asked if he'd ''had sex with someone of the same sex since 1977.'' Yes, Mr. Ott said. ''Then you're deferred from donating,'' she replied.</p>
        <p>''Deferred'' struck him as a polite, but misleading, bureaucratic locution. ''Banned'' was more like it. Mr. Ott did not understand.</p>
        <p>He has not tested positive for H.I.V., the AIDS-causing virus, he said. His personal life is, if anything, ''pretty tame.'' Even if a problem with his blood turned up, he added, screening techniques should be amply sophisticated to spot it.</p>
        <p>''It blew me away,'' Mr. Ott said. ''I could see this attitude in the late 70's or 80's, when the AIDS epidemic was starting. But now? I just couldn't believe something like this still exists.''</p>
        <p>Even at the New York Blood Center, which supplies blood to 200 hospitals in the New York area, some officials question the tight restrictions placed on certain would-be donors, including any man who has had even a single homosexual encounter in the last 23 years.</p>
        <p>The blood center, like its counterparts in other cities, also has a problem with a fairly new rule excluding people who spent a total of six months or more in Britain from 1980 to 1996. Behind this rule is concern about transmitting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of mad cow disease. But many experts consider the fear to be outsized, and the impact on available blood supplies to be quite serious.</p>
        <p>On all these matters, the decision is out of the blood center's hands. The ''deferrals'' -- there's that word again -- are imposed by the federal Food and Drug Administration, whose officials say that the policies are periodically reviewed, and will be again.</p>
        <p>Regarding the years-old ban on gay men, said Lenore Gelb, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, ''the question is how do you change it and know that you're not increasing the health risk.''</p>
        <p>Fair enough. It is a question not shrugged off by gay groups like the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. Keeping the nation's blood supply safe has to be the No. 1 priority. On that score, federal health agencies ''have done a remarkable job,'' said Doni Gewirtzman, a Lambda staff lawyer.</p>
        <p>But the problem, as he sees it, is that the existing policy ''fails to treat like risks alike.'' Certainly, there is no shortage of donor-eligible heterosexuals running around with the AIDS virus. When it comes to gays, Mr. Gewirtzman said, ''they tell you to have safe sex, yet when you do, they say that you still can't give blood.''</p>
        <p>AT stake is not just a matter of equal rights. A more urgent, and arguably more important, issue is whether a large pool of potential donors is being needlessly excluded at a time when the New York Blood Center says it is in crisis.</p>
        <p>It prefers to have a five-day supply of blood on hand, about 14,000 pints. Because of high demand and low donation rates, ''we've been struggling in the last couple of weeks with a one- or two-day supply,'' said Dr. Robert L. Jones, the center's president.</p>
        <p>''If we don't have a pickup in donations, we will soon drop below a one-day supply,'' Dr. Jones warned. ''It's not a good situation for public safety.''</p>
        <p>That being the case, it is not surprising that some people ask if every one of the present bans is absolutely necessary. They wonder if, with proper testing of donated blood, a few federal restrictions may be eased and the common weal still preserved.</p>
        <p>These people are not bleeding hearts. They just want see as much blood as is needed flowing into hospital operating rooms.</p>
        <p>And if there is a change, Tom Ott says he is ready to give.</p>
