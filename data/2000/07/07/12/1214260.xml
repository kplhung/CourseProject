        <p>THE big news in the California wine country two years ago was the victorious conclusion to the 15-year, multimillion-dollar war against phylloxera, a parasite killer that eventually wiped out some 50,000 acres of  prime California vineyard land.</p>
        <p>The diseased vines were uprooted and burned and new ones planted, at enormous cost. One winemaker, the Robert Mondavi Winery in the Napa Valley, reported that replanting its vineyards cost $50 million.</p>
        <p>The hard-won celebrations may have been premature. By 1997, another predator had emerged in the state's southernmost vineyards and begun to spread northward with astonishing speed and frightening results. Called Pierce's disease, it is a bacterium spread by a tiny flying insect called the glassy-winged sharpshooter. The insect implants the bacteria in a vine when it feeds on the stem, and within several weeks, the vine dies.</p>
        <p>Several prominent wineries have shut down vineyards or parts of vineyards because of Pierce's disease, among them Callaway Vineyards and Winery in Temecula, in Southern California, and Bonny Doon Vineyard, in the Santa Cruz Mountains.</p>
        <p>There is no cure for the disease, which kills vines by preventing them from absorbing water and nutrients. And there is no effective method to stop this particular sharpshooter, which one scientist, at a meeting of Napa Valley growers, called ''stunningly voracious.''</p>
        <p>Wine and wine grapes are a $33-billion-a-year industry in California. The state estimates that damage from Pierce's disease in the last two years was worth $6 million, none of which seems to have been passed on to the consumer. Yet. But the future is anyone's guess.</p>
        <p>Actually, California grape growers have been contending with Pierce's disease for more than a century. It was first identified near Anaheim in 1892, when it wiped out some 40,000 acres of grapevines over a period of years. For a time it was known as the Anaheim disease.</p>
        <p>A century ago and, in fact, until three years ago, the carrier was the blue-green sharpshooter, an insect that thrives near rivers and streams. The disease was usually controlled by replanting and by moving vines away from streams or ponds.</p>
        <p>The glassy-winged sharpshooter is a more dangerous relative: according to scientists at the University of California at Davis, this sharpshooter can fly higher and farther than the blue-green and can consume huge amounts of plant sap a day, the equivalent of a 150-pound human's drinking 4,300 gallons of liquid. Patrick Gleason, the director of the American Vineyard Foundation in Napa, calls it ''the pterodactyl of sharpshooters.''</p>
        <p>The glassy-winged sharpshooter is thought to have entered California a decade ago on ornamental plants shipped from Florida nurseries. The insect thrives in the country's warmer regions, which is one reason why European grape varieties like cabernet sauvignon, merlot and chardonnay have never succeeded in Florida and other Southeastern states. Because of the sharpshooter, Pierce's disease has also become a serious problem for Texas vineyards.</p>
        <p>Its current resurgence in California has been most pronounced in the south where, according to the state's Food and Agriculture Department, it has been found in San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, Orange and Santa Barbara Counties. In Temecula, in Riverside County, the disease has wiped out nearly one-third of the wine grape vineyards in the 3,000-acre growing area.</p>
        <p>Both Napa and Monterey Counties are considering a nursery certification program for ornamental and other plants purchased elsewhere. ''We are advocating that all nursery stock from the infested counties be inspected,'' said Corky Roche, a vineyard consultant based in Salinas and a member of a state task force studying Pierce's disease.</p>
        <p>The most vulnerable grapevines are chardonnay, which is the state's most widely planted fine wine variety, and pinot noir, which has been growing in popularity in recent years. Temecula and Riverside Counties are particularly vulnerable because they also have large groves of citrus fruits, and the sharpshooter likes to lay its eggs in the leaves of citrus trees.</p>
        <p>The state's premier wine regions -- Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino Counties, in Northern California -- have yet to encounter the glassy-winged sharpshooter. Two weeks ago, the Napa Valley was officially declared free of the insect by the Food and Agriculture Department.</p>
        <p>''We are worried,'' said Ed Weber, an agricultural agent in Napa County for the University of California. ''The insect is moving north -- it's been found in Tulare and Fresno Counties.</p>
        <p>''Pierce's disease is an ongoing problem here in Napa,'' Mr. Weber continued, ''and over the years we've had a lot of losses. But only with the blue-green insect.''</p>
        <p>Meeting with growers and winemakers in March, Gov. Gray Davis said he would sponsor legislation to provide $6.9 million in state funds each year for the next two years and would seek another $7.1 million in federal help to fight Pierce's disease. Last year, the California Assembly  appropriated $750,000 a year for three years for research, contingent on an annual commitment of $250,000 from the California wine and grape industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weber says that shipments of ornamental plants often present serious problems because they often carry the bug's eggs. ''But how do you inspect all the plants?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>For now, he says, Pierce's disease is primarily being fought by inspecting imported plants. Officials are trying to destroy the sharpshooter eggs by spraying citrus trees with insecticides, and a plan to introduce an insect called the fairy wasp, which destroys the eggs, into infected areas, is being considered.</p>
        <p>At the moment, the only effective response may be what Callaway has done: buy grapes elsewhere. George Rose, a spokesman for the winery, said Callaway was about to introduce a line of wines made from grapes purchased in the Central Coast area, well north of Temecula, where there is no Pierce's disease. At least, not yet.</p>
