      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says summer school attendance in New York City is disappointingly low this year despite efforts of Harold Levy, schools chancellor, to avoid mistakes made in 1999; supports him in calling on Gov Pataki and State Legislature to make summer school mandatory for those who need it</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Last year's mandatory summer school for public school students who failed year-end promotion examinations was chaotic and poorly managed. But the New York City schools chancellor, Harold Levy, has learned from the mistakes of his predecessor, thus far avoiding the staffing, transportation and record-keeping problems that proved so embarrassing a year ago. Even so, summer school attendance is disappointingly low -- and is unlikely to improve until the Legislature changes the state education code to make summer school attendance mandatory for students who fail during the regular school year.</p>
        <p>Summer school in the city was expanded last year as part of a new policy prohibiting ''social promotion'' for children in grades three through eight, who had historically been passed on to the next level without demonstrating the necessary skills. The task of teaching these students last summer was hampered by staff and supply shortages, as well as by shoddy record-keeping that made it impossible even to know which students showed up. This summer an electronic scanning system allows the schools to compile daily attendance figures. Despite fears of a teacher shortage, the system managed to recruit more teachers than needed. In addition, a bigger state subsidy supports a more effective transportation network to get students to school.</p>

        <p>Summer school in the city was expanded last year as part of a new policy prohibiting ''social promotion'' for children in grades three through eight, who had historically been passed on to the next level without demonstrating the necessary skills. The task of teaching these students last summer was hampered by staff and supply shortages, as well as by shoddy record-keeping that made it impossible even to know which students showed up. This summer an electronic scanning system allows the schools to compile daily attendance figures. Despite fears of a teacher shortage, the system managed to recruit more teachers than needed. In addition, a bigger state subsidy supports a more effective transportation network to get students to school.</p>
        <p>Despite its problems, the 1999 summer session proved valuable. Of the students sent to summer school for failing reading tests, nearly 64 percent passed the test at the end of the summer. Of those who initially failed the math test, more than 61 percent passed after summer instruction. In addition, students who were held back despite summer school showed dramatic improvement during the following year.</p>
        <p>This year's better-organized summer school can be more beneficial, if all the students who should attend actually show up. More than a third of the students who were referred to summer school for failing year-end promotion tests have simply not appeared. Chancellor Levy is right to ask Gov. George Pataki and the State Legislature to make summer school mandatory for those who need it.</p>
