        <p>The migration from Edmonton to New York continues. Ron Low, a former Oiler player and coach, will be appointed the head coach of the Rangers today, a little more than a month after Glen Sather moved from Edmonton to become the Rangers' president and general manager.</p>
        <p>The 50-year-old Low, who coached the Houston Aeros in the International Hockey League last season, will be introduced today with his two new assistants, Ted Green and Walt Kyle, at a news conference at Madison Square Garden. While Low and Sather are inheriting a daunting task -- the Rangers have not qualified for the playoffs the past three seasons -- they will begin by restoring one of the links to the Stanley Cup season of 1994 by bringing back the free agent Mark Messier.</p>
        <p>The signing of the 39-year-old Messier is imminent, and could be announced at the Garden as soon as tomorrow, but only if the Rangers and the Messiers could work out the final details of a contract last night, a person with knowledge of the contract negotiations said yesterday. If not, the person said, Messier and his father and agent, Doug, were scheduled to go on a family fishing trip in the Caribbean, which would delay the announcement until next week.</p>
        <p>Once Messier signs, he will be greeted by many familiar faces in the front office, as well as in the dressing room.</p>
        <p>Low was Sather's coach in Edmonton for four-plus seasons, beginning with the final 13 games of the lockout-shortened 1995 season. Low's Oilers teams went 139-162-40. They never finished a season with a winning record (something the Rangers have not done since Messier left). But Low's teams did qualify for the playoffs in each of his last three seasons in Edmonton.</p>
        <p>Low -- who is known as a players' coach -- stepped down from his post after the 1998-99 season after Sather could not guarantee him a raise from the cash-strapped group that owns the Oilers. In New York, Sather is operating under no such financial restraints. According to one league official, Low's deal with the Rangers is believed to be worth about $700,000 per season for three seasons.</p>
        <p>When reached at his Manhattan hotel last night and asked if he would comment about today's news conference, Low chuckled and said: ''Not yet.''</p>
        <p>Sather is bringing both Green and Kyle with him from the Edmonton organization, too. Green, who spent 14 seasons on the Edmonton coaching staff, including two as an assistant to Low, was the head coach of the Oilers for parts of three seasons, from 1991-92 into 1993-94. His teams went 65-102-21 and made the playoffs once, in 1991-92, the season after they won their fifth and final Stanley Cup under Sather. Kyle, meanwhile, a former assistant coach under Ron Wilson at Anaheim, spent the past two seasons coaching Edmonton's top minor-league affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs of the American Hockey League.</p>
        <p>The 60-year-old Green, according to the league official, is believed to have agreed to a deal that will pay him $400,000 per season. Kyle, who has successfully defeated cancer twice, will be paid $250,000.</p>
        <p>Only three players remain from the 1994 team that Messier led to the Stanley Cup: Brian Leetch, Mike Richter and Adam Graves. Those three and Darren Langdon are the only current Rangers remaining from Messier's last season with the team, when the Rangers advanced to the Eastern Conference finals in 1997.</p>
        <p>Low, Messier's former teammate in Edmonton, was a goaltender for six National Hockey League teams from 1972 to '85.</p>
        <p>Sather, who flew to New York from Banff, Alberta, yesterday, was unavailable for comment. But Mike Keenan did say that Sather had phoned him yesterday afternoon -- and left a message -- that fulfilled Sather's promise that he would try to speak to Keenan once more before the Rangers selected a coach.</p>
        <p>Keenan, who said he had spoken to Messier earlier this week -- not to talk about the Rangers' job, but to see how Messier was doing, Keenan said -- expressed disappointment that he did not get the Rangers' job that he left after winning the cup with Messier in 1994.</p>
        <p>''But what can you do?'' Keenan said.</p>
        <p>At the least, Sather did Keenan a favor by putting his name back in the coaching circles. Keenan has struggled to find coaching interviews since being fired from his last coaching job, with Messier and the Vancouver Canucks, in the middle of the 1998-99 season.</p>
