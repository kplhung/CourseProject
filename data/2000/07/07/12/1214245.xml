        <p>After 14 years as an agent for the Allstate Insurance Company, Gene Romero thought he had mastered the art of keeping quiet. When the company required him to work weekends, he says, he did not complain. When it cut back on office help and had him do his own paperwork, he uttered no protest. At 51, Mr. Romero thought that his silence would pave the way to an easy retirement.</p>
        <p>The job had been a good one. Though most big insurance companies have long relied on independent contractors to sell their policies, Allstate was among the few to hire agents as employees with benefits, arousing a fierce loyalty from its sale force.</p>
        <p>But last November, Mr. Romero, in Kansas City, Mo., and about 6,000 other employee agents were told that their jobs would be terminated on June 30, their benefits canceled and their pensions frozen. They could stay with Allstate and earn higher commissions, but only as independent contractors who paid their own expenses, got no benefits and could be dismissed at any time. Or they could leave, taking a severance package or selling their business to fellow agents. In all cases, the agents had to waive their rights to sue the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romero signed the waiver and sold his business. But all he could think about, he says, was how difficult it would be to find a new job with the same security and perquisites. ''I felt betrayed,'' he said. ''Ever since I have been with Allstate, they've always said the agent is the backbone of the company, but now they've changed their story.''</p>
        <p>In March, Mr. Romero filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over the waiver, starting a feud that has spread around the country. Since then, at least 50 agents have filed similar complaints, contending that Allstate, the nation's second-largest insurance company after State Farm, violated federal law by forcing them to surrender their civil rights to keep their jobs.</p>
        <p>The commission has yet to rule, but it calls the number of complaints fairly large and cause for concern, considering how rarely discontented employees overcome fear of repercussion and take action.</p>
        <p>The dispute is the latest skirmish in a long-simmering conflict over the use of independent contractors in the American workplace. The practice has long been scrutinized by the Internal Revenue Service because it enables businesses to escape payroll taxes, and labor unions attack it as a means for employers to evade benefits like pensions, sick pay and paid vacations.</p>
        <p>But independent contractors have become an increasingly popular option for businesses in recent years, in part because Congress pressured the I.R.S. to scale back its 20 restrictions governing their use.</p>
        <p>After paying severance packages and higher commissions, Allstate says the move is actually costing the company money. As independent contractors, though, agents will be free from the many restrictions typically imposed on employees, the company says, allowing them greater flexibility in an increasingly competitive marketplace that has been recast by the Internet.</p>
        <p>The disgruntled agents, Allstate adds, are but a small fraction of the thousands who have stayed with the company. Hundreds of agents were so bullish on their prospects that they bought out departing employees, the company says.</p>
        <p>''People are not investing large sums of money into a company that they are not happy about,'' said Barry L. Hutton, a vice president for sales for Allstate, which is based in Northbrook, Ill.</p>
        <p>But many agents say they agreed only reluctantly to remain, in hopes of preserving careers that span 10 to 20 years or more. To them, the waiver represents the collapse of a relationship that was once the envy of the industry.</p>
        <p>''I went with a company that I thought would be there for me,'' said Leanne McCurley, 52, an agent of 17 years in Brookings, Ore., who also filed an E.E.O.C. complaint. Before joining the company, Ms. McCurley read employee surveys indicating a 99 percent satisfaction rate among Allstate agents. Skeptical, she herself interviewed about 20 agents, all of whom poured out praise for the company.</p>
        <p>Morale only rose in the mid-1980's after Allstate ventured beyond its box-like booths at Sears department stores to set up neighborhood branches. With allowances provided by Allstate, agents could rent offices, advertise and build their own customer bases with virtual autonomy.</p>
        <p>''It was like having your own business, but completely without the risk,'' said Dick Roberts, 54, who left the company in May after 26 years in Lewiston, Idaho.</p>
        <p>But the office allowance remained flat, agents contend, and as inflation drove their costs up, many began dipping into their own pockets. Then, Allstate began cutting back on its support staff, leaving agents to take up the paperwork slack. Some brought in their spouses to help at no pay. Others hired staff at their own expense.</p>
        <p>To recoup costs, many agents began deducting the expenses on their income tax returns, a common practice for independent contractors. But in 1998 the I.R.S. ordered them to stop the practice to retain their status as employees.</p>
        <p>Company officials say that the productivity of its employee agents began to fall at that point. Without the flexibility to invest in their businesses, the agents could no longer compete with Allstate's corps of about 9,000 independent contractors.</p>
        <p>To bolster sales, Allstate then ordered offices to be open for set hours every day except Sunday, putting a huge burden on agents who worked alone.</p>
        <p>''If I went to lunch and closed my office, if I went on vacation, if I was sick and couldn't go to work, I was told I would be fired,'' Mr. Roberts said.</p>
        <p>Despite growing tensions, many agents say they remained with the company for fear of losing their benefits, especially their pensions, since most of them are over 45.</p>
        <p>Now the pensions are frozen, meaning that the accounts accrue no interest or additional contributions from the company. Nor can employees take the money and invest it elsewhere until after they turn 65.</p>
        <p>Some agents also say that the new commissions are lower than the industry average and hardly offset the cost of going into business for themselves. ''We were in good hands up until now,'' Ms. McCurley said. ''Then somebody dropped us.''</p>
