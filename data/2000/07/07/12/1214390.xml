        <p>The president of Chaminade High School last night assembled the students who survived a fatal highway accident in Arizona for a pastoral counseling session and a debriefing about what they had seen before a summer sightseeing tour ended in a crash that killed a student and a mathematics teacher.</p>
        <p>The accounts of the students suggested that driver fatigue had not caused the crash, said the Rev. James C. Williams, the school's president. That had been the early speculation by Arizona public safety officials.</p>
        <p>Brother John Zarzycki, the teacher who died in the crash, had only been at the wheel of the 15-seat van for an hour and a half, the students reported, after a half-hour break. In addition, Father Williams said at a news conference today, both drivers ''had a good night's rest'' in a Las Vegas hotel. ''It was not a camping night,'' Father Williams said. ''I know Brother went to bed early.''</p>
        <p>The students said that Brother Zarzycki, 38, had complained earlier of feeling ill and had taken an antacid, Father Williams said. ''Some type of indigestion was what he claimed,'' Father Williams said.</p>
        <p>During his break from driving, Brother Zarzycki ate and had some Gatorade. Just before getting back on the road, headed for the Grand Canyon, he announced he felt much better. As he drove, true to form, he joked with the students. ''In terms of his attentiveness, his wit was still about him at that point in time,'' Father Williams said.</p>
        <p>According to the students, the van moved toward the center line of the two-lane road, perhaps to avoid something in its path. It rolled over and came to a stop on the gravel shoulder, all four tires blown out. It was drizzling at the time.</p>
        <p>''Brother struggled to control the van,'' Father Williams said the students told him.</p>
        <p>Brendan Tracy, 16, the yearbook editor and volleyball player who also died in the crash, was in the rear of the van, not wearing a seat belt.</p>
        <p>A funeral Mass for Brendan and Brother Zarzycki will be held Friday at 10 a.m. in the school auditorium. Meanwhile, an investigation will continue into the cause of the accident.</p>
        <p>Father Williams described the teenagers as ''rollercoastering'' through a series of emotions, including humor. He cited the two students  who were injured and spent one night in an Arizona hospital, then returned to New York by private jet.</p>
        <p>Though one suffered a deep wound to the leg and the other had a minor back injury, the trip home was an adventure.</p>
        <p>''One of the them said to me, 'Father, the jet ride back was great,' '' the school president said.</p>
        <p>Other students suggested they might write a book about their experience, a ''Chicken Soup for the Soul,'' Father Williams said. ''That's the attitude that's there.''</p>
