        <p>BLACK ANGEL  The Life of Arshile Gorky  By Nouritza Matossian  576 pages. The Overlook Press. $40.</p>
        <p>One of these days Arshile Gorky, the great, and first, Abstract Expressionist, will get the biography he deserves, but it won't be easy. Gorky, born Manoug Adoian in the western Armenian province of Van around 1904, was a flamboyant dissembler. The Turks' genocidal campaign from 1915 to 1918 wiped out much of his family and his past and made ''starving Armenian'' a painfully familiar phrase. Fiercely private, Adoian re-created himself as a Russian, a cousin of Maxim Gorky, a student of Kandinsky and a graduate of Brown University.</p>
        <p>His arrival in the United States in 1919 was followed by an arduous and willful artistic metamorphosis. He took what he needed from Cezanne, Picasso, Ingres and Goya, often by copying paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He then forged a fabulously synthetic yet original style inspired by the art of Miro, Surrealist automatism, his childhood memories of the Armenian landscape and two crucial summers spent in the lush countryside of northern Virginia. As has been widely acknowledged, his paintings laid the foundation for Abstract Expressionism.</p>
        <p>Gorky committed suicide in 1948  after losses that echoed his youth -- a devastating studio fire, the diagnosis a few weeks later of advanced cancer, and painful injuries suffered in a car accident while driving with his dealer, Julien Levy. The last straw was estrangement from his wife, Agnes, worn down by poverty, the care of two young children and Gorky's incommunicativeness and jealousy.</p>
        <p>Since his death, an understanding of Gorky's achievement has often been hindered by mistrust, recrimination, feuding and amateur or partisan writing. Friends and family alike have often perpetuated Gorky's fictions and sometimes added to them. Despite such challenges, Gorky biographies are on the verge of becoming an annual event. Last summer brought ''From a High Place: A Life of Arshile Gorky,'' by Matthew Spender, a writer and the husband of Gorky's elder daughter, Maro. An often tedious book that rarely did justice to Gorky's art, it nonetheless provided the first detailed and measured account of his epic life, clearing up decades of mystery and misinformation while revealing some of the complex psychological pressures and conflicts that drove Gorky.</p>
        <p>Now comes a book that makes the shortcomings of Mr. Spender's effort seem relatively minor: Nouritza Matossian's 500-page ''Black Angel: The Life of Arshile Gorky,'' a shambling, argumentative if impassioned retelling that slips and slides all over Gorky's life, often casting it back into the haze while bringing his art weirdly to life.</p>
        <p>Ms. Matossian, who lives in London and has written a biography of the composer Iannis Xenakis, is the first Armenian to attempt a full-scale biography of Gorky. She conducted lengthy interviews with his sister, Vartoosh Mooradian, before her death and was able to read Gorky's letters in the original. She seems to have done a lot of field work. Her book is studded with personal reminiscences, some published here for the first time, of people from all phases of his life. She revisited the places of his childhood and is well versed in Armenian art.</p>
        <p>But she approaches her task with a pronounced agenda, which is to make Gorky the savior of lost Armenian culture, the succor of Armenian pain. She continually relates his mature work to his childhood experiences, many of which are conjectural in the first place; gives lengthy biographical or religious interpretations of his semiabstract forms; and connects his motifs to the illuminated manuscripts, carved tombstones and church frescoes of Armenian culture. (''He did not have to borrow from Africa or the South Pacific like other artists,'' she writes.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Matossian's second agenda, which is increasingly irritating as the book wears on, is to be the savior of Gorky. Thus she discounts most American critics of the period and glosses over or ignores the work of other scholars with interests similar to hers, including Harry Rand's heavily interpretive ''Arshile Gorky: The Implications of Symbols'' from 1981.</p>
        <p>Ms. Matossian's strength is a kind of visual reverie. She has an unusual knack for describing the formal and the physical aspects of a painting or drawing, the way shapes build and surfaces accrue, which befits an artist as technically obsessed yet as improvisational as Gorky. Some of the most engaging passages of this book are descriptions of paintings, although one tires of the paucity of corroborating illustrations. She is also good at creating a sense of the special way artists see, of the way they look at the landscape and examine other art. When she begins to ascend into the interpretive stratosphere, one is sometimes willing to go with her, even against one's better judgment.</p>
        <p>Details like facts seem almost beneath Ms. Matossian, and her editors as well. Wilfredo Lam is first Haitian, then Cuban; New York museums include the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of Modern Art. And her relentlessly melodramatic tone ends up blunting the true and horrible drama of her subject's life. Her Gorky walks this book like a movie hero -- or the subject of a Hollywood biography. He looks great and sounds great and casts a big shadow, but the backgrounds and people around him remain uniformly vague, his relationships cursory, his inner life unexplored.</p>
        <p>Ultimately Ms. Matossian herself seems to be the book's main character. She likes to make inflammatory characterizations in passing, describing Le Corbusier, for example,  as ''a womanizer who covered architects' plans with doodles of women's protruding buttocks.'' She seems caught up in old rivalries, like that between Gorky and Pollock. Lee Krasner's brief appearance during a trip to Provincetown is footnoted thus: ''Curiously, when Lee Krasner was interviewed on Gorky she did not mention this holiday with him, perhaps because she was not with Pollock at the time.''</p>
        <p>And everywhere, the immense hurt of Gorky's life and afterlife, surrogate for the larger Armenian tragedy, is furiously protected. At a party where Gorky danced, as he often did, ''A photograph was snapped so writers could lampoon him later for pretending to be a peasant dancer.'' By the end of this book, Ms. Matossian's agenda has become an enormous chip on her own shoulder, one that, for all her enormous effort, does Gorky more harm than good.</p>
