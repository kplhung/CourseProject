        <p>Celebrity and politics collided today on Capitol Hill, as a rock musician joined online music executives and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss the effects on the recording industry of downloading music from the Internet.</p>
        <p>Lars Ulrich, the drummer for the heavy-metal band Metallica, found what may have been an unexpected ally in Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and chairman of the committee.</p>
        <p>''Fair and reasonable licensing needs to take place; that is what I'm hearing,'' Mr. Hatch said at the conclusion of a three-hour hearing.</p>
        <p>The meeting room was packed with young spectators, spilling into the hallway of the Hart Senate Building. Hundreds lined up to get a view of Mr. Ulrich, or perhaps to gain some insight into the clash between the recording industry and online music outlets.</p>
        <p>The Recording Industry Association of America, which represents major record labels, and several music groups have argued that software created by the online music start-up Napster permits individuals to steal copyrighted material. Officials for the service, and their fans, contend that it simply allows for easy sharing and sampling of music.</p>
        <p>To use the Napster service, which is free, users download software over the Internet that allows them to store and catalog their music on their own computers. Napster posts those catalogs, and then enables users of the service to visit one another's computers over the Internet and share and download one another's music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ulrich said that ''if music is free for downloading, the music industry is not viable.'' Napster, he said, had ''hijacked'' his music.</p>
        <p>''Like a carpenter who crafts a table gets to decide whether to keep it, sell it or give it away, shouldn't we have the same options?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>In April, Metallica and the rapper Dr. Dre sued Napster for copyright infringement. A federal judge in Manhattan ruled this spring that another online music database, MP3.com, had violated copyright laws; the company has since settled with two labels.</p>
        <p>But Congress has been reluctant to interfere in the private marketplace. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and the ranking minority member of the committee, said the intellectual property generated in the United States was ''the envy of the world.'' Mr. Leahy, who kept an open laptop computer in front of him throughout the hearing, noted that millions of young voters are paying close attention to the debate on intellectual property and the need for certain safeguards.</p>
        <p>''History has shown that when new technologies emerge, they may initially seem to threaten to trump intellectual property protection,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''In the end, things get sorted out.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Leahy said that it is important both to ''protect the legitimate right'' of artists and to reward them for their work.</p>
        <p>Hank Barry, the chief executive of Napster, based in San Mateo, Calif., said the company's Web site had attracted nearly 20 million users. And he said that Napster was helping, not hurting the recording industry. People are buying more records, he said, because they are able to sample and preview music before buying.</p>
        <p>''Companies that hold copyrights on behalf of creators, and which control distribution of creative works, have a strong inclination to change copyright law from a balanced vehicle for public enrichment to an unbalanced engine of control,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barry said copyright holders were often reluctant to allow new technologies to emerge. But, he said, innovations like radio, television, the cassette player and the videocassette recorder have ''proved to be a financial boon to these same concerned copyright holders.''</p>
        <p>Rather than legislation from Congress, Mr. Barry called for a ''market-based solution that will benefit consumers.'' Others who testified today agreed. Fred Ehrlich, president of new technology for Sony Music Entertainment, a unit of the Sony Corporation, said the ''private market will set itself right.''</p>
        <p>Gene Hoffman Jr., president of Emusic.com, which charges and pays royalties to artists for recordings on the Internet, said that the government should strive to be more effective in enforcing current copyright laws. And Roger McGuinn, of the folk-rock group the Byrds, said that the issue was ''a lot of worrying about nothing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ulrich, however, remained steadfast on legislative intervention. ''I think we're dreaming if you think we can work this out ourselves,'' he said. ''The differences are too deep on too many levels.''</p>
        <p>As the debate entered the Senate, a group called Artists Against Piracy ran full-page advertisements today in several major newspapers. The coalition supports the stance taken by Mr. Ulrich and members of Metallica in favor of protecting intellectual property rights. Corporate donors to the group include the National Association of Recording Merchandisers, the Recording Industry Association of America and the Walt Disney Company.</p>
