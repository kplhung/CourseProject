        <p>A federal judge yesterday ordered Willie E.

        <p>Details of the settlement are expected to be announced in October. The company said on June 14 that it had reached a settlement ''in principle,'' and would turn to specialists to work out issues including the size of the cash payments to plaintiffs. The settlement extends to all current and former black salaried Coke employees who have worked at the company since April 1995, and is expected to include policy changes inside the company as well as cash. The plaintiffs contended that they were denied promotions, raises and other advancement because of their race.</p>

        <p>A federal judge yesterday ordered Willie E. Gary, a Florida lawyer who is representing four black former Coca-Cola employees in a racial-discrimination lawsuit against the company, not to interfere with the settlement reached last month between Coke and four other employees with similar claims.</p>
        <p>Details of the settlement are expected to be announced in October. The company said on June 14 that it had reached a settlement ''in principle,'' and would turn to specialists to work out issues including the size of the cash payments to plaintiffs. The settlement extends to all current and former black salaried Coke employees who have worked at the company since April 1995, and is expected to include policy changes inside the company as well as cash. The plaintiffs contended that they were denied promotions, raises and other advancement because of their race.</p>
        <p>In a two-page ruling issued late yesterday, the judge overseeing the case, Richard W. Story of Federal District Court in Atlanta, prohibited Mr. Gary and his firm from soliciting employees who would be covered by the settlement to sign retainers that would give Mr. Gary's firm a percentage of any cash award from the settlement.</p>
        <p>The judge also ordered Mr. Gary and his firm not to discuss the lawsuit with employees unless the employees initiated the discussion, and prohibited him from communicating with any named or prospective class member directly or through public statements.</p>
        <p>The ruling was in response to a motion made on June 29 by Cyrus Mehri, the lead lawyer in the federal racial-discrimination lawsuit filed against Coke in April of last year. Mr. Gary filed a discrimination lawsuit against Coke, seeking $1.5 billion in damages, in Georgia state court last month. Mr. Gary is also representing four plaintiffs who originally were represented by Mr. Mehri in the federal lawsuit.</p>
        <p>In the motion, Mr. Mehri said Mr. Gary had been trying to persuade black employees to sign agreements that would give the Gary firm 25 percent of any class-action settlement the individuals receive. Some employees have said they will opt out of the settlement because Mr. Gary told them he could get them larger cash awards.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Coke said the company had no comment. Mr. Gary and his assistant did not return telephone messages seeking comment.</p>
