        <p>It seems only a video-replay moment ago: the Liberty was playing the Charlotte Sting in the decisive game of the two-of-three-game Eastern Conference finals at Madison Square Garden. The Liberty won the game, only to lose the Women's National Basketball Association championship to the Houston Comets.</p>
        <p>Tonight, the Liberty and the Sting will face each other for the first time since that eventful Aug. 30 evening, and changes in circumstance and lineups have given the two teams a different look and feel. In fact, the two teams, which at the end of last season appeared likely contenders for this year's conference title, are heading in opposite directions.</p>
        <p>After a frustrating start, the Liberty (10-9) is squarely in the playoff hunt. New York enters tonight's game on a three-game winning streak, a game above .500 for the first time this season and only a half-game out of second place in the East.</p>
        <p>Charlotte (3-16), a team expected to finish second or third in the conference, has lost eight of its last nine games and is in last place.</p>
        <p>A year ago, the Sting was the younger, bigger and quicker team with confident inside play from Rhonda Mapp and Vicky Bullett. With the pesky All-Star point guard Dawn Staley, a member of the 2000 United States women's Olympic basketball team, Charlotte had a slight edge in the backcourt over New York and Teresa Weatherspoon, the Liberty's All-Star floor leader.</p>
        <p>But Staley missed the entire preseason recovering from knee surgery, Bullett was traded to Washington for Shalonda Enis, who has spent most of the season on injured reserve, and T. R. Dunn was hired to replace Dan Hughes, the interim coach. The Sting appears stung by the myriad changes.</p>
        <p>The Liberty, meanwhile, has added youth, quickness and perimeter scoring depth to its starting lineup.</p>
        <p>Tari Phillips, acquired in a trade from the Portland Fire, has given the Liberty mobility and scoring in the low post. Tamika Whitmore, the 6-foot-2-inch rookie sensation a season ago, has regained the favor and confidence of Coach Richie Adubato and will start at power forward.</p>
        <p>Whitmore, who came to camp 42 pounds overweight, is now playing the 24 minutes per game Adubato had expected of her and contributes a presence on the boards. Becky Hammon, the second-year pro likely to replace Weatherspoon one day as the team's floor leader, continues to provide a spark off the bench.</p>
        <p>After Charlotte took a one-game lead in last year's conference finals, the Sting's celebration before their home fans rankled New York. In the end, the Liberty sent Charlotte packing. The Liberty seems positioned to do the same tonight.</p>
