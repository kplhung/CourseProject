        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Recipe for Weaker Schools'' (editorial, July 7): Having seen three boys through college in the 1950's and 60's and observed local classrooms in the 90's when I read once a week to fourth and fifth graders, I can see two significant things missing today.</p>
        <p>''Falling through the cracks'' begins in elementary school. A return to an orderly classroom atmosphere -- calm, quiet, conducive to thinking and learning -- will narrow those cracks considerably. The reinstitution of discipline is a necessary prerequisite. Children want to know limits. They want to know someone cares, which putting limits tells them.</p>

        <p>Too many children today come from home atmospheres that are too hurried and harried. They might find the classroom to be the only island in life's storm.</p>
