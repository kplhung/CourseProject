        <p>AT Baldoria, your problem is automatically the problem of the owner, Frank Pellegrino Jr. He takes things personally, which is why a chance remark about the jukebox selections led to an instant summit conference at my booth. ''What would you like to hear?'' Mr. Pellegrino asked, whipping out a notebook and pen. Some Claudio Villa, perhaps. Or even some Carlo Buti. Actually, just about anything that might displace Neil Diamond and Mariah Carey. Mr. Pellegrino took notes furiously and promised to put his wife on the case immediately. ''She knows all these singers and brings back things from Italy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Baldoria is that kind of place. The kind of place where the owner pulls up a chair. The kind of place that sees nothing strange about installing a jukebox on both floors -- jukeboxes that demand good money to play the songs. The kind of place that, having installed the jukeboxes, sees nothing strange in putting Jimmy Rosselli right next to the Temptations.</p>

        <p>AT Baldoria, your problem is automatically the problem of the owner, Frank Pellegrino Jr. He takes things personally, which is why a chance remark about the jukebox selections led to an instant summit conference at my booth. ''What would you like to hear?'' Mr. Pellegrino asked, whipping out a notebook and pen. Some Claudio Villa, perhaps. Or even some Carlo Buti. Actually, just about anything that might displace Neil Diamond and Mariah Carey. Mr. Pellegrino took notes furiously and promised to put his wife on the case immediately. ''She knows all these singers and brings back things from Italy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Baldoria is that kind of place. The kind of place where the owner pulls up a chair. The kind of place that sees nothing strange about installing a jukebox on both floors -- jukeboxes that demand good money to play the songs. The kind of place that, having installed the jukeboxes, sees nothing strange in putting Jimmy Rosselli right next to the Temptations.</p>
        <p>Baldoria is a big slice of neighborhood Italian, New York style, transferred, in a slicker format, to the theater district. It is the offshoot of Rao's, the cult restaurant in East Harlem, owned by Mr. Pellegrino's father, that has achieved celebrity status in the narrow sense of the term. It is famous for being famous, in other words -- as well known to those who have never eaten there, which is almost everyone, as it is to the tiny band of regulars who hold on to tables for life there. ''I can't get in there, and I'm the manager here,'' said John Kaufman one evening. ''They won't even let me make deliveries there.''</p>
        <p>You can get into Baldoria, and it's a prime specimen of a special genre, the Italian-American restaurant. Italian restaurants, at least the good ones, specialize in a distinct regional cuisine, or perhaps a constellation of two or three related cuisines, and try to replicate real Italian surroundings. Italian-American restaurants ignore regional distinctions. They serve feel-good food in a feel-good atmosphere that inclines diners to overlook shortcomings. In restaurants like these, Frank Sinatra is more important than the chef.</p>
        <p>Baldoria is a little more sophisticated than that, but not a lot. It is authentic, even naive, and in an ironic, cynical age, that makes it tremendously appealing. Mr. Pellegrino radiates warmth and sweetness. He also looks a little confused, as though he can't quite believe that Baldoria (pronounced bal-DOR-ia; it means ''rollicking good time'') actually belongs to him. Maybe he's trying to figure out who hired the impressive doorman, who, when the mood strikes him, may even open the door. Or maybe Mr. Pellegrino is wondering how to break it to about half his customers that they really are not supposed to smoke at the tables.</p>
        <p>It is possible to eat very well at Baldoria, or not. Two diners at the same table on the same night could leave thinking they had been at two different restaurants. Diner No. 1, with a smile on his face, probably began with a fresh, vibrant salad of wild fennel and fava beans with two scoops of creamy ricotta, then moved on to a simple, and simply terrific, asparagus risotto, not overly rich or loaded down with butter and cheese. The main course, perhaps, was calf's liver alla Veneziana, as tender as sweetbreads, surrounded by sweet, vinegary fried onions.</p>
        <p>Diner No. 2 drew the short straw, starting with a bland escarole and bean soup, compounding the error with a second course of squishy gnocchi alla bolognese and finishing badly with a tough, overcooked, flavorless and misspelled veal piccata.</p>
        <p>When it's good, Baldoria is quite good, although never quite as good as the overenergized waiters seem to think and insistently tell you. Ordering can take on the character of negotiations at a used car lot. It takes character to prevail and get the meal you want, instead of the waiter's enthusiasms of the evening. But perseverance can pay off. The seafood salad, a generous pile of lobster, crab, squid and shrimp in an olive oil and lemon juice marinade, makes a simple, satisfying starter when not overcooked, which is half the time. The house salad, a brightly colored jumble of lettuce hearts, red onions, radicchio, fennel and cherry tomatoes, makes a crisp impression that carries through the entire menu.</p>
        <p>The greens and the tomatoes at Baldoria are always fresh and flavorful, and they do a lot to regain lost ground in dishes like the tough, overbreaded veal Milanese, topped with wonderfully pungent arugula, or the squishy gnocchi, which have a good bolognese sauce firmed up with San Marzano tomatoes. Pastas, too, perform strongly, especially trenette with prosciutto, peas and onions in a light cream sauce and good, firm papardelle with a dark, earthy mushroom sauce. Standard appetizers like vitello tonnato and clams sauteed in white wine are respectable, as are main courses like sweet sausages with pepper and onions.</p>
        <p>The veal can be vile. Osso buco struggles through, but veal in any other form, thick or thin, comes out dry and overcooked. That makes the veal T-bone with hot cherry peppers and the veal alla pizzaiola both write-offs. All the more gratifying, then, to get the costata di manzo, a thuggish-looking hunk of charred rib chop, weighing in at 54 ounces, that turned out to be one of the most flavorful pieces of beef I've sunk a fork into in months, juicy, tender and perfectly cooked.</p>
        <p>''Everything O.K. over here?'' Mr. Pellegrino asked one evening, making his appointed rounds. Four heads nodded yes. This seemed to leave Mr. Pellegrino nonplused. He turned on his heel and said, just audibly, ''Thank God.''</p>
