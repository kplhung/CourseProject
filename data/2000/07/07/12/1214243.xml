        <p>Free performances, discussions and peeks at works in progress are promised by the Off Broadway theater that lays claim to two Broadway hits. It's New York Theater Workshop, where ''Rent'' and 'Dirty Blonde'' originated. On Sunday, New York Theater Workshop will play host at its annual Community Day, an open house of sorts for artists, audiences, members of the community enhanced with free food, entertainment and tours of the theater at 79 East Fourth Street, between Second Avenue and the Bowery.

        <p>Woody Redux</p>
        <p>Yesterday, three days before what would have been his 88th birthday, the folk troubador Woody Guthrie (1912-1967) stepped out of the Dust Bowl of Depression days and into the digital age. The medium is the Buddha Records remastered compact disc of ''Dust Bowl Ballads,'' based on the lives and trials of Southwestern migrant workers. Besides the 15 tracks of the recording originally issued in 1940 by RCA Victor, the new CD includes an alternate version of ''Talkin' Dust Bowl Blues.''</p>
        <p>Rockbound Coast</p>
        <p>For a vision of Maine from its craggy shores  to its virgin forests, one need travel no farther than the Katonah Museum of Art in Westchester. In an exhibition beginning on Sunday, 58 works will explore the myth of Maine as an American Eden and the state's role in the evolution of American art. The 28 artists include George Bellows, Marsden Hartley, Edward Hopper, Alex Katz, John Marin and Fairfield Porter. ''Maine and the Modern Spirit'' continues through Sept. 24.</p>
        <p>Out of India</p>
        <p>''The Indian communities in the New York metropolitan area are huge, but so few non-Indian people have had the opportunity to experience much of our rich culture,'' says Aroon Shivdasani, executive director of the Indo-American Arts Council. As a result, the council is presenting plays by two of India's most celebrated playwrights in its first Festival of Indian Theater, running from Friday to Aug. 2 at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center at 199 Chambers Street. Mahesh Dattani's ''Dance Like a Man,'' the opening attraction, and Vijay Tendulkar's ''Once Upon a Fleeting Bird,'' opening on July 28, will be performed in English.</p>
