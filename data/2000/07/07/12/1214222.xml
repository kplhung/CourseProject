        <p>THE best way to look like an Angeleno is to drive like one. It starts with the car. Rent a convertible, or a sport utility vehicle, the bigger and blacker the better.

        <p>You are eagerly anticipating a trip to one of the world's great cities, but dreading the thought of looking like a tourist. What to do? Just leave those bright plaid Bermuda shorts at home, and follow these tips from Times correspondents.</p>
        <p>THE best way to look like an Angeleno is to drive like one. It starts with the car. Rent a convertible, or a sport utility vehicle, the bigger and blacker the better. (Believe it or not, Budget specializes in some of the spiffiest models.) Rent a cell phone if you're still so out of it you don't have your own.</p>
        <p>If the car is not completely clean, stop at the nearest full-service carwash; for less than $10, you can get a full wash with hand-drying. For a few more bucks, your tires will gleam with the greasy gloss of Armorall. Since, as the song says, ''It never rains in Southern California,'' it's worth the effort to keep your wheels spotless, and most big office buildings feature on-site cleaning service.</p>
        <p>Forget that little map from the rental agency, and skip the fancy on-board computer navigation systems some now offer. Instead, buy a Thomas Guide to Los Angeles at any good gas station or stationery store.</p>
        <p>The guide is not cheap, about $30 depending on the edition, but no self-respecting local would be without a copy of this 1,000-page street atlas in every car. In clear and color-coded detail, it provides a guide to virtually every cranny and cul de sac in Los Angeles and the surrounding county.</p>
        <p>It's de rigueur to say, ''Meet me in Glendale, Thomas Guide page 534, E-4.'' Or to call from the cell phone and ask, ''What's your Thomas Guide page?''</p>
        <p>Even Angelenos use the guide to find almost everything but their closest friends' houses, especially in the vast, unbroken reaches of the Valley (San Fernando, that is).</p>
        <p>Everyone drives in Los Angeles, so the streets and freeways are always full, and driving times are always underestimated. If someone tells you, ''Twenty minutes, tops,'' plan for 40, unless you want to arrive fashionably, and typically, late. Develop a favorite shortcut and brag about it. Sound knowledgeable: ''Oh, I never take the 405 to the airport! Only La Cienega to La Tijera!''</p>
        <p>Finally, don't count on anything as civilized as a left-turn arrow; there aren't many. Just pull as far into the intersection as you can, and when the light turns red, if you're the first or second car in line, barrel ahead. If you're third, you can either risk your life to cross traffic or you can suffer the blaring horn of the driver behind you, who is pegging you as the outlander you are.</p>
