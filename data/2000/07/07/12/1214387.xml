        <p>The first signs of a possible intellectual backlash against the simplicity of the questions on ''Millionaire'' became evident yesterday.</p>
        <p>The History Channel announced at the writers' gathering in Pasadena that it was going to begin its own game show this fall in which contestants would face tough questions about history for modest cash prizes, said to be more than of $30,000.</p>
        <p>The cable channel's executives are billing the new production -- called ''History I.Q.'' and scheduled to begin in October on weeknights at 7:30 -- as ''the thinking man's alternative'' to ''Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>''I think it's fair to say if you can answer a question on 'History I.Q.,' you must be pretty smart in that particular field,'' said the game show's host, Marc Summers. ''I think we're just a little more cerebral than the contestants who may go on 'Millionaire.' ''</p>
