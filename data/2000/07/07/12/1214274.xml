        <p>Martin R. Frankel, who prosecutors contend  masterminded an elaborate insurance fraud from his estate in Greenwich, Conn., might have been shut down as early as a decade ago if Tennessee regulators had done their jobs properly, Tennessee investigators said in a report.</p>
        <p>The state's comptroller of the treasury found that there was a ''gross breakdown'' in regulation of Franklin American Life Insurance, the company that was Mr. Frankel's main insurance entity. It took years to discover what the comptroller's office suggested were flagrant violations of local insurance rules.</p>
        <p>The comptroller's report, released this week, found that the state insurance department did not have the money and expertise needed to oversee Franklin American. The department also had ''an apparent desire to assist the company,'' which had been troubled. Department officials were not accused of malfeasance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frankel fled the United States in May 1999 under pressure from Tennessee and Mississippi regulators. He was captured four months later in Germany, where he is being held and is fighting extradition.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors have accused Mr. Frankel of diverting insurance premiums of companies he controlled to a Swiss bank account and spending some of that money on expensive luxuries, including a four-acre Greenwich home, leased corporate jets, a fleet of cars and a sizable household staff. Mr. Frankel, who used numerous aliases, also hired prominent lawyers and forged an alliance with a senior official at the Vatican in an apparent effort to expand his holdings and shield them from scrutiny.</p>
        <p>Insurance industry experts said that Mr. Frankel's suspected fraud showed how vulnerable the industry is to even moderately sophisticated schemes. Insurance companies are regulated by the states, not the federal government, and the quality of oversight varies widely, they said.</p>
        <p>According to the comptroller's report, Tennessee regulators made their first mistake in 1991 when they failed to scrutinize the named trustees and beneficiaries of a trust Mr. Frankel set up to buy Franklin American despite numerous ''oddities'' in the trust's filings.</p>
        <p>A series of mistakes followed. Regulators allowed Franklin American to turn over its reserves to an unknown, out-of-state securities firm despite state rules that required insurance companies to house their reserves in a local bank.</p>
        <p>Though department regulators suspected that Franklin American's money was being invested riskily, they were slow to investigate. When they did look into the company's investments, they were apparently baffled by fraudulent trading records that showed unusually high returns from an unorthodox investment strategy, the report said.</p>
        <p>When Tennessee hired an outside examiner to look into Franklin American's trading in late 1998, the examiner discovered numerous problems and warned department officials in a memorandum. ''There is a possibility that the company has been looted of its assets,'' the report quotes the memorandum as saying.</p>
        <p>Even then, however, Tennessee officials, after hearing appeals from two prominent Tennessee lawyers hired by Franklin American, gave the company a 60-day grace period to comply with state laws, the report said. The fraud finally unraveled in late April and early May of 1999.</p>
        <p>Tennessee insurance regulators were able to recover some of the money belonging to Franklin American's insurance customers before Mr. Frankel fled.</p>
        <p>Douglas Sizemore, who became Tennessee's insurance commissioner in 1995, resigned in October 1999. He said his resignation was not prompted by the Frankel case.</p>
        <p>The case has resonated among insurance industry officials nationally. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which accredits state regulatory agencies, suspended Tennessee last February. The association has since issued guidelines recommending that members get expert help when examining high-risk investment strategies of insurance companies.</p>
