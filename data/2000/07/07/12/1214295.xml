        <p>Ahmed Hajar carefully unfolded the tattered deed, written in Arabic script, dated 1946, and affixed with a double row of green and purple tax stamps from the British Palestine mandate that described the farm his family owned in what is now Israel.</p>
        <p>He showed the Government of Palestine identity card, No. 3665, that had belonged to his father, Mahmout. His elderly uncle, Muhammad, sitting beside him on a couch in the two rooms where seven people live in this fetid refugee camp, still carries his identity card from the mandate, faded and worn.</p>
        <p>''Then, we had workers on our land,'' the uncle remembered about the farm where they grew oranges, bananas and vegetables near the sea in a village then called Smeirya. ''Now we must work in other people's lands. It is difficult when you have once been an owner.''</p>
        <p>They are among more than three million Palestinian refugees -- 80,000 of them crammed into three-quarters of a square mile of misery in this camp near Sidon -- whose future is one of the issues facing the Camp David summit meeting opening today.</p>
        <p>An estimated 200,000 Palestinian refugees are still in Lebanon. Times are hard for them here, but they sense that they are not on the top of the negotiators' agenda. They are bitter and fearful as they wait for news, worried that they will be left out of any settlement.</p>
        <p>''I must tell you, Arafat only represents himself,'' said Mahmoud Haleilel, a 19-year old student. ''He does not represent us.''</p>
        <p>Twenty-years ago, the refugees here were a swaggering, heavily armed ''state within a state.'' But their presence annoyed many Lebanese, particularly Christians, who feared that they would be -- as the phrase went -- ''implanted'' here, and they became an issue in the bloody 15-year civil war. Now, the refugees are largely confined to their camps and forbidden any but the most menial jobs.</p>
        <p>The 1982 Israeli invasion ended the Palestinian military presence in mostly-Muslim West Beirut and in southern Lebanon. Syria soon ousted  Mr. Arafat's remaining forces around the northern city of Tripoli. Battles between rival factions further weakened the Palestinians. And from May 1985 to April 1987, the Shiite Muslim Amal militia, acting at the behest of Syria, laid siege to the Palestinian areas in the ''Camps War,'' in which more than 1,600 people died.</p>
        <p>The camps today are surrounded by Lebanese troops staffing sandbagged checkpoints in helmets and flak jackets despite the sweltering heat. Though Palestinians traditionally have had a high level of education, regulations issued in 1990 barred them from more than 60 professions, including medicine, law and engineering.</p>
        <p>The camp itself is a warren of cinder block houses, built literally on top of each other, because there is no other room but up. Tiny, dark passageways lead to crowded rooms. Children are everywhere.</p>
        <p>The streets are so narrow that when two cars try to pass, monumental traffic jams result, resolved only by much patient backing and maneuvering. Walls are decorated with faded paintings of the Palestinian flag, revolutionary slogans and old heroes like Che Guevara . Clusters of young men stand about with nothing to do.</p>
        <p>''It is like we are in a jail here,'' said Assef Moussa, 28, launching into a hand-waving string of grievances, in which the word mamnoua -- Arabic for forbidden -- figured repeatedly. Lately, it seemed, the government had stopped construction materials from coming into the camps in order to prevent any further building.</p>
        <p>''I am a physician, but I don't have the right to work here,'' said Dr. Ahmad Ghassem Halabi, who is allowed to practice only at a clinic inside the camp. ''Here we face a very difficult situation, a miserable situation.''</p>
        <p>Most of the families here fled from parts of northern Israel in 1948 and are now into their third generation as refugees. Many left in the widespread panic over news of the massacre in the Arab village of Dier Yassin.</p>
        <p>Some families still have the keys to their old houses, carried with them because they believed the promises of Arab armies that they would be back home in a week. The old people keep alive the memories of more than half century ago. The young make grandiose demands that they return to the old villages.</p>
        <p>''My father gave me this before he died,'' said Ahmed Hajar, a gray-haired man who was born here, smoothing out the torn folds in the old deed. ''He told me also, 'The Jews pushed out the Palestinians.' Really, he said, 'They stole your land. Remember this. Don't forget this. This is your country. Your country is very, very beautiful.' ''</p>
        <p>''What my father taught me, I teach my son,'' he added, putting his arm around his big-eyed 13-year-old son Mahmoud, adding that he, like many Palestinians here, took his children on Sunday into the area of South Lebanon, occupied by Israel until May, so he could look across the border.</p>
        <p>''What is your country?'' he asked gently.</p>
        <p>''Palestine,'' the boy replied.</p>
