      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In its mating dance with several United States and European partners, Deutsche Telekom's eye has turned toward a deal that would involve acquiring both the VoiceStream Wireless Corporation and Qwest Communications International Inc., executives close to Deutsche Telekom said today.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom's newfound attention to VoiceStream and Qwest, however, may also be simply a negotiating ploy to make its other possible partners -- particularly the Sprint Corporation -- jealous.</p>
        <p>Over the last several days, talks between Deutsche Telekom, Germany's largest telephone operator, and VoiceStream, which recently acquired Omnipoint Communications, the mobile telephone operator in New York, have intensified, executives close to the talks said. Deutsche Telekom has informally offered as much as $37 billion for VoiceStream, which has never turned a profit, according to the executives. At the same time, Deutsche Telekom is increasingly leaning toward buying Qwest, which if combined with VoiceStream would give the German conglomerate both a wireless and fixed-line network that would span most of the United States.</p>
        <p>If Deutsche Telekom were to acquire VoiceStream, it would eliminate any possible bid for Sprint, to which it has made informal overtures over the last two weeks, the executives said. Sprint agreed to be acquired by WorldCom Inc. last year, but the companies are expected to announce this week that they will abandon the deal because of opposition from regulators. The unraveling of that transaction makes Sprint attractive to Deutsche Telekom because it has both a nationwide wireless network through Sprint PCS and a fixed-line network. But a deal with VoiceStream and Qwest would effectively replace an acquisition of Sprint, perhaps at a lower cost.</p>
        <p>Analysts said a Deutsche TelekomVoiceStream combination made sense because VoiceStream's network is based on a standard called global system for mobile communications, or G.S.M., which is used in Europe and parts of Asia and would effectively allow the company to offer a seamless worldwide wireless network. The deal would also probably clear regulator hurdles, analysts said.</p>
        <p>Yet it remains unclear whether Deutsche Telekom is primarily interested in VoiceStream as an alternative to Sprint or as a bargaining chip, analysts said.</p>
        <p>''We believe that Deutsche Telekom, through its reported offer for VoiceStream, might be sending a signal to Sprint as it attempts to get Sprint management to take note that there are other candidates for acquisition in the U.S.,'' Frank Marsala, vice president for equity research at ING Barings, said in a report.</p>
        <p>Shares of Sprint fell $4.25 yesterday, to $47.50, while VoiceStream rose $14.125, to $139.0625, and Qwest fell 43.75 cents, to $54. In Frankfurt, shares of Deutsche Telekom fell 2.15 euros, to 59.25 euros, or $56.47.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom has a long history of being left at the altar, analysts said. Its effort to acquire Telecom Italia collapsed last year, and, most recently, it held talks to acquire Qwest. That deal was scuttled by U S West, which was in the midst of its own merger with Qwest. Now that Qwest's deal with U S West has been completed, analysts said it would be much easier to complete a deal with Deutsche Telekom.</p>
        <p>Despite its interest in VoiceStream and Qwest, the company continues to court Sprint along with Cable and Wireless P.L.C. of Britain and, to a lesser extent, Global Crossing Ltd., based in Hamilton, Bermuda, executives close to the company said.</p>
        <p>Other suitors for VoiceStream could also emerge. NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile telephone operator, and France Telecom, which recently acquired Orange P.L.C., Britain's third-largest mobile telephone company, have both looked at VoiceStream, though neither are actively negotiating to buy the company, executives close to those companies said.</p>
        <p>VoiceStream has about 2.3 million customers and licenses across much of the United States. But it remains a start-up company in many respects, with revenue of only $665.7 million and a loss last year of $580 million.</p>
        <p>That means any acquirer will have to plan for continued heavy spending beyond the purchase price to build up the business.</p>
        <p>One person who has looked closely at the company said it was expensive by many measures. At its current market value of $30 billion, he said, the company's value works out to about $15,000 a customer, compared with about $6,000, which France Telecom paid for Orange.</p>
        <p>VoiceStream does own licenses in major metropolitan areas like New York City and Chicago. But it does not have properties in many key areas of the United States, including California.</p>
        <p>If Deutsche Telekom offered as much as $37 billion, it would be paying $175 a share. Though the German telephone giant has amassed a war chest several times that size for acquisitions, the purchase would force it to define its next steps more precisely than it has so far.</p>
        <p>The chairman of Deutsche Telekom, Ron Sommer, has repeatedly said he wants to make big acquisitions and that the United States is a top priority.</p>
        <p>But Telekom executives have been vague about their strategic vision, repeating almost mantra-like that they have targeted ''four pillars'' of future growth: mobile communications; online services; access to the Internet and high-speed data networks; and system services.</p>
        <p>In an intriguing twist, Goldman, Sachs owns 4.5 million shares of VoiceStream and has the right to name one of its 16 board members. Goldman is also advising Deutsche Telekom on its acquisition strategy.</p>
