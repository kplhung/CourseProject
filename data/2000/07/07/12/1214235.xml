        <p>Forno, new Manhattan bakery, makes delicately mellow chocolate mousse cake; photo (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>It would seem to take an act of will for the delicately mellow chocolate mousse at Il Forno, a new bakery at 400 West 50th Street, to hold its shape as a cake. Consisting of little besides excellent rich chocolate mousse, it delivers an irrefutable argument for simplicity. The mousse cake is $3.25 a slice and $29 for a whole cake, which serves 12.</p>
        <p>None of the other items sold in this bakery, which makes the desserts for La Locanda, an Italian restaurant around the corner at 737 Ninth Avenue, are particularly fussy, either. Whipped cream? It comes thickly sandwiched between flaky pastry layers in a napoleon or swiped with chocolate and swirled in a cream puff. Custard? You'll find it slathered as the filling for the pine-nut-strewn torta alla nonna.</p>

        <p>Il Forno also makes breads, focaccias, cookies and tarts. But the elegant chocolate mousse cake is the star.</p>
