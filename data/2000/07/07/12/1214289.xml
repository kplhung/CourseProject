        <p>Years of United Nations efforts to help women in Afghanistan return to work outside their homes have been set back in recent days by the radical Islamic Taliban movement, which controls most of the country, officials said here today.</p>
        <p>Last week, a new edict circulated in Kabul, the capital, saying that Afghan women would no longer be allowed to work with the United Nations or private relief organizations, the only work available to many women who must support families in a country devastated by decades of civil war. The edict was issued by the Ministry of Planning, which followed up its announcement with letters to all aid agencies in the country.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, the Taliban's religious police arrested an American, Mary MacMakin, 71, who had been working with Afghan widows through an organization she founded, the Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Support for Afghanistan. Seven Afghan women working for her also were arrested and Ms. MacMakin, who has lived in Afghanistan off and on for more than 30 years, refused a Taliban offer to go free and leave her colleagues in their custody.</p>
        <p>The Taliban, who had taken control of most of the country by 1996, have generally opposed women working outside the home. Over the last year, however, women began to return to jobs in health, education and food services.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials in the region said that the edict and subsequent arrests have frightened many Afghan women, who are staying away from work they need rather than risk arrest by the religious police.</p>
        <p>Today, the United States, which has no diplomatic relations with the Taliban, called for Ms. MacMakin's release in a statement from the American Embassy in Islamabad, the capital of neighboring Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Ms. MacMakin had in the past been critical of the American boycott of the Taliban. During a recent visit to the United States to raise money for her charity, she said the isolation imposed on Afghanistan by the Clinton administration, alone and through Security Council sanctions, was hurting the poorest Afghans.</p>
        <p>The Taliban have never been permitted to take Afghanistan's United Nations seat, which is still held by an opposition alliance operating from outside the country.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the United Nations coordinator for Afghanistan, Erick de Mul, is expected to go to Kandahar, the Taliban's spiritual capital, to talk with Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil about the edict. Mr. de Mul has spent months negotiating with the Taliban for small advances in women's rights, and United Nations agencies have made the hiring of women mandatory if the Taliban want to continue receiving aid.</p>
        <p>In a statement today, the United Nations said that without the women, many programs in Afghanistan would be severely affected.</p>
