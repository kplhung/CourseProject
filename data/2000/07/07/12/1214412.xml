        <p>My otherwise upstanding husband used to get sick the first day of every vacation. Now we have children: he can't get sick, so he doesn't. But in the olden days, he used to push and push work-wise, then take his temperature on the plane.</p>
        <p>''You cannot be sick!'' I told him once. ''You haven't missed one day of work in five years. Why do you have to wait until we're on our way to Rome?''</p>

        <p>My otherwise upstanding husband used to get sick the first day of every vacation. Now we have children: he can't get sick, so he doesn't. But in the olden days, he used to push and push work-wise, then take his temperature on the plane.</p>
        <p>''You cannot be sick!'' I told him once. ''You haven't missed one day of work in five years. Why do you have to wait until we're on our way to Rome?''</p>
        <p>He calmly squinted at the digital readout; ''101,'' he replied with not-so-secret satisfaction, and: ''Didn't you once do a paper on Florence Nightingale?''</p>
        <p>''No,'' I said.</p>
        <p>''Do you remember how she never once told anyone they couldn't be sick?''</p>
        <p>''No.''</p>
        <p>''Well, she didn't.''</p>
        <p>''How do you know?'' I said. ''You never did a paper on Florence Nightingale. Whereas I did, actually.''</p>
        <p>There was an undulant pause here, such as explained our marriage.</p>
        <p>''It was your first research paper, in fifth grade,'' he supplied sweetly -- adding, ''I think there is some Tylenol in the backpack.''</p>
        <p>At last, at last, I realized that I could fall ill, too. Not with a stomach bug; stomach bugs are an affliction of no recreational value. However, to fall ill with something that renders you hammock-bound while other people concern themselves with your hydration is something else. To be ill is to be still and sentient; it is to be on vacation from yourself. You put down your guidebooks. You leave off making boring literary references. People enter your life, emanating interesting expertise.</p>
        <p>I once ran a fever in the Caribbean (after my husband was done with his), and the impressions are still with me: the tough love of the hammock rope; the salt, close air; the sea-sensitive sky; the sex-crazed flowers. I knew every palm tree in the grove in which I hung -- which way they curved (which was every whichway); whether they had coconuts or not, and how many. They were my ward; they were my wards.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I folded my hands across my chest. Sometimes I let them dangle, stretching my shoulder sockets. There was a double rainbow every day, waxing, waning, signifying nothing. Brilliant-colored birds braved my vicinity while my husband went water-skiing. He jumped waves like a man half his age, not like someone who ought to and probably would have his anterior cruciate ligaments repaired if only he could schedule the rehab.</p>
        <p>Soon I would be snorkeling.</p>
        <p>My husband's vision has always been better than mine, but when I rose from my hammock, I was the one who saw everything: a moray eel in the reef, a ray with a flipper span of some five feet, a baby angel shark in the shallows. Hundreds of birds. I vowed to fall ill every vacation.</p>
        <p>However, we have since had children. My job at the beach, besides making sure no one drowns, burns, chokes or is avoidably bitten, is supplies -- food, drink, shovels, pails, boogie boards, swim rings, Frisbees. Umbrellas, towels, chairs. Every now and then I look up at the sky, and there it is: healthy.</p>
