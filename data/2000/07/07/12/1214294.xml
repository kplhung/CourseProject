        <p>GEORGE STEINBRENNER, who is to baseball what Matthew Brady, Edward Steichen and Richard Avedon are to photography, is an expert on focus.</p>
        <p>This is what the Yankees' principal owner said Monday in regard to the Mets' charge after their weekend series that Roger Clemens purposely hit Mike Piazza in the head with a 92-mile-an-hour fastball, and, to a markedly lesser degree, the protested interference call against Met first baseman Todd Zeile.</p>
        <p>''They had to take the focus off the fact that they got their fannies handed to them this time,'' Steinbrenner said. ''I'm not sure it wasn't a very wise public relations move for them to take the focus off the way they were beaten.</p>
        <p>''I think Bobby Valentine and his people would love to take the focus off that, and have the people forget about the results.''</p>
        <p>What Steinbrenner -- we can just picture him under a black cloth and behind that old boxy camera -- is really doing is seeking to return the focus to where he believes the focus has suddenly become unfocused. That is, on his Bronx Bombers. But his defense of his pitcher, while understandable, is tasteless, if not reprehensible.</p>
        <p>It is undeniable, of course, that the Yankees beat the Mets three out of four games last weekend, and four out of six in the Subway Series this year. And forget for a moment that an opposing player could very well have been killed, or severely maimed for life by a pitcher whose salary Steinbrenner pays, but recall his expertise on focus. Examples are long, and legendary:</p>
        <p>''I didn't fire the man'': Steinbrenner, at a news conference announcing the departure of his manager Dick Howser in 1980. Then in 1987: ''Firing Dick Howser and not re-signing Reggie Jackson were the two biggest mistakes I ever made with the Yankees.'' And there was his defense of himself with his fists in 1981 when attacked by an elevator in Los Angeles after the Yanks were beaten in the World Series by the Dodgers. And every time the Yanks make a stupid trade: ''It was my baseball people.'' And whenever they make a successful move -- well, you get the picture.</p>
        <p>Now, Steinbrenner may bridle at these observations, saying that that stuff is old hat, but here we are with a new hat that looks very much like the old fedora.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner may very well be a flyspeck this side of objective in his viewpoint. And it says here that the umpire's call, which awarded Chuck Knoblauch second base after initially being thrown out when he was forced to run around Zeile, was the correct one. Either Zeile, dreamily spectating directly in the base path, was canny and knew better, or he's a dolt and didn't. Either way, the Mets' protest of the game to the league office should be dismissed.</p>
        <p>The Clemens pitch, which produced a concussion in Piazza despite his wearing a plastic helmet for protection, is another matter. It's a well-worn axiom, as Steinbrenner adds, that fastball pitchers ''have to live on the inside.'' And brushbacks are a century-old part of baseball. But that doesn't make it right. Steinbrenner said: ''I know Roger, I know he's a family guy who loves his kids, and there's no way a future Hall of Famer like him is going to try to hurt somebody.''</p>
        <p>Maybe not. But Clemens is famous for hitting people, and is a virtuoso at ''chin music.'' I remember talking to Seattle players a few years ago who said that Clemens hits every Mariner rookie the first time he sees him -- ''to send a message.'' A message that can be perilous.</p>
        <p>I will never forget Tony Conigliaro of the Red Sox being hit in the face in 1967 with a fastball thrown by Jack Hamilton, who had a reputation like Clemens's. Conigliaro was a 22-year-old slugger, and on his way to a wonderful career. People at the game recall with horror the sound of Hamilton's fastball cracking into his face, like the smashing of a melon.</p>
        <p>Tony C. was out for the remainder of that season, and the entire 1968 season. He returned to the game, but his eyesight was impaired, his head forever different from before. He retired in 1975, suffered a heart attack in 1982 and died in 1990 at age 45.</p>
        <p>And Clemens's message to Piazza, on a night when his control was superb: You must pay for going 7 for 12 against me lifetime, with 3 homers.</p>
        <p>Pitching inside is one thing. Head-hunting is another. Baseball should no longer tolerate that murderous tradition. And George Steinbrenner, sometimes, yes, a leader in positive ways in baseball, could have judiciously led here, too. But his focus in this grave case was not only self-serving, it was shamelessly distorted.</p>
