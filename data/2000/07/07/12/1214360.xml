        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Brent Staples accurately states that the SAT may be only ''one element among many in predicting college performance'' (''The Coming Backlash Against 'the Big Test,' '' Editorial Observer, July 10). But by dismissing the SAT as ''a test of mental dexterity'' and ''a tool for class segregation,'' critics of the SAT miss the point.</p>
        <p>We are confronted with a generation of students whose vocabulary is severely limited. I found that in my 35-year career as an advanced placement English teacher, the high SAT scores were usually achieved by the readers.</p>
        <p>Vocabulary has always been an index of one's intelligence. Language and thought are inextricably related. There is no avenue of study that does not depend on the ability to reason, draw inferences and make judgments. On the SAT, vocabulary is the chief basis for that evaluation.</p>
        <p>Technology has had a damaging effect on adolescents. Reading has become a strenuous exercise, and since movies, television and Monarch Notes require little effort, they have become appealing substitutes.</p>
