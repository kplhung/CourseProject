        <p>CHUCK MAIDA has always loved to travel.

        <p>CHUCK MAIDA has always loved to travel. But years ago, when he was working as an accountant, each vacation ended with the awful realization that he had to go back to work, which literally made him sick. ''My stomach would get into knots,'' Mr. Maida said. ''I used to throw up when I got back. It was horrible. That's when I realized I was doing the wrong thing.'' Eventually, Mr. Maida quit his accounting job and started his own company, All Seasons Travel, in Jacksonville, Fla.</p>
        <p>It is not unusual to have a strong, even visceral, reaction to what experts call ''re-entry'' -- the return to work after a vacation. A vacation, of course, is supposed to alleviate job stress and allow a worker to come back refreshed and energized. But the sad truth is that the transition from doing exactly what you want to doing others' bidding often obliterates any positive effects.</p>
        <p>Deborah Maclean, who is now an actress in Glen Ridge, N.J., went to France on her honeymoon 11 years ago, and returned to a new job teaching Russian at Columbia University. ''We got back all 'ooh-la-la,' '' she said. ''That lasted the rest of the afternoon.'' Once she started work, she said, ''I just remember feeling like I got slapped in the face.''</p>
        <p>Dov Eden, a professor of management at Tel Aviv University in Israel, is one of just a handful of academic experts worldwide who studies what he calls the ''temporary decline in burnout'' that vacations afford. Dr. Eden and a colleague quantified this ''respite effect'' by administering a questionnaire to 76 clerical workers before, during and after vacations.</p>
        <p>THE study found the respite to be short-lived. Within three days, exactly half of the benefit was gone and, after three weeks, it was all gone. ''They're back to their pre-vacation levels'' of stress, Dr. Eden said. ''It's as if they've never gone away.''</p>
        <p>Even Dr. Eden, who likes his job and admits to being ''spoiled silly'' by an academic life that allows him to do work mostly at home, has sadly observed his own vacation afterglows dissipate with depressing rapidity. ''It wears off,'' he said. ''It depends on how fast and heavy the events come. One critical day at the office can wipe it out.''</p>
        <p>One reason that workplace re-entry can be so hard is that everything  piles up in your absence. Michael S. Pingrey, the general manager of ACT Travel in Washington, says that the first thing he does after a trip is to go through his in-basket and throw away about half the papers. ''That feels good,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even so, some unpleasant surprise is bound to be lurking in the pile; in Mr. Pingrey's case, it was finding second notices for overdue bills upon his return from a spring scuba-diving vacation. ''Even the little emergencies are overwhelming when you get back,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The stress of returning to work is not just psychological. Those late notices are likely to raise one's blood pressure. James Campbell Quick, a professor of organizational behavior at the University of Texas at Arlington, notes that the incidence of heart attacks rises on Monday mornings, when most people are back from merely a two-day respite. ''You get a more pronounced effect from a longer vacation,'' he said. Reactions can include increased heart rate, muscle tension and disturbed sleep.</p>
        <p>The explanation is simple. The very act of focusing -- something everybody needs to do at work --  releases the chemical agents adrenaline and norepinephrine. ''They're like the on-and-off switch,'' Dr. Quick said. ''It's an upper. It turns you on. It gets us focused.''</p>
        <p>Leslie Norton, a columnist for Barron's, spent a week this spring walking in the lake region of England. ''It was a wonderful vacation,'' she recalled dreamily. But walking around lakes and looking at cows is the opposite of what she does for a living. ''My job requires a tremendous amount of focus,'' she said. ''Endless telephone calls and, frequently, sharp questioning.'' The act of refocusing not only took Ms. Norton out of her post-vacation reverie; her post-vacation reverie also softened her focus and made her feel temporarily mushy and inadequate in her job.</p>
        <p>BUT Ms. Norton is lucky. At least she enjoyed her vacation. Dr. Peter A. Wish, a stress-management consultant in Longboat Key, Fla., says that the re-entry problem is worse for people who have had disappointing vacations. ''If they expected a beach vacation and it rained every day, then their stress level will be much higher,'' he said. ''Most people just can't go with the flow.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Wish suggested that people plan their re-entry to work as carefully as they plan their vacations. Try to realize, he said, that the refrigerator will be empty, so go out to dinner the first night back. Or schedule some post-vacation pampering -- a massage or a manicure, perhaps, or a night out with friends.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Maclean, the antidote for post-vacation-stress syndrome was cheap and simple. Her honeymoon in France couldn't last forever. But she could read Peter Mayle books on the way to work.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the best book to read after a vacation would be ''Into Thin Air,'' Jon Krakauer's account of the 1996 Mount Everest expedition in which nine climbers died. There is nothing like an adventure-travel disaster to make life behind a desk look sweet again.</p>
