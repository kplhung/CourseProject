        <p>You are eagerly anticipating a trip to one of the world's great cities, but dreading the thought of looking like a tourist. What to do? Just leave those bright plaid Bermuda shorts at home, and follow these tips from Times correspondents.</p>
        <p>FOR a Western visitor, blending in with the natives in Hong Kong is probably a lost cause, unless one happens to be of Chinese descent. But as a former British colony that draws more than 10 million tourists a year, Hong Kong regards out-of-towners as part of the landscape. It is also a city of immigrants from mainland China, so ''passing through'' is a perfectly respectable status.</p>

        <p>You are eagerly anticipating a trip to one of the world's great cities, but dreading the thought of looking like a tourist. What to do? Just leave those bright plaid Bermuda shorts at home, and follow these tips from Times correspondents.</p>
        <p>FOR a Western visitor, blending in with the natives in Hong Kong is probably a lost cause, unless one happens to be of Chinese descent. But as a former British colony that draws more than 10 million tourists a year, Hong Kong regards out-of-towners as part of the landscape. It is also a city of immigrants from mainland China, so ''passing through'' is a perfectly respectable status.</p>
        <p>Still, there are ways that visitors can avoid looking hopelessly transitory. For starters, avoid staying in Tsim Sha Tsui, the tourist ghetto at  the tip of Kowloon. It is home to more tacky shops, bars, strip clubs, and electronics stores per block than almost any neighborhood in the world.  It is not home to many Hong Kongers -- at least not on a Saturday in July.</p>
        <p>If you do stay in Kowloon, take the Star Ferry when crossing the harbor to Hong Kong Island. Despite their too-cute appearance, these green-and-white vessels are a genuine local institution. They ply the choppy waters from 6:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., and a one-way ticket costs 25 cents.</p>
        <p>When you step off the ferry, head for City Hall, which is a dim sum  restaurant, not a government seat. The dining room echoes with the clanking of trolley carts bearing treats like steamed dumplings. No  problem if you don't speak Cantonese; just point (011-852-2521-1303).</p>
        <p>Hong Kong's night life has heated up since the Asian economic crisis  ended. But the locus of activity has shifted from Wanchai, immortalized in the film ''The World of Suzie Wong,'' to SoHo, a neighborhood in the hills above the Central district. Just south of Hollywood Road (hence the SoHo name), the narrow streets are packed with trendy bars and restaurants.</p>
        <p>Drop in at the cozy Petticoat Lane for a drink, and follow it up with dinner at M at the Fringe, a romantic and inventive restaurant on the second floor of a converted icehouse (2 Lower Albert Road, 011-852-2877-4000). A three-course dinner for two, without drinks, will cost about $120.</p>
        <p>Such hip places aside, Hong Kong has retained a certain British starchiness. Few locals wear shorts or T-shirts, even on weekends. If you want  to avoid looking out of place, consider wearing khakis and a polo shirt while sightseeing. Tennis shoes and fanny packs are not frowned on -- just considered outre.</p>
