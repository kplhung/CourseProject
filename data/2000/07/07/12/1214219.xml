        <p>You are eagerly anticipating a trip to one of the world's great cities, but dreading the thought of looking like a tourist. What to do? Just leave those bright plaid Bermuda shorts at home, and follow these tips from Times correspondents.</p>
        <p>ITALIANS are far less viscerally anti-American than their French or English counterparts, and cheerfully accept tourists and their follies, even those who consider unflattering shorts and running shoes appropriate streetwear.</p>
        <p>But there are limits to Mediterranean laissez-faire. The dividing line, of course, is food. The most frequent, and offensive, request made by American tourists is for a cappuccino after lunch or dinner. Italians consider it a breakfast drink. And while some touristy restaurants have given in, others have not.</p>
        <p>When a New York visitor recently requested a cappuccino after lunch  at Da Enzo, a tiny neighborhood restaurant in Trastevere, the owner stalked over to the ''Cucina Romana'' sign on the door, traced the letters and hollered, in Italian, ''That means NO cappuccino.''</p>
        <p>Tourists accustomed to Starbucks should also be prepared for incredulous stares when they order a ''latte.'' It just means milk in Italian,  and it is not considered an adult beverage. (Ask for a ''latte macchiato.'') Americans often drink coffee with their meal. Italians view that as barbaric and order their espresso only after dessert.</p>
        <p>Even after-dinner drinks carry  peril. Some Americans think it is chic to put a liqueur like sambuca or grappa in their coffee. It isn't.</p>
        <p>Italians love wine bars, which serve salads, cheeses and a few hot dishes for lunch and sometimes dinner. Bottega del Vino on Santa Maria del Pianto in the Ghetto, and Trimani on Via Cernaia, near the train station, are two of the best in Rome. But only Americans ask for butter with their bread. Or Parmigiano cheese on a fish-pasta dish.</p>
        <p>Ordering salad as an appetizer is considered gauche. In some places, even asking for balsamic vinegar on a salad raises eyebrows. A food fad in the United States and some Italian restaurants, aceto balsamico is still a cooking condiment for Italian purists, used sparingly to flavor meat, lentils and even strawberries.</p>
        <p>The American custom of tipping generously after a meal is also very  un-Italian, but it is one habit that rarely offends.</p>
