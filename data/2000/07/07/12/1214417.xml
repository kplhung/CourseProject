        <p>EACH of these books is a great favorite of mine, and each rewards deep, leisurely attention of the summer-vacation variety. The last two are hard to find but worth the trouble.</p>
        <p>''A Time to Be Born,'' by Dawn Powell. In this heavenly, sharp-clawed 1942 evocation of ambitious New Yorkers on the eve of World War II, Powell had endless fun with a beautiful, calculating and conspicuously well-married heroine. This hilariously self-promoting character, as the author pointed out, had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Clare Boothe Luce. And Powell's most delightful comedy of manners works even better as archly sophisticated satire. Anyone new to Powell's work should start with this one. Tim Page's ''Dawn Powell: A Biography'' (1998) is an invaluable companion piece.</p>

In this heavenly, sharp-clawed 1942 evocation of ambitious New Yorkers on the eve of World War II, Powell had endless fun with a beautiful, calculating and conspicuously well-married heroine.

Tim Page's ''Dawn Powell: A Biography'' (1998) is an invaluable companion piece.</p>
        <p>''The Custom of the Country,'' by  Edith Wharton. More proof that a sharp eye for social foibles never goes out of style. Wharton's 1913 chronicle of the fast-rising Undine Spragg follows its gilded characters through New York and Europe as the willful Undine learns that it's lonely at the top.</p>
        <p>''Common Ground: A Turbulent Decade in the Lives of Three American Families,'' by J. Anthony Lukas. Exemplary, compassionate reporting about racial tensions in the Boston area creates a fascinating sociopolitical microcosm, making this 1986 book an intimate, deeply enveloping look at American life.</p>
        <p>''Olympia: Paris in the Age of Manet,'' by Otto Friedrich. The author of ''City of Nets,'' a dazzling, intricate look at European emigres in 1940's Hollywood, was also in splendid form as he analyzed 19th-century Paris in this 1992 book. Using Manet's controversial masterpiece as his starting point, Friedrich examined every imaginable aspect of the city's history and culture in a book that bristles with incisive analysis and amazing data.</p>
        <p>''The Finishing Stroke,'' by Ellery Queen. The best and trickiest mystery I have ever read, featuring my favorite detective. Ellery, known for his pince-nez, Duesenberg and fancy ratiocinations, is called into action once the holiday house party that he attends turns out to have a mysterious feature: a guest leaving cryptic poems and unexplained gifts on each of the 12 nights of Christmas. Very much in the tradition of Agatha Christie's ''And Then There Were None,'' this 1958 book has a denouement to blow the mind.</p>
