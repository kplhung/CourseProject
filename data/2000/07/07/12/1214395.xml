        <p>When Katy Feeney of Major League Baseball contacted Joe Girardi on Monday afternoon and asked him if he could get to tonight's All-Star Game for the National League, Girardi was puzzled.</p>
        <p>''My first question was, 'Do you want me as a player?' '' he recalled.</p>
        <p>Feeney assured Girardi that he was wanted as a backup catcher, and it took Girardi about three seconds to say, ''I'll be right there.''</p>
        <p>The call came at 2:30 p.m., and Girardi and his wife, Kim, quickly packed, had the Chicago Cubs deliver his glove, his cleats, his uniform and his catcher's equipment to O'Hare Airport, and then left with their 1-year old daughter, Serena, on a 5:10 flight.</p>
        <p>For the first time in his 12-year major league career, Girardi was named to the All-Star team. It did not matter to Girardi that he was selected only after Mike Piazza could not play because of a concussion and then after Javier Lopez and Todd Hundley were both unavailable. All that mattered to Girardi, the former Yankee, was that he was at Turner Field and he was finally an All-Star.</p>
        <p>''In 50 years, no one is going to remember that,'' Girardi said about being the fourth pick. ''My daughter's not going to know the difference either.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for him, Girardi was the only position player not to get into the game.</p>
        <p>Girardi, who is hitting .302 with 4 homers and 21 runs batted in this season, said that he had essentially given up hope that he would ever make the All-Star team. He is 35 and will probably retire after 2002.</p>
        <p>''I stopped worrying about it,'' Girardi said. ''There were a couple of years I was close and came up short, deservedly so. But this is a total shock.''</p>
        <p>Girardi's presence provided a neat story, because he was reunited with Jorge Posada, his protege with the Yankees for the last four years and another first-time All-Star.</p>
        <p>''It means a lot, especially for him,'' Posada said. ''He went to another place to try and win and play every day and he ends up at the All-Star Game.''</p>
