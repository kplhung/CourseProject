        <p>You are eagerly anticipating a trip to one of the world's great cities, but dreading the thought of looking like a tourist. What to do? Just leave those bright plaid Bermuda shorts at home, and follow these tips from Times correspondents.</p>
        <p>HERE'S how to spot a tourist on the beaches of Rio: while the local folks, known as Cariocas, wear virtually nothing as they amble down the promenade, the typical foreign visitor is decked out in a uniform of Bermuda shorts, sandals and straw hat, striding with all the speed and determination of a freight train leaving the station.</p>
        <p>Granted, there is little that can be done about the pale skin that also sets off many outsiders. But blending in with Rio's beachgoers is more a question of attitude than anything else. So tip No. 1 is not to feel shy about shedding some clothes and a few inhibitions. Cariocas are used to seeing bodies exposed, even those that are wrinkled, chunky or sagging in a few places, and in the heat of the tropics, it is always better to go about undraped than sweaty.</p>
        <p>If you hope to fit in, it is also advisable to make some adjustments from standard American mealtimes. Anyone going to dinner in Rio at 7 is going to be eating alone, assuming that the restaurant has even opened its doors at that hour. Most of the best dining spots don't start filling up until about 10 and are still going strong at midnight. Since this is Rio, the byword is informality, which means men do not need to wear a tie.</p>
        <p>Rio is synonymous with the samba, but most Cariocas would scoff at the shows catering to tourists in night spots like Plataforma, which stress exotic stereotypes at the expense of authenticity and swing. For a dose of real Brazilian popular music, try music halls like Canecao, Metropolitan or Olympia, which feature the top artists of genres from classic bossa nova to newer styles like pagode and axe.</p>
        <p>Keeping track of all the goings-on can be difficult, since there is a surprising scarcity of information available in English. For those with some knowledge of Portuguese, though, the Caderno B, or daily culture section of each of the city's two main newspapers, O Globo and Jornal do Brasil, offers complete listings of concerts, galleries, plays and other events. Even more thorough is a new Web site, www.veja-rio.com.br, introduced by Veja, the country's leading newsmagazine.</p>
