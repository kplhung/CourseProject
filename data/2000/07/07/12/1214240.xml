        <p>COOKING onions very slowly brings out amazing flavor, a rich sweetness. Just by themselves they taste great, but when you combine them with the liquid exuded by olives and tomatoes, you get a gloriously juicy base for any fish fillet or steak. With meaty grilled tuna or swordfish, the onions make an easy summer dish with a Provencal accent.</p>
        <p>Onions cooked this way can be considered a confit, a term that has been adapted to apply to almost any food that is slow-cooked to achieve the ultimate in tenderness. A confit often involves lots of fat, but onions give off so much liquid you need very little, just a few tablespoons of olive oil. They essentially stew in their own juices. The only considerations are a low flame and a fair amount of time, about 30 to 40 minutes. The onions should not brown at all.</p>

        <p>COOKING onions very slowly brings out amazing flavor, a rich sweetness.

With meaty grilled tuna or swordfish, the onions make an easy summer dish with a Provencal accent.</p>
        <p>Onions cooked this way can be considered a confit, a term that has been adapted to apply to almost any food that is slow-cooked to achieve the ultimate in tenderness. A confit often involves lots of fat, but onions give off so much liquid you need very little, just a few tablespoons of olive oil. They essentially stew in their own juices. The only considerations are a low flame and a fair amount of time, about 30 to 40 minutes. The onions should not brown at all.</p>
        <p>While the onions are cooking, you can finish the rest of the dish. As the grill is heating for the fish, pit and chop the olives and dice the tomatoes. I don't bother to skin them; just core them and shake out most of their seeds before chopping them. Grilling the fish takes just six minutes if you use tuna, closer to 10 minutes if you choose to overlook the current boycott (based on possible overfishing) and use swordfish. The fish can be cooked as individual steaks or in one slab, then cut into serving portions.</p>
        <p>Thyme is the perfect herb for the onions, but you can use bay leaf instead, or you can finish the dish with a handful of chopped basil, chervil or parsley. If you like, you can also cook some finely chopped aromatic vegetables, like carrots, celery, fennel and garlic, along with the onions.</p>
        <p>The fish is very straightforward: just seasoned and grilled. Although I like this dish best with tuna or swordfish, it's almost as good with grilled boneless chicken breasts, as long as they're not overcooked.</p>
        <p>TUNA OR SWORDFISH WITH ONION CONFIT  Time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  3 large or 4 or 5 medium onions, peeled and thinly sliced  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 large thyme sprig or 1 bay leaf  2 medium tomatoes, cored  1 1/2 to 2 pounds tuna or swordfish, cut into steaks or left whole  About  1/2 cup pitted and roughly chopped black olives.</p>
        <p>1. Put olive oil in a 10- or 12-inch skillet, and turn heat to medium. Add onions, a good pinch of salt, pepper and thyme or bay leaf. Cook, stirring, until mixture starts to sizzle, a minute or two. Adjust heat so that you need to stir at most every 5 minutes to keep onions from browning as they soften. Cook at least 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, cut tomatoes in half and shake out seeds, then cut into  1/2-inch dice. Heat a grill until moderately hot.</p>
        <p>3. When onions are very soft, almost a shapeless mass, season fish and grill, turning once, for a total of about 6 minutes for tuna, 8 to 10 minutes for swordfish; check for doneness by making a small cut in the center to peek inside. While fish is grilling, stir olives and tomatoes into onions, and raise heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes liquefy and mixture becomes juicy. Taste, and adjust seasoning. Serve fish on a bed of onion confit, whole fish cut into serving portions.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
