        <p>They've been living here as long as anyone else, and you have to hand it to them, they're really good at making the city work for them. They'll raise a family of 20 or 30 in a space you'd be embarrassed to call a broom closet. They like a nice well-balanced meal as much as anyone, but if they can't even get a slice of pizza -- and they love pizza -- they'll settle for some ants. And they sleep right through the noise.</p>
        <p>Being a rat, however, does have certain drawbacks in New York. Not too many humans will take your side. And now the mayor has made it clear: he truly hates rats.</p>
        <p>Appalled that rats have had the temerity to wander across the porch of Gracie Mansion in his presence, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced the formation of a city task force the other day to determine how to reduce the city's rat population already.</p>
        <p>Good luck.</p>
        <p>Rats genuinely like New York, and the New York rat has adapted itself quite nicely to the vagaries of New York life. Don't bet on its just packing up and going to Jersey City.</p>
        <p>No one knows how many rats live in the city. Some citizens have lamented that there have to be at least eight or nine rats per person. A more common conclusion is one rat per human. City health officials say these are all guesses. ''We don't do rat tail counts,'' a Health Department spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>There are actually hundreds of different species of rats, but most are wild rats that don't do well in any city, let alone New York. They don't care for city food, and they can't deal with the noise.</p>
        <p>The prevalent species found in New York is the Rattus norvegicus, or the Norway or brown rat. It's not actually strictly from Norway, but comes from northern Europe. Now and then, you'll see some Rattus rattus, the black rat, which arrives here on ships from Asia.</p>
        <p>Daniel Wharton, a biologist and director of the Central Park Zoo, is acutely familiar with the lifestyle of the rat and was good enough to give a rundown on the Norway.</p>
        <p>''They're what we call a commensal rodent,'' he said. ''They live off of another species, which happens to be us. They've learned to exploit us tremendously and use our habitat and resources for themselves. When our numbers go up, their numbers go up.''</p>
        <p>The Norway rat weighs upward of a pound and, counting the tail, is typically about a foot long. Some well-fed ones with weight-control issues sometimes get bigger, but nothing like the giant pouched rat of Africa, which is the size of a Yorkshire terrier.</p>
        <p>Rats are capable of carrying highly contagious diseases like typhus and bubonic plague, but city health officials say the rat population is more of a nuisance than a health threat.</p>
        <p>A lab rat often lives to be 3 or 4 years old, but a street rat is a senior citizen if it makes it to 3. Most New York rats expire in about a year. But they leave plenty of descendants. They're sexually mature in 8 to 12 weeks and can produce a litter of five to seven babies every couple of months.</p>
        <p>The Norway rats live in clans that typically comprise a male, five or six females and their offspring. Each clan will stake out a territory of a few thousand square feet and will fight off outsiders, especially when food gets scarce.</p>
        <p>They'll live anywhere, in cracks in buildings, in sidewalk planters. They are attracted to areas with plentiful food like restaurants and lots that are erratically cleaned, and there are Park Avenue rats just as there are East New York rats. The greater use of garbage bags rather than garbage cans has contributed to the spread of rats. Noise doesn't necessarily faze the Norway rat. City rats will live inside heavy machinery -- while it's running.</p>
        <p>They like to eat well, if they can. According to Dr. Wharton, ''They're really interested in creating a balanced meal.'' Steak or chicken would be sensible first choices, and they're pizza fans. They'll take tofu. They'll take moo shu pork. They like sweets, and will lap up coffee with sugar in it. They'll drink Coke. They'll drink beer or wine. Will they get drunk? ''Probably,'' is Dr. Wharton's guess.</p>
        <p>The resourceful thing about rats is that while they will eat everything that humans will, they will also eat things that humans won't. They won't eat rancid food, because it makes them sick and they are incapable of regurgitating. But they'll dine on vegetable matter from trees. They'll eat seeds. They'll eat insects. They'll eat animal droppings. Perhaps the one wonderful thing you can say for rats: They'll eat roaches.</p>
        <p>Their memories are developed enough, Dr. Wharton said, that they will repeatedly return to trash containers that regularly contain food and will remember to ignore cans that rarely yield anything beyond paper and glass.</p>
        <p>A number of tactics are used to combat rats, but the rats are formidable opponents. Among other things, exterminators focus on building them out by covering openings with sheet metal and doors with weatherstripping. But rats are remarkably supple. Their skulls are not plated together like those of a lot of mammals, so a rat can change the shape of its head and body and squeeze through an opening as small as a nickel.</p>
        <p>Various traps are employed -- cage traps, snap traps, glue traps -- as well as a variety of poisons. But rats are shrewd. ''They seem to know when to be wary when people leave things to catch them,'' Dr. Wharton said.</p>
        <p>Gil Bloom, vice president of Standard Exterminating, a Long Island City company that has been fighting rats and other interlopers for 70 years, said he had not only seen rats learn to stay away from traps, but he had also seen rats scurry through a building and avoid an area where a trap had once been, though it was no longer there. He said rats had been caught in glue traps and gnawed off a foot to escape.</p>
        <p>Apart from the fact that rats make people squeamish, they can be highly destructive. They are known to gnaw through the seats of tractors and bulldozers in pursuit of the salt in the sweat of the operators who had been sitting on them. They'll chew through a car seat to get at popcorn dropped behind the cushions. Lost dimes and quarters, they don't care about.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, the city raised the rat control budget to about $13 million, from $5.5 million. Among other things, the city's pest control people began studying complaints to identify clusters where rat infestation was heaviest and then to home in on those clusters, much in the way that the police fight non-rodent crime.</p>
        <p>Even though he wants some more gone, Mayor Giuliani, in announcing his task force, claimed that the city had killed more rats in the last three years than at any other time in the city's history. He gave no body counts, and the Health Department said it had no way of comparing mortality rates.</p>
        <p>James Gibson, the City Health Department's assistant commissioner for veterinary and pest control services, said there were some indicators that the city was making progress against rats. Rat complaints are down, though that could be because of fatigue about complaining. Rat bites, he said, dropped to 157 in the last year, when they have tended to range between 170 and 210.</p>
        <p>Rats, though, are no competition against humans when it comes to biting. There were about 1,100 human bites last year.</p>
        <p>Exterminators like Mr. Bloom believe that the rat problem is worse than at any other time since they've been in the business. Mr. Bloom said he gets two or three new rat accounts a week, on top of innumerable phone calls with rat questions.</p>
        <p>For her part, C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, said yesterday that the city's response to the rat situation was inadequate, and she introduced a toll-free complaint line: 1-800-RAT-1550 (1-800-728-1550).</p>
        <p>But no one envisions a rat-free city. ''Rats are survivors,'' Mr. Bloom said. ''And rats are apolitical. They don't care about boundaries. They don't care about politics.''</p>
