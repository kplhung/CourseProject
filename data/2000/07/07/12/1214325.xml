        <p>The sprawling 27-building plant in Astoria, Queens, dates back to just after the Civil War, and its cumbersome products are still built largely by hand.</p>
        <p>Most other manufacturers of that era have long since gone out of business or fled the city, but not Steinway &amp; Sons, a local institution that gave its name to Astoria's main street. And even as other old industrial buildings are being rehabilitated for Internet uses, Steinway is finishing a $5 million expansion and renovation of quite a different sort.</p>
        <p>The company's 11-acre complex in Queens is one of two places in the world where it still makes what are arguably the world's most esteemed pianos, about a dozen a day, the same rate as a century ago. Its pianos are used in 90 percent of concert performances worldwide, the company says. George Gershwin and Vladimir Horowitz played on Steinways. John Lennon composed ''Imagine'' on one.</p>
        <p>Steinway undertook the five-year rehabilitation of the Astoria complex to meet the growing demand for its piano restoration service and for space to store parts. A building that had been closed for a dozen years has been reopened, at a cost of $1 million, while others have been extensively modernized. Altogether, an additional 27,000 square feet of space for building and restoring pianos has been found by reopening or reconfiguring existing buildings.</p>
        <p>All this has taken place on the property where Steinway pianos have been built for almost 130 years, ever since Henry Engelhard Steinway, a German immigrant, moved his factory and headquarters there from Manhattan between 1870 and 1872. Exteriors of the older red brick buildings on the fenced-in property at 1 Steinway Place remain much as they must have looked a century ago, solid and sturdy. The buildings range from 400 square feet to 80,000 square feet, and from one to five stories.</p>
        <p>Some 650 members of Local 102 of the United Furniture Workers of America build about 2,700 grand pianos a year here and 600 uprights, and restore 300 or so. The company's only other factory -- in Hamburg, Germany -- builds about 1,400 pianos, including 200 to 300 uprights.</p>
        <p>Those totals represent about 7 percent of the pianos sold in the United States and 20 percent of total revenue, said Brian Majeski, editor of Music Trades, a magazine in Englewood, N.J. Yamaha, the Japanese company that set up shop in the United States in the early 1970's, has about a 20 percent share of sales and about 30 percent of revenue.</p>
        <p>Because most of the buildings on the site were structurally sound, but in need of modern plumbing, electricity, boilers and roofs, the renovation was aimed primarily at making them more efficient, than at providing more usable space. The company will receive real estate abatements totaling some $7 million over the next 25 years.</p>
        <p>Dennis Tortora, vice president and comptroller, said all 6,000 incandescent bulbs were replaced with energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs. The 1,522 old-fashioned single pane casement windows were replaced with double pane thermal windows. And not only do the new sawdust systems clean the air in the factories, the sawdust is run through a wood-burning boiler to produce steam for conditioning the wood -- each piano is 80 percent wood, of eight kinds -- and for heating and cooling the buildings.</p>
        <p>In casting about for more space, Steinway -- since 1995 a division of Steinway Musical Instruments Inc. of Waltham, Mass. -- decided to reopen a building it had not used for almost a dozen years, except for occasional storage. In addition to a new roof, upgraded wiring and plumbing, a dozen windows were installed to let light through what had been a solid brick exterior.</p>
        <p>That building's 20,000 square feet of work space houses Steinway's growing parts department and its  piano restoration business, a sideline that has expanded to more than 300 a year from about 50 a few years ago.</p>
        <p>A piano restoration takes three to six months, and costs $5,000 to $25,000. New Steinways take about nine months to finish and range in price from about $14,000 to $22,000 for uprights and $32,000 to $85,000 for grand pianos. Instruments with especially elaborate woodwork or decoration, known as art-case pianos, can cost as much as $250,000.</p>
        <p>On any given day, as many as 45 employees, singly or in teams of as many as 10, can typically be found working on restorations, doing everything from sanding or staining piano cases to replacing keys, strings and sound boards.</p>
        <p>One morning, an employee known as a ''tone regulator'' was repeatedly striking a key on a piano that was almost restored to determine the alignment of the hammer and the strings. Doing that on all 88 keys would take about a day, after which the piano would be sent to the next stage, that of polishing the case by hand.</p>
        <p>Although the Steinway family lost control of the company in 1972, when the founder's great-grandson sold it to CBS, it has never stopped building pianos in Astoria, said Michael Anesta, director of human resources. Piano production slowed to a trickle during World War II, when the factory also made coffins and glider parts, in addition to pianos for U.S.O.'s and military bases.</p>
        <p>The Steinway makeover coincides with the 300th anniversary of the invention of the piano by Bartolomeo Cristofori of Florence, Italy.</p>
        <p>A ''Piano 300'' exhibition running through next March at the Smithsonian Institution features not only a grand piano by Cristofori dating from 1722, but also Ignacy Jan Paderewski's grand piano, built by Steinway &amp; Sons in 1892.</p>
        <p>To commemorate the anniversary, Steinway is creating 300 tricentennial grand pianos in collaboration with the furniture designer Dakota Jackson, which will sell for about $80,000 each.</p>
        <p>While Irving Berlin composed on a Weber piano, he appears to have had a soft spot for Steinways: one of his lesser-known songs, ''I Love a Piano,'' contains the line, ''I know a fine way/to treat a Steinway.''</p>
