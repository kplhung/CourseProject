Lucy Edwards, a former bank vice president and a longtime friend of Ms. Kudryavtsev, has pleaded guilty along with her husband, Peter Berlin.

        <p>MANHATTAN: WELFARE SETTLEMENT AFFIRMED -- An appeals court panel has affirmed a settlement of a 1995 federal class-action lawsuit against New York City's child welfare system. Under the settlement, known as Marisol v. Giuliani, child welfare experts are taking two years to review the operations of the Administration of Children's Services. But lawyers for gay and lesbian young people in foster care argued that the settlement offered no relief for their clients. On Monday, the three-member panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said the settlement ''does not have to be perfect, just reasonable and fair.''</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: WOLLMAN RINK ROBBERIES -- Two men were robbed near Wollman Rink in separate incidents in Central Park late Monday, the police said. In the first robbery, at 10:50 p.m., Tang Kheong, 46, of West 51st Street, was knocked to the ground from his bicycle by four or five men, who then robbed him of a pocketknife, sunglasses and $86. Five minutes later, the police said, the same group knocked over a pedestrian, Jose Bueslin, 29, of 47th Avenue in Queens, and robbed him of $10 and a beeper. Mr. Kheong suffered a bruised elbow and Mr. Bueslin was not injured. There have been no arrests.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: RETIREMENT BENEFITS -- Gov. George E. Pataki signed legislation yesterday to increase retirement benefits for state and local government workers. The law provides for an annual cost-of-living adjustment to 1.7 million current and former public employees, at a projected cost of more than $500 million a year for New York City alone. Public employee unions have sought the increase, because most retired public employees collect pensions of less than $15,000 a year, even as state pension funds have grown so rapidly that employers have not needed to make pension contributions in two years.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: NEW TIMES SQUARE HOTEL -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani unveiled plans yesterday for a new hotel near Times Square, and called the planned 45-story building the latest example of the renaissance of the area. The 858-room hotel, which will be called the Westin New York at Times Square, is being built at 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue. It is scheduled to open in fall 2002.</p>

        <p>ROCHESTER: ARCHIMEDES MANUSCRIPT -- Scientists at the Rochester Institute of Technology are restoring part of a 10th-century manuscript, the only known copy in the original Greek of some of the writings of the mathematician Archimedes. Using digital cameras and processing techniques, the scientists captured images of the original words and drawings that were washed away. The team is working as part of a competition that will determine who will analyze the entire manuscript. The Walters Arts Gallery in Baltimore, keeper of the manuscript, expects to make a selection by year's end.</p>

Mr. Backlund will challenge the incumbent, John Larson, a Democrat, for the First District seat. The district, which includes Hartford, is predominantly Democratic.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: GASOLINE ON THE INTERNET -- A New Jersey lawmaker said yesterday that he planned to introduce legislation that would allow consumers to buy gasoline over the Internet. State Senator Joseph F. Vitale, a Democrat of Woodbridge, said allowing New Jersey residents to buy gas through Web sites like Priceline.com might lead to savings of as much as 20 cents a gallon.</p>

Christine Todd Whitman presented a check for $1 million yesterday to help repair the baggage and dormitory buildings, the ones most in danger of collapse.
