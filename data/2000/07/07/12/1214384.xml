        <p>In its biggest test, the new CBS reality series ''Big Brother'' rebounded with some promise on Monday night, once again leading in the 8 p.m. time period.</p>
        <p>After its total audience sunk to about 6 million, the show, which has placed 10 strangers in a house filled with cameras, came back strongly on Monday, pulling in about 10.5 million viewers and once again leading among young adult viewers.</p>
        <p>The performance was closely watched because weak ratings last weekend and an overall downward trend in the number of people tuning in had created some concern at CBS -- and hope at the other networks -- that ''Big Brother'' might not grab the nation's attention as had two previous reality series based on imported models, ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and CBS's ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>''Big Brother'' has been the riskiest reality show because it is on five times a week. It started with an enormous initial rating after CBS placed its first episode after its giant summer hit, ''Survivor.'' ''Big Brother'' had a natural decline in succeeding nights, but by Saturday it was no longer even beating its competition.</p>
        <p>''To a certain extent we were victims of our own success,'' said Chris Ender, the spokesman for CBS Entertainment. ''Being after 'Survivor' set expectations so high.''</p>
        <p>CBS is now confident that ''Big Brother'' will settle in for a successful run and will even build ratings as it begins bouncing people from the house. That process begins tomorrow night, when the participants nominate two members for banishment; viewers will then vote for a week on which one goes.</p>
