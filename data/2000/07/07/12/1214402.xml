      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A listing of cultural events yesterday with an article about Lincoln Center's efforts to broaden its appeal misstated the directing credit for one event and the location of another. The opera ''Writing to Vermeer'' was directed by Peter Greenaway, its librettist, and Saskia Boddeke, not by Robert Wilson.</p>
        <p>''In Spite of Wishing and Wanting,'' a dance by the Belgian choreographer Wim Vandekeybus, will be presented at La Guardia High School, 100 Amsterdam Avenue, at 64th Street, tomorrow and Friday at 8 p.m., not at Avery Fisher Hall.</p>
        <p>In addition, the main article misstated the production schedule of theatrical versions of Bach cantatas created by the director Peter Sellars. They will be part of Lincoln Center's New Visions series in the 2000-01 season; they have not been presented in previous seasons.</p>
