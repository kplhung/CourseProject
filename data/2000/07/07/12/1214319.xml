        <p>Cliff Bayer's fencing coach rarely let him forget the exquisite timing and savvy ruses that make Sergei Goloubitski the world's premier foilist and an Olympic gold medal favorite. Yefim Litvan's praise of Goloubitski, a fellow Ukrainian, sounded to Bayer more like taunting than motivation.</p>
        <p>''It was like taking a knife and throwing it into my side,'' Bayer, 23, said recently in the basement training room of the New York Athletic Club. ''During a lesson he'd say, 'Do like Sergei does; watch a tape of Sergei.' He was always relating to him like a godlike character.''</p>
        <p>That is, until last August, when Bayer faced Goloubitski in the quarterfinals of a World Cup fencing tournament in St. Petersburg, Russia. It was their first encounter since Goloubitski trounced Bayer, then a junior, six years before.</p>
        <p>''He wins a lot with sheer intimidation,'' Bayer said. ''He makes good fencers look like children because of his tricks. He sets up his opponents very well. He has a lot of patience. But when he started his mind games, I didn't listen, which is what he doesn't want you to do.''</p>
        <p>With each touch of Bayer's foil to Goloubitski's torso, disbelief in the crowd swelled. When Bayer refused to apologize for stepping on Goloubitski's foot, the Ukrainian threatened to floor him. When Bayer went on a 4-point binge, Goloubitski shoved him. ''They must have looked at the score when it was 8-2 and thought maybe the light didn't work and it was 8-12,'' Bayer said.</p>
        <p>Bayer won, 15-6, leading Goloubitski to tell Bayer he had been ''too good today.''</p>
        <p>Bayer won the gold in that tournament, but three months later Goloubitski beat him at the world championships in Seoul.</p>
        <p>''Goloubitski, he's No. 1,'' said Simon Gershon, the United States national fencing team's foil coach. ''He's like this,'' Gershon said, raising his right hand six feet high. ''But Cliff, he's like this,'' he said, lowering his hand to three feet.</p>
        <p>The affable, courteous Bayer is the ninth-ranked foilist in the world, ascending to that level because of the victory in Russia, which was followed with another World Cup gold medal in Bonn last April. He qualified for the United States Olympic team on Saturday and is a legitimate hope for a medal in Sydney, a long shot to be the first American to win a gold medal in fencing since Albertson Van Zo Post's ''single sticks'' title in 1904.</p>
        <p>But Bayer is carefully managing his expectations by not letting his natural confidence turn into cockiness about what is possible in Sydney. He knows how quickly a match can end, how quickly hopes can die, and if he forgets, Litvan, his coach, will remind him.</p>
        <p>''His chances are pretty good, but foil is the strongest weapon in the world,'' Litvan said. ''He can win today, but lose tomorrow. Every World Cup, somebody else wins. In Olympics, only God knows.''</p>
        <p>Like Iris Zimmermann, the Rochester foilist whose bronze in November was the first medal won by an American at the world championships, Bayer cannot avoid speculation within the fencing world about being a medal hopeful in a sport usually bereft of successful Americans. The last American to win an Olympic medal was Peter Westbrook, who won a bronze in 1984.</p>
        <p>''I try not to think about it,'' Bayer said. ''I look at the top results I've had and how I fenced, and I was relaxed, I was calm, I wasn't putting pressure on myself. I don't think I'll have a lot of pressure in Sydney, because I'm going in relaxed.''</p>
        <p>He has had mixed results in recent World Cup tournaments, losing in the second round in Portugal, rebounding to win a bronze in Venezuela, then finishing 19th in Cuba.</p>
        <p>''World Cups don't mean anything,'' Andy Shaw, a fencing historian, said. ''The only thing that counts are world championships and the Olympics.''</p>
        <p>Goloubitski owns three consecutive world titles. Bayer has none.</p>
        <p>Bayer has benefited from the influx of former Soviet fencing coaches like Litvan and Gershon, who have tempered his ultra-aggressive impulses and instilled in him some of the patience characteristic of Russian and Ukrainian fencers.</p>
        <p>Litvan recalled 1994, when he became Bayer's coach. ''Cliff was a very aggressive kid,'' Litvan said. ''He liked to fight and be a winner. But his technical skills were limited. He wanted only to attack. He did pretty well for his age, but it took a long time to develop the technical, practical and mental skills to win at senior competition.''</p>
        <p>Litvan's success with Bayer has clearly benefited the teacher, offering proof of what he could not achieve in the Soviet Union. ''I was never a top-level coach in Soviet Union,'' he said. ''I bring what I know to this country and give it to my students. I was like a wild animal in a cage all my life in Soviet Union. When I came here, I blossomed.''</p>
        <p>Bayer is an amalgam of a classic amateur, competing and sacrificing with no chance of a professional future, and an athlete with evident blood lust, even if the end of a foil is blunted. He speaks amiably about extending his natural athletic gift through grueling fencing workouts, with a special emphasis on his footwork augmented by swimming, running, rowing, weight lifting and cycling.</p>
        <p>''I realized when I started fencing that if you work hard and make sacrifices, your results will improve,'' he said. ''I know I'm working for a reason and the work will pay off. It's a very simple equation. You know you're working for a reason and you know the work is going to pay off. There are very few things that give you that kind of security.''</p>
        <p>But with characteristic calm and a coy smile he also describes an insatiable desire to win. ''I'd give my left arm if it wins the bout, if that's what it takes to get to the top,'' he said. ''Everyone is at such a similar skill level that what separates the people who are winning from the people who are losing are the people willing to rip out their guts on the strip and say, 'This match is mine.' ''</p>
        <p>Bayer's love of fencing began at age 7 when he and his brother Greg whacked each other around their family's East Side apartment with ''Star Wars'' toy light sabers. Their duels lasted until some of their mother's fine china crashed to the floor and Greg was sent to a fencing club in Manhattan. A few years later, Cliff followed.</p>
        <p>The younger Bayer's passion for the masked, subtle warfare of fencing bloomed even as Greg's dissipated upon his graduation from Princeton.</p>
        <p>Leading up to the 1996 Summer Games, Bayer, then 19, tasted a little of the publicity accorded a handsome American hopeful in an obscure sport. He appeared in Esquire and Vanity Fair, the latter with commentary written by David Halberstam.</p>
        <p>Bayer was seeded 26th in Atlanta and lost in the first round. He was parrying and advancing on a left knee that needed surgery and was rattled by the enormous crowd in the Georgia World Congress Center.</p>
        <p>''I was nervous and really too motivated, too pumped up,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although the United States fencing team is vastly improved over 1996, the sport's hold on the American imagination is minimal. To many, swordplay is the swashbuckling pursuit of masked Spanish lovers. Needless to say, the United States Fencing Association is not sending a professional Dream Team to Australia.</p>
        <p>And because of the low profile of the sport, even a top-ranked American fencer like Bayer could not enlist one sponsor. His travel to tournaments is paid by the fencing federation -- the better a fencer's results, the more he receives -- support that he augments with earnings from occasional jobs. He is on a sabbatical from studying business at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>''This isn't a job,'' he said. ''I do this for the beauty of it, for the love. What I love is going to a tournament and being in a group that is maybe 80 percent European and being the one American that's able to beat all these people. I love it when people say, 'An American can't make a final eight in a World Cup,' or 'An American can never win a gold.' And I've show all these things are possible.</p>
        <p>''I hope the next thing people say is an American can never win a medal in the Olympics, because I hope to prove them wrong, too.''</p>
