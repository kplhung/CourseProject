        <p>As firefighters and trained dogs searched for her body in the rubble of the leveled building at 420 State Street, Noreen Davidsen was some 60 miles away at her new cottage in, as her answering machine put it, ''beautiful Ocean Grove.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon she had driven away from the garden apartment in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn, leaving behind her photographs, her tax records, her passport -- 18 years of accumulated possessions.</p>
        <p>It came as a complete surprise when, that evening, she got a phone call telling her that she would never see those things again. Her building had collapsed in an explosion.</p>
        <p>Still, she said her first thought was not for her uninsured possessions, but for her landlords and dear friends, Leonard and Harriet Walit. The couple were missing and feared dead after the building was leveled.</p>
        <p>Ms. Davidsen, 58, was not the only person distraught over the looming possibility that the mom and pop of the neighborhood had been lost. ''They were wonderful people in the neighborhood,'' said Maureen Burns, who had lived down the street for 20 years before moving to North Carolina. ''Len used to say, 'My wife never met a stranger.' She was that way. If you walked down the street with her, you would stop 20 times.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Walit, 66, is a retired social worker, just like Ms. Davidsen. Leonard, 72, is a retired accountant.</p>
        <p>''They were the quintessential New York couple,'' said a shaken Ms. Davidsen. ''They loved the theater. They loved music. He was a real intellectual.''</p>
        <p>Every year, she said, they traveled the world, and always visited New Orleans for Mardi Gras. The rest of the time, the Walits cared for each other: both had faltering health.</p>
        <p>The two of them treated Ms. Davidsen, and other neighbors, like family. Kristen Austin, who lived in the neighborhood, said she had seen them just yesterday evening, helping a neighbor struggling to manage an armful of groceries and a baby.</p>
        <p>Ms. Austin said that they then entered their own building, and as she walked away, she heard the thunderous boom of the explosion. Sunday night, she said, had been Ms. Walit's birthday. The couple had no children.</p>
        <p>The couple often went to the theater with their neighbors, two elderly men who lived in the neighboring building.</p>
        <p>Julian Jackson, who Ms. Davidsen said had been a lawyer for the state, and Khay Cochran, an opera singer. The men had a house guest, neighbors said, whose name was Franco. ''They had a beautiful building,'' she said. ''It was full of antiques.''</p>
        <p>After finding out about the explosion, Ms. Davidsen frantically called neighbors back in Brooklyn to find out the fate of her friends.</p>
        <p>''I'm in a state of shock,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson and another man, whose identity was not available, were taken from the house. One refused treatment, and the other was not injured, authorities said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Davidsen turned on the news in Ocean Grove, N.J., but said she could barely watch the footage, which showed piles of rubble where her apartment used to be. ''I lost everything,'' she said. ''I'm wiped out.''</p>
