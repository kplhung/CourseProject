        <p>Gov.

        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman today defended the 1996 trip to Camden in which she cheerfully frisked a black man while accompanying police officers, and suggested that a photograph of the encounter, which surfaced over the  weekend, was being misrepresented and exploited by her political opponents.</p>
        <p>In her first extensive public comments about the frisking, which was photographed when the governor went along with state troopers one night as they patrolled in Camden, Mrs. Whitman brushed aside criticism from civil rights leaders who say her actions showed an insensitivity to the racial profiling allegations that have dogged the New Jersey Police for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>When reporters asked whether she would offer an apology to the man in the picture -- who was stopped for suspicious activity, searched by state troopers, then patted down by the governor and released -- Mrs. Whitman declined. ''An apology would be too easy,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The governor said that in making the rounds with state troopers, she was simply being a ''hands-on governor,'' trying to understand the complexities and dangers of law enforcement. Mrs. Whitman also said her only regret was that the picture  would be used by her political adversaries to detract from her efforts to improve Camden's neighborhoods and her steps to overhaul the state police and discourage discrimination by troopers.</p>
        <p>''Am I sorry that this picture is being taken out of context to undermine the work we've done?'' Mrs. Whitman said. ''Yes. Am I sorry that there is a picture out there that can be extrapolated to try to make me look like something I am not? Of course.</p>
        <p>''But am I sorry that I went in with the state police and I wanted to show them that I would do anything for them? No. The citizens of Camden are better off then they were in 1996.''</p>
        <p>The governor made her statements at a news conference on Ellis Island, where she presented a $1 million check to help rehabilitate part of the immigration museum,  and her remarks were clearly intended to put the controversy behind her. But news coverage of the incident has mounted in recent days, and Mrs. Whitman was followed by a dozen television cameras from local stations and national networks.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Al Sharpton, whose protest against the state police closed down the Atlantic City Expressway last summer, said he and the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey planned to hold protests around the state and at the Republican National Convention late this month. Those demonstrations could be politically embarrassing to Mrs. Whitman, whose supporters have been suggesting her as a possible vice-presidential nominee or, if George W. Bush wins the White House, a cabinet member or ambassador.</p>
        <p>''They say a picture is worth a thousand words,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''It might be worth a vice-presidential nomination.''</p>
        <p>The photograph, taken by a state trooper, was recently subpoenaed as part of a lawsuit by several other officers, who contend that they were victims of discrimination, but has not yet been entered into evidence. The Associated Press obtained a copy last week and it has since been widely publicized.</p>
        <p>According to troopers and a lawyer who is representing officers who are suing the state police, a supervisor whose subordinates went along on the 1996 patrol with Mrs. Whitman had promised a week of paid vacation to any trooper who could return with a picture of the governor's frisking a black suspect, and used a racial slur to describe blacks. Mrs. Whitman said today that she was never told that a reward was being offered for a picture, and that she still thought race had nothing to do with the decision to frisk the man.</p>
        <p>''Race was not a factor,'' Mrs. Whitman said. ''He had already been identified as a suspect.''</p>
        <p>But defense lawyers predicted today that the the photograph would help them fight the criminal case against two troopers charged in the April 1998 shooting that catapulted racial profiling to the top of the state's political agenda. In that shooting, Troopers James Kenna and John Hogan now face charges of attempted murder for wounding three unarmed black men during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike. They are also accused of filing false reports to conceal the race of the drivers they stop.</p>
        <p>If the two troopers stand trial, the picture will be used to assert that officers were encouraged to use race in selecting whom to stop, frisk and arrest, said Jack Arsenault, who represents Mr. Kenna. ''There'll be a lot of evidence that this is how they were trained, that one of the factors in profiling criminals is race,'' Mr. Arsenault said.</p>
        <p>After enduring criticism from Democrats and civil rights leaders for several days, Mrs. Whitman received words of support today from some Republicans, who said she had taken many steps to improve race relations.</p>
        <p>''I don't know her as well as some others, but know her well enough to know that she's not a racist,'' said Tom Wilson, a lobbyist and former executive director of the state's Republican Party. ''And she won't sit back and participate in something that was blatantly, patently unfair, illegal and wrong. She was being the hands-on manager that she is. These troopers were doing a job that Democrats had requested, that the state police step in and lend assistance.''</p>
        <p>The governor echoed those sentiments, suggesting that anyone who views the picture should also consider her entire record as governor.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, the allegations being attached to that photo are not me,'' she said.</p>
