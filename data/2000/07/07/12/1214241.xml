        <p>Until this summer, Wayne Nish, the chef at March in Midtown, often resorted to frozen peas for his ambitious menu. ''Since the packers would freeze the peas while they were still in the fields,'' before their sugar turned to starch, he said, ''frozen peas were generally better than anything fresh that a purveyor sent.''</p>
        <p>But now Mr. Nish has switched to a type of fresh peas that are so old they're new again. He is buying an heirloom variety called Lincoln, peas that are both sweet and tender, ideal for pureeing into a smooth soup garnished with frogs' legs.</p>
        <p>Heirloom tomatoes, apples, beans and potatoes have become almost commonplace in farmers' markets, but this is the first year in which peas have become consistently available in varieties that were grown decades ago, before crossbreeding for long shelf life and truck travel led to vegetables that were more sturdy than sweet and flavorful.</p>
        <p>These are peas with old-fashioned names as distinctive as their irregular pods. Some are sugar snaps, eaten pods and all, and others are peas that need to be shelled. Besides the fat Lincolns favored by Mr. Nish, there are long, slim Waverex Petits Pois, rounded, fat Aldermans, bulging Dwarf Gray Sugars and Mammoth Melting Sugars in paper-thin pods.</p>
        <p>All are carried by David Size, the owner of Heirloom Harvest Farms in Blairstown, N.J., who has a stand in the Union Square Greenmarket on Wednesdays, on the northern edge of the park. Everything he grows, from artichokes to watermelons, is an heirloom -- varieties dating back at least 60  years. But from June through July, his stand is dominated by peas.</p>
        <p>He grows 10 varieties, each distinct in shape and nuance of flavor but all far sweeter than most of the fresh peas available in supermarkets and vegetable stands. They sell for $4 a pound, about the price of regular sugar snap peas at the greenmarket.</p>
        <p>Markets like the Gourmet Garage chain in Manhattan are also selling heirloom peas this year: Alderman, Mammoth Melting Sugar and the original Burpee Sugar Snaps.  They come from Mr. Size and other farmers, including one in Bloomington, N.Y., and are all $3.95 a pound.</p>
        <p>Paulette Satur, owner of the organic Satur Farms in Cutchogue, on Long Island, grows heirloom dwarf sugar snap peas called Sugar Ann to supply restaurants (although the season has ended). She said the decline of commercial peas began when scientists started creating hybrids on a large scale after World War II, crossing a very sweet pea with one that shipped well, for instance, or with one that grew on a bush rather than on a vine. Those hybrids, she said, were ''selected for certain characteristics that aren't necessarily good for the flavor.''</p>
        <p>Sara Jenkins of I Coppi uses the heirloom peas in a soup with crisp prosciutto because ''they taste like they're just picked from the garden -- like they're supposed to.'' And Patricia Williams, the chef of Butterfield 81 on the Upper East Side, is using heirloom peas in a ragout with chorizo, fava beans, heirloom tomatoes and leeks that is served under roasted red snapper. ''The heirlooms have a real sweetness to them,'' she said.  ''Some people will even cook the regular peas with a little bit of sugar, but I don't find you need to do that with the heirloom peas. They have their own sugar.''</p>
        <p>Heirloom peas have to be refrigerated and should be used within two days of when they are bought.</p>
        <p>Bill Telepan of Judson Grill has also been won over by heirloom peas, combining petits pois and sugar snaps in his pea pancakes, which are served as part of an ever-changing vegetable plate. He is such a fan he is adopting a page out of Wayne Nish's old playbook.</p>
        <p>''The season is so short that while we have all the peas I just shell them, throw them in bags and freeze them,'' he said. ''They hold up for three or four months, though we usually go through them before that.''</p>
        <p>HEIRLOOM PEA PANCAKES  Adapted from Judson Grill  Time: 25 minutes</p>
        <p>4 ounces sugar snap peas, trimmed</p>
        <p>1/2 cup freshly shelled green peas  2 tablespoons milk  1 tablespoon heavy cream  1 egg, lightly beaten</p>
        <p>1/4 cup flour</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</p>
        <p>1/8 teaspoon sugar</p>
        <p>1/8 teaspoon salt  2 tablespoons butter  Salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Fill a bowl with ice water. Bring a pot of water to a boil, then lightly salt it. Add sugar snap peas to boiling water, and blanch for 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, and plunge immediately into ice bath. Remove sugar snap peas from ice water, and reserve. Repeat procedure for the shelled peas, blanching them for 3 minutes or until tender. Reserve.</p>
        <p>2. Puree sugar snap peas with the milk and the cream in a blender or food processor. Pour into a large mixing bowl, and whisk in the egg. Sift flour, baking powder, sugar and salt into mixture, and whisk to combine. Coarsely puree reserved shelled peas in food processor, then fold into batter.</p>
        <p>3. In a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, melt  1/2 tablespoon butter. Drop tablespoonfuls of batter into pan. When edges are lightly browned, place pan in oven and bake for 1 1/2 minutes. Remove from oven, and flip pancakes over gently with a spatula. Cook until bottoms are lightly browned; return to oven for another minute. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Repeat process until all batter is used.</p>
        <p>Yield: About 14 pancakes.</p>
        <p>RAGOUT OF PEAS AND CHANTERELLES  Adapted from Peter Hoffman of Savoy  Time: 1 1/2 hours</p>
        <p>1 head garlic</p>
        <p>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil  Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  1 pound chanterelle mushrooms, trimmed  2 leeks, white and tender green part only, chopped  1 cup freshly shelled green peas (from  3/4 pound unshelled).</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Trim garlic head about 1 inch from top, exposing cloves. Place on a piece of aluminum foil, and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and wrap tightly with foil. Roast until cloves are soft and golden brown, about 1 hour. Unwrap, and allow to cool to room temperature. Squeeze roasted garlic out of bulb, and mix with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Tear any large chanterelles into pieces, and reserve. In a large skillet, heat remaining olive oil, and saute leeks with salt and pepper until soft, about 5 minutes. Add chanterelles, and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add peas and a tablespoon of water if mixture looks dry. Cover pan, and cook over low heat until peas are just tender, about 8 minutes. Stir in roasted garlic mixture, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
        <p>PEA SOUP WITH CRISP PROSCIUTTO  Adapted from I Coppi  Time: About 45 minutes</p>
        <p>3 slices prosciutto, halved crosswise  3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, more for drizzling  2 large onions, chopped  Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  3 large Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled and cubed  3 1/2 cups freshly shelled green peas (from 2 1/2 pounds unshelled)  8 ounces sugar snap peas (about 2 cups), trimmed.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Place prosciutto slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake until crisp, about 18 to 20 minutes, turning once. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels, and blot to remove excess oil. Cool.</p>
        <p>2. In a stockpot, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil and saute onions with a pinch of salt over medium heat until soft but not browned, about 10 minutes. Add potatoes, another pinch of salt and just enough water to cover; cook until soft, about 15 minutes. Add shelled peas and sugar snaps with enough hot water just to cover them. Cover pot, and simmer until peas are tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and puree soup in a food processor or blender in small batches. Add salt and pepper to taste. Ladle into soup bowls, and drizzle with olive oil.  Serve with crisped prosciutto on top.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
