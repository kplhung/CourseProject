        <p>PARIS in the spring is an amalgam of every luscious cliche, all the 40's movies in which lovers stroll arm in arm along a misty Seine, all the scratchy Edith Piaf recordings paying tribute to romance and loss, all the Impressionist paintings that capture the verve and atmosphere of this most beguiling of cities. Yet there is something oddly familiar about the sight before my eyes -- perfectly folded stacks of stone-washed jeans, endless piles of rainbow-colored T-shirts, crisp arrangements of khaki pants and, most of all, the distinctive, no-frills navy and white logo.</p>
        <p>Well, duh, as my 13-year-old daughter would say, throwing me a look. Of course it's familiar. We're in a Gap, a Gap on an enchanting Left Bank street a good 3,000 miles from our Gap in Brooklyn (and our Gap in Midtown Manhattan and our Gap in SoHo), but a Gap nevertheless.</p>

        <p>PARIS in the spring is an amalgam of every luscious cliche, all the 40's movies in which lovers stroll arm in arm along a misty Seine, all the scratchy Edith Piaf recordings paying tribute to romance and loss, all the Impressionist paintings that capture the verve and atmosphere of this most beguiling of cities. Yet there is something oddly familiar about the sight before my eyes -- perfectly folded stacks of stone-washed jeans, endless piles of rainbow-colored T-shirts, crisp arrangements of khaki pants and, most of all, the distinctive, no-frills navy and white logo.</p>
        <p>Well, duh, as my 13-year-old daughter would say, throwing me a look. Of course it's familiar. We're in a Gap, a Gap on an enchanting Left Bank street a good 3,000 miles from our Gap in Brooklyn (and our Gap in Midtown Manhattan and our Gap in SoHo), but a Gap nevertheless.</p>
        <p>And why are we in a Gap in Paris when we could be strolling along that fabled river or gazing up at equally fabled chestnut trees, or wandering down adorably twisting streets studded with enticing cafes? Probably for the same reason we recently spent several golden hours at a Gap in San Francisco -- because in my daughter's eyes there is nothing as satisfying to the soul as shopping, particularly in an environment that feels like home. This is a girl who will never have to read ''The Accidental Tourist.''</p>
        <p>My husband thinks we're insane to spend a single moment of precious vacation time this way. ''You're going to a Gap?'' he'll exclaim as we set off. ''You're crazy! You can do that at home.'' I can't argue with him. As we sheepishly slink out of our hotel room, I know he's right.</p>
        <p>At least in Paris, I told myself, we were getting a whiff of foreign flavor: the tags on the merchandise (50 francs for un chemisier, available in petit or grand); the accents of the sales clerks, who, of course, all spoke impeccable English. But at the San Francisco Gap, there was not even that consolation. As with all big chains, there is minimal difference among outlets. If I had doubts about this, they disappeared the day I complimented a clerk in a Midtown Manhattan Gap (where my daughter and I are such faithful customers, we are on a first-name basis with much of the staff) about an artful display of bathing suits. In response, the clerk showed me the playbook that spells out how merchandise is supposed to be arranged at every store throughout the great Gap empire, down to the placement of the last sock.</p>
        <p>The closest I've come to breaking this cycle is taking my daughter to the major French department stores, which offer the advantages not only of more authentically French merchandise but also of superior design. The attractions at le Printemps included an extraordinary stained-glass cupola that loomed closer and closer as we ascended on the escalator. The roof of Samaritaine offered drop-dead panoramic views of the city, complete with a legend embedded in the parapet detailing exactly what we were seeing. We weren't shopping, I told myself; we were discovering Parisian architecture. (Right. And we had the receipts to prove it.)</p>
        <p>To be honest, I feel a little guilty about all this. I worry that I am raising a philistine, or that I myself am a philistine, or, at the very least, a far too indulgent parent. One part of me thinks a proper mother would nip this sort of behavior in the bud. ''No, dear, no Gap today,'' such a mother would announce. ''We're off to the Cluny Museum to see the real unicorn tapestries.''</p>
        <p>AS a result of my guilt, I've given considerable thought to this subject, and I've come to a few conclusions. One has to do with a theory about children and vacations: they do not like to travel too much because they like their lives and see no need to change them. When I bounced this theory off my daughter, she agreed absolutely. ''Kids don't want to go on vacation in the first place,'' she pointed out. ''At least in a Gap you're doing something useful, something you might actually like to do at home.''</p>
        <p>My other conclusion involves the famous McDonald's syndrome. When McDonald's branches began sprouting around the globe, sociologists offered endless analyses of their appeal, which boiled down to the fact that Americans abroad felt pretty much like dolts when it came to handling foreign currency, ordering from foreign menus and asking directions of people who didn't have the faintest idea what they were saying. By contrast, Americans felt supremely comfortable in a McDonald's. They knew how to behave under the golden arches; they knew where to walk and what words to utter. You didn't have to be Francois Mitterrand to order le Big Mac, even with fromage.</p>
        <p>So, too, in a Gap. ''Gap is comforting,'' acknowledged Amy Maniatis, the company's director of public relations. ''It's reassuring. There are no surprises.'' She sometimes visits Gaps when she travels, and not just for work-related reasons. ''I can't believe I've crossed the globe to go into a Gap,'' she admitted ruefully, ''but there it is.''</p>
        <p>As for the much-vaunted newness that travel is supposed to offer, Ms. Maniatis thinks a little newness goes a long way. ''You need some,'' she said, ''but not all.''</p>
