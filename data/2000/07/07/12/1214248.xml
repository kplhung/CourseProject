        <p>SUMMER in the city has certain charms, but do-it-yourself outdoor grilling is not one of them. City officials frown on fires in the parks, and regulators (and co-op boards) are no more amenable to propane grills on terraces and balconies.</p>
        <p>But this summer a handful of Manhattan restaurants have set up grills on terraces, rooftops and sidewalks to provide the suburban pleasures of steaks, chicken, hamburgers and hot dogs right off the coals, along with the bonus of views of boats on the Hudson River and helicopters whirling over the East River. Even these professional grill-masters are subject to frequent inspections by the Fire Department, though.</p>
        <p>The settings and the food are varied, from almost picnic-style to bordering on posh, with prices starting at $3.50 (at the 79th Street Boat Basin Cafe) and running all the way up to $42 (at Patroon).</p>
        <p>Five Points, on Great Jones Street just off the Bowery in NoHo, has a menu of items cooked on a shiny charcoal rig set right on the sidewalk at one end of the restaurant's outdoor cafe. ''It's relaxed, and it gives me a chance to be part of the dining atmosphere,'' said the chef, Marc Meyer. Mr. Meyer does his grilling just steps from one of the city's more beautiful firehouses. ''We had to have a sidewalk permit and be inspected by the Fire Department,'' he said. ''Aside from that, we encountered no other regulations. And we spent months investigating.''</p>
        <p>He grills footlong hot dogs, as well as quail with brandied cherries, Gulf shrimp with peach chutney and citrus-marinated  chicken. The restaurant's regular menu is also served at the outdoor tables. Great Jones is a wide, lightly trafficked street, making for a pleasant sidewalk setting.</p>
        <p>Sonora, in the Eastgate Hotel on East 39th Street, offers a grill menu Wednesday through Saturday evenings, emphasizing South American pinchos: a few bites of skewered meats, like steak, sausages (including blood sausage) and chicken, often bathed in citrus juice and served with salsa or Cuban mojo sauce. Sometimes a fish special or a main course steak is also cooked on the grill. The grilling area has something of a formal garden setting, just outside the restaurant.</p>
        <p>At some of these places, like the 79th Street Boat Basin Cafe on the Hudson River, it's completely dressed down, with adults and children in shorts and T-shirts. Plastic plates, cups and utensils and wicker baskets are the rule here, even with main dishes like grilled tuna -- and there are plastic water bowls for dogs. Getting to the cafe involves some walking, either from Riverside Drive or Riverside Park, or from the 79th Street underpass to the Henry Hudson Parkway. The outdoor kitchen is set up under the viaduct's arches, which make the cafe look like a poor man's Guastavino's. It has a surprisingly ambitious menu, with not just hot dogs and hamburgers sizzled on the grill, but also salmon and steak and a terrific Irish banger sausage on a bun.</p>
        <p>On the East River, the Crow's Nest on the roof of the Water Club has a brief menu of sandwiches and snack foods like shrimp cocktail, calamari and hot dogs and hamburgers off a charcoal grill to accompany drinks at what is primarily a bar.</p>
        <p>The outdoor setup is more elaborate at Cafe St. Bart's, with umbrella-shaded tables on a broad, surprisingly tranquil terrace adjacent to St. Bartholomew's Church on 50th Street and Park Avenue. The menu includes not just chicken and lamb and striped bass off a grill but also pizzas baked in an outdoor stone oven that was built to reflect the Byzantine-style architecture of the church.</p>
        <p>Under the umbrellas at Rock Center Cafe, on West 49th Street in Rockefeller Center, big smokers are turning out slabs of tender Texas brisket and ribs, under the guidance this summer of Don Strange of San Antonio. The barbecue is served at dinner; hamburgers and steaks are the only other items that are regularly grilled outdoors for the cafe or for the Rink Bar, which occupies the central garden area at the foot of the Prometheus fountain.</p>
        <p>And at Patroon on East 46th Street, Ken Aretsky, the owner, is taking casual Fridays one step further, grilling over a mixture of hardwoods on the restaurant's rooftop every Friday this summer. The menu is simple, with shrimp, fish, vegetables, burgers and hot dogs. The hot dogs are two feet long and served on brioche, perhaps justifying the $16 price tag. A prime aged sirloin steak is $42.</p>
        <p>In all these places, especially if you sit near the grill, you get a good whiff of charcoal smoke with dinner.</p>
        <p>They're all easy to find. Just follow your nose.</p>
        <p>GRILLED CITRUS-MARINATED POUSSIN  Adapted from Five Points  Time: about an hour, plus 3 to 4 hours' marinating</p>

        <p>3. Trim steak of all fat. Cut in strips  1/2 inch thick and 3 inches long. Add to bowl and mix to coat. Marinate 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>4. Combine remaining garlic with oregano, thyme, stock and lime juice in small saucepan, and simmer 5 minutes. Add remaining cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.</p>
        <p>5. Weave steak strips onto skewers. Grill about 3 minutes on each side, to desired degree of doneness. Arrange on platter. Whisk butter into sauce, serve with steak.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
