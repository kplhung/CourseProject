        <p>''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' got its first chance to go head to head with ''Big Brother'' last night, and once again its timing was impeccable: the hit game show produced yet another million-dollar winner, its sixth.</p>
        <p>This is less than a week after the show produced millionaire No. 5, who appeared on the first new ''Millionaire'' show after two weeks of repeats.</p>
        <p>This confluence of competitively advantageous timing has begun to raise at least a few eyebrows from the aggressively suspicious. During a telephone news conference yesterday the newest millionaire, David Goodman from Olney, Md., was asked whether he had any suspicions about the types of questions he was asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman, a consultant with an environmental company in Virginia who recently received a master's degree in public policy from the University of Michigan, said that he had watched the show avidly and almost always did extremely well. In the case of at least one earlier million-dollar winner, he said, he was certain he, too, would have won that night.</p>
        <p>But he added, ''It certainly helped a lot that the questions were by and large things I could work with.''</p>
        <p>In one case, he said, he was asked about the derivation of the name Lilith, and he was gratified that it related to something he was familiar with, the first books of the Old Testament and what he called ''Hebrew myth,'' as opposed to something in the New Testament. ''Then I'd have been in trouble,'' Mr. Goodman said.</p>
        <p>That question was worth $250,000. The four choices: Lot's wife, Adam's first wife, Helen of Troy, Muse of Lyric Poetry. He answer was Adam's first wife.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman was so strong during the game that he did not need any of the three lifelines the show affords contestants until he reached the final question. He then won $1 million by knowing that the British children's-book character Paddington Bear arrived in England from Peru.</p>
        <p>He had already narrowed the four possible choices to two, the other being Iceland. Then he got the audience members to vote, and they only slightly favored Peru. So he phoned a friend who steered him in the right direction.</p>
