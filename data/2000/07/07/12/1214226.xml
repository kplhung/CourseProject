        <p>THREE weeks ago, Pat Malloy of Polk City, Fla., climbed into her 35-foot motor home and drove five hours to Tallahassee to pick up her daughter and son-in-law, along with their 22-month-old daughter and 3-year-old son. They then  took off for Timberville, Va., to visit Mrs. Malloy's son and his family before heading toward Lancaster, Pa., so the children could ride Tommy-the-Train-Engine at the Strasburg Rail Road nearby.</p>
        <p>''Except for fuel prices that are out of sight this summer, it was a wonderful week and a half,'' said Mrs. Malloy, a retired high school principal and widow who cherishes the time she spends with her 5 children and 15 grandchildren. So much so that she thinks nothing of driving three days to and from Oklahoma City with grandchildren in tow to visit her daughter, her son-in-law and their five children. ''It's important to keep in touch with my children and grandchildren, and for them to keep in touch with each other,'' Mrs. Malloy said.</p>

        <p>THREE weeks ago, Pat Malloy of Polk City, Fla., climbed into her 35-foot motor home and drove five hours to Tallahassee to pick up her daughter and son-in-law, along with their 22-month-old daughter and 3-year-old son. They then  took off for Timberville, Va., to visit Mrs. Malloy's son and his family before heading toward Lancaster, Pa., so the children could ride Tommy-the-Train-Engine at the Strasburg Rail Road nearby.</p>
        <p>''Except for fuel prices that are out of sight this summer, it was a wonderful week and a half,'' said Mrs. Malloy, a retired high school principal and widow who cherishes the time she spends with her 5 children and 15 grandchildren. So much so that she thinks nothing of driving three days to and from Oklahoma City with grandchildren in tow to visit her daughter, her son-in-law and their five children. ''It's important to keep in touch with my children and grandchildren, and for them to keep in touch with each other,'' Mrs. Malloy said.</p>
        <p>For years, family travel meant primarily children and parents, or children and parents visiting grandparents and vice versa. Plenty of that still goes on, but family travel now often means extended families, including grandparents, aunts, uncles and even best friends.</p>
        <p>According to the Travel Industry Association of America, 20 percent of all family trips in 1998 spanned three generations; in the previous year, it was 16 percent. That does not include the undetermined but growing number of trips with just grandchildren and grandparents -- either trips designed that way or because neither parent could get away.</p>
        <p>Plenty of grandparents lack money or time to travel with children or grandchildren, often because they are trying to help the grandchildren's parents, many of whom are divorced, separated or single. Last July, the Census Bureau reported that in 1997, 5.4 million children, or 7.7. percent of all American children that year, were living with a grandparent. And about two-thirds of the grandchildren in homes maintained by a grandmother without a spouse, or without the children's parents present, were in poverty.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, by almost every indicator, most grandparents are living longer and are very likely to have traveled widely. And after having paid off mortgages and tuition, they have more disposable income. Because many older people are still active, it is not unusual to find them hiking, skiing, climbing mountains and white-water rafting.</p>
        <p>Charles and Virginia Soucy, a retired couple in their 70's who divide their time between Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Rollinford, N.H., are celebrating their 50th anniversary with an eight-day trip to Canada with a  friend and 20 family members -- their 5 children, the children's spouses and 10 grandchildren, including a 3-year-old grandson. Two days will include helihiking -- flying by helicopter to the Bugaboo Mountains in the Purcell Range of the Rockies, and being dropped off in a wilderness area for hiking and picnicking.</p>
        <p>''Our 3-year-old isn't likely to come along,'' Mr. Soucy said, ''but the rest of us have done a lot of hiking and skiing, and we're in pretty good shape.''</p>
        <p>To celebrate their 40th anniversary last summer, Douglas and Ann Scott, of Alexandria, Va., traveled to a dude ranch near Harrison, Idaho, with their three children, their spouses, three grandchildren and the maid of honor at their wedding.</p>
        <p>''We never really traveled much in this country,'' said Mrs. Scott, adding that they had lived in China, Indonesia, Uganda and Ghana while her husband was an official with the International Monetary Fund, from which he retired four years ago. ''We love being with our children and their spouses, and this gave us the opportunity.''</p>
        <p>The most popular family travel destinations, according to the Travel Industry Association of America, a nonprofit group, continue to be beaches or lakes, visiting friends or relatives, historic sites, amusement parks and national parks. Sixty-eight  percent of recreational vehicle owners (who usually sleep and cook in their vehicles) are expected to take their children or grandchildren when they travel this summer, up from 41 percent three years ago, according to a poll commissioned by the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association.</p>
        <p>A growing number of grandparents regard intergenerational travel as an educational experience for their grandchildren, and willingly foot the bill, which can reach $10,000 for an adult and a child on an overseas tour. ''Many of the grandparents are well educated, well traveled and desperate to introduce the world and its cultures to their grandchildren,'' said Helena T. Koenig, the founder of Grandtravel, whose trips are exclusively for grandparents and grandchildren ages 7 to 17.</p>
        <p>FOUNDED 15 years ago in Chevy Chase, Md., Grandtravel offered two domestic tours, as well as one to Kenya. Today, it offers seven domestic tours (including New York, Washington and Alaska) and 14 international tours (including Britain, France, Australia and the Galapagos Islands). Its 10-day tour to London and Paris, departing next month, will include a great-grandmother and her great-granddaughter, the first such couple in Grand travel's history. That trip costs about $10,500 for two, not including round-trip air fare to London and home from Paris.</p>
        <p>Family Hostel, founded nine years ago at the University of New Hampshire, has scheduled nine trips this summer for grandparents, parents and grandchildren ages 8 to 16 -- and all nine sold out well in advance. Next year, it plans to sponsor 14 tours, including France, Switzerland and a cruise to Alaska.</p>
        <p>''Extended family travel is going to continue,'' said Robert P. McCaffery, the director of Family Hostel, ''because what we're seeing is grandparents and grandchildren who once lived in the same town, often on the same street, now often live far apart.''</p>
        <p>Many intergenerational trips take place at resorts or aboard cruise ships, which pride themselves on offering activities for all ages. About 40 percent of Disney Cruise Line voyages include grandparents and grandchildren, said Kiersten Murnane, a spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>But it isn't just the big cruise lines that attract families. Fifty-one percent of the passengers who sailed last year with Lindblad Expeditions, for example, were parents traveling with their families, and 15 percent of Lindblad's passengers in the past two years have been part of a three-generation group, usually on trips to the Galapagos and Alaska.</p>
        <p>Late last month, Nancy and Frank Vydra, of Northbrook, Ill. -- together with their three children ages 10 to 15, Mrs. Vydra's brother, Bill Gibson, and her mother, Peggy Gibson, departed on a 14-day cruise aboard the 731-passenger World Explorer from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Valdez, Alaska, to Vancouver.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Vydra, a real-estate agent, said the family had decided on a cruise because ''friends and customers told me they took their children on cruises, and said there was lots to do and you didn't have to worry about where to go to dinner.''</p>
