      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says fighting AIDS epidemic in South Africa is not helped when Pres Thabo Mbeki voices doubts about whether HIV causes AIDS, since this discourages the use of condoms; also notes that government failed to spend millions of dollars of last year's AIDS budget on time; supports government's proposal for making cheap versions of still-patented AIDS drugs or importing them at less than the makers charge</p>

        <p>South Africa, the host of the world AIDS conference this week, has 4.2 million people who are infected with the AIDS virus, more than any other nation. It also has the world's fastest-growing epidemic, with infection rates that rose from 13 percent to 20 percent in the last two years. While AIDS is tragic everywhere, it is particularly so in South Africa, a nation with a wealthier and more effective government and health care system than other sub-Saharan African countries.</p>
        <p>South Africa has an extensive program of AIDS education, and most of its citizens know what H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, is and how it is transmitted. Yet that has not led to the practice of safe sex. South Africa needs creative solutions to cut the prevalence of AIDS among groups such as miners and truck drivers, whose itinerancy contributes  greatly to the disease's spread. It needs money to care for orphaned children, and to extend its clinics and hospitals to poor areas, train and hire health workers and buy equipment and drugs.</p>

        <p>South Africa, the host of the world AIDS conference this week, has 4.2 million people who are infected with the AIDS virus, more than any other nation. It also has the world's fastest-growing epidemic, with infection rates that rose from 13 percent to 20 percent in the last two years. While AIDS is tragic everywhere, it is particularly so in South Africa, a nation with a wealthier and more effective government and health care system than other sub-Saharan African countries.</p>
        <p>South Africa has an extensive program of AIDS education, and most of its citizens know what H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, is and how it is transmitted. Yet that has not led to the practice of safe sex. South Africa needs creative solutions to cut the prevalence of AIDS among groups such as miners and truck drivers, whose itinerancy contributes  greatly to the disease's spread. It needs money to care for orphaned children, and to extend its clinics and hospitals to poor areas, train and hire health workers and buy equipment and drugs.</p>
        <p>President Thabo Mbeki's musings on whether H.I.V. actually causes AIDS are unhelpful and have discouraged condom use. Millions of dollars of last year's AIDS budget in South Africa were not spent on time. Mr. Mbeki's government only recently reversed its policy that the drug AZT, used worldwide to cut mother-to-child transmission, was unsafe. Stronger leadership on the problem in Uganda and Senegal has helped to reduce the prevalence of infection in those countries. A frank and vocal approach to AIDS from high-level officials can promote safe sex and reduce the stigma of AIDS, which is so great in South Africa that people shun available services and refuse to wear condoms or bottle-feed infants for fear others will suspect.</p>
        <p>Since South Africa's health system does function in many places, it is in a better position than its neighbors -- which will need Western help to build health systems from scratch -- to offer real treatment, perhaps even the protease inhibitors that have made AIDS a more manageable disease for the wealthy. Treatment also gives people a reason to get tested, slowing the spread of AIDS.</p>
        <p>The biggest obstacle is the cost of medicine, which is often higher in South Africa than in Europe. In recent months pharmaceutical companies, the World Bank, governments and foundations have promised donations of drugs or new money, in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars' worth. Donated drugs are important, but South Africa is proposing a more sustainable solution -- making cheap versions of still-patented drugs or importing them at less than the makers charge. These steps were blocked by Washington -- which has since changed its view -- and the pharmaceutical industry. Wealthy countries should support South Africa, and help all of Africa to get drugs at the lowest possible prices.</p>
