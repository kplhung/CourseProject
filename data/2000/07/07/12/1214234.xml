        <p>You are eagerly anticipating a trip to one of the world's great cities, but dreading the thought of looking like a tourist. What to do? Just leave those bright plaid Bermuda shorts at home, and follow these tips from Times correspondents.</p>
        <p>IT is fairly easy for visitors to New York to blend in these days because so many of the city's residents are newly arrived themselves.</p>
        <p>Granted, six platinum blondes standing together on a mid-Manhattan corner and talking in lyrical Southern accents are not likely to be confused with locals. But aside from that situation and a few others (odds are pretty good, for example, that someone speaking excellent English is from out of town), it is getting harder all the time to tell who's an outlander.</p>
        <p>Still, there are dead giveaways. One of the best is also one of the  oldest. Lollygagging on the street, especially while also stopping to gawk at the tall buildings, is definitely the sign of someone who is in town for a short while.</p>
        <p>To avoid being pegged for a tourist, walk like a New Yorker, which means moving with a rapid, purposeful stride, eyes fixed straight ahead. The idea of seeming not to know where you're going is as repugnant to most New Yorkers as putting mayonnaise on a pastrami sandwich.</p>
        <p>There is no need to be rude about it. Saying ''Sorry'' as you brush past  someone is perfectly acceptable. Somehow, there is this notion that New Yorkers are gratuitously and inordinately ill-mannered. That is not so. They say ''Excuse me'' and ''That's O.K.'' the same as anyone else. Just not as often.</p>
        <p>It would not hurt to sprinkle an occasional ''Yo'' in your sentences,  including the apologies. That could go a long way to making people think you are city-born. You hear ''Yo'' all the time.</p>
        <p>''Yo, which way to Times Square?''</p>
        <p>''You got the time, yo?''</p>
        <p>Those qualify as properly worded questions in early-21st-century New York.</p>
        <p>''Yo'' is so commonplace that a friend has suggested that a fair test  of a sophisticated New Yorker is whether he knows the difference between Yo-Yo Ma and Yo Mama.</p>
        <p>Familiarity with a little Yiddish would also help. No one suggests mastering the collected works of Isaac Bashevis Singer. But Yiddish has entered the New York vernacular to such an extent that some  words are instantly familiar to people who emigrated from points as distant as Peshawar and Quito. This is especially true of words that begin with the ''sch'' sound.</p>
        <p>Let's say you want cream cheese on a bagel for breakfast. (If you're not sure what a bagel is, you might want to go elsewhere on vacation.) Ask for a bagel with a schmear. Not ''smear,'' a usage that will blow your cover right away. The correct New York word for a layer of cream cheese is a Yiddish-inflected ''schmear.''</p>
        <p>Actually, whatever the language, getting the pronunciation right is key  to passing for a New Yorker.</p>
        <p>Consider a visit that the typical tourist might make to SoHo. The  name, which sounds stolen from a London neighborhood, is actually shorthand for the area south of Houston Street. New Yorkers know that street as ''How-stin.'' Trust us. If you go to SoHo and say ''Yew-stin,'' you've got a problem.</p>
