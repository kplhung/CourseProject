        <p>One spring when I was young, I quit a job, converted my assets to traveler's checks and took a three-month holiday in Europe. As this mad interlude drew to a close, I found myself in Athens with $200 to my name. In light of my reduced circumstances, I checked into the Pankration Pension for Young Ladies, a clean, well-lighted dormitory offering bed and shower for 90 cents a night.</p>
        <p>There, I met three spinsters from Akron, Ohio. They took a kindly interest in me, and one night, when I was running a fever, they shared their supplies of bottled water. The following morning, though I was still wobbly, they insisted I accompany them to a summer festival on the Saronic Gulf. So we set out in their rented Volvo across the Isthmus of Corinth, stopping for a swim in the Aegean.</p>

        <p>It was past dusk when we reached the town of Epidaurus. The driver, Johanna, parked the car in a lot at the foot of a grove of old cedars and beckoned us to follow her up a mountain path. It was perfectly quiet, except for the crunch of pine needles beneath our feet, and it was very dark. We crested a bluff and below us spread a huge and ancient amphitheater ablaze with lights and packed with 14,000 spectators.</p>
        <p>The play had started and by the time we found seats, Orestes had begun his flight from the Furies, played by a chorus in tattered gray robes. They turned the robes inside out in one graceful gesture, revealing pink undercloaks as they changed into Eumenides.</p>
        <p>The dialogue was in Greek. I don't know whether I was hallucinating or whether I was under some enchantment of an August night in the Peloponnesus, but I understood every word.</p>
