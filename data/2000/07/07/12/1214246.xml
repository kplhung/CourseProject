      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>It's not just first ladies -- or aspiring ones -- who bake cookies. Serious home cooks have long relied on the KitchenAid standing mixer.  But because even the five-quart model had a hard time handling double batches of cookie dough or some heavy bread doughs, the company came up with a new model, the Professional 6. It has a six-quart bowl with a wider mouth, a 525-watt motor (upgraded from 350 watts) and an angled dough hook. The mixer handled a double batch of chocolate chip cookies like a charm, and the dough hook is excellent. But it is somewhat noisier than the other KitchenAid models. It is $359.98 at Zabar's, 80th Street and Broadway, in white, black or gray.</p>
