        <p>The reality television juggernaut continues, now on cable, where it actually began, with MTV's ''Real World'' and HBO's ''Taxicab Confessions.''</p>
        <p>On Monday HBO executives told television writers gathered in Pasadena, Calif., for the twice-yearly Television Critics Association tour that they were introducing a new reality show produced by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, the screenwriting and acting duo, who are also producing a reality show for ABC.</p>
        <p>Called ''Greenlight,'' the new HBO show will follow the travails and triumphs of a first-time filmmaker who is to be chosen from among the thousands of everyday people HBO expects to respond to its open call for screenplays, which will be submitted over the Internet.</p>
        <p>The show will track the filmmaker throughout the process of making a small, independent-style film, which HBO, in partnership with Miramax, will release in theaters at the end of the show's run.</p>
        <p>Mr. Affleck and Mr. Damon will be seen in the series and will also be executive producers of the film. But a representative from their company, Pearl Street Productions, said they did not want to become focal points of the series, which will not be shown on HBO until early in 2002.</p>
        <p>''We don't want it to be about Matt and Ben,'' said Kent Kubena, vice president for development at Pearl Street. ''We want it to be about the filmmaker.''</p>
        <p>So of course the filmmaker will not be chosen only on screenwriting skills, but also on issues of personality, Mr. Kubena said.</p>
        <p>This is the second reality series that Mr. Damon and Mr. Affleck are producing. They recently sold ABC a show called ''The Runner,'' in which one contestant will embark on a cross-country trek during which he or she will have to perform specified tasks while trying to avoid being spotted by viewers.</p>
