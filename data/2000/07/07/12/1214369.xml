        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''What Death-Penalty Errors?'', by James Q. Wilson (Op-Ed, July 10), about the study that I led about error rates in capital cases:</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson suggests that outcomes on retrial gauge the seriousness of the many flawed death verdicts we found but says we don't know what occurred at retrial after the ''great majority'' of state post-conviction reversals.</p>
        <p>In fact, we know what happened in most of those cases: Correcting the errors changed 82 percent of the outcomes, including 7 percent when death-row inmates were not guilty. Most errors were a result of incompetent defense lawyers and police suppressing evidence -- hardly technicalities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson suggests that high capital error rates don't matter until we prove that an innocent person was executed. By this logic, we should ignore a meat plant's high rate of E.  coli bacteria until we know that one of its hamburgers killed someone.</p>
        <p>Once states begin supporting ''innocence autopsies'' instead of destroying DNA and similar evidence, high rates of serious error make it likely that researchers will show that an innocent person has been executed.</p>
