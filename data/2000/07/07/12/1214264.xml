        <p>THE signing of the check at Alain Ducasse is a special moment. No matter how lively the chatter at the table has been, a hush descends, and tense faces regard the slick, itemized printout in their midst with unfeigned awe. With exquisite timing, a waiter appears and holds up a velvet display board containing a dozen finely made pens. It's hard not to feel that you are about to sign a document imposing humiliating terms of surrender. It's a measure of the delicacy at Ducasse that you are allowed to do it in high style.</p>
        <p>With the arrival of Alain Ducasse at the Essex House, a new era in New York dining has begun. It is far too early to draw any conclusions about the food. But the style, the rituals and the price structure are already in place. Dining at Ducasse is like learning to eat all over again. And New Yorkers are falling all over themselves to take lessons.</p>
        <p>Nothing gets New York's blood up like the challenge of an unattainable reservation. It's like a dripping hunk of red meat hung just out of reach of a pack of howling dogs. And that's exactly what Mr. Ducasse offered when he announced, some months ago, that he and his eight-star Michelin reputation would be taking up residence in the Essex House, in the dining rooms of what used to be Les Celebrites. Getting in would be half the challenge. The restaurant seats 65, and there would be one seating a night. Lunch would be offered twice a week. The restaurant would be closed on weekends.</p>
        <p>The second half of the challenge would be the bill. In a bold see-you, raise-you move, Mr. Ducasse declared that his prix-fixe would cost $160, far more than even the most expensive four-star Manhattan restaurants. As it turned out, the a la carte menu also scaled new heights. Appetizers reached the thrilling $50 level. Entrees toyed with $75, then mincingly retreated to $74. The message was clear: if you wanted to dine at Ducasse, money would be no object. But then, it would be a meal cooked by the world's most celebrated chef.</p>
        <p>Clearly, Mr. Ducasse understood a thing or two about marketing. The moment the phone and fax lines at Ducasse were plugged in, the rush was on. Within days, the waiting list for a table was reported to be 2,700 names long. And faithful patrons of Mr. Ducasse's restaurants in Europe have first call on the tables. At the moment, the restaurant is not taking reservations. Tables are booked through October, and November reservations cannot be made until Aug. 1. Anyone lucky enough to secure a reservation must leave a credit-card deposit of $150 a person.</p>
        <p>Die-hard foodies were staring straight into the abyss. Like everyone else, I was on the outside looking in. In order to remain anonymous, I have to make reservations in the guise of an ordinary diner (and sign the bill with a pseudonym as well). But ordinary diners, at the moment, have less than a snowball's chance of landing a table at Ducasse.</p>
        <p>After I'd spent a week scratching my head over the problem and making no progress, fate intervened. An acquaintance who had finagled a table by posing as a longtime Ducasse patron decided that his credit card might not be up to the near-decathlon trial of strength that it would face at the restaurant. Would I care to step into the breach?</p>
        <p>You bet.</p>
        <p>What follows is an account of My Dinner With Alain. It is not a review. The New York Times would never review a restaurant open only two weeks, and after only one visit. In fact, given the difficulties of landing a reservation, it's anyone's guess when a review might materialize. One visit took some scheming. Repeating the feat four or five times will require cunning, extraordinary luck or Zenlike patience.</p>
        <p>But like Howard Carter after penetrating the tomb of Tutankhamen, I feel compelled to offer the world a glimpse of the splendors I have witnessed.</p>
        <p>Les Celebrites was an elegant room, and after a $2 million renovation, so is Ducasse. The main dining room, now outfitted with back-to-back circular booths and well-spaced tables, has a luxurious feel, with Brazilian rosewood walls and silk upholstery whose wavy motif suggests rippling water. Throw pillows in the booths add a sybaritic touch. In a direct assault on Manhattan manners, waiters propose that the women let loose their purses and rest them on silk-wrapped cubes thoughtfully placed at table side.</p>
        <p>The Celebrites paintings by Elke Sommer and Phyllis Diller have disappeared, to be replaced by some appalling works by the cosmically awful Arman. On this occasion, he has glued trumpets, French horns and other brass instruments to brown linen canvas and dripped thick, waxy strands of color over them. They make a very odd partner to a series of large black-and-white landscape photographs. I did not penetrate the secret recesses of the Salon de Soie, a private dining room that seats 12, or eat at the 200-year-old oak chef's table in the kitchen. Perhaps later.</p>
        <p>Ducasse makes every effort to assure diners that they are getting special treatment. The special-effects parade begins with mineral water, offered in a stainless steel carrier pack that holds a half-dozen varieties. To read the wine list, a tall foldout card with five panels, requires breaking a wax seal. When diners leave the table, their entree is transferred to a warming cart. At the end of the meal, a cart bearing pots of growing herbs makes the rounds. The diner who desires a verbena tea gets to watch a waiter grasp the plant in a white-gloved hand and then snip a few leaves with a pair of silver scissors. As a postscript to the desserts, a happy trolley comes rolling over, laden with lollipops, madeleines, jellied fruits, financiers and large apothecary jars filled with nougats and caramels.</p>
        <p>The recipients of this largesse take it as their due. At the moment, the crowd at Ducasse seems to be made up of world travelers used to feasting at Mr. Ducasse's top restaurants. There is none of the self-conscious display and neck-craning that I expected to see. Diners are not checking one another out. They make a dull group, to tell the truth -- well-heeled, deliberate feeders who will be dipping their beaks in vintage Champagne in London or Paris next week. The New York onslaught, in other words, is still poised. The scene has not yet materialized.</p>
        <p>My meal began with a plateful of paper-thin discs the size of poker chips. Our waiter announced them as rye-flour crisps topped either with Parmesan cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, citrus, or black pepper. These four taste themes, he explained, would be woven throughout the meal. That they were limp and greasy did not appear to be part of the thematic plan.</p>
        <p>The four-theme crackers reflected a highly conceptual bias at Ducasse. Black-and-white photographs on the walls, for example, express the four elements of earth, air, fire and water. The menu is florid and cryptic, divided into categories like ''aquatic,'' ''land,'' and ''vegetal'' (the Ducasse team is a little shaky on English). It takes a sharp eye to tease out the dividing line between appetizers and entrees, especially on the menus that do not show prices. (Ducasse stays with the traditional French practice of showing prices only to the host at the table.) And I puzzled over the italic typeface highlighting two dishes. The first was spaghettini with sauteed vegetables, crushed black truffles, Ligurian olive oil and basil; the second was lightly breaded veal sweetbreads doused in roasting juices.</p>
        <p>''These reflect Mr. Ducasse's two restaurants, in Paris and Monte Carlo,'' our waiter explained. The pasta and olive oil suggest the Italian influences that show up on the Monte Carlo menu. The sweetbreads allude to the richer, more classical Parisian menu. The wine list, too, has a rhetorical style, with a high-flying introductory paragraph in French and English, explaining the philosophy behind the three main categories: Continental, Mediterranean and oceanic.</p>
        <p>The meal included several highlights, beginning with foie gras poached in pepper court bouillon, a long, thick slab of almost comic proportions. I may be wrong, but I remember it as hanging over the plate.</p>
        <p>The veloute of spring peas also made an impression. Poured over a little heap of pea pods and radish greens, it came with crab fingers fried to a crisp blond finish and a mysterious silver implement with medical implications. The gleaming object stumped our table for at least 10 minutes before someone deduced that it was a set of pincers for picking up the crab fingers.</p>
        <p>Less inspiring was a pink block of wild salmon, served very simply on tile-shape potatoes, which was sandbagged by a viciously acidic peppered vinegar reduction. And for some reason, dishes kept showing up in front of the wrong diners.</p>
        <p>Our sommelier showed a take-charge style. When he saw a bad choice on the way, he did not hestitate to throw his body in front of it. ''What do you think about Chateau X,'' I asked, silently patting myself on the back for an ingenious pick. The sommelier had an answer. ''No,'' he said. That ended that.</p>
        <p>I am happy to get firm opinions firmly expressed. The world has no room for a wishy-washy sommelier, but I was a little dismayed to see him steer me immediately toward a $345 Burgundy.</p>
        <p>Ducasse boasts a waiter-to-diner ratio of nearly one to one (55 waiters to 65 diners), and you can feel it. The whizzing back and forth can be dizzying, the crush of carts more impressive than rush hour on the Van Wyck Expressway.</p>
        <p>But the real display of well-oiled teamwork took place in the brilliantly lighted and lavishly renovated kitchen, on display through a large square window. I got a good look at the show, all four hours of it, and it proceeded through distinct phases. At first, the scene resembled the operating room on ''E.R.,'' with the patient's prospects in serious doubt. With time, the mood seemed to lighten, although it was hard to tell, since never once, in all the time I observed the kitchen, did a chef ever betray even the hint of a smile.</p>
        <p>Toward the end, I watched them all scrubbing their saucepans and washing down their cutting surfaces. Around midnight, I expected to see the janitor come in with an electric floor polisher.</p>
        <p>Only one actor was missing from the drama, the man who would have made My Dinner With Alain the stuff of legend. That was Alain Ducasse himself. No one necessarily expects to see the great chef at his many restaurants -- he has 11 of them, after all, all over the planet. It's his little joke to say, from time to time, ''I am at all my restaurants all the time.''</p>
        <p>But you might think that less than two weeks into opening the most expensive restaurant Manhattan has ever seen -- the last restaurant, Mr. Ducasse has said, that will bear his name -- that he would be nervously pacing the quarterdeck, sniffing sauces and making sure that each $74 entree came out of the kitchen just so. But he apparently had other fish to fry, in this case the new Tokyo branch of Spoon, his Parisian diner. Or maybe he does not want to hear the screams of anguish when the checks arrive.</p>
        <p>I accepted mine with stoic calm. But then again, it wasn't coming out of my pocket. Taking pen in hand, I affixed my signature to a bill that totaled nearly $1,500 for four diners, tip not included. In one Olympic clean-and-jerk motion, I had broken all previous records by several hundred dollars. I felt the kind of mad exhilaration that criminals must feel when they've done something terribly, irrevocably wrong.</p>
        <p>As I picked up my complimentary craquelin on the way out, presented in a shiny royal-blue shopping bag, it occurred to me that I was back to square one. I had eaten at Ducasse. Fine. Now, how would I get back in? And would I ever lay eyes on Mr. Ducasse?</p>
