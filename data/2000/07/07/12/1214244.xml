        <p>Hoc Van Tran, left, the chef at Le Colonial on East 57th Street, has long wanted to share the sandwiches of his Vietnamese childhood with New Yorkers. He's doing that now at Nem, the restaurant's new food counter in the dining concourse of Grand Central Terminal.</p>
        <p>And what is his peanut-butter-and-jelly? A baguette slathered with butter and liver pate, then filled with shredded daikon, carrots, cucumber, cilantro and grilled marinated shrimp -- or pork, chicken or beef. Try that in Junior's lunchbox.</p>

        <p>Hoc Van Tran, left, the chef at Le Colonial on East 57th Street, has long wanted to share the sandwiches of his Vietnamese childhood with New Yorkers. He's doing that now at Nem, the restaurant's new food counter in the dining concourse of Grand Central Terminal.</p>
        <p>And what is his peanut-butter-and-jelly? A baguette slathered with butter and liver pate, then filled with shredded daikon, carrots, cucumber, cilantro and grilled marinated shrimp -- or pork, chicken or beef. Try that in Junior's lunchbox.</p>
        <p>Somehow, this odd French-Asian combination works, the smooth pate delivering a meaty richness that plays off the other ingredients. But you can ask that the pate be omitted, or that your sandwich be filled with simply grilled vegetables.</p>
        <p>In addition to the sandwiches ($5.50 to $6.50), there are soft salad rolls, crisp spring rolls, satays and salads, $2.95 to $7.50. Through July 25 there is a 20 percent discount.</p>
