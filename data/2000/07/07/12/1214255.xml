      <abstract>
        <p>Sarah Boxer's Critic's Notebook column expresses dislike for 500 fiberglass cows that have adorned sidewalks and parks in Manhattan, Stamford (Conn), and West Orange (NJ) since mid-June but will be auctioned off for charity in fall; photos (M)</p>

        <p>It's time to rain on the CowParade, the influx of painted bovine forms that has been choking the sidewalks and parks of New York City, Stamford, Conn., and West Orange, N.J., since mid-June. The 500 New York cows and their suburban cousins won't be leaving until fall, when they will be auctioned off for charity.</p>
        <p>COMPLAINT NO. 1:  These cows are un-American. Most American cows have their horns removed at birth. These cows, which have both udders and horns, are Swiss milking cows.</p>

        <p>It's time to rain on the CowParade, the influx of painted bovine forms that has been choking the sidewalks and parks of New York City, Stamford, Conn., and West Orange, N.J., since mid-June. The 500 New York cows and their suburban cousins won't be leaving until fall, when they will be auctioned off for charity.</p>
        <p>COMPLAINT NO. 1:  These cows are un-American. Most American cows have their horns removed at birth. These cows, which have both udders and horns, are Swiss milking cows.</p>
        <p>NO. 2:  Herd mentality. Zurich had the first cow parade, Cows on Parade, in 1998 (800 cows). Chicago got the second one, in 1999, after a shoe salesman from Chicago saw the Zurich cow parade and decided his city had to have a bovine event, too. (Chicago had 340 cows.) In 1999 CowParade Holdings, the for-profit corporation that owns licensing rights to CowParade and Cows on Parade, asked the New York City Parks Commissioner, Henry J. Stern, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani if New York wanted one. Sure, they said. So now New York is copying Chicago, a cow town, and Switzerland, a cow country.</p>
        <p>NO. 3:  Cowmerce. Each cow has been commissioned by a sponsor: a corporation, community organization, individual or business, including Hooters, Yahoo, The New York Times and a couple of steakhouses. For $7,500 the sponsor chooses an artist to paint its cow or selects a design that was submitted during an open call for artists earlier this year. After publicizing the event through arts organizations and news releases, CowParade received some 1,200 designs.</p>
        <p>NO. 4:  Bad cow disease. During the open call, three cows were rejected -- the Moonica Lewinsky cow, the Hasidic cow and a cow covered with butcher's marks and unbecoming remarks about butchery designed by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.</p>
        <p>NO. 5:  Moonotonous. Every cow is made of 100 pounds of fiberglass that has been molded into one of three poses: standing (head up), grazing (head down) and supine. All cows were made by Silvestri Inc. in Los Angeles, or by the Resource Factory in Sarasota, Fla., both manufacturers of fiberglass figures. The only acts left to the artists who are picked by the sponsors are painting, decorating and naming their cows. A cow floating on its back in an inner tube near the McGraw-Hill building looked like the work of an udder renegade.</p>
        <p>NO. 6:  Cowmeras. Too many tourists taking too many pictures.</p>
        <p>NO. 7:  Puns for names. Tutancowmon, Cowapatra, Cowlerina, Cowleidoscope, Cowmooter, Taxi Cow (used five times), Picowsso (three times), Moondrian (twice), Mootisse (once), MooMa (four times), Moo York (a dozen times), Moomaid, Moo Indigo, MooShoe and Herd on the Street (three times). Toss in the requisite Holy Cows (used twice) and Sacred Cows (seven times), and you get the picture. These cows are a public moosance.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 14, 2000, Friday  A Critic's Notebook article on Wednesday about fiberglass cows on exhibition in the New York area misidentified the building where Fresco, a cow reclining in an inner tube, is displayed. The building (formerly named for Exxon) is now known by its address, 1251 Avenue of the Americas. (The McGraw-Hill Building is at 1221 Avenue of the Americas.)</p>
