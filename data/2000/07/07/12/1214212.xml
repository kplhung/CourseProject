        <p>You are eagerly anticipating a trip to one of the world's great cities, but dreading the thought of looking like a tourist. What to do? Just leave those bright plaid Bermuda shorts at home, and follow these tips from Times correspondents.</p>
        <p>SINCE most real Parisians find a way to get out of their city in summer, just being here suggests that you're a tourist. Wearing sneakers doesn't help. But if you are willing to go off the beaten path a little, there are a few places where you might rub elbows with natives who have not managed to flee.</p>
        <p>Forget the Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de Vincennes. Watch a movie under the stars at the Parc de la Villette, which was built in 1987 and is actually the biggest green space in the city. On summer nights, you can rent a deck chair and a blanket for about $6 and get the feel of a drive-in without the cars. The films run the gamut from black-and-white classics to last year's blockbusters. Directors include Charlie Chaplin, Clint Eastwood, David Lynch, Joan Chen, Agnes Varda and Andrei Tarkovsky. The films are shown in their original languages with French subtitles. Films start July 15 and run nightly through Sept. 3. (Call 011-33-1-40-03-76-92 or check www.la-villette.com for program listings.)</p>

        <p>Or you could try in-line skating. The passion for that variety hangs on here, and there are two big organized outings every weekend. One is at night, for the kind of skater who speeds by you so close it takes your breath away. The other is for the kind more likely to be found clutching light poles. Friday evenings at 10, the experts get going from various locations and skate around Paris in a huge group for about two hours. Sunday afternoons at 2, the pole clutchers start near the Place de la Bastille and do the same. (Call 011-33-1-43-36-89-81 for information. Or check www.pari-roller.com or www.rollers-coquillages.org.)</p>
        <p>For a tamer Parisian pastime, go shopping on Sunday near the Place des Vosges in the Jewish quarter. Henry IV created the Place des Vosges, which was called the Place Royal in the early 1600's. But the neighborhood fell out of favor with the building of the Louvre and Versailles, and it was in much disrepair until the start of the 20th century, when it became the home for many Eastern European Jews, who settled and opened businesses there.</p>
        <p>While the rest of Paris pretty much shuts down on Sundays, this section bustles, its boutiques offering some of the trendiest fashions around.</p>
