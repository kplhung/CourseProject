        <p>Ask anyone in the direct response industry to describe e-commerce, and you're bound to get the same response: Internet retailing is simply another kind of direct marketing, not fundamentally different from the catalog and club businesses that have long made their money selling directly to consumers.</p>
        <p>But, at least until recently, many online sellers did not agree. When making advertising decisions, they viewed theirs as a business apart, a totally new endeavor with new rules or, more accurately, no rules. And with little direct marketing experience of their own, few paid attention to the lessons of an industry that long ago learned to choose its media carefully and to control the costs of acquiring customers.</p>

        <p>Ask anyone in the direct response industry to describe e-commerce, and you're bound to get the same response: Internet retailing is simply another kind of direct marketing, not fundamentally different from the catalog and club businesses that have long made their money selling directly to consumers.</p>
        <p>But, at least until recently, many online sellers did not agree. When making advertising decisions, they viewed theirs as a business apart, a totally new endeavor with new rules or, more accurately, no rules. And with little direct marketing experience of their own, few paid attention to the lessons of an industry that long ago learned to choose its media carefully and to control the costs of acquiring customers.</p>
        <p>''Call it naivete or Silicon Valley arrogance,'' said Jim Nail, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., who specializes in online marketing and advertising. Either way, the result was the same: online retailers spent lavishly on general advertising, often paying full price for print and broadcast ads while eschewing cheaper and often more effective direct response advertising. Their focus was on ''branding,'' and on the hope that getting themselves known would be enough to garner customers and win the good will of Wall Street.</p>
        <p>But branding is not sufficient by itself to generate sales, Mr. Nail said: ''All it does is implant an idea in the consumer's head.'' To get actual customers, he said, ''you have to target your advertising to high-quality prospects, measure the value of your customers and constantly use your data to fine-tune your strategy.'' In short, ''you need direct marketing.''</p>
        <p>Of course, it is hardly surprising that this is the view of H. Robert Wientzen, president of the Direct Marketing Association. He is not surprised that branding alone has yielded e-tailers too few customers at too high a cost. Indeed, he and other direct marketing industry members used to scratch their heads, he said, and wonder just how long such a mistaken strategy could last.</p>
        <p>Not very long, as it happens. The Internet bubble has burst. Wall Street is less interested in branding than in bottom-line profitability, the kind that few online retailers can demonstrate. Many Internet sellers are watching their colleagues and competitors go belly-up, and are realizing that they, too, may soon be in trouble. And they are turning to direct marketers -- and direct response agencies -- for help, said Robert Johnston, president of the New York eCommerce Association, an industry trade group whose members include software companies, Internet service providers and a number of Internet retailers.</p>
        <p>''For e-tailers,'' he said, ''the trend of the future is direct marketing.''</p>
        <p>''Basically, I think that what the Internet has done is that it has validated direct marketing,'' said Wendy Riches, president of D'Arcy Marketing Communications Group, a division of B Com3  Group. Her agency is among those that have recently seen a number of new e-tailer clients. So has MediaCom Digital, a division of Grey Global Group, according to its president, Harvey Goldhersz. And the trend is not limited to large shops; smaller boutique agencies like Iris Shokoff Associates, a direct media buyer, are also benefiting.</p>
        <p>What do they offer their new clients? ''Accountability,'' Mr. Goldhersz said. Ms. Shokoff agreed. ''Dot-coms need to find out just who is buying from them so they can target those people again,'' she said. ''And they need to figure a way to get to new people, cheaply and efficiently, by using media wisely and by negotiating rates.''</p>
        <p>In the past, many Internet retailers did none of this. Indeed, if they measured at all, they limited their observations to what they could see online, generally doing little more than counting impressions -- that is, the number of people who saw their banners -- and clicks on a given site.</p>
        <p>Hardly a coherent strategy, Ms. Riches scoffed. ''Clicks alone mean nothing,'' she said. ''It's not enough to bring a client to a Web site, you've got to get them to buy.''</p>
        <p>How badly were the e-retailers doing? Well, Ms. Shokoff said that she heard tales of Internet retailers spending as much as $5 to $50 to acquire each sale, even though direct marketers generally consider $10 or less a customer to be appropriate under most circumstances, according to Mr. Wientzen of the Direct Marketing Association. He said that he had heard of worse numbers, too, of Internet companies paying customer acquisition costs anywhere from $80 to $400 a customer. They would even brag of customer bases of perhaps 100,000, he added, a figure traditional direct marketers -- many of whom count their customers in the millions -- would generally consider to be unprofitably low.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shokoff, Ms. Riches and Mr. Goldhersz all said that they could do better. They have techniques of measurement, or metrics, media buying resources and research capabilities that the Internet sellers do not, they said, not to mention years of experience in the field. But none would name specific Internet clients or give specific examples of how they were helping them, for fear of offending those that might be embarrassed by their prior missteps.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Goldhersz did allow that his clients included companies like the Vitamin Shoppe and GoAmerica, a wireless Internet service provider. And he said that one of his clients -- not necessarily one of the two -- had suffered rather acutely from its ignorance of direct marketing before turning to his agency.</p>
        <p>''They spent $14 or $15 million in the last quarter of last year, all of it on branding,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''And nothing happened.''</p>
