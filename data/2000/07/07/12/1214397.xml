        <p>Prosecutors searched the offices of Media-Most, the nation's largest private media conglomerate, today for the second time in two months, stepping up a criminal investigation that skeptics call an effort to silence one of the Kremlin's few prominent critics.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors also sought documents from Gazprom, the huge state-run natural gas monopoly, which is Media-Most's biggest financial supporter, apparently as part of a continuing inquiry into the media company's finances.</p>
        <p>The raids took place one month after the prosecutors briefly imprisoned the conglomerate's owner, Vladimir A. Gusinsky, in connection with the same inquiry, which is said to involve an allegation of financial impropriety in his purchase of a television station from the government.</p>
        <p>They followed by days a series of confrontations between Media-Most and the government, perhaps capped by a veiled reference to Mr. Gusinsky in a ''state of the nation'' speech delivered on Saturday by President Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
        <p>In that speech Mr. Putin said unrestricted freedom of the press was essential to Russian democracy. But he added that the main threat came not from the government, but from tycoons who wielded their newspapers and television stations against each other and, at times, the state.</p>
        <p>A few other tycoons have media holdings. But Mr. Gusinsky's company is the only media conglomerate to come under legal and financial pressure from the government.</p>
        <p>Today, agents of the Russian prosecutor general and the Federal Security Service -- the heir to the K.G.B.'s domestic intelligence activities -- served search warrants at the headquarters of Media-Most and the offices of NTV, a subsidiary that runs the nation's only independent broadcast network.</p>
        <p>They carted away a sheaf of financial documents from the headquarters, Media-Most officials later said, but took only a list of shareholders from the NTV office.</p>
        <p>Two months ago, shotgun-toting prosecutors and tax police officers appeared at Media-Most headquarters in ski masks and camouflage, staging a telegenic raid and search that many critics then saw as a warning to Mr. Gusinsky to tone down his attacks on Kremlin policies including the war in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor general's office said today that the latest seizures were a routine part of its inquiry, which apparently centers on Mr. Gusinsky's purchase of a St. Petersburg television station in 1997.</p>
        <p>The deputy prosecutor general who is leading the inquiry, Vasily Kolmogorov, said in a letter to Parliament last week that Mr. Gusinsky had swindled the government out of at least $10 million in the deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky has vigorously denied that, and has refused to answer questions in what he calls a sham inquiry. In today's search, investigators apparently focused on Media-Most's relations with Gazprom.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Moscow city prosecutors announced that they had arrested a reporter for a prominent NTV program on charges of drug smuggling. NTV officials denied any connection to the suspect.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, the best-known NTV commentator, Yevgeny Kiselyov, delivered a broadside against Mr. Putin, accusing the president of harboring imperial ambitions.</p>
