        <p>As the Camp David summit meeting got under way today, Vered Melki stood on a curbside near the residence of Prime Minister Ehud Barak and held up a hand-lettered sign that said, ''Go -- bring us peace.''</p>
        <p>She was one of about 1,500 demonstrators who turned out for a rally in support of the embattled prime minister, whose governing coalition and parliamentary majority crumbled this week, but who insists he still has the popular backing of the Israelis who elected him.</p>
        <p>''I have the feeling that this is the moment of truth, and after all the politics recently, I wanted Barak to see that there are people behind him and that he's not alone,'' Ms. Melki said.</p>
        <p>The summit meeting is raising the political temperature on the streets here. The rally this evening was one of a series of demonstrations by both supporters and opponents of Mr. Barak and his peace efforts.</p>
        <p>Near Mr. Barak's residence this evening, motorists could choose from competing bumper stickers handed out by teenagers. One said: ''The majority has decided: peace.'' Another warned: ''Barak is losing the country.''</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Jewish settlers and their supporters on the political right, alarmed by the prospect of a handover of land they live on to the Palestinians, have dominated, holding protests and posting signs that proclaim: ''Uprooting settlements tears apart the nation,'' and ''You don't abandon your brothers.''</p>
        <p>Their activities -- which included a prayer meeting today at the Western Wall and the start of a hunger strike by founders of the settlement movement -- are expected to climax in a mass demonstration on Sunday night in Tel Aviv.</p>
        <p>Peace advocates, fearing that Mr. Barak might be exposed to the kind of incendiary protests that preceded the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, have vowed to respond, starting with the rally tonight.</p>
        <p>''The idea is to have a presence on the street, to counter the impression that the public is against the peace process, which is simply not true,'' said Galia Golan of the Peace Now movement.</p>
        <p>Yet the turnout at the pro-Barak demonstration tonight was lower than expected by organizers. This was despite persistent calls in the media in recent days by prominent liberal writers, among them Amos Oz, for an outpouring of public support for the prime minister.</p>
        <p>Many people who back the peace effort were too complacent, said Moshe Hay, who came to the rally from Kibbutz Dvir. ''They figure that Barak will do the job,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There seems to be a greater sense of urgency in the rightist camp, especially among settlers afraid they may lose their homes.</p>
        <p>On the fringes of the peace rally tonight, a group of schoolchildren brought in from the West Bank settlement of Rimonim held up signs and chanted slogans.</p>
        <p>''We want peace, but not at our expense,'' said 12-year-old Dotan Cohen. ''Barak is selling us out.''</p>
        <p>A more ominous tone was struck by a handful of placard holders from the banned extreme rightist party Kach, who sang, ''He's a traitor,'' an epithet they had hurled at Mr. Rabin.</p>
        <p>At the pro-Barak rally, Mr. Rabin's daughter, Dalia Rabin, a member of Parliament, promised that this time such slogans would not go unanswered.</p>
        <p>''The street will feel, the street will know, the street will see who the real majority is,'' she said, ''and it is no longer silent.''</p>
