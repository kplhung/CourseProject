        <p>Drawing on New York City's wealth of literary talent, Barnard College is starting a creative writing program this fall that will use noted authors as teachers. JHUMPA LAHIRI, a Barnard graduate who won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction this year with ''Interpreter of Maladies,'' is already lined up. Two novelists on Barnard's faculty, CARYL PHILLIPS, author of ''Crossing the River'' and MARY GORDON, above, author of ''The Rest of Life,'' will head the program.</p>

        <p>Barnard Expands Creative Writing Program</p>
        <p>Drawing on New York City's wealth of literary talent, Barnard College is starting a creative writing program this fall that will use noted authors as teachers. JHUMPA LAHIRI, a Barnard graduate who won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction this year with ''Interpreter of Maladies,'' is already lined up.

        <p>CUNY Chairman to Debate Core Curriculum</p>
        <p>What should students at the City University of New York learn? HERMAN BADILLO, CUNY's chairman, will debate that subject with BERNARD SOHMER, the chairman of the CUNY faculty senate, at a Manhattan Institute forum at the Roosevelt Hotel tonight. Mr. Badillo favors a structured core curriculum with a required course in American history. Dr. Sohmer will argue that a framework of required courses may be appropriate, but that the choice should be made by the faculty at each college, not the university trustees. The public is invited but must register in advance with the Manhattan Institute at (212) 599-7000.</p>
        <p>Wireless Study Aid Donated to Students</p>
        <p>Help is just a phone call away for students in District 5 in Harlem who are studying for the fourth and eighth grade state reading and math tests at the end of the summer. They can call teachers using cell phones donated by Sprint PCS to get help with homework and for questions about the exams. SEAN DAVENPORT, the special assistant to THELMA B. BAXTER, the district superintendent, will answer questions about the program at (212) 769-7606.</p>
        <p>From Computer Trainees to Network Specialists</p>
        <p>Seventeen students, some of whom had been cab drivers and disc jockeys, graduated yesterday from a six-month computer training program at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. The program, which was financed by a $379,000 federal grant and also  sponsored by Cisco Systems, was geared toward residents of low-income areas of the Bronx and upper Manhattan. Outside the classroom, the students, who were from 18 to 46 years old, were interns at companies like Salomon Smith Barney, Earthweb.com and Hotjobs.com.</p>
        <p>Nine of the graduates have already passed a test to become certified network program specialists. CARLOS FRAGA, a Cuban-born father of two who had a high school education before the program, is to start a $57,000-a-year job at Chase Securities in Manhattan today.</p>
        <p>Three Promoted to Superintendent in Brooklyn</p>
        <p>Two former principals and a deputy superintendent in Brooklyn have become school district superintendents. In District 14 in Williamsburg, PATRICIA SYNAN, the former principal at Public School 31, replaced ROBERT SHEEDY as interim superintendent. In District 19 in East New York, VICTOR RODRIQUEZ, former principal of Intermediate School 171, became acting superintendent, replacing JOAN E. MAHON-POWELL, who was promoted from district superintendent to a senior position in the Chancellor's Office. And in District 21 in Gravesend and Coney Island, ETHYL TUCKER, former deputy superintendent, replaced DONALD WEBER, who retired.</p>
