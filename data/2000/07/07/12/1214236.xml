        <p>New Rosa Mexicano</p>
        <p>Before you sip that tequila, check out the two-story wall of water that dominates David Rockwell's vibrant decor at the new Rosa Mexicano  West, 51 Columbus Avenue (62nd Street). The water spills past hundreds of little diver statues attached to the mosaic-tile wall and into a shallow pool. The nearly 200-seat restaurant on two floors is a much grander place than the original founded by Josefina Howard on First Avenue. The menu by Sergio Remolina combines tradition and invention: tuna marinated in bitter orange juice; prawns with garlic, parsley and black rice; and chilies rellenos stuffed with Tuscan caciotta cheese.</p>

        <p>Vive Gaby!</p>
        <p>As befits a brasserie in a French hotel, Gaby, in the Sofitel at 45 West 44th Street, will open with the hotel on Bastille Day, Friday.</p>
        <p>Though Gaby can be entered through the hotel lobby, it has its own entrance at 44 West 45th Street. Marble, mirrors and brass have been lavished on the vaguely Art Deco room, which is decorated with paintings of Gaby, a French model and actress who played the New York stage in the 1920's. The menu by Eric Fraudeau offers classic brasserie fare. On Friday evening there will be entertainment until 10:30 p.m., and a free bottle of Champagne will be given to each couple until 10 p.m.</p>
