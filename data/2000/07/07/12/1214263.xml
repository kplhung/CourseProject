        <p>I DUG into my first real French steak, pan-seared, at a noisy, smoke-filled brasserie near Pigalle about 20 years ago. It was onglet, and I was immediately struck by its ropy, not-too-tender but not-too-tough texture and its strong, almost kidneyish flavor.

        <p>Today onglet is better known as hanger steak in New York, and it is so common it turns up in restaurants beyond French brasseries, and even in some meat markets.

        <p>I DUG into my first real French steak, pan-seared, at a noisy, smoke-filled brasserie near Pigalle about 20 years ago. It was onglet, and I was immediately struck by its ropy, not-too-tender but not-too-tough texture and its strong, almost kidneyish flavor. This was not your generic slab of sirloin or rib-eye or pallid filet mignon. This was a cut of meat I'd never seen before. Strange, exciting, even a little scary. This, I thought, was eating.</p>
        <p>Today onglet is better known as hanger steak in New York, and it is so common it turns up in restaurants beyond French brasseries, and even in some meat markets. But the French steaks served alongside the frites can still be a mystery to most Americans, and it's not the meat but the cut that mystifies. These aren't simple sirloins or porterhouses or T-bones, and the differences are not just a matter of translation. For all their flavor, these steaks demand more of butcher and buyer alike.</p>
        <p>What's good -- what's great -- about French cuisine stems from its guiding principles, and no principle is more firmly ingrained in the minds and souls of French-trained chefs than the idea that one must ''use everything.'' Use what's available. Use it to its best effect. And make the most money you can from it -- every scrap of shank, shoulder and jowl.</p>
        <p>Back in the early days, when the meat supply was often erratic and refrigeration was at a minimum, frugal butchers had to make some shrewd moves to make a profit off a side of beef. They worked hard, often with the precision of desperate and money-hungry neurologists, rooting around with their knives, searching for gold deep inside the less-prized and less-expensive sections of carcass.</p>
        <p>At Les Halles in New York, where I'm the chef, I have the luxury of working with Hubert Marie, a traditionally trained French butcher. He knows where and how to dig for this stuff, and he's initiated me into the arcane pleasures of French-cut beef.</p>
        <p>The French, though they age every other thing they eat -- game, cheese, wine, their whole country a wonderland of noble rot -- do not, inexplicably, age their beef much: only three to five days, as opposed to the three to five weeks favored by Americans.</p>
        <p>French cattle are fed mostly on grass and, unlike their grain-fed counterparts in the United States, are often bred to produce both milk and meat. And not to be unkind but, with the notable exception of Charolais beef, the French meat is generally tougher, less marbled with fat, and less tasty when finally cut up, cooked and dropped in portions onto dinner plates. I get the best of both worlds: plump, well-marbled Black Angus beef from the American heartland, and the knife skills and enterprising mind of a French butcher.</p>
        <p>After the most expensive cuts -- tenderloin (filet de boeuf), rib steaks (entrecotes) and sirloin (faux filet) -- were gone, sold to their wealthier customers, French butchers found other more-difficult-to-remove pieces: small, frequently single-portion cuts with mysterious names like la poire (the pear) and la fausse-araignee (the spider).</p>
        <p>Of these odd cuts, there are a few actually available to Americans: paleron, a piece of shoulder clod, most often used for braising, though it yields excellent steaks for searing and grilling; pave, or filet de romsteck, a sort of poor man's filet mignon; the awesome onglet; and the bavette d'aloyau, the more tender little brother of flank steak.</p>
        <p>A regular customer unhappy about not being able to afford the aristocratic (but relatively flavorless) delights of filet mignon could comfort herself with the knowledge that the hand-size flap of leg or shoulder, which the butcher ceremoniously wrapped in brown paper, was often the only such cut on the entire side of beef: a rare, much-sought-after treat that would, once spirited back home, be unavailable to that nasty Madame Dupont next door.</p>
        <p>Onglet was for years known in America as the butcher's tenderloin, a single-strip piece of gamy, unattractive beef situated between the kidneys. Unprotected by bone or fat it quickly became dark and unsalable to American customers for whom all steak was rosy sirloin or T-bone, so the butcher would keep that piece for himself. For the French, though, this cut was a rare pleasure -- because of its exposed location, it comes in contact with the air and begins aging almost immediately after the animal is slaughtered, and so it is more flavorful.</p>
        <p>The industrious Hubert is a master at work on a romsteck -- called a top butt in America. For steak frites, he cuts and slices the thin, chewy, powerful-tasting leg meat that stands up so well to the freshly cracked black pepper I adore. For London broil, he doesn't just whack the big hump of beef straight across -- fat, connective tissue, nerve and all -- as his American comrades do; he seams and cuts, removing the outer flap, a piece that yields a few steaks and some grinding meat. Then he cuts away all the fat and connective tissue from the large coeur de romsteck, which is also used for steak frites, and then skillfully cuts to the heart of the matter: the elusive filet de romsteck, a cylindrical column of beef about a foot long, a tasty, fairly tender and completely trimmed hunk that resembles filet mignon. It's typically cut like a filet and called pave, and used for steak au poivre.</p>
        <p>Those old-school French guys worked hard at the butcher block and came up with simple, delicious ways to cook some of these hard-won cuts -- again, using what was cheap, what was leftover, what was around.</p>
        <p>My boss, who hails from the Bordeaux region, gets misty-eyed when he talks about grilling onglet ''en sarment'' -- over dried grapevine twigs. Next time you take one of those vineyard tours on Long Island, maybe you can ask for some of their trash. (Just make sure to scoop up a lot of the dried vines, or you'll end up buying them in sexy little ribbon-tied bundles at some gourmet shop for 20 bucks a clip.)</p>
        <p>Onglet a l'echalote inspires similar wistful reverie among my French cronies and co-workers: simply grill a piece of seasoned hanger steak (this preparation is good for flank steak, too, though really good if you can get a French butcher to cut you a bavette d'aloyau), remove it from the flame just short of desired doneness, and while it's still sizzling hot, cover one side with chopped or finely diced shallots and let it sit for five minutes. The meat will rest -- which is always a good idea -- and the raw shallots will sweat slightly -- seeming to cook on the hot beef, but not really.</p>
        <p>Eat with plenty of vin ordinaire -- and of course, frites. (If you can get some kidney fat off your butcher to fry those spuds, you are really living the good life.)</p>
        <p>Pave, the filet de romsteck, is a cut that one of the few French butchers in town might actually be able to sell you now and again -- especially if you call ahead. And again, the more humble pieces of leg and shoulder work particularly well with pepper: just dredge in cracked peppercorns, sear in a hot, oiled saute pan to desired doneness (the thick pave can be finished in the oven if necessary), pour off excess grease and oil from the pan and deglaze with a tablespoon or two of brandy. Do not flame -- no matter how much fun it is.</p>
        <p>As the brandy reduces, and all that good stuff releases from the pan, add a few ounces of demiglace (you can buy it frozen if you must), a pinch more of crushed black pepper, some sea salt, and reduce a little more. At the very end, gently swirl in a heart-clogging hunk of butter until the sauce becomes a creamy emulsion. Pour over the steak, and serve with frites (of course), maybe a little salad of local greens, and a thick chunk of country bread.</p>
        <p>At Les Halles, we serve a red wine shallot sauce with our onglet. Slowly saute two chopped shallots in a little oil until they look clear. Add about half a cup of red wine and reduce by about two-thirds, then add about a cup of demiglace, a sprig of fresh thyme and a bay leaf, and cook until reduced by half.</p>
        <p>When the sauce is fairly thick, opaque and no longer tastes winy, add a chopped shallot. Simmer a few moments more, then jack the sauce with a tiny amount of balsamic or good-quality aged red wine vinegar. Season with black pepper and sea salt, and serve, either poured over the steak or on the side.</p>
        <p>The combination of strong-tasting beef and sweet-and-ever-so-slightly-sour sauce should have you whistling horrible French pop tunes and reconsidering Jerry Lewis in no time at all.</p>
