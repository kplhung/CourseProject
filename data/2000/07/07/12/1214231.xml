        <p>IF you scoff at the notion that pairing particular wines and foods can create magic, here is a suggestion: get some good marinated Spanish olives and a bottle of dry fino or manzanilla sherry. Chill the sherry well, pour a small glass and taste it with the olives, then see if you don't agree that, like Bogart and Bacall, the two belong together.</p>
        <p>It's hard to find a beverage less understood and more undervalued than sherry. The image of a treacly brown fluid brought out at academic teas could not be further from the truth. In fact, top-quality dry sherries are probably the cheapest great wines you are likely to find.</p>

        <p>IF you scoff at the notion that pairing particular wines and foods can create magic, here is a suggestion: get some good marinated Spanish olives and a bottle of dry fino or manzanilla sherry. Chill the sherry well, pour a small glass and taste it with the olives, then see if you don't agree that, like Bogart and Bacall, the two belong together.</p>
        <p>It's hard to find a beverage less understood and more undervalued than sherry. The image of a treacly brown fluid brought out at academic teas could not be further from the truth. In fact, top-quality dry sherries are probably the cheapest great wines you are likely to find.</p>
        <p>Authentic sherries come only from an area near the Atlantic coast in Andalusia in southwestern Spain, bounded by the towns of Jerez de la Frontera, Cadiz and Sanlucar de Barrameda.  Sherry comes in two types, fino and oloroso. The difference depends on a strain of yeast called flor, which develops only on finos. It gives finos a tangy quality and prevents them from oxidizing, so they retain their freshness and pale color. Olorosos are darker, richer, higher in alcohol and more expensive because they are aged longer.</p>
        <p>Finos are the focus here, and their styles and flavors can vary tremendously. Those simply labeled fino are light and bone-dry with complex aromas that can range from almonds to an attractive petroleum quality. Manzanilla, a type of fino made only in the seaside town of Sanlucar, is more delicate and often has a salty quality. Amontillados are finos that have been aged, becoming darker, softer and nuttier.</p>
        <p>All sherries are blends, and so are not vintage wines. When buying a fino or manzanilla, ask for the freshest bottle. Chill it and drink it soon. Your olives will thank you; so might your shellfish, your chicken, your ham.</p>
