        <p>My husband, Robert Morgenthau, and I thought it would be challenging to begin our marriage by circumnavigating the vast state of New York in his 32-foot wooden fishing boat. That was 20 years ago, and even then this boat, with its cabin in which  only one person can comfortably stand (and touch the head, or toilet, the narrow bunks and the little fridge without moving an inch), was considered an antique. But The Souvenir took us through hundreds of miles of waterways, from the Erie Canal to the Oswego Canal, across Lake Ontario, through the Thousand Islands of Canada and back down the Richelieu Canal to Lake Champlain and the Champlain Canal back down to the Hudson. It was two weeks of floating through Theodore Dreiser country.</p>
        <p>Historic revolutionary forts, James Fenimore Cooper's home, Victorian lighthouses as elaborate castles, gingerbread mansions and the ever-changing riverbank life, cows and dreamers, cables pulling doddering ferries from bank to bank, a woman under the dipping willows with a minnow pail balanced on her stomach.</p>
        <p>Best fun of all was the constant ''locking in.'' A lock is like a great big bathtub that raises or lowers a boat with a sharp change in the elevation of the terrain. We entered our first big one in a cracking thunderstorm. The huge iron doors slammed behind us as we came alongside a slimy green stone wall, and threw our line over the lowest rung. Water swirled in, along with dead fish and mosquitoes, and as a current raised us, it took everything we had to hold fast to the line and loop it from rung to rung as the wind pounded the boat against the wall and a toothless lockkeeper grinned at us greenhorns from his perch at the top. Then, suddenly, it was as though Dante had taken us from Inferno to Paradise as we reached the top to see balls of mist rolling off the towpath, green pastures and the last of the wind gently batting pink roses on the lockhouse's vines.</p>
        <p>We fell in love with the ordinary rhythm of our life. There was so much to do, we had little time to think: check the engine; fill the pumps; get diesel oil and ice; run to bow chock with stern line, run to stern with bow line; lasso that bollard; pump alcohol into the stove, extinguish fire that comes from pumping too much alcohol into stove, nurse gash on shin; apply salve to blister; collapse at end of day with a bottle of Chateau Latour (opened with an ice pick) and watch the best sunsets of your life.</p>
        <p>Of course, when confined to 100 square feet, even two newlyweds can find conflicts. In particular, a basic disagreement smoldered over whether the engine box should be respected as a dining table, most particularly at mealtime, when it certainly ought not to be opened and we would have to deposit the oily bilge pump onto a freshly washed tablecloth.</p>
        <p>By the time we neared the 23rd Street pier in Manhattan, though, we felt great. A wind came up and arching waves deposited spray on every corner of the deck, but we bounced along unthwarted. ''After navigating 1,100  miles, 60 locks, four canals, four lakes, three rivers and two countries,'' said Bob, shaking out a sodden chart, ''42nd Street in August will be easy.''</p>
