        <p>CARTER-Pauline. Either we have squirrels in the attic, or you've got to stop walking around all night. It's been a year since you sat with me at the kitchen table while I had my Friday night salad, since we've gone for Saturday afternoon lunch at the Diner, since we've gone for Sunday night dinner at Scotto's, since you've listened to me play the piano, since I've seen you smile, since I've heard you laugh. Your tulips came up in May. I hung your geraniums on the terrace, put the pillows on your swing and planted your garden for your birthday. The house is just not the same without you. I miss you dearly. With all my love, Larry.</p>
