        <p>How do you organize a list of more than 500 wines? By color? Done. By type of grape? Done. Dan Perlman, the wine director of AZ, a new Asian-fusion restaurant at 21 West 17th Street, consulted an ancient Chinese guide, the I Ching, or Book of Changes, to help sort things out.</p>
        <p>The I Ching has symbols, or trigrams, made of solid or broken horizontal lines, representing qualities of nature that are supposed to govern daily life.</p>

        <p>How do you organize a list of more than 500 wines? By color? Done. By type of grape? Done. Dan Perlman, the wine director of AZ, a new Asian-fusion restaurant at 21 West 17th Street, consulted an ancient Chinese guide, the I Ching, or Book of Changes, to help sort things out.</p>
        <p>The I Ching has symbols, or trigrams, made of solid or broken horizontal lines, representing qualities of nature that are supposed to govern daily life.</p>
        <p>In his leather-bound book, Mr. Perlman's silky soft reds, like pinot noir, are listed under the sensual mist symbol, full-bodied merlots have the balanced mountain symbol and some sparkling wines are grouped with the subtle wind symbol. And what about oddball grapes like negroamaro, baga and plavac mali? They get the thunder sign, for experimentation.</p>
        <p>The I Ching is also used to interpret the future. Forget tea leaves. Perhaps that sediment in the bottom of the glass might be worth a second look.</p>
