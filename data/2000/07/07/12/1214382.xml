        <p>In the verdant hills of Maryland, far from the arid land that is the object of their bitter dispute, the Israeli and Palestinian leaders began a summit meeting at Camp David today with the far-reaching -- most think improbable -- goal of ending their 52-year-old conflict.</p>
        <p>On the first day of an open-ended, tightly secluded meeting, President Clinton ushered the leaders into the presidential retreat, which is about six miles from here. He hopes that the chemistry of the place and the moment can induce a spirit of ''principled compromise'' that yields a substantive peace agreement.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, the only one of the three leaders who spoke publicly today, talked in idealistic tones of securing a ''just and enduring end'' to the conflict and of the ''gift of peace'' that the leaders could give their children.</p>
        <p>But officials on all sides acknowledge that a good, partial agreement would represent a significant accomplishment and may be the only realistic end to this fluidly scheduled, seat-of-the-pants-style meeting.</p>
        <p>''Of course, there is no guarantee of success,'' President Clinton said at the White House before flying to Camp David. ''But not to try is to guarantee failure.''</p>
        <p>Arriving for their opening three-way meeting this afternoon, Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, did a smiley little dance at the entrance to the Laurel Cabin at Camp David. It was a stubborn jig as each sidestepped to try to make the other enter first into the crucible of decision making.</p>
        <p>In the end, with Mr. Barak's hand on his elbow, Mr. Arafat crossed the threshold one beat ahead of the Israeli prime minister, who constantly says that ''it takes to two to tango'' for peacemaking to work.</p>
        <p>The lighthearted but highly principled moment offered a glimpse at the steely determination with which each Middle East leader is approaching the negotiating table, a rectangular one, apparently, at which 21 American, Israeli and Palestinian delegates sat today to open their talks. (Another 13 sat behind them.) But it was the only glimpse offered into what the Americans, imposing a news blackout, are trying to make an airtight environment safe from the pressures of public scrutiny.</p>
        <p>''The atmosphere is good, and the mood is serious,'' Joe Lockhart,  President Clinton's spokesman, said. And that is about all he said.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials said tonight that they would soon ''resolve'' their dispute with the Clinton administration over their $250 million contract to sell the Phalcon advanced radar system to the Chinese. But Israel has been reluctant to cancel the deal, which has soured relations between Israel and many of its backers on Capitol Hill, and it is unclear what kind of resolution they intend -- canceling, altering or postponing the deal -- and whether they are linking it to progress at the summit meeting.</p>
        <p>Under leafy boughs and in cabins named for trees, the Israelis and the Palestinians were transported far from the cramped, dusty and conflicted Middle East into expansive, humid and relatively carefree suburban America.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak was an ocean away from the political crisis that crippled his government, and Mr. Arafat far from the refugees who marched today in the West Bank to demand that he not sell them out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak was placed in the Dogwood Cabin, where Anwar Sadat stayed 22 years ago when the successful summit meeting between Egypt and Israel opened to complete public skepticism about what it could accomplish. Mr. Arafat was given the Birch Cabin that Prime Minister Menachem Begin occupied then, at the start of the Israeli-Arab peace effort that has built to a crucial moment this week.</p>
        <p>Publicly, in what seemed a neon illustration of why the Americans are imposing the news blackout, the senior negotiators for the two sides have expressed contrasting views of the possibilities of achievement.  Shlomo Ben Ami, the Israeli internal security minister, said on Monday that he felt confident that an agreement could be reached. Abu Ala, speaker of the Palestinian legislature, said he did not comprehend how Mr. Ben Ami could speak with such confidence.</p>
        <p>''The Palestinian position will never change,'' Mr. Abu Ala said in an interview with the Voice of Palestine. ''And the Israeli position has its well-known 'no's. So how can the minister talk about an agreement?''</p>
        <p>Speaking at a news conference in Washington, Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian legislator who is serving as a spokeswoman for the delegation despite her frequent strident criticism of Mr. Arafat, said the delegation was ''extremely realistic.''</p>
        <p>''I don't expect to see miraculous, substantive breakthroughs,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Israeli television reported tonight that the Americans want all the thorny issues -- borders, Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Palestinian statehood, water, the fate of the Palestinian refugees and the future status of Jerusalem -- to be discussed at the talks.</p>
        <p>This would put Jerusalem on the formal negotiating table for the first time in the seven years since the Israelis and the Palestinians have been talking. Many think that each side's intractable claims on the holy city make the issue irresolvable, although Israeli television reported that Mr. Barak was prepared to compromise on all issues, including Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>American officials said that Mr. Barak has indicated in his public and private statements that he must return to Israel with some kind of a deal if he hopes to hold his government together.</p>
        <p>However, Mr. Clinton, who was to spend the night at Camp David with the two leaders, is unlikely to offer specific proposals for a few days, hoping instead to spend the first sessions airing out the issues.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said they expect the ''crunch days'' for negotiators to be next Monday and Tuesday, ahead of Mr. Clinton's scheduled departure next Wednesday for Okinawa and a meeting with leaders of the leading industrial nations.</p>
        <p>Before arriving in the United States early this morning, a senior Israeli official told Israeli reporters aboard Mr. Barak's plane that the prime minister was unruffled by the defection of three rightist parties from his coalition and a no-confidence motion that he barely passed. The official, trying to put a positive spin on a devastating event, said that Mr. Barak considered it an accomplishment that the parties had stayed in his government for a year.</p>
        <p>He also said that Mr. Barak believed that his position at the summit meeting would be strengthened by the fact that he had not spent the last year at the helm of a narrow, dovish government. But right-wing protesters in Israel did not seem to be granting him any grace because he had tried and failed to forge an alliance with some of their leaders.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials worried quietly that Americans and Israelis would pressure them into making unwanted concessions because of Mr. Barak's political problems, referring to frequent mention of the idea that Mr. Barak represented the best peace partner they could hope for.</p>
        <p>Rallying behind the prime minister, some 28 retired Israeli generals ran a newspaper advertisement today that said: ''Go in peace Ehud Barak, there is no one more suited to the task than you. Go in peace, accompanied by our prayer that you will find the formula that will bring about an end to the historic conflict between us and the Palestinians.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, preparing for a possible failure of the summit meeting and an outbreak of Palestinian violence, Mr. Barak made it known that he had appointed Ephraim Sneh, the deputy defense minister, to coordinate a defensive strategy. Israeli Channel Two television showed footage of Israeli positions in the West Bank that have recently been fortified and sandbagged in preparation for firefights.</p>
