        <p>IF you find yourself hankering to travel with Fido, Tweety or whatever you have dubbed your pet, and you're feeling apologetic about your obsessive attachment, drop the angst. You have lots of company.</p>
        <p>Roughly 60 million American households now have pets -- a jump of 18 percent since 1990, according to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association. Dogs are the most popular: 4 of 10 households have at least one.

And two-thirds of dog owners take the animals with them when they travel, says the American Animal Hospital Association.</p>

        <p>IF you find yourself hankering to travel with Fido, Tweety or whatever you have dubbed your pet, and you're feeling apologetic about your obsessive attachment, drop the angst. You have lots of company.</p>
        <p>Roughly 60 million American households now have pets -- a jump of 18 percent since 1990, according to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association. Dogs are the most popular: 4 of 10 households have at least one. Cats are second, in 32 percent of American households, followed far down the scale by fish (10 percent), birds (6 percent), small animals (4 percent) and reptiles (3 percent). And two-thirds of dog owners take the animals with them when they travel, says the American Animal Hospital Association.</p>
        <p>That translates into 25 million dogs on highways and in skyways. So you're not hallucinating if you see a lot of wet black noses poking out of open windows on the highway (though experts say that can be dangerous).</p>
        <p>The hospitality industry is sitting up and taking notice. About 25,000 hotels, motels, inns and bed-and-breakfast establishments in North America now put out the pet welcome mat, according to ''Vacationing With Your Pet!,'' a travel guide for pet owners by Eileen Barish.</p>
        <p>The Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, for example, welcomes pets under 15 pounds at its 48 properties in 20 countries (except where animal quarantines are in effect). This summer, the Loews chain is trumpeting an open-door pet policy at all North American properties. Individual upscale hotels offer dog walking, pet sitting and pet cuisine as part of packages.</p>
        <p>But as most pet owners know, the family-lodging category is by far the leading option. Motel 6 and Red Roof, both owned by Accor, accommodate pets under 80 pounds at their 1,200 properties, except in the few cities that have laws against such policies.  The other leading chains, like Holiday Inn, Best Western, Days Inn and Super 8, accept pets at the discretion of individual franchises.</p>
        <p>Interviews with experts and other professionals yielded this snapshot of pet travel for summer 2000.</p>
        <p>BY AIR -- Under new federal regulations, airlines will not fly pets as cargo or in the baggage hold in temperatures above 85 degrees, which has put an embargo on most summer travel between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m., at least. If your pet weighs about 15 pounds or less and can fit into a small carrier that slides under the seat (10 to 11 inches by 18 to 24 inches), you are in luck. The cost ranges from $50 to $75, though airlines limit the number of pets per person and per cabin.</p>
        <p>If your pet exceeds the narrow size limit (most do), and you cannot exchange your ticket, you will need a pet-cargo service. Your pet may not arrive at the same time as you, especially since these companies are bound by the same temperature restrictions as commercial airlines. And the service is not cheap: $500 and up, depending on whether you want pickup and delivery of your animal. But the service includes handling all the logistics and practically hand-holding your pet.</p>
        <p>''The convenience of the air traveler with a pet is a thing of the past,'' said Dr. Walter Wolfe, the director of  Pet Moving Services in Tampa (800-635-3448), which receives referrals from major airline carriers like American and Continental.</p>
        <p>All airlines offer details and updates on pet transport on their Web sites.</p>
        <p>BY TRAIN -- Amtrak allows only service animals covered by the Americans With Disabilities Act. All others are prohibited, even in carriers.</p>
        <p>BY BUS -- Greyhound accepts only service animals aboard its buses. But some small regional carriers, like Green Tortoise (415-956-7500), accept pets in certain circumstances.</p>
        <p>BY CAR -- Not surprisingly, almost 90 percent of trips with pets are in cars. Experts suggest acclimatizing the pet to the vehicle, and not tackling a lengthy trip on the first run.</p>
        <p>Take along a photograph of your animal in case it gets lost. Make sure it is on a leash before you open the cage or carrier door, because animals often bound out after being cooped up. Remember to stop regularly to give the pet grass time and water. Before you go, check Web sites and directories that include listings of pet-friendly lodgings, pet parks and other services.</p>
        <p>FOREIGN TRAVEL -- If you are leaving the country, your pet will need a current health certificate and vaccinations, which are available from any licensed veterinarian. Call the embassy or consular office of your destination to find out about specific quarantines and requirements, and which animals are exempt. American officials treat animals re-entering the country as if they were arriving for the first time, so check with United States Customs regarding in-bound requirements from the foreign country you have visited.</p>
        <p>The Customs office offers information on traveling with pets at the Web site www.customs.gov/travel/ travel.htm (click Pets/Animals), or by calling (202) 354-1000.</p>
