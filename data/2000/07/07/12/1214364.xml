        <p>Honus Wagner, Ernie Banks and Cal Ripken played in three different eras. They were the best at their position in those eras. Imagine if Wagner, Banks and Ripken played in the same era. That mental exercise shouldn't be too difficult. Just look at the present era and think Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra and Derek Jeter. They are a conglomerate of shortstops the baseball world has never seen at the same time.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez, Garciaparra and Jeter were all in Atlanta last night on the same team, the American League All-Star team. Rodriguez was elected to start but recently suffered a concussion and couldn't play. Jeter started in his place and capitalized on the opportunity. He was named the most valuable player after rapping a double and two singles, scoring the A.L.'s first run for a 1-0 lead and driving in the next two against Al Leiter for a 3-1 lead, all in his limited night's work of four innings in a 6-3 victory.</p>

        <p>Honus Wagner, Ernie Banks and Cal Ripken played in three different eras. They were the best at their position in those eras. Imagine if Wagner, Banks and Ripken played in the same era.

        <p>Rodriguez, Garciaparra and Jeter were all in Atlanta last night on the same team, the American League All-Star team. Rodriguez was elected to start but recently suffered a concussion and couldn't play. Jeter started in his place and capitalized on the opportunity. He was named the most valuable player after rapping a double and two singles, scoring the A.L.'s first run for a 1-0 lead and driving in the next two against Al Leiter for a 3-1 lead, all in his limited night's work of four innings in a 6-3 victory.</p>
        <p>''You can't take it for granted,'' the Yankees' shortstop said of his All-Star performance. ''You never know if you're going to come back.''</p>
        <p>To hear Mike Bordick talk, the All-Star game will be a perennial part of Jeter's schedule. Bordick was here, too. Baltimore's shortstop, he was named to replace Rodriguez on the A.L. roster. The collective shadow of Rodriguez, Garciaparra and Jeter looms so large that Bordick wouldn't ordinarily even be noticed. He understands.</p>
        <p>''Just to be able to take ground balls out there with those guys is a great thrill,'' Bordick said. ''As a player and a fan, I'd want to see Alex on the field as well. It's unfortunate. I feel good that I was next in line and got this opportunity, but I'm upset that Alex got hurt.''</p>
        <p>Bordick laughed. ''People,'' he continued, ''have been asking me were you upset you weren't on the All-Star team? With Alex and Nomar and Derek, no, I wasn't upset at all. These are the guys who have been the superstars at that position ever since they've been in the league and they continue to be consistent that way and doing their superstar thing.''</p>
        <p>Because Bordick has no ego problem and certainly no illusions about his place vis-a-vis the terrifically talented threesome, it seemed to his listeners like a good idea to ask Bordick to offer his view and assessment of his contemporaries. However laudatory he was about all three, he kept coming back to Jeter, who has never been elected an All-Star starter.</p>
        <p>''Alex is certainly doing things, setting a precedent like Cal did,'' said Bordick, who plays alongside Ripken, now at third. ''Cal was the best-hitting shortstop in the game, a power-hitting shortstop. It seems like Alex is carrying it to another level.</p>
        <p>''Derek Jeter isn't going to have enough fingers for all the rings he's going to be wearing. With him as the Yankee shortstop and an incredible leader, not only does he do things consistently, putting up good numbers offensively, but defensively he's the one that keeps getting better out there. And Nomar Garciaparra, Ted Williams said he could be the best hitter of all time. These three guys are incredible. The thing about them is they do it every day and every year, year in and year out.''</p>
        <p>Bordick was asked what he sees when he watches them play.</p>
        <p>''Defensively, all three guys are different,'' he said. ''Alex is deceptive for as much ground as he covers for as big as he is. Sometimes it doesn't look like he's even moving, but he's covering so much ground he gets to these balls deep in the hole or up the middle and has an incredibly strong arm. Nomar throws from different angles and his body's all over the place, but he has that incredible gracefulness. Derek is just as well rounded as all of them. It seems like he can do it all out there, as far as the range, the arm, jumping and throwing. All three of them are just incredibly fun to watch.''</p>
        <p>If he could, Bordick added, he would meld them all together and ''make an incredible cyborg out of them.'' But he can't create that supersupersuper shortstop. So which one does he think is No. 1? He thought for a few seconds, then a few seconds more. ''I don't know,'' he said. ''I don't know.'' But in the end, it was the rings that made his decision for him.</p>
        <p>''Derek Jeter, to me, offensively is certainly consistent,'' Bordick said, then abandoned his effort to define his No. 1 by dissecting the elements of each one's game. ''He's got the rings and that certainly puts him apart from the others.''</p>
        <p>The rings are the three World Series rings Jeter has earned in his four years with the Yankees. The Yankees, in his young career, have gone to the World Series so often Jeter thinks that's a routine part of their schedule. But, Bordick was reminded, Jeter hasn't won those rings by himself.</p>
        <p>''Certainly,'' Bordick responded, ''but he's part of the backbone, in the middle of that field. He's showing his leadership skills and really taking hold of that team. I think the players rally behind him and Bernie. Definitely, when I watch Derek Jeter, I see him getting better and better. I'm not saying the other guys aren't getting better and better. It's just the rings that really put me on Derek Jeter's side. Pretty impressive.''</p>
