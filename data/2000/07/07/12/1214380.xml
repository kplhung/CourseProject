        <p>Three people were missing and feared dead last night after an explosion destroyed a three-story red-brick building near downtown Brooklyn and heavily damaged the house next door, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The 7:45 p.m. explosion, which reduced 420 State Street in Boerum Hill to a pile of beams and bricks and damaged its neighbor, 418 State Street, initially appeared to have been caused by a gas leak, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Three people were missing and feared dead last night after an explosion destroyed a three-story red-brick building near downtown Brooklyn and heavily damaged the house next door, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The 7:45 p.m. explosion, which reduced 420 State Street in Boerum Hill to a pile of beams and bricks and damaged its neighbor, 418 State Street, initially appeared to have been caused by a gas leak, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>A fire official said that a construction crew working on a school across the street from the buildings had been digging in the street with jackhammers around 4 p.m. and might have hit a gas line leading to the buildings. Members of the crew were being interviewed by fire marshals last night, the official said.</p>
        <p>Residents of the block, between Nevins and Bond Streets, smelled gas and called the authorities a short time before the explosion, a city official said. But officials of KeySpan Energy, the gas utility formerly known as Brooklyn Union, said they had found no evidence of a leak.</p>
        <p>The authorities said the owners of 420 State Street, Leonard Walit, 72, and his wife, Harriet, 66, could not be found, and a friend said they had entered their building moments before the explosion. At 11:20 p.m., a police dog trained to sniff for humans seemed to have located someone in the rubble, the police said.</p>
        <p>The other missing person was believed to be inside 418 State, the two-unit brick house next door, Mayor Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>Residents of seven buildings that flank 418 and 420 State Street were evacuated from their homes.</p>
        <p>All evening long and into the night, hundreds of firefighters and emergency workers clawed through the wreckage looking for survivors.</p>
        <p>Firefighters removed the debris of 420 State Street brick by brick, handing the bricks along from one man to the next. A crane so tall that it scraped off the tops of the trees that line the block was brought to the scene around 11 p.m.</p>
        <p>Sgt. Tom Collins of the Police Department's Emergency Service Unit said that firefighters had to painstakingly chop the pile away slowly; otherwise, the rubble could have tumbled down on anyone trapped inside. ''It's like a domino effect,'' he said. ''One thing goes, it's all going to start to go.''</p>
        <p>Hours after the explosion, clouds of dust floated around the buildings and the smell of gas was still in the air. Firetrucks and police cars lined the streets, blocking off the main thoroughfare, Atlantic Avenue, and many other blocks.</p>
        <p>The town house at 420 State Street was not recognizable as anything that had ever been a building. The only intact piece visible from the street was a single white shutter. The frame of its neighbor, another three-story brick house, was still standing, but officials said it was so badly damaged inside that it would have to be demolished.</p>
        <p>A friend of the Walits, Kristen Austin, said that moments before the collapse, they had helped a neighbor carry her baby and groceries into her house. Then they went inside, and seconds later the explosion rocked the block.</p>
        <p>''Our only hope is that they were in the ground-floor apartment in the basement,'' she said. ''Maybe they're downstairs and they're O.K.''</p>
        <p>But a fire official said the likelihood of finding survivors was ''pretty remote.''</p>
        <p>Kenneth Dinham, who works at a residential drug treatment center across the street from the collapsed building, said he went outside when he heard the explosion.</p>
        <p>''All I could see was smoke in the air,'' Mr. Dinham said. ''The windows moved, the place shook.''</p>
        <p>Noreen Davidsen, 58, who lived in the first-floor garden apartment of 420 State Street, was spared.</p>
        <p>She had left earlier in the day for her vacation house in Ocean Grove on the Jersey Shore.</p>
        <p>Between sobs during a telephone conversation with a reporter, she said she had no insurance and had lost everything. ''I'm wiped out,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But she was more concerned for the Walits. Mrs. Walit is a retired social worker; Mr. Walit a retired accountant. ''Harriet and Leonard, they're like my family,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Two people were rescued from 418 State Street and taken for medical treatment, but their injuries did not appear to be life-threatening, fire officials said. One firefighter whose arm was injured was treated at Long Island College Hospital.</p>
        <p>Karen Richter, 51, who lives across the street at 397 State Street, identified one of the two rescued victims as Julian Jackson, a resident of the building, and the other as a friend of his. A third person was still believed to be trapped inside.</p>
        <p>The collapse took place on a street of town houses, just blocks from downtown Brooklyn, that in recent years had been awarded boroughwide recognition for ''greening up'' by residents.</p>
        <p>Ms. Richter, who has lived on the block for 25 years, said that the Walits had moved in several years before her. She said they had seen their block, once seedy and dotted with rooming houses, completely transformed.</p>
        <p>''There were a lot of Native Americans -- Mohawks who helped build the bridges,'' she said. ''People who couldn't afford Brooklyn Heights bought over here. Houses that we all paid $25,000 for are now going for $600,000.</p>
        <p>Ms. Richter said she heard the explosion while watching television.</p>
        <p>''It was like the third world war,'' she said, ''this tremendous crash. I thought a bomb went off.''</p>
        <p>She ran to the front door and saw so much thick, acrid smoke that she could not see her hand in front of her face, she said.</p>
        <p>''Then I got out on the sidewalk and it started to clear,'' she said, ''and then I could see there was no house there.''</p>
