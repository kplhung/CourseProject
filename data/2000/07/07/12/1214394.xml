      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In their last eight World Series games and two All-Star Games, a team managed by Bobby Cox has been unable to beat a team managed by Joe Torre.</p>
        <p>''No, it wasn't them,'' Cox protested after the American League defeated the National League, 6-3, tonight.</p>
        <p>But Torre was the manager in the third-base dugout, and Derek Jeter was the guy who stroked three hits and accounted for the A.L.'s first three runs by scoring one and driving in two.</p>
        <p>Oh, that guy.</p>
        <p>''He played good,'' Cox, the Atlanta Braves' manager, conceded, ''They were good.''</p>
        <p>If Cox was familiar with Torre and the Yankees All-Stars, Jeter was familiar with the pitcher he faced in the fourth inning when he punched a tie-breaking two-run single.</p>
        <p>''He obviously knows what I'm going to throw,'' Al Leiter of the Mets said of the slider Jeter safely stroked. ''I've pitched to him a couple times the last few weeks. He jumped on the first pitch, got his hands in enough to get enough of the ball for it to land in the outfield.''</p>
        <p>No Retaliation Thoughts</p>
        <p>No, Al Leiter said, when he faced Derek Jeter in the fourth inning tonight, he did not consider resuming the nastiness that erupted at Yankee Stadium last Saturday night when the Yankees' Roger Clemens hit the Mets' Mike Piazza in the head with a 92 mile-an-hour fastball.</p>
        <p>''Nah, get out,'' Leiter, the Mets' pitcher, said. ''Jeter didn't do anything.''</p>
        <p>Leiter was the fourth National League pitcher in the game, though he had been scheduled to be the third. The switch, he suggested, might have had something to do with the rough inning he had that led him to become the losing pitcher.</p>
        <p>''Kevin Brown was supposed to pitch the second inning,'' Leiter explained, ''but by the time the pregame festivities were over and he began warming up, they had to go to Danny Graves because he wasn't ready. I wanted to make sure my warm-up was enough to be finished when Kevin was done pitching. Starting, you know how much time you need to warm up. I haven't relieved in about six years. I didn't know if I had enough so I ended up throwing a lot down there.''</p>
        <p>He walked Jermaine Dye, the first batter, and gave up a single to Travis Fryman, the second. They were the runners who scored on Jeter's single.</p>
        <p>No Discipline for Clemens</p>
        <p>Not that he has had any concern about it, but Roger Clemens appears to be safe from facing disciplinary action for his pitch that hit Mike Piazza in the head last Saturday night.</p>
        <p>A baseball official had said that Commissioner Bud Selig and others were concerned about the incident, but Sandy Alderson, Major League Baseball's chief of baseball operation, said he did not expect any action to ensue.</p>
        <p>''It's very difficult for us to try and reconstruct exactly what was going on or what was in the mind of the pitcher, as is the case in any of these incidents,'' Alderson said before tonight's All-Star Game. ''I will be surprised if there were any consequences emanating from our office.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he said, ''We review all of these situations.''</p>
        <p>Frank Robinson, vice president for on-field operations, will be the official who reviews the incident, Alderson said. ''I'll discuss that situation with Frank,'' he said.</p>
