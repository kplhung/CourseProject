        <p>The hunt continued yesterday for the disheveled man who fractured a young woman's skull with a concrete block on a Manhattan street, but the detectives were unable to narrow their search to a single suspect and made no arrests.</p>
        <p>Instead, investigators said, they were relying on the description of the assailant given to them by two witnesses who had seen an unkempt and heavy man walking in the neighborhood with a slab of concrete half an hour before the attack.</p>
        <p>The victim, Tiffany F. Goldberg, 25, was struck in the back of the head at 12:10 p.m. Sunday on East 29th Street, a few minutes after she left services at Marble Collegiate Reformed Church. She was released from the hospital on Monday.</p>
        <p>Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that detectives had pursued many leads on the case but that so far the suspects questioned by the police had been exonerated.</p>
        <p>''We have interviewed a number of people who fit the description,'' Mr.  Safir said. ''None of them have turned out to be the perpetrator. We are continuing to look for this individual. We will keep at it. We have a full-court press on this, and we expect we will solve this crime.''</p>
        <p>The police also announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the attacker. And a police supervisor said detectives had obtained videotapes from security cameras on buildings near where Ms. Goldberg was struck and were reviewing them to see whether they had recorded clear images of the attack or anyone who matched the assailant's description.</p>
        <p>Among the potential suspects the police were still seeking yesterday was a paroled criminal and drug offender with no known address for whom the State Division of Parole issued a warrant yesterday.</p>
        <p>The authorities were trying to locate Pierre Alston, 38, who failed to report last week to a state-mandated drug treatment program in the East Village. His last contact with the authorities was on July 7, when he left the 30th Street Men's Shelter --  blocks from where Ms. Goldberg was attacked two days later.</p>
        <p>The authorities said that Mr. Alston had not been directly linked to the crime or identified by any of the known witnesses. Instead, they said, an anonymous caller to the police implicated him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alston's build -- 5 feet 8 inches tall and roughly 200 pounds -- generally fits the description of the assailant, the police said, and his face has a strong resemblance to that in a composite sketch of the attacker released by the police.</p>
        <p>The state warrant was issued after Manhattan detectives notified parole officials that Mr. Alston was on their list of suspects, and officials discovered that by failing to report for drug treatment last week at Project Renewal on East 5th Street, he had violated the conditions of his parole.</p>
        <p>''In our effort to cooperate with the New York Police Department, we have a warrant out for this one particular individual,'' said Thomas P. Grant, a spokesman for the Division of Parole. ''Right now, this warrant is for technical violations. It's not for any criminal acts at this point. It's because he has failed to remain in contact with the Division of Parole.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alston has a criminal history reaching back to 1978, when he was convicted of third-degree robbery and was sentenced to five years' probation. He was convicted of third-degree weapons possession in 1988 and criminal sale of a controlled substance in 1992. His most recent conviction was in 1997, for selling two small bags of heroin to an undercover officer in Queens. He was sentenced to two to four years' confinement, and released on parole last year from the Queensboro Correctional Facility.</p>
        <p>Since last year, he had lived in Jamaica, Queens, where he held temporary jobs, and had also participated in a residential drug-treatment program at Samaritan Village in the Bronx. He was discharged from Samaritan Village last Monday after an argument with another participant in the program, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Citing confidentiality concerns, officials at the Samaritan Village declined to comment yesterday. But a resident there said Mr. Alston had physically attacked the other man, who had asked him to be quiet in the dormitory hall. ''He just barged the door open, started yelling at him, grabbed him by the neck and just shoved him,'' the man said.</p>
