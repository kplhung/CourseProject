        <p>Police investigators were searching yesterday for a mysterious masked man who has attacked four men late at night in Prospect Park in Brooklyn over the last two weeks.</p>
        <p>In one brazen attack early Friday morning, the police said, the man slashed a second victim less than an hour after a first assault, even as a police search helicopter hovered above the park, its spotlight scanning the ground.</p>
        <p>The attacker, who victims said mimicked martial arts movements before suddenly slashing them with an unknown object, appears to be seeking out gay men, said police officials who are investigating the case as a hate crime.</p>
        <p>The police would not say whether the victims were indeed gay. No one has been killed in the attacks, which were first reported yesterday in The New York Post.</p>
        <p>In response to the recent park assaults, the police said they were stepping up patrols and had assigned extra uniformed officers and detectives to the search. They said they planned to post fliers bearing a description of the man and advertising a $10,000 reward that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has announced.</p>
        <p>Some visitors expressed concerns yesterday about the safety of the park, which is known for its quiet hideaways off the beaten path.</p>
        <p>''I think it's pretty messed up that these people are doing stuff like that,'' said Anthony Rodriguez, 29, who stood by a quiet pond. ''I think they should have more police officers over here and close the park after a certain time.''</p>
        <p>According to the police, all the attacks happened in or near the Vale of Cashmere, a heavily wooded area with a pond and two large fountains, surrounded by a red-brick walkway that is just south of the park's entrance at Grand Army Plaza.</p>
        <p>The victims have described the attacker as wearing black clothing, and a mask or a kerchief on his face.</p>
        <p>All the attacks have occurred between midnight and 4 a.m. And in each case, the black-garbed attacker fled deeper into the park. But it is the unprovoked suddenness with which he attacks that the police said has become his disturbing calling card.</p>
        <p>''The perpetrator kind of like comfortably walks up and you don't know anything is going to happen,'' said Deputy Inspector Barbara A. Sicilia, commander of the Bias Investigating Unit. ''Then, boom, they are getting slashed and they are getting hit.''</p>
        <p>Councilwoman Christine Quinn, former executive director of the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, said that representatives from her office planned to meet with police investigators and community leaders in Brooklyn to discuss the attacks.</p>
        <p>Three of the four park victims are black. Gary English, executive director of People of Color in Crisis, an alliance of black gay men, said his group would be canvassing the park with fliers, warning visitors about the attacks.</p>
        <p>''It's very scary,'' Mr. English said. ''Historically, black gay men have been victims of attacks in the park. This is something that black gay men should be up in arms about.''</p>
        <p>The police said that the first attack occurred just after midnight on June 28. The victim, 33, said that a man wielding a wooden stick hit him and yelled, ''I'm going to kill you.''</p>
        <p>The second assault took place on the Fourth of July around 1:15 a.m. The attacker slashed the victim, 47, across the face, wrist, knee, ankle and back, the police said.</p>
        <p>The third attack, the police said, occurred around 2 a.m. last Friday near the zoo entrance. A man, 36, was walking on Flatbush Avenue when he was slashed across the face by a man who then fled. Within an hour, a 43-year-old man near the Vale of Cashmere was slashed on his head, neck, hands and arms.</p>
        <p>While the scope of the police investigation is centered on the four reported attacks at Prospect Park, Councilwoman Quinn worries that other assaults against gay men may have gone unreported by their victims, some of whom might not be openly gay, and others who simply might fear the publicity that could surround such a case.</p>
        <p>''There's a particular amount of shame involved with a victim of a bias crime,'' she explained. And because there is such a stigma, she said, ''Whatever has been reported is always the tip of the iceberg.''</p>
        <p>At the park yesterday, David Franklin, 28, said that the attacks were surprising, given the reputation for tolerance of nearby neighborhoods like Park Slope. But he noted that two weeks ago, a few blocks from the park, a young man called him an offensive name, mistakenly believing him to be gay.</p>
        <p>''I can't say it surprises me completely,'' he said of the attacks.</p>
