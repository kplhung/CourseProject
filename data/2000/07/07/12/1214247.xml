        <p>Forcibly separating a mother from her young children is always heartbreaking. It is even harder when they have been together 500 years. But that is what has happened here, where a bronze, ''The She-Wolf'' of the Capitoline Museums, has been separated from her legendary (and also bronze) children, Romulus and Remus, for an exhibition celebrating the myth of the founding of Rome.</p>
        <p>The exhibition, which runs until Oct. 15, inaugurates the opening of a new area of the Capitoline Museums, renowned for their collection of ancient Roman sculptures, including ''Dying Gaul,'' the ''Capitoline Venus'' and the ''Resting Faun,'' which inspired Nathaniel Hawthorne's 19th-century novel ''The Marble Faun.'' Admired by generations of illustrious visitors (the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli even wrote odes to their statues), the museums also have an important collection of paintings by Titian, Caravaggio, Guido Reni and Rubens.</p>

        <p>Forcibly separating a mother from her young children is always heartbreaking. It is even harder when they have been together 500 years. But that is what has happened here, where a bronze, ''The She-Wolf'' of the Capitoline Museums, has been separated from her legendary (and also bronze) children, Romulus and Remus, for an exhibition celebrating the myth of the founding of Rome.</p>
        <p>The exhibition, which runs until Oct. 15, inaugurates the opening of a new area of the Capitoline Museums, renowned for their collection of ancient Roman sculptures, including ''Dying Gaul,'' the ''Capitoline Venus'' and the ''Resting Faun,'' which inspired Nathaniel Hawthorne's 19th-century novel ''The Marble Faun.'' Admired by generations of illustrious visitors (the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli even wrote odes to their statues), the museums also have an important collection of paintings by Titian, Caravaggio, Guido Reni and Rubens.</p>
        <p>''The She-Wolf'' has always been a symbol of the Eternal City, diffused throughout the ancient world by Roman coins bearing the image. ''The She-Wolf'' celebrated in the exhibition is a fifth-century-B.C. statue donated to the city in 1471 by Pope Sixtus IV along with three other bronze statues that had been at the Lateran Palace. These statues formed the core of the Capitoline Museums collection, the world's oldest collection of public art.</p>
        <p>The bronze statues of Romulus and Remus were added after ''The She-Wolf'' arrived on the Capitoline. They were separated for restoration and study, but this has not produced any definitive indication of their possible creator or of their age, though scholars agree that the twins date from the Renaissance.</p>
        <p>The legend of Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome, is thought by some scholars to date to the fourth century B.C. The twin sons of Rhea Silvia and the god Mars, they were ordered drowned in the Tiber. Luckily for them, the basin in which they were placed came to rest at the site of the future Rome, and a she-wolf suckled them until the shepherd Faustulus found them.</p>
        <p>For five centuries Romans were accustomed to seeing the chubby cherublike brothers suckling the ferocious-looking ''She-Wolf.'' But today they are motherless.</p>
        <p>''It is the first time the twins have been separated from the Lupa in 500 years,'' said Claudio Parisi Presicce, who coordinated the scientific and technical aspects of the exhibition. ''I hope they won't suffer.'' He says that the technique used for casting the statues, similar to that used to make armor, may mean it was done in a famous workshop in Ferrara, which was very much in vogue at the end of the 15th century.</p>
        <p>''The She-Wolf'' and the statues of Romulus and Remus are on show in separate rooms in a new gallery for temporary exhibitions, part of a $20 million restoration that will more than double the Capitoline Museums area by the end of 2001. In late April the first phase of the so-called Grande Campidoglio (the big Campidoglio, as the Capitoline Hill is known in Italian) was completed.</p>
        <p>The collection of the Capitoline Museums is in two buildings, the Palazzo dei Conservatori and the Palazzo Nuovo. They face each other on Capitoline Hill, the highest of the seven hills of ancient Rome, and for centuries the political and religious heart of the city.</p>
        <p>So far, the improvements to the galleries have been mostly structural and cosmetic: improving the illumination (with enormous handmade Murano glass chandeliers), repainting the rooms in their original pastel colors, restoring the carved ceilings from a dull brown to their original multicolored intensity and cleaning parts of the collection.</p>
        <p>A tunnel connecting the three main buildings of the Capitoline, built in the early 1940's but closed for the last 30 years, was also reopened, providing access to the Tabularium, the first-century-B.C. Roman state archive built above the Roman Forum, affording a spectacular view of the ruins below.</p>
        <p>Restoration of a wing added in the 1920's when Mussolini was in power provided some surprises. When the floors were removed, workers found the remains of the foundations of the sixth-century-B.C. Temple of Jupiter, the most famous temple of ancient Rome. The restoration of this part of the museum was halted to allow the archaeological dig to continue. So far the finds have excited scholars. For instance, next to the temple, archaeologists discovered ruins that date from the 16th to the 6th century B.C., including tombs of small children.</p>
        <p>''This is all very important because the original situation of the Campidoglio was not known before this dig,'' explained Anna Mura Sommella, the director of the museum, ''but we have found a complex archaeological situation which will better explain the life of this hill.''</p>
        <p>Part of the remains of the Temple of Jupiter will be incorporated in a glass-domed area that will be built to house the original equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius. The statue, first put in the Campidoglio in 1538 as part of Michelangelo's design for the piazza, has been in the courtyard of the Palazzo Nuovo since 1990. (The horse and rider in the center of the Piazza del Campidoglio is a copy put there in 1997.) A fresco high up in the Room of the Eagles in the Palazzo dei Conservatori shows what Capitoline Hill looked like just before Michelangelo's project.</p>
        <p>Though the view overlooking the Forum from the Tabularium is spectacular, it is rivaled by the view from a newly opened cafe seating more than 300 on the terrace of the Palazzo Caffarelli, next to ''The She-Wolf'' exhibit. The cafe, a large bookstore and remodeled ticket offices are part of the museum's attempt at modernization. ''It is the oldest museum in the world, so we didn't want to change much,'' Ms. Mura Sommella said. ''But after all, this is no longer the 18th century, when Stendhal would visit the museum by candlelight.''</p>
