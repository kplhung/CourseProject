        <p>David Wells of the Blue Jays said that he plans to give David Cone a call before the second half of the season to give the struggling Yankee pitcher a pep talk. Wells, the Toronto left-hander, who pitched two scoreless innings as the American League starter tonight, said that he had already tried to call Cone but had not had any success reaching him.</p>
        <p>''He's never been through anything like this before,'' said Wells (15-2), who was a teammate of Cone's in New York in 1997 and 1998. ''It can get to you mentally. He's 37 years old and people are questioning him.''</p>

        <p>But Wells is confident that Cone  (1-7) can still be productive.</p>
        <p>''I've seen him do it for so long,'' Wells said. ''He's still got something left.''</p>
