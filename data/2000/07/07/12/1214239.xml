        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Cell Phone Rage: Helpful Hints'' (letters, July 8):</p>
        <p>I ride the Long Island Rail Road surrounded by cell phones, and I must say they hardly annoy me at all.</p>
        <p>I have seen an enormous change in America in the last 40 years. In the early 1960's, I traveled by train for three days from Seattle to New York. Granted, I was a somewhat shy young man, but I did not interact with a single human being the entire trip. Today, on even a short flight, someone will start a conversation with me.</p>
        <p>We've broken out of our social isolation, and we hunger for contact. We are connected not only by mobile phone but also by computer. And that's healthy and wonderful. How much better that these folks who want to communicate use their phones rather than sit there stewing in their own juices. The more we are in contact with each other the happier we will all be.</p>
        <p>So I easily forgive the occasional disturber of my precious privacy and smile at progress, which now puts us in such easy contact with each other.</p>
        <p>HENRY D. FISHEL  Glen Cove, N.Y., July 11, 2000</p>
