        <p>At 5 o'clock on a vacation morn, I tap my sleeping boy on the shoulder and whisper, ''Son,'' and he replies, ''Dad?'' and I say, ''Time to go sport fishing,'' and he says, ''Dad,'' and I say, ''Yes, son?'' and he says, ''Get out of my room.'' It's a family tradition.</p>

        <p>At 5 o'clock on a vacation morn, I tap my sleeping boy on the shoulder and whisper, ''Son,'' and he replies, ''Dad?'' and I say, ''Time to go sport fishing,'' and he says, ''Dad,'' and I say, ''Yes, son?'' and he says, ''Get out of my room.'' It's a family tradition.</p>
        <p>I don't know how to fish and he knows it. I go catch-and-release one better: I don't catch. But I like to go to the tackle shop and rent the equipment, find out where they're allegedly biting and buy the tackle shop T-shirt and some lures that couldn't possibly appeal to even the dumbest, most ravenous fish. ''Give me a couple of those blues bashers,'' those mouthwatering neon-orange hunks of plastic in tinsel hula skirts.</p>
        <p>My futile fishing pursuits began when I was a boy, and we didn't go on vacations, just out to a man-made pond hard by the Interstate, where no one ever caught anything and you had to be careful when casting not to hook the grill of a semi and be dragged all the way to the next toll plaza. Since then, I have reeled in no fish with a legendary fishing guide in Wyoming, who I believe retired shortly after our experience; our family of four caught one trout (at a cost of $800) with a guide in Montana; and I've gone surf-casting numerous times in Nantucket, with a cast-to-catch ratio of 10,000-to-3. I've not caught anything while ice fishing (a k a beer and schnapps drinking) in Minnesota, nor on the opening day of trout season in Missouri, where fishermen stand shoulder to shoulder in numbing waters in the dark, waiting for an air-raid siren to signal the official start at 6 a.m. Then, all hell breaks loose and they hook one another more often than they do fish.</p>
        <p>And there was that memorable excursion to Canada, where I'd heard tell that the trophy fish jump into your boat. My brother-in-law organized the trip, presenting himself as a fishing expert -- largely on the basis of his neat Orvis vest. In the boat, Uncle Bert carefully opened a jewelry box and removed a family heirloom: an antique Swedish sterling-silver lure that he tied on his line and cast out over the waters . . . out and out and out. ''Wow,'' I exclaimed. ''Awesome,'' remarked my son. ''Nooo,'' wailed Bert, realizing that the heirloom was sailing free of the line.</p>
        <p>Three hours and several lures later, I  hooked a northern pike, which, because of its fearsome teeth, Uncle Bert insisted on clubbing with a paddle to knock it cold before bringing it into the boat. But his paddle smack dislodged the hook from the fish, and away it swam. Later, my wife snagged a good-size fish as I scrambled to put on my gardening gloves so I wouldn't have to touch the slimy creature. Having no idea how to remove the hook, I quickly tossed the flipping thing into the cooler, threw on the top and cut the line. When we showed it off back at the dock, one of the locals cringed and said, ''Eww, a suckerfish!''</p>
        <p>I do have something to show for a lifetime of vacation fishing -- a smelt that I caught in the waters just off the Sears Tower in Chicago. For the piscatorially challenged, a smelt is one of your more diminutive species, measuring about four inches long. When I took it to the taxidermist, there among the boars' heads and nine-foot-tall grizzly bears, he removed it from the sandwich bag, examined it and asked, ''Would you like it in the fighting position?''</p>
