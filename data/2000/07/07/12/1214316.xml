        <p>The chairman of Consolidated Edison and New York State's top utility regulator, in their first joint appearance since a power shutoff in Manhattan last month, both said yesterday that New York City residents would have to accept a new generation of electricity plants to avoid a future of brownouts and soaring prices.</p>
        <p>The officials had been asked to appear before the City Council's Consumer Affairs Committee, which is looking into power failures and rising electricity costs, but instead of offering apologies, the regulator and the regulated both went on the offensive.

        <p>The chairman of Consolidated Edison and New York State's top utility regulator, in their first joint appearance since a power shutoff in Manhattan last month, both said yesterday that New York City residents would have to accept a new generation of electricity plants to avoid a future of brownouts and soaring prices.</p>
        <p>The officials had been asked to appear before the City Council's Consumer Affairs Committee, which is looking into power failures and rising electricity costs, but instead of offering apologies, the regulator and the regulated both went on the offensive. They said it was city lawmakers' job to convince residents who have raised environmental concerns about the construction of new plants, especially in matters of air quality, that the plants were a necessity.</p>
        <p>Con Ed's chairman, Eugene R. McGrath, said the balance of supply and demand had grown more and more uneven in the 25 years since the last power plant was built in New York City. He said the sharp increase in electricity rates expected later this summer, and the increasing difficulty of holding sufficient reserves during peak demand, suggested a bleak future if plants were not constructed. On June 26, which was the third-highest day of energy use in the city's history, Con Ed cut power to a two-block area of the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>The utility regulator, Maureen O. Helmer, chairwoman of the State Public Service Commission, was equally blunt.</p>
        <p>''I would ask you to work with your constituents to deliver the message that New York City, like other areas of the Northeast, the Midwest and California, is indeed in a very serious situation,'' Ms. Helmer said. ''The most important step we can all take is to expedite the process for power plant siting.''</p>
        <p>Members of the City Council, which has no authority to regulate Con Ed or the prices it charges, mostly just seethed in frustration.</p>
        <p>''I have to ask you this: we can't hold you accountable for the negligence of the federal government or state oversight regulatory bodies?'' said Stephen J. Fiala, a Council member from Staten Island, in questioning Mr. McGrath. ''What is within your control?''</p>
        <p>The Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said the real message of the hearing was that deregulation of the power industry, which began in the mid-1990's, had failed.</p>
        <p>''It's a real mess,'' Mr. Vallone said. ''It doesn't protect our prices, what we're paying for it, and it doesn't protect our quality of air.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone called the statements by Ms. Helmer, who has great clout in power plant decisions as chairwoman of the State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment, particularly troubling.</p>
        <p>''Right now, the people who are in charge of our destiny, the Public Service Commission, apparently feel it's not their jurisdiction to concern themselves about our environment,'' he said. ''That's a startling admission.''</p>
        <p>A heightened conflict between the city's energy needs, which have grown sharply in recent years, and concerns about its air quality is only one of the points of tension that electricity experts say is looming for New York. Some Council members expressed concerns, for example, that ever-rising energy prices could short-circuit the city's economic boom, especially among high-tech companies with large demands for energy.</p>
        <p>Moreover, regulators and industry experts said at the hearing, in an unregulated market, power plant builders would build only where they could make a profit, which means that even if lawmakers wanted to go back to the monopoly days of price controls on electricity, the city would suffer because power plant builders and suppliers would simply sell their electricity elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''You can't put the genie back in the bottle,'' said Edward A. Smeloff, executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project.</p>
        <p>Con Ed, which has sold most of its power plants in New York to retool itself solely as an energy provider,  has said the price of electricity it is buying is going to rise this summer, and consumer utility bills could rise by up to 30 percent in July and August compared with last summer's bills. Mr. McGrath said Con Ed could not do much about the increase because ''the market, not Con Edison, sets the prices.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Smeloff said that while the market might have become a powerful force in the newly deregulated industry, supply and demand did not explain everything. In every other state, he said, regulators have imposed rate freezes to protect consumers during the transition to a competitive market, or at least required electricity companies to delay passing on cost increases to their customers.</p>
        <p>Only New York, he said, allows a utility to pass on price increases to consumers immediately.</p>
        <p>Several Council members appeared to seize on that statement, which suggested the possibility of assigning blame for the city's energy troubles on human behavior rather than anonymous market forces.</p>
        <p>''It seems that someone's been asleep at the switch,'' Mr. Vallone said.</p>
