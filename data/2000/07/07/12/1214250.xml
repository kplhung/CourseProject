        <p>Arriving at teatime in long dresses and tuxedos, visitors to the Glyndebourne Festival here scurry from the parking lot under golf umbrellas, while the same summer showers never disturb the sheep grazing uphill. Glyndebourne is as it always was, and the solidly central repertory this year -- the three Mozart comedies to da Ponte librettos plus revivals of three 20th-century classics in proven productions -- may have been chosen to enhance that impression and cover a period of change.</p>
        <p>This is the last Glyndebourne season assembled by Anthony Whitworth-Jones as general manager, and the last with Andrew Davis as music director and Graham Vick as director of productions.</p>

        <p>Arriving at teatime in long dresses and tuxedos, visitors to the Glyndebourne Festival here scurry from the parking lot under golf umbrellas, while the same summer showers never disturb the sheep grazing uphill. Glyndebourne is as it always was, and the solidly central repertory this year -- the three Mozart comedies to da Ponte librettos plus revivals of three 20th-century classics in proven productions -- may have been chosen to enhance that impression and cover a period of change.</p>
        <p>This is the last Glyndebourne season assembled by Anthony Whitworth-Jones as general manager, and the last with Andrew Davis as music director and Graham Vick as director of productions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis and Mr. Vick are occupied with the Mozart operas, and intensively so: Mr. Vick is staging all three, and for a short period at the end of this month Mr. Davis will be conducting the three productions on consecutive nights. Meanwhile the 20th-century pieces are in other hands, and exceedingly capable ones to judge from this evening's performance of Janacek's ''Jenufa,'' with Nikolaus Lehnhoff bringing his vivid production to life again.</p>
        <p>The Czech conductor Jiri Belohlavec clearly spoke the music's language, especially when it came to having the orchestra repeat phrases that had just been sung. These repetitions, often doubled, are among the score's most original features, and they convey the sense of emotions so strong they have escaped from their owners' minds and bodies, out into the musical air.</p>
        <p>In a similar way extremes of feeling -- passions, whether revealed or repressed -- seemed to be bleeding into the visual environment represented by Tobias Hoheisel's sets and Wolfgang Gobbel's lighting. Simple shapes, strongly colored and textured, dominated the first act, set outdoors: the side of a red barn, a green grass bank, gold and gray light behind the jagged hills. For the following acts the setting was a long room -- bare, scrubbed and symmetrical -- and lighted at the end in phosphorescent blue.</p>
        <p>This was an appropriate color for the triumph of a character who has been carved and chastened by the opera's events but by no means crushed. Jenufa -- as played and sung by Amanda Roocroft, magnificently -- had the inner resources to withstand her desperation. Her voice was keenly expressive throughout but also decisive and centered, which made it not only beautiful but firm, the voice of someone whose capacity to feel is equaled by her determination to survive.</p>
        <p>At the end she did not so much accept Laca, her second choice, as accept life. Persons and customs had taught her that she could not have what she wanted, even though what she wanted was generous and true. But her spirit, richly expressed in Ms. Roocroft's singing, remained sure. From this point she would want, fully, what she had.</p>
        <p>The surrounding cast was excellent. Opposing Jenufa's radiant spontaneity with stern morality but no less ardor, Susan Bickley was a forceful, human and even sympathetic Kostlenicka. Stefan Margita's voice for Laca, green as the grass and harsh-edged, conveyed the character's intensity and instability unflinchingly.</p>
        <p>The weak-willed Steva was sung by Par Lindskog with an appropriately more rounded and pleasurable kind of lyricism. He will be with the company when it comes to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in February with another Janacek opera staged by the same team, ''The Makropulos Case.''</p>
