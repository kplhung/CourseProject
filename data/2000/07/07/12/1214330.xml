        <p>Painting a picture of the Hartford police as a department in administrative disarray, Connecticut's chief state's attorney complained today that the force had failed since early last year to hand over about $775,000 in drug money and other criminal assets seized by its officers.</p>
        <p>State law requires all municipal police departments to send money taken from individuals they arrest to the state court system, which generally gives back 70 percent of drug-related money as an incentive. Police departments use the cash to upgrade equipment and pay for training.</p>

        <p>Painting a picture of the Hartford police as a department in administrative disarray, Connecticut's chief state's attorney complained today that the force had failed since early last year to hand over about $775,000 in drug money and other criminal assets seized by its officers.</p>
        <p>State law requires all municipal police departments to send money taken from individuals they arrest to the state court system, which generally gives back 70 percent of drug-related money as an incentive. Police departments use the cash to upgrade equipment and pay for training.</p>
        <p>But mismanagement by the Hartford Police Department -- which was sharply criticized as disorganized in an independent study last fall  -- is costing the force about $260,000, said State's Attorney John M. Bailey.</p>
        <p>''If you were getting 70 percent of the money back, wouldn't you hand it over?'' Mr. Bailey asked today, his face bearing a half-smile of incredulity. ''This is a great deal of money. It has to be accounted for.''</p>
        <p>Police officials would not discuss the late payments with a reporter today, saying no one was available to comment until the department's spokesman, Sgt. Neil Dryfe, returned from vacation on July 17.</p>
        <p>Hartford's city manager, Saundra Kee Borges, said the Police Department was disputing the amount of drug-related forfeitures it must turn over to the state. Of the $775,000 total, Mr. Bailey contends that $375,000 is drug-related money owed by the department, but the police believe the amount is about $200,000, Ms. Borges said.</p>
        <p>The last time the Hartford police turned over a batch of confiscated money was April 1999, when it gave the state $112,544, Mr. Bailey said. Until today, he said, one day after he appeared on a local news program to complain publicly, the Hartford police had refused to turn over any more money or even explain what the problem was.</p>
        <p>Christopher M. Malany, an assistant state's attorney clearly exasperated by the department's lack of cooperation, said: ''That was one of the more disturbing aspects of this. We tried to enter into a dialogue with them and they didn't respond. There is no logic to it.''</p>
        <p>After a year passed with no money from the Hartford police, Mr. Bailey wrote a letter on May 1 to the acting police chief, Deborah Barrows, asking for an estimated $780,000 in overdue funds. On May 30, Chief Barrows replied with a letter promising to turn over $257,684 within two weeks.</p>
        <p>''We didn't get the money,'' Mr. Bailey said.</p>
        <p>He produced a copy of a letter sent by Chief Barrows to the city manager, Ms. Borges, on June 19, promising to have the department's bookkeeping straightened out within four days. Time passed, but Mr. Bailey still did not get the money. He held meetings with Mayor Mike Peters and Ms. Borges.</p>
        <p>''We were stunned by what was happening,'' Mr. Peters said. But even after the meeting, the police did not turn over any money, supplying instead what the mayor said were implausible excuses.</p>
        <p>First, Mr. Bailey recounted, the police said their administrative staff was badly depleted from recent retirements and other departures. Then they mentioned a problem tranferring the money electronically. ''They explained to me that they couldn't get a bank account,'' Mr. Bailey said, though finding a bank had never been a problem between 1989, when the state forfeiture law began, and April 1999, when the Hartford police last complied with it.</p>
        <p>Out of frustration, Mr. Bailey said, he wrote to the state auditor of public accounts last month to complain. Finally, on Monday, he went to the news media. Since his appearance on the 6 o'clock news that evening, Hartford police officials seem to have found $125,000, which they promised to hand over to state officials today, Mr. Bailey said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Peters called the issue ''a huge embarrassment'' that only increased the urgency of the city's national search for a permanent police chief to lead the department into better times.</p>
        <p>''If no one is going to be in charge,'' the mayor went on, ''then get the hell out of the way and let's get someone in charge. It's like every other week there's something going on in that department that doesn't make any sense.''</p>
        <p>Last October, an independent study of the Police Department, commissioned by city officials, found that crime-fighting units were disorganized and that cash and property had been stolen from the department's evidence room.</p>
        <p>Early this afternoon, Mr. Bailey said he was hopeful that the police would deliver the promised $125,000.</p>
        <p>But at 5 P.M., he called a reporter to say that the money still had not arrived. ''I'm going to stay for 15 more minutes,'' Mr. Bailey said wearily. ''Hopefully it'll show up.'' But it never did.</p>
