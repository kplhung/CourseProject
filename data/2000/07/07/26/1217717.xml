        <p>LIKE pasta, pizza is one of the easiest meals to make fast and vary endlessly. And if you skip the usual cooked tomato sauce on top, pizza seems even simpler. Just start with raw ingredients, especially the fresh herbs and vegetables of summer, augmented by a little richness, like cheese or sausage.</p>
        <p>There may be more possible combinations of pizza toppings than moves in chess or atoms in the universe, but I've found that using the fewest components works best. Too many ingredients merely muddy the flavors. Just zucchini, sausage and garlic, for example, will deliver intense but clear tastes.</p>

        <p>LIKE pasta, pizza is one of the easiest meals to make fast and vary endlessly. And if you skip the usual cooked tomato sauce on top, pizza seems even simpler. Just start with raw ingredients, especially the fresh herbs and vegetables of summer, augmented by a little richness, like cheese or sausage.</p>
        <p>There may be more possible combinations of pizza toppings than moves in chess or atoms in the universe, but I've found that using the fewest components works best. Too many ingredients merely muddy the flavors. Just zucchini, sausage and garlic, for example, will deliver intense but clear tastes.</p>
        <p>The simplest pizzas begin with basic combinations: olive oil and salt with rosemary and minced garlic, chopped onions or chopped shallots; freshly grated Parmesan with sage; shallots with olive oil and thyme;  chopped basil with garlic and oil.</p>
        <p>Sliced tomatoes, mozzarella and basil also fall into the basic category, but even that mix can be varied with great results. Green tomatoes are good companions for Parmesan and basil.</p>
        <p>Fresh toppings should never be too wet or the dough will become soggy. Fresh tomatoes should be seeded and drained; other moist vegetables like zucchini should be thinly sliced and salted and left to drain so they exude some liquid. Toppings that are  too dry are liable to fall off, though that's not an issue with these. It's unlikely that you'll be eating pizza you make yourself while walking down the street, and you can handle dry pizzas pretty efficiently with a plate, knife and fork. Some people think all pizzas have to have cheese to bind the other ingredients, but this is ridiculously limiting.</p>
        <p>Corn kernels, freshly cut off the cob, make a crunchy topping with shredded arugula and diced bacon; the bacon helps the other ingredients adhere to the crust. Black olives add a twist to a typical tomato topping.</p>
        <p>As for the dough, there are three ways to produce it (by machine, by hand, by shopping) and three ways to cook it (on a baking sheet or a pizza stone in the oven, or on the grill). In every case, a very high temperature is essential for the best crust. Professional pizza ovens cook at 700 degrees or higher.</p>
        <p>Using the food processor is quick and efficient, but you can also make the dough by hand; it's not difficult. I use instant yeast because it works much better than the regular kind. Or you can buy dough, either in the supermarket (usually in the freezer; use white bread dough if specially prepared pizza dough isn't available) or from a local pizza shop (just ask; you'll usually be accommodated).</p>
        <p>The dough can be mixed from an hour to two or three days before you want to cook the pizzas. You can also keep dough for weeks in the freezer.</p>
        <p>Like nearly identical bread dough, pizza dough is best when it is moist and a little sticky, so use flour judiciously. The dough should be allowed to rest, especially before and during the final shaping, although you can cut corners.</p>
        <p>If you are patient, and stretch the dough a little bit at a time, you can produce a thin crust without tearing it. Small pizzas are easier to handle than large ones, especially if you're grilling. If necessary, grill or bake the pies sequentially, eating one while the second is still cooking. Or serve them at room temperature, as is commonly done in Italy.</p>
        <p>An oven lined with a baking stone (or  several uncoated quarry tiles) is ideal for baking pizza, but it requires a flat sheet of wood or metal with a long handle, called a peel, to move the pizza about. A baking sheet, with or without a lip, is easier to use, because you can press the dough right onto it and get the thinnest crust. Olive oil, on the pan and on your hands, will prevent sticking.</p>
        <p>Grilling pizza is easier than you might think; the dough never sticks to the grill, and it develops lovely grill marks, a crisp crust and good flavor.</p>
        <p>To do it, start a medium-hot charcoal or wood fire, or preheat a gas grill to the maximum. Roll or lightly press a ball of risen pizza dough into a flat round, lightly flouring the work surface and the dough only as necessary. Let the dough sit a few minutes, and then roll or pat it out as thin as you like, turning occasionally and sprinkling the top with flour as necessary.</p>
        <p>Slide the crust directly onto the grill. Cook until brown grill marks appear, about three to five minutes. Flip the dough over with a spatula or tongs, lay on whatever topping you choose, cover the grill and cook until the bottom is crisp and brown and the topping is hot.</p>
        <p>If you have a pizza stone built into your oven, shape and top the dough right on the peel, and then slide it into the oven. The timing is about the same as for pizza cooked on a baking sheet, or perhaps just a bit shorter.</p>
        <p>PIZZA DOUGH  Time: 1 hour or more</p>
        <p>3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, plus more as needed  2 teaspoons instant yeast, such as SAF-Instant Yeast.  2 teaspoons coarse sea or kosher salt, plus extra for sprinkling  1 to 1 1/4 cups water  2 tablespoons olive oil.</p>
        <p>1. If using a food processor, combine flour, yeast and salt in work bowl. Turn machine on and add 1 cup water and the oil through the feed tube. Process 30 seconds, adding up to  1/4 cup more water, a little at a time, until mixture forms a ball and is slightly sticky to the touch. (In unlikely event mixture is too sticky, add flour, a tablespoon at a time.) To make dough by hand, combine half the flour with the yeast and salt in a bowl and stir to blend. Add 1 cup water and the olive oil; stir with a wooden spoon until smooth. Add remaining flour bit at a time; when mixture becomes too stiff to stir with a spoon, begin kneading, adding as little remaining flour as possible, just enough to keep dough from being sticky mess. Knead 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Turn dough onto a floured work surface and knead by hand a few seconds to form a smooth, round ball. Transfer to a bowl and  cover with plastic wrap; let rise until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. (You can cut rising time if you are in a hurry, or you can let dough rise more slowly in refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours.) Dough can then be used immediately or wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and  frozen for a month. Defrost in covered bowl in refrigerator or at room temperature.</p>
        <p>3. Form risen dough into a ball and divide into two or more pieces; roll each into a ball. Place each on a lightly floured surface, sprinkle with a little flour, and cover with  plastic wrap or a towel. Let rest until slightly puffed, about 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>4. Oil one or more baking sheets, then press each dough ball into a flat round directly on  sheet. Pat out dough as thin as you like, using oiled hands if necessary.</p>
        <p>5. Proceed with any recipe.</p>
        <p>Yield: Enough dough for 1 large, 2 medium, or more smaller pizzas.</p>
