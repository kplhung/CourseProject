        <p>Some of New York City's biggest roofing contractors routinely used nonunion labor even though their contracts for large public-works projects barred them from doing so, prosecutors said yesterday in announcing the indictments of 13 people and 5 companies.</p>
        <p>As part of the scheme, which involved more than 150 municipal construction projects throughout the city and Westchester for the last three years, roofing contractors bribed union officials to overlook the nonunion hiring and also laundered the profits that resulted from hiring the cheaper labor, Manhattan prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>The intricate scheme began when a dozen roofing contractors -- who had lucrative contracts with city agencies including the School Construction Authority as well as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- sought to slash their payrolls and employ cheaper nonunion roofers, in violation of their contracts and city rules.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors say that in order to gain cooperation from the labor union, Local 8 of the United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers, the contractors offered officials there bribes of up to $50,000, or 10 percent of the amount of the contracts.</p>
        <p>The 18-month inquiry of the roofing industry was carried out by the Manhattan district attorney with the inspector general for the School Construction Authority, and those indicted were charged with labor bribery, money laundering and other profit-making schemes.</p>
        <p>Under the state's Organized Crime Control Act, prosecutors charged Joseph Delancey, who is accused of being the ringleader, and his associates with enterprise corruption, which carries a possible sentence of 25 years in prison.</p>
        <p>The victims were the union's ''hard-working members and the agencies who pay for these projects,'' the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said at a news conference yesterday announcing the indictments. The investigation is ongoing, he said, and has already generated 22 search warrants and 5 months of evidence presented to a grand jury.</p>
        <p>Construction experts estimate that half the costs at any given construction site are for labor, particularly in New York City, where the work force is largely unionized. For example, while union roofers get paid $42 an hour, nonunion roofers will work for $9 to $18 an hour.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors allege that Mr. Delancey, 65, was one of a dozen contractors who did this math, and decided to hire nonunion roofers for jobs that required union ones. Those jobs included roofing work at La Guardia Airport in Queens, the Merrill Lynch teleport on Staten Island and 13 public schools, including John Dewey High School in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Felix Gilroy, a lawyer for Mr. Delancey, said that his client pleaded not guilty and that the judge released him on $30,000 bail. Mr. Gilroy said  his client was in ''very ill health.'' He also added there were extensive issues surrounding the wiretaps that investigators used.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said Mr. Delancey and his associates infiltrated Local 8 and other roofing contractors, paying off union business agents to look the other way as they hired nonunion labor.</p>
        <p>Investigators also contend that Mr. Delancey and others generated phony payrolls, paid workers reduced wages in cash and laundered profits from the scheme through a company in Passaic, N.J., named Central Cleaners, which prosecutors say was in fact a licensed check-cashing store and money order distributor and not a dry cleaner.</p>
        <p>Last year, as envelopes of cash were passed across the counters of Central Cleaners, more than two dozen investigators watched and wiretapped the proceedings, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>As to questions of whether agencies like the School Construction Authority had failed to be vigilant, Mr. Morgenthau responded: ''Fraud and forgery are always difficult to discover, and that's why we're doing these cases. If you defraud a public agency, you're going to be found out and prosecuted.''</p>
