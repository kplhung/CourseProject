      <block class="full_text">
        <p>At the end of two weeks of marathon negotiations with the leaders of Israel and the Palestinians, a visibly fatigued President Clinton announced today that they were unable to reach an agreement ''at this time.''</p>
        <p>The president and other American mediators made clear that it was Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who balked in the end, and by all accounts the issue was Jerusalem, the Holy City both Israelis and Palestinians claim as their sacred capital.</p>
        <p>Speaking at the White House, Mr. Clinton singled out the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, for his readiness to make hard compromises. ''I would be making a mistake not to praise Barak, because I think he took a big risk,'' the president said. ''The prime minister moved forward more from his initial position than Chairman Arafat, particularly surrounding the question of Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>He also declared that the discussions at Camp David had been ''really unprecedented'' in raising issues ''that had long been considered off limits.'' The issue of Jerusalem in particular had never been discussed before by Palestinians and Israelis in face-to-face encounters.</p>
        <p>''Under the operating rules that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, they are of course not bound by any proposal discussed at the summit,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''However, while we did not get an agreement, significant progress was made on the core issues.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton convened the summit talks in an ambitious attempt to reach a sweeping settlement before Sept. 13 on questions -- such as the shape of a new Palestinian state, the future Palestinian refugees -- that have kept the two sides in a state of conflict for 52 years.</p>
        <p>No side announced any immediate plans to resume talks, and Mr. Arafat's declared intention to unilaterally proclaim a Palestinian state on Sept. 13 imposed the next serious deadline on a process that has seesawed from hope to despair and back since the Oslo agreements were signed in 1993.</p>
        <p>In a somber parting statement, Mr. Barak laid the full blame for the setback on Mr. Arafat, and declared that Israel was prepared for ''every possibility.'' But he did not exclude another try: ''The vision of peace suffered a major blow, but I believe that with good faith, good will on all sides it can recuperate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat made no comment before departing the United States. But his chief negotiators, Saeb Erekat and Mahmoud Abbas -- more commonly known as Abu Mazen -- put an unexpectedly optimistic face on Camp David, saying that the negotiations had laid groundwork for an agreement by Sept. 13. ''What happened at Camp David are seeds that will grow very fast,'' Mr. Erekat  said.</p>
        <p>The two-week sequestered talks at Camp David, which included round-the-clock negotiations -- much of the time with Mr. Clinton as mediator and go-between, as well as threatened walkouts and at least one narrowly averted breakdown, marked one of the most intensive mediating efforts by an American president in the Middle East since Jimmy Carter brokered a peace between Israel and Egypt in 1978.</p>
        <p>In some respects, it was hardly surprising, Mr. Clinton said, that the summit meeting, with its qualities of an almost brutal showdown in close quarters, had not produced what he wanted. ''This is like going to the dentist without have your gums deadened,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At the end, the Israeli and Palestinian leaders left the rainy hills of Maryland for the Middle East confronting the potential for increased violence and political uncertainty -- particularly in Israel, where Mr. Barak faces criticism for considering concessions to the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>In a briefing before he left for home, Mr. Barak put the onus of failure squarely on Mr. Arafat. ''We were ready to end the conflict, we looked for an equilibrium point that will provide a peace for generations, but unfortunately Arafat somehow hesitated to take the historic decisions that were needed in order to put an end to it,'' the Israeli leader said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat flew out of Washington without speaking publicly. But his aide, Mr. Erekat, insisted that an agreement could be reached no later than Sept. 13. ''The prospects for agreement on all permanent-status issues are stronger than at any time in almost nine years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Instead of the comprehensive agreement the White House had hoped for, the summit talks concluded with a five-point statement of ''negotiating principles'' agreed to by the Israelis, the Palestinians and the United States.</p>
        <p>The document said that the two sides understood the ''importance of avoiding unilateral actions that prejudge the outcome of negotiations'' and that differences would be resolved ''only by good faith negotiations.''</p>
        <p>More particularly, the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said it was Mr. Arafat who had a lot of thinking to do.</p>
        <p>''Barak was far more willing to think out of the box, far more willing to consider, though he never accepted, solutions that could have broken the logjam,'' Mr. Berger said. ''Arafat on the other hand, while he did make some compromises on Jerusalem, was not prepared at this point to crack open his traditional positions.''</p>
        <p>A best hope, Mr. Berger said was that the summit meeting would provoke a reassessment within the Palestinian delegation, a group of about a dozen of Mr. Arafat's top political and security aides.</p>
        <p>Coinciding with the last days of the summit talks, the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, met with other Arab leaders in the Middle East in a spurt of diplomacy, the goals of which were unclear.</p>
        <p>But a senior administration official said Mr. Mubarak did not help Mr. Arafat reach the bold decisions that the White House wanted. ''I didn't see any evidence that a positive influence was being brought to bear,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>According to officials involved in the negotiations, the prospects for an accord finally fell apart just after midnight Monday night, the second all-night session that President Clinton had led after returning to Camp David from Japan on Sunday evening.</p>
        <p>On Sunday and Monday nights, Mr. Clinton worked with negotiators from both sides and progress was reported on the borders of a Palestinian state, on the fate of the three million Palestinian refugees scattered through the Middle East and on security arrangements.</p>
        <p>''Then it came down to whether we could cut the Gordian knot on Jerusalem,'' a senior administration official said.</p>
        <p>For what turned out to be the last effort by the president to get the Palestinians to agree to a deal on Jerusalem, Mr. Clinton met with Mr. Arafat sometime after midnight.</p>
        <p>By then, Mr. Barak had made what the administration regarded as considerable concessions in relinquishing control to the Palestinians in the outer and inner suburbs of East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>The administration declined to go into precise details today, but in the last week of the summit talks, according to Israeli reports, proposals were put forward by the Americans on concepts of shared sovereignty in East Jerusalem. Mr. Barak was considering these ideas, which represented a radical departure from established Israeli policy that Jerusalem was the united, undivided capital of Israel.</p>
        <p>''We believe that the ideas raised by the president were far-reaching and justified a kind of positive response from Arafat. They didn't,'' Mr. Barak said at his news conference.</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Clinton spoke with Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader was unwilling to budge from his position that East Jerusalem must be the capital of the new Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>The question of sovereignty over the holy sites in Jerusalem, home to major places of worship for Jews, Christians and Muslims, was at the heart of the problem, the administration official said.</p>
        <p>''Think of Jerusalem as four concentric circles,'' the official said. ''Outer suburbs, inner suburbs, the Old City and the religious sites. As you move into the center, the issues become more intense, historical, religious.'' There was surprising convergence on how different parts of the city would be managed but severe disagreement on the notion of sovereignty.</p>
        <p>In that last conversation between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Arafat while the talks were still alive, Mr. Clinton tried to explain, once again, the advantage for Mr. Arafat in making a compromise on Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>''The president described one again what was at stake: gaining a state, international legitimacy, international economic support,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>Conversely, if Mr. Arafat let an agreement pass by, he could declare a state but it would be on 40 percent of the West Bank, and the Israeli reaction would be strong -- possibly the forcible annexation of the Jewish settlements.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Arafat rebuffed Mr. Clinton, the president's senior aides -- Mr. Berger, the secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, and the senior coordinator for the Middle East, Dennis Ross -- met with one of the Palestinian negotiators.</p>
        <p>They discussed, for one last time, the possibility of Mr. Arafat accepting a partial agreement that would deal with the shape of a Palestinian state, refugees and other matters, but would put the question of Jerusalem aside for the time being.</p>
        <p>This last effort did not appeal to Mr. Arafat either, who, according to the administration's account, felt that he would lose some of his leverage over Jerusalem if he settled on the other issues first.</p>
        <p>At 3 a.m., Mr. Arafat, ensconced in his cabin, called Birch, sent one of his negotiators to Mr. Clinton with a letter. The letter politely thanked Mr. Clinton for his efforts but said that Mr. Arafat could not accept the proposal on Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>This morning, Mr. Clinton met separately with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in sessions that focused on where the peace process would go now.</p>
        <p>Then there was a brief meeting of Mr. Arafat, Mr. Barak, and Mr. Clinton, only the second formal session of the three leaders, although they had sat together at dinner several times.</p>
        <p>Drained by the exhausting discussions, and in some respects pleased to be out of their confinement -- Mr. Barak referred jokingly to Camp David this morning as a prison -- the leaders went their separate ways.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and Mr. Barak both focused on the dangers of violence as the Sept. 13 deadline for the unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state approached.</p>
        <p>''We are at the end of an important stage of the peace process and at the threshold of an era of uncertainty,'' the Israeli leader warned before leaving for home.</p>
        <p>''Every day they go past it will put more pressure on the Palestinians to declare a Palestinian state unilaterally and more pressure on the Israelis to have some greater edge and conflict in their relations as a result of that,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>The threat of violence came as expected from Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the militant Islamic group Hamas, who issued a familiar warning to Israel from his headquarters in Gaza. ''This failure is another indication that the only choice we have is resistance,'' he said. ''Only by force are we able to retain our rights.''</p>
        <p>The Israel armed forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said that the Israeli Army was preparing for the possibility of increased violence. ''We don't want a confrontation in any way, and a lot is dependent on the Palestinians,'' General Mofaz said.</p>
