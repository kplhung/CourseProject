        <p>In ''Cell Phones and Safety'' (editorial, July 19) you mention the debate 70 years ago about safety implications of car radios. Let this reader tell you that the only time he ran off the road was just five years ago -- while changing stations on the car radio.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Cell Phones and Safety'' (editorial, July 19) you mention the debate 70 years ago about safety implications of car radios. Let this reader tell you that the only time he ran off the road was just five years ago -- while changing stations on the car radio.</p>
        <p>Recently in downtown Greenwich, Conn., I watched an apparently healthy young man in business dress talking on his cell phone as he began to cross the street against the policeman's dictate to wait. Unhearing at first, he got the message 10 feet into the street and backed up still talking. Then, when the officer waved him across, he was further distracted by his conversation and had to wait again until traffic cycled through before he finally made it.</p>
        <p>If walking is that difficult when using a cell phone, then its use when driving must certainly be outlawed.</p>
        <p>JOHN P. TIERNAN  Bedford, N.Y., July 20, 2000</p>
