        <p>BEFORE the ascent of Tiger Woods and Venus Williams, there was Manny Yarbrough.</p>
        <p>You won't find Mr. Yarbrough stepping lightly on the green or sliding across center court. After all, he's 6 feet 7, 720 pounds, give or take. But he scored an athletic breakthrough of his own and in an arena more unlikely than golf or tennis. In 1995, he became the first black man to win the international amateur sumo championship in Japan.</p>
        <p>So as Tiger Woods achieves golf greatness and the Williams sisters captivate the tennis world, Mr. Yarbrough has a little perspective on what he calls the ''ethnocentric pride'' of black athletes triumphing in sports that historically are the domain of other races.</p>
        <p>He attributes the excitement among African-Americans over Tiger Woods's career-crowning victory at the British Open last weekend to ''the appeal of a black guy doing really well,'' particularly in a sport ''not created with blacks in mind.''</p>
        <p>He said he's noticed signs of the shared thrill all over, from a picture of Venus Williams that his brother, who is not a tennis fan, has on his wall, to hearing Magic Johnson say the other day, ''I never watch golf, but when Tiger plays, I watch.'' Mr. Yarbrough says it's like ''Germans rooting for Germans and Estonians for Estonians.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yarbrough does not rank his own achievement with those of Tiger Woods, or that of Venus Williams at Wimbledon, but he has felt the reflected glow of that communal pride.</p>
        <p>''I was in Los Angeles doing a demonstration,'' he said, ''and some African-Americans wandered in. They found out I was a world champion, and they said, 'We're doing it in sumo also.' ''</p>
        <p>Often there is as much surprise as pride, if not more. ''People say, 'What is a black guy doing, doing sumo?' '' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yarbrough, 35, is not trying to make a political statement. He's simply trying to make the best of a big thing, combining his girth with the skills he honed as a football lineman and a wrestler at Rahway High School and later at Morgan State University in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Back home after leaving college, he worked a variety of jobs, including as a nightclub bouncer. He began studying judo at the Cranford Judo and Karate Center with Yoshisada Yonezuka, a former United States Olympic judo coach. In the early 1990's, when Japanese sumo officials started fielding wrestlers from around the world in hopes of making sumo an Olympic sport, Mr. Yonezuka turned to Mr. Yarbrough.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of big guys,'' Mr. Yonezuka said, ''but there are none as big as Manny. He had the experience of wrestling and judo, and he's very good with his hands.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yarbrough was skeptical. ''I was like everyone else and thought it was just two fat guys bumping bellies,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But wooed by a free trip to Japan, he trained at the ancient sport in which getting knocked down or knocked out of the ring means defeat.  ''I was basically playing offensive line,'' he said, although with more bows to opponents than trash talk.</p>
        <p>HE placed second in the 1992 competition and remembers every move of his 1995 title bout, not that there were many moves. ''We kind of fired into each other, and he stood up, and I just pushed him out,'' he said. ''It was less than five or six seconds.''</p>
        <p>The Japanese, having opened sumo to the world, greeted Mr. Yarbrough's victory with applause and flowers. He became a minor celebrity, appearing in commercials and on television shows in Japan and the United States. Recently, while shooting an ESPN commercial in his sumo loincloth, he was even razzed on the set by Venus Williams, she of the skimpy tennis dress. Now a spokesman for an Internet company, Urban Box Office, Mr. Yarbrough is trying to lose some weight that he says has dulled his competitive edge.</p>
        <p>Still, he's amazed by his whole experience: An African-American man from Rahway traveling the world competing in a 1,500-year-old Japanese martial art. O.K., it's not Tiger Woods completing the Grand Slam, but it's another little piece of evidence that, as Mr. Yarbrough said, ''it's becoming one world.''</p>
        <p>Not that there aren't reminders of the divided world. ''I felt it once in a store,'' he said. ''This guy was following me around like I was going to steal something. This was in Japan. Of course, I get that here, too. So it's no different.''</p>
