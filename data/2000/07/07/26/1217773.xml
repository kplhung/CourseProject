        <p>Seven weeks after Charles C. Conaway took over as chairman and chief executive of the Kmart Corporation, the company announced yesterday that it would take a pretax charge of $740 million for inventory clearance and store closings and said a substantial investment in technology would be critical to future growth.</p>
        <p>Kmart also warned yesterday that excluding this write-off, second-quarter earnings would miss expectations. Second-quarter results will be announced on Aug 10. The company is also expected to announce major management changes in the next several days.</p>
        <p>The bad news reported yesterday by the retailer, which is based in Troy, Mich., indicated that problems run even deeper than previously disclosed. Kmart said, for example, that it expected second-quarter earnings from operations to be 4 cents to 7 cents a share, down from 26 cents in the quarter a year earlier. Analysts had estimated earnings of 16 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>A $290 million charge for inventory reduction throughout the chain also puts a new light on the tenure of Floyd Hall, the previous chief executive. Until the first quarter of this year, Mr. Hall was able to boast of 12 consecutive quarters of earnings growth, but that apparently did not fully reflect a great deal of merchandise that in fact was piling up and would eventually have to be disposed of at a loss.</p>
        <p>The retailer also said that of the 72 stores it was closing, 6 were the Super K format. Kmart had said previously that the Super K format stores, which are extra large and sell groceries as well as apparel, were the key to future growth. Mr. Conaway denied that the six closings signaled a change in this particular aspect of Kmart's strategy. ''Not all Super K's are painted equal,'' he said. ''These are older stores that are not even close to our vision for the future.''</p>
        <p>As stores close, the company said, about 5,000 jobs, accounting for almost 2 percent of its 278,000 employees, will be eliminated. Some of the workers affected may find jobs at other Kmart stores, the company said. Kmart will take a pretax charge of $300 million for the closings, plus pretax charges of $75 million to write off the inventory in the closed stores.</p>
        <p>In addition, the company will take a $75 million charge for replacement of outmoded computer systems.</p>
        <p>The new chief executive said his basic focus was to force Kmart to demand a ''higher return on all its assets,'' from real estate to inventory. As a result, he said the company was closing stores that were profitable, but not profitable enough.</p>
        <p>Wall Street appeared unfazed by the changes. Shares of Kmart, which have been battered for weeks and are down from a high of $10 in March and a 52-week high of $16, declined again. They fell 18.75 cents, to $6.875.</p>
        <p>The write-offs provide Mr. Conaway ''a cleaner stage,'' conceded Richard L. Church, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ''But,'' he added, ''they've been unsuccessfully getting a return on investor capital for a long time. ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Conaway, who moved from his role as president of CVS to Kmart on June 1, has yet to articulate the details of his vision to make Kmart more competitive, but in its early outlines the vision appears to rely heavily on technology. The company has said it will spend $460 million to upgrade its information systems.</p>
        <p>Major initiatives under way, the company said, are the installation of new scanners in all stores, new registers in the company's 300 highest-volume stores and new systems to help Kmart's buyers monitor and manage inventory.</p>
        <p>In addition to replacing its outmoded computer systems, the company expects to invest $210 million to improve its distribution and logistics network.</p>
        <p>In interviews yesterday, Mr. Conaway gave some hint of how he hoped this technology would make Kmart's sales perk up.</p>
        <p>''He is aghast that he deals with technology that is 10 years old when his competitors have technology that is 2 years old,'' said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard Retail Trend Report. ''He wants to create a system where every buyer is completely informed every moment on how the purchases are doing and then really hold their feet to the fire.''.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conaway added that the systems would also dictate all sorts of decisions made by managers, like when to mark down merchandise. For example, he said, after two weeks of unusually cool weather hurt sales last spring, store buyers chose to wait to mark down a lot of apparel items, and they eventually had to take bigger cuts to match competitors. A new computer system, he said, would have demanded that the markdowns be made earlier and therefore would have reduced the total markdown that was needed to move the product.</p>
        <p>But analysts remain skeptical that technology will solve the retailer's biggest problems.</p>
        <p>''Look, you can buy technology,'' said George Strachan, with Goldman, Sachs, ''but you also have to infuse the culture with how to use technology, how to read the data. Besides, it is hard for me to imagine any company leapfrogging Wal-Mart.''</p>
