        <p>Ten years after the Americans With Disabilities Act became law, employers are still struggling to figure out who is covered by the law and what they are supposed to do to comply with it.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem, said Dr. Tom Hale, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is there are different definitions of disabled and the definitions are very political.</p>
        <p>Cornell University's program on employment and disability found in a recent survey of human resource managers that companies have had more success providing access for people who use wheelchairs than in providing services for people who have hearing or sight impairments.</p>
        <p>Dr. Susanne M. Bruyere, director of the Cornell program, said that was going to have to change. Given that there are a number of people with hearing impairments in the work force and the work force is aging, this will become an increasing problem, Dr. Bruyere said.</p>
        <p>The most important continuing obstacles to complying with the law seem to be lack of information and training and lingering stereotypes about what people with disabilities can do.</p>
        <p>Attitude barriers remain very high, Dr. Bruyere said. Often, biases can be the result of a lack of education.</p>
