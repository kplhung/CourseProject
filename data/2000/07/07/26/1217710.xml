        <p>HOW many food experts could possibly write a cookbook titled ''From My Chateau Kitchen'' and expect to be taken seriously? Would anyone not fortunate enough to live in a chateau be able to duplicate the recipes?</p>
        <p>The pretentious tone of the title aside, this book by Anne Willan (Clarkson Potter, $45) is accessible and reliable. Ms. Willan, the founder of La Varenne, a cooking school, uses her home in Burgundy, the Chateau du Fey, as La Varenne's summer headquarters (the American branch of the school, open in winter and spring, is at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia). Many of the dishes taught at Chateau du Fey, as well as those Ms. Willan serves to friends and family while in residence, are worth adding to the home cook's repertory.</p>

        <p>HOW many food experts could possibly write a cookbook titled ''From My Chateau Kitchen'' and expect to be taken seriously? Would anyone not fortunate enough to live in a chateau be able to duplicate the recipes?</p>
        <p>The pretentious tone of the title aside, this book by Anne Willan (Clarkson Potter, $45) is accessible and reliable. Ms. Willan, the founder of La Varenne, a cooking school, uses her home in Burgundy, the Chateau du Fey, as La Varenne's summer headquarters (the American branch of the school, open in winter and spring, is at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia). Many of the dishes taught at Chateau du Fey, as well as those Ms. Willan serves to friends and family while in residence, are worth adding to the home cook's repertory.</p>
        <p>This is the most relaxed, charming and personal of the many books by Ms. Willan, an Englishwoman who founded La Varenne in Paris in 1975 as the first school in France designed to teach French cuisine to Americans. The story of how she and her husband, Mark Cherniavsky, a retired banker, acquired the chateau, renovated it, installed the cooking school and won the trust of the suspicious local farmers and food purveyors is almost a fairy tale. At least you can work off your envy by cooking.</p>
        <p>The book has lavish photographs, with pictures of the lush countryside and profiles of neighbors in the village of Villecien, including the chateau caretakers, Roger and Francine Milbert, and the baker Robert Haumonte. Some were ultimately persuaded to lend their expertise to the school.</p>
        <p>Many alluring seasonal and regional recipes were inspired by tradition, while others are cutting edge. But local markets and restaurants seemed to inform all of them. The list of those that tempted me was long. For the most part the results were successful, needing almost no adjustment to suit my equipment or taste.</p>
        <p>Jambon persille (ham in aspic), a classic dish I had not made in years, was expertly interpreted for the home kitchen, using powdered gelatin and American ham, for example. Salmon seared on its spice-coated skin, then served on a bed of tender julienne vegetables, was utterly delicious, as was a simple lemon-dressed salad of slivered squash seasoned with dill.</p>
        <p>Rich twice-baked spinach souffles, served in a cream sauce and topped with cheese, were a convenient marvel when made in advance and capable of a second rising. In another souffle recipe, the very idea of using intense and satiny Epoisses cheese was almost too outrageous; the cheese is rare and a treat eaten on its own. I passed on that one.</p>
        <p>The saving grace in these rich dishes is that the suggested servings are fairly modest by American standards.</p>
        <p>All that a gratin of summer vegetables needed was crusty bread to sop up its savory herb and olive oil pesto. And though I was reluctant to consign a couple of pounds of green beans from a farm stand to a full hour in my wok with some butter, as Ms. Willan recommends for an English-sounding dish called burnt beans, I was not unhappy with the result (though I did add garlic).</p>
        <p>But a whole baked pineapple failed to caramelize as promised. Perhaps my baking dish was not large enough for the sauce to reduce properly, but the recipe did not specify dimensions. Thinking that the 325-degree oven -- which the recipe called for -- might not have been hot enough, I poured off the sauce, cooked it down on top of the stove and served it over the fruit to mixed reviews.</p>
        <p>The book ends with a wedding, that of the Cherniavskys' daughter, Emma. A perfect ending for a fairy tale.</p>
        <p>GRATIN OF SUMMER VEGETABLES IN HERB PESTO  Adapted from ''From My Chateau Kitchen''  Time: 1 hour 10 minutes</p>
        <p>2 medium zucchini, about  3/4 pound  2 medium yellow or pattypan squash (about  3/4 pound)  3 medium onions, sliced thin  1 pound ripe, firm, meaty tomatoes  Salt and ground black pepper to taste</p>
        <p>3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil  1 medium bunch basil, flat-leaf parsley, cilantro or mint  3 cloves garlic, peeled</p>
        <p>1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese  2 tablespoons pine nuts.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Wipe zucchini and squash with damp paper towel. Cut into  3/4-inch chunks and place in large bowl along with onions. Core tomatoes, cut into chunks and add. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>2. Brush 8-by-11-inch, 9-inch square or 10-inch round baking dish with a little oil.</p>
        <p>3. Reserve a couple of herb sprigs for garnish and tear remaining leaves from stems  (you should have 1 1/2 ounces). Place leaves in food processor with garlic, cheese, pine nuts and 2 to 3 tablespoons oil, and puree. With machine running, gradually add remaining oil through feed tube. Season pesto with salt and pepper, then toss with vegetables to coat.</p>
        <p>4. Spread in baking dish and bake until very tender and lightly browned, about 45 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature, decorated with herb sprigs.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
