        <p>At 11 on a Monday morning, heavy metal fans don't usually get the chance to swig a beer and plunge into a mosh pit. They did when Ozzy Osbourne's annual Ozzfest came to the PNC Bank Arts Center here.</p>
        <p>The 12-hour show, with 18 bands demanding audience participation, was a day for slam-dancing, crowd-surfing, shouting along and waving tattooed arms in the air. The songs were driven by barrages of drumming and blasts of guitar, professing diehard individualism and resistance to authority: ''Don't tell me how to live my life,'' Slaves on Dope rasped in the day's first set. But fans followed the bands' directions in coordinated group calisthenics for thousands.</p>

        <p>At 11 on a Monday morning, heavy metal fans don't usually get the chance to swig a beer and plunge into a mosh pit. They did when Ozzy Osbourne's annual Ozzfest came to the PNC Bank Arts Center here.</p>
        <p>The 12-hour show, with 18 bands demanding audience participation, was a day for slam-dancing, crowd-surfing, shouting along and waving tattooed arms in the air. The songs were driven by barrages of drumming and blasts of guitar, professing diehard individualism and resistance to authority: ''Don't tell me how to live my life,'' Slaves on Dope rasped in the day's first set. But fans followed the bands' directions in coordinated group calisthenics for thousands.</p>
        <p>Since the 1980's, touring as Mr. Osbourne's opening act has been a seal of approval for heavy metal bands. Ozzfest multiplied the opening acts; with changing lineups in various cities, 20 bands can claim to be anointed by heavy metal's genial ringleader this year. Ozzfest provides a quick survey of heavy metal past and present, and this year, it embraced hellfire and Jesus, melody and hip-hop.</p>
        <p>Mr. Osbourne arrived onstage with flames everywhere. Although he was wearing a T-shirt with ''Evil'' spelled out in silver glitter, he was not a threatening figure but a mischievous uncle. His songs, dating back to Black Sabbath in the 1970's, place clear melodies atop brawny guitar riffs and the band made them gleam. Every so often he splashed the crowd with (presumably unholy) water while his guitarist played speed-fingered arpeggios, trills and wailing high notes. Songs about murder and madness, war and Satan became happy sing-alongs.</p>
        <p>Pantera, preceding Mr. Osbourne, preserved the jolt in songs that have kept alive 1980's thrash metal. As Phil Anselmo veered between lashing out and preaching anarchic revolution, the songs trudged along, then raced, or used a third gear, a blues shuffle akin to Pantera's fellow Texans, ZZ Top. The songs had a rugged, bullheaded power, underlined by the crowd response Mr. Anselmo received with effusive gratitude; he might be hostile to the outside world, but not to fans.</p>
        <p>Godsmack tries to follow through on Mr. Osbourne's kind of metal, adding a little grunge self-loathing in slow-riffing songs about sickness and fear. They heaved and thudded dramatically, but added nothing to the legacy of Black Sabbath and Godsmack's other obvious model, the latter-day Metallica.</p>
        <p>Beyond the headliners, hip-hop was ubiquitous at Ozzfest. Mr. Osbourne now presides over a festival that has less and less to do with his kind of heavy metal.</p>
        <p>Barriers between heavy metal and other genres have crumbled as bands turbo-charged metal with the speed of punk and hardcore, then realized that hip-hop held the same noisy, defiant impulses.</p>
        <p>With rap-metal bands like Limp Bizkit and Rage Against the Machine now selling millions of albums, the newer bands on the Ozzfest bill all incorporate hip-hop elements. Vocalists rap as well as sing; bands deploy disc jockeys, drum machines and samples.</p>
        <p>Ozzfest's early hours had more than a few bands simply riding the rap-metal bandwagon. P.O.D., a Christian rap-metal band whose initials stand for Payable on Death, did a capable imitation of Rage Against the Machine, punching out guitar chords while Sonny rapped, ''Spread  his love is the master plan'': Marcos, on guitar, screamed at strategic moments to maximize the stimulation. It was the day's only set that didn't constantly use four-letter words.</p>
        <p>Pitchshifter found crisp, efficient grooves to put across messages of resistance to media brainwashing. Reveille emulated both Rage's music and its righteousness; Primer 55 used rap-metal for anger and boasts. Shuvel, with two nasal rappers, tried to split the difference between Rage Against the Machine and the early Beastie Boys.</p>
        <p>Methods of Mayhem, an attempt at rap-metal by Tommy Lee of Motley Crue, was ignored and then booed by listeners. Static-X had a different variation: chanted lyrics driven by a fast drum machine. Unfortunately, Ministry had the same idea in the 1980's, with better songs.</p>
        <p>Even bands that dispensed melodies had a hip-hop side. Disturbed, whose lead singer, David Draiman, arrived in a straitjacket, jumped between rapping and crooning in skillful songs that revolved around suddenly discovering violent, dangerous impulses in oneself -- metaphors to address puberty and adolescent identity crises. Incubus, Taproot and Deadlights also raised melodies above choppy guitars; Incubus brought considerable variety to its music.</p>
        <p>But not as much as Queens of the Stone Age, the only Ozzfest band to reveal a sense of humor. Its songs romped through bouncy new wave riffs carrying sardonic lists of drugs; dropped back to grinding heavy-metal chords and floated into passages of overlapping guitars that verged on the psychedelic.</p>
        <p>Soulfly, true to the hardcore-heavy metal fusion, churned out guitar riffs and bellowed blunt messages like ''Leave me alive/Leave me alone.'' Kittie, a four-woman band (and Ozzfest's only female performers), set out to crunch and howl like a male hardcore band, but with variations; after barking verses in a throat-tearing shout, Morgan Lander sometimes turned to vulnerable melodies.</p>
        <p>And where the other bands aimed most of their gripes at faceless antagonists, Kittie probed romantic wreckage and the loss of self-esteem. They were applying metal's self-affirming animosity to a target close at hand.</p>
