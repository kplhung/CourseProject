        <p>The stadium has a major league feel, with pounding music and concessionaires hawking peanuts. And the lineup certainly has a major league sound, with names like Bonds, Canseco, Encarnacion, Berry, Heredia and Chambliss.</p>
        <p>When the Newark Bears take the field, however, it is not Barry Bonds and Jose Canseco playing key roles; it is Bobby Bonds Jr. and Ozzie Canseco. The Bears, in their third season in the independent Atlantic League, have six relatives of current or former major leaguers on their roster.</p>
        <p>Bonds is the youngest son of Bobby Bonds and the brother of the future Hall of Famer Barry Bonds. Canseco is the twin brother of Jose, now with Tampa Bay. Third baseman Mike Berry's brother Sean Berry has played for five major league teams, most recently Boston, who designated him for assignment yesterday. Wilson Heredia, a right-hander, has two brothers, the Cubs' Felix HEREDIA and Oakland's Gil Heredia, pitching in the big leagues. And Russ Chambliss, an outfielder, is the son of the former Yankee Chris Chambliss.</p>
        <p>The Bears' catcher, Angelo Encarnacion, a cousin of the Tigers' budding star Juan Encarnacion, had his contract sold to the Boston Red Sox yesterday and will report to Class AAA Pawtucket.</p>
        <p>Like their teammates on the Bears, those six share the same goal: making it to the major leagues. For some, however, there is also the goal of establishing their own identities, separate from those of their more famous relatives.</p>
        <p>At 36, Ozzie Canseco, who had three big league stints with Oakland and St. Louis, is having a career year, of sorts. The first baseman-designated hitter is hitting .316 with 30 home runs and 86 runs batted in in a league that Newark Manager Tom O'Malley said was comparable to Class AAA in its hitting with Class AA pitching, and with a cozy left-field fence that is 306 feet down the line at Newark's Riverfront Stadium.</p>
        <p>Still, Canseco, who was drafted as a pitcher by the Yankees and did not start hitting regularly until he tore a rotator cuff in 1986 is hoping to get back to the majors.</p>
        <p>''As long as I still have a desire to play baseball, I'll keep trying,'' Canseco said.</p>
        <p>Canseco said living up to Jose's stardom has never been a psychological problem on the field, but as a young player there were more personal effects.</p>
        <p>''I was overwhelmed by being treated based on what Jose did,'' he said, staring off, still showing the pain of those days. ''If Jose hit two home runs that day, I was greeted with smiles. If Jose got a speeding ticket the next week, I was greeted with sighs.''</p>
        <p>Bobby Bonds Jr. gave up baseball at 12 because it was not challenging enough.</p>
        <p>''Hitting a home run every day wasn't fun,'' said Bonds, now in his ninth year of professional ball. ''I saw a Bruce Lee movie, and seeing him beat up 300 guys looked like a lot more fun, especially with two older brothers beating me up all the time.'' (The middle brother, Ricky, is not in baseball.)</p>
        <p>After a spring training visit with Barry in 1990, Bonds rediscovered joy in baseball.</p>
        <p>''It took me a long time to learn how to hit, and I'm still learning,'' said Bonds, who is struggling with a .249 average and two home runs this season. ''With the pressure of my name and my brother, people were expecting me to hit, back then, 30 home runs. And I tried to do it. I made my swing real long. And I did it for years. I was real stubborn.''</p>
        <p>Russ Chambliss, more angular than his father, was a 54th-round draft pick of the Yankees in 1997. But the 25-year-old outfielder has bitter memories.</p>
        <p>''I wasted three years not getting a chance to play,'' said Chambliss, who is hitting .269 in his most extensive playing time. ''My name hurt my career. Because of my name everyone thought the only reason I was there was because of who my father was.''</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, Canseco became the Bears' career home run leader with his 29th and second of the game. The crowd of 3,128 chanted ''Ozzie! Ozzie!'' until he went out for a reluctant, almost bashful curtain call. For one moment, at least, one of the Bears had escaped the shadow.</p>
        <p>CLASS A BALANCING ACT</p>
        <p>The Class A South Atlantic League will have new teams in Lexington, Ky., and Wilmington, N.C., for the 2001 season, while the Class A advanced Florida State League will see franchises in St. Petersburg and Kissimmee cease to operate.</p>
        <p>The moves will leave each level of play with 30 teams, providing each major league organization with the opportunity to have one farm team at each level.</p>
        <p>SPINNING TURNSTILES</p>
        <p>The Express of Round Rock, Tex., broke the Texas League attendance record last week when a crowd of 9,623 at the Dell Diamond brought the team's total to 415,834 through 44 home dates. The San Antonio Missions had held the record of 411,959, set with 67 home games in 1994.</p>
