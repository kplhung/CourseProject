        <p>The proposed national missile defense system cannot succeed unless the United States persuades its NATO allies to drop their opposition, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said today.</p>
        <p>For the antimissile shield to protect all 50 states, at a potential cost of $60 billion, it must rely on radar stations abroad, Mr. Cohen said, most likely in Britain and in Greenland, which is territory of Denmark.</p>
        <p>Just weeks before he is to make a recommendation to President Clinton on whether to proceed with the system, Mr. Cohen said a top priority must be to persuade NATO allies to embrace the project. But many of the allies have voiced serious concern that the plan could upset the nuclear balance or set off a new global arms race.</p>
        <p>''In order to have a technologically effective system, we need to have the support of our allies,'' Mr. Cohen said. Without x-band radars overseas, he added, ''You can't see the missiles coming. Therefore, your interceptors really are not worth very much.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen's remarks to the Senate Armed Services Committee were his first since the failure on July 8 of a high-speed missile interceptor to deploy properly. Of the three tests of the intercept system carried out so far, that was the second failure for the system, which relies on a high-tech web of targeting radar, homing sensors and communications links.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen hinted that the two test failures might slow the entire deployment process. The setbacks ''called into question the realism'' of having a system in place by the target date of 2005. But he said the date should remain a goal for a limited shield of 20 interceptors and the x-band radar.</p>
        <p>Virtually all the principal American allies in Europe and Asia oppose the missile defense system. They argue that its efficacy is unproven and that it could undermine the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which has been a mainstay of global arms control since 1972. Those allies also worry that the plan could encourage China and some other nations to beef up their limited long-range arsenals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen told senators that administration officials are gradually breaking through that opposition, though no nation has asked to join the system, and only Australia has expressed support for it.</p>
        <p>The allies share the threat that the American system is designed to address, Mr. Cohen said: long-range missile attacks from such nations as North Korea, Iran and Iraq.</p>
        <p>If NATO allies embrace the project, he predicted, Russia will feel compelled to drop its opposition to amending the ABM treaty. ''Thus far,'' he said, ''I believe the Russians have devoted themselves to trying to divide the allies from supporting the United States.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen acknowledged that Mr. Clinton has failed to persuade Moscow that the missile shield would not neutralize Russia's arsenal. The defense secretary said President Vladimir V. Putin's proposal to work with NATO on a defense that intercepts missiles in the initial boost phase of flight ''cannot be a substitute'' for the antimissile shield and would rely on even less proven technology.</p>
        <p>He also said China will probably increase its intercontinental missile ability regardless of whether the United States proceeds on missile defense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is expected to decide this year whether to break ground on the project. Troubled by Defense Department predictions that North Korea could develop missiles able to reach the United States by 2005, Congress last year approved a law requiring deployment of a missile defense system as soon as it was technologically feasible.</p>
        <p>''Russia and other nations must understand that the United States policy now calls for an eventual deployment of a system to protect ourselves,'' said Senator John Warner, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.</p>
        <p>Rather than decide on full-scale deployment, Mr. Clinton will limit his decision to whether to begin construction next spring of a radar station on Shemya island in Alaska, Mr. Cohen said. That would leave it to the next president to determine the scope of the project, he said. Vice President Gore generally supports the Clinton approach, while George W. Bush, the presumed Republican candidate, favors a more robust system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton might leave to his successor the contentious issue of withdrawing from the ABM treaty, a move that requires a notice of six months from either side. Administration lawyers argue that the United States will not be in violation of the treaty until crews lay the rails for the radar system, which is not expected until March 2002.</p>
        <p>Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who wants to defer the decision to permit more study, anticipated that debate. ''A unilateral decision to withdraw from the ABM treaty could unleash an offensive arms race and create major new proliferation problems,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen said the administration is determined to deprive hostile nations of the ability to blackmail the United States with the threat of a missile attack. He downplayed overtures by the North Korean government to negotiate terms to end its long-range missile program and the historic June meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea.</p>
        <p>Referring to Kim Jong Il of North Korea, Mr. Cohen observed: ''One summit doesn't change the tiger into a domestic cat.''</p>
