        <p>As Representative Robert D. Franks gets his campaign for the United States Senate from New Jersey up to speed, the liberal Democrat he says he is running against is beginning to sound like someone named Hillary Rodham Corzine.</p>
        <p>At a news conference here on Monday, Mr. Franks said Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic nominee, was trying to bring back Hillary Rodham Clinton's failed health care reform plan, and he attacked both Mr. Corzine and Mrs. Clinton as ''celebrity candidates'' trying to fool voters with fancy television commercials.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Franks sent out 100,000 fund-raising letters citing Mrs. Clinton as one of the liberals ''New Jersey can't afford.'' Tonight, he joined  Mrs. Clinton's opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, at a New Jersey fund-raiser for both men.</p>
        <p>After the June 6 primary, advisers to Mr. Corzine said he would attack Representative Franks by linking his most conservative votes to the former House speaker, Newt Gingrich. He has yet to do so, however.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Franks has found his own Newt Gingrich, it seems, and she is just across the Hudson.</p>
        <p>''I don't think voters know Jon Corzine as well as they know Hillary,'' said Candace L. Straight, Mr. Franks's finance chairwoman. ''But we've had eight years of Hillary. She's a national figure, she has a record, and she has a very liberal agenda. And from what I can see and watch of Jon Corzine, he's to the left of Hillary.''</p>
        <p>Stephen Salmore, a Republican strategist and retired Rutgers professor, noted that although Mrs. Clinton had tried to link Mr. Lazio to Mr. Gingrich, she soon abandoned that approach. But turning that tactic against her could work for Mr. Franks, Mr. Salmore said.</p>
        <p>''He's trying to define himself,'' Mr. Salmore said. ''He can't say he's not Corzine, because nobody knows who Corzine is. So he's not Hillary. And unlike Newt Gingrich, Hillary not only hasn't lost her power as an icon, she's going to be in everyone's face.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Straight said tonight's joint event with Mr. Lazio, a house party in Red Bank, was merely a chance for the two men to tap into each other's donors. ''My mother's maxed out for Bob, so she's bringing her $1,000 check for Rick,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Still, raising Mrs. Clinton's name has become a surefire way to energize conservative donors across the country, as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani found when he raised millions through direct-mail solicitations before quitting the Senate race in New York. And for Mr. Franks, whose opponent can tap into a personal fortune of more than $400 million, every dollar will count.</p>
        <p>The event with Mr. Lazio was expected to produce only about $50,000 for each Republican candidate. A more important test will be on Thursday night, when Mr. Franks holds his first major fund-raiser, a dinner honoring Senator John McCain of Arizona that is expected to draw 500 contributors paying $1,000.</p>
        <p>In his letter to prospective contributors, Mr. Franks styled himself a David taking on a financial Goliath, and freely acknowledged that he has no hope of outspending Mr. Corzine, who spent more than $35 million in the primary alone. ''I don't have to match Jon Corzine's spending dollar-for-dollar,'' he wrote. ''But I do need enough advertising to let voters compare my platform to Jon Corzine's ultraliberal agenda.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, who became known as a shrewd tactician when he led the Republican State Committee, has been looking for ways to make Mr. Corzine's free-spending ways work against him. And on Monday, he appeared to have found one.</p>
        <p>''What we're seeing, both in New York and New Jersey, are two celebrity Senate candidates running campaigns that are based on 30-second television commercials,'' Mr. Franks said. ''Their goal, it seems, is to limit to the greatest extent possible the ability of the press or the public to learn how these candidates think or how their programs would work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Salmore said Mr. Franks was wise to link Mr. Corzine's advertisements to Mrs. Clinton's, since most New Jersey residents will be bombarded with both.</p>
        <p>''He's trying to get people to the point that when they see Corzine's ads, they go, 'Here's the ad again,' '' he said. ''Franks is saying, 'Here's a guy who doesn't know the value of a dollar. He's teamed up with Hillary, who wants to spend your money extravagantly. Just like Hillary, he's cosseted from the press, avoiding debates, and trying to introduce himself to the public solely through TV ads.' ''</p>
        <p>Whether it will work with moderate Republicans, Democrats and the unaffiliated voters who make up nearly three-fifth of the New Jersey electorate, of course, remains to be seen.</p>
        <p>''The 15 percent of the country that really hates Hillary Clinton thinks of her as just a rigid socialist,'' said one Corzine adviser. ''You're just not going to sell that on Jon Corzine, the former C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs.''</p>
