        <p>LAST fall, convinced that it could attract more students if it could just show them what happens in the classroom, Mount Holyoke College tried out a new marketing strategy: it sent professors to three cities to teach hourlong lectures, much like those they would teach back on campus, to prospective applicants.</p>
        <p>At a time when colleges wrangle over who ranks highest on the ''most wired'' list, it seemed like such a quaint idea, almost naive: lure 'em with good teaching.</p>
        <p>But it hooked me. I walked away from the biology lecture wondering not only why, when I looked at colleges in the 1980's, I hadn't considered a women's college, but also why I had not thought more seriously -- that is to say, at all -- about studying science.</p>
        <p>Why not? Because I did as so many other people did, and do: with the wisdom typical of age 16, I chose the ''hot'' school -- so hot that it was pictured on the cover of The New York Times Magazine with the headline ''The Hot School,'' so hot that it didn't accept me, leaving me to scramble for an alternative that worked out, but far from ideally.</p>
        <p>Just punishment, then, that I should be assigned to cover education, a job that means I find myself at least once a week asking why I didn't consider this college or that, depending on whatever program I've just visited, whatever professor or college president I've just interviewed.</p>
        <p>The point is not so much that I should have studied medicine or gone to Mount Holyoke (though I did discover that one dowager left a chunk of her fortune to ensuring the nightly tradition of milk and cookies in the dorms, which I found pretty appealing). The point is that like so many prospective college students, I never thought outside the ''hot'' box.</p>
        <p>Hot has only gotten hotter since I set my sights on Duke, in vain. There are more than 3,000 colleges in the United States. Yet the ''Harvard or bust'' mentality has grown so frenzied that excellent colleges complain that they have to give more financial aid based on merit and less based on need because the only way they can attract good students away from the big names is to buy them.</p>
        <p>I can't help but wonder whether if everyone did for a living what I now do -- or at least the parents and students out touring colleges this summer -- people might be less obsessed with the hot school and more interested in what schools work best for them.</p>
        <p>The first thing they'd realize is how many interesting things are happening at so many different colleges. How about a place where the college president still teaches class, engagingly so? A place where alumni barons of the new economy come back to lecture in small seminars about what they've learned? A place with strong mentoring? A place that demands that students learn to write and speak well, whether they major in engineering or English? A state college that affords you the opportunity to take courses as well at the most exclusive liberal arts college in the nation, while paying less than $10,000 a year? These are all things happening at good colleges whose names aren't among the five or so hot schools that every student in the country seems to want to attend.</p>
        <p>They might also see that hot is a pretty empty concept, based mostly on rankings that in themselves are fairly arbitrary. The most popular guides devise rankings based on the number of alumni donations, the number of students per faculty member, the number of applications rejected. Some schools have explicitly said they shape their budgets to make themselves look better in rankings. Others assemble teams of staff members specifically to figure out how to list information in a way that will lift the ranking; they can dance on the head of a pin to find the most flattering definition of ''faculty'' or ''alumni.'' Which is better, a school that's figured out how to ace the rankings, or one that serves students well?</p>
        <p>If I were going to do it all over again, knowing what I have learned from colleges across the country, I would consider the larger state schools, and smaller strong liberal arts colleges in the Midwest. I would sit in on classes, and not just English classes, but physics classes, too. As that lecture last fall taught me, a professor's ability to intrigue the uninitiated is a good indication of how dedicated a college is to teaching.</p>
        <p>I would remember that college is about exploring your options, and look for a place strongly encouraging that. I would remember, too, that college is what you make of it, no matter where you are.</p>
        <p>It's become easy to say that professors at research universities don't do enough teaching. That, too, isn't always true; I've met plenty of professors and deans at Harvard who care about individual students. But these aren't the schools for everyone. The trick, as guidance counselors try to convince their students every year, isn't to get into the best college. It's to find the best college for you.</p>
