        <p>For Mr. Bush, the sale of an ownership stake in the Texas Rangers baseball team netted a profit of $14.9 million two years ago, from an investment of $606,000 nine years before.

        <p>The business climate of Texas -- entrepreneurial, energy-based and big -- has been lucrative for both George W. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Bush, the sale of an ownership stake in the Texas Rangers baseball team netted a profit of $14.9 million two years ago, from an investment of $606,000 nine years before. And with a legendary Texas financier, Richard E. Rainwater, as his investment adviser, Mr. Bush has had investment income of more than $1 million a year in the last two years, in addition to his $115,345 salary as Texas governor.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Cheney, the numbers are even bigger. In 1995, when he became chief executive of the Halliburton Company, a Dallas oil services company, he received an annual salary and bonus of $1.3 million to $3 million, along with stock options and Halliburton shares.</p>
        <p>According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Cheney owns 1,089,000 shares of Halliburton, including shares he owns outright and 860,000 options to purchase shares at a reduced price. With Halliburton trading at around $40 a share, his stake has a market value of around $40 million, although he would net somewhat less than that depending on the financial terms of the options.</p>
        <p>Just this year, when Halliburton stock was trading at a 52-week high, Mr. Cheney sold 100,000 shares at $50.97 a share. That transaction, on May 31, took place just before Halliburton stock began to tumble.</p>
