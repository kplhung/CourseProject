        <p>LET'S say that a business executive from Greenwich, Conn., is making his daily journey into New York City, and on the walk from Grand Central Terminal to his office in Midtown, his cell phone rings.</p>
        <p>The call informs him that his company has been sold to a Euro-behemoth, and his duties are about to be shifted to Liechtenstein. The shock is so great that it causes this fellow to collapse on the street just as he is telling a curbside vendor to give him his usual light coffee and prune danish.</p>
        <p>What should the New York Fire Department do when it hears that a man is down in Midtown:</p>
        <p>(a) Rush over to administer CPR, T.L.C. and all other applicable initials? Or</p>
        <p>(b) Let him lie there once they check his wallet and see that he is a commuter?</p>
        <p>Obviously, the correct answer is (a). But (b) sure is tempting, given how Albany's legislative sages, the governor and the courts have all decided that our man from Greenwich need not pay a penny's worth of income tax to the city that made it possible for him to live in a gilded suburb. Not a penny to help keep the Fire Department in shape to save his life at the drop of a prune danish.</p>
        <p>We are a few weeks into the city's new fiscal year. This is the second year without a commuter tax, which had been a pillar of regional governance since 1966.</p>
        <p>It turns out that the disappearance of this minuscule income tax, amounting to less than one-half of 1 percent, is pinching the five boroughs even more than initially thought when legislative leaders and Gov. George E. Pataki conspired to get rid of it in the spring of 1999. (Mr. Pataki and the lawmakers, who normally have trouble agreeing on a lunch order, managed to move so fast to eliminate this tax that they practically gave themselves whiplash.)</p>
        <p>Estimates in 1999 were that their action -- rooted in banal party politics, mind you, and divorced from any grand fiscal strategy -- would cost New York City $360 million a year. If only we could get off that cheaply! The city's Independent Budget Office now projects a $475 million loss for this new fiscal year, a figure expected to keep growing, to $556 million in 2004.</p>
        <p>Quick translation: this hurts. It hurts even more when Albany makes life extra tough for city budget makers, as it just did by forcing them to make pension payments that will cost more than half a billion dollars a year. As a result, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani now talks about scaling back tax cuts for city residents that he and the City Council approved.</p>
        <p>''People don't understand the effects of this,'' said Peter F. Vallone, the Council speaker. By people, he meant suburbanites. They need to recognize, Mr. Vallone said, that a basic principle of equity is at stake: that those who make their money in one place and cart it away to another have a duty to pay back a tiny piece of it.</p>
        <p>Besides, this particular tax was so small that no commuter ever lodged a complaint with the Council, the speaker said. For someone with a taxable income of $70,000, the burden was $315 a year. That came to a mere 86 cents a day to help sustain a city whose health is obviously critical to those who depend on it for their livelihood, whether they live here or not.</p>
        <p>''The City of New York is the central business district for the entire New York State,'' Mr. Vallone said. Ronnie Lowenstein, acting director of the Independent Budget Office, added, ''To think of it as us versus them ultimately hurts everybody.''</p>
        <p>WHAT can be done to reverse last year's mistake? Right now, not much. In an election year, who in Albany is about to call for reimposing a discarded tax?</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giuliani's office says the mayor is prepared to do what he can to unseat state senators and Assembly members from the city who supported the commuter-tax repeal. What that means in practical terms is not clear. Mr. Giuliani has a history of putting on kid gloves when it comes to a central player in this drama: the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who represents the Lower East Side yet did nothing to protect his city's interests.</p>
        <p>To former Mayor Edward I. Koch, Mr. Silver is guilty of no less than ''treason of the highest magnitude.'' Not that Mr. Koch holds other state legislators in much higher regard. ''You can buy them cheap, with a dinner,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For now, Mr. Silver is probably safe. So is that commuter from Greenwich. His bosses may desert him, but New Yorkers won't. They'll be there to pick him up when he falls. And they'll then pick up the tab for it.</p>
