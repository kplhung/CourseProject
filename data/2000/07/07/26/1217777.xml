        <p>BRITAIN: NANNY'S PARENTS CLEARED  The parents of Louise Woodward, a former nanny who was convicted in Massachusetts for the second degree murder of a baby in her care, were cleared of trying to defraud an appeal fund set up for their daughter. Judge John Roberts ordered jurors in Chester to find Gary and Susan Woodward, both 44, not guilty of defrauding the fund of more than $13,500, saying the prosecution failed to prove some of the money in the fund was not donated solely for the parents' use. The conviction of Louise Woodward, now 22, was later downgraded to manslaughter and she was freed after serving 279 days in jail.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: NUCLEAR PLANT CANCELED  Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit canceled plans for Turkey's first nuclear plant, saying the $5 billion facility would have imposed a heavy economic burden at a time when the government is fighting a deficit. Environmental groups had warned that the proposed location of the plant, on the southern Mediterranean coast near Mersin, was near an earthquake fault.</p>

        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: REPORTER ON TRIAL  A Serbian journalist who reported allegations of Yugoslav Army atrocities in Kosovo last year went before a military court charged with espionage and spreading false information. Miroslav Filipovic, who worked as a correspondent for the Belgrade-based independent daily Danas and for Agence France-Presse, has been detained since May 22. If found guilty he faces up to 20 years in jail.</p>

        <p>THE VATICAN: AN APPEAL TO VIRGINA  John Paul II has asked the governor of Virginia to stop the execution of Rocco Barnabei, 33, who is on death row for the 1994 murder of his fiancee, the Vatican said. Mr. Barnabei's mother, Jane Barnabei, met with Vatican officials last week.</p>

        <p>CHILE: PINOCHET MEDICAL TESTS BLOCKED  In a setback to Gen. Augusto Pinochet's efforts to avoid trial on human rights charges, the Supreme Court refused to allow medical tests that could have exempted the 84-year-old former dictator from court proceedings. The court also delayed a decision on whether to strip General Pinochet of his congressional immunity.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: REBELS CLAIM ATTACK  A guerrilla group claimed responsibility for an attack on a roadside office of the federal police outside Mexico City that left one officer with minor wounds and two children with cuts from flying glass. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of the People said in a statement that the attack was meant to show that insurrection remained a valid strategy despite the governing party's defeat in presidential voting.</p>

        <p>CANADA: PLAN FOR WATER SYSTEM  Two months after a deadly strain of E. coli bacteria killed at least 7 people and sickened 2,000 in Walkerton, Ontario, provincial environmental officials have abandoned attempts to clean the town's water system and will replace 5.5 miles of water pipes. The old cast-iron piping ''cannot effectively be swabbed as part of the continuing decontamination program,'' the Environment Ministry said.</p>

        <p>JAPAN: SECT MEMBER SENTENCED TO HANG  A former member of the sect behind the 1995 Tokyo subway nerve gas attack was sentenced to death for an earlier gas attack and for killing a lawyer preparing to sue the sect, a court said. The Tokyo District Court found Satoru Hashimoto, 33, guilty of involvement in a Sarin nerve gas attack in 1995 that killed seven people. Mr. Hashimoto was also convicted of the 1989 strangling deaths of the lawyer, Tsutsumi Sakamoto, his wife and infant son. He is the second former member of the Aumshinri Kyo sect to be sentenced to death for those killings. Kazuaki Okazaki, 39, was sentenced in 1998 but has appealed.</p>

        <p>NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA: REUNITING FAMILIES  South Korea will choose 100 people on Friday to be reunited with their families in North Korea after half a century of separation, Red Cross officials said. Another 100 people from the North will visit the South to meet their families. The reunions follow the meeting in June between the leaders of the two countries, who pledged to seek national reconciliation.</p>

        <p>PAKISTAN, INDIA: KASHMIR CEASE-FIRE CONFIRMED  The leader of one of the most powerful groups fighting Indian rule in the disputed territory of Kashmir, Sayed Salahuddin of the Hizbul Mujahideen, confirmed a cease-fire declaration. The declaration has been welcomed by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India, who said his government was ready for talks, but it has drawn sharp criticism from other militants.</p>

        <p>IVORY COAST: NEW CONSTITUTION  A new Constitution was approved by 86.53 percent of voters, according to final results released by the military government. The turnout was 56 percent. The draft constitution had been endorsed by all major parties, including the Rally of Republicans led by Alassane Ouattara. Many believe its strict nationality rules were intended to exclude Mr. Ouattara from running for president, but Mr. Ouattara, a former prime minister, has said he meets all the requirements to run.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL, LEBANON: BORDER VIOLATIONS CHARGED  A United Nations envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen of Sweden, accused Israel of violating its border with Lebanon. His accusations followed earlier complaints from Lebanese officials that Israel had committed fresh encroachments across the frontier. Plans to deploy United Nations peacekeepers along the border starting on Wednesday were put on hold, an official Lebanese statement said. There was no immediate Israeli comment.</p>
