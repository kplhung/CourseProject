      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Faced with a bank of microphones, the candidate reached not for a canned speech, but for an acoustic guitar.</p>
        <p>''There just has to be more to this life than the will to survive,'' Pat DiNizio sang. ''I believe. I believe. I believe.''</p>
        <p>But a vital question is whether New Jersey voters will believe in Mr. DiNizio, who announced yesterday before a crowd of about 40 reporters, supporters and just plain fans that he was running for the United States Senate as the candidate of the Reform Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiNizio, 44, a political novice with a paunch, whose hairline is in full retreat, is best known as the lead singer, songwriter and driving force behind the Smithereens, a power-pop foursome whose nine albums have sold, by Mr. DiNizio's account, six million copies during the last two decades. The band's angst-ridden love song ''Blood and Roses'' was a hit in the late 1980's, and its brooding bass line now reverberates in a Nissan commercial.</p>
        <p>Seeking to fill the rock-star-in-Congress niche left vacant by the 1998 death of Sonny Bono, Mr. DiNizio was anointed last month as the Reform Party's candidate for Senate by the party's former chairman. The current chairman, Joseph Sansone, said today that he was more concerned with electing the party's likely presidential candidate, Patrick J. Buchanan.</p>
        <p>''To be honest with you, I never had an extended conversation'' with Mr. DiNizio, he said. But he added, ''Yeah, he is the candidate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DiNizio's campaign director, Daniel M. Nozza, said the campaign had submitted more than 2,200 petition signatures, qualifying him for a ballot line.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiNizio, who helped forge the vibrant New Brunswick music scene, said he was a local Republican Party committeeman -- the lowest rung on the political ladder -- while a teenager in Scotch Plains.</p>
        <p>''Pat's a pretty bright guy,'' said Bob Albert, owner of the Court Tavern, a venerable New Brunswick club where the Smithereens have performed. ''He was always trying to engage people in some kind of conversation, and it usually was something political.''</p>
        <p>The rock press has taken notice. ''He'll be perfect for the VH1 audience,'' said Kelley Busby, a producer for that music video channel, who was on hand today for Mr. DiNizio's announcement.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiNizio, who wore a blue blazer but no tie, said his political concerns had grown along with his 6-year-old daughter, Liza. But although he decided to run for Senate about a year ago, he would not single out any issue of particular concern or name any legislation he might propose if elected.</p>
        <p>''We'll leave that for later,'' said Mr. DiNizio, who said he disagreed with the conservative positions of Mr. Buchanan on issues like abortion and immigration.</p>
        <p>But he did criticize his two major opponents: Jon S. Corzine, a multimillionaire who Mr. DiNizio said would look out for his own financial interests, and Representative Robert D. Franks, a career politician who he said would look out for contributors'.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiNizio quoted a fallen statesman of rock. ''As Jerry Garcia said, 'Voting for the lesser of two evils is still voting for evil.' ''</p>
