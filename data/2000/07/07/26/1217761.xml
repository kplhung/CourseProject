        <p>A federal jury began deliberations today in the bribery and racketeering trial of the leaders of the International Boxing Federation.</p>
        <p>The jury of seven men and five women received the case against Robert W. Lee , 66, the president and founder of the sanctioning group and his son, Robert Lee Jr., 38, after United States District Court Judge John W. Bissell talked for three hours on legal issues connected to the 34-count indictment.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors have charged that Lee and his son extorted money from boxers, managers and promoters in exchange for ratings that let the fighters get lucrative televised boxing matches and shots at the championship in a range of weight classes. In all, prosecutors allege that $338,000 in bribes were paid over 15 years.</p>
        <p>The key prosecution witness was Colin Douglas Beavers, the former ratings chairman of the I.B.F., who became a government informant in 1997, videotaping and recording conversations and meetings that involved Lee and other boxing figures.</p>
        <p>In the absence of other direct testimony implicating Lee in soliciting or receiving bribes, the defense tried to portray Beavers as the real culprit, someone who was running his own extortion operation.</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers also argued that if money had been received by Lee, it represented gratuities from promoters.</p>
