        <p>More Steak in Midtown</p>
        <p>Steakhouses are proliferating in midtown, west of Rockefeller Center, with newcomers like Del Frisco's Double Eagle and Palm West. The latest addition is a branch of Angelo &amp; Maxie's at 1285 Avenue of the Americas (52nd Street), which was designed, like the original in the Flatiron district, by Morris Nathanson.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of arts and crafts details and lots of cigars, some being sold in a shop where they are hand-rolled, and some being smoked in a downstairs dining room and bar with humidors.</p>
        <p>Angelo &amp; Maxie's is now part of the Chart House chain.</p>
        <p>Spinning Off a Pub</p>
        <p>Jerome O'Connor, who owned St. Dymphnas on St. Mark's Place, has opened the Half King, a cozy pub at 505 West 23rd Street. It is decorated with weathered barn boards and has a bar with booths in one room, a lounge in another and even a little garden in the back.</p>
        <p>His partners include Sebastian Junger, the author of ''The Perfect Storm,'' who was a regular at St. Dymphnas.</p>
        <p>Next week, the Half King will start serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, with the menu featuring what Mr. O'Connor called upscale pub food. Swordfish, perhaps?</p>
        <p>Hollywood Connections</p>
        <p>Thanks to Patrick Fahey's contacts in the movie business, Sugar, his lounge at 311 Church Street (Walker Street), which is to open in mid-September, will have such Hollywood backers as Matt Dillon, Kevin Dillon and David Keith. The decor will be Danish modern and the food will be served in bento boxes.</p>
        <p>Short Orders</p>
        <p>Jean-Georges Vongerichten is about to get his feet wet in the Caribbean. He is the consultant for Dune, a  high-end restaurant to open Sept. 1 in the Ocean Club on Paradise Island in the Bahamas.</p>
        <p>Hampton Chutney, a company that produces chutneys and has an Amagansett cafe that serves soft-filled flatbreads, will open a Manhattan branch at 68 Prince Street (Crosby Street) in the fall.</p>
        <p>Beacon, the restaurant at 25 West 56th Street, where Waldy Malouf specializes in oven-roasted dishes, has opened a branch in Stamford, Conn., at 183 Harbor Drive.</p>
        <p>Marika Somerstein, an owner of Water's Edge in Long Island City, Queens, and Donny Evans, who once owned Bridgehampton Cafe in Bridgehampton, N.Y., plan to open a restaurant at 208 West 70th Street, formerly Mendy's West, in the fall.</p>
