        <p>MOST people who buy Parmigiano-Reggiano never give a thought to the variations in the way it tastes. Even I always assumed the flavor differences had to do with the aging process or the quality of the cheese itself. Parmigiano, after all, always looks the same. Unlike Cheddars and chevres, it doesn't wear a brand name or come in different shapes. It's one cheese, all the time.</p>
        <p>Or so I thought until last week, when I tasted Parmigiano-Reggiano produced in fall, winter, spring and summer side by side. I was amazed at how distinctive each one was: sharp or sweet or herbaceous, or just intensely buttery like aged cheese. One was not better than another -- they were just different.</p>

        <p>MOST people who buy Parmigiano-Reggiano never give a thought to the variations in the way it tastes. Even I always assumed the flavor differences had to do with the aging process or the quality of the cheese itself. Parmigiano, after all, always looks the same. Unlike Cheddars and chevres, it doesn't wear a brand name or come in different shapes. It's one cheese, all the time.</p>
        <p>Or so I thought until last week, when I tasted Parmigiano-Reggiano produced in fall, winter, spring and summer side by side. I was amazed at how distinctive each one was: sharp or sweet or herbaceous, or just intensely buttery like aged cheese. One was not better than another -- they were just different.</p>
        <p>For only a few weeks in July, DiPalo's Italian specialty market in Little Italy is able to offer these handmade cheeses of all seasons, each two or more years old. The owner, Lou DiPalo, and a few others like Richard Rogers of Rogers International Ltd., an importer of specialty foods in Portland, Me., make a point of searching out cheeses from certain seasons and celebrating their individuality. But they are the exception. Each year, the differences in what is essentially the same cheese become harder to distinguish.</p>
        <p>At a moment when Americans are becoming more interested in nuances in cheese, the people in charge of guarding the sanctity of Parmigiano-Reggiano are working hard to standardize it, to erase the variations that different seasons bring.</p>
        <p>Yet, my tasting session at DiPalo's was eye-opening. The seasonal differences in the cow's milk seemed very definitely to affect the flavor of the finished cheese.</p>
        <p>When the spring cheese, with a slightly pink cast to its delicate yellow center, was cracked open, its delightfully herbaceous quality perfumed the air, though the fragrance dissipated quickly. To me the spring cheese had the most complex flavor. It was drier and more crumbly than the other cheeses. The fall Parmigiano was rich and full-flavored, with a bit of bite at the back of the mouth, the most balanced and polished of the cheeses. The winter, which is lightest in color, was the most delicate and sweet, with a nice mouth feel because it had more butterfat. Mr. DiPalo provided two summer cheeses, both different, one from the hills and one from the plains. These had the deepest golden color, and the one from the mountains had the texture of spring, the taste of summer: sharp with an almost acidic afterbite.</p>
        <p>What they all had in common was a flaky, slightly grainy texture, the famous crunch that comes from the crystallization of the amino acids in the milk as the cheese ages. The older the cheese, the more grainy and crunchy. But a thin sliver of any of the cheeses, held in the mouth, seems to melt.</p>
        <p>While the more pungent Parmigianos are better for filling tortellini or ravioli and for grating, the others are better thinly shaved on top of other ingredients or eaten in chunks out of hand.</p>
        <p>The Consorzio del Formaggio Parmigiano-Reggiano, the industry group that certifies the authenticity of the cheeses, acknowledges the existence of the seasonal variations that Mr. DiPalo celebrates and I perceived, but says they are not as great as they once were because the feeding of the cows has been standardized.</p>
        <p>The consortium insists that most differences in taste are due more to variations in producers. In 1955 the consortium set down regulations governing the way the cheese must be made. Those who don't agree with the consortium say that while it may have gotten rid of the really poor cheeses, it has also gotten rid of the really great ones.</p>
        <p>Until 1984, authentic Parmigiano-Reggiano could be made only between April 15 and Nov. 15. That made from November to April was called vernengo. But changes in the breed of cow, the types of feed and the method of feeding meant that Parmigiano could be made 365 days a year, a fact that the consortium officially acknowledged.</p>
        <p>Today, with a few exceptions in the hills of the region where the cheese is produced, very few cows are out in pastures grazing. Instead, special grasses are grown and fed to them in the barns where they are confined. Because the feed is the same for almost all the cows, the cheese is far more uniform than anything available before the regulations were set down.</p>
        <p>Even so, many professionals can discern differences. Robert Kaufelt, who owns Murray's Cheese in Greenwich Village, says he has come to understand that the seasons do make a difference.</p>
        <p>''I did a tasting, and winter cheese is better than summer,'' he said. Lou Todaro, who owns Todaro Brothers, buys only winter Parmigiano-Reggiano, which he also thinks is the best.</p>
        <p>But Richard Rogers of Rogers International buys spring and fall cheeses only. ''We deal with cows that graze only on natural grasses,'' he said. ''We emphasize a very narrow niche.'' Mr. Rogers has also been buying some of the very small production from the Razza Reggiana breed of cows, which used to provide the milk for all Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. The milk of the Razza Reggiana, or vacca rossa (red cow), is much richer and higher in protein, and the cheese can be aged much longer than that from the current herds of Frisona Italiana, which are the progeny of Dutch Holsteins. Red cow Parmigiano is also about 80 percent more expensive, Mr. Rogers said.</p>
        <p>Even chefs are often aware of seasonal differences. At Frank, a trattoria in the East Village, Frank Prisinzano serves a plate of two to four different seasonal Parmigiano-Reggianos with figs, peaches or pears. And at Peasant, an Italian restaurant in NoLIta, Frank DeCarlo prefers the spring and winter cheeses and matches them with food.</p>
        <p>Max McCalman, who is in charge of the cheeses at Picholine, prefers the summer cheeses, although he finds any Parmigiano-Reggiano a hard sell on his cheese board because diners presume to know the cheese already.</p>
        <p>But Mario Batali, the chef at Babbo, does not see much difference among the cheeses. ''In a blind tasting I can't tell which season is which,'' he said. ''Spring cheese tastes more herbaceous, but that's all I'm prepared to say.''</p>
        <p>Parmigiano-Reggiano, a raw milk cheese, has been made for at least 700 years in a region of northern Italy that consists of the provinces of Parma, Modena, Reggio Emilia and parts of Bologna and Mantua. The district where Parmigiano is made has about 9,000 dairies and about 600 cheese makers. The only ingredients in the cheese are milk, rennet and salt. The entire rind of each wheel of authentic Parmigiano is imprinted with the name as the cheese is being shaped, as well as the month and the year. Cheeses are aged 18 months to three years, sometimes longer.</p>
        <p>''I have nothing but good things to say about the consorzio that protects the quality of Parmigiano-Reggiano,'' Pamela Sheldon Johns writes in ''Italian Food Artisans'' (Chronicle Books, $24.95). ''But with big business comes standardization. More and more dairies are forming cooperatives, and the independent dairyman-cheese maker is becoming rare. With the disappearance of the individual artisan goes some of the distinct differences evident in the past, such as floral qualities in a mountain spring cheese, or the rich, pungent character in a plains-produced autumn cheese.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Johns goes on to say that fortunately, variations still persist, because it is impossible to standardize artisanal products so they always look and taste exactly the same, like Velveeta.</p>
        <p>In an introduction to a 1998 cookbook produced by the consortium, Lynne Rossetto Kasper, an expert on Italian food, says: ''The secrets of Parmigiano-Reggiano's quality are found in its inconsistencies. In a world of mass-produced sameness this cheese is made by hand, usually only 8 or 12 wheels at a time.''</p>
        <p>''Topography also plays a role,'' she says, and ''cheeses from the hills and cheeses from the plains are never quite alike.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview last week, Ms. Kasper was not quite so complimentary, contending that the consortium had narrowed the range of quality. ''Before 10 or 15 years ago there was lousy cheese, middle-road cheese, high-good cheese and extraordinary cheese,'' she said. ''In the 70's, it was not unusual to taste something pretty special, and it was easy to find. The consorzio got rid of the stuff at the bottom and discouraged the extraordinary stuff, concentrating on the high good. They saw a market that couldn't tell the difference between high good and extraordinary. I think the quality has definitely gone down, and I think it was stupid, because it commands a premium price and there are so many alternative cheeses for people to buy today.''</p>
        <p>But the consortium maintains that standardization is necessary to improve the bottom line. ''Americans and northern Europeans equate consistency with quality,'' said Nancy Radke, the director of communications for the consortium in the United States. ''It is counter to artisan products, but in this industrialized world this is a fact of life. There is a certain sadness that some of that variation is lost, and with the European Union rules for hygiene, cheese like this will become an endangered species.''</p>
        <p>Mario Zannoni, a sensory analyst for the department of quality control for the consortium, defends the standardization. ''The consorzio has reached a reasonably good quality,'' he said. ''A portion of the production is considered very good. I'm not sure we had extraordinary cheese before. I think we had very good cheese.</p>
        <p>''There is less variation between the seasons because of the feeding standardizations. There is still an effect of the seasons and of the ripening, but it is less than before. The variations are connected more with the cheese factory than the seasons.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DiPalo, however, maintains that the seasons are the primary reason for the differences and that the cheeses he chooses celebrate the differences. ''I know,'' he said, ''because I have cut thousands of pounds of cheese.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DiPalo, whose family has been selling Italian delicacies since 1925, is happy to acknowledge that he is a dinosaur. ''I'm very traditional,'' he said, ''and I've taken it upon myself to search out seasonal changes. It's an art that requires a lot of time and patience on my part and the part of those who buy for me.''</p>
        <p>The movement to bring back the vacca rossa may be to his benefit. Since 1990 a group of 10 breeders have been making cheese exclusively with this milk, and Mr. DiPalo is expecting a shipment of their cheese shortly.</p>
        <p>''The consorzio is making a big mistake conforming to the plastic world,'' he said. ''They are telling you this is what you like, this is what you are going to eat, but I'm going to continue to look for cheeses with different characteristics.''</p>
        <p>Judging A Cheese By Its Rind</p>
        <p>EVEN if you cannot choose Parmigiano-Reggiano by the season, here are some rules for getting the best available and storing it properly:</p>
        <p>Look for the date and year the cheese was made, imprinted on the rind. If the rind has ''X'' marks, the cheese has been rejected by regulators because it did not meet their standards.</p>
        <p>Never buy grated Parmigiano-Reggiano: it loses its flavor. If you grate cheese, use it within a week.</p>
        <p>Buy cheese that has been cracked into wedges, rather than sliced, which changes the texture.</p>
        <p>Cheese should have a crisp but not very dry texture; the color is not indicative of quality or taste.</p>
        <p>Ask for cheese that has been stored either at the proper aging temperature or in a refrigerated case. At home, remove the plastic wrap and let the cheese sit at room temperature for a few minutes; then rewrap it with plastic film and cover with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Change the wrap every time the cheese is used, or at least once a week. Keep the cheese in the refrigerator.</p>
        <p>If a piece of cheese has become old and dry, wrap it in a moistened cheesecloth, cover with aluminum foil and refrigerate for a day. Then, rewrap in plastic. If mold develops on the outside, clean it off; otherwise, it will bore through the cheese and spoil it.</p>
        <p>If you use the rinds to add flavor to minestrone or chicken soup, wash the outside first.</p>

        <p>Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter: A Quartet to Make Vivaldi Sing</p>
        <p>IF you want to experiment with seasonal variations in Parmigiano-Reggiano, here are tips from Lou DiPalo of DiPalo's and Frank DeCarlo, the owner and chef of Peasant:</p>
        <p>Top buttered steamed asparagus with shaved spring Parmigiano-Reggiano, and run it under the broiler to melt and brown the cheese.</p>
        <p>Top paper-thin slices of bres aola with shaved winter Parmigiano-Reggiano on a bed of arugula; drizzle with extra virgin olive oil.</p>
        <p>Add grated summer Parmigiano-Reggiano to a frittata with onions and peppers.</p>
        <p>Top very thin slices of prosciutto with slightly thicker slices of winter Parmigiano-Reggiano over baby dandelion greens, and serve with fresh figs drizzled with olive oil.</p>
        <p>As for complementary wines, Mr. DiPalo recommends Chianti or merlot for fall Parmigiano-Reggiano, prosecco or pinot bianco from Friuli for winter cheese, Dolcetto d'Alba for spring cheese. Summer cheese is not good for eating out of hand.</p>
