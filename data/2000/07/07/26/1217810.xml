        <p>The aggressive expansion of pesticide spraying in New York this week, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's comments that some local species, including some fish, could become casualties of war in fighting the West Nile virus, have raised new concerns among environmentalists that the region's fragile ecosystem could fall victim to the anxiety over public health.</p>
        <p>But even the harshest critics of the spraying program concede that there has been little conclusive evidence so far to back up their fears.</p>
        <p>Like pesticide spray itself, which drifts on the wind to kill airborne insects, then dissipates, the hints and suggestions of broader environmental impact are impossible to pin down, the experts say. Especially within New York City, where every species has to confront an array of environmental assaults, from poor air quality to polluted water, determining the relative effect of the latest toxin in town is a difficult science.</p>
        <p>And with city and state resources committed first and foremost to fighting the virus, there has also been little political initiative to even begin such an analysis.</p>
        <p>''There's a grossly inadequate effort to track the collateral impact on the environment and on humans,'' said William Cooke, a spokesman for the National Audubon Society in New York. ''We should have dozens of people who are trained in the field to be out there logging the effects, and that's not happening.''</p>
        <p>Even the few observations that have become part of the public record are in dispute.</p>
        <p>State wildlife officials concluded last fall, for example, that the city's pesticide program, then using the pesticide malathion, was responsible for the deaths of several hundred small sun fish in Clove Lake on Staten Island. City environmental officials said, however, that ordinary filth might have been the culprit -- a raw sewage leak into the lake at the same time made the post-mortem conclusions unclear, according to a report by the city's Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
        <p>Many city residents also reported seeing numerous dead butterflies, bees and beetles last year during the time when the city was spraying for mosquitoes, according to the National Audubon Society. But without a study, those deaths remained unexplained observations. Butterfly populations are down again this year, but the causes are just as unclear.</p>
        <p>''I think it has more to do with a wet spring, or changes in climate, because they're also down in New Hampshire, and they didn't spray there,'' said Guy Tudor, president of the New York City Butterfly Club.</p>
        <p>Some pesticide experts argue that the lack of knowledge about the long-term impact of spraying in a dense urban environment -- for both human and nonhuman species -- is as big a story as West Nile itself. But officials around the country who have been battling other mosquito-borne diseases say that knowledge is hard won and comes only with time.</p>
        <p>In Harris County, Texas, for example, which includes the city of Houston, mosquito-control officials have assembled a 25-year database about when and where and under what conditions of rainfall and temperature the St. Louis virus has emerged. That has allowed the county to concentrate its efforts and sharply reduce both aerial and ground spraying for mature mosquitoes over time.</p>
        <p>Other experts who are watching the New York experience closely, especially in southern states along the migratory bird routes that many biologists believe could be the pathway for the virus's eventual spread, said that New York might have resorted to spraying too soon or too aggressively, but that no one really knew for sure.</p>
        <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in particular, has pushed the city toward an aggressive attack on the virus.</p>
        <p>''They don't know enough about West Nile yet, and the C.D.C. doesn't know enough about how it circulates,'' said Fred Santana, the Integrated Pest Management Coordinator for Sarasota County, Florida. ''I know I'd hate to be in their position,'' he said, referring to New York's health officials.</p>
        <p>Critics of pesticide use say that there are also issues of human health from exposure to the chemicals used in the West Nile battle that are not being adequately explored or discussed with the public by officials.</p>
        <p>Several medical studies have said, for instance, that the class of chemicals now being used by the city, called synthetic pyrethroids -- sold under the brand names Anvil and Scourge -- may interfere with endocrine and immune systems in humans, according to a report earlier this year by Environmental Advocates, an Albany-based consumer and environmental group.</p>
        <p>Chronic exposure to resmethrin, which is the active ingredient in Scourge, has also been linked to effects on the human liver and thyroid, the report said. But the Environmental Protection Agency's lead pesticide official said those studies were not conclusive and that the substances being used in the New York region were among the safest on the market.</p>
        <p>Anvil has been used in Nassau and Westchester Counties. Connecticut, which was scheduled to begin its first mosquito-spraying program of the season last night in parts of Stamford, Darien and New Canaan, is using Scourge.</p>
        <p>''Our first concern is public health protection, but based on what we know, we're not seeing any human health issues in any of this class of synthetic pyrethroids,'' said Stephen L. Johnson, an E.P.A. deputy assistant administrator in charge of pesticides.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year the E.P.A. said that the chemical used around New York last year, malathion, posed no threat to people when used with proper spraying procedures and concentration, although there was ''suggestive evidence'' that high doses of the chemical could cause cancer in laboratory animals. Next month, however, the agency will conduct what pesticide experts say is a rare public review of its own decision-making about malathion when it holds a two-day peer review session with independent scientists who are expected to hear evidence from some of the agency's own researchers suggesting that the chemical is more carcinogenic that the earlier report had indicated.</p>
        <p>The initial malathion review was conducted under the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act, which required the E.P.A. to reassess more than 20,000 pesticides using a much stricter standard of impact -- especially on children -- than had previously been used.</p>
        <p>Agency officials said that they prioritized the work based on preliminary indications of which chemicals were considered most toxic, and that the reassessment of the pyrethroid group -- which includes Anvil and Scourge -- is not scheduled to begin until 2002.</p>
        <p>''Just because a pesticide has a registration number with the E.P.A.  doesn't mean it's been fully evaluated,'' said Jay Feldman, executive director of National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides, a Washington environmental group. ''People don't know that.''</p>
