        <p>Mooney Pottie (her given name is Agnes Marie) is a dreamy, bookish teenager living in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, in the mid-1970's and longing to be anywhere else. Life in her close-knit, conservative small town seems unbearably drab; even the riot of ill-matched plaids that seems to be New Waterford's idea of fashion can't overcome its essential grayness. This is the kind of place where thrift and common sense dictate that a shotgun wedding at the local church double as a funeral, in spite of the inconvenience of sorting out condolence cards from congratulations. No wonder Mooney dreams of Rome, Paris and above all, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago Allan Moyle, who directed this quirky, charming movie from Tricia Fish's eagle-eyed script, made ''Pump Up the Volume,'' a cheerfully incendiary fable of teenage rebellion starring Christian Slater as an insurgent boy disc jockey. While the look and setting of his new picture are different, ''New Waterford Girl,'' which opens today at the Film Forum, is animated by a similarly feisty spirit. It's about a young girl's struggle for independence against the forces -- her parents, her town, the way things are -- that rein her in.</p>

        <p>Mooney Pottie (her given name is Agnes Marie) is a dreamy, bookish teenager living in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, in the mid-1970's and longing to be anywhere else. Life in her close-knit, conservative small town seems unbearably drab; even the riot of ill-matched plaids that seems to be New Waterford's idea of fashion can't overcome its essential grayness. This is the kind of place where thrift and common sense dictate that a shotgun wedding at the local church double as a funeral, in spite of the inconvenience of sorting out condolence cards from congratulations. No wonder Mooney dreams of Rome, Paris and above all, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago Allan Moyle, who directed this quirky, charming movie from Tricia Fish's eagle-eyed script, made ''Pump Up the Volume,'' a cheerfully incendiary fable of teenage rebellion starring Christian Slater as an insurgent boy disc jockey. While the look and setting of his new picture are different, ''New Waterford Girl,'' which opens today at the Film Forum, is animated by a similarly feisty spirit. It's about a young girl's struggle for independence against the forces -- her parents, her town, the way things are -- that rein her in.</p>
        <p>It's not exactly a new story, but the filmmakers' sense of local color, their springy, disjointed narrative style and a general refusal on their part or the actors' to stoop to caricature give this version a freshness and intensity that recall the television series ''My So-Called Life'' of blessed memory. Liane Balaban, an 18-year-old from Toronto making her first film appearance in the role of Mooney, is like an angrier, more angular Winona Rider. She captures both Mooney's worldliness and her naivete as she tries out poses and attitudes on her uncomprehending family.</p>
        <p>These include her two older sisters, who are full of confused and confusing information about sex, sin and social acceptability, a harried mother (Mary Walsh) and a good-humored dad (Nicholas Campbell), who has an impossible dream of his own: to watch his hockey game in peace and quiet. It would have been easy to make the elder Potties into small-minded clowns or repressed ogres, but Ms. Fish, helped by these two fine actors, allows us to catch glimpses of the world of work, family and local pride they inhabit.</p>
        <p>Mooney's allies are Cecil Sweeney, a gloomy schoolteacher (Andrew McCarthy, majestically coiffed in full pompadour and three-inch sideburns), and Lou Benzoa, a pugnacious neighbor (Tara Spencer-Nairn). Both are outsiders, thrown up on the shores of Cape Breton for reasons the script doesn't entirely explain.</p>
        <p>Lou is the daughter of a disgraced New York boxer (her mother is played by Cathy Moriarty, in quiet tribute to her role as Mrs. Jake LaMotta in ''Raging Bull'' 20 years ago), and she uses her inherited pugilistic skill to take revenge on the two-timing, sweet-talking men of New Waterford. She and Mooney, cruising through town in a beat-up car, are like a maritime Thelma and Louise, all fired up with nowhere to go.</p>
        <p>Except that Mooney has noticed that a select group of local girls -- the unwed, pregnant ones -- manage to escape as far as Antigonish, where their babies are given up for adoption. So Mooney conceives, as it were, an elaborate plan to trash her reputation; to transform herself from the town nerd to the town slut. In its second half, ''New Waterford Girl,'' which had been a meandering tour of its locale, accelerates into a comedy of sexual misunderstanding -- not the least of which is Mooney's own incomprehension of sexual matters.</p>
        <p>The soundtrack, meanwhile, outdoes ''The Virgin Suicides'' in its devotion to the great bad music of the 1970's. Perhaps out of a desire for absolute authenticity, perhaps in order to meet Canadian-content requirements, there is a heavy emphasis on bands like April Wine and a Foot in Cold Water. There is also a welcome if anachronistic performance by the present-day Cape Breton fiddle sensation Ashley MacIsaac and an a cappella rendition of an old sea chantey -- sly reminders that out-of-the-way places are not necessarily cultural backwaters.</p>
        <p>''New Waterford Girl'' is being shown with ''When the Day Breaks,'' an animated short film by Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis that sketches a landscape of urban disconnection populated by farm animals. The story, a curious mixture of somberness and whimsy, involves the chance encounter between a shy pig dressed in kerchief, cloth coat and sensible shoes, and a brusque, business-suited chicken.</p>
