        <p>The immensely talented Alec Baldwin plays Mr. Conductor in ''Thomas and the Magic Railroad,'' which moves the PBS children's show ''Shining Time Station'' to the big screen.

        <p>The immensely talented Alec Baldwin plays Mr. Conductor in ''Thomas and the Magic Railroad,'' which moves the PBS children's show ''Shining Time Station'' to the big screen. He offers not only the most seductively menacing voice ever heard from a good guy in a G-rated movie, but also a vigor not normally seen in such a picture. The amiable torpor of the film is left in a shambles after each of his scenes.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Conductor is only 18 inches tall, Baldwin's brio makes him as big as the smiling trains in the fantasy railroad yard.</p>
        <p>In the early television episodes of ''Shining Time Station,'' where the I-Know-I-Can adventures of Thomas the Tank Engine, the talking train, unfold, Mr. Conductor was played by Ringo Starr (who was replaced by George Carlin). Mr. Starr was so lovably oblivious to everything, including shouts of sell-out by his former band's biggest fans, that he was an ideal choice for a paperweight-size imp. His woozy calm conferred an air of believability on the show, and his approach was the opposite of Mr. Baldwin's.</p>
        <p>The feature film does share several things with the television show, chief among them the concept that it's staged for either very young or very sleepy children. It's very slow, though it does offer a respite from the overactive animation that kids are mostly subjected to.</p>
        <p>Thomas and his steam engine friends, who were introduced in ''The Railway'' series of books by the Rev. Wilber Vere Awdry, have to race against a mean diesel engine and his dumb cronies to prevent them from destroying the magical land in which they live.</p>
        <p>There's something about a vanishing supply of magic dust, which probably accounts for the glumness of Peter Fonda, who plays a grandfather longing for his happy childhood. (Mr. Fonda, whose character is too depressed to be intimidated by Mr. Baldwin's ferocity, seems to be starring in ''Ulee's Train.'') Mara Wilson, the young actress who played one of the children in ''Mrs. Doubtfire'' and starred in ''Matilda,'' portrays his granddaughter. Michael E. Rodgers, as Mr. C Junior, Mr. Conductor's Scottish surfer-dude cousin, neither overacts nor sleepwalks through the picture.</p>
        <p>I suppose you could make a case for ''Thomas and the Magic Railroad,'' that it is functioning as a metaphor for maintaining the innocence of childhood, which is just the thing parents will have the time to do during this extremely poky movie. It's like watching one of those live-action children's shows of the 70's, in which not much happens but it all takes place slowly and emphatically (imagine a feature film version of  ''Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' without the same assumption of its young audience's intelligence).</p>
        <p>The primitive brightness of the sets and Mr. Baldwin's intensity, which is just as garish, is vaguely reminiscent of those harshly colored, badly overdubbed ''Pippi Longstocking'' movies that left many young audience members shivering through nightmares. Mr. Baldwin's attack -- there's no better way to put it -- is unforgettable. He's the first shrunken narrator with a serial killer's swagger.</p>
