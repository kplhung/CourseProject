        <p>Usually the only gloves in a home cook's kitchen are under the sink, for washing dishes. But anyone who has shaky knife skills might also consider a protective glove, like one of the lightweight knit ones made of synthetic fibers reinforced with stainless steel from Chefwear in Chicago (800-568-2433). There's a thin silver one for $17 (below, right) and a heavier ivory one (center) for $19. They might even motivate a pro to chop or slice faster, but take care; they're not 100 percent puncture- or slice-proof. These gloves can also be used when opening clams or oysters, though for that job you might splurge on a glove of stainless-steel mesh (left) like the chain mail of yesteryear; it's $134 from Savoir Vivre in Philadelphia (215-625-7964). And remember: the glove goes on the hand not wielding Excalibur.</p>
