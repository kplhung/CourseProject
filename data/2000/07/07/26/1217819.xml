        <p>And on the 15th day, the Israelis and the Palestinians packed their bags and left their pastoral retreat at Camp David empty-handed, exhausted and still in conflict. In immediate retrospect, the hope that they could have resolved a 52-year-old, blood-soaked dispute in a fortnight seems like the summit of idealism.</p>
        <p>With the potential for violence looming, what happens now to this prizefight of all ethnic, religious and territorial conflicts? The Palestinians entered swinging and the Israelis left swinging, and while the American referees bounced quickly back to their feet, it is unclear when and if the two sides will re-enter the ring. In the end, did the meeting help or hurt the peace effort?</p>
        <p>As President Clinton described it on his return to the White House today, he believed that he was compelled to force the issue by convening the talks. After seven years of stop-and-start peace negotiations, with the threat of an impending return to violent conflict, there was no longer any point in avoiding an official grappling with the thorniest points. It was time for a moment of reckoning, for the leaders to stare at themselves in the mirror and also face ''the abyss,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But before the Camp David meeting, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, repeatedly said that the moment had not arrived, that the talks were premature, that the groundwork had not been laid. Perhaps he should have been heeded. As Prime Minister Ehud Barak repeated today, it does take two to tango.</p>
        <p>Israeli and American officials knew that in general, Mr. Arafat makes no decision before its time, and Mr. Arafat's personal working deadline is Sept. 13.</p>
        <p>That is when the most recent interim peace agreement expires, and when the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership has pledged to declare a state unilaterally if a permanent peace has not been reached -- an act that could provoke a chain of unilateral actions and violent events.</p>
        <p>Putting the best possible face on the meeting's failure to produce an agreement, Mr. Clinton asserted that the Israelis and Palestinians had broken seven years of official silence to conduct ''unprecedented'' discussions of emotional issues like Jerusalem. He said the parties had made significant progress on every core dispute, and American officials said they expected the peace effort to continue after a period of ''reflection.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Barak made clear that he believed that the present ''chapter'' of peacemaking had reached an end. Addressing reporters at the Hampton Inn in Frederick, Md., Mr. Barak spoke as if had already moved on.</p>
        <p>''If we have to go to a confrontation,'' he said, ''we will be able to look straight into the eyes of our children and say we did everything, everything in order to prevent a confrontation.''</p>
        <p>Having reportedly offered concessions on every issue, Mr. Barak, who has staked his political career on the single goal of peacemaking, apparently does not see a clear path ahead. He called the summit meeting a ''significant milestone, and at this point, the last one, in intensive and deep negotiations.''</p>
        <p>All understandings reached at Camp David, he said conclusively, are moot, vanished into the mist that clouded the talks during two weeks of intermittent rain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak's somber assessment did not square at all with the uncharacteristically upbeat one offered by a senior Palestinian negotiator this afternoon. Speaking in Pentagon City, Saeb Erekat said emphatically that Camp David had paved the way for a peace agreement by Sept. 13.</p>
        <p>''The prospect of an agreement is much stronger than ever before,'' Mr. Erekat said. ''What happened at Camp David are seeds that will grow very fast.''</p>
        <p>It was a perplexing optimism, although it may have expressed a certain amount of anxiety that the Palestinians had squandered some reserves of American good will toward their cause. But after two weeks in intensive, round-the-clock negotiations during which an American president pushed aside nearly all other business, the Israeli and the Palestinian leaders explored every issue and, particularly in regard to determining the sovereignty of Jerusalem, hit a wall.</p>
        <p>Why would lower-level negotiations be able to progress further or, if the leaders reassembled, why would the picture change?</p>
        <p>After all, Mr. Erekat continued to insist today that all would be well and good provided that Mr. Barak does what he has said he cannot do: acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of both Israel and the future Palestine.</p>
        <p>Is Jerusalem an inexorably intractable issue, or is there some give on either side that somehow was not discovered in the seclusion of the Catoctin Mountains but will emerge later?</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat will return home to a hero's welcome, not just in the West Bank and Gaza Strip but in the Arab world, whose capitals he will tour immediately.</p>
        <p>His popularity at home, lower than ever before he departed, will be boosted by the perception that he faced down Israel and a superpower without conceding any of what Palestinians consider their sacred principles, especially their sovereignty over East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>''I believe that everyone will go out to applaud Arafat and say to him, 'Welcome home, Mr. President,' '' said Hani al-Hassan, a member of the central committee of Mr. Arafat's Fatah movement.</p>
        <p>It is more complex for Mr. Barak. Right before he left, he lost three right-leaning parties from his broad coalition. Leaving without a government and returning without an agreement, he faces a good deal of uncertainty, and any uncertainty about his political future clouds the prospects for peace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak has political options that would involve alliances incompatible with any immediate progress at the peace tables. What he cannot do is continue at the head of a minority government, representing only 42 of the 120 members of Parliament. It is not sustainable; he would not be able to accomplish anything.</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Barak will bring home a one-page, trilateral statement reaffirming the value of making peace. That is a long way from an accord.</p>
        <p>Certainly, Camp David represents a significant juncture in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But where it will lead, beyond a thicket of diplomatic and political complications, is impossible to predict.</p>
