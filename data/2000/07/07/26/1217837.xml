        <p>Institutional investors avoided the Midtown South sector of Manhattan for a long time, concentrating on the larger and more glamorous properties in Midtown and downtown. Now, with rents soaring in the area from 34th Street to Canal Street, pension funds and opportunity investors are beginning to plunge in.</p>
        <p>Starwood Urban, an affiliate of the the big real estate investor Starwood Capital, has bought the building at 430 West 14th Street, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund pension fund invested $115 million last fall in the old Port Authority inland terminal at 111 Eighth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets.</p>
        <p>Recently, Koll Bren Schreiber, a pension fund adviser based in Boston, persuaded one such fund to buy two buildings from the late Harry Helmsley's dwindling portfolio, 245 and 261 Fifth Avenue, at 28th and 29th Streets, respectively. The company plans to upgrade the buildings to attract new-economy and service-industry tenants, who have flocked to the Flatiron Building at 23rd Street.</p>
        <p>''We are a value-added investor,'' said Charles A. Valentino, a senior vice president of Koll Bren Schreiber. ''We invest capital to improve the quality of a building we think is in an emerging market.''</p>
        <p>He said the elevators, heating, air-conditioning and lobbies of both late 1920's buildings would be renovated, with new windows going into 245 Fifth. Both buildings will be wired for the high-speed Internet access that virtually all tenants demand today, and bathrooms and common corridors will also be improved.</p>
        <p>The two buildings are the first investments in Midtown South for the company, whose sole previous investment in the city was the building at 50 Broadway in the financial district. Mr. Valentino said the company, which controls 74 million square feet of real estate nationally, valued at $4.5 billion, was shopping for additional properties.</p>
        <p>''We think New York City will outperform many other markets,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Rental rates in the area have been shooting up in recent months, according to figures compiled by Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the brokerage and real estate services company. After surpassing $30 a square foot in the first quarter of this year, the average annual rental jumped to $39.65 a foot by the end of June, and in some submarkets actually went over $40.</p>
        <p>The effort to reposition the buildings from their current status on the fringe of the garment district to one more oriented toward the booming Flatiron area will be helped by the shortage of space in Midtown South, said Mitchell L. Konsker, an executive director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
        <p>With the vacancy rate in the district at 3.7 percent at the end of June, he said, companies are trying to protect their ability to grow by taking space in buildings where future expiration of leases held by other companies will give them room to expand. Midtown South is generally defined as the area between 34th and Canal Streets, river to river.</p>
        <p>''With the tightness of the market, tenants are looking for buildings where there is space for expansion in a few years but where they do not currently have to pay rent,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Matthew R. Astrachan, a senior director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, said the expiration dates for leases in effect meant that 250,000 to 300,000 square feet of space would be coming available over the next 24 months, much of it in easily marketable 20,000-to-30,000-square-foot blocks. He said those spaces would be marketed to publishing, advertising and other service industry tenants being squeezed out of streets closer to the Flatiron Building, streets on which rents are approaching $50 a square foot. He said there were now about 100 tenants in the two buildings, with some of them in small spaces.</p>
        <p>The plan, Mr. Konsker said, is to reduce the total number of tenants, so that space can be assembled in the more attractive larger blocks.</p>
        <p>There is retail space of about 14,000 square feet on the first floor of 245 Fifth Avenue that was formerly occupied by a branch of Chase Bank, which bought out its lease's remaining years. The site, Mr. Astrachan said, is going to be marketed to a ''high end'' restaurant, which will presumably be attracted by the well-paid professionals coming to the area.</p>
        <p>Retail space is available at 261 Fifth Avenue as well, but a restaurant is not likely there because the Marble Collegiate Church is across the avenue and New York City law bans establishments selling alcohol from operating within 200 feet of a house of worship.</p>
        <p>There are still garment industry tenants at 261 Fifth, who are so uninterested in the view of the Empire State and Flatiron Buildings available from upper floors that they block out windows in their showrooms so that buyers can see the goods as they will be displayed in stores. Those tenants will be consolidated on a few floors, rather than stay spread around the building, Mr. Konsker said, so that new tenants can enjoy the views and natural light.</p>
