        <p>Richard J. Callahan started his career stringing telephone lines in South Dakota in the 1960's. Now he is stringing together cable television systems in Europe, and he may soon be one of its biggest operators.</p>
        <p>To the astonishment if not anger of many rivals, Mr. Callahan recently outmaneuvered a number of European companies in acquiring Germany's biggest cable television system from Deutsche Telekom. He is well on his way to acquiring a second system from Telekom, the former government monopoly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Callahan's venture is a local sideshow to Deutsche Telekom's far more prominent effort to buy VoiceStream, a cellular telephone company in the United States. But it offers an important glimpse into what some see as Deutsche Telekom's efforts to insulate itself from competition at home, even as it seeks to expand abroad.</p>
        <p>If all goes according to plan, Mr. Callahan and his partners will serve about one-third of Germany's 17 million cable customers by the end of this year. And like a number of other cable operators, Mr. Callahan has big plans for upgrading his systems to offer telephone service, high-speed access to the Internet and interactive television.</p>
        <p>But looming over all these plans is the giant shadow of Deutsche Telekom itself. The upgraded systems would compete directly with Deutsche Telekom, which has insisted on keeping a 45 percent stake in each cable system. Indeed, other aspiring bidders complain the German company went out of its way to make sure the cable systems would be too fragmented to pose a serious threat.</p>
        <p>Some go further, arguing that Deutsche Telekom intentionally picked buyers who would be the least likely to cause it competitive heartburn. When Deutsche Telekom announced plans to sell its cable systems two years ago, more than 35 companies expressed interest. Today, all but a handful of those companies have either dropped out or have been deemed unqualified by Deutsche Telekom executives.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the only people who have actually bought a system so far are Mr. Callahan and a secretive American financier named Gary A. Klesch. Even more striking, executives on all sides say that Deutsche Telekom selected Mr. Callahan's bid even though it was lower than one from the investment arm of Deutsche Bank.</p>
        <p>''It's pretty clear that Deutsche Telekom wanted to keep as much control of these systems as it could,'' said Paul Thomassen, chief financial officer of Primacom, Germany's fourth-largest cable operator, whose bids were also rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. Callahan declined to be interviewed, saying that the company had just completed a bond offering and was prohibited by American securities laws from making public statements.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Callahan has been quite public about his plans. As head of international ventures in the early 1990's for U S West, the regional Bell telephone company, he helped launch Telewest, the British cable company that was one of the world's first to offer telephone and cable television over the same system.</p>
        <p>Now, backed by investors like the Blackstone Group and GE Capital, Callahan Associates International is already building advanced cable systems in Spain and France and has raised nearly $8 billion to pay for its German venture.</p>
        <p>Under orders from antitrust regulators at the European Commission, who wanted to see cable systems competing with telephone carriers, Deutsche Telekom agreed to spin off its cable properties two years ago.</p>
        <p>Earlier this summer, Mr. Callahan's group paid about $3.5 billion for a controlling stake in Deutsche Telekom's cable network in North-Rhine Westphalia. Now he is in exclusive negotiations to buy a second German system for nearly $2 billion, which would give him control of about one-third of the German cable television market.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, however, Deutsche Telekom executives have made it clear they are worried about somebody transforming the cable systems into a nationwide rival of the phone company.</p>
        <p>To block potential buyers from establishing a nationwide network, the German telephone giant divided its national network into nine regions. It also insisted on retaining a 45 percent stake in each of the systems,  which is enough under German law to veto mergers and perhaps capital increases as well.</p>
        <p>The most startling aspect of the process is the way buyers have been selected. Executives on all sides of the auction say that Mr. Callahan's bid for the North Rhine system was significantly lower than an offer from Deutsche Bank's investment arm, DB Investor.</p>
        <p>Yet Deutsche Telekom executives flatly rejected DB Investor's bid.  ''They basically told us they didn't want us to have those systems, because it would make us too big,'' said one person close to DB Investor, which had outlined plans to stitch together a nationwide network.</p>
        <p>Ulrich Lissek, a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom, insisted that his company had no intention of blocking competition or influencing the cable systems. But he acknowledged that the company had not necessarily picked buyers who offered the highest price.</p>
        <p>''For us, it is not interesting just to get the best price,'' Mr. Lissek said.  ''The best price says nothing about the future of the company, nothing about the targets of the owner and nothing about the future of the employees.''</p>
        <p>Those arguments are believable when applied to Mr. Callahan. But they strain credibility when applied to the other big winner in the cable auctions, Mr. Klesch.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Callahan, Mr. Klesch has no experience in running cable television systems or any other kind of communications business. As founder of Klesch &amp; Company in London, he spent much of the last decade investing in the securities of financially troubled European ventures like the Channel Tunnel.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Klesch's lack of experience, Telekom executives selected him to buy a system that serves more than one million subscribers in Hesse, the prosperous state that includes Frankfurt. As soon as that deal closed, the company picked Mr. Klesch to enter exclusive negotiations for two other sytems in Lower Saxony and in eastern Germany.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klesch remains a mystery to most people in the industry and refused to return numerous calls requesting an interview. He appears to operate out of a small office in London with a handful of employees. He has been secretive about his sources of financing, but a prospectus for a new junk-bond offering earlier this month disclosed that he recently sold a 35 percent stake in his German venture to NTL Communications, which owns cable systems in Britain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Callahan, by contrast, has been comparatively open. His company has raised nearly $5 billion for its German efforts, including $1 billion from the Blackstone Group and other investors; more than $3 billion in senior debt and about $750 million in high-yield junk bonds.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Klesch, Mr. Callahan has also recruited a high-powered team of executives. Last month, he persuaded Andrew Sukawaty, the chief executive of the Sprint Corporation's nationwide wireless telephone network, to become president of Callahan Associates. William Barker, who had previously headed a unit of GE Capital devoted to investments in telecommunications, is one of Mr. Callahan's lead scouts for deals. Many other executives are veterans from U S West International and were involved in introducing Telewest and the One-2-One mobile telephone network in Britain.</p>
        <p>None of that erases the question of whether Deutsche Telekom will allow Mr. Callahan to operate freely in Germany. One of Telekom's hottest businesses is providing Internet access, and it is aggressively marketing high-speed lines known as digital subscriber loops.</p>
        <p>Mr. Callahan, along with many other cable operators, plans to compete head-to-head in those fields by upgrading the traditional systems with fiber optics and two-way communications.</p>
        <p>Telekom executives made it clear more than a year ago that they were worried about overly aggressive competitors. People close to Telekom say one reason they were hostile to Deutsche Bank was that they suspected it was acting as a front for Mannesmann, its archrival in both wireless and hard-wired telephone services. Mannesmann had wanted to bid on several cable properties, but was turned down flat.</p>
        <p>Telekom executives had originally proposed selling only minority stakes in its cable systems, but that idea was rejected by antitrust regulators. But in retaining 45 percent of each system, the telephone company can block mergers and other major corporate changes.</p>
        <p>Mergers are almost certain to be of critical importance, because Callahan needs more scale in Germany and it also needs to acquire a number of companies that actually own the wires into customers' homes.</p>
        <p>Callahan executives say they negotiated legal agreements under which Telekom agreed not to invoke its veto rights on questions about capital increases. According to its bond prospectus, Telekom also agreed not to veto most acquisitions within the cable system's own region.</p>
        <p>But Deutsche Telekom did not agree to accept mergers with neighboring cable operators automatically. That is potentially important, because Callahan officials are already looking for other networks to buy and link with their existing properties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lissek, Telekom's spokesman, said his company simply wanted to protect itself. ''If we go under 25 percent, the majority shareholders can make a capital increase or a merger without our agreement, and suddenly we are completely minority shareholders,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As if those restrictions were not enough, many industry executives note that Deutsche Telekom will retain control over 10 channels -- expandable to 80 channels, if signals are transmitted with digital technology -- that will be used to fulfill long-term contracts between Deutsche Telekom and the Munich-based Kirch Group.</p>
        <p>Telekom and Kirch have formed their own joint venture, called MSG, which will transmit programming and has developed its own system of encryption and billing. Though obscure, the demands to accommodate Kirch and MSG worry outside programmers as well as cable operators like Mr. Thomassen of Primacom.</p>
        <p>Callahan executives say they are not worried, but admit that they will have to build additional capacity into the systems before they can embark on their plans for offering full broadband services to customers. That means heavy upfront expense with little initial increase in revenue. Nobody is predicting profits for the next several years.</p>
        <p>''This,'' said one Callahan executive, ''is a long-term position.''</p>
