        <p>Re ''Central Park Shut to Spray for Virus'' (front page, July 25):</p>
        <p>Having recently migrated from New York (where I lived for 17 years) to Florida, I have noted with interest the mosquito problem back home. Mosquitoes used to be a problem down here, though they were more pesky than lethal. Local authorities have all but eliminated the pest by releasing an enormous amount of dragonflies, which devour the pests at an alarming rate.</p>

        <p>Although I'm no expert on the environmental consequences, it seems to be a reasonably efficient, natural, chemical-free solution to a serious problem. I know that the results locally have been at once profound and effective.</p>
