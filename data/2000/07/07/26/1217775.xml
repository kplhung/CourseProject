        <p>They called it Horse Haven when racing was inaugurated at Saratoga Springs in 1863 for a meet that lasted three days. But the next year, the ''new'' Saratoga Race Course opened on Union Avenue. And on Wednesday, for the 132nd year, it will open for racing again, starting a prestigious six-week schedule that will feature 35 stakes races carrying purses of $8.7 million along with historic reminders that the stately old track has also grown to become ''the Graveyard of Champions.''</p>
        <p>On the same oval where Man o' War lost his only race, in the Sanford Stakes 81 years ago, seven 2-year-old fillies will take the spotlight on opening day in the Schuylerville, followed one day later by juvenile colts in the Sanford. They will be the first brace of races for 2-year-olds at Saratoga, where horses begin careers and strengthen their claims to championships.</p>
        <p>The opening-day crowd will be greeted by $3.5 million in renovations that were performed without altering the country style of the old track. They include new jockeys quarters inside a quaint colonial building dating to 1890, new entrances to the clubhouse and grandstand, irrigation systems for the Oklahoma turf training course, dormitory upgrades on the backside and the replacement of 1,275 seats in a remodeled grandstand.</p>
        <p>But one change will be made on the track. D. Wayne Lukas, who has won 5 Schuylervilles, 5 Sanfords and 27 stakes for juveniles over all at Saratoga, will not have a filly in the opening-day feature. But he will be represented through his extended family, so to speak. Mark Hennig, one of several former assistants to Lukas, will enter an all-star pair, Gold Mover, with Craig Perret riding, and With Ability, with Jerry Bailey riding, and they will go to the gate as solid favorites.</p>
        <p>Hennig also trains a third star juvenile filly, Raging Fever, who will wait for her chance on stage later in the meet. All three fillies are owned by Edward P. Evans, the owner of the 2,500-acre Spring Hill Farm in Virginia, who also bred them. So, Hennig and Evans can take a clear shot at all three major races for young fillies at Saratoga: the Schuylerville at six furlongs, the Adirondack at six and a half furlongs on Aug. 14 and the Spinaway at seven furlongs on Sept. 1.</p>
        <p>''It's nice to have a chance to win the first stakes of the meet, and it's nice to be in a position for the sweep,'' Hennig said. ''But Saratoga is a funny place. Strange things can happen here.''</p>
        <p>He didn't have to stretch his memory very far back for proof. Two years ago, the long shot Call Me Up went to the gate at 17-1, led wire to wire and cruised home the winner in the Schuylerville.</p>
        <p>The five other fillies facing Hennig's pair in the Schuylerville also have great expectations starting with Caught Out, who has raced twice and won twice at Woodbine in Canada.</p>
        <p>''She's a filly that wants to run on,'' said Roger Attfield, who trains Caught Out for Richard Bonnycastle. ''She's got enough class to win sprinting, but she's not a sprinter. She's definitely training well enough, and she's ready for this race.''</p>
        <p>When the juvenile colts appear on Thursday to complete Round 1 of the 2-year-old series, Lukas will be back on track with Michael Tabor's Yonaguska. The colt, a son of Cherokee Run, the 1994 sprint champion, was bought in February for $1.9 million. He won his debut at Churchill Downs by nine lengths and won his next start at Belmont in the Flash Stakes, dashing five and a half furlongs in 574/5  seconds.</p>
        <p>''We know he's fast,'' Lukas allowed. ''Now the trick is getting him to relax. We've had 14 different 2-year-old winners this year, and it's been our most successful summer with them yet. We're very deep on these colts, and it's too early to tell who's the best.''</p>
