        <p>Smiling alongside Dick Cheney in Texas today as he became Gov. George W. Bush's running mate was Mr. Cheney's high school sweetheart and wife of 36 years.</p>
        <p>But Lynne V. Cheney, 58, is no ordinary political wife. She is an unusually high-profile figure with a national reputation as a passionate opponent of ''political correctness'' and with a public record that is even more conservative than her husband's.</p>
        <p>As chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities during the Reagan and Bush administrations and later as a television, newspaper and magazine commentator, Mrs. Cheney has been a cultural warrior and darling of the right, accusing those she calls cultural relativists of taking over American art, literature and education.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mrs. Cheney is one of her party's most forceful figures, and some Republicans think she deserves a cabinet post in a new administration and even belonged on Mr. Bush's list of vice-presidential prospects.</p>
        <p>''She is fantastic,'' the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, gushed today. ''In fact, she was my wife's first choice. She has a very strong conservative philosophy. She's just very attractive as a candidate in her own right, which she's never been. But she certainly will be a great helpmate to Dick Cheney.''</p>
        <p>Friends of Mrs. Cheney say she has made no secret about political ambitions of her own. Indeed, in introducing Mr. Cheney as his running mate today, Mr. Bush also singled her out, describing her as ''a leader in education reform in all America, developing high standards and a sound curriculum for our public schools.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cheney holds a doctorate in 19th-century British literature from the University of Wisconsin. (Her dissertation was about the effect of Immanuel Kant's ideas on the poetry of Matthew Arnold.) She and her husband wrote a history of eight speakers of the House, and she later wrote ''Telling the Truth,'' a book in which she maintains that objective truth has become less important in the climate of modern America than the spinning of politically motivated stories.</p>
        <p>She has also written novels, one about pioneer women in the American West, another a political thriller about Washington whose characters include a vice president who dies of what she delicately calls ''carnal arrest'' while in the company of a television newswoman.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cheney, the mother of two grown daughters, attributes her sense of moral rectitude to her own upbringing in Casper, Wyo., where her mother was a deputy sheriff and her father an engineer. ''You cannot be a good person in public and a bad person in private,'' she once told an interviewer. ''They would know in a small town.''</p>
        <p>At Natrona County High School in Casper, Lynne Vincent was chief of the baton squad and homecoming queen. Dick Cheney was the captain of the football team and senior class president, and, she once said, had a terrific crew cut. She went on from there to Colorado College, where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
        <p>In 1978, she was teaching English at the University of Wyoming when her husband, running for Wyoming's lone seat in the House, suffered a heart attack. She filled in on the stump for six weeks. He won the race, and went on to serve 10 years in Congress.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Cheney worked as a congressman and then as defense secretary, Mrs. Cheney used her position as head of the national endowment to assert an increasingly conservative ideology. She was accused by many scholars of politicizing the endowment's grant-making by favoring traditional over multicultural projects and loading the endowment's peer review committees with conservatives.</p>
        <p>After the Bush administration, she became a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, where she promoted her vision of a more wholesome, morally correct, educationally rigorous America. She also sometimes sat in the conservative chair on the CNN television program ''Crossfire,'' where she denounced what she described as declining cultural standards, especially in the schools.</p>
