        <p>A group of dancers recently asked the longtime stage manager Maxine Glorsky for a list of choreographers whose work she would like to see performed at ''Party for Max,'' a celebration of her 60th birthday at the Joyce Theater in September. Most readily agreed to have their work performed on the program. But dance by two major choreographers she named will not be seen.</p>
        <p>''It would have been impossible to pursue'' a piece by Martha Graham, said Richard Daniels, one of the tribute planners, in view of bitter ongoing battles between the Graham board and dancers and Ron Protas, head of the Martha Graham Trust, which licences her dances.</p>
        <p>And the fee to restage a piece by the West Coast choreographer Lester Horton, which included travel from California for a restager designated by Lester Horton Dance Theater, was more than the cost of the tribute itself. Luckily, Ms. Glorsky did not ask for a piece by Erick Hawkins, who died intestate in 1994. The ownership of his work is still in question.</p>
        <p>''If a dance isn't danced, does it really exist?'' Mr. Daniels asked. His question is rhetorical but valid.</p>
        <p>There was a time when the chief impediment to reviving dances was that the work was out of fashion. Now, death and the notion of ownership have seemingly created even more insurmountable problems.</p>
        <p>Growing sophistication about preserving the legacy of dance has to a large extent institutionalized the handing-down of choreography, which was first passed down from dancer to dancer, then by written notation and film and video. The idea of owning a dance as property is relatively new. Changes in copyright law that went into effect in 1978 are partly responsible for that notion; so is an increasing general interest in copyright and ownership as newmedia widen the possibilities for illegally appropriating the artistic property of others.</p>
        <p>An era died with Graham. The ownership of her dances is emotionally fraught. In recent months the Graham board has effectively closed down the operations of its senior and junior companies and school and removed Mr. Protas, who inherited Graham's dances and the right to her name on her death in 1991, from the board. Engagements in the United States and abroad have been canceled. Mr. Protas has denied the company and its dancers the right to perform the choreography. And the dancers have appealed to institutions and individuals worldwide to boycott the works. The trust is expected to take legal action soon.</p>
        <p>Horton, an innovative modern-dance choreographer with a distinctive movement style, died in 1953. Frank Eng, to whom Horton left his works, created the Horton foundation last year and appointed Don Martin, a former Horton dancer, to stage the pieces. ''My only interest at this point is to reconstruct and hand down the most accurate material possible,'' Mr. Eng said.</p>
        <p>The foundation is raising money to train a group of Horton restagers who will be able to assist Mr. Martin. But first- and second-generation Horton performers and teachers scattered across the United States complain that they know at least as much about the dances as Mr. Martin does and are eager to recreate Horton's seldom-seen works and teach his technique before they vanish.</p>
        <p>Choreographers of Horton's era often did not bother to arrange for their work to live on after their death. Charles Weidman, who formed a pioneering modern-dance company with Doris Humphrey in 1928, did not leave a will when he died in 1973. Eventually the New York State Surrogate Court's public administrator gave his dance material to a newly formed foundation that is responsible for their restaging today.</p>
        <p>Most living choreographers own their own dances and license them through their companies or foundations. Though choreographers have been fond of proclaiming that they do not want their work to live on after them, some do make provisions. George Balanchine left his dances to colleagues, who restage them for ballet companies throughout the world under the aegis of the Balanchine Trust, formed in 1987 and considered a model in the field.</p>
        <p>Humphrey left her dances to her son, Charles Woodford, who arranged for their licensing through the Dance Notation Bureau, a center in Manhattan for the preservation of choreography and dance techniques through written notation. The bureau also handles the smaller ballets of Antony Tudor and works with the Weidman Foundation. Jose Limon, a leading modern-dance choreographer who died in 1972, did not mention his works in his will. They were divided among his heirs and sold back to the Jose Limon Dance Foundation, which is now responsible for their licensing.</p>
        <p>But no will has been found for Hawkins's widow, the composer Lucia Dlugoszewski, who died suddenly in April. The public administrator must now provide for the disposal not only of the dances, sets and costumes but also of Dlugoszewski's scores, many of which were an integral part of Hawkins' choreography and aesthetic. The process can be long, depending partly on whether heirs exist with solid claims to the estate. Katherine Duke, who now heads the Hawkins company, says that the dancers are ready to perform. She has also had requests to restage Hawkins's work. ''At the moment, everything is still in the hands of the state,'' she said. ''And they're not making any promises.''</p>
        <p>Even going by the rules can be difficult. Dances go into the public domain 70 years after the choreographer's death. Work created before 1909 is automatically considered to be in the public domain. Later amendments or additions of new material are copyrighted by the choreographer who creates the additions, and this has raised legal questions of ownership. Similarly, who owns a dance made by a staff choreographer for a specific company?</p>
        <p>Choreographers have always taken material from one another, and even the new copyright law cannot prevent that entirely. What the law did do was to make it easier to copyright a dance, to turn it into property. Before the changes, dances could be registered for copyright only through imprecise written descriptions, the most reliable of which were notated dance ''scores.'' ''It was like trying to get copyright protection by publishing the libretto,'' said Theodore Striggles, an arts and intellectual property lawyer and former dancer.</p>
        <p>Now, a simple rehearsal film or videotape is enough to ''fix'' or establish the entity of a work. ''In theory, the moment the film was made there was sufficient fixation,'' Mr. Striggles said, ''which left everything protected that was ever filmed except for improvisation.'' Those in dance know that they may risk legal problems if they fold even a few taped moments of Paul Taylor's version of ''Le Sacre du Printemps'' into a documentary without getting permission from Mr. Taylor and the estate of the composer Igor Stravinsky, even if the documentary is being made by a deserving nonprofit arts institution.</p>
        <p>It is even possible to trademark a choreographer's name, as has been done by the Martha Graham Trust and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater Foundation. The Ailey board bought the rights to Ailey's dances from his mother, to whom the choreographer had left them, and the rights to his name from his step-brother. ''The board felt the dances had to be owned by a nonprofit institution and not a single person who could sell 'Revelations' to the Rockettes,'' said Sharon Luckman, executive director of the Ailey company. But ''Revelations'' and another early classic, ''Blues Suite,'' are never licensed to other companies, she said.</p>
        <p>Who should own a dance? It could be argued that any art might be described as the intellectual property of a nation after its creator's death, particularly if it was made with public funds. It could also be argued that the old-time dancers who have gathered over the decades to reconstruct lost works by long-dead choreographers, relying on their own muscle memory, should be entitled to some portion of ownership.</p>
        <p>Thorny aesthetic questions must often also be addressed. Ms. Duke, the Hawkins dancer, wonders whether companies willing to undertake the cost of performing the works to live music should get a reduction in the licensing fee. ''Erick and Lucy lived for live music,'' she said. ''Some in the company feel the dances will never be seen if we demand that they be done to live music.''</p>
        <p>Choreographers tend to tinker with and rework dances long after their premieres. Which version of a dance should be considered the authentic property? Sally Bliss, the head of the Tudor Trust in St. Louis, Mo., was faced with a difficult question when the Jose Limon Dance Company asked for Tudor's ''Dark Elegies.''</p>
        <p>The dance had been created for a ballet troupe, with the women performing it on point. Would the flat modern-dance slippers of the Limon company violate the aesthetic of the piece? She decided to license the piece to Limon because she felt ''Dark Elegies'' also needed the kind of physical weight that the modern-dance company would bring to the piece. (Ballet is airborne; modern dance traditionally is earthbound.)</p>
        <p>The Tudor foundation is known as one of the most generous of licensing institutions. Ms. Bliss charges from $6,000 to $10,000, depending in part on the size and prominence of the company, for a three- to six-year contract, with a standard $100 per-performance royalty fee. Videotapes can  only be used for restaging if the restager has danced a role in the ballet.</p>
        <p>''Everyone says I should raise the fees, but people say they can't afford it and I believe them,'' said Ms. Bliss, a former Tudor dancer and friend. ''I think it's wonderful so many people are doing Tudor.'' She gives regional companies a longer contract because  they perform less frequently than big-city troupes. ''The regionals can't do a work again the next year,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In general, fees for the licensing of the dance alone, which does not include music rights, costumes and scenery rentals and some other expenses, range from $1,000 per minute, the Horton foundation's charge, to a scale of $10,000 to $50,000 for one to three-year contracts. A few choreographers go as high as $100,000. Factors in determining the fee can also include the length and complexity of the work, the number of performances and the size of the geographical area in which the dance will be performed.</p>
        <p>Most restagers are longtime performers of the dances who have often been chosen by the choreographers themselves. The Ailey company often sends Masazumi Chaya, its associate artistic director and chief restager, to inspect a company before it acquires its first Ailey dance.</p>
        <p>Once a dance is licensed, it must also be maintained. Changes inevitably creep in, whether through sloppiness or individual interpretation. Many licensing institutions require that the company train an in-house regisseur or ballet master who will continue to monitor the performing level and correctness of the work. The Manhattan-based Nikolais-Louis Foundation for Dance requires that any revival of a work by Alwin Nikolais or Murray Louis two years after its staging must be restaged by the designated reconstructor.</p>
        <p>Dance companies tend to change their full complement of performers and staff every two years, Mr. Louis said. And unlike companies that perform only the work of their founding choreographers, repertory companies dance a variety of styles. ''The internal coloration of a dance can be lost,'' Mr. Louis said. ''Dancers remember what but not how.''</p>
        <p>Money is less an issue, many say believably, than trying to keep the dances alive in as authentic a version as possible. ''The point is to disseminate, not to be billionaires,'' said Jane Hermann, the director of dance at International Creative Management. ''It's a judgment call as to how best to disseminate the work.''</p>
