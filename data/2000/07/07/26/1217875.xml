        <p>A long-awaited Russian component docked with the International Space Station tonight, marking what project planners hope will be a resurgence in construction of the orbital outpost.</p>
        <p>The Russian service module, named Zvezda or ''star,'' and the two components making up the budding station closed on each other and docked at 8:45 p.m. Eastern time while soaring 230 miles above Kazakhstan.</p>
        <p>''Contact is confirmed,'' said Kyle Herring, a NASA commentator at the Russian control center outside Moscow as applause broke out in the background.</p>
        <p>Latches on the space station closed to secure the new module, which is to serve as the command and living headquarters for international crews while the station is being built.</p>
        <p>Zvezda, a 42,000-pound pressurized section the size of a city bus, joined two previously orbited units that together weighed 70,000 pounds to form the core around which the rest of the $60 billion research station could be built.</p>
        <p>Late arrival of the 43-foot-long Zvezda, delayed more than 19 months because of financial problems in cash-strapped Russia and trouble with the Proton booster rocket that eventually sent it into space two weeks ago, has stymied space station construction and strained the international partnership sponsoring the ambitious project.</p>
        <p>After confirming the attachment of Zvezda to the station and testing the airtight seal between components during the next three days, computers in the new module are to assume control over the entire complex as it awaits a space shuttle crew, due in early September, to complete the matchup.</p>
        <p>Today's activities were the culmination of a two-week orbital ballet in which Zvezda slowly worked its way up to the two previously launched space station components. Zvezda had an almost flawless launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan atop a three-stage Proton rocket on July 12.</p>
        <p>Instead of the usual two-day trip to the existing station, flight controllers decided to take two weeks to move the units together so that they could thoroughly test Zvezda's systems before the docking attempt. Engineers took the time to test the command module's power and guidance systems, maneuver its giant solar power panels, and check out the docking systems.</p>
        <p>In a series of rocket firings, the final three of which occurred last Friday and Saturday, the new module moved to a 224-mile-high orbit to await the rendezvous with the space station.</p>
        <p>After all of its previous activity, Zvezda let the space station take the lead in the final stages of the rendezvous, approaching Zvezda and controlling the docking operation.</p>
        <p>The Russian control module is the third of what are to be two-dozen major components of the International Space Station, a project involving 16 nations, led by the United States.</p>
        <p>The partners, including members of the European Space Agency, Canada, Japan, Brazil and Russia, have so far spent billions of dollars building more than 300,000 pounds of equipment and supplies for the station. When completed in five years, the research outpost is to be a complex of six laboratories.</p>
        <p>Zvezda, which cost about $340 million, is the first station module fully financed by Russia. Experts said it also is one of the most essential components of the station, a necessary building block on which the rest of the outpost is constructed.</p>
        <p>Zvezda not only provides living quarters for the initial crews to staff the station, but it also is to command the station's position in space and control all electrical, computer, communications and flight systems for the complex. The module, which is almost identical to the core component of the Russian Mir space station, also will be the base for spacewalks needed to maintain the station and help in its expansion.</p>
        <p>For more than a year and a half, the station has consisted of just two components that could not be expanded without the critical service module. The Russian-made, but American-financed, control module, called Zarya, became the first part of the station launched in November 1998. The following month, an American space shuttle took up an American docking module called Unity. American shuttles visited the complex twice since then to outfit it, perform maintenance and boost the station's altitude, which slowly decreases because of atmospheric drag.</p>
