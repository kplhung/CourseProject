        <p>Ten years ago today, when the Americans With Disabilities Act became law, the unemployment rate among disabled people was 70 percent. It still is, almost everyone agrees. And the stories of Sarah Triano and Richard Clark help explain why.</p>

        <p>Ten years ago today, when the Americans With Disabilities Act became law, the unemployment rate among disabled people was 70 percent. It still is, almost everyone agrees. And the stories of Sarah Triano and Richard Clark help explain why.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark, 36, was a five-year veteran of the Chicago police force when a car crash left him almost completely paralyzed. The police department put him on leave, and he has lived on Social Security since. Mr. Clark, who uses a wheelchair and can walk with a cane, argued, however, that he could do desk work, and he sought help from Equip for Equality, an advocacy group in Chicago, which sued for Mr. Clark's reinstatement in 1997. The United States District Court dismissed his claim once, but it is now scheduled for trial in October.</p>
        <p>There are many throughout the department, Mr. Clark said, adding: ''I've done a few of them before when I was in uniform, administrative stuff, like keeping logs and records. There's no question in my mind that there is a place for me where I can continue to make a valuable contribution.''</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the Chicago police force said Mr. Clark was offered a desk job but ''he wanted to remain a sworn police officer,'' a title reserved for people who can respond to emergencies and fire their guns from a standing position. ''This is mostly where the dispute comes from,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As for Ms. Triano, she always wanted to be a lawyer, and after graduating Phi Beta Kappa from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1996, she set out to take the law school admittance exam. But a hereditary immune-system disorder makes her highly susceptible to colds and infections and prone to diarrhea and vomiting when under stress. Because of that, she had always been given access to a bathroom while taking tests in high school and college.</p>
        <p>The Law School Admission Council, which administers the Law School Admission Test, refused to grant her special privileges, she says, even after she submitted medical records from her immunologists and letters from Santa Barbara.</p>
        <p>In frustration, Ms. Triano, 25, started an Internet support group for people who had had similar problems in taking the law exams, and 50 people joined, she says. She also complained to the Justice Department, saying her rights for reasonable accommodation of her condition had been violated. As a result of similar complaints, she says, the department sued the Law School Admission Council last year in the Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia to try to force it to change its policy on accommodating students with disabilities.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the council is ''in extreme disagreement on whether or not we've violated the A.D.A.,'' said Joan E. Van Tol, its corporate counsel. ''We've complied with all the requirements'' in accommodating the complainants, she said, and ''in responding to the thousands of other test takers who have requested accommodations.''</p>
        <p>Meantime, though, the experience so upset Ms. Triano that she abandoned law and enrolled in the Ph.D. program in disability studies at the University of Illinois.</p>
        <p>''Most people with disabilities try and get into traditional employment fields like law and are getting turned down,'' Ms. Triano said. ''So they're going into a field where they can get the accommodation they need, which is in the disabled community. I've seen this happen time and again.''</p>
        <p>The frustrations that Mr. Clark and Ms. Triano have encountered mirror a larger and troubling reality: despite federal law to protect them against discrimination in hiring and promotion, and despite efforts by companies to recruit and train them and make job sites more accessible to them, the disabled continue to face a huge struggle for full workplace equality.</p>
        <p>The main reason seems to be that although the law has changed, attitudes have not. ''Clearly, many employers don't know how to level the playing field and engage people with disabilities in jobs,'' said Dr. Susanne Bruyere, director of the program on employment and disability at Cornell. ''We need to infuse all participants -- from upper management to supervisors to workers -- with new attitudes toward the one in six Americans with disabilities.''</p>
        <p>William G. Stothers, deputy director of the Center for an Accessible Society, a resource group in San Diego, says many employers are simply nervous about hiring disabled people. They wonder, he says, how much training and special attention such workers will need, whether they will be productive and how their presence will affect their colleagues.</p>
        <p>''It can be a stretch for some employers to expect a person with disability to be a valuable employee,'' Mr. Stothers said. ''That's the risk that needs taking.''</p>
        <p>Steven Odzer, the chief executive of Global Supply Net, a company in New York for the janitorial industry, says his managers sometimes question him for hiring so many mentally disabled workers. They say, ''Let's get a regular person,'' he said. ''I say, 'That is a regular person, it's just a person with a disability.' People are people, but not everyone sees that.''</p>
        <p>Another factor is the difficulty in enforcing the A.D.A. Indeed, just determining what constitutes a disability can be a problem. Obviously, paralysis and blindness qualify, but other conditions, like attention deficit disorders and alcoholism, are debated. As a result, the figures for the number of disabled Americans vary widely, though a generally accepted estimate is 54 million.</p>
        <p>Activists say adverse rulings and contradictory federal policies add to the confusion. Almost 90 percent of complaints to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission are rejected, and 98 percent of disability discrimination lawsuits are decided for the defendants, which are usually businesses, the American Bar Association says.</p>
        <p>For all the obstacles they see, though, activists mostly hail the A.D.A. as a landmark in the struggle for full acceptance. Marca Bristo, 46, chairwoman of the National Council on Disability, who is paralyzed from the neck down as a result of a diving accident but can use her hands, says that discrimination against the disabled is rampant in the workplace and that she experiences it daily. Yet, she says, the A.D.A. has had a transforming effect on her and millions of others because it gives them hope.</p>
        <p>''I've lived in three Americas,'' Ms. Bristo said. ''The first was as a nondisabled person in a world where I didn't know there was discrimination against disabled people. The second was for the 13 years after I broke my neck but before there was an A.D.A. The third has been the America I've lived in since the A.D.A. The experiences have been like three different countries.''</p>
