        <p>O. J. Simpson: More Debates</p>

        <p>O. J. Simpson: More Debates</p>
        <p>O. J. Simpson, who is in the midst of a publicity push for his new Web site, is quickly becoming the hot potato of the television news industry.</p>
        <p>Last week ''The View,'' after booking Mr. Simpson for an interview that was to take place today, canceled it amid complaints from viewers and staff members who did not think Mr. Simpson should appear on the syndicated program.</p>
        <p>Then, on Monday, after originally agreeing to interview Mr. Simpson for yesterday's edition of NBC's ''Today,'' Matt Lauer, the program's co-host, alerted producers that he did not want to take part in the segment. Executives said he came to that decision after considering over the weekend whether to do the interview. It was instead done by his co-host, Katie Couric.</p>
        <p>''He didn't feel comfortable doing it,'' said Jeff Zucker, the executive producer of ''Today.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zucker said that he allowed Mr. Lauer to excuse himself from the Simpson interview duty because ''my position, since Day 1, since I've been here, has been that I'd never put somebody in a position of doing an interview they don't feel comfortable doing.'' Ms. Couric, he added, had no objection to doing the interview.</p>
        <p>''Today'' executives did not offer many particulars on Mr. Lauer's reasons, other than to indicate that he had expressed a personal aversion to the Simpson subject and raised questions about the newsworthiness of the interview, in which Mr. Simpson was certain to plug his new Web site (as he did).</p>
        <p>For $9.95, the Web site, AskOJ.com, allows users to pose questions to Mr. Simpson, who was acquitted in the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole, and her friend, Ron Goldman but was later found liable in a wrongful-death civil suit. The site also sells memorablia relating to Mr. Simpson's football career.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lauer had plenty of company in refusing to do the interview. The producers of ABC's ''Good Morning America'' and CBS's ''Early Show'' -- both competitors of ''Today'' -- said they also declined to have Mr. Simpson on their programs.</p>
        <p>Steve Friedman, senior executive producer of the ''Early Show,'' which has Bryant Gumbel as co-host, said he declined because his interview with Mr. Simpson would have come after the one scheduled for ''Today.''</p>
        <p>''I declined because we couldn't have him first,'' Mr. Friedman said.</p>
        <p>Shelley Ross, the executive producer of ''Good Morning America,'' said she declined to have Mr. Simpson on her program because she does not believe he will offer any new information on his case.</p>
        <p>''This man is just never going to advance the story,'' said Ms. Ross, who was in charge of all prime time news magazine coverage of Mr. Simpson's criminal trial for ABC News. ''To have him come in and promote a Web page, that's something that is underneath the limbo pole of taste for me.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Zucker said he believed that Ms. Couric's interview with Mr. Simpson did break some new ground. For instance, she presented Mr. Simpson with a statement from Camp Goodtimes, one of the charities to which Mr. Simpson has said he will donate the profits from his Web site, that said: ''We have not given approval to Mr. Simpson or his representatives to use our name.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Mr. Zucker said, he believed the interview made for ''good journalism and good television.''</p>
        <p>Only a few days ago, Mr. Lauer disclosed to television journalists gathered in Pasadena, Calif., that he had fought, loudly, with Mr. Zucker earlier this year, when he was asked to do more than one interview with Darva Conger, the bride from Fox's ill-fated ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire.'' However, Mr. Lauer said, he did not refuse the assignments.</p>
        <p>Is Mr. Lauer developing an attitude? Not at all, Mr. Zucker said.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad that people feel comfortable enough to speak up,'' he said. ''That's the hallmark of an open and professional operation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Simpson's television publicity tour is scheduled to continue today. He is to appear on Court TV's ''Crier Today'' and on the Fox News Channel, which was forced to cancel separate appearances with the anchors Paula Zahn and Linda Vester yesterday. Those are scheduled to run today, instead.</p>
        <p>Roger E. Ailes, the Fox News Channel chairman and chief executive, said that because of yesterday's crash of a Concorde jet outside Paris, he believed it would have been inappropriate to go ahead with them yesterday, though he said he expects that they will be newsworthy in their own right. Mr. Simpson is also scheduled to appear on CNN's ''Burden of Proof'' tomorrow.</p>
        <p>'Early' Is Surviving</p>
        <p>After a slow start, the producers of CBS's ''Early Show,'' which made its debut in the fall, say they believe they are finally making gains in the morning television ratings race.</p>
        <p>The morning program, which is shown from 7 to 9, is still a distant third in the ratings behind its competitors, NBC's ''Today'' and ABC's ''Good Morning America.'' But it is getting a nice bump, apparently because of the popularity of CBS's new prime-time reality shows, ''Survivor,'' which has proven to be a smash hit, and ''Big Brother.''</p>
        <p>Last week, the program -- with Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson as co-hosts -- was watched in 2.1 million households, more than in any other week since March. That is considered a feat because the summer is traditionally the slowest time of the year in the television business.</p>
        <p>The program also seems to be making real gains among women ages 18 to 49. About 30 percent more women tuned into CBS between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. last week than did during that time period last year, when CBS was running ''This Morning.''</p>
        <p>''Certainly 'Big Brother' and 'Survivor' have given us a boost,'' said Mr. Friedman, the senior executive producer. ''They've opened the door, and we've kept them in the theater.''</p>
        <p>The ratings represent the best news Mr. Friedman has had in a while. The program has been slow to take off with viewers and had been struggling to draw a higher audience than the show it had replaced.</p>
        <p>Nick at 15</p>
        <p>Nick at Nite, which takes over for the Nickelodeon cable network at night, turned 15 this month. Since July 1985, from 9 p.m. to 5:30 a.m., it has been showing reruns of old sitcoms like ''Happy Days,'' ''The Brady Bunch'' and ''All in the Family.'' Watched in 1.4 million households each night, it has become the fourth-highest-rated channel in prime time on cable, after the USA, TBS and TNT networks, which are helped in the ratings by sports or wrestling.</p>
        <p>Nick at Nite will celebrate its birthday on Sunday with an anniversary special in which television producers from the days of old like Sherwood Schwartz (''The Brady Bunch,'' ''Gilligan's Island'') introduce their favorite episodes.</p>
