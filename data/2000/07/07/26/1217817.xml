        <p>AT&amp;T reported quarterly earnings yesterday that modestly exceeded analysts' expectations. But the company's revenue growth continued to slow amid deepening erosion in the core consumer long-distance business.</p>
        <p>For all of the complexity of AT&amp;T, the nation's No. 1 long-distance carrier and No. 1 cable television provider, its overall financial picture is relatively simple. While some of the company's newer operations, including wireless, are performing well, the shrinking of the consumer long-distance business makes it difficult to show satisfactory growth.</p>
        <p>And in some ways that task is expected to become even tougher through the end of 2001 because AT&amp;T will lose the ability to use its fast-growing wireless unit to buoy its overall financial results. As AT&amp;T distributes its remaining 84 percent stake in the separately traded AT&amp;T Wireless Group to its own shareholders, the parent company will stop consolidating the wireless unit's results into its own.</p>
        <p>At the same time, AT&amp;T has been able to exceed Wall Street earnings projections modestly, at least in part because of aggressive cost-cutting.</p>
        <p>But that path will not be sustainable indefinitely. At some point, earnings growth must emerge not from lower costs but from the introduction of higher-profit services and, preferably, from robust increases in revenue. If the strategy that C. Michael Armstrong, AT&amp;T's chairman, has mapped out for the company's future is to succeed, the revenue growth will soon have to emerge from AT&amp;T's cable unit, and in force.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the company's depressed stock price appears to be drawing it ever closer to creating additional spinoffs along the lines of the new shares AT&amp;T issued earlier this year to track the wireless unit. In a conference call with analysts yesterday, Mr. Armstrong responded to a question about a possible spin-out of the consumer long-distance business by mentioning some of the positive effects such a move would have.</p>
        <p>''The enterprise share price doesn't represent the asset values that we have,'' he said, ''nor the growth that we're scaling.'' Without the consumer unit, he said, AT&amp;T could be seen as a $42 billion company growing at 12 percent.</p>
        <p>''There's not that many enterprises of this size hanging around that have that kind of growth and scaling as we go into 2001,'' Mr. Armstrong added.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T gained 75 cents yesterday, to close at $34.0625, in New York Stock Exchange trading of 34.2 million shares.</p>
        <p>Investors seemed somewhat encouraged that, excluding special charges, the company earned $1.88 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the second quarter. That was more than 16 percent higher than earnings of 49 cents a share in the corresponding period a year earlier and 4 cents higher than the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/ Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>Charles H. Noski, AT&amp;T's chief financial officer, predicted that earnings in the current quarter, excluding special charges, would be 40 to 43 cents, higher than the 37 cent estimate of First Call analysts.</p>
        <p>But despite the numbers, the second quarter did not reflect any gangbusters operational performance. In an interview, Mr. Noski said that about 2 cents of the second-quarter earnings were a result of higher interest income on AT&amp;T's cash investments. Some analysts also credited the company's success in trying to eliminate $2 billion in costs this year.</p>
        <p>Yet in the second quarter, AT&amp;T showed its worst quarterly revenue growth in almost two years. Adjusting for the impact of the acquisitions of MediaOne and the I.B.M. global data network, the company had pro forma revenue growth of 4.5 percent, to $16.9 billion. In the second quarter of 1999, pro forma revenue growth was 6.7 percent.</p>
        <p>The culprit last quarter was, as usual, the consumer long-distance unit, where sales shrank more than 7 percent, to $5 billion from $5.4 billion in the 1999 period. In quarters past, AT&amp;T's unit serving business customers could be counted on to pick up the slack, but that unit stumbled earlier this year as it tried to transfer some big corporate customers to Concert, AT&amp;T's joint venture with British Telecommunications. In the second quarter, revenue from the business-services unit grew only 4 percent, to $6.9 billion, and the company said yesterday that the business unit would grow 6 percent this year rather than the roughly 8 percent it had sought.</p>
        <p>Revenue from the AT&amp;T cable unit grew by a strong 10.5 percent, to $2.4 billion, last quarter. To meet its targets, AT&amp;T by the end of the year must provide local phone service over cable lines to at least 300,000 more homes in areas previously served by Tele-Communications Inc. Including areas previously served by MediaOne, the company is already delivering such service to a quarter-million homes across the nation.</p>
        <p>Including all special charges, AT&amp;T reported earnings of $1.75 billion, or 53 cents a share, for the quarter, up from $1.59 billion, or 49 cents, in the second quarter of 1999. Revenue was $16.22 billion, up from $15.75 billion .</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T Wireless reported impressive results yesterday. Revenue increased almost 32 percent from the second quarter of 1999, to $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion. Earnings more than doubled to $200 million from $75 million.</p>
        <p>The AT&amp;T Wireless Group rose $1.4375 yesterday, to $28.50, in trading of more than 12.5 million shares. The tracking stock was offered to the public late in April at a share price of $29.50.</p>
