        <p>Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that the central bank's decision about whether to raise interest rates again at its meeting next month would hinge in large part on economic data released in coming weeks.</p>
        <p>Repeating a message he delivered to the Senate Banking Committee last week, Mr. Greenspan told the House Banking Committee that higher rates were starting to slow the economy and reduce the risk of inflation, an analysis that has fed hope in financial markets that the Fed is finished or nearly finished raising rates.</p>

        <p>Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that the central bank's decision about whether to raise interest rates again at its meeting next month would hinge in large part on economic data released in coming weeks.</p>
        <p>Repeating a message he delivered to the Senate Banking Committee last week, Mr. Greenspan told the House Banking Committee that higher rates were starting to slow the economy and reduce the risk of inflation, an analysis that has fed hope in financial markets that the Fed is finished or nearly finished raising rates.</p>
        <p>But the Fed chairman said the extent of the slowdown remained unclear, and he seemed to warn investors not to assume that the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee would make no changes when it meets on Aug. 22.</p>
        <p>Reports in the next few weeks on the unemployment rate, job creation, compensation costs, the growth rate and inflation ''will have a significant effect upon what action the committee chooses to take,'' Mr. Greenspan said.</p>
        <p>At the meeting in August, he said, ''we will make a judgment as to whether or not further action or no action is the more appropriate policy for the purpose of creating a more balanced economy which has the capacity to continue this quite extraordinary 112-month expansion.''</p>
        <p>The Fed has raised its benchmark short-term Federal funds rate by 1.75 percentage points in six steps since June 1999, to 6.5 percent, in an effort to squelch inflation pressures before they take root in the economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan's comments came on a day in which two economic indicators came in slightly stronger than analysts had expected.</p>
        <p>Existing-home sales increased 2.8 percent in June, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.23 million. And the consumer confidence index published by the Conference Board, a business research group, increased to 141.7 in July, up from 139.2 in June, but still below the record level of 144.7 in January and May.</p>
        <p>Asked about the consumer confidence numbers today, Mr. Greenspan said it was ''clear that consumer confidence remains quite high in this country, and that despite the evidence of some slowing down in consumer buying, we're not confronted with a buyers' strike by any remote sense of the meaning.''</p>
        <p>In his appearance before the House committee, Mr. Greenspan repeated the prepared testimony he had delivered to the Senate panel last week, and answered questions for nearly three hours.</p>
        <p>Asked about transcripts of Fed meetings in 1994 that portray him as eager to bring stock prices down, Mr. Greenspan said he had subsequently decided that monetary policy should not be aimed at Wall Street.</p>
        <p>He said the rapidly increasing trade deficit was not an immediate threat because foreigners were eager to get their hands on dollars to invest in the United States, but he said that in the long run the issue was ''probably the most difficult one'' facing economic policy makers.</p>
        <p>''At some point something has to give,'' Mr. Greenspan said, referring to the trade and current account deficits and the dollar, which so far has remained quite strong.</p>
        <p>''We don't know whether it will be protracted over a very long period of time, in which case the adjustments will occur in the normal manner without any significance, or whether they'll occur more abruptly,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan also had a series of spirited exchanges with Democrats on the committee about whether the economy and globalization are leaving too many people behind.</p>
        <p>The Fed chairman said that the booming economy had helped reverse a decline in real incomes at the bottom of the economic ladder, and that incomes had been growing since the mid-1990's. He said it was important to recognize that globalization created economic dislocation, and to help those who had lost jobs or otherwise suffered economically because of the changes created by global markets, but that its benefits far outweighed its drawbacks, especially for the United States.</p>
        <p>Challenged on whether the government should do more to help people adapt to the rapid economic changes, Mr. Greenspan said job training programs were often unsuccessful, and that the best solution was to create more jobs.</p>
        <p>''There is no substitute for getting people employed,'' he said. ''The most important thing that we as a government can do to enhance the economic capabilities of the lesser-skilled people in this country and the inner cities is to keep this economic growth going.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Greenspan said there were always going to be some people out of work by choice or as they change jobs. And he suggested that he does not view the Federal Reserve or the government as capable of eradicating all economic problems, even amid the nation's longest business expansion ever.</p>
        <p>Asked by Representative Barbara Lee, a Democrat from California, what he would say to people who cannot afford to buy a home because of the surge in real estate prices and mortgage rates, Mr. Greenspan said the problem was not easily resolved.</p>
        <p>''I wish I could say to you I have a program which will either knock $100,000 off every home or raise incomes by some specific amount,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''The world is not the way we'd always like it to be.''</p>
