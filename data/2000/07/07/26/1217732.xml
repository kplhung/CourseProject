        <p>The Vans Warped Tour, which came to Randalls Island on Monday for a sixth-anniversary show, asks the question, what is punk besides an explosion?

But punk's bomb has gone off intermittently for over two decades, and its adherents stay alive within the rubble.

        <p>The Vans Warped Tour, which came to Randalls Island on Monday for a sixth-anniversary show, asks the question, what is punk besides an explosion? The music and the lifestyle intertwined with it were designed to rip apart routines, in the rock scene and in the larger culture. But punk's bomb has gone off intermittently for over two decades, and its adherents stay alive within the rubble. They form a society of outcasts, the teenagers (and, eventually, adults) who don't conform to standards of beauty, power and propriety, and support each other as they fight to stay true to themselves.</p>
        <p>This year's quintessential Warped tour attendee was a girl in a leopard-skin dog collar, blue-streaked hair, a worn T-shirt and droopy fatigues, with ''Dork'' written in felt pen across her backpack between the badges advertising bands from the Sex Pistols to Green Day. Such teen angels of Warped, male and female, looked shy and diffident despite their sartorial boldness as they eyed potential dates, shared fried dough and cigarettes and sought out their high school cliques.</p>
        <p>''I see so much hope in this crowd,'' said  Justin Sane, singer for the Pittsburgh band Anti-Flag, early in the day. Punk has always been associated with hope as well as destructiveness, and as it has matured, it has become a main outlet for healthy contrary thinking. Hardcore, the punk style that dominates this tour, encourages life choices like vegetarianism and straight-edge sobriety. The connected style of ska-punk adds interracial utopianism to the ideal.</p>
        <p>At Warped, concertgoers could buy T-shirts decrying racism and sexism and listen to bands express social protest as well as simple, good-natured rowdiness. Although the number of women and non-white artists remained small, the mood in the air was open and progressive. Artists passed down wisdom to the eager audience. Be good to each other, was the day's refrain, uttered by nearly every singer on the main stage to dissuade excited young fans from demolishing each other in the mosh pits.</p>
        <p>Dicky Barrett, the jocular frontman for the veteran ska troopers the Mighty Bosstones, gave a hands-on lesson in skanking, the ska dance style, by inviting as many fans as could cram onstage as he sang his group's biggest hit, ''The Impression that I Get.'' That song, incidentally, was recorded for a compilation supporting abortion rights activism, an example of millennial punk's mix of festivity and social awareness.</p>
        <p>As one would expect at a summer festival, merriment often won out over any serious thinking. Allotted a half-hour each, the main-stage bands did what would get the crowd going fastest.</p>
        <p>Green Day, this year's biggest stars, frenetically played its assortment of hits in a set that ended with the drummer Tre Cool's setting his kit on fire. The singer Billie Joe Armstrong did engage in some mentorship: inviting a spiky-haired fan onstage, he strapped a guitar to the boy, had him play a song, and then commanded him to stage-dive.</p>
        <p>The fan did fine during his rock-star debut, which couldn't have been too difficult. Hardcore and ska are formulaic, and another reason this year's Warped tour felt like summer school was that its musical offerings were fairly uniform. The underground hip hop crew Jurassic Five showed its genius during a set that featured a brief appearance by Green Day's Tre Cool, but it was an anomaly on the main stage.</p>
        <p>The Toledo Show, an offbeat soul revue, performed twice in the minuscule Tiki Tent. Flogging Molly, a Pogues-inspired Celtic punk band, added accordion, fiddle and tin whistle to the mix on the third stage. The Long Beach Dub All Stars mixed reggae and hip hop with hardcore during its laid-back set. One Minute Silence, an English band that played on the third stage to barely anyone during the main stage set by the hardcore elders NOFX, brought the rap-metal sound that was undoubtedly wowing thousands at Ozzfest, happening simultaneously at PNC Bank Arts Center in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>These hints of variety were overwhelmed by the three-chord pound of basic hardcore and ska-punk. Whether it was rendered with passion by Snapcase, Kill Your Idols, and Hot Water Music, with infectious humor by NOFX, the Dub All Stars, Save Ferris, and Simon Has No Pants, or performed by the numbers by MxPx, Good Riddance, and CKY, the formula at Warped was disappointingly fixed. In recent years, artists like Eminem and Rancid have shown intense artistry at Warped. But this year, with pop-punk hardly registering in general and the show's veteran artists treating the tour as if it were a relaxing vacation, Warped offered little in the way of musical thrills.</p>
        <p>So the bands became background, in a strange way, to the skateboarding demonstrations, the shopping for T-shirts, the mingling with artists who treated the stage as if it were a party site fans could crash. The Warped Tour has long offered evidence that being a punk extends beyond playing or listening to the music. This year it made that point so strongly, the music hardly seemed to matter.</p>
