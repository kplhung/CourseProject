        <p>The National Football League's broadcast committee has approved a one-year experiment to expand the number of Sunday afternoon doubleheaders that can be seen when local teams are playing home games.</p>
        <p>Each week, CBS or Fox broadcasts games in the early and late afternoon time slots (1 p.m. and 4 Eastern), while the other carries a single game.</p>
        <p>The league has barred doubleheaders in markets when the local team plays at home. Those markets got one network's game at 1 o'clock and another is at 4.</p>
        <p>The change is part of a league plan to showcase games that would not ordinarily be seen, which is especially important where home teams are playing badly, and to help networks increase their ratings.</p>
        <p>''It's certainly an advantage,'' said Terry Ewert, executive producer of CBS Sports.</p>
        <p>Under the change, a third game will be shown in a market if the local team's home game is sold out 72 hours in advance and at a time that does not conflict with the home game.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 3, for example, CBS is the doubleheader network. In Pittsburgh, viewers will see the Ravens-Steelers game at 1 p.m., then Fox's Philadelphia-Dallas game and CBS's Jets-Green Bay telecast at 4. Previously, Pittsburgh fans would not have seen the Jets-Green Bay game.</p>
        <p>The doubleheader rule is more complicated in a two-team market like New York or San Francisco/Oakland. A third game has only been seen on Sunday afternoons when the Jets and the Giants were both on the road, or one played an away game while another played Sunday or Monday nights or had a bye.</p>
        <p>Last season in the New York market, there were five Sunday afternoons in New York with three games. The rule change will increase that figure to 11.</p>
        <p>The broadcast committee also approved the use of tiny cameras mounted on the bill of the umpires' caps during nine preseason games. The umpcams were used successfully by Fox during the N.F.L. Europe's World Bowl broadcast.</p>
        <p>''The ump's job is to watch the quarterback; he can't take his eyes off the line of scrimmage,'' Ewert said.''So he will stay steady unless he's knocked down.''</p>
        <p>If theumpcams succeed in preseason, the league may use them during the regular season.</p>

        <p>DENVER</p>
        <p>Cyron Brown of the Broncos was suspended by the N.F.L. for one season yesterday for violating the league's substance abuse policy.</p>
        <p>The league said the 6-foot-5-inch, 275-pound defensive tackle can apply for reinstatement following the 2000 season. Coach Mike Shanahan said he had known for about two weeks that Brown would be suspended. He declined to elaborate on the violation.</p>
        <p>''He's not coming back here, I will say that,'' Shanahan said.</p>

        <p>BALTIMORE</p>
        <p>After a one-day holdout, Ravens punter Kyle Richardson signed and returned to training camp yesterday.</p>
        <p>Richardson, who set an N.F.L. record last season with 39 punts inside the 20-yard line, signed for one year at $385,000. As an exclusive-rights player, Richardson could not negotiate with any other team and could play only for the Ravens for the 2000 season.</p>
        <p>The punter is beginning his fourth season in the N.F.L. and third with the Ravens. (AP)</p>
        <p>SAN FRANCISCO</p>
        <p>Safety Lance Schulters showed up at the 49ers' training camp Monday after missing the first six days and amassing $30,000 in fines. Schulters, a Pro Bowl starter last season, blamed his absence on bad timing and miscommunication -- and a change of agents.</p>
        <p>He fired his agent Alan Herman and hired Steve Weinberg last week. There is a league-mandated transition time of several days in switching agents, and the 49ers said they would not negotiate with anyone until Schulters came to camp.</p>
        <p>''I really wasn't holding out,'' said Schulters, a fourth-round pick out of Hofstra in 1998. ''I was waiting for them to talk to my agent. I couldn't officially hire him until Saturday.''(AP)</p>
