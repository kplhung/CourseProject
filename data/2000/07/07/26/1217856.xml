        <p>Bad luck has plagued the Concorde, the world's only supersonic passenger jet, from the day it began development as a British-French joint venture in 1962. But until yesterday there was one area where its record, by modern aviation standards, was pristine: safety.</p>
        <p>The fatal crash of Air France Flight 4590, a charter from Paris to New York, was the first of a Concorde after more than 30 years of flying, an unusually long stretch for any type of commercial aircraft.</p>
        <p>Since Air France and British Airways began scheduled service between Paris or London and New York in the late 1970's, the distinctive needle-nosed Concorde with its swept-back delta wing has carried more than four million passengers. Its manifests regularly contain celebrity names from the worlds of business, entertainment, sports and fashion who pay as much as $11,000 for a round-trip ticket.</p>
        <p>But the Concorde, hailed as the plane of the future in the 1960's, has become a high-tech orphan. Only 20 were built because airlines refused to buy them. By today's standards, it is too noisy and its engine exhaust too dirty, which is why it is barred from flying regularly to all but a handful of airports.</p>
        <p>The advantage of squeezing into a Concorde seat, which offers less room than business class on slower jets like the Boeing 777, is the ability to cruise at 1,350 miles an hour 11 miles above earth, twice as fast and twice as high as typical subsonic jetliners. Passengers never feel the weariness of time-zone changes known as jet lag, Air France boasts, because the transatlantic trip takes only three and a half hours.</p>
        <p>But in recent years the Concordes in commercial service -- all built in the 1970's or early 1980's -- had begun to show their age. On Monday, the two airlines reported that microscopic cracks had been discovered on the wings of several planes. British Airways took one out of service, but Air France said the cracks posed no threat to safety.</p>
        <p>It is still far too early to conclude why Flight 4590 went down. There are many possibilities, and many may be completely unrelated to the Concorde's age or its unique design. Indeed, by the standard of many commercial airplanes, the Concorde is considered young because each flies fewer than 1,000 hours annually. By contrast, there are more than 1,200 Boeing 747's, and they fly thousands of hours a year.</p>
        <p>The aircraft that crashed yesterday had flown only 11,989 hours since it entered service in 1980, and had undergone its most recent heavy maintenance overhaul on April 28, Air France said.</p>
        <p>One difference between the Concorde and other aging planes, though, is that in the other models produced by the hundreds over many years, the oldest are like sentinels, forewarning of problems with the younger ones. In contrast, there are only 13 Concordes, counting the one that crashed.</p>
        <p>''They were all built around same period of time, and whatever happens to one is probably going to happen to all of them, about the same time,'' said James G. Ladesic, a professor of aerospace engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla. ''It's a little scary.''</p>
        <p>Supersonic flight at high altitude also places different stresses on the Concorde than those experienced by subsonic aircraft. For instance, the rush of passing air on supersonic planes heats the skin above the boiling point, which can weaken the airplane's construction.</p>
        <p>That may be what happened to a section of the lower rudder on a British Airways Concorde bound for New York from London that fell off in flight on Oct. 9, 1998; the plane landed safely in New York. It is one of several occasions in which tail pieces have fallen off. In May 1998, a British Airways Concorde lost a section of an elevon, a device on the tail used to make the nose point up or down.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Concorde, like other supersonic planes, has a history of wheel and tire problems, and those can lead to fires. The Concorde's V-shape optimizes it for flying fast enough to break the sound barrier, but it also requires the planes to fly about 50 percent faster on landing and takeoff than is typical for subsonic passenger jets.</p>
        <p>That heats up the tires. After takeoff, when they are retracted into the wheel well, which is crammed with hydraulic lines, the fluid could be in danger of igniting.</p>
        <p>''The wheel wells on supersonic airplanes are a pretty tight fit,'' said Charles N. Eastlake, a professor of aerospace engineering at Embry-Riddle. ''If you've got a blown tire and you retract the landing gear, the shredded parts of blown tire are more certain to hit something inside the wheel well.''</p>
        <p>In 1981, after Concordes blew out tires on four occasions over 20 months at Dulles and Kennedy International Airports, the American National Transportation Safety Board warned Air France that pilots should not retract landing gear with blown tires. The French complied.</p>
        <p>American aviation experts said yesterday that the pictures of the plume of fire behind Flight 4590 might have indicated the Concorde's use of an afterburner, a feature common on high-performance fighter jets but unique to a passenger jet. Those devices squirt fuel into the engine exhaust to create extra thrust. If an engine had a mechanical failure, and the pilot continued to operate it, far more fuel could burn.</p>
        <p>''If there's some massive failure in the engine and everything has turned to mechanical confusion, then the total amount of fuel there is dramatically bigger,'' said Mr. Eastlake of Embry-Riddle.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ladesic pointed out that even if an engine was on fire, it was not necessarily the cause of the crash. ''There may be other systems that were affected, such as control systems or flaps,'' he said. ''If one is sitting around speculating, any of those could have caused them to lose their ability to climb.''</p>
        <p>The Concorde was conceived at a time when people believed that there would be Pan Am shuttles to the moon by the year 2001. The British and French reluctantly joined forces to build the supersonic transport because they feared that the Americans and Russians would build them, leaving Europe behind.</p>
        <p>In the end, the Americans gave up when Congress cut the financing in 1971. The Soviet Tupolev 144, which was based on the design of the Concorde after Soviet agents stole the plans, crashed at the Paris Air Show in 1973, ending that program.</p>
        <p>By the early 1970's, the Concorde stood alone. The British and the French needed to sell 300 to recoup their $3 billion investment. Sixteen airlines had placed orders for 74 of the jets, which was a promising start. Then oil prices shot up in 1973. The orders dried up.</p>
        <p>The Concorde was eventually given to British Airways and Air France, both then state-owned, but they had trouble finding destinations because of protests about noise.  Scheduled service to New York finally began in 1977 after the United States Supreme Court struck down a decision by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to ban the jets from landing at Kennedy Airport. British Airways now also offers regular flights between London and Barbados during the winter months.</p>
        <p>Controversy about the Concorde has faded in recent years, and it has became a profitable niche for both airlines. Though maintenance costs for the jets are four times as high as those for a subsonic jet, the airlines still make a profit on the Concorde.</p>
        <p>''Both British Airways and Air France wouldn't fly this plane for two seconds if it was losing money,'' said Donald L. Pevsner, an aviation attorney and tour operator who has chartered the Concorde several times.</p>
        <p>THE CONCORD CRASH: THE SUPERSONIC AIRLINER  Correction:  July 27, 2000, Thursday  A chart yesterday with articles about the crash of a Concorde jet near Paris referred incorrectly to the precedents. While this was the first crash of a Concorde, it was not the first of a supersonic airliner; a Soviet Tupolev 144 crashed at the Paris Air Show in 1973, and another crashed on a test flight in 1978.</p>
        <p>A related article, about the history of the Concorde, misstated the last year in which the Tupolev 144 flew. After the 1973 crash, the plane was used for mail and cargo service starting in 1975, and briefly for passenger service in 1977 and 1978.</p>
