        <p>Status report from Shea Stadium: a careful check of the names and numbers above the lockers in the home clubhouse yesterday revealed no ''11 Larkin.''</p>
        <p>The object of the Mets' most recent trade obviously did not accept the deal the Mets made for him with the Cincinnati Reds. Steve Phillips, the Mets' man with a telephone attached to each ear, said he received a message on his cell phone Monday from Jim Bowden, the Reds' general manager, with an explanation. ''The owner got involved,'' Phillips quoted Bowden as saying.</p>
        <p>Todd Zeile had another take on the Larkin development, but back to the status report.</p>
        <p>A couple of steps into the visiting clubhouse and it was obvious that Rondell White remains a member of the Montreal Expos. But for how long?</p>
        <p>''I've been traded to the Yankees; I've heard I'm going to Colorado, Seattle, a number of teams,'' White said, one foot resting on the stool in front of his locker. So why is he still wearing that Montreal uniform? He laughed.</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' he said. ''I just go day by day. I like it here. I like my teammates. But the way the talk is, I think I'm gone. My gut feeling, I think I'm gone. I realize I could be gone when I come off the D.L. That's what my agent and everybody is telling me.''</p>
        <p>White, the Expos left fielder when he doesn't have an ailing hamstring, was eligible to come off the disabled list Sunday, could return to active duty tomorrow. Next Tuesday night, the day after the deadline for trades without waivers, White could be playing left field against Kansas City at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>A baseball official with knowledge of the White trade talks said last night that he could be traded as soon as he becomes active and he could be traded to the Yankees. He said the Yankees have told the Expos they would trade Alfonso Soriano, their top minor league prospect, for White.</p>
        <p>''If I was to get traded,'' White said, ''who wouldn't want to be a Yankee? Everybody wants to be a champion. Everybody wants to have a chance to make the playoffs. It's a compliment that the world champions are interested in me.''</p>
        <p>Some of his teammates teased White before the Expos lost to the Mets, 5-0, last night in the first of a three-game series.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we'll just leave you here,'' they told him.</p>
        <p>An outfielder is low on the Mets' priority list. Curt Schilling is at the top. Not that Phillips dared utter his name. A general manager risks a tampering charge if he publicly covets another team's player. But the Mets are one of five teams Schilling has told the Philadelphia Phillies he would approve a trade.</p>
        <p>''There's probably one obvious starting pitcher out there who could impact our starting pitching in a way that we would look for,'' Phillips said without naming Schilling. ''Every other starter that could be available, I can't honestly predict that their performance would be better than the guys we currently have.''</p>
        <p>Will the team for whom that pitcher works actually trade him? ''It's unclear whether they're going to do something or not,'' Phillips said.</p>
        <p>The Atlanta Braves, the team that renders the Mets a candidate for the wild-card slot in the playoffs, have already acquired a starting pitcher, Andy Ashby. Does Phillips feel pressure to make a move or two?</p>
        <p>''Only because I want to,'' said the general manager, who was acutely active a year ago. ''It's something I really want to do. It's more self-inflicted. The players make comments like 'we think we're good enough,' but you want to get better. Part of it is you know your competition also is trying to improve. You can't necessarily anticipate what they're going to do, but you have to assume they're going to do something to get better. You want to strengthen your weakness but also keep up with what everyone else is doing.''</p>
        <p>Sitting in the Mets' dugout, Phillips was asked if the team can reach the playoffs without bolstering the lineup or the pitching rotation or the bullpen. ''I think if we get healthy we're a playoff team,'' he said. ''I think we have the talent to get to the playoffs if we don't do anything. We're going to continue to work until the end to try to improve because that's what we're supposed to try to do.''</p>
        <p>How do the players feel about the need to add a player or two?</p>
        <p>''The teams I was on that won world championships, they always made a move or two,'' said Al Leiter of the 1992 and '93 Blue Jays and the 1997 Marlins. ''In '97 Darren Daulton got us over the hump not only as a player but with his leadership. In '93 they brought in Rickey Henderson and Tony Fernandez. In '92 they brought in David Cone and Candy Maldonado. It was always that one or two ingredients.''</p>
        <p>Leiter said players would welcome a player who could ''substantially help the team win.''</p>
        <p>''Even me as a starting pitcher,'' he added. ''If they said they were bringing in Kevin Brown, Greg Maddux and Randy Johnson but 'oh, by the way, you're not going to pitch the rest of the year,' I'd go to the bullpen and watch these guys pitch.''</p>
        <p>Larkin would have helped, the players agreed. But Zeile never envisioned the shortstop in a Mets uniform.</p>
        <p>''It seemed like he was using that situation to up his negotiability with the Reds,'' Zeile said. ''It turned out that's what he was doing.''</p>
        <p>But Zeile also saw the Reds general manager acting similarly from his end. ''He was certainly adamant about making public how much money he wanted, how the Mets should do it,'' the first baseman said. ''That drove the fans to show their support for Barry and then the owner.''</p>
        <p>That's why no locker in the Mets' clubhouse was labeled ''11 Larkin.''</p>
