        <p>General Manager Steve Phillips sat comfortably in the first-base dugout at Shea Stadium, answering questions about his wishes and his hopes for making the Mets better. Phillips never mentioned Curt Schilling's name, but he talked about a specific starting pitcher who would immediately improve the Mets, and it was obvious that he was referring to Schilling.</p>
        <p>Glendon Rusch is not Curt Schilling. When you mention Schilling to Rusch, the 25-year-old Mets left-hander gets an innocent look because he knows Schilling is in another echelon. Still, four hours after Phillips discussed a superb pitcher without mentioning his name, Rusch was the only pitcher worth mentioning in the clubhouse last night because he had just guided the Mets to a 5-0 victory over the Montreal Expos.</p>

        <p>General Manager Steve Phillips sat comfortably in the first-base dugout at Shea Stadium, answering questions about his wishes and his hopes for making the Mets better. Phillips never mentioned Curt Schilling's name, but he talked about a specific starting pitcher who would immediately improve the Mets, and it was obvious that he was referring to Schilling.</p>
        <p>Glendon Rusch is not Curt Schilling. When you mention Schilling to Rusch, the 25-year-old Mets left-hander gets an innocent look because he knows Schilling is in another echelon. Still, four hours after Phillips discussed a superb pitcher without mentioning his name, Rusch was the only pitcher worth mentioning in the clubhouse last night because he had just guided the Mets to a 5-0 victory over the Montreal Expos.</p>
        <p>Rusch's results were as impressive as those Schilling or any other pitcher could have provided; on a night in which Rusch felt listless, he still stopped Montreal on three hits over seven innings. While Rusch did not have a crisp repertory and walked four batters, as many as he had walked in his preceding six starts, he pushed and plodded on this windy night until he succeeded.</p>
        <p>''He's a determined young man who wants to make his mark,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''He works harder between starts to get better. He's been a godsend for us.''</p>
        <p>It is easy to overlook how dependable Rusch has been at the back end of the Mets' rotation.</p>
        <p>Remember, he came into the season with a 12-25 career record and was not even guaranteed to be in the majors.  Rusch is quiet and he does not throw hard, but he has worked at least six innings in 15 of his 18 starts, he has allowed three earned runs or less 13 times and he is a deceiving 7-7.</p>
        <p>''I don't think anyone would have predicted Glendon to be the kind of pitcher he has been for us,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Except for Rusch. Sort of. ''I had confidence going into spring training,'' Rusch said. ''I thought I could help the team. It's tough to predict what you can do in a season. But I thought I could help the team every time out there.''</p>
        <p>When reporters pumped questions at Phillips about trade possibilities, the general manager said that his priority was acquiring a pitcher, and he added that he was working on potential deals that he called ''big ones.''</p>
        <p>Schilling has a no-trade clause in his contract, but the Mets are one of five teams he would waive it for.</p>
        <p>''We have a couple of big ones we're working on,'' Phillips said. ''Whether they happen or not, it's hard to say. It's up to the other team.''</p>
        <p>If the Mets were ever fortunate enough to obtain Schilling -- and they would surely have to start their offer with the prospects Alex Escobar and Grant Roberts -- Rusch or Bobby J. Jones would be removed from the rotation. Rusch is not worried about trades.</p>
        <p>''You can't get caught up in that,'' Rusch said. ''Obviously, his job is to try and better our ball club. If we get another starting pitcher, what can I do? You have to be prepared to throw the ball, if it's out of the bullpen or if it's any other way I get a chance to pitch.''</p>
        <p>Rusch was cruising with a 4-0 cushion when he sputtered in the fifth last night, walked two batters and allowed Milton Bradley's bloop single.</p>
        <p>It was a delicate point, but Rusch got Jose Vidro, a .359 hitter, to ground into a forceout at home plate.</p>
        <p>Geoff Blum followed with a line drive on which Melvin Mora darted behind second base, grabbed the ball and turned in a nifty double play. While Rusch was erratic, he did not allow the Expos a hit in three at-bats with runners in scoring position.</p>
        <p>When the Mets listed the names of the starters on the scoreboard before the game, they referred to Dustin Hermanson as Chad Hermanson. It was a weird mistake because Dustin Hermanson had dominated the Mets with a 4-1 victory six days ago. But Hermanson would not have minded disguising his identity after he was cuffed for four runs and nine hits in four ugly innings.</p>
        <p>Mike Piazza had three singles and two runs batted against Hermanson as the Mets gave Rusch a comfort zone.</p>
        <p>Rusch, who felt out of sync, took care of the rest.</p>
        <p>Now, like the rest of the Mets, Rusch will wait and see if he has any new teammates by Monday's trading deadline.</p>
        <p>''It's about winning now,'' Phillips said. ''We're in a position to get to the playoffs. You don't know how often that happens. If you're in that position, you have to go for it.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>RONDELL WHITE's Montreal teammates teasingly asked him if he wanted them to simply leave him in New York, referring to speculation that the left fielder could be traded to the Yankees or the Mets. White called it nerve-racking and exciting to have his name mentioned and added, ''I think something is going to happen.'' . . . EDGARDO ALFONZO (sore right hip) returned to the starting lineup and went 1 for 5. . . . DARRYL HAMILTON (big left toe) will join the Mets this week and begin a minor league rehab stint. . . . Although ROBIN VENTURA (right shoulder) spoke optimistically about returning on Saturday, BOBBY VALENTINE doubted Ventura would be ready by then.</p>
