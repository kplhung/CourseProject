        <p>These are the times when you cannot wait to get to the ballpark, Paul O'Neill was saying tonight. You cannot wait to swing a bat, you know your starting pitcher is probably going to throw well. You cannot wait to win, again.</p>
        <p>The trades the Yankees have made in the last month are restoring them to the prominence to which they are accustomed: first place, the margin from the pack ever growing, and the enjoyment of one-sided wipeouts, like the 19-1 destruction of the Baltimore Orioles tonight.</p>
        <p>The Yankees banged out a season-high 20 hits, including five homers. O'Neill drove in six runs, Bernie Williams five and Jose Vizcaino contributed four hits while starting in place of the injured second baseman Chuck Knoblauch. Andy Pettitte threw seven shutout innings and became the team's first 10-game winner. The only Orioles run was generated by a player the Yankees are trying to acquire: B. J. Surhoff, who hit an eighth-inning homer.</p>
        <p>''It seems like all the aspects of our game are clicking in,'' Williams said. ''Great pitching performances, hitting with men in scoring position, everything is coming together.''</p>
        <p>They have won three consecutive games, 15 of their last 21. They averaged a little more than five runs a game before the All-Star Game break, and since that three-day respite, their average is almost seven a game, 90 runs in 13 games.</p>
        <p>That total is padded by what they accomplished tonight, of course -- the Orioles' worst loss at home since Camden Yards opened in 1992, the second-greatest margin of defeat in Baltimore history. The Yankees' offense snowballed, scoring a run in the first, three in third, four more in the fourth inning. Derek Jeter slammed a two-run homer in the sixth, and Williams crushed a grand slam in the seventh to make the score 16-0; Manager Joe Torre then replaced some of his regulars.</p>
        <p>But they scored a run in the eighth and two more in the ninth, the last on Clay Bellinger's home run, to whoops from the fans who remained, most of them of the pinstriped persuasion. The Yankees were trying not to have too much fun, trying not to show up the Orioles, but they just kept pounding out hits, against Scott Erickson (5-8) and the four relievers who followed.</p>
        <p>''I don't think anybody likes to score this many runs,'' Torre said. ''You're happy when Bellinger hits a home run, and Bernie hits a grand slam. You love to see players, even when we're ahead by a lot of runs, to not just go through the motions. It's a Catch-22: you want to see guys knock in a lot of runs, but you don't want to beat the heck out of anybody.''</p>
        <p>Their collective confidence is growing, as they thrive individually. The Los Angeles Dodgers packaged Vizcaino and $500,000 in cash to convince the Yankees to take him, in return for Jim Leyritz. Vizcaino is helping the Yankees, wearing protective goggles that no image-conscious high school student would ever be caught wearing in gym class. Making his 13th start at second base for the Yankees, Vizcaino went 4 for 5 and scored four runs against the Orioles. He has yet to make an error in 25 games with the Yankees. ''That's been a great acquisition for us,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Vizcaino said, ''So far I've done a good job, and Joe's given me the chance.''</p>
        <p>Williams could surpass 100 runs batted in before the end of July. He has 94 now, with five more games to play in the month, and he is only 36 short of tying the single-season record for R.B.I. by a switch-hitter, a mark shared by Mickey Mantle and Ken Caminiti.</p>
        <p>''I'm just trying to focus on keep playing hard, and whatever happens at the end of the year -- right now is not the time to sit back and admire what I've done so far,'' Williams said. ''Now is the time to keep performing.''</p>
        <p>The trade for Vizcaino drastically cut into Bellinger's playing time, and he really had no reason to think he would start in this series. But Torre inserted him against the Baltimore left-hander John Parrish on Monday and Bellinger laced a double. Entering the game in place of Williams late in tonight's game, Bellinger batted in the ninth inning and lined a two-run homer.</p>
        <p>Pettitte is 10-6 now, his earned run average down to 4.37. He was hit in the shin by a hard ground ball in the second inning but stayed in the game, and continued the recent string of success by the Yankees' starters. Denny Neagle shut down Tampa Bay on Sunday, Roger Clemens battled to beat the Orioles on Monday, and Pettitte cruised tonight. Pitching is contagious, as the pitchers are wont to say.</p>
        <p>So is winning. ''We're on a nice run right now,'' Pettitte said. ''We're really starting to come together.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>CHUCK KNOBLAUCH will fly to New York on Wednesday for tests on his right elbow. ''I've never had any arm trouble before,'' he said. ''I'm a little more concerned than I normally would be, because I've never had any arm stuff.''</p>
