        <p>This is not your grandmother's tea salon. Tealuxe, 2955 Broadway (116th Street), is a sleek black, gray and copper space that, in a city awash in coffee bars, gives tea lovers a room of their own.</p>
        <p>The first New York branch of a Boston chain, Tealuxe has 101 varieties of loose tea for sale by the gram, or ready to sip in its cafe or at the counter. Need a cup of dragon pearl jasmine or golden tippy Assam as a pick-me-up? How about some iced sweet-melon and white tea?</p>

        <p>It's nice to see small details attended to, like serving simple syrup with the iced tea. And there is a menu of grilled sandwiches, salads and sweets.</p>
        <p>Bruce Fernie and Katherine Walsh, who founded Tealuxe, said they were inspired by Mariage Freres, a chain of Parisian tea shops. They plan to open a smaller Tealuxe, which Mr. Fernie calls a teaosk, in the Citicorp atrium, and others in Rockefeller Center and the World Financial Center.</p>
