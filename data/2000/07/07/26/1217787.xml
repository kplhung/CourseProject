        <p>In his first three training camps as Giants coach, Jim Fassel spent nearly every day defending his starting quarterback.</p>
        <p>''The truth is nobody thought that the guy we had starting was going to finish the year in the job,'' Fassel said today.

        <p>In his first three training camps as Giants coach, Jim Fassel spent nearly every day defending his starting quarterback.</p>
        <p>''The truth is nobody thought that the guy we had starting was going to finish the year in the job,'' Fassel said today. ''I tried to defend the guy, whether it was Dave Brown or Danny Kanell or Kent Graham, but the questions kept coming, which I understood. It was a matter of fact that nobody thought the guy was going to last.''</p>
        <p>Whether Kerry Collins, this year's starter, will lead the Giants to the playoffs is still a worthy debate and Fassel has faced frequent questioning about Collins's development. But for the first time, Fassel has a clear-cut, acknowledged choice at the position, and more significantly, a seasoned backup, Jason Garrett, who understands his role.</p>
        <p>Or, as Fassel said today: ''The quarterback meetings are a lot easier now. You're not throwing meat out on the table.''</p>
        <p>Fassel was being facetious, but to the point. The quarterback position is so valued, it is disquieting when you have to manage the ambitions of two quarterbacks who each want the job, and yet, must coexist day after day.</p>
        <p>''It can be a situation where each guy is trying so hard to get his piece of the meal,'' Fassel said. ''We don't have that situation anymore.''</p>
        <p>The Giants believe Garrett, who spent seven seasons behind Troy Aikman, has the savvy to offer exactly the right amount of support to the starting quarterback. It is Collins's team, sink or swim. It is not a three-game tryout.</p>
        <p>It is also a comfort to the Giants that Garrett, 34, has succeeded whenever he has been called upon, because there are few National Football League teams that go through an entire season without needing their backup quarterback to play. Garrett had a 6-3 record as a starter in Dallas, completed 56.1 passes with 11 career touchdowns and only 5 interceptions. His career quarterback rating is 83.2, which is considerably higher than Collins's 66.1.</p>
        <p>But you will not hear Garrett quoting -- or whispering -- those statistics around camp.</p>
        <p>''It's very important for a player to know his role,'' Garrett said. ''The healthiest situation is when there is a clear No. 1 and a clear No. 2. That being said, I know that with Troy, he was too busy playing to see everything on the field. I could offer another pair of eyes, another perspective.</p>
        <p>''And if I get a chance, I've got to be ready to go and do it.''</p>
        <p>Collins, 27, seems relieved to have Garrett around.</p>
        <p>''This year it's like night and day,'' Collins said. ''There was never any bad blood between Kent and I, but he was trying to hold on to what he had and everybody's talking about how eventually, considering my contract, I'd get an opportunity.</p>
        <p>''I knew that and I think Kent knew that. I don't think anybody was ever comfortable.''</p>
        <p>Garrett, meanwhile, has been impressive as an accurate passer who wastes little time making decisions in the pocket.</p>
        <p>''We wanted Jason because he's made clutch plays off the bench when he's had to, and because he's like an extra coach on the team,'' Ernie Accorsi, the Giants' general manager, said.</p>
        <p>The Giants wrangled down to the wire for Garrett's services with the Cowboys' owner, Jerry Jones, calling Garrett inside the Giants' offices as his contract was being completed. Jones wanted Garrett to become a player-coach, with a lot of other possibilities discussed. Garrett concedes he would probably like to coach in the N.F.L. some day, but added: ''I'm still working on the playing part.''</p>
        <p>So far, he is doing it in an unobtrusive way. Which is exactly the way the Giants and Jim Fassel like it.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Giants' second-round pick, CORNELIUS GRIFFIN, ended his contract holdout and arrived in Albany Tuesday. Griffin, a defensive tackle, signed a four-year deal worth $2.785 million with a $1.1 million signing bonus. . . . The Giants also signed the free-agent cornerback JERMAINE JONES, a fifth-round draft pick of the Jets last year who played one game before he was released. . . . Simulating a third-and-1 situation in their first full-contact drill of training camp, RON DAYNE gained 6 yards on the first play run. In 7 of the next 11 plays, the offense successfully converted the first-down attempt. When it was first-stringers against first-stringers, the offense picked up the first down only 50 percent of the time and Dayne was stopped for no gain in his other rushing attempt with the first unit. . . . Center DUSTY ZEIGLER, who was poked in the eye Saturday, returned to practice.</p>
