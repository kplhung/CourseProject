        <p>The Compaq Computer Corporation reported second-quarter earnings yesterday that met analysts' estimates, and the company's executives forecast strong revenue growth in the second half of the year.</p>
        <p>For the quarter ended June 30, Compaq reported earnings of $387 million, or 22 cents a diluted share, compared with a loss of $184 million in the period a year earlier. Revenues grew 7 percent, to $10.13 billion from $9.42 billion in the second quarter of 1999.</p>
        <p>Excluding investment gains of $25 million after tax, Compaq earned 21 cents a diluted share, equal to the consensus estimate, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>Compaq reported its results after the close of the market. Compaq shares closed at $28.1875, up $1.5625, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Compaq's results come after quarterly reports from the IDC Corporation and Dataquest Inc. that showed that PC shipments rose less than forecast in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>IDC said PC unit shipments in the second quarter rose 14.5 percent from the period a year earlier, below its estimate of 15 percent. Dataquest said global shipments rose 18 percent, below its forecast for 18.5 percent growth. IDC said United States  shipments rose 7.2 percent, while Dataquest reported 11.5 percent. Analysts said the slower-than-expected growth was a result of slowing consumer sales and shortages of microprocessors.</p>
        <p>''The whole PC sector took a hit from the IDC and Dataquest numbers coming out, but those were essentially retrospective,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J. P. Morgan.</p>
        <p>After stumbling badly two years ago, Compaq has continued to lose market share, primarily to the Dell Computer Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company. Although Compaq remains the leader worldwide, it now has 13.2 percent of the global market, down from 14.3 percent in the quarter a year earlier, according to IDC.</p>
        <p>Compaq said enterprise computing revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 9 percent year over year. Compaq's commercial PC group reported revenue of $3.3 billion, an increase of just 3 percent year over year, but returned to profitability in the second quarter. Compaq's consumer group posted revenue of $1.6 billion, an increase of 32 percent over the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The quarter brought the end of Michael Capellas's first year as Compaq's president and chief executive. Mr. Capellas has worked to turn Compaq around by streamlining manufacturing processes and rationalizing its product lines. But the company's revenue growth still pales in comparison to market leaders like Dell in PC's or Sun Microsystems Inc. in servers.</p>
        <p>''We expect to deliver strong, double-digit revenue growth in the second half of the year,'' Mr. Capellas  said in a statement. ''I feel the renewed energy and enthusiasm in our people and their determination to succeed. I am very confident in our ability to meet our third-quarter and full-year objectives,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read, said he thought Compaq would be challenged to meet these goals. ''While the quarter was on target, they've got to deliver substantial revenue and earnings gains to meet guidance because Capellas is out there with these very aggressive promises,'' he said.</p>
