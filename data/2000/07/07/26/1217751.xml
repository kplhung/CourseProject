        <p>The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, is planning to visit Russia in September, Russian officials said today, in a further step by the once-secretive North Korean state to overcome its isolation.</p>
        <p>The visit is planned for Vladivostok, a port city in Russia's Far East. Arrangements for the visit were confirmed today by aides to Yevgeny Nazdratenko, the governor of Russia's Primorsky region, which borders North Korea.</p>
        <p>The trip is being billed as an ''unofficial'' visit to the region, not a negotiating session with Kremlin leaders. But the agenda includes trade, economic cooperation and other measures to expand ties between Russia and North Korea.</p>
        <p>Long one of the most insular of nations, North Korea has begun to break down the barriers that have separated it from the world. Last month, Mr. Kim was host of a summit meeting in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, with his South Korean counterpart. North Korea has also established diplomatic relations in recent months with Italy, the Philippines and Australia.</p>
        <p>The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, recently visited Pyongyang. After meeting with Mr. Kim, he reported that North Korea had offered to abandon its missile program if other nations would help it launch satellites into space.</p>
        <p>While there was considerable ambiguity at first about the North Korean proposal, Russian officials later said North Korea was not asking Western nations to provide it with rocket boosters and would be content with an arrangement in which two or three of its satellites were launched each year in other countries.</p>
        <p>''It is not a matter of launching from North Korean territory, but from the territory of other countries,'' Russia's foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, said at the recent  meeting of eight industrial nations in Okinawa.</p>
        <p>The Russians have highlighted the North Korean offer in order to challenge the prime rationale for the American missile defense plan and to debunk the idea that North Korea is a dangerous ''rogue state.'' Clinton administration officials acknowledge that the North Korean offer is potentially very significant, though it needs to be explored further in talks between the two sides.</p>
        <p>Little is known about Mr. Kim's travels. It is a matter of public record that he has visited China. He has also said he has gone to Indonesia and other countries, sometimes incognito.</p>
        <p>The invitation to visit Vladivostok was made by Mr. Nazdratenko, who accompanied Mr. Putin on his recent trip to Pyongyang, Natalya V. Vstovskaya, a spokeswoman for Mr. Nazdratenko, said in a telephone interview today. She said that Mr. Kim had accepted the invitation and that the trip was scheduled for the first few days of September. The North Korean consulate in the Primorsky region declined to comment on the visit.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vstovskaya said Mr. Nazdratenko had proposed several agricultural projects to Mr. Kim during the Russians' visit to Pyongyang and hoped to encourage new business, including the use of Russian railroads for trade with North Korea. ''We want our railroads and ports to work at full capacity so that North Korea's cargo is not going via China but through our territory,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Russian government has already granted permission for 5,000 North Koreans to work in the timber and construction industries in Primorsky, though the number of workers now is far less.</p>
        <p>According to Russian news reports, Mr. Nazdratenko, an autocratic governor who has ridden roughshod over the region's press and political establishment, established a rapport with the North Korean leader. The 52-year-old Mr. Nazdratenko and the 58-year-old Mr. Kim have the same birthday -- Feb. 16. Mr. Nazdratenko, who rarely drinks, later said he had been forced to drink several toasts to placate Mr. Kim.</p>
        <p>''I had to drink for the sake of peace at the border,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nazdratenko later called for expanded ties with North Korea.</p>
        <p>''As a result of brainless politics, we literally abandoned this country, and we not only froze relations with it for 10 years, but nearly created an enemy on our borders,'' the Russian newspaper Konkurent quoted Mr. Nazdratenko as saying. ''I am glad that there has been a breakthrough in relations with North Korea and that Putin did it.''</p>
