        <p>Day after day, for more than two months in early 1998, Penny Heyns, the South African Olympic champion swimmer, arrived at the pool to begin her training. Yet, day after day, the only thing that kept rising to the surface was her discontent.</p>
        <p>''I had no desire anymore,'' recalled Heyns, 25, who trained at the University of Nebraska, where she was pursuing undergraduate studies. ''I was miserable. I had no peace. I would sit there and just leave. Now and then, I'd get in the water, but it would be for maybe 2,000 meters,'' only a third of her previous training standard.</p>

        <p>Day after day, for more than two months in early 1998, Penny Heyns, the South African Olympic champion swimmer, arrived at the pool to begin her training. Yet, day after day, the only thing that kept rising to the surface was her discontent.</p>
        <p>''I had no desire anymore,'' recalled Heyns, 25, who trained at the University of Nebraska, where she was pursuing undergraduate studies. ''I was miserable. I had no peace. I would sit there and just leave. Now and then, I'd get in the water, but it would be for maybe 2,000 meters,'' only a third of her previous training standard.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't lifting weights,'' she said. ''People were telling me to quit, that I had already accomplished enough.''</p>
        <p>They had a strong case. During the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, Heyns had won the first two gold medals for South Africa since 1952. South Africa had been banned from Olympic competition from 1964 until 1992 because of the country's racial policies of apartheid.</p>
        <p>Then, on the last day of the 1996 Games, Josia Thugwane, a black South African, won the men's marathon. Although Thugwane's triumph, dedicated to ''my country and to President Mandela,'' put an emotional exclamation point on South Africa's Olympics in Atlanta, Heyns's two victories were more impressive. She established Olympic records -- in the 100-meter (1 minute 7:73 seconds) and 200-meter (2:25:41) breaststroke.</p>
        <p>There was nothing left for Heyns to accomplish. Nonetheless, the notion of retiring from the sport that she had long adored made her feel as unsettled as the prospect of all-out preparation. So, she left Nebraska in April 1998 and moved to Calgary, Alberta, reuniting with her longtime coach, Jan Bidrman, who had moved on to the University of Calgary. In the process, Heyns somehow found a way to summon the energy and motivation to take on the challenge one more time. She has no regrets.</p>
        <p>''I started to enjoy it again,'' said Heyns, who will compete in the same two events in Sydney, as well as the 4x100 medley relay.</p>
        <p>Part of what inspires Heyns to duplicate what she achieved in Atlanta is the belief that, if she is fortunate enough to stand on the podium again, she will appreciate it more than she did the last time. After her victory in the 100 in Atlanta, instead of excitement, she felt empathy for a fellow competitor, Samantha Riley of Australia, who took the bronze.</p>
        <p>''She had been a bit of a hero,'' Heyns said. ''I knew how disappointed she must have been. The swim was way below her potential.''</p>
        <p>Even after Heyns followed two days later with a triumph in the 200, becoming the first woman to capture both events in the same Olympics, she was not able to fully absorb the moment.</p>
        <p>''I had seen people crying and waving and being overjoyed,'' said Heyns of some other athletes' response to winning medals. ''But I felt if I were to do that, it would be acting. I didn't know what to do. Being South African, I didn't grow up with the Olympic dream like most people. Only when I went back to South Africa did I realize what a big deal it was.''</p>
        <p>It is certainly a bigger deal this time, especially since Heyns gives every indication that her days of competition will most likely end in Australia. Spirited and spiritual -- she credits God frequently for guiding her to make the proper decisions -- Heyns does not seem to be an athlete who will linger on the stage too long, tarnishing images of her past glory.</p>
        <p>''I'm very grateful and humbled by my achievements,'' said Heyns, who also competed in the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona, Spain. ''I think it's a gift. But, at the same time, there are more important things in life. There are more than external things.''</p>
        <p>For the next two months, however, her focus will remain on Sydney. Even so, it will not be easy to repeat. After a remarkable 1999 -- in a two-month stretch, she set 10 world records in the breaststroke -- Heyns has staggered a bit this season. At Janet Evans Invitational in Los Angeles two weeks ago, a meet she dominated in 1999, Heyns finished second in the 200-meter finals with an unimpressive 2:29:89, more than six seconds slower than the world mark she established last year. She and Bidrman chose to emphasize the positive, that Heyns had actually improved a few seconds from an even poorer performance a week earlier in Vancouver, British Columbia. Nonetheless, still feeling the effects of some rigorous training and a recent excursion to South Africa, Heyns is concerned.</p>
        <p>''I don't have any answers right now,'' said Heyns, who skipped the 100-meter final in Los Angeles to do more training. ''I have tired legs. It takes more out of me than it did in the past.''</p>
        <p>The year held so much more promise in the winter when Heyns posted her best training times. World records in spring competitions seemed attainable. That changed in March, however, when a member of the University of Calgary's swim team was seriously injured in a car accident. While the rest of the team was at a meet, Heyns stayed behind to help comfort the swimmer's family. She was at the hospital every day, and was in the room when her friend died.</p>
        <p>Heyns refused to use the death as an excuse, and said, ''I had never dealt with death before.'' Added Mike Blondal, the team's head coach, ''It took a lot of emotional and physical energy for her to be around the family.''</p>
        <p>Yet, it would be premature to dismiss Heyns's prospects in Sydney. She still holds the world records in the 100 and 200, and said Bidrman ''always performs when it matters.''</p>
        <p>''I know she'll swim fast,'' Bidrman said. ''Whether it will be fast enough to win, I don't know.'' Referring to Heyns's current fatigue, he added: ''Maybe it is the best thing.  Nobody will expect anything from her.''</p>
        <p>Blondal added: ''She has an incredible faith in herself. She'll be ready.''</p>
        <p>Until then, except for a meet in Winnipeg, Manitoba, next month, she will spend most of her time training. She will not have any trouble finding the motivation to do laps and lift weights. Sydney, after all, is less than two months away, and any signs of discontent are long gone.</p>
