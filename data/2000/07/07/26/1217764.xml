        <p>American law enforcement officials have agreed to set up a regional academy in Botswana to help train police officers and prosecutors from crime-ridden South Africa and many neighboring nations.</p>
        <p>The school, which will be 160 miles north of here, just outside the Botswana capital, Gaborone, will be the third such academy set up by the State Department in its effort to bolster the fight against burgeoning global crime syndicates.</p>
        <p>Under the direction of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, the academy, like ones in Hungary and Thailand, will bring experts from the F.B.I. and other federal and international agencies to countries where the criminal justice system lags far behind the cunning and creativity of criminals.</p>
        <p>Since South Africa opened its borders several years ago as the apartheid era was coming to a close, it has become a hub of criminal activity, from counterfeiting and money laundering to drug trafficking and alien smuggling. Lured by the high life here in the country's richest city, criminals have come from across the continent, overwhelming a poorly trained police force that has been hard pressed to control its own thieves and murderers.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Botswana is one of the safest countries in Africa. Unlike Budapest or Bangkok, where the other two academies are, its capital is not a hub of crime in its region and it has seen only hints of the complicated criminal enterprises that are thriving in Johannesburg. It is a country of about 1.5 million people, with a police force of about 6,500 officers, compared with South Africa, which has 44 million people and more than 100,000 police officers.</p>
        <p>In fact, South Africa was the original choice for the academy, but leaders there suggested that the United States consider neighboring countries, according to a State Department report. As the most advanced country in the region, South Africa is often the location of choice for offices of international organizations. It is a privilege that its neighbors have come to envy, even resent, and in bowing out of this opportunity, South Africa was ceding it to them.</p>
        <p>''Everything that comes to the region comes to South Africa, and in that sense it's prudent not to follow that pattern,'' an American official involved in the selection process said. ''We had a very willing partner in Botswana, and they committed the funds.'' Commissioner Norman Moleboge, the head of the Botswana police force, said that while South Africa's crime problems were enormous compared with Botswana's, they had to be treated as a regional concern that, if left unchecked, would eventually undermine even the most stable of southern Africa's countries.</p>
        <p>''My neighbor's problems are as good as mine,'' Commissioner Moleboge said in a telephone interview from Gaborone. ''If major crimes find their way into neighboring countries, they will find their way into Botswana, so we need to fight crime from a national, regional and international point of view.''</p>
        <p>American and Botswana officials signed an agreement on Monday in Gaborone to establish the academy, and training programs are expected to begin in the next few months. Courses will cover subjects from forensics and narcotics to organized crime and public corruption. Eventually, the academy is to be housed in Botswana's national police college, which is expected to be completed in about a year.</p>
