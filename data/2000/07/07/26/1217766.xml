        <p>A second biotechnology giant, the Genzyme Corporation, has filed a patent infringement suit against Transkaryotic Therapies Inc., the upstart company locked in a closely watched patent battle with Amgen Inc.</p>
        <p>Genzyme said yesterday that it had filed suit in United States District Court in Wilmington, Del., accusing Transkaryotic, which is usually called TKT, of infringing a patent covering the production of an enzyme to treat Fabry disease, a rare inherited disorder.</p>
        <p>Transkaryotic and Genzyme, both based in Cambridge, Mass., are in a race to be first to market with the enzyme, known as alpha-galactosidase. TKT applied for marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration on June 16 and Genzyme followed a week later. If not blocked by the patent lawsuit, TKT's drug, which it calls Replagal, is expected to be the company's first product.</p>
        <p>TKT has developed a technique for making biotechnology drugs that it says avoids the patents held by industry giants. Instead of splicing the human gene for a protein into bacteria or hamster cells, which is the conventional approach, TKT turns on the inactive gene in human cells. In a trial already under way in Boston, Amgen is trying to stop TKT from using this technique to produce a version of Amgen's huge-selling anemia drug, erythropoietin.</p>
        <p>Yet it is not clear that TKT is using the controversial technique to produce its drug for Fabry disease. The company has never said how it is making Replagal and might be using more conventional recombinant DNA. But Genzyme said its patent covers both methods.</p>
        <p>TKT said it did not infringe and it considered the Genzyme patent invalid. ''It is a shame that Genzyme has chosen to compete based on a frivolous lawsuit rather than on the merits of their products,'' Dr. Richard F. Selden, TKT's chief executive, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>People with Fabry disease have a deficiency of the alpha-galactosidase enzyme and therefore cannot break down certain fats, which then accumulate in the lining of the blood vessels in the kidney, heart and other organs. The condition can cause pain, numbness, kidney failure and heart disease. Death typically occurs about age 40.</p>
        <p>Genzyme estimates that only 2,000 to 4,000 people suffer from the disease worldwide. But even such a small number of patients can mean high revenue if there is no competition and the drug price is high. Genzyme's leading product, a drug called Cerezyme, which treats another rare inherited disorder called Gaucher disease, has annual sales of about $500 million. Even though only 3,000 patients are taking the drug, each one is paying about $170,000 a year.</p>
        <p>The filing of the lawsuit was announced after the markets closed. Shares of TKT fell $1.75, to $30.375. Shares of Genzyme General, the division of Genzyme that is developing the Fabry drug, fell 85.9375 cents, to $68.3125.</p>
