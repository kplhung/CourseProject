        <p>After blanketing Central Park, Staten Island and parts of Queens with pesticide in a stepped-up campaign to knock out the West Nile virus, city officials were preparing to spray Roosevelt Island and a large section of Manhattan tonight.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a day after they announced that the virus had been detected in mosquitoes in the city for the first time this year, officials said  they were still planning to attack mosquitoes primarily from the ground, spraying the pesticide Anvil from trucks.</p>
        <p>Widespread aerial pesticide spraying was used last year when an outbreak of West Nile, a mosquito-borne disease, killed 7 people in the New York area and sickened 55 others. City officials said yesterday they had received permission from the state to use helicopters to drop a bacterial larvicide that kills mosquito eggs in the wetlands of Staten Island, but they said they planned to rely on  ground spraying in residential areas.</p>
        <p>On Monday, city health officials announced that they had found mosquitoes infected with the virus in three sample pools, one in Central Park and two on Staten Island, that were tested as part of a surveillance program.</p>
        <p>State health officials yesterday reported finding West Nile in two more samples of mosquitoes, both in Rockland County, bringing to eight the total number of mosquito pools in New York that have tested positive for the virus. In New Jersey, no mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus, and in Connecticut one pool has tested positive.</p>
        <p>Officials have placed 120 mosquito traps at more than 70 spots around the city, and the state provides weekly reports of the test results.</p>
        <p>Parts of Staten Island, where last week two dead crows tested positive for the virus, had already been treated, but after the virus was found in two mosquito pools there, the rest of the borough was sprayed Monday night and yesterday morning, officials said. Neighborhoods in Queens, and a small section of Brooklyn, were to be sprayed last night.</p>
        <p>And in Manhattan, areas from 23rd Street to 110th Street, between the East River and the Hudson, and on Roosevelt Island were scheduled to be sprayed from midnight tonight to 5 a.m. tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The discovery of West Nile virus in Central Park, in a pool of 54 mosquitoes trapped near 63rd Street and Fifth Avenue, prompted the city to close all 843 acres for overnight spraying Monday and to postpone a New York Philharmonic concert until last night.</p>
        <p>The Central Park spraying began at 10 p.m. Monday and ended at 5 a.m. yesterday.</p>
        <p>Two and a half hours after it ended, the park was bustling with joggers, cyclists and in-line skaters, many of whom said they were not concerned or did not know about the pesticide spraying. But it was another story with the dog owners.</p>
        <p>The usually crowded dog run near West 72nd Street had only a few of the regulars yesterday, and those who took their dogs out for a walk were trying to avoid the grass, fearing their pets would ingest the pesticide.</p>
        <p>''It's uncanny that there's nobody here,'' said Dana Weiss, 48, who was walking her golden retriever, Buddy, and said she was surprised to see so few dogs around. ''This is very odd.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Weiss said she normally walked her dog for 45 minutes, but she had limited it to 10 minutes and kept him on a leash, even though dogs are allowed off a leash until 9 a.m.</p>
        <p>Francis Ginsberg, 45, walked into the park with her two dogs about 8:30 and discovered that she had little company.</p>
        <p>''Where is everybody?'' she said, pulling a newspaper out of her bag and glancing at the headlines. When she saw that the park had been closed the previous night for pesticide spraying, she looked down at the dogs, Angelo, a bichon frise, and Valentina, a Maltese, and said, ''I have to go to Riverside,'' and left the park.</p>
