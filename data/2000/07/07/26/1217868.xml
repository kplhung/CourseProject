        <p>It was shortly after midnight, sitting across from Yasir Arafat in the small presidential cabin at Camp David, that President Clinton realized that the foreign policy achievement he desired more than any other during the waning months of his tenure had slipped his grasp.</p>
        <p>On the table in the rustic cabin was an American proposal on the future of Jerusalem, a proposal that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel was edging toward accepting.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Arafat had repeatedly refused to give ground, and early today Mr. Clinton, mustering all his legendary powers of persuasion, launched into a final pitch. If you take the deal, he told the aging Palestinian leader, you will have achieved legitimacy and international recognition, as well as aid and investment from the West. If you walk away, he added, according to a senior administration official deeply involved in the talks, ''you will lose a Palestinian state of substantial size,'' and risk a slow slide into chaos.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, whom Americans describe as ''a deeply conflicted man,'' decided to walk. He stood up, left the cabin, and at 3 a.m., through an aide, rejected Mr. Clinton's deal. He also refused to go along with Mr. Clinton's Plan B: announcing a settlement on all issues except the status of Jerusalem, which would be kicked down the road, with both sides agreeing to resolve it eventually, and peacefully.</p>
        <p>A few hours later, at a White House news  conference, a deeply frustrated Mr. Clinton compared the days of painstaking talks that ended in failure to ''going to the dentist without having your gums deadened.''</p>
        <p>This was hardly Mr. Clinton's first trip to the dentist's chair.</p>
        <p>Twice in the last seven months he has invested enormous amounts of time and prestige in an attempt to reach historic accords between Israel and its neighbors, first the Syrians, then the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>In both cases, Mr. Clinton's foreign policy team was betting that changing times plus the force of Mr. Clinton's own finely honed sense for the middle ground might be enough to win agreement, and with it a legacy to cap his second term.</p>
        <p>Yet twice so far Mr. Clinton and his aides have been proved wrong.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is hardly to be blamed for the failure of the talks that ended early this morning. He entered the process with little to lose, save for his dwindling hoard of time.</p>
        <p>And while his second term may be viewed as a series of lost opportunities -- two years squandered on scandal, two locked in stalemate with Congress -- few presidents have devoted his kind of time to peacemaking, from Northern Ireland to the Korean Peninsula to the Middle East.</p>
        <p>''He'll get credit for his huge effort,'' said James MacGregor Burns, a presidential historian at the University of Maryland. ''He has not only talked peace but has devoted hundreds and hundreds of hours to it. Even the collapse of this negotiation will not hurt his standing on this score.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, not surprisingly, argued today that Camp David was worth the shot -- and may yet prove productive.</p>
        <p>''I think, on balance, it was very much the right thing to do, and it increases the chance of a successful agreement, and it increases the chances of avoiding a disaster,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>During the talks, one American official said, even a Palestinian negotiator noted that during the two weeks of the summit meeting ''all the taboos have been broken,'' as both sides discussed compromises on Jerusalem and other areas that had never been broached outside of policy institutes that study such issues.</p>
        <p>Yet even as he held out the hope that new talks could resume in late summer or in the autumn, Mr. Clinton clearly sees his season drawing to a close.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago he entered the talks privately exuding cautious optimism. One of his closest aides said at the time that while no deal was certain, the stars were uniquely aligned. Mr. Barak, the White House had concluded, needed an agreement if he had any hope of remaining in office after the recent collapse of his governing coalition. Mr. Arafat, it was felt, knew that his own days as the leader of the Palestinians were dwindling and that an agreement was his only hope for a different life for young Palestinians.</p>
        <p>And America's prosperity and budget surpluses, Clinton aides concluded, meant that the president was likely to succeed in persuading Congress to pay the huge bill necessary to support a Middle East peace, opening the floodgates for aid from other countries.</p>
        <p>''It may not be all gone,'' one Clinton aide said today. The president's last, best hope is that Mr. Barak survives the breakup of his coalition to negotiate another day, and that Mr. Arafat concludes that declaring a Palestinian state on Sept. 13 is ''the path to conflict when a compromise is within reach.''</p>
        <p>But that is betting on the last pitch of the last inning, and it may be little solace to Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>In some ways he had been preparing for the Monday night meeting for seven years, since the Oslo accords and then the agreement reached at Wye Plantation, all dress rehearsals for the big show that never came off at Camp David.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks he had worked late into the night, coming up with ''bridging proposals,'' which were the basis for the final proposal Mr. Arafat rejected.</p>
        <p>''Give me a test on some piece of land anywhere in Jerusalem or Israel, I know the answer,'' Mr. Clinton had said on the eve of the talks, discussing his late-night preparations. ''Ask me to draw a map of the West Bank in my sleep, I can do it.''</p>
        <p>His frustration seemed particularly high today because in the hours after he returned from Japan on Sunday afternoon it seemed as if real progress was being made.</p>
        <p>Within hours of his return, he called a meeting on security issues and ''there was real progress,'' a senior American official said. Then there were sessions on borders and refugees, and ''for the first time, we could see the outline of an agreement,'' the official said. ''But neither side wanted to make final decisions until they tackled Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Clinton turned to that subject, he put together what one official called ''a mosaic of ideas, our ideas and others' ideas, that we felt could be the basis of a final settlement.'' That was the proposal put to Mr. Arafat, with Mr. Clinton making the case that a generation of Palestinians ''are on the verge of living a different life than you lived.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, though, could not break free of several generations of Palestinian ideology about the sanctity of sovereignty over Jerusalem. Nor would he allow the issue of Jerusalem to be deferred. His refusal to do so ''surprised'' Mr. Clinton in the words of one aide, and ''frustrated him'' in the words of another.</p>
        <p>''He wanted it badly for the right reasons,'' an administration official said of Mr. Clinton. ''He's invested seven years in this.''</p>
