        <p>One of the first items Bill Belichick crossed off his to-do list after taking over as head coach of the New England Patriots was calling his team fat.</p>
        <p>''What he meant was phat,'' said one player, joking.</p>
        <p>No, that is slang for something positive. Belichick meant f-a-t. A coach as experienced as Belichick knows there are three things that get under a professional player's skin: cutting his salary, questioning his heart or calling him waistline-challenged.</p>
        <p>So to grab his team's attention, Belichick went with Door No. 3. It was a phat -- er, wise -- move.</p>
        <p>After three sleepy years under the laid-back Pete Carroll, whose regime was more like summer camp than a football environment, Belichick was an instant eye-opener.</p>
        <p>His harsh words were followed by swift action. Belichick recently cut the backup tackle Ed Ellis for failing his physical and banned four out-of-shape players, including quarterback John Friesz, from practice for a day.</p>
        <p>If there is one thing Belichick's defensive squads have always been -- besides prepared for any possible scenario on the field -- is in tremendous shape. The Patriots were not meeting his standards, so the team began exhausting conditioning drills. And just in case players still did not get the message, they picked up the newspaper the next day and read these blistering words from their new leader:</p>
        <p>''We've got too many people who are overweight, too many guys who are out of shape, and too many guys who just haven't paid the price they need to pay at this time of the season. You can't win with 40 good players while the other team has 53.''</p>
        <p>This week, Belichick explained the message he was sending his team.</p>
        <p>''I've been with some very successful franchises,'' he said. ''The Giants, the Jets, and with those teams we had some very successful systems. And not just X's and O's, with everything, including conditioning. So I am trying to do here what we did with those franchises. I'm telling the players, 'This works. It's proven. So let's follow it.' ''</p>
        <p>Or, do not follow at your own risk.</p>
        <p>Belichick is not the only new National Football League head coach trying to grab a fast foothold inside his players' heads. In Miami, Dave Wannstedt loaded his team on a bus and took them to see the Imax film ''Michael Jordan: To the Max'' as a way to build camaraderie, something that was missing under Jimmy Johnson. In Green Bay, players were often late for meetings when Ray Rhodes was head coach, so Mike Sherman has installed digital clocks throughout the complex and beefed up the system for imposing fines.</p>
        <p>In one of Al Groh's first days as Jets head coach, he had a spiffy video presentation that first showed an image of Bill Parcells and commented that the legend is not coaching anymore. Then Groh flashed the image of Belichick and said that the genius was gone. A picture of wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson followed and Groh explained that the star was in Tampa Bay. He concluded by saying despite the brain and talent drain, the Jets were still a good team, and there should be no excuses.</p>
        <p>Belichick's actions are in the same vein as those other coaches. The difference with Belichick is that he is a work in progress.</p>
        <p>In some ways, he is still the same coach he has always been: always intellectual, always a brilliant tactical mind. Tough, disciplined, up at five in the morning planning the day.</p>
        <p>''You can tell he is a hard worker,'' defensive back Lawyer Milloy said. ''And we needed a chewing out. I respect a coach who can walk up to you and say, 'You're not cutting it.' ''</p>
        <p>In other ways, Belichick is evolving. After landing the job with New England, Belichick immediately realized he could not be the same person who coached the Cleveland Browns from 1991 to 1995, when his record was 37-45. Then, some players and front-office executives viewed him as impersonal and gruff.</p>
        <p>Now, Belichick smiles more. He makes jokes. The front office feels at ease with him. And he has added perspective to his personality. In fact, Belichick did something head coaches rarely do: he admitted to making a mistake. Belichick said that sometimes he and other coaches from the two Super Bowl Giants teams went too far in disciplining their players.</p>
        <p>''I think I've mellowed since then, yes,'' Belichick said. ''Age does that. When I look back at some of the things we did as coaches on those Giants teams, we went too far in some instances. There were times when during meetings we would take canisters of film and throw them across the room, to make sure the players knew we were upset. That was unnecessary.''</p>
        <p>Belichick added: ''We would punish a player by making him run laps all day. ''Sometimes guys would run so long, by the time they were done, practice was almost over. There were times we had them run 25 or 30 sprints. If a player jumped offside during practice, we would make him run three long laps. We could have probably gotten the message across with one. I think getting older has really helped me understand balance.''</p>
        <p>Belichick, by many accounts, has matured, maybe even since those bizarre days in early January when he abruptly resigned as coach of the Jets after only 48 hours. Eventually, a settlement was reached between the Jets and the Patriots, with the Jets receiving a No. 1 pick to allow Belichick out of his contract.</p>
        <p>During a wide-ranging conversation at the Patriots' training camp, the only place it was difficult to pin down Belichick was on his relationship with Parcells, which spans almost two decades and seems to be as complex as one of Belichick's defenses. One thing is clear -- their relationship was strictly professional with little personal interaction. In fact, people close to both men maintain a small rivalry developed.</p>
        <p>An example of that happened this past season. During some national broadcasts of Jets games, a chart of Parcells's record with Belichick as an assistant (117-73-1) and without Belichick (21-27) was often flashed on the screen. A television executive said Parcells complained about the statistic, calling it inaccurate. Parcells declined to comment for this article.</p>
        <p>When asked to describe their relationship, Belichick said: ''Bill and I worked together a long time. We had a lot of success. We didn't need to talk a lot or have a lot of meetings about things. I knew what he wanted, and he allowed me to do what I wanted. With the Jets, he worked a lot with the offense, and gave me a lot of latitude.''</p>
        <p>New England does have the potential to do well in the rugged American Football Conference East. The Pro Bowl quarterback Drew Bledsoe is in his prime and the defense is solid. The team's biggest problem -- one that has plagued the franchise since Curtis Martin made a fast break for New York three years ago -- is that they have no proven running back. And in recent days, the Patriots have been crippled by a number of injuries, forcing the team to cancel a scrimmage this week against the Giants.</p>
        <p>Still, no one should bet against Belichick, who has had success at almost every coaching stop. Can his Patriots make the playoffs this coming season?</p>
        <p>Phat chance.</p>
