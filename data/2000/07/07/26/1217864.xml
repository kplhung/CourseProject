      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush formally introduced his running mate, Dick Cheney, to a cheering crowd here today, praising the former defense secretary and longtime family friend as a man of  ''great integrity, sound judgment and experience.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Cheney stood almost bashfully at the side of the ebullient Texas governor, Mr. Bush tacitly acknowledged the oddity of his months-long search for a vice-presidential nominee ending with the selection of the searcher himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney had been tapped by Mr. Bush to supervise that process in late April. But over the ensuing weeks and months, Mr. Bush said, ''I benefited from his keen insight. I was impressed by the thoughtful and thorough way he approached his mission. And gradually I realized that the person who was best qualified to be my vice-presidential nominee was working by my side.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Cheney took Mr. Bush's place at a lectern set up in front of a row of 30 American flags, his remarks -- only half as long as the governor's -- suggested that Mr. Bush had found a No. 2 with precisely the kind of loyalty that the governor had always said he wanted.</p>
        <p>''I enthusiastically accept the challenge,'' he told Mr. Bush, ''for this reason: I believe you have the vision and the courage to be a great president. And I want to do absolutely everything I can to make certain that happens.''</p>
        <p>Though it had been clear for days that Mr. Cheney would almost certainly be the governor's choice, their joint appearance in a large meeting room here today marked the first formal acknowledgement by the Bush campaign that Bush-Cheney was the ticket with which the Republican Party would try to win the White House. The two men's wives, Laura Bush and Lynne Cheney, shared a modest stage with them.</p>
        <p>In turning to Mr. Cheney, Mr. Bush chose someone whose extremely conservative record from 1979 to 1989, when he represented Wyoming in Congress and reliably cast votes against abortion rights and gun control, was sure to provide Democrats and liberal interest groups with fodder for their assertions that a Bush presidency would tilt sharply toward the right.</p>
        <p>''He is probably as far right as anybody in the Republican Party today,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic minority leader.</p>
        <p>The selection also raised questions about how Mr. Cheney, who was entrusted with the task of screening other potential vice-presidential nominees, was put through the process himself. Karen P. Hughes, the director of communications for the Bush campaign, said today that Mr. Bush had taken on at least part of that chore, subjecting Mr. Cheney to the sort of questions about finances and other personal information that Mr. Cheney had asked other contenders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush appeared to accomplish several goals at once by picking Mr. Cheney. He supplemented his own limited career in government, confined to the five and a half years that he has presided over the nation's second-largest state, with the accumulated wisdom of a man who served as chief of staff under President Gerald R. Ford and then spent a decade in the House before his appointment as the defense secretary by President George Bush, the governor's father.</p>
        <p>And because the selection of Mr. Cheney did not on its face represent an overtly political calculation, it enabled Mr. Bush to maintain his assertion that he is someone more interested in good government than political gamesmanship, someone more deeply wedded to principles than to polls. There was no discernible electoral strategy at work: Mr. Cheney maintains homes in Texas and Wyoming, two states that Mr. Bush should easily win in November.</p>
        <p>Some of the remarks that Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney made today amounted to a preview of that pitch.</p>
        <p>''Governor Bush is seeking not only to win an election, but also to lead our nation,'' Mr. Cheney said in a voice that was softer, deeper and steadier than Mr. Bush's.</p>
        <p>Minutes earlier, Mr. Bush had said, ''I have to admit something. I didn't pick Dick Cheney because of Wyoming's three electoral votes, although we're going to work hard to earn them. I picked him because he is without a doubt fully capable of being the president of the United States. And I picked him because he will be a valuable partner in a Bush administration.''</p>
        <p>The word ''partner'' suggested something else Mr. Bush had been looking for: someone with whom he felt a strong sense of comfort and an equally strong sense of trust. Mr. Cheney clearly fit that bill, partly because of his history with Mr. Bush's father, partly because he helped the governor assemble a team of foreign policy advisers last year, then got to know Mr. Bush even better in the last three months.</p>
        <p>''He's obviously family-tested -- loyal all the way back,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a historian who teaches courses on the presidency at the University of Texas and has closely followed Mr. Bush's career. ''He's comfortable. They've developed a relationship as a consequence of this search process.''</p>
        <p>Professor Buchanan suggested that Mr. Cheney could also help fill any deficit of substance that voters might perceive in Mr. Bush. ''It's in keeping with the great pains that he has taken all along to build a shadow government that's made up of people who quiet the fears that he's shallow and out of his depth,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many prominent Republicans sold the selection a different way: as evidence that Mr. Bush, 54, was so secure in his own abilities and confident in his own leadership that he would recruit a teammate like Mr. Cheney, 59, who looks at least 10 years older than the governor and has a much longer political resume. Alternately, Republicans said Mr. Cheney's selection was proof that Mr. Bush was earnestly filling in the gaps in his own experience.</p>
        <p>''He's sending a powerful signal that he's continuing his preparations to become the president,'' Gov. John Engler of Michigan said today in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>Mr. Engler and other Republican leaders expressed enthusiasm about the choice, saying Mr. Cheney had a reputation on both sides of the political aisle as a thoughtful, reasonable, intelligent politician.</p>
        <p>Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said that when Mr. Cheney worked on Capitol Hill, ''he was not the kind of guy who was threatening or in your face or, you know, partisan to the extent that others didn't feel like they could work with him.''</p>
        <p>''Dick Cheney is just one of those people, if you're around him any length of time, you just feel very comfortable with him,'' Mr. Lott also said. ''You grow to have a healthy respect for him.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Lott added, he told Mr. Cheney several months ago that he would be the best choice for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Senator John McCain of Arizona, whom many House Republicans had promoted for a place on the Bush ticket, said today that Mr. Cheney's ''leadership skills are proven in many areas.''</p>
        <p>''He has an incredibly impressive resume,'' Mr. McCain said.</p>
        <p>At least a few other Republicans were left scratching their heads. They questioned why Mr. Bush, who has voted to expand the party's appeal and bring a fresh perspective to Washington, would pick a running mate with such conservative bearings and such strong ties to the Republican establishment of the past.</p>
        <p>And they questioned why Mr. Bush, long eager to emerge from his father's shadow, would summon it anew with the choice of someone from his father's cabinet.</p>
        <p>''It looks to a lot of observers -- and there's a lot of buzz about this -- like this reflects his father's influence,'' one Republican strategist said. ''And the campaign has spent two years saying that his father doesn't have a big influence.''</p>
        <p>Another Republican strategist said: ''For all the running away he's done from his father, now he's Velcroed himself to the old man. It's the old Bush. It's just unfortunate. The Democrats are gloating.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes said today that the only active role former President Bush had played in the process, other than as a sounding board for his son, was to call Dr. Denton Cooley, a prominent cardiac surgeon who is a family friend, and ask him for his opinion on Mr. Cheney's health. Mr. Cheney suffered three mild heart attacks more than a decade ago and had bypass surgery in 1988.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's advisers moved quickly today to dispel any doubts about Mr. Cheney's physical fitness for the long road to November, and possibly beyond. The Bush campaign released letters from Mr. Cheney's doctors at George Washington University that provided a detailed synopsis of his medical history.</p>
        <p>At a news conference after Mr. Bush's introduction of Mr. Cheney, Ms. Hughes was even able to answer a question about the specific food allergy mentioned in one of these reports. The allergy was to pomegranates, she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes also made a point of mentioning that when Mr. Bush, at home in the governor's mansion this morning, called Mr. Cheney's house in Dallas to offer him a place on the Republican ticket, Mr. Cheney was exercising on his treadmill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney did not take questions from reporters, instead sticking to the statements they had prepared. But Mr. Cheney appeared on CNN's ''Larry King Live'' tonight to give his first interview as Mr. Bush's running mate.</p>
        <p>He said the role he would play in a new, second Bush administration would be that of a frank but discreet adviser. ''He very much values people who level with him, who tell him exactly what they think,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''I'm most effective when I'm able to speak my piece, but also when I do it privately.''</p>
        <p>He said he had found a real chemistry with Mr. Bush, and earlier in the day he, Mr. Bush and Ms. Hughes had provided some details about the evolution of the relationship between the two men.</p>
        <p>According to these accounts, Mr. Bush had asked Mr. Cheney in March, right after the governor effectively secured his party's presidential nomination, if he would be willing to be considered for the vice presidential nomination. Mr. Cheney said no.</p>
        <p>But about three weeks ago, Ms. Hughes said, Mr. Bush asked Mr. Cheney again, and drew a different response.</p>
        <p>''This time,'' Mr. Bush said, ''he said he was willing to talk with his family and consider it.'' He smiled broadly, and Mr. Cheney reached over to his wife, Lynne, patted her on the shoulder, then held a pair of crossed fingers in the air. The crowd of about 200 supporters and friends of Mr. Bush laughed loudly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney provided an unusual physical counterpoint to Mr. Bush, whose facial expression and demeanor conveyed an almost boyish excitement. Mr. Cheney, by contrast, seemed to be trying to hide his grin. He often cast his eyes downward and could not decide what to do with his hands, which were alternately deep in his pockets or clasped modestly in front of him.</p>
