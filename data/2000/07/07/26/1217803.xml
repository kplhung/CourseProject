        <p>When James E. McGreevey held a fund-raiser last month that raised $3.2 million for New Jersey's Democratic Party, the event seemed a deft way to lay the financial and political groundwork for his run for governor in 2001.</p>
        <p>State law limits contributions to individual candidates to $1,800 per election cycle, but allows each donor to give up to $30,000 to the state party for the ill-defined purpose of ''party building.'' That distinction enabled Mr. McGreevey's $500-a-plate gala at the East Brunswick Hilton to set a record as the most lucrative fund-raiser in state history.</p>
        <p>But in the two weeks since Senator Robert G. Torricelli began publicly setting up his own bid for the Democratic nomination, Mr. McGreevey's plan has not gone as scripted.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Torricelli and Mr. McGreevey battling for endorsements, Mr. McGreevey's backers urged the state party last week to direct some of its bounty to county chairmen in South Jersey who were being wooed by Mr. Torricelli's allies.</p>
        <p>The state party chairman, Tom Giblin, refused to send the checks. Mr. Giblin, who now faces the prospect of a divisive primary, is instead suggesting a plan to divide part of the money evenly among the 21 counties. He also cautions that it is illegal for party funds, known as ''soft money,'' to be used to pay for an individual candidate's campaign.</p>
        <p>''I was not under the impression that this was a personal political 401(k) for Jim McGreevey,'' said Mr. Giblin, who has been supportive of Mr. McGreevey in the past but has not made an endorsement for governor. ''I thought it was done to help the 21 counties, the coordinated campaign as well as mayor's and council races throughout the state,'' Mr. Giblin said. ''The checks were made out to the state committee.''</p>
        <p>Those comments are a far cry from Mr. Giblin's statements to reporters on the night of the June 28 fund-raiser, when he said he expected that ''about half'' of the $3.2 million would be spent to bolster the party during Mr. McGreevey's run for governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giblin's about-face shows how drastically Mr. Torricelli's entry into the race has altered the political landscape. It also indicates just how bitter the competition between Mr. McGreevey and Mr. Torricelli has become.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli's supporters have accused Mr. McGreevey of trying to use the money to buy endorsements. State Senator John H. Adler, a Democrat from Cherry Hill, said he was present at a meeting of South Jersey party leaders where three chairmen acknowledged that they had been offered infusions of cash during the days when the fight for endorsements was most furious.</p>
        <p>''There was a sliding scale: $100,000 for Gloucester County, $75,000 for Atlantic County, $50,000 for Cumberland and $25,000 for Cape May,'' Mr. Adler said. ''I'm shocked that Jim McGreevey would participate in such a dirty scheme.</p>
        <p>''And I'm proud that there are people like Tom Giblin who couldn't be pressured into it.''</p>
        <p>But one of Mr. McGreevey's main political patrons, State Senator John Lynch of New Brunswick, said that Mr. Torricelli's entry into the race had divided Democrats and was hampering attempts to strengthen the party.</p>
        <p>Chuck Chiarello, the Democratic chairman in Atlantic County, confirmed that Mr. McGreevey had promised financial help for his organization, but insisted that there were no strings attached to the offer.</p>
        <p>''This is an outrage,'' Mr. Chiarello said. ''Jim McGreevey just raised $3.2 million for the party. We've never had that kind of money in our coffers. Just because someone is exploring an entry into the governor's race, that shouldn't derail the attempts to help us in areas where Democrats have been weak in recent years. We need the help.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey is in no position to alienate Mr. Giblin, who also serves as chairman in Essex County, so he tried to remain diplomatic about the dispute over the money. In an interview today, he said he was not troubled by his waning influence over how the party would spend the $3.2 million he helped raise.</p>
        <p>''This will all work itself out and the party will be stronger,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But some McGreevey supporters say privately that they fear the recent moves by Mr. Giblin, the state party chairman, mean that he is aligning himself with Mr. Torricelli.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giblin cautioned against jumping to conclusions.</p>
        <p>''I'm just trying to do what's best for the party in the long run,'' he said. '' People may be reading things into this that aren't really there.''</p>
