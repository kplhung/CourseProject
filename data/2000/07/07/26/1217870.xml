        <p>A homeless man who had been accused of smashing a woman on the head with a chunk of concrete was ordered released yesterday after prosecutors said that new evidence may exonerate him.</p>
        <p>The man, Bently Louis Grant, 35, has spent the last week in a mental health clinic  at the Rikers Island Detention Complex, and was expected to be released last night.</p>
        <p>The police had said that they had strong evidence that Mr. Grant attacked Tiffany F. Goldberg July 9 on a Midtown Manhattan street soon after she left a church. Investigators said their evidence included three witnesses and a confession that the police said Mr. Grant made during 20 hours of grilling at a precinct house.</p>
        <p>But people involved in the investigation said yesterday that security videotapes taken from a Virgin Records store at Union Square may provide Mr. Grant with an alibi, showing that he was at the store when the  attack took place.</p>
        <p>After prosecutors presented the new information in court yesterday, Justice John P. Walsh of Manhattan State Supreme Court granted their request that Mr. Grant be released.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Grant remains a suspect, his release would suggest that whoever attacked Ms. Goldberg is still at large. The attack was one of the most highly publicized crimes in the city this year, and it recalled an assault in Midtown last fall in which another woman, Nicole Barrett, had her skull smashed by a man wielding a paving stone.</p>
        <p>After Ms. Goldberg was attacked, the police carried out an intense hunt for the assailant, finally arresting Mr. Grant last week.</p>
        <p>In announcing yesterday's developments, the Manhattan district attorney released a statement saying prosecutors ''have discovered new evidence that raises substantial questions about Grant's identity as the perpetrator of the crimes.''</p>
        <p>A Police Department spokesman, Assistant Chief Thomas P. Fahey, said yesterday, ''We're after the truth, wherever it may take us.'' He said the investigation into the attack was continuing.</p>
        <p>Ms. Goldberg, 25, an aspiring social worker and a native of Madison, Wis., was attacked as she was walking on East 29th Street around noon after leaving Marble Collegiate Church.</p>
        <p>Hit in the head with a five-pound chunk of concrete, she fell face first to the pavement and was treated at Bellevue Hospital Center for a fractured skull, chipped teeth and cuts.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, she met with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to thank the city for its help and, before learning of Mr. Grant's release, she offered prayers to him.</p>
        <p>''It would really compound my suffering to see him handled in merely a punitive way,'' she said, ''and not to give regard to the healing he needs.''</p>
        <p>After the hearing that led to Mr. Grant's release, his court-appointed lawyer, Natasha Lapiner-Giresi, said that prosecutors did not tell her what the exonerating evidence might be. But she said that when she tried to subpoena security videotapes from Virgin Records and Kentucky Fried Chicken in Union Square, she learned that prosecutors had obtained the tapes on Monday.</p>
        <p>Ms. Giresi said that she was perturbed by Mr. Grant's confession.</p>
        <p>''I believe he did not hit Tiffany Goldberg on the head with a rock, and anything he said about it is because he was questioned for 20 hours,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grant has no previous criminal record and kept to himself, earning a living by recycling cans. Last week, when Police Commissioner Howard Safir was asked whether Mr. Grant had a history of mental problems, he said, ''Normal people do not hit people over the head with concrete.''</p>
