        <p>The main stock market gauges rose for the first time in three sessions yesterday, led by solid gains in big semiconductor companies like Intel and Applied Materials.</p>
        <p>But the rise in prices was far from uniform. On the New York Stock Exchange, the ratio of stocks that rose to those that lost value was about even.</p>
        <p>''It was a pretty lackluster session, but at least we finished in the green,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities. ''The one positive was a rebound in semiconductor stocks.''</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average rose a meager 14.85 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,699.97, led by Intel, Wal-Mart and Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>
        <p>Gains in Cisco Systems and Nortel Networks helped to lift the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index by 10.18 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,474.47.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index did better, gaining 48 points, or 1.2 percent, to 4,029.57.</p>
        <p>Over the previous two sessions, the Nasdaq had fallen 4.9 percent on concern that profit growth would slow in the third and fourth quarters.</p>
        <p>Chip-related stocks rallied after the Semiconductor Equipment Association of Japan said sales soared 126 percent in May. That report followed stronger-than-expected earnings from Texas Instruments, which posted its results after the market closed on Monday and painted a bright outlook for the rest of the year.</p>
        <p>Among chip stocks, Intel gained 2 7/8, to 140 7/8. Micron Technology rose 1 7/8, to 86 3/4. And Applied Materials rose 4, to 84 1/2.</p>
        <p>Aside from the news on semiconductor sales, there was not much to impress traders or investors.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, offered few insights during semiannual testimony before the House Banking Committee on whether policy makers will raise short-term interest rates at their Aug. 22 meeting.</p>
        <p>The lack of guidance places even greater importance on data that will be released over the next few weeks, including reports on second-quarter gross domestic product and the employment cost index, a key inflation measure. The employment cost index is scheduled to be released tomorrow. And the first estimate of second-quarter economic growth is expected on Friday.</p>
        <p>''Basically, Mr. Greenspan is saying they don't know what they are going to do on Aug. 22,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.</p>
        <p>Mr. Piskorowski added, ''Greenspan made it plain they are waiting to see what the data are showing before they will make a decision.''</p>
        <p>Drug shares were generally weak yesterday after a report from Pfizer showed slower-than-expected revenue growth.</p>
        <p>Pfizer fell 3 7/8, to 43 11/16. Bristol-Myers Squibb lost 1 9/64, to 48 13/16. Schering-Plough dropped 1 61/64, to 43 5/16. And Eli Lilly eked out a gain of 3/64 after slipping earlier, and ended at 10 13/16.</p>
        <p>Amazon.com was another loser. Shares of the Internet retailer fell 1 1/8, to 37 5/8, after the company said Joseph Galli, its president and chief operating officer, was leaving to become chief executive of VerticalNet Inc. Mr. Galli had held those positions for only a year.</p>
        <p>Reuters Group, the financial information provider, rose 3 3/4, to 119 1/4, after it reported that first-half earnings soared 75 percent, in large part because of higher revenue from Instinet, its online trading network.</p>
        <p>But MedQuist tumbled 12 3/8, or 40 percent, to 18 13/16, after the medical records transcriber reported operating profits that were weaker than expected.</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>Treasury Prices Mixed</p>
        <p>(By Bloomberg News) -- Bond prices were mixed yesterday on speculation that the Federal Reserve was less likely to raise interest rates at its Aug. 22 meeting.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, in comments to the House Banking Committee, said a decision on interest rate policy would depend on the economic data coming in the next few weeks.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/32, to 106 8/32. The bond's yield remained at 5.81 percent.</p>
        <p>The price of the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 103 8/32; its yield was 6.03 percent.</p>
