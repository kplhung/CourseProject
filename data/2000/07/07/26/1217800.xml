        <p>Swiss officials are investigating whether $4.8 billion paid to Russia by the International Monetary Fund in 1998 was laundered through Swiss banks in transactions involving the Bank of New York, according to investigative documents that revive questions thought to have been resolved.</p>
        <p>A Geneva investigating magistrate, Laurent Kaspar-Ansermet, earlier this month asked banks in a southern area, Ticino, for help in locating accounts through which the money might have passed.</p>
        <p>In a letter to the banks, Mr. Kaspar-Ansermet referred to ''certain elements of information'' indicating that the $4.8 billion had been deposited in a Ticino bank account opened in the name of the Ost-West Handelsbank, a German affiliate of the Russian central bank, and an Austrian bank, Creditanstalt, before it was funneled to banks in other countries.</p>
        <p>The investigation is remarkable because the I.M.F. commissioned an audit by PriceWaterhouseCoopers last year that cleared the Russian central bank of wrongdoing in handling the money.</p>
        <p>Officials of Ost-West Handelsbank were not available for comment. A Creditanstalt spokesman in Vienna, Peter Thier, denied that his company, now part of Bank Austria, had accounts in Ticino or any contact with Ost-West Handelsbank.</p>
        <p>According to the letter, obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Kaspar-Ansermet last October began an inquiry into money-laundering charges against Peter Berlin and Lucy Edwards, former Bank of New York employees, who would later admit similar offenses in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaspar-Ansermet said by telephone that judicial secrecy prevented him from commenting. But he indicated that the letter was only one element in the investigation.</p>
        <p>According to the letter, the $4.8 billion of I.M.F. money was supposedly deposited in the Ticino account on Aug. 14, 1998. On that day or soon after, transfers totaling almost $7 billion were made from the account to banks in Britain, Australia, Switzerland and the United States, including a payment of $1.4 billion to the Bank of New York.</p>
        <p>Tom Dawson, the I.M.F.'s director of external relations, said that the agency was aware of the Swiss inquiry, but that it had ''received no information that contradicts what is in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.''</p>
        <p>The I.M.F. ordered the examination of the Russian central bank's handling of the $4.8 billion after accusations arose that the money had been funneled into private accounts outside Russia. But auditors found that the money had been distributed to roughly 18 Russian commercial banks to support the ruble's value.</p>
        <p>The report strongly criticized the central bank's use of a Channel Islands finance company, Fimaco, in the transactions.</p>
        <p>Officials said that the transactions outlined in Mr. Kaspar-Ansermet's letter seemed virtually identical to those that were asserted last year in Moscow by Viktor Ilyukhin, a Communist legislator, that were examined by I.M.F. auditors and found to be inaccurate.</p>
        <p>In his letter, for instance, Mr. Kaspar-Ansermet states that the $4.8 billion was transferred from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in one payment on Aug. 14, 1998, when in fact it was doled out piecemeal over several days. He also cites a transfer of $2.35 billion from the Ticino account to the Bank of Sydney, Australia, though the I.M.F. found that no such bank exists.</p>
