      <abstract>
        <p>Gov George W Bush's campaign says Bush personally screened Dick Cheney before choosing him as running mate; says Cheney screened his other possible running mates, continuing search process even after he knew he was in running, to make sure Bush had other options; Bush says he named Cheney to head search process only after Cheney declined his offer of vice presidential nomination in Mar (M)</p>

        <p>In the end, it was Gov. George W. Bush himself who did the final, most sensitive background check on the man who was supposed to be the one running the vice presidential screening process.</p>
        <p>So just as Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary, had met with other finalists to go over questions about their personal lives and finances, Mr. Bush questioned Mr. Cheney. As Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's spokeswoman put it, ''In this case, Governor Bush served as the chair of the search committee.''</p>
        <p>That was just one of the oddities of a vice-presidential search process that turned in on itself.</p>
        <p>At one point, in fact, only a couple of weeks ago Mr. Cheney flew to Washington to conduct interviews with some of the other candidates. But at the same time, he quietly visited his doctors for a physical. He met with his doctors the next day, July 12, and they gave him a clean bill of health, Ms. Hughes said.</p>
        <p>And that night he called Mr. Bush to tell him there was no reason why he could not accept the nomination.</p>
        <p>Yet at the same time, he continued the search process, Ms. Hughes said, because he wanted to make sure Mr. Bush had other options.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's courtship of Mr. Cheney began in March, just after the Republican primaries had ended. Mr. Bush said he asked if Mr. Cheney would be willing to be considered as a running mate. ''At the time,'' Mr. Bush said today, ''he said no.''</p>
        <p>So the governor instead on April 25 named Mr. Cheney, now chief executive of a giant oil field service company in Dallas, as the head of his vice-presidential search process. But even then, he said today, ''I kept the thought of him joining me in the back of my mind.''</p>
        <p>In the interim, Mr. Bush sent out hundreds of letters to party leaders asking for their input. A list of vice-presidential finalists received detailed questionnaires asking about their health, their finances, their voting records, their military records.</p>
        <p>''It took me two weeks to pull together everything required on that vast questionnaire,'' said Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. ''It meant getting my business partners involved, my accountants involved, tax people, doctors, my staff, family. The questionnaire, as you can imagine is rather intense. It's your whole life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagel praised Mr. Cheney's selection, despite the work he had had to do. ''My goodness, here's a guy who has the character, the competence, the experience, the ability,'' Mr. Hagel said. ''I don't have any problem with that at all.''</p>
        <p>The questionnaires came back to the campaign. But this month once again, Mr. Bush circled back to Mr. Cheney. It was the Fourth of July weekend, and the two men were reviewing options at Mr. Bush's ranch.</p>
        <p>After lunch, the two men walked out to the back porch and once again Mr. Bush asked Mr. Cheney whether he would be willing to be considered.</p>
        <p>''I was impressed,'' Mr. Bush said today, ''by the thoughtful and thorough way he approached his mission. And gradually I realized that the person who was best qualified to be my vice-presidential nominee was working by my side.''</p>
        <p>This time Mr. Cheney said yes.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Cheney began reviewing not just a handful of finalists, but also himself. ''He knew, he said, at that point that he would have to begin looking at his own business, his own medical records, his own background,'' Ms. Hughes said.</p>
        <p>Still, the search continued. That week Mr. Bush discussed the vice presidency with Gov. George E. Pataki of New York on a campaign trip into New Jersey and New York.</p>
        <p>A day later, on July 15, Mr. Bush summoned his three top aides -- Ms. Hughes, Karl Rove and Joe Allbaugh -- to meet with him, his wife, Laura, and Mr. Cheney. ''We talked through the ramifications of the leader of the search becoming a potential candidate in that search,'' Ms. Hughes said. Mr. Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, declined today to spell out the considerations but said, ''Obviously, they were not grave.''</p>
        <p>The next day, the vetting of Mr. Cheney began. Mr. Allbaugh, the campaign manager, oversaw the examination of Mr. Cheney's voting record and public history. How well he did should soon become apparent. Already tonight, on his first television appearance, on CNN's ''Larry King Live,'' Mr. Cheney was answering questions about his Congressional vote against the Head Start program and his uncompromising opposition to abortion in all cases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides said Mr. Cheney's past was not unknown territory. Mr. Cheney, who had a long government career, had been screened by the F.B.I. three times and had undergone Senate confirmation hearings. As defense secretary under former President Bush, he had held the nation's highest security clearance.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush decided he wanted an independent review of Mr. Cheney's health. He called his father, the former President, and asked him to ask his friend the noted Houston heart surgeon, Denton A. Cooley, to speak to Mr. Cheney's doctors.</p>
        <p>On July 18, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney met with another of the vice-presidential contenders, John C. Danforth, a former senator from Missouri, and his wife.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes said Mr. Bush himself at some point talked with Mr. Cheney about his personal and financial background, but she did not provide further detail. Since leaving his defense post, Mr. Cheney has been the chief executive officer of the Halliburton Company, a worldwide oil field services company that has paid him millions of dollars in salary and stock options.</p>
        <p>There are signs that Mr. Bush's father was taking an interest in the search, and a specific interest in Mr. Cheney. Ms. Hughes today described the former president's role as ''that of a loving father,'' ready to lend an ear to his son. Asked if the former president supported Mr. Cheney above all candidates, she said she was ''sure he spoke highly of several of them.'' She said she did not know whether he had personally called Mr. Cheney to lobby him.</p>
        <p>This morning, Mr. Bush called Mr. Cheney at his home in Dallas and asked him to be his running mate. Hours later they stood together here in Austin before a crowd waving red white and blue pompoms.</p>
        <p>''In the end,'' Mr. Cheney said of Mr. Bush, ''I learned how persuasive he can be.''</p>
