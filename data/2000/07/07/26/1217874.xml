        <p>When the news from Washington crackled through on their transistor radios, a group of Jewish men keeping vigil atop the Mount of Olives broke into songs of praise that East Jerusalem, spread out before them in the setting sun, would not, at least for now, be reverting to any form of Arab control.</p>

        <p>When the news from Washington crackled through on their transistor radios, a group of Jewish men keeping vigil atop the Mount of Olives broke into songs of praise that East Jerusalem, spread out before them in the setting sun, would not, at least for now, be reverting to any form of Arab control.</p>
        <p>From dawn, the cluster of ultra-conservative ''rejectionists'' -- rabbis, professors and right-wing sectarian leaders who have opposed peace talks with Israel's Arab neighbors since the original Camp David talks in 1978 -- had been encamped above the Jewish cemeteries that cascade down the hillside. Through the heat of the day, they prayed, fasted and alternated readings from the Torah and the Talmud, imploring God to condemn the latest Camp David talks to failure.</p>
        <p>About 6 p.m., when the Voice of Israel announced that the talks between Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, had failed over the future status of Jerusalem, the mood became triumphal. In moments, the biblical songs began ringing out across the valley toward the Temple Mount on the other side where Arabs, at the Dome of the Rock, and Jews, at the Western Wall, were gathering at dusk to pay their separate obeisances to God.</p>
        <p>''We've been praying all day that God would intervene and prevent this disaster from befalling the people of Israel,'' said Baruch Ben-Yosef, a 41-year-old rabbi who came to Israel from New York as a teenager. ''Now, our prayers have been answered. Barak has been stopped from selling out the land of Israel.''</p>
        <p>But on an evening that many Jews and Palestinians described as marking a watershed in their shared history, the certainties of the men atop the Mount of Olives were rare. As the news spread across this ancient city, from television sets in cafes and bars, from radios in the bazaars of the Old City, and by the mobile phones that have Israelis and Palestinians engaging in seemingly nonstop talk, the more common reaction seemed to be one of disappointment, confusion and even of fear.</p>
        <p>What mainly emerged from a random sounding of reaction across the city was a mood suggesting that many here, on both sides, had been forced into accepting harsh realities they always knew were likely to overwhelm the hopes and dreams nurtured by more than two decades of on-and-off peace talks.</p>
        <p>In a dozen conversations, the common thread was a sense that Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat, in dashing the hopes of a final peace agreement, had bowed to a gap, irreducible now and possibly for a long time to come, between the competing political visions of their constituents.</p>
        <p>On the issue of Jerusalem, it seemed from these conversations, it is not only hard-liners like the men atop the Mount of Olives, but also many others on both sides who consider themselves secularists and moderates who are not yet ready for the historic concessions that would have been necessary under President Clinton's compromise plan.</p>
        <p>A Palestinian shopkeeper from Bethlehem, Ismail Kanan, caught the mood of many other Palestinians when he said he was bitterly disappointed that the talks had ended without agreement, because the two sides, in Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat, had leaders who were as flexible as they were likely to get. During 20 years, he said, Jews and Arabs had learned that ''we are all humans, we all want to live, and we have to recognize each others' needs.''</p>
        <p>But the 36-year-old shopkeeper had a crucial condition.</p>
        <p>Dressed in a flowing white robe and a banded white headdress, he said ordinary Palestinians like himself could never accustom themselves to getting back parts of East Jerusalem piecemeal. ''Barak cannot make a deal without conceding control of East Jerusalem,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Not far away, before the Damascus Gate in the Old City wall that leads on to the Dome of the Rock, two other Palestinian men paused on their way from a pizza supper to evening prayers. Daoud Abdelhadi, a 44-year-old hairdresser, and Mohanad Awad, an insurance salesman, 43, both from Palestinian-controlled Ramallah on the West Bank, were among the few strollers who appeared not to have heard about the collapse of the talks, perhaps because they spent much of the afternoon on an overcrowded bus.</p>
        <p>Told that there was to be no peace pact, at least not this time, they were visibly dismayed. ''It's a bad thing, a very bad thing,'' Mr. Abdelhadi said, shaking his head. He described Palestinians as ''tired, so very tired'' by the long years of struggle dating to the founding of Israel in 1948, and desperate for relief from the kind of inconveniences he said the two men had faced in making their journey to Jerusalem. They were forced by Israeli rules, he said, to come by bus rather than by car, held up for repeated scrutiny of identity papers at Israeli checkpoints, and denied, in Mr. Abdelhadi's case, the right to bring his 17-year-old son, who lacked the right papers, to Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>But after a short discussion, the men turned their frustration not against Mr. Barak, nor Mr. Arafat, whom they said had made the right choice in holding out for broader concessions on Jerusalem, but against Mr. Clinton. ''I'll tell you this,'' Mr. Abdelhadi said. ''If the United States wants to do something to correct the wrongs done to the Palestinian people, it can do it, no problem, it has the power over Israel.''</p>
        <p>At the Wailing Wall, the same mood of disappointment, mixed with a reluctant acceptance that Jews and Arabs remain too far apart for any final peace, was palpable among the sort of young and middle-aged Jews, many of them in college or professional careers, who have formed much of Mr. Barak's constituency. In several conversations, most said the concessions that Mr. Barak offered were too much, not too little.</p>
        <p>A high school teacher from Tel Aviv, Ruthie Sneer, 42, said she had been traveling to Jerusalem with her husband, Ethan, a lawyer, and friends when the radio on their chartered bus brought the news. Some aboard the bus had cheered, others groaned, and still others had kept quiet, she said. She described herself as ''confused, very confused,'' having yearned so long for peace, yet concluded, in recent days, that the price was too high.</p>
        <p>Ceding control of any part of East Jerusalem, she said, would have ''touched every Jew in his soul.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''But I want to tell you something: If I was sure it would be a real peace, a final and lasting peace, if I believed Arafat 100 percent, I would be willing to have our government concede even this, control over the Wailing Wall. I wouldn't even mind coming here as Arafat's guest. The trouble is, I don't trust him that much, and I don't think many Jews do.''  IMPASSE AT CAMP DAVID: JERUSALEM'S MOOD</p>
