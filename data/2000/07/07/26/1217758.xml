        <p>The Internet Age Comes to Studio 54</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, it was the playground for the likes of Andy and Bianca and Halston. On Monday, Studio 54 was the playground for the likes of DAVID BOWIE and LAUREN HUTTON and MARTHA STEWART -- and Internet types who are about the age that those three were when disco was hot and music was not yet downloadable.</p>
        <p>Studio 54, now a theater, was where the Yahoo! Internet Life Music Awards were given out. Mr. Bowie got the ''online pioneer'' award -- he founded UltraStar, an Internet entertainment company, and created BowieNet, which was hailed as the first artist-designed Internet service provider. But even he draws the line somewhere.</p>
        <p>''A start-up guy approached myself and Iman earlier,'' he said, referring to his pregnant wife, IMAN. ''He offered us something called 'Wombcam.' I said 'thanks, but we'll pass on that.' ''</p>
        <p>There were those who reminisced about the old days (and nights) at Studio 54. NILE RODGERS, who produced some of Mr. Bowie's recordings, said he realized that his song ''Dance, Dance, Dance'' would climb the charts at Studio 54. ''The dance floor was pretty empty,'' he said. ''But when they heard my song, the floor was packed, wall-to-wall people dancing to the music. I knew I had a hit.''</p>
        <p>And now?</p>
        <p>''I'm all for music on the Internet,'' Mr. Rodgers said. ''I'm all for Napster -- as long as I get paid for my music.'' (Napster is software that allows fans to distribute music freely among themselves.)</p>
        <p>But back to the 70's. Miss Hutton said she used to go to Studio 54, but only ''if I hadn't been to Africa in a long time.''</p>
        <p>''You could watch herd behavior,'' she said. ''It was sad and tragic. People were taking massive amounts of drugs and behaving crazily. And they played terrible disco music. It was awful. But it was a phenomenon, and it lasted a long time, five years or so.''</p>
        <p>Putting It Asunder</p>
        <p>Soap opera fans have been watching the unraveling of a marriage that MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI presided over. On Oct. 28, 1998, the mayor went to the studio where ''The Guiding Light'' is videotaped and, on a set that had been decorated to look like his office, officiated at the wedding of two characters. This being a soap opera, it was the groom's fifth marriage and the bride's third.</p>
        <p>They were supposed to live happily ever after, of course, but Beth, the ex-wife of the groom, Philip, was still in the script. Somehow -- again, this is a soap opera -- she and Philip and Philip's new wife all lived in the same mansion.</p>
        <p>Then Philip and Beth were on an airplane that crashed. One of the other survivors went for help, leaving Philip and Beth alone with nothing to do but act romantic. Beth became pregnant, and there were other plot twists -- a diagnosis that pointed to a bone-marrow transplant, for example. Now it looks as if Philip's wife wants nothing to do with him anymore.</p>
        <p>''It was interesting to see that this marriage fell apart at the same time the mayor's did, by coincidence,'' said BARBARA ESENSTEN, who was a head writer on ''The Guiding Light'' until last month. ''We certainly don't blame Mayor Giuliani for the breakup of our characters. It speaks to our time.''</p>
        <p>Great Ones' Feet</p>
        <p>FRANZ XAVER OHNESORG, the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall, and NIGEL KENNEDY, a violinist, found themselves on a stage together on Monday, and neither was performing. Heavy rain pounded the Verbier Festival's tent in Verbier, Switzerland, and the performers -- including the conductor JAMES LEVINE and the baritone DMITRI BOROSTOWSKY -- agreed to let the audience onto the stage. ''I didn't expect so many people to come around and sit, literally, at their feet,'' said MARTIN ENGSTROEM, a Swedish impresario who started the festival in 1994.</p>
