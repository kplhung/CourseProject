        <p>Two top former officials of District Council 37 were convicted yesterday of helping rig the 1995 contract ratification vote at the giant union of municipal workers.</p>
        <p>After four hours of deliberating, a jury in State Supreme Court in Manhattan convicted Martin Lubin, the council's former associate director and former No. 2 official, and Albert A. Diop, who was president of a 24,000-member union local representing administrative assistants.</p>
        <p>''These were significant cases,'' said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney. ''They show you can't rig elections and get away with it.''</p>
        <p>Officials at the 125,000-member district council said Mr. Lubin ran it day to day, while Stanley Hill, the former executive director, focused on political matters and meetings with members. Mr. Diop, whose local was the second-biggest in the council, which has 56 locals, was known as a powerful figure who worked behind the scenes and exerted considerable influence on Mr. Hill.</p>
        <p>Insisting that the verdict was wrong, lawyers for Mr. Lubin and Mr. Diop said they planned to appeal.</p>
        <p>During the two-week trial, several witnesses tied Mr. Lubin and Mr. Diop to the vote fraud. Mark Shaplo, who had been Mr. Lubin's top assistant, said that he and Mr. Lubin marked bogus ballots together in an elaborate secret operation. Mr. Shaplo, who has pleaded guilty to vote fraud and embezzlement, testified that they switched pens, alternately using their left and right hands, to avoid the appearance that the same person was marking all the ballots.</p>
        <p>The former chairwoman of the election committee of Mr. Diop's local testified that he had ordered that 5,000 extra ballots be printed to make it easier to forge votes. The chairwoman, Marie Alston Diggens, also said that Mr. Diop ordered that she change his local's official vote count to add 800 extra ''yes'' votes and to subtract 800 ''no'' votes.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said the ballot stuffing in Mr. Diop's local was pivotal to ensuring the ratification of the contract, which many workers vehemently objected to because it contained a two-year wage freeze. In early 1996, council officials announced that 19,513 union members had voted for ratification and 14,438 against.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diop was convicted on two charges, scheming to defraud and falsifying business records, but was acquitted on a forgery charge. Mr. Lubin was convicted on two charges, scheming to defraud and forgery.</p>
        <p>Justice Bonnie Wittner of State Supreme Court in Manhattan let Mr. Diop, 65, remain free on $125,000 bail and let Mr. Lubin, 59, remain free on $25,000 bail. Mr. Diop faces up to four years in prison and Mr. Lubin up to seven years, with sentencing scheduled for Sept. 7.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diop, who long rented the penthouse at district council headquarters, faces a separate trial on Sept. 17 on charges that he embezzled more than $2 million from his local. He has repeatedly asserted his innocence on those charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lubin's attorney, Pamela Hayes, said Mr. Shaplo and several other witnesses falsely implicated Mr. Lubin to curry favor with prosecutors as a way to minimize their sentences. Mr. Shaplo and several other witnesses have pleaded guilty to embezzlement and vote fraud.</p>
        <p>''Marty is not a person who was stealing and pillaging,'' she said. ''This whole thing is a tragedy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Diop's attorney, Ramon Pagan, said the verdict should be overturned, asserting that the judge's jury instructions were incorrect and that several witnesses were lying to obtain lighter sentences.</p>
        <p>In the two-year investigation of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, more than two dozen officials have been indicted or pleaded guilty.</p>
        <p>''This is not an anti-labor prosecution,'' Mr. Morgenthau said. ''It's a pro-labor prosecution. The victims were the union members.''</p>
        <p>One of the biggest surprises at the trial occurred when Gary Tenenbaum, the former president of a local representing recreation employees, implicated the district council's director of bargaining, Dennis Sullivan. Mr. Tenenbaum said that after his local's members had voted 35 to 4 in favor of the contract, he changed the count to say the vote was 135 to 4. Mr. Tenenbaum then testified that Mr. Sullivan altered those totals to a still false 93 to 6.</p>
        <p>In subsequent testimony, Mr. Shaplo contradicted Mr. Tenenbaum and seemingly cleared Mr. Sullivan by testifying that he, not Mr. Sullivan, had altered the totals to 93 to 6.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan, who is heading district council 37's ongoing negotiations with the Giuliani administration, has repeatedly asserted he knew nothing about the vote rigging.</p>
        <p>Lee Saunders, the official who was appointed trustee to clean up the district council, issued a statement saying those officials who embezzled money and denied union members a fair ratification vote deserved to pay for their actions.</p>
        <p>''We are transforming this union into one that makes headlines for what it does right, not what some of its officials did wrong,'' he said.</p>
