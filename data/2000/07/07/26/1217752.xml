        <p>The cottage cellar door seems to lead to a basement toolshed. Actually it is the disguised entrance to the ''Temple of Man,'' a five-story underground warren of vast, ornately decorated chambers, with towering pillars, 40-foot-high gold-leaf ceilings, giant frescoes and bronze statues, all linked by narrow passages and concealed stone doors that spring open and shut by electrical command.</p>
        <p>The temple looks like a cross between Xanadu and the subterranean headquarters of a Bond villain plotting world domination. Begun more than 20 years ago in total secrecy, it is the spiritual core of Damanhur, a 23-year-old New Age commune nestled, somewhat improbably, amid tiny rural villages in the Piedmont valley of Valchiusella, in the foothills of the Alps.</p>
        <p>Members reject the term cult, describing their commune as a nation, one that aims at total self-sufficiency and boasts its own currency, schools, federal and local government, newspapers, Web site and tax code. It also claims to have its own unique transportation system: time travel.</p>
        <p>But the oddest thing about Damanhur is not its belief system, but the way it has melded California-style New Age spirituality with the customs and mores of northern Italy. When its 500 full-time residents are not experimenting with time travel and ''Selfic'' healing, they are industriously churning out luxury items for export.</p>
        <p>One Damanhur workshop makes Tiffany-style glass products. Another business, Atelier Damjl, makes  silk and cashmere fabrics on 18th-century wooden looms for Loro Piana and other top Italian fashion houses.</p>
        <p>''We were never hippies,'' Damanhur's founder, Oberto Airaudi, a former insurance salesman from Turin who goes by the name Falco (Falcon), explained as he drove his silver Volvo station wagon up steep mountain roads to the temple's helicopter pad. ''We believed in hard work, personal responsibility and bank loans. It was our own version of the American dream, all built with our own hands.''</p>
        <p>A Damanhurian candidate won the mayoral election in nearby Vidracco last year, and the commune has town councilors in half a dozen other small villages, worrying some locals who fear that the commune, which keeps buying land, will soon rule the area. But Damanhur's political goals are hardly unorthodox: the commune wants a tax exemption.</p>
        <p>Damanhur, which took its name from an ancient Egyptian city, also shares the Italian aversion to ironclad rules and has only one: no smoking. Everything else is pretty much permitted, including long lunches that include wine, pasta and meat, which may help explain why the community has remained intact for more than two decades.</p>
        <p>''There is no place I can think of in the States with such successful continuity,'' said David Fuess, 53, a visiting acupuncturist from Carmel, Calif. Mr. Fuess, who uses Damanhur's gold ''Selfic'' needles in his healing practice back home, said he was troubled by only one aspect. ''I'd like to see them be totally vegetarian,'' he said wistfully.</p>
        <p>He spoke after attending a packed lecture on the hidden risks of time travel given by Mr. Airaudi. Those include being inadvertently transported to an ''inhospitable'' primeval forest and being chased by wolves.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Airaudi started it, Damanhur was a semi-clandestine society that drew Italian students and young professionals searching for spirituality, paranormal research and a Marxist rejection of private property. Members shed their civil names and adopt animal first names and vegetable surnames. A current ''king-guide'' for example, is named Gorilla Eucalipto.</p>
        <p>Damanhurians began digging their temple in secret, carrying buckets by hand to carry out discarded earth and stone. After rumors of a mysterious sect spread across the valley, Damanhurians erected a false temple, in ancient Egyptian style, above the real one as a decoy.</p>
        <p>But the real temple came to light in 1992 when one founding member decided to quit the commune and threatened to expose its doings unless all his worldly goods were restored. Turning over one's assets to the commune is one of the prerequisites to full citizenship.</p>
        <p>The dispute went to court, and baffled Italian judges eventually ruled in favor of the commune, but it was forced to pay back taxes on the temple. Mr. Airaudi says work is still continuing to dig newer underground chambers, 10 times as big.</p>
        <p>In the late 1980's, Damanhur dispensed with its early collectivist spirit and secrecy, and it has since embraced capitalism and Internet-driven public relations (www. Damanhur.it ). Tourists can tour the temple for a $40 fee, and its bustling workshops, healing centers and guesthouses offer paid spiritual retreats and seminars.</p>
        <p>But Damanhur's ardent work ethic and spiritual zeal wears thin on some of the group's teenagers. ''I don't exclude returning someday, but right now I am sick of it,'' said 18-year-old Cinciallegra (Titmouse), a.k.a. Melissa Baracco.</p>
        <p>She has lived in Damanhur since the age of 6. Her hair is dyed a defiant, non-organic pink, and she smokes -- off the premises. She said she yearned to travel and be a normal teenage slacker. ''Sometimes I just want to do nothing,'' she explained.</p>
        <p>Mostly, the commune draws middle-aged people interested in mysticism and the paranormal. ''It is a deep, holistic, growthful environment,'' Peta Lynne, 50, a visitor from the Hawaiian island of Kauai, who described her day job there as a ''channeler.''</p>
        <p>When she began explaining how she rediscovers past lives, she was cut off by Esperide Ananas (Butterfly Pineapple), or Silvia Buffagni, Damanhur's director of international public relations. Ms. Buffagni rolled her eyes and impatiently explained that Damanhur took a less ''fluffy'' approach to channeling, a somewhat rigid distinction coming from one who claimed to have witnessed a fellow Damanhurian travel through time to Atlantis.</p>
        <p>Residents along the valley, who live in villages deserted by young people fleeing rural life and the absence of jobs, express guarded admiration -- and concern about their neighbor's expansion.</p>
        <p>''They pay taxes, and I am not saying they haven't done some good things: repainting Vidracco, adding a children's park and other aesthetic touches,'' said Domenico Troia Cionin, the mayor of Baldissero Canavese, referring to improvements made by the Damanhurian mayor of Vidracco two miles away. ''But we feel a little like Indians in the American West when the cowboys came. They tried to resist, and utterly failed.''</p>
