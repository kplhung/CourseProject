        <p>The making -- and drinking -- of beer and wine has been a venerated tradition throughout human history, a fact brought to life in ''Drink and Be Merry: Wine and Beer in Ancient Times,'' an exhibition opening on Sunday at the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue (92nd Street). It includes nearly 200 objects from Greece, Rome, Egypt and the Middle East, like Italian wine jars inscribed to King Herod and a portion of the Dead Sea Scrolls on a festival of new wine, perhaps the Beaujolais of its day. There is also a reproduction of an ancient wine shop. At left is an Egyptian figurine of a woman making beer circa 2035-1650 B.C.</p>
