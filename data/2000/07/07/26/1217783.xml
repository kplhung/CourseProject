        <p>Palestinian officials said after the Camp David summit meeting ended without an agreement today that they would press ahead with plans to declare an independent state on Sept. 13, whatever the consequences.</p>
        <p>The officials asserted that Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, had made all the concessions possible from the Palestinian side before going into the meeting, and that the firm stance that he apparently took at Camp David would boost his standing among his own people. They contended that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel was responsible for the impasse.</p>
        <p>''This will produce full support for Mr. Arafat and strengthen his credibility from the point of view of the Palestinians,'' said Marwan Barghouti, a West Bank leader of Mr. Arafat's Fatah movement, the mainstream group in the Palestine Liberation Organization. ''We have to start to prepare for the declaration of the state.''</p>
        <p>The Israelis and Palestinians had set Sept. 13 as the deadline for a final peace agreement. Mr. Arafat has asserted that he will declare statehood this year, with or without an accord.</p>
        <p>Fatah called for a general strike and demonstrations in support of Mr. Arafat in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Wednesday. That raised concerns among Israeli Army officers that demonstrators might clash with Israeli soldiers, although Mr. Barghouti said his group would keep the peace.</p>
        <p>After months of accusations by Palestinian critics that Mr. Arafat  had failed to stand up to the Israelis, his apparent insistence at Camp David on Palestinian sovereignty in East Jerusalem and on formal recognition of the right of return for Palestinian refugees was expected to earn him a hero's welcome from supporters when he returns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat ''proved to be one of the last of the historic leaders, because he said no at the moment when no one says no to America,'' said Freih Abu Medein, the justice minister in Mr. Arafat's cabinet.</p>
        <p>Even Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the militant Islamic movement Hamas, had words of praise for his political foe. ''I welcome his steadfastness,'' he said in Gaza. ''There is no choice but the choice of resistance. What was taken by force must be returned by force.''</p>
        <p>Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a top aide to Mr. Arafat, accused Mr. Barak of scuttling the talks by insisting on his self-declared ''red lines.'' These positions would bar Palestinian sovereignty in East Jerusalem, formal recognition of the right of return of the refugees and a full withdrawal from the West Bank.</p>
        <p>''We had hoped for success, but unfortunately we kept bumping into these noes, which were the main reason for the crippling of the peace process,'' Mr. Abdel Rahim said.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Abdel Rahim said, the end of the summit meeting ''doesn't mean that the peace process will collapse.''</p>
        <p>''We are ready to continue efforts to push the peace process forward,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Arafat is under pressure from his supporters to declare a state on Sept. 13, regardless of whether it might provoke violent confrontation with the Israelis, who have said they would respond by annexing areas of the West Bank still under Israeli control.</p>
        <p>''We will persist in declaring the sovereignty of the Palestinian state -- our date is Sept. 13,'' said Hani al-Hassan, a member of Fatah's central committee and a longtime comrade in arms of Mr. Arafat. ''We are ready to bear the consequences.''</p>
        <p>Officials insisted that Mr. Arafat had reached the limit of his concessions even before the Camp David meeting because he had already recognized Israeli sovereignty over 80 percent of what used to be British-ruled Palestine and over the western half of Jerusalem. The said he could not compromise on what was left: the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>By hinting that it was Mr. Barak who went the extra mile at Camp David, President Clinton was taking the Israeli side, Mr. Abu Medein said. He contended that Mr. Clinton had also placed the blame on the late Syrian leader, Hafez al-Assad, after an unsuccessful meeting several months ago in Geneva to restart Syrian-Israeli negotiations.</p>
        <p>Faisal Husseini, the top Palestinian leader in Jerusalem, said that despite the failure to reach an agreement at Camp David, the meeting had begun the process of resolving the dispute over the Holy City.</p>
        <p>''The taboo on opening the file of Jerusalem has vanished,'' he said. ''This file has been opened, and we hope it will generate more discussion in the Israeli community and that we can reach a solution before Sept. 13. I don't believe that this is the end.''</p>
