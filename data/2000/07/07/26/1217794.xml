        <p>As he skated around the ice, it was difficult to tell Rick DiPietro, the Islanders' No. 1 draft choice, from the kids he was teaching at a goaltending clinic.

        <p>DiPietro, the first goalie to be selected as the top overall pick in National Hockey League history, signed a three-year contract today.

        <p>As he skated around the ice, it was difficult to tell Rick DiPietro, the Islanders' No. 1 draft choice, from the kids he was teaching at a goaltending clinic. Wearing a sweater with the No. 1 and his name on the back was all that seemed to distinguish DiPietro from the campers, some of whom were only three years younger than the 18-year-old goaltender.</p>
        <p>DiPietro, the first goalie to be selected as the top overall pick in National Hockey League history, signed a three-year contract today. He recalled how Tom Barrasso, at age 18, went directly from Acton-Boxboro High School in Massachusetts to the Buffalo Sabres and was named the rookie of the year in the 1983-84 season.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, there is going to be a lot of pressure put on me,'' DiPietro said. ''We let go of two great goaltenders. You've got to remember, I'm a young guy. I'm only 18 years old, so it's a long shot for any 18-year-old to make an N.H.L. squad right away.''</p>
        <p>The Islanders traded goaltenders Roberto Luongo and Kevin Weekes on draft day to make room for DiPietro, who played only one season at Boston University.</p>
        <p>''I've been working out pretty hard and trying to get myself focused,'' DiPietro said. ''Hopefully, I can have a successful camp, and wherever the New York Islanders feel best to put me, that's where I'll go.''</p>
        <p>Regarded as possessing puck-handling skills superior to most N.H.L. goaltenders, DiPietro found it hard to believe that he could be a starter in the N.H.L. when this season begins. The Islanders, however, did take out an insurance policy by acquiring John Vanbiesbrouck, 36, a day after the draft, providing DiPietro with a mentor and a capable backup.</p>
        <p>''You mention John Vanbiesbrouck in the same breath as you do all the other great American goalies,'' DiPietro said. ''Sitting next to him in the locker room, seeing what he has to say about his experiences is a wonderful tool for me and something that hopefully I'll be able to use to my benefit.</p>
        <p>''They mentioned they were going to try to get an older, experienced goaltender and I don't think they could have picked a better guy. I don't think it's hit me yet. I think maybe in late August when I step in that locker room for the first time and put on the gear next to a guy like John Vanbiesbrouck, it's going to actually hit me what I've done.''</p>
        <p>DiPietro said that he would not mind serving as the No. 2 goaltender behind Vanbiesbrouck, and he would also accept starting the season in the minors if necessary.</p>
        <p>He believes, however, that he is ready to learn on the N.H.L. level. The Islanders, who had made Luongo the highest-drafted goaltender only three years ago, are uncertain just what the plan will be.</p>
        <p>''I'd like him to play all the time,'' General Manager Mike Milbury said. ''That'd be my first preference, but we've got a guy like Vanbiesbrouck here who's going to want minutes, too. I don't want to ascribe some game plan that I don't have. Eventually, this guy is going to be our goaltender if we're right, and I think we are.</p>
        <p>''He's going to be our long-term No. 1 netminder. When is the question.</p>
        <p>''With John, we don't have the urgency, the pressure, to get this kid time here right away. Ask him and he wants to be the starting goaltender on opening night. That's part of the appeal of this kid, that he wants to be under the spotlight, wants to feel the pressure. He likes it, which is a good way to be for a goaltender.''</p>
        <p>The Islanders have put themselves under the microscope with a drastic upheaval this summer and Milbury is well aware that the team's fate may lie in the unlikely hands of DiPietro, along with other young players like 19-year-old Tim Connolly and 20-year-old Mathieu Biron.</p>
        <p>''All the pressure I've felt over the last few years has all gone away as of the draft,'' Milbury said. ''If it works and we fine-tune things, good, then I've done a good job. If it doesn't work, it's time to move on.</p>
