        <p>AN INVISIBLE SIGN OF MY OWN  By Aimee Bender  243 pages. Doubleday. $22.95.</p>
        <p>This is a novel that begins with the word ''so.'' So. It is at once a word, a sentence and a paragraph, followed by a mysterious parable about a kingdom in which nobody dies, so . . . the king demands that someone from every family volunteer to die.</p>
        <p>In other words, Aimee Bender establishes from the outset a tone of casual, offhand intimacy, but the fairy tale-like parable, whose themes are mortality, self-sacrifice and dismemberment, is not so simple. And neither is Ms. Bender's intriguing ''An Invisible Sign of my Own,'' which pursues a course through the charmingly deformed personality of its narrator, evoking as it goes the dark themes of the parable in the first few pages of the book.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bender, whose previous book, ''The Girl in the Flammable Skirt,'' was a collection of slightly screwy young women and their slightly screwy predicaments, offers us a 20-year-old narrator named Mona in this, her first full-length novel. Mona is a math teacher at the grammar school in the small town where she lives, the previous holder of the job having decamped for Paraguay to become a revolutionary. She is somewhat beyond screwy. In fact, Mona is positively psychotic, a kind of platonic representation of a category known to psychologists as young women who fear success.</p>
        <p>Mona is good at a lot of things, but has quit all but one of them. When she feels sexual or romantic attraction, she eats soap, which, as can be imagined, successfully distracts her.  Once, when her running coach -- track stardom is one of the things she has quit -- asks her why she has stopped competing, she answers, ''I quit because winning is lonely.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Bender's purpose is broader than some clinical depiction of a mental disorder. It is to allow the darkness of the human soul to seep through the airiness of appearances, to show a small cast of characters afflicted by terrors unseen to others. In this sense, ''An Invisible Sign of My Own'' is witty and engaging; it is tinged with a kind of gothic horror and it is certainly stylistically nimble. And yet it does not entirely succeed in realizing its purpose, for two reasons: it is too often defeated by the willful childishness of its characters and, more important, it slides to a happy, Hollywood, love-conquers-all sort of ending that is inconsistent with the spiritual darkness of its overall vision.</p>
        <p>The story weaves together several strands in Mona's life. She has been asked by the elementary school's principal to become the math teacher, even though she is very young and has no experience. But math, as Mona puts it, was ''the one thing I loved but never quit.''</p>
        <p>''Mix up some numbers and signs,'' she adds, ''and you get an equation for the way the wind shifts or an axiom for the movement of water, or the height of someone, or for how skin feels.'' Math, in other words, has the controllable orderliness that Mona craves, and being a math teacher would seem to be her perfect job.</p>
        <p>But then the 14 members of Mona's second-grade math class enter the picture; they are an obstreperous and troubled lot, children whose tormented souls mirror Mona's own. Mona asks each pupil to take something to class that represents a number -- she herself takes an ax that she bought at the hardware store on her birthday, and it becomes the number 7. One boy takes a 1 in the form of the severed arm of his father, which has been encased in glass. Another girl makes a zero out of an intravenous feeding tube, since her mother is in the hospital, dying of cancer.</p>
        <p>Just as what Mona calls Numbers and Materials illustrates the deformities in the lives and minds of her pupils, Mona herself is shown to have problems outside of school. Since she was 10 years old, her father has been afflicted with an unidentified and unidentifiable disease, a condition that both angers and worries her. She notices weird behavior around her, especially behavior involving numbers, like that of the school's former math teacher, who now runs a hardware store and wears a number around his neck to indicate his mood. She falls in love with the science teacher at school (who asks his students to act as if they have dread diseases), but when the moment comes for her to demonstrate her love, her primal fear of success takes over and she disappears into the bathroom to eat soap instead.</p>
        <p>Throughout, Ms. Bender treats us to many illustrations of her cleverness with words. ''In the street, two orange cones had tipped over, vivid and isosceles,'' Mona notes at one point. Later, sitting in a movie theater with the science teacher: ''My hands were silent in my lap and I began to cloak the air around myself, heavying it, thickening it with aggression and glamour, red velvet breathing, and I made the air seethe off me, onto him, to make him look over again; I wanted to force him to look over just by the power of my will.''</p>
        <p>But there are also passages of ultra-cuteness that show Ms. Bender losing her grip on her character's own burdened mental world. Mona tells us of some neighbors who moved to Florida after their newborn baby died, and that she used to make detours to the cemetery to visit its grave. ''Hi baby, I said to it, this is your big sister here. I figured it wouldn't know the difference.''</p>
        <p>Everything in Mona's world, all the disparate people and events that she has been keeping track of in her obsessive way, comes together in a shocking incident in school, the exact nature of which it would be unfair to disclose. Let's just say that in it the children act out Mona's own fantasies.</p>
        <p>But strangely, everything just as quickly turns out right, for no particular reason, though with some maneuvering by a sadder and wiser Mona. Ms. Bender's ending has a kind of tacked-on quality, as if she herself is not quite sure where the various afflictions of her characters -- children who don't act like children, and grown-ups who do --  should take them, or as if she herself is terrified by their tragic potential.</p>
        <p>Still, ''An Invisible Sign of My Own'' is an intelligent and engaging work by a recent arrival on the literary scene, with a fanciful and original take on the quietly helter-skelter world that lies within.</p>
