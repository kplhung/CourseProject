        <p>An Air France Concorde carrying mainly German tourists bound for a cruise ship in New York crashed in flames shortly after takeoff from Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris today, killing all 109 passengers and crew members on board as well as at least 4 people on the ground.</p>
        <p>It was the first crash of a Concorde since the world's first supersonic passenger plane went into commercial operation in 1976.</p>
        <p>Witnesses said one or both of the plane's left engines were on fire and smoking heavily even as the aircraft sped down the runway. They said the plane failed to gain altitude, banked heavily to the left and then crashed, demolishing a small hotel and restaurant in Gonesse, a suburb nine miles northeast of Paris.</p>
        <p>Air France identified the passengers on board the chartered flight AF4590 as 96 Germans, 2 Danes, an Austrian and an American. The American was a retired Air France employee, but the company did not release a name. The nine crew members, three pilots and six flight attendants, were French. French government officials said those killed in the hotel included two Polish and one French staff members and one British tourist. Five others were reportedly injured, four of them seriously.</p>
        <p>The two black boxes -- the flight recorder and the cockpit voice recorder -- were located a few hours after the crash and handed to investigating officials, said the head of the French civil aviation authority, Pierre Graf.</p>
        <p>The crash came after cracks were discovered recently in the wings of several aging Concordes. Jean-Cyril Spinetta, the president of Air France, said cracks had been found in four of the airline's six Concordes, but not on the one that crashed today.</p>
        <p>''There are no possible links between the engine and these cracks,'' he told reporters at the scene. He added that this Concorde entered service in 1980 and had undergone a mechanical check-up as recently as last Friday.</p>
        <p>The aircraft had been chartered by a German tour company, Peter Deilmann Reederei G.m.b.H., based in the northern German town of Neustadt. Mr. Deilmann, the company's chief executive, said the Concorde's passengers were scheduled to land at Kennedy International Airport and then board a luxury cruise ship, the Deutschland, this evening in New York at the start of a 16-day tour of the Caribbean, through the Panama Canal, to Manta in Ecuador.</p>
        <p>Within minutes of the crash, which occurred here at 4:44 p.m., airport emergency trucks arrived on the scene to find flames and smoke engulfing both the remains of the plane and the remnants of the hotel, a wooden building called Hotelissimo. Soon afterward, dozens of police vehicles and fire trucks also arrived and the area was cordoned off.</p>
        <p>Two hours later, with planes again leaving Charles de Gaulle airport and flying over the wreckage, firemen were still trying to put out the blaze, which continued to spew thick white smoke across a nearby highway and wheat fields.</p>
        <p>Journalists who reached the area were kept at a distance of some 100 yards, but they could see darkened pieces of the plane's fuselage as well as a solitary wheel and what looked like one of the turbines. Only a tiny section of the 45-room hotel remained standing, albeit charred and ruined. The wreckage of the plane was confined to a small area, little larger than its own size, seemingly confirming eyewitness reports that it fell on its left side and tipped over on its back. The crash and the minutes preceding it were witnessed by a vast number of people, both at the airport and around Gonesse.</p>
        <p>Even now, more than 30 years after the plane was unveiled as the pride of the British and French aviation industries, passengers and airport workers routinely turn their eyes toward the runway to watch the aircraft's swan-like form take to the air, flames shooting out of the afterburners on the jet engines that give it the thrust it needs for supersonic speed. Today was only different because smoke and far more flames than normal were spewing from the aircraft as it took off.</p>
        <p>''It hadn't left the ground and already it was on fire,'' said Sylvie Lucas, who had gone to the airport to pick up her children from another flight. ''The flames were coming from the back of the plane. We were waiting to hear the explosion because we thought it was going to fall here.''</p>
        <p>A photograph of the ill-fated Concorde in the air, taken by a young Hungarian plane-spotter, showed flames stretching some 200 feet behind the aircraft.</p>
        <p>Eric Udel, a New York musician who had just finished touring Europe with the Blue Brothers jazz band, said he looked up and saw the Concorde on fire. ''It looked just like virtual reality,'' he said. ''Of course, we all knew what it was. And there was nothing on earth you could do. It looked like it was trying to ascend, but its nose was down. First there was smoke, then there was fire, then it just went nose in and all that was left was a white billowy cloud.''</p>
        <p>Other witnesses who watched the crippled plane as it flew toward the southeast also anticipated the worst.</p>
        <p>''We saw its rear engine in flames,'' said Samir Hossein, 15, a Gonesse student who was playing tennis nearby. ''We saw it lose altitude; it chopped off those trees near the hotel and headed to the ground. The pilot tried to bank but the plane rolled over and hit the hotel nose first and turned over.''</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who visited the scene some two hours after the disaster, said the plane's pilots apparently had time to signal an emergency because the runways at both Charles de Gaulle and the nearby Le Bourget airports were ordered cleared. ''But the plane could not return, even though it tried,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Willy Corenthin, 29, an electrician who saw the crash as he drove on a nearby highway, said he also heard an explosion while the plane was still in the air. ''I saw smoke and flames coming from the engines, then I heard an explosion and the plane heaved to the left and crashed,'' he said. ''When it fell, it seemed to fall very slowly, then the smoke and flames erupted. I didn't hear another explosion.''</p>
        <p>Although the plane with a full fuel load demolished the small hotel, it narrowly missed an adjacent and larger hotel, Les Relais Bleus. The owner of Les Relais Bleus said he saw the burning plane heading toward him and fled. If it had continued another 300 yards, it would also have crashed into the town of Gonesse, presumably causing many more deaths.</p>
        <p>''If it had fallen on Gonesse, it would have been an unbelievable disaster,'' said Mr. Corenthin, echoing the view of several local residents who felt that the pilot may have been trying to steer the plane away from the town.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure the pilot was trying to avoid more populated areas,'' said Christine Turpin, who saw the flaming plane flash by just 150 feet above her gasoline station. ''I think he was trying to get back to the airport or land in a field.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, the French transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, said he had asked the civil aviation authority to cancel Concorde flights on Wednesday. In London, a spokesman for British Airways, the only airline apart from Air France to fly the plane, said this evening's flights to and from New York had also been canceled. But a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Board in Britain said it had no intention of grounding the Concorde.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, British Airways grounded one of its seven Concordes after cracks were found in its wings, but the remaining six in its supersonic fleet continue to fly.</p>
        <p>Tonight, BAE Systems of Britain and Aerospatiale Matra of France, the successors to the companies that built the aircraft, said they were forming an investigating team. The United States National Transportation Safety Board said it was also sending an investigator to Paris to work with the French government team. Further, experts from Rolls-Royce, the manufacturer of the engines, were on their way to Paris to carry out their own investigation into the apparent failure of one or two of the plane's four Olympus 593 engines.</p>
        <p>President Jacques Chirac of France as well as Mr. Jospin expressed their condolences to the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, who in turn noted that ''Germany and France are united in their horror over the accident, in mourning for the victims and in sympathy for the families.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton also spoke of the crash today. ''Like all of you,'' he told reporters, ''I have just heard the news of the crash of the Concorde outside Paris and I wanted to extend the deepest condolences of the American people to the families of those who are lost.''</p>
        <p>The Concorde, which can fly at 1,350 miles per hour at some 60,000 feet above sea-level, has long been regarded by France as proof of its technological prowess. Even though supersonic travel never caught on widely, it has been a favorite of prosperous businessmen and show business personalities who welcome being able to cross the Atlantic in around half the time -- just three and a half hours -- of regular commercial flights. For the convenience, roundtrip tickets can cost up to $11,000.</p>
        <p>Although the Concorde only makes the return flight to New York three times a day -- once from Paris, twice from London -- its aura of romance and luxury has also made it popular for charter by travel groups catering to the well-heeled.</p>
        <p>Until now, the plane, which was first flown in tests in 1969, has had a good safety record, albeit with sporadic difficulties. In January, two British Airways Concordes made emergency landings within a 24-hour period, one after an engine switched off, the other after a fire alarm went off in the cockpit. On at least three occasions, the rubber tires on Concorde's landing gear have also exploded upon landing. But in these and other incidents, no passenger has ever been injured.</p>
        <p>In the past, Air France has predicted that its fleet of Concordes would continue flying until at least 2007.</p>
