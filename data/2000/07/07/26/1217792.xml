        <p>The Jets have always been someone else's tenants since they began playing 40 seasons ago.

        <p>The Jets made it official yesterday: they have begun the search for a new stadium by setting up a New York office and hiring an expert on sports facilities to find and build a place to play.</p>
        <p>The Jets have always been someone else's tenants since they began playing 40 seasons ago. And in 1984, they moved to Giants Stadium and became the only team in professional sports playing in a park named for another club. Previously, they played in the Polo Grounds and then Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>But when Woody Johnson became the Jets' new owner in January, he said they would be in a new home after the lease in Giants Stadium ends in 2008. To lead its search, the club has hired Jay Cross, who holds an architecture degree from Columbia University and who was instrumental in planning the American Airlines Arena for the Miami Heat. The Miami arena was built with a combination of private and public funding. The owner has said he would consider New York, New Jersey and Westchester for a new stadium.</p>
