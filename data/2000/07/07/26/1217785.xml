        <p>Smaller class size in early grades and access to preschool appear to increase student achievement, particularly in impoverished communities, more than the salaries, education or experience of teachers, a national study released yesterday says.</p>
        <p>The state-by-state analysis of standardized test results suggests that policy initiatives to raise student achievement have been effective, with math scores climbing steadily across the country at an average rate of about one percentile point each year from 1990 to 1996. Texas and a handful of other states that were among the leaders in adopting new standards and accountability systems have shown particular gains, including significantly higher scores by poor students and those from minority groups.</p>
        <p>''Public education is reformable,'' declared David Grissmer, the principal author of the book-length study published by the Rand Corporation, a policy and research group based in Santa Monica, Calif.</p>
        <p>''Five years ago, we were unsure whether reform in the states was working and if spending more money would make any difference in educational outcomes,'' Mr. Grissmer said. ''We see gains in some states from reform efforts, and we see that resources, if they're properly targeted, can be very effective at raising achievement.''</p>
        <p>The study presents a mixed picture for politicians arguing over how to spend education dollars, and, in calling for increased federal spending to reduce disparities among states, is sure to provide fodder for debate in the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Both Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore immediately highlighted the report on their campaign Web sites, with Mr. Bush celebrating the declaration of his state as a national leader and Mr. Gore noting that class-size reduction and universal preschool -- programs praised in the report -- form the centerpiece of his education agenda.</p>
        <p>''I am proud of the results we have achieved in education in Texas,'' Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, said in a statement. ''As president, I will achieve the same results, ensuring that no child is left behind.''</p>
        <p>But William A. Galston, a senior adviser to Mr. Gore, the all-but-named Democratic nominee, pointed out that Mr. Bush did not even become governor until 1995, near the end of the period studied.</p>
        <p>''I'm told, though I'm not a farm boy, that roosters crow when the sun comes up,'' said Mr. Galston, director of the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland. ''I am told by some farmers that some roosters are under the impression that they have caused the sun to rise, but they did not.''</p>
        <p>Beneath the partisan potshots, though, educators and state policy makers found crucial lessons in the report, which links scores on a national standardized test to census data and variables like per-pupil spending and class size for the first time. The study looked at seven math and reading tests administered in 44 states through the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal program that tests samples of 4th, 8th and 12th graders.</p>
        <p>Among the findings were these:</p>
        <p>*There is wide disparity in performance across the states for students from socio-economically similar families. Texas topped the list, with students scoring an average of 11 percentile points higher than their counterparts in last-ranked California. The states succeeding in this measure tended to spend more money per student, have lower student-teacher ratios and less teacher turnover, provide more public prekindergarten classes and have teachers report satisfaction with their classroom resources.</p>
        <p>*Looking at raw scores, states clustered near the top were mostly northern and rural, including Minnesota, Montana and Maine, while the 10 lowest performers were eight Southern states, California and New Mexico. The study's authors attribute this largely to demographics.</p>
        <p>*While math scores increased across the country, there was considerable range in gains among the states. North Carolina students improved nearly 2.5 percentile points each year, and those in Texas and Michigan 2 percentile points, more than twice the national average.</p>
        <p>*Teacher salaries, their years in the classroom and the percentage of the teaching force with master's degrees appear to have little impact on student performance, though Mr. Grissmer said more study of these factors is necessary. The report said education dollars would be better spent on classroom-based resources to improve teacher working conditions, like computers and voice mail and curriculum materials, or on reducing class size than on wages.</p>
        <p>''It's great to see such a sophisticated study confirming a truth too many people want to ignore: poor children achieve at lower rates because we give them an inferior education,'' said Kati Haycock, director of the Education Trust, a Washington group focused on disadvantaged students. ''With targeted investments and high expectations, we can close the achievement gap once and for all.''</p>
        <p>But while most people praised the report's rigor, some questioned the usefulness of analyzing test scores that predate many state reform initiatives, and other aspects of its methodology.</p>
        <p>Tom Loveless, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who is also studying NAEP data, pointed out that the math scores Mr. Grissmer used come from a new test that tracks curriculums introduced widely in the last decade, and that scores on an older form of the exam, which emphasizes basic skills such as arithmetic, have been flat in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers, questioned whether the analysis of teacher pay and experience remains relevant now that the country is facing a teacher shortage.</p>
        <p>And Susan K. Burr, California's interim secretary of education, noted that in the last two years, her state has cut class size in kindergarten to fourth grade from 28 students to 20; increased per pupil spending by nearly $1,000, and instituted an accountability system similar to the one in Texas.</p>
        <p>The report, she said, is ''ancient history.''</p>
