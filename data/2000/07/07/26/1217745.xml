        <p>THE word Sahara may conjure up images of rolling dunes and head-splitting heat, but in Gravesend, Brooklyn, Sahara is an oasis.</p>
        <p>In the summer, this sprawling Turkish restaurant offers a lovely garden in the rear where you can dine like the luckiest of desert dwellers, under trellises thick with grapevines, surrounded by squash and cucumber plants.</p>
        <p>But for urban nomads slogging through a New York summer, Sahara offers something even more useful: a thriving takeout business.</p>
        <p>Those who have lived with intense heat know best that the way to eat is to eliminate complications. Simple food simply prepared is the secret, and at this Sahara excels. A shepherd's salad ($3.50 medium) is no more than cubed tomatoes and cucumbers mixed with onions, black olives and fragrant parsley, but it is impeccably fresh and refreshing.</p>
        <p>Along with a few rounds of puffy pide bread and perhaps some of the sparkling spreads like hummus and baba gannouj ($3 each), or ezme ($3.50), a spicy chopped salad of eggplant, red pepper and other vegetables, it can be a complete meal.</p>
        <p>More substantial dishes include expertly grilled chicken thighs ($8) that have been gently marinated and subtly imbued with smoke, or a richly flavored gyro kebab ($7), sliced thin and grilled until crisp around the edges.</p>
        <p>Tender baby lamb chops ($13.90) and lamb kebabs ($9.90), both served with buttery rice and a selection of grilled vegetables, are also good choices.</p>
        <p>Desserts, like thickly honeyed baklava ($3) and tulumba ($3), small balls of fried dough drenched in syrup, look like standard-issue Middle Eastern sweets.</p>
        <p>For a true treat, Mansoura's Middle Eastern Shop, a kosher Sephardic bakery about 10 blocks from Sahara, sells wonderful, delicate pastries, like semolina cake topped with almonds and subtly flavored with rose water ($10 a pound) or richly flavored apricot-and-pistachio logs ($7 a half pound).</p>
        <p>Sahara, 2337-2343 Coney Island Avenue, near Avenue T, Gravesend, Brooklyn, (718) 376-8594. Delivery: five-mile radius. Mansoura's, 515 Kings Highway, (718) 645-7977.</p>
