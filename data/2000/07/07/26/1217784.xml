        <p>Joseph Galli, it seems, isn't one to mull major career moves for a long time. Just over a year ago, Mr. Galli, a 19-year veteran of Black &amp; Decker, accepted the job as chief executive of Pepsico's Frito-Lay division, then hours later changed his mind to become the president and chief operating officer of Amazon.com instead.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Galli said he would quit Amazon to become president and chief executive of VerticalNet, an Internet company that runs 56 Web sites devoted to specific industries, like Pollution Online. He took the job only a week after meeting Mark Walsh, VerticalNet's current chief executive, over dinner at an industry conference. Mr. Walsh will become chairman of VerticalNet, which is based in Horsham, Pa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galli said that he had been considering leaving Amazon, which is based in Seattle, for some time because his children live with his former wife in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>''I went back most weekends,'' Mr. Galli said, ''and I made a decision this wasn't right.''</p>
        <p>Analysts said that the decision of Mr. Galli was a gain for VerticalNet and a loss for Amazon.</p>
        <p>''Amazon handpicked Joe from a large pool and there has to be a sting with him leaving,'' said Derek Brown, an analyst with WR Hambrecht &amp; Company. Amazon's shares fell $1.125, to $37.625, yesterday.</p>
        <p>Amazon, which lost $720 million last year, has been under a great deal of scrutiny by investors in recent months as some analysts questioned whether it could afford to pay for its rapid expansion from simply selling books to offering everything from paring knives to lawn chairs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galli said his departure had nothing to do with any disillusionment with Amazon.</p>
        <p>''I love Amazon.com and I think that the company has enormous potential,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Jeff Bezos, the chairman and chief executive of Amazon, said Mr. Galli's departure was amicable.</p>
        <p>''I was his reference yesterday with VerticalNet,'' Mr. Bezos said. ''I would have loved to keep Joe around, he has helped us tremendously, but this is the right thing for him to do.''</p>
        <p>At Amazon, his most visible accomplishment was guiding the entry into the tool and home improvement business, a business line that has yet to prove successful. Mr. Bezos credited Mr. Galli with recruiting talented mid-level managers.</p>
        <p>Internet executives who know both Mr. Bezos and Mr. Galli wondered, however, how well the two driven and forceful men worked together. Mr. Galli was hired to bring order to Amazon's sprawling operations, yet Mr. Bezos himself has a history of being a hands-on manager.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galli said he worked well with Mr. Bezos.</p>
        <p>Amazon said that it was not looking for a replacement for Mr. Galli, and that Mr. Bezos would assume the additional title of president, and the eight executives who had reported to Mr. Galli would report to him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galli may well find the job at VerticalNet to be more financially rewarding, given the drop in Amazon.com's stock. When he joined, Mr. Galli was granted options to purchase nearly four million Amazon shares over 20 years, at a price of $57.95, some 80 percent above where the shares trade today.</p>
        <p>Unlike most Internet executives, Mr. Galli received substantial cash compensation in addition to his stock options: an initial signing bonus of $100,000, a $200,000-a-year salary, and an additional bonus of $3 million for the first year, $3 million for the second year, and $2 million the third year, all payable at the beginning of the year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galli just received the second $3 million installment on June 24. According to Amazon documents, Mr. Galli's contract says that if he leaves Amazon before the end of the year, he must return the share of that year's bonus that reflects the number of days he did not work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galli and Mr. Walsh declined to specify Mr. Galli's compensation at VerticalNet. Mr. Walsh did say, however, that it resembled that at  most Internet companies in that it was mainly in stock rather than cash.</p>
        <p>''If VerticalNet hits on all cylinders, then Joe Galli will be one happy cat,'' Mr. Walsh said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galli was drawn to VerticalNet through a series of contacts. Several months ago he met Kenneth Fox, the managing director of the Internet Capital Group, one of VerticalNet's main backers, through a dinner arranged by Mr. Fox's father, a construction executive who had done business with Mr. Galli at Black &amp; Decker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox was interested in recruiting Mr. Galli and arranged the dinner with Mr. Walsh last week. There the two executives discovered that Mr. Walsh's father was an advertising executive who worked on the Black &amp; Decker account.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walsh said that he and Mr. Galli hit it off right away.</p>
        <p>''He was a down-to-earth guy who wanted to come back to the East Coast,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''We weren't looking for a C.E.O. But I said let's make room on the bench.''</p>
