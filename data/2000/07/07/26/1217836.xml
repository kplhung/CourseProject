        <p>Last month at Bronxville High School in Westchester, the school's 82  seniors discussed year-end celebrations and college plans and promised to write heartfelt messages in one another's yearbooks.</p>
        <p>But when the books were handed out during graduation week, seniors found lewd, prankish photographs, off-color jokes and remarks insulting some students. In one picture, two male students simulated a sex act; in another, a student exposed his buttocks.</p>
        <p>''Within 10 minutes, three or four girls walked into the principal's office and said, 'Oh God, look what they did to me -- I can't show this to my mother,' '' said Jeffrey Zuckerman, president of the Bronxville Teachers Association.</p>
        <p>Other elements had a self-mocking tone about Bronxville. One page was titled ''You know you're from Westchester if. . . .'' It poked fun at the way residents of this exclusive, mostly white suburb dealt with racial and social issues, filling in the blank with inscriptions like ''You recall your Jamaican nanny with great fondness'' and ''Your parents supplied the alcohol for the last big party.''</p>
        <p>The yearbook got more attention in the local newspapers and cable television news channel than the news in February that Bronxville had been ranked by Newsweek as the nation's fifth-best high school.</p>
        <p>Yearbook makers say off-color, offensive or caustic items in yearbooks are increasing across the country. Far more troubling, they say, have been incidents of racism, often involving hidden messages created when several students agree on what to place under their individual photographs.</p>
        <p>But while concern over those practices is rising, there is also a growing sense that the role of yearbooks has shifted. Many are no longer displays of self-congratulation but something closer to journalism: an attempt to reflect student reality. Increasingly, faculty advisers are struggling over how much leeway to permit.</p>
        <p>''These books are a precious moment for people to express themselves,'' said Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. ''You don't want to start young people out believing that the faculty or principal can censor them because they think it's too controversial. What kind of lesson are you teaching students who just learned in civics class about free speech, censoring their statements in their own yearbook?''</p>
        <p>Last month, at Hillcrest High School in Queens, a school with a diverse ethnic student body, a female student chose an inscription to accompany her photo saying that she would fight and die for the spread of Islam. It was discovered before the yearbook was printed and engendered protests from the local Jewish community. The school's principal decided, after consulting with lawyers from New York City's Board of Education, to allow the inscription to be printed.</p>
        <p>Yearbook sales representatives warn yearbook committees to watch for surreptitious submissions, said Michael Bailey, a senior vice president for Jostens, the country's largest producer of high school yearbooks.</p>
        <p>''Every year, kids get more creative and sophisticated with the different things they come up with,'' he said. The school is responsible for the content of the book, he added, but Jostens asks its production staff to watch for off-color comments.</p>
        <p>''They're typically pranks, often a joke in a picture caption, or the timeless middle finger,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''Students like to challenge what they can slip through the system. There's always new lingo or a new signal or put-down in the senior personals.''</p>
        <p>Mark Goodman, executive director of the Student Press Law Center in Arlington, Va., said that more and more yearbook committees had  stopped accepting personal statements from students. ''They realize they don't have the ability to control them,'' he said, ''and if they don't catch something and it's printed, they have a real mess on their hands.''</p>
        <p>In 1995 at Greenwich High School in Connecticut, a phrase urging the killing of blacks was discovered, in code form, in the photograph captions for five senior boys. The incident caused outrage in Greenwich, one of the wealthiest communities in the nation.</p>
        <p>The five students were suspended  and barred from commencement. They agreed to spend the summer taking racial sensitivity classes.</p>
        <p>Some students see their yearbook as a way to fire a parting shot before graduating, said Dr. Rachel M. Lauer, a professor of psychology at the Manhattan campus of Pace University and a former chief psychologist for New York City schools.</p>
        <p>''They do it out of rebellion and hostility, and because they feel they've been hostage for years, totally controlled by teachers and other adults and have no say,'' she said. ''It's a revenge thing, a last slap, as if to say 'This is what we're doing and you can't stop it because it's already in print.' ''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lauer added: ''These books are often full of big shots and their achievements, and they sneak in these messages as an expression of scorn at the hypocrisy they see. They're angry at this book, which is meant to be this diamond showing 'how wonderful we were' and they feel things were anything but wonderful. They know all the stories behind it, and they're just going to show it up.''</p>
        <p>By law, student expression may be restricted in yearbooks and newspapers, according to a 1988 United States Supreme Court decision, Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier. The court said a school could censor material it deemed inconsistent with its educational mission, because the publication bears the imprimatur of the school.</p>
        <p>Legal standards for student yearbooks are the same as for student newspapers, said Mr. Goodman, of the Student Press Law Center.</p>
        <p>''The school can't completely silence viewpoints they disagree with, but they can still engage in a fair amount of censorship,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, school administrators have insisted upon reviewing yearbook content, often because faculty advisers are frequently rookie teachers with little journalistic training.</p>
        <p>But more and more schools are training yearbook committees in journalism, he said. Once style guidelines are established, jurisdiction is basically turned over to students to make editorial decisions by committee after consulting with faculty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman added, ''Once they give students the authority to make their own content decisions, school officials are very limited in censoring material.''</p>
        <p>He said he believed this was all to the good.</p>
        <p>''For many years yearbooks were regarded as nothing but public relations devices for the schools, but over the past 10 years, there is a growing recognition that it is journalism,'' said Mr. Goodman, who added that most of the top yearbooks in scholastic competitions have agreements empowering students. They are also less likely to be sabotaged.</p>
        <p>''If students take ownership and responsibility for it, to produce a book without sense of obligation, they can cover the year that was, the good and the bad. Then the book reflects their world, not just the world the school officials want to present.''</p>
