        <p>In the wake of the collapse of the Camp David peace talks there will be a great temptation to pronounce the Israeli-Palestinian peace process over. That would be a great, great mistake. The truth is, it has just begun.</p>
        <p>President Clinton accomplished something very important at Camp David -- and hats off to him for having the courage to try. He brought the issues of Jerusalem, refugees and real territorial compromise down from the heavens -- down from the airy mantras and dreamlands where they have resided for 33 years -- onto the negotiating table. As one Palestinian negotiator remarked to the Americans just before the Camp David talks broke up: ''This was revolutionary.''</p>
        <p>And he was right. In their talks, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel offered the Palestinians a real state in virtually all of the West Bank and Gaza; he put forward a credible solution for the Palestinian refugee issue; he offered Yasir Arafat a mosaic of Palestinian administrative control and sovereignty over the Arab areas of Jerusalem and Muslim holy sites. Mr. Arafat offered Israel security arrangements that were unprecedented; he proposed adjusting the 1967 borders to accommodate some Israeli settlements in the West Bank; and he was ready to cede Palestinian sovereignty over Jewish areas in the Old City of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Folks, none of these issues have been broached between these parties before. Oh, op-ed writers broached them aplenty; think tanks broached them aplenty. But the leaders never did. These were all taboo issues, and breaking those taboos is a legacy Mr. Clinton can be proud of, because it was the necessary condition for solving these issues.</p>
        <p>Both sides have been carrying around their positions on Jerusalem, refugees and territory in a sealed box. At Camp David the seals were opened, the issues were laid out and prospective trades were made. And there were plenty of Palestinian negotiators at Camp David who were urging Mr. Arafat to take the package on the table, and plenty of Israelis ready to back Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately Mr. Arafat, in the end, could not pull the trigger and take what Mr. Barak was offering -- an offer the U.S. side felt went a long way toward meeting Palestinian needs. This isn't surprising. There is probably no way Mr. Arafat could cede any degree of Arab sovereignty over East Jerusalem and the holy sites on the Temple Mount without an Arab-Muslim consensus -- that is, without the approval of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan and Morocco. And he did not have that green light.</p>
        <p>At one point, President Clinton told Mr. Arafat that he was sacrificing the future of his people for the approval of Arab countries and Palestinian radicals who would sell him down the river in a second. Mr. Arafat told Mr. Clinton he knew that. But he still couldn't pull the trigger -- a sad reminder that the Palestinians don't not have a state for nothing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat is going to have to decide whether his loyalty is to the Palestinian cause or the Palestinian people. If his loyalty is to the Palestinian cause, he has left Camp David as a hero, and he will no doubt receive high-fives all around the Arab world. If his loyalty is to the Palestinian people, well, that's another matter.</p>
        <p>''The Arabs and the Palestinian opponents of peace have always been able to get the benefit of Arafat's compromises without taking any political or moral responsibility,'' noted the Middle East expert Stephen P. Cohen. ''The Arab states got a reduction in the threat from Israel, but without ever paying the price of saying to their people that we have truly passed to a new era. And the Palestinian intelligentsia got land back, but they never had to get their hands dirty. This never stopped Arafat before. But this time, at Camp David, he has decided to do it their way -- putting dogma before pragmatism.</p>
        <p>''The only way to get around this,'' added Mr. Cohen, ''is for Clinton to call the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Syria and say, 'Guys, put up or shut up. There is no more free ride here. Either you guys share the responsibility with Arafat -- and admit you are sharing Jerusalem with the Jews, who are also at home there -- or you are leaving the Palestinians at the mercy of the Israeli right, because Barak either won't be around or he will be around saying that the Palestinians are hopeless.' ''</p>
        <p>There is already tough talk coming from Palestinian radicals about how they are going to declare their own state on Sept. 13, or mount another intifada. Guys, here's some free advice: The days of the intifada are over. The Palestinian police now have guns -- and that changes everything.</p>
        <p>''The intifada worked for the Palestinians,'' observed the Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi, ''because they had stones and the Israelis had guns and the Israelis could not really shoot back, they could not use their superior force without restraint. If the Palestinians use guns, there is no intifada option anymore. This won't be defined as a people's movement with stones against an army with guns. It will be defined as a war between two armies, and Israel will use all its force without restraint.''</p>
        <p>The last time the Palestinians used guns against Israeli guns was in a place called Lebanon, and it ended with the P.L.O. on a boat to Tunis.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile in Israel, one can already hear the yapping on the political right: Ariel Sharon and Natan Sharansky blathering on about how they could get more for Israel and give up less. They speak utter nonsense. The important thing about what President Clinton did in singling out Mr. Barak as having been willing to compromise, to a degree that Mr. Arafat was not, was to signal that there is in the U.S. view a level of Israeli compromise that is right and fair, and beyond which Israel should not be expected to go. It is not just a bottomless pit of giveaways.</p>
        <p>There will be a big push in Israel now to form a national unity government, but thanks to Camp David it is going to be a very different debate. Because the question will be on what basis national unity will be forged. On the basis of the compromises Mr. Barak tabled at Camp David, or on the basis of the Israeli right's delusion that by just hanging tough with unrealistic positions the Palestinian side will fold -- and there will be no price with America, the Arabs or the rest of the world?</p>
        <p>The first Mideast peace talks at Camp David, in 1978, brought the Arab world over the threshold of acknowledging that Israel was there to stay, and it brought Israel over the threshold that endless war was not inevitable. Camp David II has brought Israelis and Palestinians up to a similar threshold, but not over it. It has been clarifying nonetheless, because both sides now can see clearly what their options are: Going forward means accepting the full implications of sharing the land of Israel-Palestine and Jerusalem. Going backward means a life on the barricades in which the future of both peoples is completely uncertain. Most of all, neither side can ever again return to the bliss of thinking that it doesn't have a real choice.</p>
