        <p>In the house where I grew up in Brooklyn, food was a religion. Christmas dinner would last four hours. You'd have the appetizer, talk about it, have another course, talk some more. You were aware of not just what went into the meal, but what the textures were supposed to be like, why one dish was better than another.</p>
        <p>I graduated with a degree in chemistry, then took a job at General Foods, now Kraft Foods, in the sensory-product evaluation group. I worked on Jell-O, Minute Rice, Cool Whip. Finally I was trained to be a coffee taster. Just to be asked to do that is a big deal. Wine and fine fragrances are the most difficult things to evaluate; then come coffee and chocolate.</p>

        <p>In the house where I grew up in Brooklyn, food was a religion. Christmas dinner would last four hours. You'd have the appetizer, talk about it, have another course, talk some more. You were aware of not just what went into the meal, but what the textures were supposed to be like, why one dish was better than another.</p>
        <p>I graduated with a degree in chemistry, then took a job at General Foods, now Kraft Foods, in the sensory-product evaluation group. I worked on Jell-O, Minute Rice, Cool Whip. Finally I was trained to be a coffee taster. Just to be asked to do that is a big deal. Wine and fine fragrances are the most difficult things to evaluate; then come coffee and chocolate.</p>
        <p>The first time I ever tasted at General Foods, the group leader said: ''Here are three samples of Jell-O. We think there might be a problem with one.'' They all tasted like red Jell-O to me. I looked up, and everyone was writing furiously. I thought: this must be a hazing. They finished and started to talk about ethyl maltol. I thought, ''Ethel who?'' Ethyl maltol is the chemical flavor in strawberry cotton candy. It's very sweet. Every other person in the group said the second sample tasted like wet wool, wet sweater, wet dog, wet fur. The reason was that the second sample was made with gelatin that wasn't clean; it had an animal-fur note. I was so depressed. I couldn't detect defective gelatin, and I thought my career was over. I tell people this story when they're starting out in the field, just to say: ''Hang in there. You'll get it.''</p>
        <p>When you evaluate food, you pay attention to what you feel on the tongue -- bitterness, sourness, sweetness, saltiness. There are also chemical feelings -- cooling, metallic, astringent, nasal pungency (like horseradish). Smell is the hardest. When I train people, I have them smell vials of chemicals or flavors -- orange, mint, cinnamon, oregano, clove, strawberry. If I'm tasting coffee, for instance, in the nose I might perceive fruity or winy, the roasted character, whether it's nutty or woody -- those are the positive notes. Negative notes would be cereal (caused by the inferior robusta bean), rubbery, burnt.</p>
        <p>I've been doing this for 35 years, and I never get bored. It's a sensory jolt every day. Tasting or smelling is like anthropology or archaeology. You're watching to see what unfolds in a product, discovering new things. But there is a limit to how much tasting you can do. I could probably taste 10 coffees in an hour, but only 3 salsas and one toothpaste. In a week I probably do about 10 to 15 hours of evaluation.</p>
        <p>There are about 300 professional tasters in the United States, and we consider it unprofessional not to evaluate something just because you don't like it. I hate cinnamon -- as a child, I got sick on cinnamon candy -- but I can taste it. I don't like sea slugs; they're chewy and slimy. But every time I go to Japan, I try them.</p>
        <p>Because I'm so critical about food, people don't want to invite me home for dinner. I just tell them to roast a chicken and steam some vegetables, and I'll be happy.</p>
