        <p>SUMMERS used to be -- he groused in an indeterminate American accent -- for sitting on the front porch and listening to Chuck Thompson or Harry Caray, night games, day games, doubleheaders on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, halfway through the summer, the five best sporting events of last weekend all had a decidedly foreign edge to them.</p>
        <p>Over in Scotland, there was Tiger Woods turning a legendary golf course into pitch-and-putt.</p>
        <p>Over in France, there was Lance Armstrong pedaling up the Champs-Elysees as casually as my riding my old Schwinn down to buy the papers in the morning. Easier, actually, because Lance did not have to dodge frenzied yuppies barely able to control their SUV's while babbling distractedly on their cell phones.</p>
        <p>Yet the interesting part about this international weekend was that it was not one of those canned Olympic programs in which every medalist was a Yank. Over in Spain, there was John McEnroe, rendered nearly speechless, if you can imagine that, by a bagel job (a shutout, in tennis colloquialism) in the Davis Cup.</p>
        <p>And down in Costa Rica, there was a Jamaican soccer referee, auditioning to be a Don King factotum or maybe a figure-skating judge, dreaming up a penalty that would cost the United States the game.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in Sacramento, two of the greatest sprinters, Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene, went down in a grotesque daily double. (Yes, yes, I know, technically, the trials were held in California, but essentially track and field does not exist in the United States until every Summer Games, so I'm counting this event as foreign.)</p>
        <p>All this hands-across-the-sea exotica tends to cut into the baseball that used to sustain us in these lazy, hazy days.</p>
        <p>The most exciting event of the weekend was Barry Larkin of the Reds whipsawing two slick young general managers, Jim Bowden and Steve Phillips, by bleating that he did not want to be a migrant laborer in New York and promoting a three-year contract from Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>Now the Reds are threatening to raise ticket prices while the season is in progress, just to teach the fans a lesson for siding with Larkin. What a wholesome concept for baseball: a loyalty tax.</p>
        <p>Things seem far less odious from a distance. One thing you can say about Woods and Armstrong: nothing about their triumphs even vaguely smacks of hype.</p>
        <p>Woods flicked the hard Scottish countryside into submission, demolishing every cliche and bad joke about golf. Then there are the commercials that show Woods tapping the ball with his club and blasting one into the stratosphere. Maybe this could be parlayed into X-golf, taken over by Vince McMahon, no more tee shots but golfers facing live pitching. From Roger Clemens. NBC would love it.</p>
        <p>As for Armstrong, he deserves all the praise he gets not only because he is a recovering cancer patient, but also because he dominated the television by pedaling around one of the most diverse and beautiful countries in the world.</p>
        <p>Having covered a couple of Tours, I can remember how the weary riders would receive 45-minute massages, like inert hunks of meat, just so they could hobble off to supper and bed and somehow get back on their machines the next morning. Spectators lined the road, inevitably bearing wine and food, and on the steepest inclines everybody slyly gave a slight push to the riders, and the judges never noticed.</p>
        <p>Arbitrary discretion is far preferable to the overt incompetence (at best) displayed by the soccer referee, who called a hand ball on Gregg Berhalter despite the rather basic evidence of a left hand and a right hand dangling at Berhalter's two sides.</p>
        <p>Truancy rather than chicanery was the theme in Spain. The absence of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi in Davis Cup tennis is contrasted to nations like Sweden and Spain, where the best players display national pride. Next time Mac should listen to his freaky demons, and pencil himself in at doubles.</p>
        <p>As for track and field, the shock of two great runners both going down was a bizarre way to call attention to the quadrennial Olympic jubilee coming soon. With Sydney being 15 hours ahead of New York, NBC is opting for canned events at prime time in the United States.</p>
        <p>The network may be right, but the fact is that the Mets and the Cubs recently came on at dawn from Japan. Soccer buffs in San Francisco rise in the dark to watch Lazio. I got up at 6 a.m. in Seattle to watch the Wimbledon finals. The joke was on me: it was raining in London.</p>
        <p>The world grows smaller and busier. What with the boom in cable and Internet, the old front porch is now wired.</p>
