        <p>Though he left in 1959, when he was 5, Thomas Grover Masters can recall vivid details of his childhood in Korea: The rationed powdered milk he used to eat because it was sweetened. The three nights he spent sleeping next to his mother's body when, unable to care for her three children alone, she poisoned herself. The yellow beret his uncle gave him when he was sent to the orphanage in the mountains.</p>
        <p>After he was adopted and brought to America, some of his memories were edged out by new experiences: Catholic school and the track team, bacon and eggs. His name, Suh Ung Ki, became Tommy; his new sister, a Korean girl his age who was adopted at the same time, was called Mary Jane. English words blotted out Korean. He forgot the names of his biological brother and sister. He even forgot, almost, that he was Korean at all.</p>
        <p>As Tommy and Mary Jane grew up in Wichita, Kan., their parents had no map to navigate the psychological journey from there to here; they did not know a word of the language their new children spoke. They were advised that it was best to help Tommy and Mary Jane forget the shell-shattered world they had left behind.</p>
        <p>Today, international adoptions are nothing like what Mr. Masters experienced. Would-be parents are screened for cultural sensitivity. They join adoption support groups. Children go to culture camps, language lessons, and play groups for adopted kids. At a conference in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., last weekend organized by a group for adopted Koreans and their families, race was the most prominent topic for the 400 families attending.</p>
        <p>As children learned Korean-style brush painting in one part of the Hasbrouck Heights Hilton on Saturday, Mr. Masters advised parents on the importance of learning about their children's native culture.</p>
        <p>''Parents need to realize that to the children, adoption is also a sense of loss,'' he explained. ''Loss of their roots, parts of their personal identity, their biological parents.</p>
        <p>''For the most part, the children don't even realize that they have lost this part of themselves until much later.''</p>
        <p>It is a speech Mr. Masters, 46, is making more and more often, at all kinds of adoption-related gatherings, not just those focused on Korea. He also helped found Also Known As, a New York group of about 300 younger adults, adopted themselves, who now serve as mentors to adopted children. Koreans his age have been the first to speak about growing up unprepared to face a world that perceived them as Asian when they saw themselves as white.</p>
        <p>''One thing that Korean adoptees have taught the rest of the adoption community is that absence does not take away the importance of culture,'' said Margie Perscheid, an adoptive parent from Washington who helped organize the weekend conference. ''These adult adoptees can tell the adoption professionals who thought they knew it all that they were wrong.''</p>
        <p>While adoption professionals note that only a small fraction of the thousands of adoptive families in the United States participate in cultural awareness events and support groups, they say more and more parents are seeking guidance on how to handle the issue of race in their families.</p>
        <p>Guy and Tina Lindgren came to the conference from the predominantly white town of Conway, Ark., hoping to get pointers from other adoptive parents on bringing up their adopted son, Andrew, 22 months. ''Andrew is not your average Arkansan, and pretty soon he's going to know that,'' Mr. Lindgren said.</p>
        <p>The Lindgrens said they read about Korea regularly, and plan to take Andrew there when he is 4 or 5 to visit his old foster  parents. The family, including Andrew, is learning Korean from a Korean student attending a nearby college.</p>
        <p>In the 1950's, adopting foreign children was so unusual that local newspapers often covered the event. Many older adoptees growing up in small towns never saw another Asian, much less another adopted Korean.</p>
        <p>Although scattered international adoptions took place after World War II, families in which the children looked markedly different from the parents began to appear after the Korean War. Harry Holt, a deeply religious Oregon farmer, and his wife, Bertha, decided that the Lord intended for them to save Korean war orphans who had been fathered, and then deserted, by American G.I.'s.</p>
        <p>At the time, American law prevented couples from adopting more than two foreign children. The Holts, who had already reared seven biological children, persuaded Congress to lift the cap so they could adopt eight. In October 1955, magazines and newspapers carried images of Mr. Holt and three flight attendants disembarking from an airplane, babies under each arm.</p>
        <p>They were named Christine, Bobby, Helen, Joseph, Mary, Nathaniel, Paul and Betty.</p>
        <p>Determined to find homes for hundreds more Korean children, the Holts started an agency, Holt International Children's Services. From 1955 to 1960, 3,500 Korean children were adopted by American and European families.</p>
        <p>While nowadays, more children are adopted each year from Russia and China, South Korea's system remains the model for international adoptions, and there are more than 100,000 adopted Koreans in the United States. Last year, about 16,000 children were adopted from overseas, 2,000 from South Korea.</p>
        <p>When the Holts began their work, adoption was tinged with missionary zeal. But that attitude, too, has changed.</p>
        <p>Today, ''children are looked at as gifts to the parents, whereas back then the parents were looked at as the gift to the child,'' said Dottie Enrico, a 41-year-old New York journalist and adopted Korean who grew up in Indiana. ''We had to be loyal, we had to be grateful.''</p>
        <p>In the 1960's, Mr. Masters regularly fought with other children because he looked different, and his sister was taunted at school. But he was proud when Mary Jane, as the only ''exotic'' beauty on the local modeling agency's roster, was hired to dress up as a Native American and hand out cigars, and to sit on the lap of Wichita's mayor as he rode in a rickshaw for Chinese New Year.</p>
        <p>''As far as I was concerned, Korea, Japan, China -- those areas were all the same,'' Mr. Masters, 46, said in an interview in his apartment in East Brunswick, N.J. After college, Mr. Masters worked as a Wichita police officer, then went to law school and became an agent at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. His sister, Mary Jane Brooks, now works as a nanny in Niceville, Fla.</p>
        <p>In 1983, shortly after Mr. Masters was hired, the F.B.I. sent him to Las Vegas, where he was invited to a Korean Lions Club dinner. There, he said, he encountered a roomful of Koreans for the first time since leaving his native country.</p>
        <p>''It completely destroyed all the stereotypes that I ever had of Asians,'' he said, remembering his shock at seeing his hosts drain tumblers of bourbon when he had been told that Asians were unable to handle alcohol -- a myth he believed even after he began drinking himself. The experience prompted him to learn more about his roots.</p>
        <p>For other adopted adults, curiosity about the past was kindled in different ways.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Hotaling, a 45-year-old computer operator in Albany, was so distant from her ethnic origins that her white American husband, who had been stationed in Korea,  introduced her to Korean food. But she wanted to know more when her 8-year-old daughter, Caitlin, began to correct people who mistook her for Chinese, telling them she was Korean-American.</p>
        <p>''I want to be able to teach her what that means, whatever the difference is,'' Mrs. Hotaling said. ''I don't really know if there's that much of a difference.''</p>
        <p>And Ms. Enrico's interest was heightened as she recognized how she appeared to others. ''If people were going to see me as Asian,'' she said, ''it became really clear to me that I owed it to myself to know what that meant. It was something that belonged to me that I missed having.'' Her first visit to Korea in 1997 led her to adopt a Korean child, Eleanor, now nearly 2.</p>
        <p>The journey back to Korea, whether metaphorical or actual, can be rough. In Korean society, adoptees are seen as victims of  misfortune, and adoptees say Koreans there and here sometimes reject them for being too Western or for not speaking better Korean.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, some adoptees think adoptive parents can approach the job of educating their children with too much zeal. Hollee McGinnis, 28, who founded Also Known As with Mr. Masters's help, said some parents clung to their children's ethnic identity as if it were their own, or treated their forays into Asian culture as an exotic adventure. She cautioned against forcing culture camps and language lessons on a reluctant child. She said she was glad that her parents had not talked openly about her ''Koreanness.''</p>
        <p>''I spent half my life not having to think about being Asian,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But adoptive parents say they want to give their children the tools to deal with who they are in a complex cultural landscape. ''Many adoptive families really do consider themselves to be the harbingers of a new way of looking at race,'' said Ms. Perscheid, the conference organizer.</p>
        <p>But people like Mr. Masters and Ms. Enrico are not so sure. They said that, all else being equal, it would be less traumatic for children if they could find homes in their own countries.</p>
        <p>At the same time, both were also quick to say that adoption gave them a better life than they would have if they had remained in Korea.</p>
        <p>''I probably would be cleaning up the streets,'' said Mr. Masters, now a new-media and international-trade consultant.</p>
        <p>''But,'' he added, ''it would have added so much more quality to my life, knowing that we weren't alone.''</p>
