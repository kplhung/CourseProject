        <p>The shaken owner of a German luxury tour operator appeared on national television today to confirm that his company had chartered the Concorde that crashed near Paris, killing 109 people on board and 4 on the ground.</p>
        <p>Many of those who died had paid thousands of dollars to be whisked to New York and a waiting cruise ship.</p>
        <p>Peter Deilmann of Peter Deilmann Reederei G.m.b.H. also expressed the dismay of many Germans who are about to begin their own vacations in August.</p>
        <p>''The news was relayed by telephone to me by Air France and it came as a bombshell,'' Mr. Deilmann said. ''We are in a state of deep shock. I can tell you that 99 passengers booked their passage on the aircraft through my company.'' Almost all were Germans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deilmann, whose company is based in the Baltic port of Neustadt, about 50 miles outside Hamburg, said the passengers came from many regions of Germany. The Foreign Ministry said the single largest group -- 39 -- was from Germany's biggest state, North Rhine-Westphalia.</p>
        <p>There were 96 German victims, whom the ministry declined to identify until the families were notified. Most of the passengers traveled from Frankfurt to Paris before boarding the Concorde.</p>
        <p>Air France said there were 100 passengers on board -- a figure that apparently included the 99 passengers mentioned by Mr. Deilmann and the lone American on board, who has also not been identified. Christopher Korenke, an Air France vice president, told reporters at Kennedy International Airport in New York that the American was a retired Air France employee.</p>
        <p>Three of the passengers were children, the ministry said. The cruise was to have gone through the Caribbean to a final destination of Manta in Ecuador, with an option to sail on as far as Sydney, Australia, and the Summer Olympics.</p>
        <p>The passengers on the Concorde had paid between $4,200 and $11,000 for a cruise that was to begin in New York on a luxury ocean liner, the Deutschland.</p>
        <p>That ship, two two years old, was built in a Roaring 20's style, with  chandeliers, a ballroom, a palm-filled winter garden and a salt-water swimming pool.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Gerhard Schroder expressed his condolences to the victims' families and canceled plans to see a performance of Goethe's ''Faust'' at the Expo 2000 world fair in Hanover. The German cabinet, headed by Mr. Schroder, said it would attend an ecumenical service for victims of the crash Wednesday at a chapel on the Expo grounds.</p>
        <p>Germany immediately indicated that it intended to play a central role in the investigation of the crash, dispatching the transport minister, Reinhard Klimmt, to Paris and announcing that the federal agency that investigates air crashes would begin an inquiry.</p>
        <p>The news punctured a generally upbeat mood in Germany as the chancellor prepared to go on vacation. A strong economy and the passage through Parliament of the largest tax cuts in Germany for many years have bolstered optimism and increased Mr. Schroder's popularity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deilmann said this was the fourth time that his company had offered a Concorde-cruise package -- and would be the last. But the cruise, which had 510 passengers booked, would not be canceled.</p>
        <p>''There's no sense letting the ship lie there,'' he said. ''Life goes on.''</p>
        <p>In New York, some passengers felt differently.</p>
        <p>Gitta Schoneberg, 47, and her 48-year-old husband, Willi, were among the hundreds of passengers who had boarded the Deutschland in Germany and sailed into New York on Monday night.</p>
        <p>''It will be a sad voyage for us,'' Mrs. Schoneberg said. ''Whenever we look over at an empty seat, we will think of this tragedy.''</p>
        <p>''It's better to end the cruise here,'' said her husband. He said this was the most luxurious of the 25 cruises that he and his wife -- both teachers -- had taken since 1990. ''I would ask the captain not to go on. We're not in the mood for a party.''</p>
