        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel flew home from the Camp David summit tonight to a murky political future, his patchwork coalition in tatters, his country sharply divided over the new discussion of ceding parts of Jerusalem to some form of Palestinian control.</p>
        <p>As news spread that the Camp David summit had ended without agreement, the airwaves were filled with the speculation of experts and politicians. Would there be a national unity government, bringing in Mr. Barak's right-wing  Likud critics, new elections or violence from the Palestinians?</p>
        <p>The entire country seemed to tune in to Mr. Barak's Washington press conference. Peppered with questions from Israeli journalists, the Prime Minister himself made light of the uncertainty.</p>
        <p>''At least let me get on the plane and we'll think on the way,'' he joked. ''We will even consult with our journalist friends on the plane.''</p>
        <p>Then, more seriously, he added ''There is no doubt that all of the options are open. We will have to consider the issues seriously and assess the situation. We are at the end of a very important chapter.</p>
        <p>''Neither the discussions at the summit nor the public debate in Israel were marginal issues. We will deliberate on arriving in Israel what is the right thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, who has been in office only a year, lost his majority in the 120-seat Israeli Parliament on the eve of the Camp David meeting, when two Orthodox religious parties -- Shas, which represents Sephardic Jews, and the National Religious Party -- along with former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky's right-leaning party of recent Russian immigrants, quit to protest the peace talks.</p>
        <p>The grim picture is further complicated by a vote scheduled on Aug. 2 -- the last day before the Parliament leaves for a three-month vacation -- to dissolve the legislature and hold new elections.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Barak may actually be returning in a good position, said Sever Plotzker, a political commentator at the newspaper Yediot Ahronoth, which has been polling extensively in the last few days.</p>
        <p>''Altogether, he is coming home in a very special situation,'' Mr. Plotzker said in a telephone interview. ''He has no government, a weak coalition. But in my personal opinion he is stronger in the past few weeks and after Camp David. All our polls show this. He is coming back stronger. The economy is good, and people are seeing progress toward peace. He is sticking to his agenda.''</p>
        <p>The prime minister's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, told Israeli reporters that ''as soon as he returns, Barak will be busying himself with the composition of the government.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak's One Israel parliamentary faction began maneuvering this afternoon to kill the bill, sponsored by two Likud members, that called for elections. The plan was to have the bill referred to the House Committee, headed by Slah Tarif of One Israel. The committee could vote to reverse a previous ruling that the departure of the three parties constituted a ''significant change'' in the political situation.</p>
        <p>A similar bill was defeated a few weeks ago, and under Knesset rules another dissolution bill cannot be considered for six months unless there is a significant change. Thus, Mr. Barak's supporters could gain themselves three months while Parliament is on vacation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak's problems are largely the result of e electoral changes made in 1996, by which Israelis vote separately for the prime minister and the members of Parliament. That has resulted in a profusion of smaller parties representing special interests, particularly the Orthodox. While Mr. Barak got a strong mandate in the popular vote, he had to turn to these smaller parties -- sometimes with contradictory interests -- to form a governing coalition.</p>
        <p>''This system has created increasing fragmentation, which makes any coalition unwieldy and unmanageable,'' said Joseph Alpher, a political analyst. ''This has been a constant in Barak's case.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, said Mr. Alpher, who had been a special adviser to Mr. Barak during the peace talks, had he reached an agreement of major proportions, he would not have been able to get it through the Parliament and would have faced new elections.</p>
        <p>He now has several options, Mr. Alpher said. He could try to continue to pursue the peace process, possibly with a renewed summit in late August, to maintain momentum. He could move to a national unity movement with the Likud Party, which would signal at least a timeout in negotiations. Or he could try to reconstitute the basic elements of his coalition, probably without the National Religious Party and Mr. Sharansky's group.</p>
        <p>''All of these options are extremely difficult,'' Mr. Alpher said.</p>
        <p>On the right, Yisrael Harel, a Jewish settler from Ofra and onetime chairman of the settler's council, took a dim view of Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>''As I see it, he has a problem with both sides, both the left and the right,'' Mr. Harel said in a telephone interview. ''The left thinks he should have conceded more, including in Jerusalem. For the right, after he has conceded the Jordan Valley, the settlements, neighborhoods of Jerusalem, it's no longer possible.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharansky, who had been the minister of interior, then set up a protest tent outside the prime minister's office two weeks ago, issued a statement calling for a national unity government.</p>
        <p>''Under today's conditions, the agreement that would have been reached at Camp David would have torn Israeli society apart from the inside and would have been disastrous for Israel's national interests,'' the statement said in apparent relief at the summit's failure, adding:</p>
        <p>''Today, more than ever, when Israel faces fateful decisions to its future, Mr. Barak must extend a hand to the heads of the opposition in Israel to set up a national unity government. Only a government representing a broad national consensus, with clearly defined red lines, can make critical decisions for the future of the state of Israel.''</p>
