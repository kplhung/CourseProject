        <p>The intense speculation that had surrounded Gov. George Bush as he selected a running mate swung today to Vice President Al Gore amid signs that the Gore camp was relieved and even joyful at Mr. Bush's choice of Dick Cheney.</p>
        <p>Advisers for the vice president said the selection of Mr. Cheney, a 59-year-old oil executive and former defense secretary, gave Mr. Gore a freer hand in picking a running mate.</p>
        <p>Democrats could hardly believe their luck.</p>
        <p>''On our side, there was maybe 70 percent relief and 30 percent glee,'' said James Carville, a Democratic strategist and longtime adviser to President Clinton.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign quickly mobilized to paint Mr. Cheney as far outside the mainstream, citing his votes against abortion and against the South African government's release of Nelson Mandela.</p>
        <p>And speculation here was that the Cheney selection elevated certain possibilities for Mr. Gore, like Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot more people viable now,'' said a Democratic strategist. ''It probably improves the chances of a 'generational' candidate -- youth, style, the future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore met with Warren Christopher, the chairman of his search committee, at Mr. Gore's residence here last night and this morning. The vice president's every move is being examined for its implications in the selection of a running mate.</p>
        <p>This morning, Mr. Gore described the meeting as part of his effort to maintain a dignified process..</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore told reporters that he was down to a short list but did not want to divulge any names.</p>
        <p>''I think it's only fair to the men and women involved to keep it private and dignified,'' he said, ''because only one person is going to be picked and the others will not be, and I want the ones who are not picked to feel respected and well treated.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Gore has managed to bump into several of his prospects along the campaign trail. He attended a fund-raising reception tonight at the Virginia home of Mr. Kerry. On Sunday, he met with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut at the Manhattan apartment of the singer Paul Simon. He begins a vacation on Thursday in North Carolina on an island that is home to Mr. Edwards. Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana will be vacationing nearby.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gore had to cancel his appearance at a dinner in Nashville last week, he asked Senator Bob Graham of Florida to fill in. After Mr. Christopher met with Mr. Gore this morning, he met with Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harkin would not say whether the 40-minute visit focused on his selection or someone else's. The senator, who has met with Mr. Christopher before, could help Mr. Gore with organized labor, farmers and the liberal wing of his party, but at 61, he could be perceived as part of the past and not the future.</p>
        <p>Amid the names, and with Mr. Bush's selection of Mr. Cheney, talk of former Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine has died down. If Mr. Bush had picked a relative newcomer, like Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Mr. Gore might have felt the need to pick an older voice of experience, like Mr. Mitchell.</p>
        <p>But supporters believe that Mr. Gore already has the experience that Mr. Bush had to seek in a running mate, and some say that frees him to pick someone with a young and vigorous image.</p>
        <p>Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, called Mr. Cheney a ''retro'' choice, indicating that Mr. Gore wanted someone who speaks to the future. Chris Lehane, also a Gore spokesman, said the selection underscored that ''this really is your father's Republican Party.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush had picked a woman, or someone who could have helped the Republicans win a critical state, Mr. Gore might have felt pressured to pick someone with the same appeal. Some in the Gore camp were worried that Mr. Bush would pick either Senator John McCain of Arizona or Gen. Colin L. Powell, both of whom might have electrified voters in a way that would have been difficult for Mr. Gore to counter.</p>
        <p>As it is, those close to the Gore campaign said, the choice of an older white man who brings little charisma to the ticket and whose home state of Wyoming was already in the Republican column, means that Mr. Gore does not have to match a particular quality or region or find a political superstar.</p>
        <p>Allan J. Lichtman, a specialist on presidential politics at American University, said: ''This gives Gore an absolute free shot, politically. It puts no pressure on him.''</p>
        <p>Mark Mellman, a Democratic consultant, said that the Cheney choice could even provide some momentum to Mr. Gore's candidacy. He said that Mr. Cheney's past heart problems prompted a flurry of stories about his health, thus squandering a chance for a spurt.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign is retreating from its earlier consideration of trying to cut into Mr. Bush's ''bounce'' from the Republican convention by announcing the Democratic running mate shortly after the Republicans leave Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Instead, one possibility was to set a date the following week in which Mr. Gore would announce his choice, a process that advisers said would bring more dignity to the selection.</p>
        <p>Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in 1988, said in an interview that the choice of Mr. Cheney ''should not make one particle of difference'' for Mr. Gore. Whatever Mr. Bush's choice, Mr. Dukakis said, Mr. Gore is still under obligation to pick someone who could step into the job of president.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't really have a free hand,'' Mr. Dukakis said. ''You still fundamentally have to pick someone who really shines as a potential president.''</p>
