        <p>Albert Takazauckas, who directed the original New York production of David Mamet's ''Sexual Perversity in Chicago'' and ''Duck Variations'' and went on to a career as a director of plays and operas, died on Monday in Los Angeles. He was 56 and lived in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>According to his father, Albert Takazauckas, he was having dinner in a restaurant and apparently suffered a  heart attack.</p>
        <p>The two Mamet one-act plays, which opened at St. Clement's in 1975, represented the playwright's New York debut. In his review in The New York Times, Mel Gussow wrote that the plays were ''fresh and pungent comedies about the rivalry within friendship and man's natural propensity for role playing.'' About ''Sexual Perversity,'' he said, ''As directed by Albert Takazauckas, the play is a multipaneled comic strip. . . The work on all counts is unforced and spontaneous.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, Mr. Takazauckas  specialized in opera and directed for regional companies around the United States, including ''Madame Butterfly'' and ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' for San Francisco's Western Opera Theater.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, he directed Hugo Weisgall's opera ''Six Characters in Search of an Author'' (based on the Pirandello play) at the Opera Festival of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>In his review in The New York Times, Anthony Tommasini said that the director's ''handling of the six rootless characters was very compelling. . . . grim, unnerving figures, ageless and bound forever to their creator's conception.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Takazauckas was born in Manhattan. In addition to his father, who lives in Manhattan, he is survived by a sister, Victoria, of Bloomfield, N.J.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 27, 2000, Thursday  An obituary yesterday about Albert Takazauckas, a director of plays and operas, misstated the day and place of his death and the city where he lived. He died on Sunday at his home in Oakland, Calif., not on Monday in Los Angeles. He did not live in Manhattan.</p>
