        <p>Along with being the team with the most victories in Major League Soccer right now, the MetroStars are also presenting a challenge for the U.S. Cup title. They reached the quarterfinal stage of the 87-year-old competition tonight with a 3-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Mutiny before 5,183 at the Mitchel Athletic Complex.</p>
        <p>Mark Chung, Alex Comas and Clint Mathis scored, and Tim Howard registered the shutout for the MetroStars, who will next meet the Columbus Crew, also of M.L.S., in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Cup, the oldest national competition in this country. That game will most likely be played here on Aug. 9.</p>

        <p>Along with being the team with the most victories in Major League Soccer right now, the MetroStars are also presenting a challenge for the U.S. Cup title. They reached the quarterfinal stage of the 87-year-old competition tonight with a 3-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Mutiny before 5,183 at the Mitchel Athletic Complex.</p>
        <p>Mark Chung, Alex Comas and Clint Mathis scored, and Tim Howard registered the shutout for the MetroStars, who will next meet the Columbus Crew, also of M.L.S., in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Cup, the oldest national competition in this country. That game will most likely be played here on Aug. 9.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars were vastly superior for the greatest part of the game against the Mutiny, which leads the Central Division of M.L.S., and were never in serious trouble, posting their sixth consecutive victory and extending their undefeated streak to 11 games (9-0-2), including two victories in the U.S. Cup.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars could have had 3 goals before the game was 10 minutes old, but they were denied by the Mutiny backup goalkeeper, Andy Kirk, who has not seen any league action this season. Kirk was simply brilliant in the early stages, but he found himself helpless on the first three goals.</p>
        <p>Petter Villegas started Chung's goal with a move and a cross from the right side that found Chung at the edge of the penalty area on the left. Chung took a blistering shot with his left foot that found the target through a crowd and behind the screened Kirk in the 23rd minute.</p>
        <p>Comas scored the second goal just seven minutes later from close range on the left after a pass by Roy Myers, who left shortly afterward with a pulled calf muscle in his left leg. Daniel Hernandez also left in the second half with a sprained right knee. They were replaced by Ramiro Corrales and Mark Semioli.</p>
        <p>Mathis, who along with Tab Ramos missed the previous two games while with the United States national team during World Cup qualifying, scored the third goal with a ferocious volley from 10 yards away in the 51st minute, giving Kirk no chance.</p>
        <p>With M.L.S. taking a break before its All-Star Game on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio, the MetroStars, who are 13-7-2 in league play, hold a 9-point lead over New England in the East. The Mutiny, 12-9-2 in M.L.S., leads Chicago by 3 in the Central.</p>
