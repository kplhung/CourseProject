        <p>IMPORTED free-range chickens processed by a new method are winning converts among New York chefs and could be in supermarkets this fall.</p>
        <p>Giannone Poultry, in St. Cuthbert, northeast of Montreal, has devised a technique for chilling its freshly slaughtered chickens with frigid air instead of water.

        <p>IMPORTED free-range chickens processed by a new method are winning converts among New York chefs and could be in supermarkets this fall.</p>
        <p>Giannone Poultry, in St. Cuthbert, northeast of Montreal, has devised a technique for chilling its freshly slaughtered chickens with frigid air instead of water. As a result, said Tony Giannone, the sales director, the birds are less likely to breed bacteria and also absorb no liquid; the taste and texture both benefit.</p>
        <p>Giannone chickens are ''the closest in flavor and juiciness to the famous poulet de Bresse of France,'' said David Cunningham, the chef at the Lenox Room, on the Upper East Side. Mr. Cunningham, who has cooked in France, was among the first to showcase the Canadian chickens on his menu.</p>
        <p>The birds are big and meaty, with great chicken taste. They are raised on corn, soy and wheat and receive no antibiotics or growth hormones.</p>
        <p>Company officials studied chicken processing in Europe before developing the new method, which uses air to evenly chill eviscerated chickens as they travel through a cooling room for exactly 64 minutes, reaching a temperature of 34 degrees. The technique was designed to meet the strict sanitary rules of the Canadian and United States agriculture departments.</p>
        <p>The usual final step of spraying the birds with water to keep them from drying out is eliminated. The chickens are immediately packaged using a new process that gives them a 10-to-14-day shelf life.</p>
        <p>Giannone chickens are served at Bouterin, the Brasserie, Monkey Bar, Clementine, Tabla, Della Femina and the Water Club and at the Ryland Inn in Whitehouse, N.J. At retail, whole Giannone chickens are $1.95 a pound from D'Artagnan, (800) 327-8246.</p>
