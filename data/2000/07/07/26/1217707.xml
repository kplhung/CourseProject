      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>OVER the last 15 years, New Zealand has earned a reputation for producing superb sauvignon blancs, but if you speak to  New Zealand winemakers, you sense they would rather talk about something else. ''If you think the sauvignon blancs are good, wait until you taste our chardonnays and pinot noirs,'' they will say.</p>
        <p>Their attitude is not difficult to understand. If winemaking were the Olympics, ever-popular chardonnay and pinot noir would be center stage at high noon, like the long jump and 100-meter dash, while sauvignon blanc would be relegated to the wee hours. Who is ever remembered for winning the badminton competition?</p>

        <p>OVER the last 15 years, New Zealand has earned a reputation for producing superb sauvignon blancs, but if you speak to  New Zealand winemakers, you sense they would rather talk about something else. ''If you think the sauvignon blancs are good, wait until you taste our chardonnays and pinot noirs,'' they will say.</p>
        <p>Their attitude is not difficult to understand. If winemaking were the Olympics, ever-popular chardonnay and pinot noir would be center stage at high noon, like the long jump and 100-meter dash, while sauvignon blanc would be relegated to the wee hours. Who is ever remembered for winning the badminton competition?</p>
        <p>Having tasted some New Zealand chardonnays and pinot noirs, I think it's fair to say that most of these wines are not yet ready to compete in the finals. But the sauvignon blancs are another story.</p>
        <p>The best of them combine the vivid citrus and herbal flavors of Sancerre with a richness and depth that is New Zealand's own contribution to sauvignon blanc wines.</p>
        <p>The better New Zealand sauvignon blancs are also fine food companions, versatile enough to stand up to the spice of chili peppers or the power of salmon.</p>
        <p>Cloudy Bay is the best-known New Zealand winemaker, and its sauvignon blancs have excelled year after year, with a predictable rise in prices. But many other good, less expensive wines are also available, especially now that the 1999 vintage has come into the stores.</p>
        <p>Sauvignon blancs are excellent when young and fresh. As in France, the best are fermented in steel tanks, with the flavor coming from the purity of the fruit, so beware the occasional New Zealand sauvignon blanc that is labeled barrel-fermented. What you will taste is a mouthful of oak.</p>
        <p>It may be true that, like Olympic badminton athletes, sauvignon blanc doesn't get the respect it deserves. But eventually, excellence of all sorts is rewarded, and one day New Zealand will be able to show off its medals.</p>
        <p>CLOUDY BAY, MARLBOROUGH 1999: $24  Beautiful wine with depth, precision and persistence.</p>
        <p>. . .  TRINITY HILL, SHEPHERDS CROFT, HAWKES BAY 1999: $13  Lovely and well rounded with a touch of sweetness, citrus and mint.</p>
        <p>. . .  GOLDWATER ESTATE, DOG POINT, MARLBOROUGH 1999: $19  Rich and powerful with a strong, tangy aroma.</p>
        <p>. . .  OMAKA SPRINGS, MARLBOROUGH 1999: $13  Potent aromas of citrus and tarragon, fresh and delicious.</p>
        <p>. . .  LAWSON'S DRY HILLS, MARLBOROUGH 1999: $15  Rich, ripe and racy with layers of flavor.</p>
        <p>. . .  KIM CRAWFORD WINES, MARLBOROUGH 1999: $16  Mint and licorice aromas; citrus flavors with good texture and weight.</p>
        <p>Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in various Manhattan wine shops.</p>
