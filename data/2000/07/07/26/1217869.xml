        <p>The refusal of Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to negotiate away his claims to Jerusalem may have dashed American hopes of a Camp David peace agreement today, but it allowed him to return home with his credibility among Arab and Muslim leaders intact, Middle East analysts said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat is expected to solidify that backing with a round of consultations in the region, beginning in Egypt on Wednesday morning with a visit with President Hosni Mubarak in the port city of Alexandria.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials here said Mr. Arafat would probably meet soon with many of the Arab leaders who had urged him, in public statements and in private telephone conversations, to hold firm on his demands for an end to Israel's 33 years of control over East Jerusalem and the Old City.</p>
        <p>The question of Jerusalem, which contains sites holy to Muslims and Christians as well as to Jews, was said to have been the main sticking point in the intense negotiations at Camp David in pursuit of a settlement to the long Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</p>
        <p>There was no official reaction from Arab capitals to the announcement that the Camp David talks had ended. A spokesman for the Arab League in Cairo said officials would wait until Mr. Arafat briefs them on his negotiations.</p>
        <p>Arab television channels, which are state owned, reported the end of the talks without commentary.</p>
        <p>However, on Al-Jezeera satellite television, owned by a member of the ruling family of the Gulf state of Qatar and one of the few outlets for debate in the Arab world, the analysis supported Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>''Clinton said Israel compromised more than the Palestinians, but this is not accurate,'' Helmi Barakat, a political analyst based in Washington, said in a Jezeera interview. ''According to international law, Jerusalem is occupied land and I do not believe the Arabs should be expected to compromise or give up their sovereignty over Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>During the last few days, a number of Arab leaders like Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudia Arabia and President Mubarak have joined with Mr. Arafat's domestic opponents in Islamic militant movements to weigh in on the issue. They all but threatened Mr. Arafat with political excommunication if he accepted Prime Minister Ehud Barak's proposals for administrative control over parts of the city and access to -- but not sovereignty over -- the major Muslim sites.</p>
        <p>Experts said, however, that Mr. Arafat did not need reminders.</p>
        <p>''Arafat knew beforehand that any compromise on Jerusalem would be the end of Arafat,'' said Tahsin Basheer, a former aide to Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian president who was the first Arab leader to make peace with Israel, in 1979.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials said Mr. Arafat was acutely aware, throughout the peace talks, that Jerusalem was an especially sensitive issue for the Arab leaders whose support he needed.</p>
        <p>''We recognize that here in Egypt, just like in Saudi Arabia, in Jordan and elsewhere in the region, the leaders have to worry about their own home constituencies when it comes to Jerusalem,'' said Mohammed Subieh, the general secretary of the Palestine National Council and the Palestinian representative in the Arab League in Cairo.</p>
        <p>Arab control of the Old City has been a rallying cry for Palestinian nationalists, and for Islamic fundamentalists that have violently opposed any Arab leadership that attempted to normalize relations between Arabs and Israelis.</p>
        <p>An uncompromising view toward the status of East Jerusalem, which was controlled by Jordan from 1947 until 1967, has also been the standard position of Arab religious leaders, both Christian and Muslim.</p>
        <p>President Mubarak, who has been involved in the Arab-Israeli peace effort for years, conferred with Mr. Arafat during the talks. But he did not follow the American line and push Mr. Arafat to compromise, as he has before on issues other than Jerusalem, Egyptian officials and diplomats in Cairo said.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Mubarak's information director, Maged Abdel Fattah, said earlier this week, the Egyptian president saw his role as helping American diplomats, and not Mr. Arafat,  understand that Christian and Muslim Arabs around the world could accept only certain ''parameters'' when it came to Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Still, as President Clinton said in his post-mortem on the negotiations, these were the first substantive talks between an Arab leader and an Israeli leader on the subject of Jerusalem. But outside the presidential retreat, analysts said, the talks also revived old shibboleths and emotions that could be difficult to contain.</p>
        <p>''Going home, on the face of it, empty-handed, creates a problem of damage control,'' a former diplomat said. ''Fourteen days of uninterrupted negotiations made the anti-peace forces on both sides very active. Everyone is trying to remobilize their forces and their arguments, even arguments from 30 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials, however, expressed some hope that some agreement could be salvaged before mid-September, when Mr. Arafat has pledged he will declare a Palestinian state. ''Let us wait and see,'' said Mr. Subieh when asked if the pledge would be kept. ''Clinton has promised to send one of his senior people to the region and we are hoping that will help.''</p>
        <p>In the West Bank, another Palestinian official said he hoped to see broad Arab support rallied behind Mr. Arafat so that he could continue to negotiate. ''There is still a chance until Sept. 13,'' Marwan al-Bargout, a leader of the Palestinian Fatah faction, said on Jezeera. ''We are calling upon Arab nations and leaders to support the Palestinians and hold an emergency Arab summit.''</p>
