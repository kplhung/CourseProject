        <p>New Jersey received an additional $11 million in federal aid yesterday for some of the poorest  residents affected by flooding in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Floyd last September.</p>
        <p>The money is to be spent on repairs, rental assistance or new home purchases for residents whose incomes do not exceed 50 percent of the median in each of the nine counties most affected by the flooding.</p>
        <p>The funds come in addition to a larger and more generally focused $30 million in public works and economic development assistance.</p>
        <p>Both measures were passed by Congress this month and signed into law by President Clinton on July 13.</p>
        <p>The money will be administered by the State Division of Community Affairs, which had determined months ago that there were still many in the state living with relatives, unable to repair their homes or running low on rent money while they awaited  more permanent assistance.</p>
        <p>Maureen Hassett, a senior policy adviser to the state agency, said that because the income levels in the nine affected counties vary so widely, a family of four in wealthy Somerset County, with earnings as much as $40,000 annually, would be eligible for the same kind of assistance as a similarly sized family in Passaic County earning just $16,000 a year.</p>
        <p>The nine counties are Bergen, Somerset, Essex, Passaic, Union, Morris, Middlesex, Hunterdon and Mercer.</p>
        <p>The extra help was announced  by Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and a bipartisan group of New Jersey's Congressional representatives.</p>
        <p>Governor Whitman praised the federal agency for the speed with which it delivered the money.</p>
